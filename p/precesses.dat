5|$|The {{role of the}} {{gyroscopic}} effect in most bike designs is to help steer the front wheel into {{the direction of a}} lean. This phenomenon is called precession and the rate at which an object <b>precesses</b> is inversely proportional to its rate of spin. The slower a front wheel spins, the faster it will precess when the bike leans, and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|Ida's {{rotation}} period is 4.63 hours, {{making it one}} of the fastest rotating asteroids yet discovered. The calculated maximum moment of inertia of a uniformly dense object the same shape as Ida coincides with the spin axis of the asteroid. This suggests that there are no major variations of density within the asteroid. Ida's axis of rotation <b>precesses</b> with a period of 77 thousand years, due to the gravity of the Sun acting upon the nonspherical shape of the asteroid.|$|E

5|$|Triton's orbit is {{associated}} with two tilts, the inclination of Neptune's spin to Neptune's orbit, 30°, and the inclination of Triton's orbit to Neptune's spin, 157° (an inclination over 90° indicates retrograde motion). Triton's orbit <b>precesses</b> forward relative to Neptune's spin with {{a period of about}} 678 Earth years (4.1 Neptunian years), making its Neptune-orbit-relative inclination vary between 127° and 180° and in the past, to 173°. That inclination is currently 130°; Triton's orbit is now near its maximum departure from coplanarity with Neptune's.|$|E
5|$|The {{motion of}} the Moon can be {{measured}} accurately, and is noticeably more complex {{than that of the}} planets. The ancient Greek astronomers, Hipparchus and Ptolemy, had noted several periodic variations in the Moon's orbit, such as small oscillations in its orbital eccentricity and the inclination of its orbit to the plane of the ecliptic. These oscillations generally occur on a once-monthly or twice-monthly time-scale. The line of its apses <b>precesses</b> gradually with a period of roughly 8.85 years, while its line of nodes turns a full circle in roughly double that time, 18.6 years. This accounts for the roughly 18-year periodicity of eclipses, the so-called Saros cycle. However, both lines experience small fluctuations in their motion, again on the monthly time-scale.|$|E
5|$|The bending of the Laplace {{plane of}} the Solar System toward that of Planet Nine's orbit can produce the {{apparent}} clustering of the longitude of the ascending nodes and arguments of perihelion of the extreme TNOs. The Laplace plane defines the center about which the pole of an object's orbit <b>precesses</b> with time. At larger semi-major axes the angular momentum of Planet Nine causes the Laplace plane to bend toward that of its orbit. As a result, when the poles of the eTNO orbit precess about the Laplace plane, they tend to remain {{on one side of}} the ecliptic pole. For objects with small inclination relative to Planet Nine, which were found to be more stable in simulations, this off-center precession resembles a libration of the longitudes of ascending nodes with respect to the ecliptic making them appear clustered. In combination with the anti-alignment of the longitudes of perihelion this can also produce clustering of the arguments of perihelion.|$|E

50|$|Significant {{orbital plane}} changes are {{normally}} very fuel-intensive, but orbital perturbations aid the process. The Earth's equatorial bulge causes the orbital right ascension of the ascending node (RAAN) to <b>precess</b> {{at a rate}} that depends mainly on the period and inclination. The Iridium satellites have an inclination of 86.4°, which places every satellite in a prograde (inclination < 90°) orbit. This causes their equator crossings to steadily <b>precess</b> westward.|$|R
5000|$|Thus, if the {{specimen}} {{of interest is}} quite small, the maximum precession angle will be restrained. This is most significant for conditions of convergent beam illumination. 50 nm is a general lower limit on probe size for standard TEMs operating at high precession angles (>30mRad), but can be surpassed in Cs corrected instruments. [...] In principle the minimum <b>precessed</b> probe can reach approximately the full-width-half-max (FWHM) of the converged un-precessed probe in any instrument, however in practice the effective <b>precessed</b> probe is typically ~10-50x larger due to uncontrolled aberrations present at high angles of tilt. For example, a 2 nm <b>precessed</b> probe with >40 mrad precession angle was demonstrated in an aberration-corrected Nion UltraSTEM with native sub-Å probe (aberrations corrected to ~35 mrad half-angle).|$|R
25|$|In addition, {{the orbital}} ellipse itself <b>precesses</b> in space, in an {{irregular}} fashion, completing a full cycle every 112,000 years {{relative to the}} fixed stars. Apsidal precession occurs in {{the plane of the}} ecliptic and alters the orientation of the Earth's orbit relative to the ecliptic. This happens primarily as a result of interactions with Jupiter and Saturn. Smaller contributions are also made by the sun's oblateness and by the effects of general relativity that are well known for Mercury.|$|E
25|$|High speed {{photometry}} of {{the system}} shows multiple periods of variation in the luminosity. The main period of seconds (17m 8.73s) is the orbital period of the pair. A secondary period of seconds (17m 31s) {{is believed to be}} caused by a superhump—an elevated outburst in the signal that occurs with a period slightly longer than the orbital period. The superhump {{may be the result of}} an elongation of the accretion disk in combination with precession. The elliptical disk <b>precesses</b> about the white dwarf over a time interval much longer than the orbital period, causing a slight change in the orientation of the disk over each orbit.|$|E
25|$|The Earth is not {{a perfect}} sphere but an oblate spheroid, with an {{equatorial}} diameter about 43 kilometers larger than its polar diameter. Because of the Earth's axial tilt, {{during most of the}} year the half of this bulge that is closest to the Sun is off-center, either to the north or to the south, and the far half is off-center on the opposite side. The gravitational pull on the closer half is stronger, since gravity decreases with distance, so this creates a small torque on the Earth as the Sun pulls harder {{on one side of the}} Earth than the other. The axis of this torque is roughly perpendicular to the axis of the Earth's rotation so the axis of rotation <b>precesses.</b> If the Earth were a perfect sphere, there would be no precession.|$|E

25|$|The axis of {{rotation}} itself <b>precesses</b> around the pipe axis resulting in a rotating force at the pipe exit and results in a rotating dipole sound field. Studies of this whistle have shown that dynamic similarity based on the pipe diameter d as the characteristic length scale, and inlet mean flow speed U as the characteristic speed was not achieved, {{as shown in the}} lower figure on the right. A more correct speed would be that characteristic of the swirl fd, where f is the precession (and sound) frequency, based on the Rossby number. To test the relevance of this new characteristic speed, the flow rate was increased and the frequency and level of the sound was measured. Using the dipole model, the calculated force was found to be nearly proportional to (fd)2, confirming the correctness of the new characteristic speed.|$|E
25|$|The mean {{inclination}} of {{the lunar}} orbit to the ecliptic plane is 5.145°. The rotational axis of the Moon is also not perpendicular to its orbital plane, so the lunar equator {{is not in the}} plane of its orbit, but is inclined to it by a constant value of 6.688° (this is the obliquity). This does not mean that, {{as a result of the}} precession of the Moon's orbital plane, the angle between the lunar equator and the ecliptic would vary between the sum (11.833°) and difference (1.543°) of these two angles, but, as was discovered by Jacques Cassini in 1722, the rotational axis of the Moon <b>precesses</b> with the same rate as its orbital plane, but is 180° out of phase (see Cassini's Laws). Therefore, the angle between the ecliptic and the lunar equator is always 1.543°, even though the rotational axis of the Moon is not fixed with respect to the stars.|$|E

500|$|When {{a neutron}} {{is put into}} a {{magnetic}} field produced by an external source, it is subject to a torque tending to orient its magnetic moment parallel to the field (hence its spin antiparallel to the field). [...] Like any magnet, the amount of this torque is proportional both to the magnetic moment and the external magnetic field. [...] Since the neutron has spin angular momentum, this torque will cause the neutron to precess with a well-defined frequency, called the Larmor frequency. It is this phenomenon that enables the measurement of nuclear properties through nuclear magnetic resonance. The Larmor frequency can {{be determined by the}} product of the gyromagnetic ratio with the magnetic field strength. Since the sign of γn is negative, the neutron's spin angular momentum <b>precesses</b> counterclockwise about the direction of the external magnetic field.|$|E

(Note that the term [...] "equinox" [...] here refers to a point on the celestial sphere so defined, rather than the moment in time when the Sun is overhead at the Equator, though the two meanings are related.) When the axis <b>precesses</b> from one orientation to another, the equatorial plane of the Earth (indicated by the circular grid around the equator) moves. The celestial equator is just the Earth's equator projected onto the celestial sphere, so it moves as the Earth's equatorial plane moves, and the intersection with the ecliptic moves with it. The positions of the poles and equator on Earth do not change, only {{the orientation of the}} Earth against the fixed stars.|$|E

[...] If, on the other hand, the axis of the top points in the binormal direction, then it is observed to rotate with angular velocity -κ. [...] This is easily visualized in the case when the curvature is a positive constant and the torsion vanishes. [...] The observer is then in uniform circular motion. [...] If the top points {{in the direction of the}} binormal, then by conservation of angular momentum it must rotate in the opposite direction of the circular motion. [...] In the limiting case when the curvature vanishes, the observer's normal <b>precesses</b> about the tangent vector, and similarly the top will rotate in the opposite direction of this precession.|$|E
2500|$|Applying such a pulse {{to a set}} {{of nuclear}} spins {{simultaneously}} excites all the single-quantum NMR transitions. In terms of the net magnetization vector, this corresponds to tilting the magnetization vector away from its equilibrium position (aligned along the external magnetic field). The out-of-equilibrium magnetization vector <b>precesses</b> about the external magnetic field vector at the NMR frequency of the spins. This oscillating magnetization vector induces a current in a nearby pickup coil, creating an electrical signal oscillating at the NMR frequency. This signal is known as the free induction decay (FID), and it contains the vector sum of the NMR responses from all the excited spins. In order to obtain the frequency-domain NMR spectrum (NMR absorption intensity vs. NMR frequency) this time-domain signal (intensity vs. time) must be Fourier transformed. Fortunately the development of Fourier Transform NMR coincided with the development of digital computers and the digital Fast Fourier Transform.
