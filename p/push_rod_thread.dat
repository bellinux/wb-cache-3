40|$|AbstractThe {{reliability}} of aerospace relay directly influences the {{reliability of}} the whole system. The analysis and research on the optimum position of aerospace relay's <b>pushing</b> <b>rod</b> are an important process of aerospace relay reliability design. In the past, most researches were done for electromagnetic systems and spring systems of aerospace relays. However, there was not any research on the position of the <b>pushing</b> <b>rod.</b> An analytical method for the optimum position of aerospace relay's <b>pushing</b> <b>rod</b> is presented in this paper. From four aspects, including the electromagnetic force and torque, work done by the electromagnetic force and displacement, the optimum position of a <b>pushing</b> <b>rod</b> is investigated based on the analysis of a straight spring system. The conclusions can be used to direct the optimum design and assembling of aerospace relays...|$|R
30|$|There are two {{different}} failure modes (<b>threaded</b> <b>rod</b> tensile fracture and <b>threaded</b> <b>rod</b> pullout fracture) for glued-in rods on connection strength of bamboo glulam. In <b>threaded</b> <b>rod</b> tensile fracture mode, rod necking and tensile fracture of the <b>threaded</b> <b>rod</b> also were found. However, in <b>threaded</b> <b>rod</b> pullout fracture mode, interface shear failure of the bamboo glulam around the anchoring zone of the <b>threaded</b> <b>rod</b> happened. The mechanical performances and the failure modes of the glued-in rod materials are mainly influenced by the inherent base materials.|$|R

30|$|When {{the rods}} {{were in the}} same {{slenderness}} ratio λ but different <b>threaded</b> <b>rod</b> diameters d, the influence of the <b>threaded</b> <b>rod</b> diameter d on peak load was analyzed. As Fig.  3 showed that the peak load increased with <b>threaded</b> <b>rod</b> diameters. When λ =  5, as <b>threaded</b> <b>rod</b> diameters increasing, the failure mode of three series samples (M 8, M 12, M 16) changed from <b>threaded</b> <b>rod</b> tensile fracture to pull out fracture. However, when λ ≥  10, the failure mode of three series samples (M 8, M 12, M 16) was same which was <b>threaded</b> <b>rod</b> tensile fracture (Table  1). Therefore, to satisfy the utilization of glued <b>threaded</b> <b>rods</b> connection bamboo glulam in engineering and structure, λ ≥  10 was very necessary.|$|R

40|$|A side-slide {{actuator}} and a corrugated diaphragm actuator will {{be analyzed}} and optimized this summer. Coupled electrostatic and fluid analyses {{will also be}} initiated. Both the side-slide actuator and the corrugated diaphragm actuator {{will be used to}} regulate the flow of fuel in a jet engine. Many of the side-slide actuators will be placed on top of a fuel injector that is still in the developmental stage as well. The corrugated diaphragm actuator will also be used to regulate the flow of fuel in fuel injectors. A comparative analysis of the performance matrix of both actuators will be conducted. The side-slide actuator uses the concept of mechanical advantage to regulate the flow of fuel using electrostatic forces. It is made from Nickel, Silicon Carbide, and thin layers of Oxide. The slider will have a hole in the middle that will allow fuel to pass through the hole underneath it. The goal is to regulate the flow of fuel through the inlet. This means that the actuator needs to be designed so that when a voltage is applied to the <b>push</b> <b>rod,</b> the slider will deflect in the x-direction and be able to completely block the inlet and no fuel can pass through. Different voltage levels will be tested. The parameters that are being optimized are the thickness of the diaphragm, what kind of corrugation the diaphragm should have, the length, width, and thickness of the <b>push</b> <b>rod,</b> and what design should be used to return the slider. The current possibilities for a return rod are a built in spring on the slider, a return rod that acts like a spring, or a return rod that is identical to the <b>push</b> <b>rod.</b> The final actuator design should have a <b>push</b> <b>rod</b> that has rotational motion and no translation motion, a <b>push</b> <b>rod</b> thickness that prevents warping due to the slider, and a large ratio of the displacement {{on the bottom of the}} <b>push</b> <b>rod</b> to displacement on the top of the <b>push</b> <b>rod.</b> The corrugated diaphragm actuator was optimized last winter and this summer will be spent completing the optimization of the coupled electrostatic and fluid flow parameters. It was found that Nickel is the best material to use for the diaphragm because it has a higher yield strength and allows for a larger stress, deflection and applied pressure. The parameters that were optimized were the wavelength and thickness of the diaphragm...|$|R

For this reason the B.E.12 and the R.E.8, not to mention Vickers' own FB 19, mounted their forward-firing machine guns on the port side of the fuselage so that a relatively short version of the <b>push</b> <b>rod</b> could be linked directly to the gun.|$|R
