5|$|Astrology is {{the study}} of the {{movements}} and relative <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> celestial objects as a means for divining information about human affairs and terrestrial events. Astrology has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium BCE, and has its roots in calendrical systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications. Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical events, and some – such as the Indians, Chinese, and Maya – developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations. Western astrology, one of the oldest astrological systems still in use, can trace its roots to 19th–17th century BCE Mesopotamia, from which it spread to Ancient Greece, Rome, the Arab world and eventually Central and Western Europe. Contemporary Western astrology is often associated with systems of horoscopes that purport to explain aspects of a person's personality and predict significant events in their lives based on the <b>positions</b> <b>of</b> celestial objects; the majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems.|$|E

40|$|Precise object {{manipulation}} by a robot requires precise knowledge <b>of</b> the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> {{the robot}} endeffector {{relative to the}} object. By the so-called eye-to-hand coordination, both the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> the object and the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> the robot relative to the camera are determined. In practice, usually the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> the robot base to camera is calibrated in advanced and the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> the robot endeffector relative to the base is calculated by forward kinematics with joint angle confgurations. For the robots working in the human environment, they are constructed with lightweight {{in order to increase}} security, which achieves lower stiffness than industrial robots. Thus, the reached <b>position</b> <b>of</b> robot-effector deviates from its commanded <b>position.</b> The work <b>of</b> this thsis is to develop a method based on the image processing to minimize deviations and thus to estimate the real <b>position</b> <b>of</b> the robot endeffector in real time.
