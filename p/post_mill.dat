5|$|The Kasteel Meulen ("Castle Windmill") is a <b>post</b> <b>mill</b> {{situated}} on the highest point of Mont Cassel {{on the site of}} the former castle. A windmill constructed here in the 16th century burned down on 30 October 1911. It was replaced in 1947 by an 18th-century windmill that was moved from nearby Arnèke, one of around twenty that once existed in the area. The mill is open to the public and still operates daily during the high season.|$|E
5|$|Restoration work in 1984 cost £2,918. Grants {{received}} were £1,209 from English Heritage, £500 from St Edmundsbury Borough Council, Other donations {{amounted to}} £52. Income from open {{days at the}} mill came to £151. A boost to the funds was £2,000 from Hervey Benham. This money had been allocated to allow the moving of a derelict <b>post</b> <b>mill</b> buck to Thelnetham. In the end, the removal was not proceeded with, and Mr Benham allowed the donation to remain with the Thelnetham Mill Preservation Trust. The project received further support in local media, including the East Anglian Daily Times, one of the work-ins being featured on Anglia Television's About Anglia programme.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} <b>post</b> <b>mills</b> {{were quite}} small, and {{this led to}} problems with stability as they were liable to blow down in strong winds.

It was marked on the 1819–20 Ordnance Survey map, Greenwoods map of 1821 and the Farningham Tithe Map of 1840.
