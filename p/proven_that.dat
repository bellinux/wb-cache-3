30|$|Developing {{the notion}} of K-homotopy in the {{category}} of Khalimsky topological spaces, we have developed the notions of contractibility and local contractibility induced by the K-homotopy. Besides, <b>proving</b> <b>that</b> digital contractibilities imply local contractibilities for a K-contractible space X, we wondered if the space X has the FPP. In this paper, we <b>proved</b> <b>that</b> not every K-topological space with K-contractibility has the FPP. More precisely, for SC_K^n,l, we <b>proved</b> <b>that</b> SC_K^n,l does not have the FPP. For instance, we <b>proved</b> <b>that</b> whereas SC_K^n, 4 is K-contractible, it cannot have the FPP. However, we <b>proved</b> <b>that</b> a simple K-path has the FPP. In addition, we <b>proved</b> <b>that</b> in KTC the FPP is a K-topological invariant.|$|R

5|$|The {{court held}} that it was <b>proven</b> <b>that</b> Blythe had thrown Nosek off the stage. However, Blythe, due to his nearsightedness, could have mistaken Nosek for the other fan who had {{repeatedly}} gotten over the guardrail. According to the court, the largest part of the blame lies with the promoters and security members. Judge Kubovec further reproached Blythe for not having met with the Nosek family.|$|E

5|$|She was {{an elder}} sister of Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, whose alleged {{escape from the}} {{assassination}} of the imperial family was rumored for nearly 90 years. However, it was later <b>proven</b> <b>that</b> Anastasia did not escape. In the 1990s, it was suggested that Maria might have been the grand duchess whose remains were missing from the Romanov grave that was discovered near Yekaterinburg, Russia and exhumed in 1991. However, further remains were discovered in 2007, and DNA analysis subsequently proved that the entire Imperial family had been murdered in 1918.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} of the current citadel was first fortified in 1076 by the Turkman warlord Atsiz bin Uvak, although it is possible but not <b>proven</b> <b>that</b> a citadel stood on this place in the Hellenistic and Roman periods. After the assassination of Atsiz bin Uvak, the project was finished by the Seljuq ruler Tutush I. The emirs of the subsequent Burid and Zengid dynasties carried out modifications and added new structures to it. During this period, the citadel and the city were besieged several times by Crusader and Muslim armies. In 1174, the citadel was captured by Saladin, the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt, who made it his residence and had the defences and residential buildings modified.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the Second World War, Waddington was {{appointed}} chairman of the North Eastern Division Advisory Committee for the Control of Oils and Fats and became an agent of the Ministry of Food. His responsibilities included arranging for the storage of fats. When the war concluded, he was charged with conspiracy to defraud the Ministry of Food when it was discovered that a letter detailing amounts of money had been altered. The prosecution alleged that between 1943 and 1944, Waddington and the manager of another fat storage firm shared £1,600 between them which should have gone to the latter's company when the price paid by the Ministry for storage increased. Waddington denied all knowledge; his brother Priestley, another director at the family firm, said that he made the arrangements to pay a portion of the increased fees to Waddington's co-defendant without the knowledge of Waddington. Waddington was acquitted when a judge ruled {{that there was no way}} that it could be <b>proven</b> <b>that</b> he had known of the alteration to the letter, or that he was in any way responsible.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the best}} efforts of his father to secure a {{favorable}} venue, judge, and defense team, on January 31, 1825, the jury convicted Isaac Desha of murder and sentenced him to hang. Rowan immediately requested a new trial upon grounds of jury interference, and Shannon granted the request on February 10. Jury selection proved problematic, occupying at least parts of four terms of the Harrison County Circuit Court. In September 1825, a jury was finally empaneled. The judge, Harry O. Brown, had been temporarily appointed to his position by Governor Desha to fill a vacancy. Desha was again found guilty, and sentenced to hang on July 14, 1826. Judge Brown overturned the verdict because the prosecution had not <b>proven</b> <b>that</b> the murder took place in Fleming County, as alleged in the indictment against Desha. The state argued that this was of no consequence, since a change of venue had already been granted, but the judge's ruling stood, and Governor Desha's reputation took a further hit.|$|E
5|$|On Elizabeth's {{death in}} 1603 she was succeeded by James I. Strongly {{influenced}} by Scotland's {{separation from the}} Catholic Church during the Scottish Reformation, James was intensely interested in Protestant theology, focusing much of his curiosity on the theology of witchcraft. By the early 1590s he had become convinced {{that he was being}} plotted against by Scottish witches. After a visit to Denmark, he had attended the trial in 1590 of the North Berwick witches, who were convicted of using witchcraft to send a storm against the ship that carried James and his wife Anne back to Scotland. In 1597 he wrote a book, Daemonologie, instructing his followers that they must denounce and prosecute any supporters or practitioners of witchcraft. One year after James acceded to the English throne, a law was enacted imposing the death penalty in cases where it was <b>proven</b> <b>that</b> harm had been caused through the use of magic, or corpses had been exhumed for magical purposes. James was, however, sceptical of the evidence presented in witch trials, even to the extent of personally exposing discrepancies in the testimonies presented against some accused witches.|$|E

5|$|Other {{plants that}} are {{considered}} to be protocarnivorous have sticky trichomes on some surface, such as the flower scape and bud of Stylidium and Plumbago, the bracts of Passiflora foetida, and leaves of Roridula. The trichomes of Stylidium, which appear below the flower, have been known to trap and kill small insects since their discovery several centuries ago, but their purpose remained ambiguous. In November 2006, Dr. Douglas Darnowski published a paper describing the active digestion of proteins when they come in contact with a trichome of a Stylidium species grown in aseptic tissue culture, proving that the plant, rather than the surface microbes, was the source of protease production. Darnowski asserts in that paper that given this evidence, Stylidium species are properly called carnivorous, though in order to fulfill the strict definition of carnivory it needs to be <b>proven</b> <b>that</b> they are capable of absorbing nutrients derived from prey and that this adaptation gives the plants some competitive advantage.|$|E
5|$|The 1907 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was at one}} point the only Atlantic {{hurricane season}} that did not feature a hurricane. With only five tropical storms having formed, it was a relatively inactive season; of those that did, three made landfall, of which all occurred on the shoreline of the Gulf Coast of the United States. The first storm of the season formed on June24, while the final dissipated on November12. Damage from the storms were minimal, and no deaths were reported. Due to the lack of modern technology, including satellite imagery, information is often sparse, and four additional systems could have formed during the season. A documentation for four possible storms during the season exists, although it has not been <b>proven</b> <b>that</b> these systems were fully tropical.|$|E
5|$|The {{forensic}} {{examination of}} the lead pipes found {{at the murder scene}} and in the Corsair's boot revealed traces of blood on the pipe from 46Lower Belgrave Street. This proved to be a mixture of Lady Lucan's (blood group A) and Sandra Rivett's (B) blood. Hair belonging to Veronica Lucan was also found on that pipe, but none belonging to Sandra Rivett. The pipe found inside the car had neither blood nor hair on it. Home Office scientists were unable to prove conclusively that both pipes were cut from the same, longer, piece of piping, although they thought it likely. The tape wrapped around both was similar, but those too could not be conclusively linked. The letters written to Bill Shand-Kydd were stained with blood considered to be from both women. The letter to Michael Stoop had no blood on it, but it was later <b>proven</b> <b>that</b> the paper it was written on had been torn from a writing pad found in the Corsair's boot.|$|E
