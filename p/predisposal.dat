40|$|Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a {{major cause}} of lower {{respiratory}} tract infections in infants and the elderly. While the primary infection is the most serious, reinfection of the upper airway throughout life is the rule. Although relatively little is known about either RSV infection of the upper respiratory tract or host mucosal immunity to RSV, recent literature suggests that RSV is the predominant viral pathogen predisposing to bacterial otitis media (OM). Herein, we describe mouse and chinchilla models of RSV infection of the nasopharynx and Eustachian tube. Both rodent hosts were susceptible to RSV infection of the upper airway following intranasal challenge; however, the chinchilla proved to be more permissive than the mouse. The chinchilla model will likely be extremely useful to test the role of RSV in bacterial OM and the efficacy of RSV vaccine candidates designed to provide mucosal and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte immunity. Ultimately, we hope to investigate the relative ability of these candidates to potentially protect against viral <b>predisposal</b> to bacterial OM...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The main {{objective}} of this work was to identify allelic variants of cytokine genes at the polymorphic positions of G- 308 A TNFА, T- 330 G IL- 2, С- 590 Т IL- 4, С- 703 Т IL- 5, and C- 592 A IL- 10, and to assess their contribution to predisposition and resistance of human patients to progression of viral hepatitis C infection. We observed significant increase in frequency of T/G T- 330 G IL- 2 genotype in HCV-infected patients, as compared to healthy individuals. Distribution analysis of C- 590 T promoter alleles of the IL- 4 gene displayed a wide overrepresentation of C/T genotype among HCV-infected patients. Likewise, we have shown the G/A genotype of G- 308 A TNFA to be highly frequent {{in the group of}} HCV-infected patients, whereas this genotype was rare in the sample of healthy persons. When analysing allelic frequencies of cytokine genes at these polymorphic positions, we get an opportunity to predict <b>predisposal</b> for the chronic variant of viral hepatitis C in HCV-infected persons. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract There {{are marked}} {{differentials}} in mortality risks across regions in Finland. No exhaustive explanation to this variation has been provided, however. The {{aim of this}} paper is to analyse how geographic ancestry, as proxied by persons’ birth region and population group, interrelates with cause-specific mortality risks. Focusing on people aged between their mid-thirties and late-forties, we use longi-tudinal population register data that offer opportunities to account for variables that represent both persons ’ social background and their own social status at young adult age. Results of Cox proportional hazard models say that these variables have sub-stantial effects on mortality of different causes, but only a marginal impact on the variation in death rates by birth region and population group. The geographic mortality pattern is found to be specifically prominent for causes of death that are fairly unrelated to persons ’ lifestyles. Our findings suggest that genetic <b>predisposal</b> as expressed in terms of geographic ancestry might play a relevant role in under-standing mortality variation within the population of Finland...|$|E

The radiological signs of infection of the lower bronchial tree can be covered by other lung diseases and these signs can mimic also other lung diseases. A chest X-ray is a first chosen step in radiological imaging in patients suspected of a pulmonary infection. Only when symptoms persist and/or become worse or when the radiological imaging is unclear, a spiral CT or HRCT of the chest will be taken in consideration. The role of medical imaging in pulmonary infection is to determine the presence, localisation and extent of the infection, to detect <b>predisposal</b> factors, to detect complications and in the follow-up of the infection.

40|$|To mimic {{airborne}} immune challenges, layer hens were intratracheally and concurrently challenged {{with various}} {{doses of the}} protein antigen human serum albumin (HuSA) and the pathogen-associated molecular pattern lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at 7 and 13 wk of age. All groups received 1 similar dose of HuSA plus LPS at 11 mo of age. Evaluation of plumage and body condition at 12 mo of age revealed that birds that had undergone intratracheal immunization with a high dosage of HuSA, irrespective of the concurrent dose of LPS, had significantly more feather damage but less wounds to the vent region, as opposed to birds not receiving HuSA. On the other hand, a high dosage of LPS was related to comb damage. These results suggest that stimulation of specific (humoral) immune responses (to HuSA) rather than innate responses (to LPS) {{at a young age}} may predispose layers for feather pecking (FP) behavior at later ages. Involvement of immune mechanisms in FP or vent damage may differ. <b>Predisposal</b> for FP behavior by specific immunity can have consequences for health and vaccine managemen...|$|E

Taking {{into account}} close {{localization}} of genes encoding HSP 70 - 2 and TNFα and mutual influence {{of their products}} upon development of septic process, we investigated allelic polymorphism in the coding region of HSP 70 - 2 gene at position 1267, and a promoter polymorphism of TNFα gene (– 308 position) in sixty-one patients with surgical sepsis, as compared with 100 healthy donors, assuming that certain genomic variants {{can be associated with}} susceptibility for sepsis and/or fatal outcomes in severe sepsis. Significant differences in frequencies of HSP 70 - 2 gene alleles have been found in the group with sepsis against healthy controls. Prevalence of HSP 70 - 2 *B/B allele is increased in the group of patients with sepsis, and a <b>predisposal</b> for sepsis development is shown for carriers of the given genotype.

Exchange of information and research cooperation in resolving identical problems between different institutions contributes towards improving waste-management practices, their efficiency, and general safety. The IAEA Coordinated Research Project (CRP) under the title ’Treatment of Irradiated Graphite to Meet Acceptance Criteria for Waste Disposal’ was conducted during 2010 - 2014 and has involved 24 organisations from ten Member States [1]. The CRP has explored both innovative and conventional methods for graphite characterisation, retrieval, treatment, and conditioning technologies and produced an IAEA technical document [2] which has identified a number of unresolved scientific and technical issues such as the need to: 1. Improve the scientific understanding required on creation, chemical form, location and release behaviour (transport models) of radionuclides; 2. Improve predictive models of radioisotope behaviour; 3. Ensure that sampling programmes are statistically representative of the totality of the graphite to be disposed of; 4. Establish an accurate radionuclide inventory; 5. Consider novel alternative dismantling and treatment strategies. The CRP promoted the exchange of technical information on R & D activities and will facilitate practical application for treatment and conditioning of graphite waste.

Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer׳s Disease (AD), have high prevalence in the elderly population. Early diagnosis {{of this type of}} disease allows early treatment and improves patient quality of life. This paper proposes a Bayesian network decision model for supporting diagnosis of dementia, AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Bayesian networks are well-suited for representing uncertainty and causality, which are both present in clinical domains. The proposed Bayesian network was modeled using a combination of expert knowledge and data-oriented modeling. The network structure was built based on current diagnostic criteria and input from physicians who are experts in this domain. The network parameters were estimated using a supervised learning algorithm from a dataset of real clinical cases. The dataset contains data from patients and normal controls from the Duke University Medical Center (Washington, USA) and the Center for Alzheimer׳s Disease and Related Disorders (at the Institute of Psychiatry of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). The dataset attributes consist of <b>predisposal</b> factors, neuropsychological test results, patient demographic data, symptoms and signs. The decision model was evaluated using quantitative methods and a sensitivity analysis. In conclusion, the proposed Bayesian network showed better results for diagnosis of dementia, AD and MCI when compared to most of the other well-known classifiers.

The pathology shows inflammation with destruction of myelin and axones. I wanted to find out the effects of physical excersise and physiotherapy on MS. Earlier MS patients were advised to avoid excersise, because it was believed to have adverse effects. I searched for litterature in PubMed, using the words “Multiple sclerosis AND effect AND (physiotherapy OR exercise OR physical activity) ” I only included randomized controlled trials. The results showed that many types of excersise can have a positive influence on different aspects of the MS disease. Quality of life, fatigue, walking ability and mobility responded to training. The general function and the ability to manage life on their own was also significant improved. It was hard to prove an improvement in disability.

Still, aggression-related genetic analyses have so far mainly been conducted on small population subsets such as individuals suffering from a certain psychiatric disorder or a narrow-range age cohort, but no data on the general population is yet available. In the present study, {{our aim was to}} identify polymorphisms in genes affecting neurobiological processes that might explain some of the inter-individual variation between aggression levels in the non-clinical Caucasian adult population. 55 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were simultaneously determined in 887 subjects who also filled out the self-report Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ). Single marker association analyses between genotypes and aggression scores indicated a significant role of rs 7322347 located in the HTR 2 A gene encoding serotonin receptor 2 a following Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (p = 0. 0007) both for males and females. Taking the four BPAQ subscales individually, scores for Hostility, Anger and Physical Aggression showed significant association with rs 7322347 T allele in themselves, while no association was found with Verbal Aggression. Of the subscales, relationship with rs 7322347 was strongest in the case of Hostility, where statistical significance virtually equaled that observed with the whole BPAQ. In conclusion, this is the first study to our knowledge analyzing SNPs {{in a wide variety of}} genes in terms of aggression in a large sample-size non-clinical adult population, also describing a novel candidate polymorphism as <b>predisposal</b> to aggressive traits...|$|E

DNA samples were genotyped using PCR-RFLP analysis. IL- 1 β production by PHA-stimulated lymphocytes were determined in the cell supernates by means of quantitative enzyme immunoassay. In majority of patients (> 70 %) with CR, decreased production of IL- 1 β was found, irrespectively of disease recurrence. Frequency of a «low-producer» homozygous *С/*С genotype + 3953 C>Т of IL- 1 β gene was two-fold higher in the patients with CR than in healthy controls (OR= 3. 4). In patients with protracted, recurrence-free patients, this parameter showed only a tendency to increase. Decreased production of IL- 1 β was associated with homozygous *С/*С genotype + 3953 C>Т of IL- 1 β gene (OR = 3, 4), whereas high levels correlated with heterozygous С/*T genotype (OR = 7, 6). Thus, low IL- 1 β production in carriers of homozygous *С/*С of + 3953 polymorphic locus of IL- 1 β gene represents a diagnostic marker reflecting a risk of recurrent disease. Hence, a pathogenesis-based therapy of purulent rhinosinusitis with protracted and recurrent clinical course is possible by means of recombinant IL- 1 β (e. g., Betaleukin, St. Petersburg Institute for Highly Pure Biological Preparations), being a highly effective approach which favors decreased recurrence of disorder...|$|E

The aim of {{present study was to}} compare the dominant oral micro-flora between edentulous denture users with dentate elderly. Material and Method: In current analytical, cross-sectional study, 30 edentulous patients with complete removable denture and 30 dentate subjects, who admitted for non-prosthetic treatments, were randomly selected in Yazd dentistry department. Their oral cavity samples were obtained using sterile cotton-tip swabs, for direct smear analyzing and cultivation on the selective fungal as well as bacterial media. Isolated predominant bacteria and fungi were enumerated and identified by microbiological differential diagnosis tests. Data were analyzed with SPSS software with T test and differences were considered statistically significant when p< 0. 05. Results: The non-aureus staphylococcus and alpha-hemolytic streptococci showed the highest positive culture among the isolated microorganisms in both groups, whereas beta hemolytic streptococci showed the least percent of isolated microorganism in both groups. The higher density of non-aureus Staphylococci, α-hemolitic Streptococci, Gram negative cocobasillus, non-pathogenic Neisseria, Candida and Corynebacterium were recovered from oral samples of denture users in compare with dentate subjects (P= 0. 0001). There was also seen a statistical significant correlation between the number of isolated microorganisms and the duration of denture utilization in denture users (P= 0. 013).

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Composting is one of the techniques that has evolved as a safe disposal and <b>predisposal</b> alternative to the stringent regulations on hazardous waste disposal. The implementation of this technique needs careful evaluation of the processes a hazardous compound undergoes when subjected to composting. The purpose of this thesis is to define these processes and develop a model for determining the fate of organic compounds in waste during in-vessel composting Volatilization and biodegradation are found to be the major fate determining processes. Following mass balance approach the compound's loss through these processes is evaluated by developing a fate model. Fate of six aromatic compounds which fall into three categories-volatile, semi-volatile, and non volatile, is determined and the results compared to the experimental values for validating the model. A sensitivity analysis has been performed to determine which parameters most influence the model behavior and quantitatively describe their effects on model performance. The results obtained from the model show close agreement with the experimental results. More data is required to quantify the slight differences observed. The volatilization loss is found to exist only for first few hours. Biodegradation rates are found to have very little impact on volatilization of the compound. Air flow rate and volume of the waste are found to have a noticeable effect on the volatilization of a compound. Bulk density is found to effect volatilization to a small extent. Air quality control measures are recommended for the first few days to deal with the volatilized gases...|$|E
40|$|This review {{presents}} our own {{and literature}} data dedicated to predisposing and pathogenetic factors involved in development of a common comorbidity, diabetes-associated osteoarthritis (DAOA). So far, there is no wide-accepted clinical or scientific viewing of DAOA as a distinct clinical phenotype of osteoarthritis (OA). To our knowledge, the role of genetic factors in DAOA development was not discussed in details. Therefore, we have drawn attention to the cross-acting genes involved in both OA and diabetes, i. e., PPARγ, FTO, ADIPOQ, and AGE. These genes encode proteins which {{can contribute to the}} pathogenesis of both OA and diabetes. However, some controversies exist about genetic <b>predisposal</b> for OA and diabetes. We review the studies which concern various clinical characteristics of DAOA. We describe a role of chronic hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, advanced glycation end-products (AGE) in development of OA and micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes. The mechanisms of low-grade inflammation, humoral and cellular immune responses to cartilage antigens, and their role in OA progression are discussed. We underline a similarity of low-grade inflammation in OA and microvascular complications in diabetes. In conclusion, OA and diabetes comorbidity is not a mere coincidence of these diseases. They share some common genetic and pathogenetic factors, a distinct phenotype, and may change thinking of physicians and scientists towards a holistic (personalized) approach to prevention, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of this comorbidity. We discuss opportunities of DAOA pharmacotherapy based on the key comorbidity feature, i. e., emergence of a new disease property by coexistence of several diseases. One may hypothesize that studying genetic, molecular, and cellular networks in comorbidities may lead to new treatment strategies (‘network pharmacology”) based on targeting the network hubs. We provide examples of such approach in some polypathies (e. g., phenofibrate, a PPARα agonist; simvastatin, a GMGCoA reductase in OA, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis), and its potential discuss usefulness is discussed for DAOA. In particular, we provide an example of a pilot study of ademethionine, a methyl group donator...|$|E

Deterioration of socio-economic conditions in the population complicates epidemic situation for tuberculosis inRussia, thus leading to increase in acute progressive and complicated forms of tuberculosis in children and, consequently, to worsening structure of its clinical forms. Objectives: to determine associations between certain HLA-DRB 1 alleles and risk of tuberculosis development in children. We examined 188 children aged from 3 to 14 years with various manifestations of tuberculous infection. Along with thorough examination of the patients, including multi-spiral CT scans of chest, we undertook genotyping of HLA-DRB 1 alleles. Activity of tuberculous infection was determined {{by a set of}} immunological tests, i. e., tuberculin skin test, DIASKINTEST® (recombinant allergen of tuberculosis DIASKINTEST®). X ray diagnostics was performed with multi-spiral «Aquilion- 32 » computed tomograph (Toshiba), according to standard procedures. Molecular genetic typing of HLA-DRB 1 alleles was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR-SSP), using standard commercial kits PROTRANS Ceclerplate System Protrans HLA-DRB 1 *. The children were divided into two groups: I group, 90 healthy children, II group, 98 children with tuberculosis. A comparisons group consisted of healthy donors (n = 346). Statistical processing of genetic material included evauation and analysis of the following parameters: frequency distribution of the antigen (F), χ 2 criterion for significance (chi-square), the relative risk ratio (RR), etiologic fraction (EF), preventive fraction (PF). Children of the II group had significantly higher * 04 allele HLADRB 1 *, as compared with control group (36. 7 % vs. 21. 1 %, χ 2 = 10. 08; р < 0. 01). This finding may suppose a <b>predisposal</b> of these allele carriers to development of tuberculosis. At the same time, the rates of * 07 (14. 3 % vs. 27. 5 %, χ 2 = 7. 15, р < 0. 01) and * 15 (18. 4 % vs. 28. 3 %, χ 2 = 3. 92; р < 0. 01) HLA-DRB 1 * alleles were significantly lower, thus suggesting a protective effect of this allele. * 04 allele seems to be a predisposing factor, whereas * 07 and * 15 alleles are protective for development of tuberculosis in children.  </p...|$|E
40|$|Anterior {{cruciate}} ligament (ACL) injuries {{are one of}} the most common injuries involving lower extremities among athletes. Due to the severity of the injury and the invasive procedure in reconstructing the ligament, ACL injuries can have a significant impact on muscular strength, flexibility, and endurance. The purpose of this study was to examine differences in ground reaction force (GRF) between lower extremities of subjects who have undergone unilateral ACL reconstructive surgery. Of particular interest is the subjects’ <b>predisposal</b> to future injuries resulting from significant disparities of produced forces between lower extremities and, consequently, the resulting disruption of the body’s kinetic chain. Ten collegiate athletes (n= 10) were used for the study: Five having undergone no prior surgery involving lower extremities (control group) and five having undergone unilateral ACL reconstructive surgery (experimental group). Tests were conducted in the Biomechanics’ Laboratory using the force plate to measure GRF (Newtons). Each subject completed a total of 10 vertical jumps: Five jumps were completed with only one leg on the force plate for measurement (GRF), and then five jumps were completed with only the opposite leg on the force plate for measurement (GRF). For the experimental group, the reconstructed leg was tested first, ruling out fatigue as a contributor for the expected decreased force production. Upon completion, subject’s jumps were averaged and combined with their respective groups. A grand mean then was calculated for each group and used for discussion of results. Obtained data exhibited significant differences of force produced between surgically repaired and non-surgically repaired extremities. For the control group, differences were minimal on both the upward and downward phase of the jump, with an average disparity of 5 percent and 7 percent, respectively. For the experimental group, however, the non-reconstructed extremity demonstrated significantly more force on both the upward and downward phase of the jump, with an average disparity of 130 percent and 140 percent, respectively. It can be assumed these imbalances are not only occurring during explosive movements such as the vertical jump; yet, they occur during everyday activities such as walking, standing, sitting, etc. When dealing with such imbalances, the body makes compensatory changes that disrupt the body’s kinetic chain. Over time, these disruptions can manifest into chronic injuries resulting from muscular strength and flexibility imbalances, improper movement patterns, and postural deviations—not to mention, the probability of a traumatic injury also is greatly increased due to the aforementioned problems...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this model report is to develop the summary {{cladding}} degradation abstraction {{that will be used}} in the Total System Performance Assessment for the License Application (TSPA-LA). Most civilian commercial nuclear fuel is encased in Zircaloy cladding. The model addressed in this report is intended to describe the postulated condition of commercial Zircaloy-clad fuel as a function of postclosure time after it is placed in the repository. Earlier total system performance assessments analyzed the waste form as exposed UO{sub 2 }, which was available for degradation at the intrinsic dissolution rate. Water in the waste package quickly became saturated with many of the radionuclides, limiting their release rate. In the total system performance assessments for the Viability Assessment and the Site Recommendation, cladding was analyzed as part of the waste form, limiting the amount of fuel available at any time for degradation. The current model is divided into two stages. The first considers <b>predisposal</b> rod failures (most of which occur during reactor operation and associated activities) and postdisposal mechanical failure (from static loading of rocks) as mechanisms for perforating the cladding. Other fuel failure mechanisms including those caused by handling or transportation have been screened out (excluded) or are treated elsewhere. All stainless-steel-clad fuel, which makes up {{a small percentage of the}} overall amount of fuel to be stored, is modeled as failed upon placement in the waste packages. The second stage of the degradation model is the splitting of the cladding from the reaction of water or moist air and UO{sub 2 }. The splitting has been observed to be rapid in comparison to the total system performance assessment time steps and is modeled to be instantaneous. After the cladding splits, the rind buildup inside the cladding widens the split, increasing the diffusion area from the fuel rind to the waste package interior. This model report summarizes the component models, developed for the two stages noted above, that are used as inputs to TSPA-LA. The model concludes that less than two percent of the fuel, including all of the stainless-steel clad fuel, received at the repository is failed (perforated) upon receipt at the repository. All failed fuel is assumed to axially split upon waste package failure exposing the fuel to oxidation from the in-package environment. TSPA-LA then calculates the release of radionuclides from the exposed volume of oxidized fuel...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{hemoglobin}} (Hb) superfamily, {{an unusual}} group called hexacoordinate hemoglobin (hxHbs) {{whose members are}} found in all living organisms {{is the subject of}} exciting studies since their discovery. They are named 2 ̆ 2 hexacoordinate 2 ̆ 2 because of reversible coordination of the sixth coordination site of the heme iron by a histidine side chain located in the heme distal pocket. Interestingly, hxHbs share high degree of similarity in their primary sequence and a common globin fold indicating that they might share a common role and that endogenous coordination might be an important part of their not yet characterized physiological function. The characterization of their ligand binding mechanism and their biochemical activity are the first steps toward the understanding of their function.;Using flash photolysis and rapid mixing methods, we measured the CO binding reactions for human, plant and bacterial hxHbs. The results obtained using our new model demonstrate that hexacoordination regulates, at different degree, the affinity constants for ligand binding. Plant hxHbs contain a conserved Phe at position 2 ̆ 2 B 102 ̆ 2 (PheB 10) that is near the reversibly coordinated distal HisE 7. We have investigated the effects of PheB 10 mutation on kinetic and equilibrium constants for hexacoordination and exogenous ligand binding in the ferrous and ferric oxidation states. Our analyses reveal that PheB 10 is a key regulatory element in hexacoordination.;Phylogenetically, plant hxHbs are group into two different classes: class 1 and class 2. No reports comparing the oxygen affinity of plant hxHbs from different class are available. Therefore, we have determined all the components necessary to determine v accurately the oxygen affinity for class 1 and 2 hxHbs. Our results are the first evidence, that each class of plant hxHbs might have different functions in their respective environment.;Despite considerable attention to these hxHbs, no clear physiological role(s) has been assigned to them in any species. One popular and relevant hypothesis for their function is NO dioxygenation. Therefore, we have tested different hxHbs for their abilities to scavenge NO. Based on in vitro analysis, we conclude that there is no characteristic that distinguishes hxHbs from other Hbs that could support their <b>predisposal</b> toward a role in NO scavenging. However, when comparing their ability to substitute for flavoHb (a known NO scavenger) in E. coli, Synechocystis hemoglobin is the only one to confer protection from NO in vivo while the other hxHbs and myoglobin fail in this function. The role of the Cys E 16 in plant hxHbs was also investigated as in human hemoglobin, the corresponding residus is involved in NO transport. Our results show clearly that CysE 16 is not crucial for the NO dioxygenation activity but regulates reversible histidine hexacoordination.;In conclusion, the biophysical and biochemical characterization of several hxHbs presented here is an important contribution towards the understanding of hxHbs physiological function...|$|E
40|$|Lysine demethylases are a newly {{discovered}} group of enzymes that have rapidly expanded over evolutionary {{time by the}} acquisition of multiple functional domains, {{in addition to the}} unifying catalytic JmjC domain. There are thirty members of the JmjC-domain family in humans. A proportion of lysine demethylases catalyse the removal of methyl modifications from lysine residues of histones and non-histone proteins. The discovery of mutations in histone demethylase genes, in a number of human syndromes, stresses the functional importance of these enzymes in development and disease. Therefore, the phenotypic dissection of animal models of histone lysine demethylases will provide invaluable insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie human disease. In mammals, the Kdm 3 family of histone demethylases includes Kdm 3 a, Kdm 3 b, Jmjd 1 c and Hairless. However, in zebrafish, there are two kdm 3 genes, one of which encodes a protein similar to both the mammalian Kdm 3 a and Kdm 3 b. Morpholino knock-down of the kdm 3 gene in zebrafish faithfully recapitulates classical ciliary phenotypes, although the underlying causalities are still unclear. In recent years, Kdm 3 a function has been extensively dissected through the use of mouse models and cell culture studies, focusing on the nuclear histone demethylation function. Kdm 3 a gene-trap and knock-out mouse models present with obesity, infertility, sex reversal and <b>predisposal</b> to diabetes, reminiscent of a human ciliopathy syndrome. No mouse models for Kdm 3 b have been characterised yet. In this study, I hypothesized that the murine Kdm 3 a and Kdm 3 b histone demethylases have diverged biological roles and that the zebrafish kdm 3 fulfils the functions of both. The aims of my thesis were: 1) to compare the evolutionary conservation of the zebrafish kdm 3 and murine Kdm 3 b in function and check their spatial expression, 2) to dissect the phenotype of Kdm 3 b gene-trapped mice and 3) to characterise an alternative murine Kdm 3 a isoform. Protein sequence comparison studies show that the zebrafish kdm 3 protein is closer in sequence to the mammalian Kdm 3 b. Both the zebrafish kdm 3 and murine Kdm 3 b are di-methyl lysine 9 (H 3 K 9 me 2) demethylases, however, they have diverged spatial expression during embryogenesis. In agreement with the phenotype of kdm 3 morphants, over-expression of the zebrafish kdm 3 reduces ciliation efficiency when transfected into animal cells. Notably, the phenotype analysis of Kdm 3 b gene-trapped mice does not resemble classical ciliary phenotypes, as one would expect from the zebrafish data. Homozygous Kdm 3 b gene-trapped mice are postnatally growth retarded, with plausible defects in thymus organ development. Interestingly, an alternative murine Kdm 3 a isoform (Kdm 3 a-i 2) shows both nuclear and cytoplasmic localisation. Over-expression studies revealed that Kdm 3 ai 2 retains its histone demethylation function, and a proportion of the over-expressed construct localises to the centrosome. In addition, over-expression of Kdm 3 a-i 2 reduces ciliation efficiency. Overall, the data from my studies suggests that: 1) the zebrafish kdm 3 is more similar in sequence to the murine Kdm 3 b than Kdm 3 a, is a histone demethylase and has a distinct spatial expression during embryogenesis. However, the phenotype of kdm 3 zebrafish morphants is more closely related to the Kdm 3 a-than Kdm 3 bdeficient mice, 2) the murine Kdm 3 a and Kdm 3 b have distinct biological roles, as evidenced by the mouse models, 3) the Kdm 3 a-i 2 isoform shares the same nuclear demethylation function as the full length Kdm 3 a and has a plausible centrosomal function...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of alumina from bauxite by the Bayer process generates a {{large volume of}} residue (red mud). This residue contains a percentage of complex zeolitic sodium aluminium silicates, formed by the precipitation of silica from the Bayer liquor and are known as the desilication product or DSP. The presence of DSP in red mud contributes significantly to making the residue highly alkaline and high in sodium and therefore a potential environmental hazard upon disposal. This thesis documents {{the findings of a}} study with the objective of examining the nature and behaviour of a DSP-type mineral, determining its stability, including {{the way in which the}} release of sodium occurs and the potential for cation exchange. By so doing, a clearer picture of the DSP in red mud and its reaction to environmental factors, such as the pH of water percolating through the red mud disposal sites, was sought. An insight into the possibility of <b>predisposal</b> treatments, such as mixing the mud with acid waste or with material that would induce a favourable cation exchange was similarly gained. A laboratory-synthesised DSP mineral was used in these studies, because of the difficulty of working with red mud, in which DSP is cloaked with other residue minerals. The similarity of various synthetic DSPs (including the synthetic material used for this work) to that found in red mud was examined. It was found that the DSP formed at Alcoa's Kwinana plant (Western Australia) was a composite of the minerals noselite/nosean and sodalite, with sulphate being the main anion incorporated into the DSP. The synthetic mineral used in the study was therefore a mixture of the three aforementioned minerals. The sensitivity of synthetic and non-synthetic DSP to the citrate-bicarbonate-dithionite CBD method, used in leaching away the iron oxide that masks the DSP in red mud was examined. No significant effect on the DSP after leaching by CBD was observable. This confirmed that studies of DSP in red mud after removal of iron oxides by the CBD method were valid. In the study of DSP stability, its behaviour at various levels of acidity and alkalinity was noted, to determine under what disposal conditions the potentially harmful release of sodium is most likely to occur and to provide information relevant to acid-waste treatment of red mud before or at disposal. Synthetic DSP samples were subjected to a range of pH conditions, from very alkaline to very acidic, over a range of time periods up to three weeks duration. The results of these tests indicated that DSP is stable to pHs as low as 8. 5, with no significant release of sodium to the environment after 3 weeks. The study of cation exchange behaviour in DSP was undertaken to determine if exchanging sodium (which is toxic to plants) for some likely cations such as potassium or ammonium (plant nutrients) may feasibly be used to rehabilitate red mud, since zeolitic minerals like those in DSPs are noted for their ion exchange properties. The exchange of sodium from within synthetic DSP for potassium, ammonium and calcium ions was investigated. It was concluded that the cubic crystal habit of the DSP examined restricted the exchange of sodium ions with cations such as calcium, but allowed other cations (particularly potassium) to penetrate and replace up to 30...|$|E
40|$|This Addendum supplements, and to {{some extent}} replaces, the {{preliminary}} description of environmental radiological surveillance programs for low-level waste burial grounds (LLWBG) used in the parent document, 11 Technology, Safety and Costs of DecolliTlissioning a Reference Low-Level Waste Burial Ground, 11 NUREG/ CR- 0570. The Addendum provides additional detail and rationale for the environmental radiological surveillance programs for the two referenced sites and inventories described in NUREG/CR- 0570. The rationale and performance criteria herein are expected to be useful in providing guidance for determining the acceptability of environmental surveillance programs for other inventories and other LLWBG sites. Two generic burial grounds, one located on an arid western site and the other located on a humid eastern site, are reference facilities considered in this Addendum, and as described in the parent document (NUREG/CR- 0570). The two sites are assumed to have the same capacity for waste, the same radioactive waste inventory, and similar trench characteristics and operating procedures. The climate, geology, and hydrology of the two reference sites are typical of existing western and eastern sites, altnough a single population distribution was chosen for both. Each reference burial ground occupies about 70 hectares and includes 180 trenches filled with a total of 1. 5 x 10 {sup 6 } m{sup 3 } of radioactive waste. In acldition, there are 10 slit trenches containing about 1. 5 x 10 {sup 3 } m{sup 3 } of high beta-gamma activity waste. In this Addendum environmental surveillance programs are described for the several periods {{in the life of a}} LLWBG: preoperational (prior to nuclear waste receipt); operational (including interim trench closures); post-operational (after all nuclear waste is received), for both short-term {up to three years) and long-term (up to 100 years) storage and custodial care; and decommissioning (only for the special case of waste removal). The specific environmental monitoring requirements for final site characterization and certification surveys are beyond the scope of this Addendum. Data collection associated with site reconnaissance and preselection is not specifically addressed, but it is recognized that such data may be useful in designing the preoperational program. <b>Predisposal</b> control measures, quality assurance, and record-keeping (other than inventory records) associated with waste disposal operations are also not addressed. The primary intent of routine environmental surveillance at a LLWBG is to help ensure that site activities do not cause significant transport of radioactivity from the site, resulting in an unacceptable health hazard to people. Preoperational environmental surveillance serves to determine for later comparison the background radioactivity levels, either naturally occurring or the result of man&#x 27;s activities (e. g. world-wide fallout or an adjacent nuclear facility), in and around the proposed burial ground site. The operational environmental surveillance program is used to estimate radiological conditions, both onsite and offsite as a possible result of burial ground activities, including trench closure(s). These data help to determine LLWBG compliance with regulatory requirements. During the post-operational period environmental surveillance should normally be an extension of the program carried out during operations, with appropriate deletions (or modifications) to account for the differences between operational and post-operational activities at the site. During the long-term storage and custodial care period, environmental surveillance serves to verify the radionuclide confinement capability of the burial ground and to identify problem situations requiring remedial action. For waste removal (exhumation), the environmental surveillance program is again modified to account for the greatly increased potential for direct radiation and contamination spread. At the time of decommissioning, "environmental surveillance" takes on a new meaning, from that of an ongoing program to one of site "characterization" and dose assessment, requiring more rigorous statistical design and testing than described for the other surveillance periods at a LLWBG. The environmental surveillance programs suggested in this Addendum are based on the radionuclide inventories given in Section 7 of NUREG/CR- 0570 and the potential critical pathways determined for the reference sites. The Addendum suggests the use of exposure pathway analysis to evaluate the potential critical pathways to man from radionuclides in the waste. Hence, the monitoring programs recommended for the two reference sites include those nuclide/media resulting in the highest potential radiation dose or those in which the greatest buildup of contaminants can be expected. Appropriate use is made of existing regulations and other published reports and guides on the subject of environmental surveillance...|$|E
40|$|Necrotic {{enteritis}} (NE) {{is described}} as a disease of high economical impact which affects health and welfare of broilers and may also pose a threat to public health. Therefore any predisposing factor to NE is regarded very important. The effect of stress factors attributed to management practices such as feed deprivation, high stocking density, heat stress, cold stress and vaccination with live attenuated anticoccidial vaccine on the pathogenesis of NE has not been studied adequately. Therefore, the objective {{of the present study was}} to validate the effect of the above mentioned management stressors on the pathogenesis of NE by the use of an effective experimental model. For this purpose five experiments were carried out. In each one of the four experiments 240 day old broiler chicks (Cobb 500) were randomly allocated into four experimental groups of 60 broilers each, while in the fifth experiment for the evaluation of vaccination with live attenuated anticoccidial vaccine on the pathogenesis of NE, 300 day old broilers chicken were randomly allocated into five experimental groups of 60 broilers each. Each experimental group consisted of two replicates (subgroups). The experimental period for each experiment was set to 24 days. On day 16, 21, 22, 23 and 24, six birds per subgroup were euthanized. The examinations conducted at each sampling day included the gross lesion scoring of intestine, gizzard and liver, the histopathology of intestine and liver, the flotation of feces, the microscopic examination of wet smears from intestinal mucosa and content, the measurement of pH of intestinal content, the measurement of viscosity of contents of jejunum and ileum, the bacterial cultivation of C. perfringens from liver and swab samples of gizzard, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum and the quantification of C. perfringens in cecum. Moreover, broilers were weighed on day 1, 9, 16, 17 and 21, while feed conversion ratio was calculated for the periods of 10 - 16 days of age and 17 - 21 days of age. In order to reproduce the NE, an experimental challenge model using C. perfringens and tenfold dose of a live anticoccidial vaccine was adopted. Experimentally challenged birds were orally infected three times per day with 4 x 108 cfu C. perfringens for four consecutive days (days 17, 18 19 and 20). The used strain was resistant to rifampicin. For the induction of NE, at day 18 birds were also inoculated orally with tenfold dose of a live anticoccidial vaccine (Paracox TM- 5) which consisted of oocysts of E. acervulina, E. maxima, E. mitis and E. tenella. Broilers in all groups were fed a specially formulated three phase ratio (starter 1 - 9 d, grower 10 - 16 d and finisher 17 - 24 d), which included large quantities of wheat, rye and soya. In the finisher ration soya was replaced by fishmeal which acted as predisposing factor of NE. The use of antibiotic growth promoters and anticoccidial drugs was avoided. The aim of the first experiment was to investigate the effect of feed deprivation on the pathogenesis of NE in broiler chickens. The treatment groups used in this experiment were group N served as negative control, group SN where feed deprivation was applied, group P where birds were experimentally challenged with C. perfringens and tenfold dose of a live attenuated anticoccidial vaccine and group SP where birds were both experimentally challenged and suffered starvation. In groups where feed deprivation was applied, the feed was withdrawn at days 16, 17, 18 and 19 for 12 hours daily starting from 21 : 00 to 09 : 00. The results of the experiment demonstrated that starvation has a significant protective effect against the experimentally induced NE in broilers, by limiting the C. perfringens caeca counts and reducing the severity of the NE lesions. The objective of second experiment was to assess the influence of high stocking density as a predisposing factor in NE in broiler chickens. The treatment groups used in this experiment were control group N where birds were at normal stocking density (15 birds/m 2) and not challenged, group DN where birds were raised at 50 % increased stocking density from 1 st day (30 birds/m 2), group P where birds were raised at standard stocking density and challenged with C. perfringens and with tenfold dose of a live attenuated anticoccidial vaccine and group DP where birds were challenged and raised at increased stocking density as described above. The experiment provides evidence that high stocking density increased the frequency and severity of NE. The purpose of third experiment was to investigate the effects of heat stress on the pathogenesis of NE in broiler chickens. The treatment groups used in this experiment were group N served as negative control, group HN where heat stress (35 oC) was applied, group P where birds were experimentally challenged with C. perfringens and with tenfold dose of a live attenuated anticoccidial vaccine, and group HP where birds were both experimentally challenged and suffered heat stress. In groups where heat stress was applied, temperature was increased from 25 νC (the recommended temperature for broilers at the respective age) to 35 νC at days 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 for 12 hours daily starting from 21 : 00 to 09 : 00 h. Heat stress predisposes broilers to the manifestation of NE, because it provokes the occurrence of NE lesions in non challenged birds and also caused further increase of the severity of lesions in challenged birds. The objective of fourth experiment was to assess the influence of cold stress on the pathogenesis of NE in broiler chickens. The treatment groups used in this experiment were group N served as negative control, group CN where cold stress (15 oC) was applied, group P where birds were experimentally challenged with C. perfringens and tenfold dose of a live attenuated anticoccidial vaccine and group CP where birds were both experimentally challenged and suffered cold stress as described above. In groups where cold stress was applied, temperature was decreased from 25 νC (the recommended temperature for broilers at the respective age) to 15 νC at days 17, 18, 19 and 20 for 12 hours daily starting from 9 : 00 to 21 : 00. The experiment provides evidence that cold stress increased severity of subclinical NE. The objective of fifth experiment was to assess the influence of live anticoccidial vaccine on the pathogenesis of NE in broiler chickens and to establish a more efficient experimental model for the reproduction of NE. The treatment groups used in this experiment were group N served as negative control, group PN where birds vaccinated at day 1 with live attenuated anticoccidial vaccine, group P where birds were experimentally challenged with C. perfringens and tenfold dose of a live attenuated anticoccidial vaccine, group M where birds were challenged with C. perfringens and E. maxima and group PM where birds vaccinated at day 1 and were challenged with C. perfringens and E. maxima. The study provides evidence that live anticoccidial vaccine decreased the frequency and severity of experimental NE. Furthermore, the challenge of birds with C. perfringens and E. maxima increased the frequency and aggregated the severity of NE lesions compared to challenge with C. perfringens and tenfold dose of a live anticoccidial vaccine. It is evident from our studies that among the management factors in intensive broiler production systems, high stocking density, heat stress and cold stress pose a significant <b>predisposal</b> role for the induction of NE, while feed deprivation and vaccination against coccidiosis act protectively against it. ...|$|E
40|$|Empirische Forschungsbeiträge zur möglichen Prädisposition einer Sekten-/ Kultmitgliedschaft sind {{international}} kaum vorhanden. Die vorhandenen Beobachtungen, Erfahrungen und Aussagen zu diesem Thema sind zwar sehr zahlreich, oft aber auch sehr widersprüchlich. So behaupten z. B. die einen, daß Kultmitglieder vermehrt aus dysfunktionalen Familien kommen würden oder daß eine Psychopathologie vor dem Beitritt vorlag. Im Gegensatz dazu sind andere der Meinung, daß Kultmitglieder aus ganz normalen, funktionierenden und behütenden Familien stammen und daß keineswegs eine Psychopathologie vorlag. Durch die hier vorliegende Arbeit sollte eruiert werden, ob es so etwas wie eine Beitrittsdisposition nun tatsächlich gibt und wenn ja - welche Faktoren dafür verantwortlich sein könnten. Alle Daten der hier durchgeführten Untersuchung stammten von Familien, die sich mit der Bitte um Beratung an den Autor wandten, weil jeweils ein oder mehrere Angehörige sich zu einem Kultbeitritt entschlossen hatten. Die Basis dieser Untersuchung stellte ein halbstandardisierter, anamnestischer Fragebogen dar, der jeweils vor der ersten persönlichen Begegnung an die betroffenen Familien, Ehepartner und/oder Freunde geschickt wurde. Ziel dieses Fragebogens war, möglichst ausführliche Informationen über die Biograpie des Kultmitglieds zu erhalten, um eine effektive Beratung durchführen zu können. Es handelte sich also um Fremdbeurteilungen in Form einer schriftlichen Befragung. Die so zustande gekommenen quantitativen und qualitativen Daten bezogen sich auf insgesamt 110 Pbn im Alter von 12 bis 50 Jahren. Dies ist -zumindest für die BRD - die bisher größte Stichprobe zu diesem Thema. Die Ergebnisse dieser Studie machen u. a. deutlich, daß sich Menschen mit entsprechender Lebensgeschichte vermehrt auch bestimmten Kultkategorien anschließen. Zum Teil liegen prädisponierende Faktoren für einen Kultbeitritt vor. Allerdings wird auch deutlich, daß der Grund für einen Beitritt nicht auf nur einige wenige, prägnante Faktoren zurückzuführen ist, sondern daß jeder Kultbeitritt als multikausales Gefüge verstanden werden sollte. So konnte nachgewiesen werden, daß die Mehrzahl der Personen unmittelbar vor ihrem Beitritt mehrere zeitgleiche und scheinbar unlösbare Probleme zu bewältigen hatten (z. B. innerhalb der Familie, in ihrer Beziehung, in der Schule und/oder im Beruf). Dem dadurch vermehrt vorhandenen Belastungsdruck in den verschiedenen Lebensbereichen - und der subjektiven Valenz, die diesen Begebenheiten zugeschrieben wurde - begegneten diese Personen mit einem Kultbeitritt, der vordergründig sicherlich Erleichterung versprach. The {{contribution to}} empirical research {{of a possible}} predisposition for cult involvement is rarely available on an international scale. The current observations, experiences and statements made to this theme are indeed countless but are also often extremely inconsistent. So it is claimed, for example, that many cult members come from dysfunctional families or that a psychopathological disorder was already existent before joining a cult. In opposition to this include those who hold the opinion that cult members come from completely normal, functional and protective families who clearly have no history of psychopathological illness. The proposed work should be ascertained whether such a disposition to joining a cult actually exists and if so, which factors could be responsible. All the data of conducted inquiries {{included in this study}} were derived from families who consulted the author for advice because one or more of their family members decided to join a cult. The basis of this inquiry represented a semi-standardised questionnaire of case histories which was sent to the affected families, partners and/or friends before the initial consultation. Hence, the questionnaire was an external assessment {{in the form of a}} written examination. It managed to achieve the quantitative and qualitative data of a sample of 110 cult members aged between 12 and 50 years. This is (at least for the Federal Republic of Germany) the largest sample ever conducted in relation to this theme. The following focal points should be thoroughly examined: The family background and the personality of the cult members, as well as the situational conditions and the psychological state just prior to joining the cult. The most significant results are as follows: ?	The majority of persons, who were single before joining the cult, came from either middle-class or upper-middle-class families and were aged between 21 and 25 years. In addition, they were raised with several brothers and sisters in small provinces and rural towns (astonishingly, from the total amount surveyed, only 3 individuals were without siblings). The standard of education was comparatively high. Most of the parents were married. ?	The majority of persons suffered simultaneously from several burdening experiences before joining a cult. Further, most of them experienced a dysfunctional family background and were confronted with difficult life situations (critical life events) immediately prior to joining a cult. ?	Only a small amount of persons indicated a psychopathological disorder. ?	Approximately half of those surveyed were discribed as being altruistic, sensitive and lonely. Only a quarter of those surveyed were found to be naive, unstable, introverted, idealistic and/or denoted a lack of self-awareness. ?	According to slightly more than half of the cult members (after individual statments were made), the decisive factor for joining a cult was the desire for a binding doctrine. Only a small amount regarded self-realisation or discontentment as a motive for joining. ?	Specific differences in gender could be proven. An increasing number of female cult members came from small towns and Protestant families who rarely attended church. These women viewed their family situation as incriminatory and the communication as restrictive. While the women were more dissatisfied with their life circumstances, the male cult members were described as being increasingly introverted. Furthermore, the male members were more interested in the doctrine/ideology of the respective grouping. ?	Further, it succeeded by presenting a profile of 3 cult categories: Christian-Fundamentalist groups, Guru Movements and Psycho-Cult/Esoteric Movements. In the following, the profile of these 3 cult categories shall be presented in more detail. Those who joined a Christian-Fundamentalistic cult, were mainly aged between 21 and 25 years. A majority reported to have attended church on a regular basis and were reared in families who showed a lack of communicative competence. Further, they often regarded a sense of community, a binding doctrine and the search for a meaningful life as being significant reasons for joining. 	Those who joined the Guru Movements, were aged between 16 and 20 years. A majority of these members were men and first-born children who mainly attended secondary school without having completed their matriculation. Regular church attendance took place. Fewer persons were reported to have experienced incriminatory family situations whilst more claimed to have experienced competent communication within the family. They were considered as being neither altruistic nor depressive, but rather introverted. Further, they claimed to be searching more for a binding doctrine and less for a meaningful life. The members of the alleged Psycho-Cults and Esoteric Movements entered these groups at a notably older age, between 26 and 30 years. These movements were predominately made up of female members who rarely attended church and came from split families. Further, they experienced increasingly burdening family situations and suffered from problems relating to work or school immediately before joining a cult. They were not regarded as being introverted but were described as having egoistic personalities. In addition, they considered that neither the search for community nor the need for a binding doctrine were relevant means for joining a cult. These results helped to gain an initial insight into a largely unsearched area. Furthermore, they contributed towards the clarification of the specific biographical and thematic backgrounds which may suggest a <b>predisposal</b> to cult membership. This examination has clearly demonstrated the complexity involved in joining a cult and should therefore be taken into consideration when working with ex-cult/cult members and their relatives. Both sides should be given equal consideration - not only the cult (referred to as, The Lock´) and its internal dynamics, but also to the person (referred to as, The Key´) and his/her individual needs. The results of this study clearly suggest, among other factors, that persons with similiar life histories are increasingly confined to specific cult categories. Some pre-disposed factors are responsible for joining a cult. However, it also becomes clear that the reason for joining a cult is not purely generated by a few concise factors but rather by multiple causes. It could be proven that the majority of persons had to simultaneously cope with several and unsolved problems immediately before they joined a cult. For instance, within their family, their relationships, at school and/or at work. Because of the increasing existing pressures in the various areas of life, and because of the subjective valency which was ascribed to these occurrences, the persons involved in this report were joining cults which were undoubtedly promising solutions and a sense of superficial relief...|$|E
40|$|Executive summary Introduction The Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management {{and on the}} Safety of Radioactive Waste Management {{was adopted}} on 29 September 1997 at the Vienna Diplomatic Conference. Finland signed the Convention on 2 October 1997 and {{deposited}} the tools of acceptance on 10 February 2000. The Convention entered into force on 18 June 2001. This report is the 6 th Finnish National Report under the Joint Convention {{in accordance with the}} provisions of Article 32. It will be subject to review in May 2018 in the sixth Review Meeting of the contracting parties in Vienna. The fulfilment of the obligations of the Convention and the development of waste management after the Fifth Review Meeting, during the reporting period 2014 – 2016, are assessed in this report. There are currently two nuclear power plants operating in Finland: Loviisa and Olkiluoto plants. The Loviisa plant comprises two VVER- 440 units (Russian type pressurised water reactors), operated by Fortum Power and Heat Oy (FPH). The Olkiluoto plant comprises two BWR units (boiling water reactors); operated by Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO) and a third PWR (pressurized water reactor) unit is under construction. In addition, Fennovoima Oy (Fennovoima) has applied for a construction licence for one pressurised water reactor (AES- 2006) at Pyhäjoki. Spent fuel from the nuclear power plant units is stored in interim pool type storages at the power plant sites for tens of years until disposal. The interim spent fuel storages have already been in operation for about 30 years. The safety of the interim storages was enhanced during the reporting period. The spent nuclear fuel disposal project has progressed as planned. The construction licence for the encapsulation and disposal facility was granted by the Government to Posiva in November 2015 and the construction of the geological disposal facility started in Olkiluoto in December 2016. Fennovoima started the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of its own spent nuclear fuel disposal in summer 2016. Geological disposal facilities for low and intermediate level waste have been in operation since the 1990 s in Olkiluoto and Loviisa. In the future, the Olkiluoto facility is planned to be extended for operational waste from the OL 3 unit and decommissioning waste from all reactor units in Olkiluoto. The disposal facility in Loviisa will be extended for decommissioning waste from the Loviisa NPP units. Fennovoima has planned to build a geological disposal facility for its low and intermediate level waste at the Pyhäjoki site. Major developments in Finland since the 5 th Review Meeting are as follows: there has been real progress in spent nuclear fuel disposal, as well as the enhancement of spent fuel interim storage safety, in addition improvements have been made in NPP’s LILW management and non-nuclear radioactive waste disposal, and there has been significant progress in the planning of the research reactor decommissioning. Furthermore, the legislative and regulatory framework has been enhanced, national competences for future needs have been evaluated and developed, and the IRRS follow-up mission (IAEA’s Integrated Regulatory Review Service) was carried out in Finland. Only the main achievements are presented in this summary section. More detailed information on the latest developments in the various topics of the Convention is provided in connection with the relevant articles. Section K summarises the main achievements from the reporting period and also presents Finland’s future challenges in nuclear and radioactive waste management. Since the 5 th Review Meeting The 5 th Review Meeting in 2015 identified challenges, and recorded some planned measures to improve the safety of nuclear waste management in Finland. On request of the Review Meeting these issues and the responsed are included in this 6 th National Report of Finland. The issues are listed here, with the related references provided in brackets. A summary of how Finland has proceeded with the identified challenges during the reporting period is given in Section K. Finland – Challenges • Construction and oversight of the spent fuel (SF) disposal facility (Section H, Annexes L. 2 and L. 3) • Decommissioning and waste management of the FiR 1 research reactor (Article 9, Article 26, Annex L. 5) • Ensuring adequate resources and competence in tough economic situations (utilities, waste management organizations, and Government) (Article 20, Article 22) • Communication with public and stakeholders to maintain confidence in safe waste management and regulatory framework (Article 20) • Disposal of a few High-Activity Sealed Sources (HASS), which are not suitable for disposal in existing LILW repositories (Section J). Finland – Planned Measures to Improve Safety • Licensing of the encapsulation plant and the disposal facility for encapsulated spent fuel (Section H, Annexes L. 2 and L. 3) • Implementation of recommendations from the IRRS review (Article 20) • Licensing of research reactor decommissioning and start of dismantling activities (Article 9, Article 26, Annex L. 5). The legislative and regulatory system has been enhanced The current Finnish nuclear legislation is based on the Nuclear Energy Act from 1987, together with a supporting Nuclear Energy Decree from 1988. The Nuclear Energy Act has been revised several times over the years. The revision of the Nuclear Energy Act in 2015 enabled STUK to issue legally binding regulations. Based on the Nuclear Energy Act, STUK issued four regulations in 2016 to replace the earlier Government Decrees on nuclear safety for nuclear power plants, the security in the use of nuclear energy, the emergency response arrangements at nuclear power plants, and the disposal of nuclear waste. In addition, one new regulation for the safety of uranium and thorium production was issued. Development of national competences for future needs STUK’s role and responsibilities were assessed in a peer review, as part of the IRRS mission (IAEA’s Integrated Regulatory Review Service), in October 2012. In the followup mission in June 2015 the regulatory activities in Finland were reviewed based on the IAEA Safety Standards and international best practices. The main conclusion of the IRRS follow up mission was that STUK had made significant progress in most areas and many improvements had been implemented in accordance with the action plan. The implementation of the recommendations from the “Nuclear Energy Research Strategy”-report from 2013 is on-going by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment (MEAE). The main aim is to ensure the availability of the competent resources for the safe use of nuclear energy. As an example of the on-going implementation of the recommendations, the Nuclear Energy Act was updated in 2015 to ensure the financing of the enhancement of the nuclear safety research infrastructure. In addition to the basic training given for the nuclear sciences in universities in Espoo, Helsinki, and Lappeenranta, the availability of competent human resources has also been improved by the additional training of young experts in the nuclear safety field in different ways, e. g. through a networked doctoral programme (YTERA – Doctoral programme for Nuclear Engineering and Radiochemistry in 2012 – 2015) and through separately arranged national courses focusing on nuclear and waste management safety (YK and YJH Courses). Due to the rearrangement of research funding instruments in Finland and additional budget cuts by the Government, STUK has partly terminated and also significantly reduced its radiation safety research. Instead of its own research programme, STUK has established a national radiation safety research programme in co-operation with all universities in Finland to ensure that radiation safety research will continue in Finland. The spent nuclear fuel disposal project has progressed to the construction phase The Finnish nuclear fuel cycle policy is based on the once-through principle. After removal from the reactor spent fuel is stored in interim pool type storages at the power plant sites. After a storage period lasting tens of years, the spent fuel will be disposed of deep in the Finnish bedrock. Posiva submitted construction licence application and supporting safety documentation to the authorities at the end of 2012. STUK’s safety review and assessment was submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment (MEAE) in February 2015. The construction licence was granted by the Government to Posiva in November 2015. The construction of the disposal facility started in December 2016. Posiva is responsible for the preparations for and later on for the implementation of the disposal of spent fuel of its owners TVO and FPH. The disposal project and the granted licence cover spent fuel from five reactors: Loviisa 1 and 2, in addition to Olkiluoto 1, 2 and 3. In the Decision-in-Principle for Fennovoima’s new reactor unit, Fennovoima was required to define its plans for future spent nuclear fuel management and disposal by the end of June 2016. As required, in June 2016 Fennovoima submitted an Environmental Impact Assessment programme for its planned spent fuel disposal activities to the MEAE. Fennovoima and Posiva Solutions Oy (Posiva’s subsidiary that focuses on supplying services) have signed a co-operation agreement to ensure that the expertise of Posiva is available for Fennovoima’s spent nuclear fuel management activities. The co-operation started in 2016. Spent fuel interim storage safety has been enhanced The safety of the spent fuel storages was analysed {{as a part of the}} EU stress tests in relation to the Fukushima Dai-ichi accident. Hazards or deficiencies that would have required immediate action were not found, but areas where safety could be further enhanced were identified (e. g. reducing the dependency on nuclear power plant’s normal electricity supply and distribution systems as well as on the sea water cooled systems for residual heat removal of the reactor, containment and spent fuel storage pools, protection against external flooding, seismic resistance of spent fuel pools, and firefighting systems). The spent fuel interim storage facility in Olkiluoto undergone numerous improvements during its capacity extension, which became operational in summer 2015. These included, e. g. protection against large airplane crashes and enabling a cooling water feed from outside the storage area. Based on the evaluation in relation to the Fukushima Daiichi accident, water level and temperature monitoring functions have been improved for earthquake resistance and for the potential loss of the facility power supply. Additionally, the Loviisa spent fuel storage has been improved after the Fukushima Daiichi accident. The main changes are aimed at reducing the dependency on the plant’s normal electricity supply and distribution system, as well as on seawater cooled systems for residual heat removal from the reactor, containment and spent fuel pools. Furthermore, the flood protection of the NPP has been improved. Operation in low and intermediate level waste management proceeded The <b>predisposal</b> management of LILW was developed in Loviisa NPP during the reporting period as the solidification plant was authorized for full operation in 2016. Loviisa NPP has now been able to start the solidification of historical liquid wastes, which had been stored in tanks from the start of NPP’s operation in the late 1970 s. The aim is to solidify and dispose of all existing liquid waste in the forthcoming years. The disposal of non-nuclear radioactive waste has commenced Non-nuclear radioactive wastes originating, e. g. from research, industry and hospitals has been stored in a cavern in the LILW disposal facility at Olkiluoto. The licence conditions of the Olkiluoto LILW disposal facility were revised in 2012. The revised license enabled the disposal of non-nuclear radioactive waste in the Olkiluoto LILW disposal facility. The disposal of non-nuclear radioactive waste started in 2016 and currently most waste accumulated over the years have been disposed of. Planning for decommissioning Finland’s first nuclear reactor has started The research reactor FiR 1 (TRIGA Mark II, 250 kW) has been in operation since 1962. The operation of FiR 1 has been carried out by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd. in Espoo since 1971. In 2012, VTT decided to shut down the research reactor due to insufficient funding for its continued operation. The Environmental Impact Assessment procedure for the decommissioning was conducted in 2013 - 2015. FiR 1 will be the first nuclear reactor to be decommissioned in Finland. VTT submitted an application to the Government for a decommissioning licence on June 20, 2017 (formally this is a new operating licence as the present Finnish legislation does not define a decommissioning licence). The dismantling is scheduled to start in early 2019 and to last about two years. The dismantling will be regulated by STUK concerning the radiation and nuclear safety aspects. Challenges for future work in spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste management Finland has identified for itself challenges for the future work in spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste management and these are summarized below. Progress in spent nuclear fuel disposal programme has been identified as a continuous challenge because the proceeding project requires the development of regulatory requirements. Moreover, regulatory oversight needs to be developed and adjusted for the different project phases. STUK has procedures in place to review and update plans and regulations as the disposal project proceeds to each new phase and the needs for development are identified. Furthermore, Posiva is well prepared for the construction phase of the disposal project and preparations are ongoing for the forthcoming operation phase. In addition, the development of national competences and a regulatory framework are identified as a continuous challenge because the nuclear field in Finland is very active at the moment and compentent resources are required both for regulatory oversight as well as for licensees and license applicants. Finland has identified following three main challenges for the future work: • Improvement of the national plan for radioactive waste management Finland has a well-functioning system and technical solutions for the management of nuclear waste arising from NPPs and also for major part of non-nuclear radioactive wastes. However, as a consequence of 1) an incident at a sealed radioactive source in the storage facilities in Suomen Nukliditekniikka and its related clean-up work (for more detail information see Section J, article 28), 2) planning of the research reactor decommissioning waste storage and disposal and 3) unresolved challenges of disposal for a few HASS sources, it has been identified that the national radioactive waste management plan and licensing system needs to be evaluated and improved to ensure a national system with capabilities for all possible waste streams. MEAE has invited an ad-hoc expert group to address these issues. The group will also address recommendations made by the Finnish Safety Investigation Authority about the sealed source incident. This group will start its work in autumn 2017. • Developing competences and a regulatory framework for decommissioning The research reactor, FiR 1, will be the first nuclear reactor to be decommissioned in Finland. As this is the first decommissioning project, Finland has limited experience in this area. VTT and STUK are both co-operating internationally gathering knowledge and experience about the implementation and regulation of decommissioning. The decommissioning project of the research reactor is also a very important learning process for STUK as the experiences gained will be used in updating regulations and YVL guides and also later on in planning the regulatory oversight for the decommissioning of NPPs. • Communication to improve general public’s understanding of disposal safety The Finnish public has a high degree of trust in the radiation and nuclear safety regulator, STUK, and there is a good degree of trust towards the safety of nuclear waste management and disposal. However, the interest of the general public towards disposal seems to be declining. Additionally, the latest poll results (conducted by e. g. Finnish Energy in 2016) show indications of a slight decrease in trust towards thesafety of nuclear waste disposal. Developments of these trends need to be followed in forthcoming polls. The regulatory work and decisions made by the regulator have to be clear and understandable to the general public. The general public should also have the correct understanding of disposal safety and related risks. Due to these challenges, STUK, for its part, initiated a strategic communication development project in spring 2016 to address both the changing communication environment and the use of modern communication tools. Candidate for good practice Finland has identified that the granting of the construction licence for a spent fuel disposal facility is a candidate for good practice. Finland is the first country that has granted a construction licence for a final repository for spent fuel. Construction of the facility is ongoing. The development and evaluation of safe disposal has been a long-lasting systematic process involving conducted in good co-operation with the Government, ministries, regulators, Posiva, nuclear power companies as well as research organisations while acknowledging the roles and responsibilities of the different parties. The approach taken in Finland has enabled timely progress of the disposal project with political and public support and resulted in approval of the construction licencelicence application in 2015. This is a concrete step towards improving safety in a unique and proven manner. Conclusion In conclusion, based on the information presented in the report, Finland complies with the obligations and objectives of the Joint Convention. Challenges for the future have been recognized, regularly reviewed and addressed. The required efforts for continuous improvement have been made...|$|E
