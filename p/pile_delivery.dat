40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the use of pre-stressed precast foundation piles using data collected on a building project that comprised the installation of more than 340 piles. The objective is to assess the presence of product and process variability in demand and supply, and the impact it has on precast <b>pile</b> <b>delivery.</b> Sources of variability in precasting, transportation, and installation are described. As a step towards understanding the complexity of this production system and to show how production planning decisions affect execution, this paper elaborates on two deterministic scenarios and compares those with actual data from the project. Performance of the system is analyzed on the basis of inventory vs. work completed. From the perspective of ‘lean ’ thinking the paper then identifies sources of waste and suggests means to eliminate them. It also presents questions for follow-on research.

With production going well, iron <b>piled</b> up. <b>Delivery</b> was a problem. After {{experimenting with a}} horse-powered tram road, the company realized that a rail line, built down the Georges Creek Valley toward the Potomac River at Westernport, would be {{the answer to the}} transportation issue.|$|R

The imprint with {{a stable}} color {{characteristics}} and saturation while printing on non-absorbing substrates {{is determined by}} the reaction of ink and the substrate. To stabilize the printing process and to ensure the standardized color reproduction parameters on the substrates that have got a non-absorbing surface it is proposed to place into the offset ink formula (combining with the general components like pigment, mixture of solid resins and oligomers) the mixture of ethoxylated linear secondary alcohols and alcoxylates, which stabilizes the ink-water balance, makes the even ink transfer on all the substrate surface; and also to place the target additives to increase the printing production productivity and increase the height of the imprints <b>pile</b> on the <b>delivery.</b> For white ink of the screen printing it is proposed to combine the phenol-formaldehyde resins and resins based on the vinilidenchloryde derivatives, organic solvents, glycol derivatives, fluorescent components, and surfactants to achieve easy squeezing of the ink through the printing element high-dens printing form net, to reach an even layer of the ink on the substrate, high adhesion, exact image reproduction, and standardized parameters in CIE LAB system for typical papers. The complex methodology is developed and certified to examine the reproduction parameters depending on the components of printing form making process and the printing process: printing substrate composition, structure and characteristics, reproduction original, type of printing equipment and control systems. The mathematical models of the reproduction processes basing on the parameters of the system ?original-imprint? are developed to predict the imprints? properties and to evaluate the figures reliability and also to ensure the printing stability of the printing forms. The recommendations for mass ink production and conducting the technological reproduction process are developed. ???????????? ?????? ??????????? ?? ??????????? ????????? ???????????????? ? ????????????? ?? ????????????? ???????????? ????????? ?????????? ?????????????? ??????????????? ???????? ?????? ? ??????????????? ?????????. ??? ???????????? ???????? ????????? ? ??????????? ????????????? ??????????? ???????????????????? ?? ?????????????? ?????????? ? ????????????? ???????????? ?????????? ??????? ? ?????? ?????? ??? ???????? ?????? ? ????????? ? ????????? ????????????? ? ?????????, ?????? ??????? ????, ???????????, ? ??????? ??????? ?? ????? ???????????????? ???????? ????????? ??????? ? ???????????? ??? ???????????? ?????-????????? ???????? ? ????????????? ?????????????? ?? ???? ??????? ??????? ? ????????? ?????????????????? ???????? ?????? ? ?????????? ?????? ????? ????????. ??? ????? ?????? ??????????? ?????? ?????????? ????????? ??????-??????????????? ? ???? ?? ?????? ??????????? ????????????????, ???????????? ?????????????, ??????????? ????????, ?????????????? ???????????, ????????????-???????? ??????? ??? ??????????? ??????? ????????????? ?????? ?????? ?????????? ????????? ?????????????? ????????? ????????? ?????, ???????????? ???? ?????? ?? ?????????????? ???????????, ??????? ???????, ???????? ??????????????? ??????????? ? ????????????? ??????????? ? ??????? ?IE LAB ??? ??????? ?????? ?????. ??????????? ? ???????????? ??????????? ???????? ?????? ?????????? ???????????????? ? ??????????? ?? ???????????? ???????? ? ????????? ?????????; ???????, ????????? ? ????????????? ?????????????? ???????????, ???????????, ???? ???????????? ? ?????? ??????????. ??????????? ?????????????? ?????? ???????? ???????????????? ?? ????????? ?????????? ??????? ?????????-??????? ??? ???????? ??????? ??????????? ? ?????? ?????????? ?? ??????????? ? ??????????? ???????? ???????????? ???????? ????. ??????????? ???????????? ?? ???????????? ?????? ?????? ? ??????? ???????????????? ???????? ????????????????...|$|R
