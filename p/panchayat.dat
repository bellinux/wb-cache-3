5|$|The local {{government}} bodies; <b>Panchayat,</b> Municipalities and Corporations have existed in Kerala since 1959, however, the major initiative to decentralise the governance {{was started in}} 1993, conforming to the constitutional amendments of central government in this direction.

The Kerala Panchayati Raj Act envisages a 3-tier system of {{local government}} with Gram <b>panchayat,</b> Block <b>panchayat</b> and District <b>Panchayat</b> forming a hierarchy. The acts ensure a clear demarcation of power among these institutions. However, the Kerala Municipality Act envisages a single-tier system for urban areas, with the institution of municipality designed to par with the Gram <b>panchayat</b> of the former system. Substantial administrative, legal and financial powers are delegated to these bodies to ensure efficient decentralisation. As per the present norms, the state government devolves about 40 per cent of the state plan outlay to the local government.|$|E
