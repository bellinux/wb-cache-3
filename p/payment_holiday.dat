50|$|Kirsty later suffers Braxton Hicks contractions in {{the cafe}} and panics when she can't get hold of Tyrone. When she learns that he was fixing Fiz Stape's (Jennie McAlpine) boiler, she gets jealous and they argue again. She destroys plates {{and a picture of}} Tyrone and Jack Duckworth (Bill Tarmey) but apologises, blaming her {{pregnancy}} hormones. When Tyrone and Fiz organise a baby shower and Tyrone tells Kirsty that Fiz helped him pick out items for the baby, she gets jealous again and insists that Tyrone has no further contact with Fiz. Her anger is sparked again when she learns that he has given Tommy a <b>payment</b> <b>holiday</b> so he and Tina can visit his grandmother in Blackpool. This causes another argument and she hits him again, using an accessory from a vacuum cleaner, leaving him badly bruised. This time, Tyrone asks Kirsty to see a doctor about her anger issues but she leaves just before the appointment but Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride) tells Tyrone this so they argue in the garden and angry, Tyrone pushes Kirsty away from him and she falls, cutting her head. Deirdre, having overheard the argument, asks Kirsty if she is okay and calls Dr. Matt Carter (Oliver Mellor), while Kirsty sends Tyrone to the pub so she can have a nap. When Tyrone returns, he finds Kirsty has packed her bags and she leaves, despite Tyrone asking her to stay. Tommy finds Kirsty at the hospital and asks her to come back, as Tyrone is suffering without her. Despite initially refusing, she returns {{a couple of days later}} and finds Tyrone talking to another woman while Dev chats to her friend. He asks her to stay and she agrees, angering Tina so she tells Tommy that Kirsty was abusing Tyrone and insists Tommy and Tina increase their repayments. She also causes problems by costing Tommy a security job and persuading Julie Carp (Katy Cavanagh) and Brian Packham (Peter Gunn) to buy Jason Grimshaw's (Ryan Thomas) flat, making Tina and Tommy homeless. They move into Owen Armstrong's (Ian Puleston-Davies) flat over the builder's yard.|$|E

50|$|If {{a notice}} period {{such as one}} month is {{required}} for an employer to terminate a contract, a 'payment in lieu of notice' is immediate compensation at an amount equal to that an employee would have earned as salary or wages by working through the whole notice period: for example, one month's salary. A payment in lieu will include <b>payment</b> for <b>holiday</b> entitlements if the employee has them.|$|R
50|$|Group A was {{normally}} {{only found}} at larger Bahnbetriebswerke because there the managerial workload was the greatest. At smaller depots the shedmaster (Bahnbetriebswerkvorsteher) took on these tasks; medium-sized Betriebswerke the management functions were split between groups B and C. Group A had {{to draw up}} plans for the efficient running of the depot and for the allocation of locomotives. In addition they {{were responsible for the}} overall budget (awarding of fuel efficiency bonuses and <b>payment</b> of <b>holiday</b> and sickness pay). The management of operating records and locomotive cards (including mileages and fuel consumption of the rolling stock) as well as the oversight of energy consumption and the consumption of fuels (especially coal, water and gas) were also assigned to this group.|$|R
5000|$|The European Court of Justice {{held that}} giving rolled up holiday pay was not permissible, {{because it could}} create a {{disincentive}} for workers to take holidays. Holidays are a principle of Community law from which {{there could be no}} derogations. Article 7(1) was intended to enable workers to actually take leave. The point of <b>payment</b> for <b>holidays</b> was that a worker would be in a position comparable during leave as when leave is taken. Article 7(2) made clear that a payment in lieu could be taken only where the employment relationship is terminated. Otherwise the right to leave would effectively be replaced by payment in lieu. However employers are entitled to set off rolled up pay against periods of leave that are [...] "actually taken".|$|R
30|$|High {{seasonality}} {{of wages}} {{can also be}} pointed out. During the summer months, there is a relatively large increase due to <b>holiday</b> <b>payments</b> {{and at the end}} of the year, there are also different annual bonuses being paid to the employees. There are also anecdotal evidence that in some sectors (for instance in construction) hourly wages for some occupations or work tasks remained the same but the piece-wise job requirements were raised. It means that you have to work more in order to get the previous payment.|$|R
40|$|Some of {{the recent}} changes to {{employment}} legislation in New Zealand are working as intended, this report finds. Overview: This report provides a short-term evaluation of the 2010 amendments to the Employment Relations Act 2000 and Holidays Act 2003. The evaluation follows a mixed methods approach, based on qualitative interviews and quantitative survey data, and includes the following key areas of legislative change; 	allowing all employers the option to use trial periods 	changes to the Holidays Act (cashing up annual holidays, transferring public <b>holidays,</b> <b>payment</b> for some <b>holidays</b> and leave and providing proof of sickness) 	making union access to workplaces conditional on employer consent, and 	changes in provisions relating to employment problem resolution. For trial periods, some {{of the benefits of}} extending coverage to all businesses identified included reduced risk when hiring new people, greater flexibility, ease and security of use and some cost savings for employers. The report shows that extending the use of trial periods to all employers has resulted in more employment opportunities, with one third of employers surveyed saying the provision has led to them hiring people they otherwise wouldn’t have. For the Holidays Act amendments, benefits included greater flexibility and increased choices for some employers and employees. In some cases the evaluation found that the successful uptake of the changes has been affected by variable levels of understanding and difficulty applying the changes. For example, employers are finding that some Holidays Act provisions are still difficult to apply in some work arrangements, such as for people with variable work hours...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the {{government}} has improved on its provisions for severance pay and the long service <b>payment,</b> mandated more <b>holidays</b> for workers, and mandated industrial safety rules, in addition to introducing other pro-labour policies. These policies reflect, in part, a natural desire to share the benefits of Hong Kong’s increasing wealth among more people and, in part, {{a shift in the}} political environment with the emergence of more powerful pro-labour pressure groups and of political parties seeking broad community support. But {{it is important to recognize}} that however well intentioned, government intervention is costly, and is not justified unless the cost of the identified market failure is greater than the cost of the intervention. How shall we evaluate the large variety of current and proposed labour-market policies? The next section presents a general framework for analyzing labour-market policies. Some guiding principles emerge from the discussion. The chapter then takes up six specific, topical problems as illustrative cases for discussion: labour importation; training; wage subsides for disadvantaged workers; unemployment protection; minimum wages legislation; and labour relations...|$|R
40|$|Wage {{supplements}} in {{the form}} of private fringe benefits and statutory contributions to social welfare account for around 25 per cent of the typical firm's total labour costs throughout OECD countries. Yet the relative emphasis on private and statutory payments differs from country to country. For example, the ratio of statutory contributions to private fringes (excluding <b>holiday</b> <b>payments)</b> was 5 0 in the FRG compared to 0. 9 in the USA in 1981. This paper critically assesses the economic arguments for and against both forms of non-wage payment. On the private side, the discussion concentrates on human capital anti union median voter explanations for private fringe payments. Attention is also given to the implications of favourable corporate and individual tax concessions with respect both to the demand for private fringes and to the evaluation of their human capital effects. On the statutory side, social security contributions are discussed in relation to general social welfare, government employment policy and employer-union relations. As part of the general assessment, it is argued that governments should provide a Fiscal framework in this area which is designed to stimulate more effective individual and firm-level choice between equivalent forms of private and statutory supplementary compensation...|$|R
