Until recently, such complex dynamic processes {{could not be}} rigorously empirically analyzed {{because of a lack}} of suitable modeling and validation methods. Using stochastic actor-oriented models and unique longitudinal survey data on the changing structure of interfirm production networks in the automotive industry in Japan, this paper illustrates how to quantitatively assess and validate (1) the dynamic micro-mechanism by which organizations form their networks and (2) the role of the dynamic network structures in organizational performance. The applied model helps to explain the endogenous processes behind the recent diversification of Japanese automobile production networks. Specifically, testing the effects of network topology and network diffusion on organizational performance, the novel modeling framework enables us to discern that the restructuring of interorganizational networks led to the increase of Japanese automakers’ <b>production</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee,</b> and not the reverse. Traditional models that do not allow for interaction between interorganizational structure and organizational agency misrepresent this mechanism.|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyzed}} the {{variations of the}} biomass (including crop, forestry, fishery and livestock) production in the Choushui River Basin in the middle Taiwan to establish the useful information and indicators. The material production of biomass materials (MPB) during 1987 to 2002 were computed from the available date and assessed. The results revealed that the contribution of rice planting in the Choushui River Basin had decreased recently. Accordingly, the contribution of rice production (MR) in the Choushui River Basin for the whole rice product (MRTWN) in Taiwan also reduced as well. The values of MR/MRTWN with the slight variation had the average value of 8. 3 % with the maximum and minimum values of 9. 2 % in 1988 and 6. 9 % in 1999, respectively. Furthermore, MPB in the Choushui River Basin generally increased before 1993 and after 1997, and had the lower value in 1994 - 1996 (968, 670 - 1, 020, 550 tons). In overall, the values of MPB were 961, 760 and 1, 265, 420 tons in 1987 and 2002 with average value of 1, 143, 850 tons. In addition, the variations of the ratio of farm to total populations (PFa/PT) and cultivated land area (AC) were addressed. The values of PFa/PT and AC were 54 - 64 % and 54, 070 - 58, 770 ha with average values of 60 % and 57, 660 ha, respectively.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the contribution}} of efficiency as a mechanism of labour productivity convergence, taking as {{the unit of analysis}} the Spanish regions in the period 1964 - 1993. Using the stochastic frontier approach, a translogarithmic production function is estimated for the different sectors of the Spanish regional economy, demonstrating on this basis the existence of substantial differences in efficiency between sectors as well as between regions. With regard to convergence, the results obtained indicate that at aggregate level the convergence observed in labour productivity is explained by the faster growth of the capital-labour ratio of the initially poorer regions and {{the contribution of}} technical change and the efficiency, hence by the convergence of TFP. However, the information by sectors shows different results. Thus, on the one hand, the importance of the convergence in <b>production</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> is seen in all sectors except agriculture and, on the other it is observed that technical change is a factor of convergence in all sectors but construction, and, qualitatively, the contribution of technical change is greater than the contribution of efficiency. By sectors, technical change contributed significantly to labour productivity convergence in agriculture, but the faster growth of the capital-labour ratio of the rich regions acted as a mechanism of divergence, completely counteracting the technological catching-up effect. It is further concluded that, as well as the contribution of the accumulation of factors, the positive evolution of efficiency in the poorest regions favoured convergence in the construction and industry sectors, whereas technical progress was decisive in industry and the services sectors. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{data on the}} {{production}} and catch of fish according to sorts, pond ackerage, fishing means {{as well as the}} distribution of production and catch in 1995 have been stated in the paper. Ackerages used for the fish production have been increased by 1710 acres or 6. 51 %; total fish prinos* is less for 1, 252 tons or 17. 05 %. The highest production of fish was reched by the fish farm Donji Miholjac with 859 kg/ha. A nutritive coefficient is 3. 0 kg and it is less by 3. 22 % compared with the previous year. The nutritive coefficient is less than 2. 0 kg in three fish-farms but it is greater than 4. 0 kg in five large fish farms. Mostly corn but also wheat dominate in fish nutrition. The fertilizers consumption has been reduced by 14. 53 %. Of total pond ackerage, growing fish farms occupy 1. 25 %, new fish farms occupy 17. 90 % and consumptive fish farms occupy 79. 64 %. Total fish production in carp ponds is 507 kg/ha and 136. 1 ton/ha in trout ponds. With 84. 33 %, carp is the mostly produced fish sorts, herbivore fish follow it with 3. 89 % and {{the production}} of all other fish makes 11. 78 % of the total. With 83. 97 %, grass carp takes the first place in the structure of herbivore fish. It is followed by the big head carp with 9. 28 % and silver carp with 6. 75 %. The trout production has been slightly increased by 6. 3 %. Pike has appeared again and all other fish sorts has been reduced. Fish catch in open water has been increased by 7. 06 % compared with the previous year. When we sum up total production and catch of fresh-water fish, we can conclude that carp contributes with 81. 08 %; herbivore fish with 3. 67 %; trouts with 5. 53 %; sheat-fish, pike-perch and pike with 2. 74 % and all other fish sorts with 6. 98 %. As to the distribution of production and catch, there has been 49. 02 % sold on markets, 38. 02 % has been spent on farm reproduction (set back in ponds), the percentage of mortalities is 7. 90 %. Sport fishers have spent 5. 06 % of fish. The number of employees has been reduced by 12. 05 % and fish <b>production</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> has also been reduced by 1. 10 % compared with the previous year.

The greatest differences between them were obvious in sectors of textile, footwear and food industry.

From 1946 till 1948 {{the most effective and}} the largest private enterprises were nationalized, particularly textile industry, footwear industry, food industry and several more sectors. The private industrial undertakings did not get too high subsidies, if they have gotten something, as state public industrial enterprises.

This paper analyses the cross relationship among various components of productivity like earning <b>per</b> <b>employee,</b> business <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> and profit <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> for public, private and foreign sector banks within the Indian Banking Industry using data for five years i. e. the period starting from 2001 - 02 to 2005 - 06.

Results show that foreign sector banks are outshining with their performance in all the selected parameters during the period of this study. In terms of ACGR and absolute numbers too, these banks have been on top in all the categories. However the average ACGR, taking all the banks of one sector together, is highest for public sector banks in case of business <b>per</b> <b>employee.</b> It shows that public sector banks are growing with consistent pace and intra group variations are also less than other sectors.
