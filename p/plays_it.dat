5|$|Later {{copies of}} the second state, with minor retouching, were also printed from the plate by Thomas Cotes in 1632, for Robert Allot's Second Folio, a new edition of the {{collected}} <b>plays.</b> <b>It</b> was also reused in later folios, although by then the plate was beginning to wear out and was heavily re-engraved. The original plate was still being used into the 1660s, and then disappears. Already in 1640 William Marshall had copied and adapted the design on a new plate for John Benson's edition of Shakespeare's sonnets. All subsequent engraved reprintings of the portrait were made by later engravers copying the original printed image.|$|E

Media Corporation of Singapore's Channel 5, Channel 8 and Channel NewsAsia, for example, played the anthem just before 6:00 am daily to signal the start of their respective channel's broadcast day; while all of its owned radio stations begin their day by playing the abridged version of the anthem (consisting of the first six bars) at exactly 6:00 am, except Malay station Warna 94.2FM which <b>plays</b> <b>it</b> at 5:00 am as a way of protecting the protocol from reaching the Islamic Azan Subuh (which occurs between around 5:25 and 5:58 am).|$|E

5|$|Planetarian is a post-apocalyptic visual {{novel in}} which the player assumes {{the role of the}} junker. Unlike {{traditional}} visual novels, no choices are given to the player in Planetarian to advance the story, and there is only one possible ending; this is what Key referred to as a kinetic novel. The player can choose when to advance to the next dialogue screen or put the game on auto play. In this respect, the player does not play the game {{as if it were a}} video game, but <b>plays</b> <b>it</b> rather more like one would play a music track on a CD or play a DVD film. During gameplay, the player can choose to hide the text from view and go back to any previous lines. The game can be saved at any point in any of the five save slots available, and a load option is available where the player can load any of the automatically saved chapter markers, or choose to load any of the manually saved games.|$|E
5|$|When the {{trapdoor}} to {{the cellar}} mysteriously flies open during dinner, Ash and Scotty {{go down to}} investigate and find the Naturom Demonto, a Sumerian version of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, along with a tape recorder belonging to the archaeologist who owned it. When Scotty <b>plays</b> <b>it,</b> the archaeologist's voice recites a series of incantations, resurrecting a mysterious, demonic entity. Cheryl becomes increasingly hysterical and locks herself in her room. Later, she hears strange voices and goes outside to investigate. Meanwhile, Ash gives Linda a silver necklace, which she absolutely loves. Cheryl is then attacked and raped by demonically possessed trees, but manages to escape. Unable to convince the others of what happened, she asks Ash to take her into town for the night. However, Ash soon discovers that the bridge has been destroyed. Back at the cabin, Ash listens to more of the tape, learning {{that the only way}} to kill the entity is to dismember it when it possesses a host. Cheryl succumbs to the entity and attacks the others, stabbing Linda in the ankle with a pencil before Scotty is able to force her into the cellar.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later, Mick and Tina go to Babe's house to confront her, as Stan's ashes have been {{replaced}} by custard powder, only to be greeted by a man who says that Babe has moved to Ramsgate. Along with Shirley, they track Babe down to a caravan in Ramsgate, where Babe states she was evicted from her house. Later, Shirley discovers a scrapbook of photos of young pregnant girls with due dates written on the back and realises that Babe and Queenie had kidnapped these girls and had their babies adopted out. Shirley is disgusted by Babe's actions and threatens to set her fire to her caravan, but Mick stops her. However, Babe burns the caravan down herself, realising that she needs to move on, and returns to Walford with Shirley, Mick and Tina. Linda's mother, Elaine Peacock (Maria Friedman), and her toyboy fiancé, Jason Adams (Scott Neal), temporarily move into the Vic. Babe does not trust Jason, although they have a passionate encounter, which is caught by Mick and Linda. Linda asks Babe to ensure Jason leaves Walford without informing Elaine of the reason, but when Elaine teases Babe, she reveals that she had sex with Jason. Elaine refuses to believe this, while Jason suggests that he and Babe steal from the pub and leave together. Babe secretly records the conversation and <b>plays</b> <b>it</b> to the Carters, who force Jason to leave. Babe admits to Elaine and Linda that she and Jason did not have sex and that she feels lonely. Babe continues to clash with Cora and is humiliated when Cora exposes her baby farming past to the Carter family and the pub's customers. Linda contemplates evicting Babe, but after Babe successfully leads a protest to house Cora, Linda allows Babe to stay.|$|E

25|$|Realism {{began to}} {{influence}} American drama, partly through Howells, but also through Europeans such as Ibsen and Zola. Although realism was most influential in set design and staging—audiences loved {{the special effects}} offered up by the popular melodramas—and {{in the growth of}} local color <b>plays,</b> <b>it</b> also showed up in the more subdued, less romantic tone that reflected the effects of the Civil War and continued social turmoil on the American psyche.|$|E

25|$|Delay is {{an audio}} effect and an effects unit which records an input signal to an audio storage medium, and then <b>plays</b> <b>it</b> {{back after a}} period of time. The delayed signal may either be played back {{multiple}} times, or played back into the recording again, to create the sound of a repeating, decaying echo. Delay effects range from a subtle echo effect to a pronounced blending of previous sounds with new sounds. Delay effects can be created using tape loops, an approach developed in the 1940s and 1950s; analog effects units, which were introduced in the 1970s; digital effects pedals, introduced in 1984; and audio software plugins, developed in the 2000s.|$|E
25|$|A batsman {{may play}} a bouncer in either a {{defensive}} or an attacking way. If the batsman <b>plays</b> <b>it</b> defensively he aims primarily to avoid getting out, and secondarily to avoid being hit by the ball. For a head-high bouncer, these goals are achieved most easily by ducking under the ball. If the ball is at chest height, the batsman's best defence is {{to move on to}} his back foot, raise his bat vertically to chest height, and attempt to block the ball and direct it downwards to the pitch so as to avoid presenting a catch to a fielder. Sometimes the batsman will need to jump into the air to gain the necessary height to defend with the bat. He may also sway out of the way. Given these approaches, the bowler can hope to both intimidate the batsman somewhat, and possibly have the ball deflect off the bat at an awkward angle and produce a catch for a nearby fielder.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, the bouncer {{can be a}} very {{productive}} ball for the batsman, if he <b>plays</b> <b>it</b> in an attacking manner. The shot that is used to attack the bouncer is the hook shot. To play the hook shot the batsman moves his back foot backwards and towards the off side as the ball is being delivered. As the ball approaches, the batsman swivels from facing the off side to facing the leg side, while holding the bat horizontally. The batsman's aim is to hit the ball at high speed towards, into or over the leg side boundary. However, despite their run-scoring potential, hook shots frequently lead to wickets falling, particularly through balls hitting the top edge of the bat and being caught by leg side fielders. However, if the bouncer is misdirected by the bowler, and reaches the batsman on the off side of his wicket, the cut, uppercut or late cut can be played, either with the intention of guiding the ball along the ground, through a gap in the field setting, or over the infield for four or six.|$|E
