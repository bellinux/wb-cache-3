Despite efforts to engage youth in education, there have been only modest improvements in the rates of school completion across OECD countries since the mid- 1990 s. These modest improvements underline the importance of <b>programs</b> <b>that</b> encourage early school leavers to return to post-school education. The objective {{of this paper is to}} better understand the factors that affect the chances of re-engaging early school leavers in education, with a particular focus on the importance of time out from school (duration dependence) and school-related factors. Using data from three cohorts of the Longitudinal Survey of Australian Youth and duration models that control for unobserved heterogeneity, this paper 2 ̆ 7 s results suggest <b>that</b> <b>programs</b> <b>that</b> encourage an early return to study and <b>programs</b> <b>that</b> develop post-school career plans may be more effective than <b>programs</b> <b>that</b> concentrate on improving numeracy and literacy scores.
