After attachment to the termination, a tensioning operation was performed on each bundle at the eastern anchor point, and the bundles were suspended a few feet above the catwalk. A total of 137 such bundles were installed. As bundles were positioned, they were temporarily tied together to form the cable. The cable was completely in place in late May 2012.

This differs from the <b>protective</b> grounding <b>wire,</b> which only carries current under fault conditions. Using the neutral conductor for grounding the equipment enclosure was considered safe since the devices were permanently wired to the supply and so the neutral was unlikely to be broken without also breaking both supply conductors. Also, the unbalanced current due to lamps and small motors in the appliances was small compared to the rating of the conductors and therefore unlikely to cause a large voltage drop in the neutral conductor.|$|R

My objective {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of wrapping <b>protective</b> <b>wire</b> netting around the trunk of the tree in preventing and reducing bark stripping by elephants. 2, 668 trees, 1352 marula (Sclerocarya birrea), 857 knobthorn (Acacia Nigrescens), and 459 false marula (Lannea schweinfurti), were assessed for elephant impact in the APNR, 1387 (52 %) of which had previously been wrapped in <b>protective</b> <b>wire</b> netting (789, 548, and 50 respectively). For knobthorn and marula, wire netting significantly decreased the number of the trees that were bark stripped. For all trees, wire netting decreased the level of bark stripping especially for the highest impact levels. No trees wrapped with wire were ringbarked, compared to 23 unwired trees. In addition, wire netting had an effect on the distribution of damage for the highest impact class incurred regardless of type. A higher relative frequency of wired trees were found in lower impact categories compared to unwired trees. Wire netting is a low maintenance and ecologically valuable technique that alleviates bark stripping for some species.

At high densities, elephants potentially have negative impacts on the environment, specifically for large trees. Because of this, recent increases of elephants in the Associated Private Nature Reserves (APNR) on the western boundary of the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, have caused concern regarding the survival of several tree species. Our objective {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of wrapping <b>protective</b> <b>wire</b> netting around the trunk of the tree for preventing and reducing bark stripping, branch breaking, and felling by elephants. We assessed 2668 trees – 1352 Sclerocarya birrea (marula), 857 Acacia nigrescens (knobthorn), and 459 Lannea schweinfurthii (false marula) – for elephant impact in the APNR, 1387 (52 %) of which had previously been wrapped in <b>protective</b> <b>wire</b> netting (789, 548 and 50, respectively). Wire netting was effective in reducing the severity of bark stripping and the relative proportion of trees that were bark stripped. In addition, wire netting had an effect on the level of impact, with a higher relative frequency of wire-net-protected trees found in lower impact categories compared with unprotected trees. Since tree mortality has been attributed to high levels of elephant impact, the use of wire netting could serve to maintain individual trees or populations particularly vulnerable to elephant impact in areas with locally high densities of elephants. Conservation implications: Since wire netting is a relatively low cost and ecologically unobtrusive strategy, it could be used to reduce elephant impact in problem areas. This method focuses on protecting trees rather than some other strategies such as environmental manipulation, translocation, contraceptives, and culling that instead focus on reducing elephant numbers.

40|$|Background: Tension-band wiring {{with metal}} wires is a {{commonly}} used technique to treat transverse patella fractures. Wire breakage and migration may potentially cause complications or morbidities such as nerve irritation or skin impingement. The need of extra wound or surgery for implant removal may be required. We hypothesize that the breakage of patellar tension-band wires {{is related to}} the patient's age and the length of time after fracture fixation. Methods: We retrieved and analysed our 11 years records (from January 1, 2000, to May 31, 2011). The inclusion criteria were: (1) patients with transverse patella fracture treated with tension-band plus cerclage wiring technique, (2) with their metal wires removed in our hospital, (3) unilateral patella fracture, (4) wire removal not due to infection, (5) wire removal after complete fracture union, (6) no fracture distal pole or partial patellectomy with <b>protective</b> <b>wire</b> loop, and (7) known exact date of the initial fracture fixation surgery. We reviewed the reasons of wire removal, the presence of broken or migrated wires upon implant removal, and the time lapse from fracture fixation to removal of wire. Results: A total of 59 cases were recruited and studied. A total of 28 patients had intact wires and 31 patients had broken wires upon implant removal. For the age of patients at fracture fixation, there was no statistically significant difference between the intact wire group and the broken wire group. However, for the length of time from fracture fixation to implant removal, the difference was statistically significant between the two groups of patients. It suggested that the risk of wire breakage increases with time after patellar tension-band wiring. If 12 months was used as a cut-off time, there was a statistically significant association between the duration from fracture fixation to implant removal and the presence of broken wire. There were seven cases of wire migration among the 31 patients with broken wires, and two of them needed an extra open wound at popliteal fossa for implant removal. Conclusions: The risk of patellar tension-band wire breakage was associated with increase time lapse from fracture fixation, but not the patients' age upon fracture fixation. The risk of wire breakage significantly increases after 12 months from the fracture fixation. Wire breakage can lead to further morbidities or complications. Routine removal of wire loops may be indicated. Future prospective longitudinal long-term studies may be required...|$|E

Different wires made from different metals and alloys {{are available in the}} market. Although no wire is the best for the entire treatment, they must obey certain properties such as biocompatibility, formability, weldability, low coefficient of friction, resilience, shape memory, low stiffness, and high elastic limit. Even with the buildup of <b>protective</b> layers, <b>wires</b> exposed to the oral environment can suffer corrosion. This gradual destruction of materials resulting from chemical reactions can have several adverse effects such as the release of elements from metals, roughening of the wire surface, and weakening of appliances, which can lead to mechanical failure or even fracture of the orthodontic materials. Corrosion of orthodontic wires is strongly related with the acidic environment of the buccal cavity and the presence of fluoride ions, prophylactic agents, and mouthwash solutions.

40|$|International audienceMultiple input {{multiple}} output (MIMO) {{systems have}} been used for many years in the field of wireless communications. The huge increase in coverage and capacity offered by MIMO technology are the key benefits of using multiple sensors at the transmitter and receiver. Recently, MIMO technology has been applied in the context of power line communications (PLCs), with the aim of offering higher channel capacity and therefore larger system coverage, by including the use of the <b>protective</b> earth (PE) <b>wire</b> in addition to the line (L) and neutral (N) wires. SNR values observed in typical PLC scenarios can be much higher than {{in the case of a}} classical wireless communication.

5|$|Brachytherapy {{contrasts}} with unsealed source radiotherapy, {{in which a}} therapeutic radionuclide (radioisotope) is injected into the body to chemically localize to the tissue requiring destruction. It also contrasts to EBRT, in which high-energy x-rays (or occasionally gamma-rays from a radioisotope like cobalt-60) are directed at the tumour from outside the body. Brachytherapy instead involves the precise placement of short-range radiation-sources (radioisotopes) directly {{at the site of}} the cancerous tumour. These are enclosed in a <b>protective</b> capsule or <b>wire,</b> which allows the ionizing radiation to escape to treat and kill surrounding tissue but prevents the charge of radioisotope from moving or dissolving in body fluids. The capsule may be removed later, or (with some radioisotopes) it may be allowed to remain in place. A feature of brachytherapy is that the irradiation affects only a very localized area around the radiation sources. Exposure to radiation of healthy tissues farther away from the sources is therefore reduced. In addition, if the patient moves or if there is any movement of the tumour within the body during treatment, the radiation sources retain their correct position in relation to the tumour. These characteristics of brachytherapy provide advantages over EBRT – the tumour can be treated with very high doses of localised radiation whilst reducing the probability of unnecessary damage to surrounding healthy tissues.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{evaluate}} resistance to electrochemical corrosion of wire made of Cr-Ni stainless steel, designed for use in endourological treatment. The influence of strain formed in the process of drawing and methods of wire surface preparation to corrosive resistance in artificial urine solution were analysed. Design/methodology/approach: Wire corrosion tests were carried out in the solution of artificial urine {{with the use of the}} system for electrochemical tests VoltaLab®PGP 201. Resistance to electrochemical corrosion was evaluated on the ground of recorded curves of anodic polarization by means of potentiodynamic method. Mechanical properties of wire were tested by means of static uniaxial tension test. Findings: Potentiodynamic tests carried out in artificial urine enabled to determine how the resistance to pitting corrosion of wire changes, depending on strain formed in the drawing process as well as on the method of wire surface preparation. Deterioration of corrosive properties of wire along with the increase in the formed strain hardening was observed. Research limitations/implications: The obtained test results proved the suitability of the applied research methodology for evaluation of electrochemical corrosion resistance of wire made of stainless steel designed for use in endourology. Practical implications: Test results are of significant utilitarian value because they can determine the relation between pitting corrosion resistance and the volume of strain formed in the wire drawing process, and consequently their mechanical properties. Originality/value: The analysis of the results of electrochemical corrosion resistance tests showed positive impact of wire surface treatment by means of electrolytic polishing and chemical passivation method on improvement of its corrosive properties. It must be emphasised that despite the increase in corrosion resistance, obtained thanks to surface treatment, it is necessary to use <b>protective</b> coating on <b>wire</b> used in urology...|$|R

40|$|Balloon {{angioplasty}} or stent implantation {{is one of}} {{the therapeutic}} strategies for treatment of atherosclerosis. However, mechanical denudation of the endothelium and the associated formation of a neointimal lesion are major limitations of these techniques. Injury-induced neointimal hyperplasia can cause a re-narrowing of a dilated artery, called restenosis, and may even be associated with thrombosis in case of an unstable neointimal plaque. Reendothelialization {{plays an important role in}} protecting against injury-induced neointima formation, and chemokines and their receptors are also involved. The Cxcl 12 /Cxcr 4 axis has been reported to mediate the mobilization of SMC progenitors, driving injury-induced neointimal hyperplasia. This study focused on the role of endothelial Cxcr 4 in neointima formation. The effect of an endothelial-specific Cxcr 4 deficiency on neointimal hyperplasia following carotid artery injury was investigated using Cxcr 4 EC-KOApoe-/- mice, in which absence of endothelial Cxcr 4 could be induced by tamoxifen treatment. Endothelial Cxcr 4 deficiency significantly increased neointima formation after wire-induced carotid artery injury in Cxcr 4 EC-KOApoE-/- mice. A higher content of neointimal macrophages was detected in the neointimal lesions, whereas the neointimal SMC and collagen content were decreased. This was associated with a significant reduction in reendothelialization and EC proliferation in injured Cxcr 4 EC-KOApoE-/- carotid arteries compared to Cxcr 4 EC-WTApoE-/- controls. Moreover, in an in vitro scratch assay, treatment of human ECs with CXCL 12 significantly increased their wound-healing capacity, which could be reversed with the CXCR 4 antagonist AMD 3100. Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis revealed a reduced mobilization of circulating Sca 1 +Flk 1 +Cd 31 + and Lin-Sca 1 + progenitors after vascular injury in Cxcr 4 EC-KOApoE-/- mice, although their surface expression of Cxcr 4 was not changed. No difference could be detected in plasma concentrations of Cxcl 12, and also plasma levels of Vegf, S 1 P or Flt 3 -ligand, which are able to mediate progenitor cell mobilization, were unchanged. However, immunofluorescent staining demonstrated a significant reduction of local endothelial Cxcl 12 in injured carotid arteries from Cxcr 4 EC-KOApoE-/- mice. In summary, Cxcr 4 and the Cxcl 12 /Cxcr 4 axis play a <b>protective</b> role in <b>wire</b> injury-induced neointima formation by promoting reendothelialization and mediating EC migration and proliferation to the site of injury, as well as by mediating the mobilization of circulating Sca 1 +Flk 1 +Cd 31 + progenitor cells (often referred to as circulating EPCs) to the periphery. For understanding the role of endothelial Cxcl 12 in mobilization of circulating Sca 1 +Flk 1 +Cd 31 + progenitors, a similar restenosis study in mice lacking specifically endothelial Cxcl 12 is required in future...|$|R
