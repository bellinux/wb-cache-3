30|$|To {{describe}} the model more conveniently, two terminologies are defined here. They are original error Z and <b>propagated</b> <b>error</b> (T− 1 [*]⋅[*]TZ[*]→[*]Y)[*]⋅[*]Z. Original error Z {{is caused by}} many reasons. It includes the random error from physical cause and error caused by attacks from malicious nodes. It also includes the error caused by the rank deficiency of the transfer matrix of the source messages. The terminology of “original error” captures the essence that the error is injected to one link from the outside word. It {{is the equivalent of}} “symbol error” defined in [2]. It is also the equivalent of “corrupted packets” defined in [3] and “erroneous packets” in [4]. Another terminology is <b>propagated</b> <b>error</b> ((T− 1 [*]⋅[*]TZ[*]→[*]Y)[*]⋅[*]Z) which represents the propagated result of the link error in the network coding. Under the influence of the error transfer matrix, the link error is enlarged to the <b>propagated</b> <b>error.</b> The definition of the two terminologies “original error” and “propagated error” are just right necessary.|$|E

30|$|The first note is {{that the}} overall {{information}} rate is very low. The original information is wrapped twice. The inner code is the L 1 optimization, and the outer code is the subspace code.

40|$|Uncertainty {{analysis}} {{is an important}} part of system design. The formula for error propagation through a system model that is most-often cited in literature is based on a first-order Taylor series. This formula makes several important assumptions and has several important limitations that are often ignored. This thesis explores these assumptions and addresses two of the major limitations. First, the results obtained from <b>propagating</b> <b>error</b> through nonlinear systems can be wrong by one or more orders of magnitude, due to the linearization inherent in a first-order Taylor series. This thesis presents a method for over-coming that inaccuracy that is capable of achieving fourth-order accuracy without significant additional computational cost. Second, system designers using a Taylor series to <b>propagate</b> <b>error</b> typically only <b>propagate</b> a mean and variance and ignore all higher-order statistics...|$|R

Especially, in random network coding, the <b>propagated</b> <b>error</b> T̂^- 1 ·T_Z→ Y·(Z-L·x^') [...] always pollutes all the received messages when the coding field is bigger than 7. Thus, we have to face such pessimistic fact and propose an effective method to confront such situation.|$|E

Current implementations handle errors that {{are inherent in}} images in ad hoc ways. This thesis shows that these errors can propagate and magnify through the alignment computations, such that the ad hoc approaches may not work. In addition, a technique is given for tightly bounding the <b>propagated</b> <b>error,</b> {{which can be used}} to make the recognition robust while still being efficient. Further, the error bounds can be used to formally compute the likelihood that a set of hypothesized matches between model and image features is correct. The technique for bounding the <b>propagated</b> <b>error</b> makes use of a new solution to a fundamental problem in computer recognition, namely, the solution for 3 D pose from three corresponding points under weak-perspective projection.

40|$|Abstract—Transmitting video over {{wireless}} is {{a challenging}} problem since video may be seriously distorted due to packet errors caused by wireless channels. The capability of predicting transmission distortion (i. e., video distortion caused by packet errors) {{can assist in}} designing video encoding and transmission schemes that achieve maximum video quality or minimum end-to-end video distortion. This paper is aimed at deriving formulas for predicting transmission distortion. The contribution {{of this paper is}} twofold. First, we identify the governing law that describes how the transmission distortion process evolves over time and analytically derive the transmission distortion formula as a closed-form function of video frame statistics, channel error statistics, and system parameters. Second, we identify, for the first time, two important properties of transmission distortion. The first property is that the clipping noise, which is produced by nonlinear clipping, causes decay of <b>propagated</b> <b>error.</b> The second property is that the correlation between motion-vector concealment error and <b>propagated</b> <b>error</b> is negative and has dominant impact on transmission distortion, compared with other correlations. Due to these two properties and elegant error/distortion decomposition, our formula provides not only more accurate prediction but also lower complexity than the existing methods.

40|$|The {{reliability}} of file systems depends {{in part on}} how well they <b>propagate</b> <b>errors.</b> We develop a static analysis technique, EDP, that analyzes how file systems and storage device drivers <b>propagate</b> <b>error</b> codes. Running our EDP analysis on all file systems and 3 major storage device drivers in Linux 2. 6, we find that errors are often incorrectly propagated; 1153 calls (13 %) drop an error code without handling it. We perform a set of analyses to rank the robustness of each subsystem based on the completeness of its error propagation; we find that many popular file systems are less robust than other available choices. We confirm that write errors are neglected more often than read errors. We also find that many violations are not cornercase mistakes, but perhaps intentional choices. Finally, we show that inter-module calls {{play a part in}} incorrect error propagation, but that chained propagations do not. In conclusion, error propagation appears complex and hard to perform correctly in modern systems. ...|$|R

30|$|Though {{there are}} {{fruitful}} {{works for the}} error-correcting of network coding, {{most of them have}} a fatal drawback that they cannot correct corrupted propagated errors which are dense. As far as we know, all the existing works about NEC have an unrealistic assumption: the number of errors in network coding is bounded by a constant which is less than C. More so, in the situation where the traditional block codes are used, they assume that the number of errors in network coding is smaller than C/ 2. They cannot correct errors beyond dmin/ 2 [*]=[*](C[*]−[*]k)/ 2 [*]<[*]C/ 2 where (C,[*]k) is MDS linear block code with code length C and information length k. Only a few studies refer to the assumption that the number of errors in network coding is bigger than C/ 2. They are list coding in network coding [8, 9] homomorphic signatures [10]. However, homomorphic signatures based on cryptographic approaches can correct the <b>propagated</b> <b>error</b> which equals C. However, cryptographic approaches have great complexity, and it is completely impractical in NEC [10]. Although a novel idea using nonlinear network coding seems a promising method to correct more errors, it cannot solve the problem completely just now and this method needs further being studied [11]. Except homomorphic signatures [10], there is no approach that can cope with <b>propagated</b> <b>error</b> which reaches C.|$|E

40|$|Question: Predictive {{vegetation}} modelling {{relies on}} the use of environmental variables, which are usually derived from a base data set with some level of error, and this error is propagated to any subsequently derived environmental variables. The question for this study is: What is the level of error and uncertainty in environmental variables based on the error propagated from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and how does it vary for both direct and indirect variables? Location: Kioloa region, New South Wales, Australia. Methods: The level of error in a DEM is assessed and used to develop an error model for analysing error propagation to derived environmental variables. We tested both indirect (elevation, slope, aspect, topographic position) and direct (average air temperature, net solar radiation, and topographic wetness index) variables for their robustness to <b>propagated</b> <b>error</b> from the DEM. Results: It is shown that the direct environmental variable net solar radiation is less affected by error in the DEM than the indirect variables aspect and slope, but that regional conditions such as slope steepness and cloudiness can influence this outcome. However, the indirect environmental variable topographic position was less affected by error in the DEM than topographic wetness index. Interestingly, the results disagreed with the current assumption that indirect variables are necessarily less sensitive to <b>propagated</b> <b>error</b> because they are less derived. Conclusions: The results indicate that variables exhibit both systematic bias and instability under uncertainty. There is a clear need to consider the sensitivity of variables to error in their base data sets in addition {{to the question of whether}} to use direct or indirect variables...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Remotely sensed {{reflectance}} spectra may {{be biased}} by several intervening factors, and the biases are propagated into estimations of {{the fraction of}} vegetation cover (FVC) by algorithms based on a linear mixture model (LMM). The <b>errors</b> <b>propagated</b> in FVCs depend on the retrieval algorithm used, {{due to differences in}} the assumptions of the model as well as constraints employed in the algorithm. These differences should be fully understood prior to algorithm selection for practical applications. Although numerous studies have investigated the relationships between <b>errors</b> <b>propagated</b> by different algorithms, these relationships have not been fully understood from a deterministic perspective. This study introduces a technique for deriving the analytical underpinnings of error propagation in FVC based on several LMM-based algorithms. The derivation assumes that measurement noise is band-correlated additive noise. The bias <b>errors</b> <b>propagated</b> in FVC depended on the endmember spectra assumed in the algorithm, the target spectrum, and the coefficients of the spectral vegetation index, which were employed as constraints, as well as magnitude of the input error.
