The {{purpose of this study}} was to {{determine}} the prevalence and risk factors causing lower back pain in the anesthesiology workplace at Dr. Hasan Sadikin Hospital General Bandung. This research is a descriptive study with cross-sectional design. Subjects on this research were the anesthesiology residents and consultants in Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital Bandung between April and June 2014. Data analysis was performed by chi-square, Exact Fisher and Kolmogorov Smirnov. The results showed that the prevalence of lower back pain that arises after entering the anesthesiology workplace in Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital Bandung was 37. 5 %. The significant risk factors were smoking (RR 1. 348) and lack of exercise (RR 80. 04) while the <b>position</b> <b>factor</b> during conducting anesthesia did not significantly cause lower back pain.

Here we sought to track {{the time course of}} this discrimination and to determine how orthographic information [...] letter position and letter identity [...] is computed during reading. We used a go/no-go lexical decision task while recording event-related potentials (ERPs). Subjects were presented with single words (go trials) and pseudowords (no-go trials), which varied in orthographic conformation, presenting either a double consonant frequently doubled (i. e., "ss") or never doubled (i. e., "zz") (identity factor); and a position of the double consonant was which either legal or illegal (<b>position</b> <b>factor),</b> in a 2 x 2 factorial design. Words and pseudowords clearly differed as early as 230 msec. At this latency, ERP waveforms were modulated both by the identity and by the position of letters: The fronto-central no-go N 2 was the smallest in amplitude and peaked the earliest to pseudowords presenting both an illegal double-letter position and an identity never encountered. At this stage, the two factors showed additive effects, suggesting an independent coding. The factors of identity and position of double letters interacted much later in the process, at the P 3 level, around 300 - 400 msec on frontal and central sites, in line with the lexical decision data obtained in the behavioral study. Overall, these results show that the speed of lexical decision may depend on orthographic information coded independently by the identity and position of letters in a word...|$|E
40|$|SummaryIntroductionAssessment of soft-tissue {{balance by}} the gap {{technique}} in Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) impacts femoral component rotation positioning. Proper femoral component rotation {{is a critical}} factor in TKA, both for adequate patellar tracking and in achieving a symmetrical flexion gap. Soft tissue balance assessment and gap measurements are performed at 90 ° flexion and with the patella everted in conventional TKA; during MIS-TKA, this step is performed with the patella in situ. We therefore investigated intraoperative joint gap parameters at 90 ° flexion with and without patellar eversion during conventional TKA, so as to better understand the influence of this intraoperative patellar <b>position</b> <b>factor</b> on final ligament balance. HypothesisConducting TKA without patellar eversion increases both gap size and gap inclination. Patients and methodsTwenty-four osteoarthritic knees were included in the study. Joint gap size and inclination were measured intraoperatively on a knee in 90 ° flexion, with and without patellar eversion. ResultsThe joint gap with patella in situ (17. 0 ± 3. 4  mm) was significantly greater than with patellar eversion (15. 4 ± 3. 0  mm), as was gap inclination at 90 ° flexion with the patella in situ (4. 9 ± 3. 1 °) compared to with patellar eversion (4. 0 ± 2. 9 °). DiscussionThe flexion gap inclination obtained without patellar eversion was steeper than with patellar eversion. This induced more externally rotated femoral positioning in absence of patellar eversion. These results ought {{to be taken into account}} by surgeons considering switching from conventional to MIS-TKA. Level of evidenceLevel III. Prospective study...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} changes in upper lip and lower lip {{integrated}} electromyographic (IEMG) amplitude and temporal measures related to linguistic factors {{known for their}} influence on stuttering were investigated. Nonstuttering subjects first read and then verbalized sentences of varying length (sentence length factor), in which meaningless but phonologically appropriate character strings were varied in their position within the sentence (word <b>position</b> <b>factor)</b> and their size (word size factor). It was hypothesized that the production of stressed, vowel-rounding gestures of words in initial position, longer words, and words in longer sentences would be characterized by specific changes in IEMG amplitude that would reflect an increase in speech motor demands, intuitively defined as articulatory effort. Basically, the findings corroborated our assumptions, showing that words in sentence initial position have shorter word and vowel durations in combination {{with an increase in}} IEMG activity. Similarly, we found shorter vowel durations for longer words, and in sentence final position an increase in IEMG activity. For longer sentences we found a clear increase in speech rate, but contrary to our expectations a decrease in IEMG activity. It was speculated that this might relate to the use of a movement reduction strategy to allow higher speech rates with increased coarticulation. These findings were discussed both for their implications in normal speech production, as well as for their possible implications for explaining stuttering behavior. To this end our data can illustrate both why stutterers might run a higher risk of stuttering at these linguistic loci of stuttering, and why they might come up with a strategic solution to decrease the motor demands in speech production. The basic outcome of this study shows that higher order (linguistic) specifications can have clear effects on speech motor production...|$|E

40|$|Structural asymmetries between {{countries}} - understood as those which originate from differences in economic size, geographical <b>position,</b> <b>factor</b> endowments, access to regional infrastructure, institutional quality {{and level of}} development - constitute {{one of the main}} challenges to the regional integration process promoted by Mercosur. The greater size and diversification of the Brazilian economy relative to those of {{the other members of the}} bloc (and above all Uruguay and Paraguay) render the common external tariff of Mercosur a reflection of the tariff structure and commercial interests of Brazil, thereby undermining the creation of a complete customs union. Furthermore, they also reduce the possibilities of creating supranational institutions, or at least institutions less vulnerable to changes in national governments. This paper presents indicators of structural asymmetries in Mercosur and analyses the policies adopted to compensate for such asymmetries. It offers evidence that, despite its greater and more diversified economy, Brazil falls behind both Argentina and Uruguay with respect to per capita income and indicators of human development and socio-economic inequality. Moreover, Brazilian subnational regions are the least developed in Mercosur, and Brazil has not played the role of buyer of last resort in the process of regional integration, presenting generally surpluses with its trade partners in the bloc. The Structural Convergence Fund of Mercosur (known by the Portuguese acronym Focem) is crucial though insufficient for the compensation of structural asymmetries within Mercosur. Proposals for improving and expanding Focem are presented, notably those that defend the eligibility of projects from the private sector, the employment of more technical rather than political criteria in the selection of these projects, the provision of assistance for the elaboration of projects in smaller countries, greater transparency in the allocation of resources and in the announcement of the project results, and, finally, the use of the Fund to promote macroeconomic harmonization as well as social cohesion in the least developed subnational regions...|$|E
