5|$|Public {{attitudes towards}} feral cats vary widely, ranging from seeing them as free-ranging pets, to {{regarding}} them as vermin. One common approach to reducing the feral cat population is termed 'trap-neuter-return', where the cats are trapped, neutered, immunized against {{diseases such as}} rabies and the feline <b>Panleukopenia</b> and Leukemia viruses, and then released. Before releasing them back into their feral colonies, the attending veterinarian often nips the tip off one ear to mark it as neutered and inoculated, since these cats may be trapped again. Volunteers continue to feed and give care to these cats throughout their lives. Given this support, their lifespans are increased, and behavior and nuisance problems caused by competition for food are reduced.|$|E

25|$|Previously it {{has been}} thought that the virus does not undergo cross species infection. However studies in Vietnam have shown that CPV2 can undergo minor {{antigenic}} shift and natural mutation to infect felids. Analyses of feline parvovirus (FPV) isolates in Vietnam and Taiwan revealed that more than 80% of the isolates were of the canine parvovirus type, rather than feline <b>panleukopenia</b> virus (FPLV). CPV2 may spread to cats easier than dogs and undergo faster rates of mutation within that species.|$|E
25|$|Canine {{parvovirus}} type 2 (CPV2, colloquially parvo) is a contagious virus mainly affecting dogs, {{and thought}} to originate in cats. The current {{consensus is that}} the feline <b>panleukopenia</b> mutated into CPV2. Parvo is highly contagious and is spread from dog to dog by direct or indirect contact with their feces. Vaccines can prevent this infection, but mortality can reach 91% in untreated cases. Treatment often involves veterinary hospitalization. Canine parvovirus may infect other mammals including foxes, wolves, cats, and skunks; however, it will not infect humans.|$|E
25|$|Domestic kittens in {{developed}} societies are usually vaccinated against common illnesses {{from two to}} three months of age. The usual combination vaccination protects against feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR), feline calicivirus (C), and feline <b>panleukopenia</b> (P). This FVRCP inoculation is usually given at eight, twelve, and sixteen weeks, and an inoculation against rabies may be given at sixteen weeks. Kittens are usually spayed or neutered at seven months of age, but kittens may be neutered as young as seven weeks (if large enough), especially in animal shelters. Such early neutering {{does not appear to have}} any long-term health risks to cats, and may even be beneficial in male cats. Kittens are commonly wormed against roundworms from about four weeks.|$|E
2500|$|Vaccinations are an {{important}} preventative animal health measure. The specific vaccinations recommended for cats varies depending on geographic location, environment, travel history, and the activities the animal frequently engages in. In the United States, regardless {{of any of these}} factors, it is usually highly recommended that cats be vaccinated against rabies, feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1), feline calicivirus (FCV), and feline <b>panleukopenia</b> virus (FPV). [...] The decision on whether to vaccinate against other diseases should be made between an owner and a veterinarian, taking into account factors specific to the cat.|$|E
2500|$|Parvovirus CPV2 is a {{relatively}} new disease that appeared in the late 1970s. It was first recognized in 1978 and spread worldwide in one to two years. The virus is very similar to feline <b>panleukopenia</b> (also a parvovirus); they are 98% identical, differing only in two amino acids in the viral capsid protein VP2. It is also highly similar to mink enteritis, and the parvoviruses of raccoons and foxes. [...] It is possible that CPV2 is a mutant of an unidentified parvovirus (similar to feline parvovirus (FPV)) of some wild carnivore. A strain of CPV2b (strain FP84) has been shown to cause disease in a small percentage of domestic cats, although vaccination for FPV seems to be protective. CPV2, however, does not cause disease in cats and does so only mildly in mink and raccoons, and is a virus almost exclusively affecting canines.|$|E

50|$|Feline <b>panleukopenia</b> {{requires}} {{aggressive treatment}} if {{the cat is}} to survive, as this disease can kill cats in less than 24 hours. Treatment involves whole blood transfusion to improve pancytopenia, intravenous fluids as most cats are dehydrated, injections of vitamins A, B, and C, IV antibiotics to prevent septicemia, which develops in most cats with feline <b>panleukopenia</b> if antibiotics are not used, and hospitalization.|$|E

5000|$|Feline <b>panleukopenia</b> virus (FPV), {{also known}} as feline {{infectious}} enteritis, feline parvoviral enteritis, feline distemper, feline ataxia, or cat plague, [...] is a viral infection affecting cats, both domesticated and wild feline species. It is caused by feline parvovirus, a close relative of both type 2 canine parvovirus and mink enteritis. Once contracted, it is highly contagious and can be fatal to the affected cat. The name <b>panleukopenia</b> comes from the low {{white blood cell count}} (leucocytes) exhibited by affected animals.|$|E
50|$|The Second ICTV Report, {{published}} in 1976, established the family Parvoviridae, which {{at that time}} included three genera, one of which retained the name Parvovirus and contained all of the aforementioned viruses plus feline <b>panleukopenia</b> virus (now called feline parvovirus, abbreviated to FPV), which had been shown to cause epidemics of enteritis, <b>panleukopenia</b> and congenital cerebellar ataxia in domestic cats. In 1978 a virus from the same species as FPV emerged that was able to infect dogs (called canine parvovirus or CPV), which rapidly spread globally, causing pandemics of severe intestinal and coronary disease.|$|E

50|$|If a cat {{is exposed}} during pregnancy, the virus can cause {{cerebellar}} hypoplasia in her offspring. This is why administering modified live feline <b>panleukopenia</b> vaccine during pregnancy is discouraged. Feline panleukopaenia and canine parvovirus are extremely closely related, but viruses cannot be transmitted between dogs and cats.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{bacterial}} infections and viral infections such as feline <b>panleukopenia,</b> caused by feline parvovirus (while in utero), {{that can result}} in the disorder in both cats and dogs. The disease can also be caused by malnutrition, poisoning, injury or general accidents during development in the fetus.|$|E
50|$|Complications {{are quite}} common in feline <b>panleukopenia</b> FPL. The most {{prevalent}} one is dehydration, which develops {{in almost all}} FPL-infected cats that are clinically ill. Hyponatremia and other electrolyte disturbances are also quite common, as is hypotension, hyperpyrexia or, late in the disease, hypothermia. The patients' severe leukocytopenia predispose them to secondary infections, especially bacterial and fungal, though secondary viral infections also occur with some frequency. Disseminated intravascular coagulation may also occur, and is often fatal. Extreme thrombocytopenia may also occur, {{and can lead to}} severe hemorrhagic complications. Even if a cat survives acute FPL, late complications such as cardiomyopathy and myocarditis can occur, though there have never been any reported cases of hematologic or gastrointestinal sequalae, and it seems that late myocarditis or cardiomyopathy is extremely rare in feline panleukopenia-affected cats. Overall, any long-term sequalae in survivors of feline <b>panleukopenia</b> is extremely rare, with almost all cats who survive making a full recovery.|$|E
5000|$|The virus {{primarily}} {{attacks the}} lining of the gastrointestinal tract, causing internal ulceration and, ultimately, total sloughing of the intestinal epithelium. This results in profuse and usually bloody diarrhea, severe dehydration, malnutrition, anemia, and often death. It causes a decrease in the cat's white blood cells, thus compromising its immune system. Typically, it also causes a decrease in hematocrit and platelet counts on a complete blood count. This is often key in diagnosing <b>panleukopenia.</b> Other symptoms include depression, lethargy, loss of appetite, fever, vomiting, loss of skin elasticity due to dehydration, and self-biting in the tail, lower back and back legs. Affected cats may sit for hours at their water bowl, although they may not drink much. Terminal cases are hypothermic and may develop septic shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation. [...] Most <b>panleukopenia</b> deaths are due to secondary infections or dehydration resulting from diarrhea. This is because the virus affects the infected cat's immune system, leaving it vulnerable to secondary infection.|$|E
5000|$|Protection {{is offered}} by {{commercial}} feline distemper vaccines (ATCvet codes: [...] for the inactivated viral vaccine and [...] for the live vaccine). A number of combination vaccines for several different diseases, including <b>panleukopenia,</b> are also available. Because of the serious disease and ubiquity of the virus vaccination is recommended for every cat. Even cats kept indoors can be infected since the virus is so stable {{that it can be}} transmitted on fomites.|$|E

50|$|<b>Panleukopenia</b> is {{primarily}} spread through {{contact with an}} infected animal's bodily fluids, feces, or other fomites, {{as well as by}} fleas. It may be spread to and by cats, minks and ferrets and can be spread long distances through contact with bedding, food dishes, or even by clothing and shoes of handlers of infected animals. It is not, however, contagious or contractable by humans. Like all parvoviruses, FPV is extremely resistant to inactivation and can survive for longer than one year in a suitable environment.|$|E

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1950s, cats brought to Marion Island, one of the Prince Edward Islands, to deal with a mouse problem in the local meteorological station, went out of growth control. Starting from the first five domestic cats introduced on the island on 1949, there were about 3,400 cats in 1977, feeding on the burrowing petrels instead of the mice, threatening to drive the birds to extinction. A cat eradication program was set up and a few cats were intentionally infected with the <b>panleukopenia</b> virus, which reduced the number of cats to about 600 by 1982.|$|E

50|$|The {{wildlife}} {{is particularly}} vulnerable to introduced species and the historical problem has been with cats and mice.

The cats multiplied quickly, and by 1977 there were approximately 3,400 cats on the island, feeding on burrowing petrels in addition to mice, and taking an estimated 455,000 petrels a year. Some species of petrels soon disappeared from Marion Island, and a cat eradication programme was established. A few cats were intentionally infected with the highly specific feline <b>panleukopenia</b> virus, which reduced the cat population to about 600 by 1982. The remaining cats were killed by nocturnal shooting, and in 1991 only eight cats were trapped in a 12-month period.|$|E
