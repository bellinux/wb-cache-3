5|$|Methoxyflurane is an {{extremely}} potent and highly lipid-soluble anesthetic agent, characterized by very slow induction (onset of action) and emergence (offset or dissipation) times. It is non-flammable, has relatively mild hemodynamic effects, {{and it does not}} predispose the heart to rhythm disturbances. It is, however, a significant respiratory depressant. Methoxyflurane has powerful analgesic (pain-relieving) properties at well below full anesthetic doses. It was utilized in self-administration devices for obstetric analgesia, in a manner that foreshadowed the <b>patient-controlled</b> <b>analgesia</b> infusion pumps of today.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Robert Wexler of Abbott Laboratories {{developed}} the Analgizer, a disposable inhaler {{that allowed the}} self-administration of methoxyflurane vapor in air for analgesia. The Analgizer consisted of a polyethylene cylinder 5inches long and 1inch in diameter with a 1inch long mouthpiece. The device contained a rolled wick of polypropylene felt which held 15milliliters of methoxyflurane. Because of {{the simplicity of the}} Analgizer and the pharmacological characteristics of methoxyflurane, it was easy for patients to self-administer the drug and rapidly achieve a level of conscious analgesia which could be maintained and adjusted as necessary {{over a period of time}} lasting from a few minutes to several hours. The 15milliliter supply of methoxyflurane would typically last for two to three hours, during which time the user would often be partly amnesic to the sense of pain; the device could be refilled if necessary. The Analgizer was found to be safe, effective, and simple to administer in obstetric patients during childbirth, as well as for patients with bone fractures and joint dislocations, and for dressing changes on burn patients. When used for labor analgesia, the Analgizer allows labor to progress normally and with no apparent adverse effect on Apgar scores. All vital signs remain normal in obstetric patients, newborns, and injured patients. The Analgizer was widely utilized for analgesia and sedation until the early 1970s, in a manner that foreshadowed the <b>patient-controlled</b> <b>analgesia</b> infusion pumps of today. The Analgizer inhaler was withdrawn in 1974, but use of methoxyflurane as a sedative and analgesic continues in Australia and New Zealand in the form of the Penthrox inhaler. Trials of methoxyflurane as an analgesic in emergency medicine are going on in the UK.|$|E
25|$|Opioids {{are safe}} and {{effective}} at providing pain control in patients with acute pancreatitis. Adequate pain control {{requires the use of}} intravenous opiates, usually {{in the form of a}} <b>patient-controlled</b> <b>analgesia</b> pump. Hydromorphone or fentanyl (intravenous) may be used for pain relief in acute pancreatitis. Fentanyl is being increasingly used due to its better safety profile, especially in renal impairment. As with other opiates, fentanyl can depress respiratory function. It can be given both as a bolus as well as constant infusion.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the neurological protective effect in elderly spinal surgery {{patients who received}} dexmedetomidine combined with sufentanil for <b>patient-controlled</b> intravenous <b>analgesia.</b> Methods: A total of 130 elderly patients who received spinal surgery in our hospital were selected as the research subjects and randomly divided into observation group and control group. Observation group received postoperative dexmedetomidine (1. 5 μg/kg) combined with sufentanil (1 μg/kg) for <b>patient-controlled</b> intravenous <b>analgesia,</b> and control group received sufentanil (3 μg/kg) alone for <b>patient-controlled</b> intravenous <b>analgesia.</b> Differences in postoperative neuroendocrine, autonomic nervous function, cellular immune function, etc. were compared between two groups at different analgesia points in time. Results: Neuroendocrine factors such as GIU, ACTH, Cor and Ins levels in circulation, and heart rate variability indexes such as LF, HF and LF/HF values of observation group after postoperative <b>patient-controlled</b> intravenous <b>analgesia</b> were {{lower than those of}} control group at corresponding points in time (P< 0. 05); cellular immunity indexes such as CD 3 +, CD 4 +, CD 4 +/ CD 8 + and NK cell values in circulation were higher than those of control group at corresponding points in time (P< 0. 05).

25|$|Most {{people with}} sickle-cell disease have {{intensely}} painful episodes called vaso-occlusive crises. However, the frequency, severity, {{and duration of}} these crises vary tremendously. Painful crises are treated symptomatically with pain medications; pain management requires opioid administration at regular intervals until the crisis has settled. For milder crises, a subgroup of patients manage on NSAIDs (such as diclofenac or naproxen). For more severe crises, most patients require inpatient management for intravenous opioids; <b>patient-controlled</b> <b>analgesia</b> (PCA) devices are commonly used in this setting. Diphenhydramine is also an effective agent that doctors frequently prescribe to help control itching {{associated with the use}} of opioids.|$|E
25|$|The vaso-occlusive {{crisis is}} caused by sickle-shaped red blood cells that obstruct {{capillaries}} and restrict blood flow to an organ resulting in ischaemia, pain, necrosis, and often organ damage. The frequency, severity, and duration of these crises vary considerably. Painful crises are treated with hydration, analgesics, and blood transfusion; pain management requires opioid administration at regular intervals until the crisis has settled. For milder crises, a subgroup of patients manage on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as diclofenac or naproxen. For more severe crises, most patients require inpatient management for intravenous opioids; <b>patient-controlled</b> <b>analgesia</b> devices are commonly used in this setting. Vaso-occlusive crisis involving organs such as the penis or lungs are considered an emergency and treated with red-blood cell transfusions.

40|$|PURPOSE: In modern obstetrics, {{different}} pharmacological and non-pharmacological options {{allow to}} obtain pain relief during labour, {{one of the}} most important goals in women satisfaction about medical care. The aim of this review is to compare all the analgesia administration schemes in terms of effectiveness in pain relief, length of labour, mode of delivery, side effects and neonatal outcomes. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in electronic databases in the interval time between January 1999 and March 2013. Key search terms included: "labour analgesia", "epidural anaesthesia during labour" (excluding anaesthesia for Caesarean section), "epidural analgesia and labour outcome" and "intra-thecal analgesia". RESULTS: 10, 331 patients were analysed: 5, 578 patients underwent Epidural-Analgesia, 259 patients spinal analgesia, 2, 724 combined spinal epidural analgesia, 322 continuous epidural infusion (CEI), 168 intermittent epidural bolus, 684 <b>patient-controlled</b> infusion epidural <b>analgesia</b> and 152 intra-venous <b>patient-controlled</b> epidural <b>analgesia.</b> We also considered 341 women who underwent <b>patient-controlled</b> infusion epidural <b>analgesia</b> in association with CEI and 103 patients who underwent <b>patient-controlled</b> infusion epidural <b>analgesia</b> in association with automatic mandatory bolus. CONCLUSION: No significant differences occurred among all the available administration schemes of neuraxial analgesia. In absence of obstetrical contraindication, neuraxial analgesia has to be considered as the gold standard in obtaining maternal pain relief during labour. The options available in the administration of analgesia should be known and evaluated together by both gynaecologists and anaesthesiologists to choose the best personalized scheme and obtain the best women satisfaction. Since it is difficult to identify comparable circumstances during labour, it is complicate to standardize drugs schemes and their combinations...|$|R
2500|$|Pain {{management}} is classified into either pre-emptive or on-demand. [...] On-demand pain medications typically include either opioid or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs {{but can also}} make use of novel approaches such as inhaled nitrous oxide or ketamine. [...] On demand drugs can be administered by a clinician ("as needed drug orders") or by the patient using <b>patient-controlled</b> <b>analgesia</b> (PCA). [...] PCA {{has been shown to}} provide slightly better pain control and increased patient satisfaction when compared with conventional methods. [...] Common preemptive approaches include epidural neuraxial blockade or nerve blocks. [...] One review which looked at pain control after abdominal aortic surgery found that epidural blockade provides better pain relief (especially during movement) in the period up to three postoperative days. It reduces the duration of postoperative tracheal intubation by roughly half. The occurrence of prolonged postoperative mechanical ventilation and myocardial infarction is also reduced by epidural analgesia.|$|E
