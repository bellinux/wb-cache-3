40|$|Abstract. Some {{aspects of}} the ecology of 93 waterbird species, found {{predominantly}} on freshwater ecosystems, are reviewed. These species, belonging to six major orders — Anseriformes (ducks, geese and Black Swan), <b>Podicipediformes</b> (grebes), Pelecaniformes (Australian Pelican and cormorants), Ciconiiformes (herons, ibis, spoonbills and bitterns), Gruiformes (cranes, rails, crakes and gallinules), and Charadriiformes (waders and terns) — use {{a wide range of}} habitats and about half occur throughout the continent. Knowledge of their ecology remains poor for many waterbirds, particularly cryptic and rare species, and is moderate to good for hunted species. Life histories of Australian waterbirds differ from their counterparts elsewhere. Australia’s highly variable climate and river-flooding patterns create wetland habitats, the spatial and temporal variability of which strongly influence the ecology of local waterbirds. Many waterbirds respond to newly generated habitats to feed and/or breed and then disperse or die as wetlands dry. Regular movements are not common in most Australian species although some, particularly waders, migrate between Northern Hemisphere breeding grounds and non-breeding habitat in Australia. Breeding of Australian waterbirds coincides with food abundance in the southern spring, the wet season in the tropics and following floods inland. Habitat loss through draining of wetlands, regulation of rivers, diversion of water for irrigation and floodplain development are currently the major threats to waterbirds. Other potentiall...|$|E
40|$|Within the microsporidian genus Encephalitozoon, three species, Encephalitozoon cuniculi, Encephalitozoon hellem and Encephalitozoon intestinalis {{have been}} described. Several {{orders of the}} Class Aves (Passeriformes, Psittaciformes, Apodiformes, Ciconiiformis, Gruiformes, Columbiformes, Suliformes, <b>Podicipediformes,</b> Anseriformes, Struthioniformes, Falconiformes) and of the Class Mammalia (Rodentia, Lagomorpha, Primates, Artyodactyla, Soricomorpha, Chiroptera, Carnivora) can become infected. Especially E.  cuniculi has a very broad host range while E.  hellem is mainly {{distributed}} amongst birds. E.  intestinalis {{has so far been}} detected only sporadically in wild animals. Although genotyping allows the identification of strains with a certain host preference, recent studies have demonstrated that they have no strict host specificity. Accordingly, humans can become infected with any of the four strains of E.  cuniculi as well as with E.  hellem or E.  intestinalis, the latter being the most common. Especially, but not exclusively, immunocompromised people are at risk. Environmental contamination with as well as direct transmission of Encephalitozoon is therefore highly relevant for public health. Moreover, endangered species might be threatened by the spread of pathogens into their habitats. In captivity, clinically overt and often fatal disease seems to occur frequently. In conclusion, Encephalitozoon appears to be common in wild warm-blooded animals and these hosts may present important reservoirs for environmental contamination and maintenance of the pathogens. Similar to domestic animals, asymptomatic infections seem to occur frequently but in captive wild animals severe disease has also been reported. Detailed investigations into the epidemiology and clinical relevance of these microsporidia will permit a full appraisal of their role as pathogens...|$|E
40|$|Populations of Houbara Bustards have {{dramatically}} declined in recent years. Captive breeding and reintroduction programs have had limited success in reviving population numbers and thus new technological solutions involving molecular methods {{are essential for}} the long term survival of this species. In this study, we sequenced the 694 bp segment of COI gene of the four specimens of Asian Houbara Bustard (Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii). We also compared these sequences with earlier published barcodes of 11 individuals comprising different families of the orders Gruiformes, Ciconiiformes, <b>Podicipediformes</b> and Crocodylia (out group). The pair-wise sequence comparison showed a total of 254 variable sites across all the 15 sequences from different taxa. Three of the four specimens of Houbara Bustard had an identical sequence of COI gene and one individual showed a single nucleotide difference (G > A transition at position 83). Within the bustard family (Otididae), comparison among the three species (Asian Houbara Bustard, Great Bustard (Otis tarda) and the Little Bustard (Tetrax tetrax)), representing three different genera, showed 116 variable sites. For another family (Rallidae), the intra-family variable sites among the individuals of four different genera were found to be 146. The COI genetic distances among the 15 individuals varied from 0. 000 to 0. 431. Phylogenetic analysis using 619 bp nucleotide segment of COI clearly discriminated all the species representing different genera, families and orders. All the four specimens of Houbara Bustard formed a single clade and are clearly separated from other two individuals of the same family (Otis tarda and Tetrax tetrax). The nucleotide sequence of partial segment of COI gene effectively discriminated the closely related species. This is the first study reporting the barcodes of Houbara Bustard and would be helpful in future molecular studies, particularly for the conservation of this threatened bird in Saudi Arabia...|$|E

Our multi-disciplinary study is the first to reveal that the phoenicopteriform reproductive behaviour, nesting ecology and nest characteristics derived from grebe-like type strategies to reach the extremely specialized conditions observed in modern flamingo crown groups. Furthermore, our study enables us to map ecological and reproductive characters on the Phoenicopteriformes evolutionary lineage. Our results demonstrate that the nesting paleoenvironments of flamingos were closely linked to the unique ecology of this locality, which is a direct result of special climatic (high evaporitic regime) and geological (fault system) conditions.

40|$|Kidney {{volume and}} the volume {{proportions}} of the cortex, medulla, blood vessels larger than capillaries and ureter and ureteral ducts were investigated in 61 birds from 14 species representing passeriformes, psittaciformes, <b>podicipediformes,</b> anseriformes, galliformes, and columbiformes. The kidneys were fixed in situ by perfusion via their arterial supply. Kidney volume and body weight were strongly correlated (r = 0. 991); the allometric function relating kidney volume (Vk) to body weight (W) was: Vk = 13. 96 W 0. 902. Histological sections of one kidney from each bird were analysed by point counting with a Zeiss integrating eyepiece to estimate the volume proportions and subsequently the absolute volumes of {{the main components of}} the kidney. The avian kidney was found to consist of a very large cortex (range 71 - 81 %), a relatively small medulla (range 5 - 15 %), blood vessels larger than capillaries (range 10 - 13 %). For all the birds, the mean volume {{proportions of the}} kidney components were as follows: cortex, 77 %; medulla, 10 %; blood vessels larger than capillaries, 12 %; ureter and ureteral ducts, 1 %. The values for the absolute volume of each of the main components of the kidney were well correlated with body weight. The allometric equations and correlation coefficients (r) relating: (a) the volume of cortex (Vc) and the body weight (W) was Vc = 10. 06 W 0. 914, r = 0. 991; (b) the volume of medulla (Vm) and body weight was Vm = 2. 27 W 0. 795, r = 0. 974; (c) the volume of blood vessels larger than capillaries (Vb) and body weight was Vb = 1. 76 W 0. 894, r = 0. 988. All the birds were divided into two groups in the following five sets: (a) passeriform and non-passeriform orders; (b) galliform and non-galliform orders; (c) small and large birds weighing less than and more than 500 g respectively; (d) aquatic and non-aquatic birds; (e) desert and non-desert birds. In the two groups of each set the differences between kidney volume per gram body weight and those between the respective percentage proportions of cortex, medulla and blood vessels larger than capillaries were assessed by Student's t-test. The differences between kidney volume per gram body weight were significant for all sets except desert and non-desert birds; those between the respective percentage proportions of cortex and medulla were significant for all sets; those between the percentage proportions of blood vessels larger than capillaries were significant only in desert and non-desert birds.

40|$|Avian {{influenza}} viruses (AIV) are {{prevalent in}} birds, several mammals and in humans. Low pathogenic AIV (LPAIV) of subtypes H 5 and H 7 can become highly pathogenic {{due to the}} high frequency of mutation. Certain virus strains have zoonotic potential. Infections with highly pathogenic AIV (HPAIV) of subtype H 5 N 1 have caused hundreds of cases of illness and deaths in humans in recent years. LPAIV are widely distributed among wild birds, especially wild waterfowl. However, since {{the emergence of the}} HPAIV subtype H 5 N 1 in the year 2005, numerous infections have occurred in wild birds, with different susceptibility of certain species. Although the role of wild birds in HPAIV is still controversial, this host reservoir poses a risk for AIV infections to occur among commercial poultry which then results in extensive epizootic disease control activities and enormous economic consequences. Besides HPAIV infections, it is also mandatory to control LPAIV infections of subtypes H 5 and H 7 throughout Europe. To acquire data for risk assessment, first voluntary and later obligatory specifications for monitoring the prevalence of AIV in wild birds were developed. According to refined risk assessment certain species, especially of the orders Anseriformes and Charadriformes, were preferentially included in the monitoring program. Through implementation of these specifications wild bird monitoring was performed in the federal state of Brandenburg. This work evaluates the resulting data from the period of 2006 to 2010. In total, 8. 290 wild birds of 139 domestic species and 43 families have been examined for AIV by testing organs from bird remains, pharyngeal or cloacae swabs as well as excrement. The largest fraction of the investigated species were geese and ducks (Anseriformes) forming 35 % of total. 21 birds, predominantly swans, tested positive for HPAIV subtype H 5 N 1 infection with the “Asia” strain in combination with Europe-wide outbreaks of the virus in wild birds during spring-time 2006. Subsequently, there was no further evidence for HPAIV infection in the federal state of Brandenburg. During the period of five years (2006 - 2010) 90 cases of LPAIV have been diagnosed, among them the subtypes H 5 and H 7. The species with the highest prevalence was Mallard followed by Eurasian Coot. Orders with LPAIV infections have been Anseriformes, <b>Podicipediformes</b> (Grebes), Gruiformes (cranes and relatives), Accipitriformes (raptors) und Strigiformes (owls). Significant differences in the distribution pattern of LPAIV have been detected within individual years and between different years, as well as differences in geographic distribution. Numbers of AIV infections showed a peak in late summer to early winter, especially in the Ramsar Site Peitzer Teiche located in the administrative district Spree-Neiße. The wild bird monitoring was completed by the investigation of Mallards (Anas plathyrhynchos) which were kept in a facility at the Lake Felchowsee in the administrative district Uckermark. These sentinel animals lived in a permanent contact with the local wild birds for the period of October 2008 to October 2010. A sampling of the sentinels was performed every two weeks by taking swabs for AIV detection and every four weeks with blood tests for AIV antibody detection. Compared to the comprehensive wild bird monitoring, the detection rate among the sentinels was significantly higher and several subtypes were detected. AIV antibodies were found in the Mallards two weeks after beginning testing with a positive serological response lasting from two weeks to several months. However, the subtype specificity of the antibodies (H 7) could only be determined for a single animal by hemagglutination inhibition reaction. From the wild bird monitoring an overview of the AIV prevalence in the federal state of Brandenburg could be achieved. However, for some species the number of investigated animals was not sufficient to confirm AIV infection’s significance in certain months and areas. Examination of data clearly shows that sampling of carcasses (passive monitoring) is superior to sampling of live animals (active monitoring) in confirmation of HPAIV infection in wild birds. However, active monitoring seems to be more suitable for the detection of LPAIV. Focusing on certain species (Mallard, Eurasian Coot), certain areas (wetlands, especially Lakes Peitzer Teiche and Lakes Havelseen), certain months (September, October and January to March) and a certain sampling specification (hunted Mallards) could increase efficiency of surveillance. Sentinel facilities seem to provide a cost-efficient alternative to conventional monitoring in order to provide data, including serology, to follow the course of AIV infections over long time periods in a particular ecosystem...|$|E
