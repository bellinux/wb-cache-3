60|$|Nevertheless, it was, beyond question, this noisome {{confinement}} in so close, unventilated, {{and crowded}} a den: joined to the deprivation of sufficient food, from which many were suffering; which, helped by their <b>personal</b> <b>uncleanliness,</b> brought on a malignant fever.|$|E
60|$|Some days after, one of {{the boys}} of the mizzen-top was flogged for drunkenness, and, while {{suspended}} in agony at the gratings, was made to reveal from whom he had procured his spirits. The man was called, and {{turned out to be an}} old superannuated marine, one Scriggs, who did the cooking for the marine-sergeants and masters-at-arms' mess. This marine was {{one of the}} most villainous-looking fellows in the ship, with a squinting, pick-lock, gray eye, and hang-dog gallows gait. How such a most unmartial vagabond had insinuated himself into the honourable marine corps was a perfect mystery. He had always been noted for his <b>personal</b> <b>uncleanliness,</b> and among all hands, fore and aft, had the reputation of being a notorious old miser, who denied himself the few comforts, and many of the common necessaries of a man-of-war life.|$|E
60|$|My {{acquaintance}} with him {{began in a}} moment of weakness. I have an unfortunate predilection to cultivate originality in people, even when accompanied by objectionable character. But, as I lack the firmness and skilfulness which usually accompany this taste in others, and enable them to drop acquaintances when troublesome, I have surrounded myself with divers unprofitable friends, among whom I count the vulgar little boy. The manner in which he first attracted my attention was purely accidental. He was playing in the street, and the driver of a passing vehicle cut at him, sportively, with his whip. The vulgar little boy rose to his feet and hurled after his tormentor a single sentence of invective. I refrain from repeating it, for I feel that I could not do justice to it here. If I remember rightly, it conveyed, in a very few words, a reflection on the legitimacy of the driver's birth; it hinted a suspicion of his father's integrity, and impugned the fair fame of his mother; it suggested incompetency in his present position, <b>personal</b> <b>uncleanliness,</b> and evinced a sceptical doubt of his future salvation. As his youthful lips closed over the last syllable, the eyes of the vulgar little boy met mine. Something in my look emboldened him to wink. I did not repel the action nor the complicity it implied. From that moment I fell into the power of the vulgar little boy, and he has never left me since.|$|E
