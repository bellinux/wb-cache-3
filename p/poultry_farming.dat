5|$|Before development, Hamersley was {{a remote}} {{district}} covered in jarrah, marri, banksia and other vegetation {{typical of the}} Swan Coastal Plain, with small areas cleared for small-scale agriculture such as market gardening and <b>poultry</b> <b>farming.</b> By 1974, six {{years after the first}} subdivision, Hamersley was home to the district's first community hall, an annual parade and fair which were broadcast on Perth TV and radio, an active progress association, and its own newspaper, the Hamersley Gazette, a forerunner to today's Stirling Times. Rapid growth further north removed the focus from Hamersley, which was completed in 1981 and has remained relatively stable since then.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{examines}} economics of vertical integration in poultry industry in Ogun and Oyo States. The {{study examines}} the production systems and analyses costs {{and returns to}} non-integrated and vertically integrated <b>poultry</b> <b>farms.</b> Primary data were generated using structured questionnaires in a field survey of 100 non-integrated <b>poultry</b> <b>farms,</b> 70 partially integrated <b>poultry</b> <b>farms</b> and 40 fully integrated <b>poultry</b> <b>farms.</b> The analytical techniques employed include descriptive statistics and budgetary analysis. The gross margin analysis reveals that the fully integrated poultry production systems have the highest gross margin while the non-integrated <b>poultry</b> <b>farms</b> have the lowest gross margin per 1000 birds. The gross margin per 1000 bird realized by non-integrated <b>poultry</b> <b>farms,</b> partially integrated <b>poultry</b> <b>farms</b> and fully integrated <b>poultry</b> <b>farms</b> are N 758, 828. 07, N 909, 973. 06 and N 985, 645. 12, respectively. Likewise, the net farm income per 1000 birds for fully integrated <b>poultry</b> <b>farm</b> is {{higher than that of}} partially integrated <b>poultry</b> <b>farm</b> which is in turn higher than that of non-integrated <b>poultry</b> <b>farms.</b> The profitability indicators: value added-sales ratio, rate of return on investment and rate of return on fixed cost, increase with the extent of vertical integration, which confirms that vertical integration, is profitable in the poultry industry...|$|R

40|$|Vaccination {{of highly}} {{pathogenic}} avian influenza (HPAI) {{is one of}} the control measures in <b>poultry</b> <b>farm.</b> There are several factors determining farmer’s decision on the implementation of this vaccination. They are the type of poultry, the experience of farmers in the <b>poultry</b> <b>farm,</b> the pattern of <b>poultry</b> <b>farm</b> management, the role of <b>poultry</b> <b>farm</b> on household income, the scale of <b>poultry</b> <b>farm,</b> the mortality rate of poultry, the cost of medication, and the case of HPAI. The analysis result showed that two factors namely type of poultry and the role of <b>poultry</b> <b>farm</b> on household income had significant influence on farmer’s decision to implement HPAI vaccination. In fact, the implementation of HPAI vaccination would be more effective in independent farms since the risk of this disease was single-handedly borne by farmers. Apart from that, the implementation of HPAI vaccination would also be more effective in farms that had never been infected by HPAI, particularly layer farms. Overall, HPAI vaccination would be more effectively implemented through supporting biosecurity measures in <b>poultry</b> <b>farms...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Air {{pollution}} {{has been}} shown to increase the susceptibility to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Previously, we observed an increased incidence of CAP in adults living within 1 km from <b>poultry</b> <b>farms,</b> potentially related to particulate matter and endotoxin emissions. We aim to confirm the increased risk of CAP near <b>poultry</b> <b>farms</b> by refined spatial analyses, and we hypothesize that the oropharyngeal microbiota composition in CAP patients may be associated with residential proximity to <b>poultry</b> <b>farms.</b> Methods: A spatial kernel model was used to analyze the association between proximity to <b>poultry</b> <b>farms</b> and CAP diagnosis, obtained from electronic medical records of 92, 548 GP patients. The oropharyngeal microbiota composition was determined in 126 hospitalized CAP patients using 16 S-rRNA-based sequencing, and analyzed in relation to residential proximity to <b>poultry</b> <b>farms.</b> Results: Kernel analysis confirmed a significantly increased risk of CAP when living near <b>poultry</b> <b>farms,</b> suggesting an excess risk up to 1. 15 km, followed by a sharp decline. Overall, the oropharyngeal microbiota composition differed borderline significantly between patients living < 1 km and ≥ 1 km from <b>poultry</b> <b>farms</b> (PERMANOVA p = 0. 075). Results suggested a higher abundance of Streptococcus pneumoniae (mean relative abundance 34. 9 % vs. 22. 5 %, p = 0. 058) in patients living near <b>poultry</b> <b>farms,</b> which was verified by unsupervised clustering analysis, showing overrepresentation of a S. pneumoniae cluster near <b>poultry</b> <b>farms</b> (p = 0. 049). Conclusion: Living near <b>poultry</b> <b>farms</b> is associated with an 11 % increased risk of CAP, possibly resulting from changes in the upper respiratory tract microbiota composition in susceptible individuals. The abundance of S. pneumoniae near farms needs to be replicated in larger, independent studies. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
