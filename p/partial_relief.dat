500|$|Osborne {{describes}} the scenes that follow—Cavaradossi's interrogation, his torture, Scarpia's sadistic tormenting of Tosca—as Puccini's musical equivalent of grand guignol to which Cavaradossi's brief [...] "Vittoria! Vittoria!" [...] {{on the news}} of Napoleon's victory gives only <b>partial</b> <b>relief.</b> Scarpia's aria [...] "Già, mi dicon venal" [...] ("Yes, they say I am venal") is closely followed by Tosca's [...] "Vissi d'arte". A lyrical andante based on Tosca's act 1 motif, {{this is perhaps the}} opera's best-known aria, yet was regarded by Puccini as a mistake; he considered eliminating it since it held up the action. Fisher calls it [...] "a Job-like prayer questioning God for punishing a woman who has lived unselfishly and righteously". In the act's finale, Newman likens the orchestral turmoil which follows Tosca's stabbing of Scarpia to the sudden outburst after the slow movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. After Tosca's contemptuous [...] "E avanti a lui tremava tutta Roma!" [...] ("All Rome trembled before him"), sung on a middle C monotone [...] (sometimes spoken), the music gradually fades, ending what Newman calls [...] "the most impressively macabre scene in all opera." [...] The final notes in the act are those of the Scarpia motif, softly, in a minor key.|$|E

40|$|Summary 〉 3 D {{structure}} of proteins deeply relates to their functionality. It is well-known that functions of proteins strongly {{appear in the}} bumpy parts of the molecular surfaces, and therefore geometric analysis of protein molecular surfaces is important. We propose a technique to extract geometric features of protein molecular surfaces, and a visual interface to effectively visualize the extracted results. Assuming that molecule surfaces are approximated as triangular meshes, the technique extracts groups of triangles forming <b>partial</b> <b>reliefs,</b> calculates their feature values, and finally clusters them according to the feature values. In addition, our technique extracts larger similarly shaped parts consisting {{of two or more}} reliefs, by simplifying the triangular meshes and applying the graph route problem. The technique provides a visual interface for visualizing the above results applying a hierarchical data visualization technique ”HeiankyoView”...|$|R

60|$|It {{was much}} the same when he essayed to rise. His legs almost refused to support him; {{everything}} appeared to swim before his eyes, and he sank down again listlessly on the ground. For the first time, perhaps, in his life, the strong man had the conviction effectually carried home {{to him that he}} was mortal, and could become helpless. The advantage of early training by a godly mother became apparent in this hour of weakness, for his first impulse was to pray for help, and the resulting effect--whether men choose to call it natural or supernatural--was at least <b>partial</b> <b>relief</b> from anxiety, and that degree of comfort which almost invariably arises from a state of resignation.|$|E
60|$|The {{whole of}} this {{extraordinary}} letter is {{inserted in the}} Appendix, No. 51,--and Mr. Rouse's minute of observations upon it in Appendix, No. 52, fully refuting the few pretexts alleged in that extraordinary performance {{in support of the}} trade by influence and authority. Mr. Hollond, one of the Council, joined Mr. Rouse in opinion that a letter to the purport of that minute should be written; but they were overruled by Messrs. Purling, Hogarth, and Shakespeare, who passed a resolution to defer sending any reply to Mr. Hurst: and none was ever sent. Thus they gave countenance to the doctrine contained in that letter, {{as well as to the}} mischievous practices which must inevitably arise from the exercise of such power. Some temporary and <b>partial</b> <b>relief</b> was given by the vigorous exertions of Mr. Rouse; but he shortly after removing from that government, all complaints were dropped.|$|E
60|$|In {{the cabins}} the berths {{were not made}} up, and those who {{remained}} below had to sit on their hard edges, or on the sofas, which were cumbered with, hand-bags and rolls of shawls. At an early hour after breakfast the bedroom stewards began to get the steamer trunks out and pile them in the corridors; the servants all became more caressingly attentive; and people who had left off settling {{the amount of the}} fees they were going to give, anxiously conferred together. The question whether you ought ever to give the head steward anything pressed crucially at the early lunch, and Kenby brought only a <b>partial</b> <b>relief</b> by saying that he always regarded the head steward as an officer of the ship. March made the experiment of offering him six marks, and the head steward took them quite as if he were not an officer of the ship. He also collected a handsome fee for the music, which is the tax levied on all German ships beyond the tolls exacted on the steamers of other nations.|$|E

60|$|We {{have reason}} to be discontented with many things, and, looking back either through the history of England to much earlier generations or to the {{legislation}} and administrations of later times, we are justified in saying that many of the evils under which our country now suffers are the consequences of folly, ignorance, neglect, or self-seeking in those who, at different times have wielded the powers of rank, office, and money. But the more bitterly we feel this, the more loudly we utter it, the stronger is the obligation we lay on ourselves to beware, lest we also, by a too hasty wresting of measures which seem to promise an immediate <b>partial</b> <b>relief,</b> make a worse time of it for our own generation, and leave a bad inheritance to our children. The deepest curse of wrong-doing, whether of the foolish or wicked sort, is that its effects are difficult to be undone. I suppose there is hardly anything more to be shuddered at than that part of the history of disease which shows how, when a man injures his constitution by a life of vicious excess, his children and grandchildren inherit diseased bodies and minds, and how the effects of that unhappy inheritance continue to spread beyond our calculation. This is only one example of the law by which human lives are linked together; another example of what we complain of when we point to our pauperism, to the brutal ignorance of multitudes among our fellow countrymen, to the weight of taxation laid on us by blamable wars, to the wasteful channels made for the public money, to the expense and trouble of getting justice, and call these the effects of bad rule. This is the law that we all bear the yoke of, the law of no man’s making, and which no man can undo. Everybody now sees an example of it in the case of Ireland. We who are living now are sufferers by the wrong-doing of those who lived before us; we are the sufferers by each other’s wrong-doing; and the children who come after us are and will be sufferers from the same causes. Will any man say he doesn’t care for that law—it is nothing to him—what he wants is to better himself? With what face then will he complain of any injury? If he says that in politics or in any sort of social action he will not care to know what are likely to be the consequences to others besides himself, he is defending the very worst doings that have brought about his discontent. He might as well say that there is no better rule needful for men than that each should tug and drive for what will please him, without caring how that tugging will act on the fine widespread network of society in which he is fast meshed. If any man taught that as a doctrine, we should know him for a fool. But there are men who act upon it; every scoundrel, for example, whether he is a rich religious scoundrel who lies and cheats on a large scale, and will perhaps come and ask you to send him to Parliament, or a poor pocket-picking scoundrel, who will steal your loose pence while you are listening round the platform. None of us are so ignorant as not to know that a society, a nation is held together by just the opposite doctrine and action—by the dependence of men on each other and the sense they have of a common interest in preventing injury. And we working men are, I think, of all classes the last that can afford to forget this; for if we did we should be much like sailors cutting away the timbers of our own ship to warm our grog with. For what else is the meaning of our trades-unions? What else is the meaning of every flag we carry, every procession we make, every crowd we collect for the sake of making some protest on behalf of our body as receivers of wages, if not this: that it is our interest to stand by each other, and that this being the common interest, no one of us will try to make a good bargain for himself without considering what will be good for his fellows? And every member of a union believes that the wider he can spread his union, the stronger and surer will be the effect of it. So I think I shall be borne out in saying that a working man who can put two and two together, or take three from four and see what will be the remainder, can understand that a society, to be well off, must be made up chiefly of men who consider the general good as well as their own.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{retrospectively}} {{examined the}} results of hypofractionated radiotherapy from 24 patients having brain metastases with unknown primary. METHODS: Radiotherapy was administered to 24 patients (20 males (83. 4 %), 4 females (16. 6 %), age range 24 - 75 years) as 10 Gy fraction doses with 10 days intervals {{for a total of}} 30 Gy tumour dose in 3 fractions. Antiedema treatment was given to all patients. Karnofsky performance status was 70 for one patient and below 70 {{for the rest of the}} patients. Multiple metastases were present in 79. 2 % of the patients, in 20. 8 % of the patients there was single lesion and histophatologic diagnosis was present only for this group. 50 % of the patients had hemiplegia, 45. 8 % had hemiparesia, 4. 2 % had quadriplegia and 6 patients (25 %) had other additional pathologies. Treatment was started at the day of admission for 13 patients. RESULTS: The total and <b>partial</b> <b>reliefs</b> in neurological symptoms were seen in 8. 3 % and 37. 5 % of patients, respectively. Median survival from diagnosis of brain lesions was 2. 87 months. The six months, 1 and 2 years survival rates were 33. 3 %, 8. 33 %, and 8. 33 %, respectively. The prognosis of patients with brain metastases is poor and have similar survival rates from the other poor performance patients (KPS< 70).
