40|$|The SWAS {{instrument}} {{consists of}} the moving telescope assembly, the interface baseplate assembly, and the thermal control housing. The movin g telescope structure holds the primary mirror, secondary mirror, and receiver front end in precise alignment. This structure also carries the receiver cold plate radiators, which view cold space both directl y and through reflection off the primary mirror. The moving telescope assembly attaches to the interface baseplate with an open <b>pivot</b> <b>frame</b> through which flex leads from the receiver front end also pass. Two flexure-mounted linear actuators tilt the moving telescope assembly u p to +/- 3 deg in two axes. The interface plate serves as a mounting for these actuators {{as well as the}} acousto-optic spectrometer, the inst rument control electronics, the star tracker, and the balance of the receiver components. The thermal control housing attaches to the inte rface baseplate around its edge. The top cylindrical part of this hou sing serves to shade the receiver cold plate radiators from Sun and Earth influence. The bottom "D" shaped portion of the housing is therma lly isolated from the top and forms the electronlcs radiator. Heat is conducted from the Interface baseplate into this lower portion of the shell. The radiator geometry and conduction paths create a very stab le thermal environment {{in the center of the}} interface baseplate where the AOS and receiver IF amplifiers are heat sinked. The outer surface of the thermal control housing is covered with fused silica second s urface mirrors that reflect visible light and radiate infrared energy. The instrument is mounted to the spacecraft through four thermally- isolating titanium flexures an the underside of the interface basepla te...|$|E
40|$|Pulley {{mechanism}} {{measures the}} tensile loads on a cable under static and dynamic conditions, without disturbing {{the continuity of}} operation of the system. A set of takeoff pulleys are mounted on a <b>pivoted</b> <b>frame</b> that is linked to a strain gage which measures the frame displacement {{as a function of}} the static or dynamic tensile load on the cable...|$|R
25|$|A torque is not {{necessarily}} limited to rotation around a fixed axis, however. It may change the magnitude and/or direction of the angular momentum vector, depending on the angle between the velocity vector and the non-radial component of the force vector, as viewed in the <b>pivot's</b> <b>frame</b> of reference. A net torque on a spinning body therefore {{may result in a}} precession without necessarily causing a change in spin rate.|$|R
50|$|The {{windmill}} {{was produced}} by the Steel Wings Company, in North Sydney between 1907 and 1911 with only six models ever erected. The windmills comprise a steel frame and fan which turns to the wind between a bearing {{at the bottom and}} a swivel at the top, all supported by guy-wires. The fully restored windmills, the only two known working examples in the world, are unique because their fan is contained and spins within the fully <b>pivoting</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|R
50|$|Taroom has a rare {{windmill}} of {{an unusual}} design located {{on the banks of}} the Dawson River. The windmill was produced by the Steel Wings Company, in North Sydney between 1907 and 1911, one of only six models ever erected. The windmills comprise a steel frame and fan which turns to the wind between a bearing at the bottom and a swivel at the top, all supported by guy-wires. Along with another example in Jerilderie in the Riverina, the fully restored windmills are the only two known working examples in the world designed so their fan is contained and spins within the fully <b>pivoting</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|R
40|$|The Motion Base Shuttle Mission Simulator (MBSMS) Strain System is an {{innovative}} engineering tool {{used to monitor}} the stresses applied to the MBSMS motion platform tilt <b>pivot</b> <b>frames</b> during motion simulations in real time. The Strain System comprises hardware and software produced by several different companies. The system utilizes a series of strain gages, accelerometers, orientation sensor, rotational meter, scanners, computer, and software packages working in unison. By monitoring and recording the inputs applied to the simulator, data can be analyzed if weld cracks or other problems are found during routine simulator inspections. This will help engineers diagnose problems as well as aid in repair solutions for both current as well as potential problems...|$|R
50|$|The Heywood {{radiating}} axle locomotives {{could pass}} very tight curves {{by a special}} axle arrangement. This was first drawn by Arthur Heywood in 1877 and described in a book published in 1881, much earlier than the patent filings of the Klien-Lindner axle and Luttermöller axle. On steam locomotives with three axles {{the frame of the}} middle axis could move transversely to the left and right underneath the main frame of the locomotive. The frame was hinged to the two <b>pivoted</b> <b>frames</b> of the front and rear axle. In sharp curves of the track it aligned all axles exactly perpendicular to the track, so that the achses would meet in the centre point of the track's curve.|$|R
50|$|Doors are {{generally}} four panelled timber with pairs of doors with a highlight over to doors {{opening to the}} verandah. The windows are <b>pivoted</b> timber <b>framed</b> sashes, some of which {{appear to have been}} converted from double hung. The interior of the Mitchell Street wing has been relined but the other wing retains much of its original V-jointed lining boards.|$|R
5000|$|A {{more modern}} {{hydraulic}} shock absorber and spring assembly later replaced the old twin springs and friction damper. The rear seat {{was supported by a}} sub-frame down to the rear <b>frame</b> <b>pivot</b> point, providing a semi-sprung seat with 6 in of suspension. (Yamaha would rediscover this suspension system nearly 40 years later.) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{tank was}} based on a {{lengthened}} and modified version of the suspension of the Holt Model 75, with <b>pivoting</b> track <b>frames.</b> There were ten road wheels at each side. The tank was 7 ft tall, 16 ft long, and 9 ft wide. The vehicle had a Holt , 4-cylinder engine fitted with a General Electric generator driving an electric motor for each track; a comparable petro-electric system had earlier been used for the French Saint-Chamond that also was fitted with a lengthened Holt suspension. To prevent overheating the transmission—a constant problem with electrical types—a complicated water cooling system had been installed.|$|R
50|$|The AJS Model 20 and {{corresponding}} Matchless G9 were launched {{at the post}} war Earls Court motorcycle show in late 1948. Initially for export to the US, {{it was not until}} the late summer of 1949 that the first examples reached the home market. The styling was modern and the dual seat, megaphone silencers and bright chrome finish justified the name of Spring Twin. The rest of the cycle parts were standard AMC, with the engine being housed in a <b>pivoted</b> fork <b>frame</b> with telescopic front forks. The basic design changed little over the course of the next few years, the most significant change being made in 1952 when a new Burman gearbox was adopted.|$|R
50|$|The Strowger switch uses two telegraph-type keys on a {{telephone}} set for dialing. Each key requires a separate wire to the exchange. The keys are tapped to step the switch in two stages. The {{first set of}} incoming pulses raises the {{armature of an electromagnet}} to move a shaft which selects the desired level of contacts, by engaging a pawl with the upper ratchet. Another pawl, <b>pivoting</b> on the <b>frame,</b> holds the shaft at that height as it rotates. The second set of pulses, from the second key, operates another electromagnet. Its pawl engages the (hidden) vertical teeth in the lower ratchet to rotate the shaft to the required position. It is kept there against spring tension by a pawl <b>pivoted</b> on the <b>frame.</b> When the switch returns to its home position, typically when a call is complete, a release magnet disengages the pawls that hold the shaft in position. An interlock ensures that the spring on the shaft rotates it to angular home position before it drops to its home position by gravity.|$|R
40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} are described for assessing {{function of the}} cranio-cervical muscles. The method includes assessment of torque produced during flexion/extension, axial rotation, lateral rotation or combination thereof. The apparatus (110) has a lever arm (130) mounted to a support frame (120), wherein {{the length of the}} arm and its angle of extension may be varied. Torque is assessed at an anatomical axis of rotation in a subject. The apparatus axis of rotation may be adjustable. A preferred embodiment has a <b>pivoted</b> support <b>frame</b> for positioning over a subject 2 ̆ 7 s head, wherein the support frame (120) may form a lever arm for rotation. The apparatus may be removably mountable to an upright such as a door jamb...|$|R

Initially for export to the US, {{it was not until}} the late summer of 1949 that the first examples reached the home market. The styling was modern and the dual seat, megaphone silencers and bright chrome finish justified the name of Super Clubman for the matchless and Spring Twin for the AJS. The rest of the cycle parts were standard AMC, with the engine being housed in a <b>pivoted</b> fork <b>frame</b> with telescopic front forks.

50|$|The press style used is {{in direct}} {{correlation}} {{to the end}} product. Press types are straightside, BG (back geared), geared, gap, OBI (open back inclinable) and OBS (open back stationary). Hydraulic and mechanical presses are classified by the frame the moving elements are mounted on. The most common are the gap-frame, also known as C-frame, and the straightside press. A straightside press has vertical columns {{on either side of}} the machine and eliminates angular deflection. A C-frame allows easy access to the die area on three sides and require less floor space. A type of gap-frame, the OBI <b>pivots</b> the <b>frame</b> for easier scrap or part discharge. The OBS timed air blasts, devices or conveyor for scrap or part discharge.|$|R
50|$|In October 1949 BSA also {{launched}} the Bert Hopwood designed 650 cc twin cylinder BSA A10. Although resembling the A7 500 cc twin, {{it had a}} revised engine design and a new A7 soon followed, based on the A10 - in response to competition from the Triumph Tiger 100. Launched as the BSA Star Twin SS the new model had twin carburettors and increased compression ratio. It also had the latest design of cylinder head with austenitic steel inlet and exhaust valves. The uprated engine was fitted to a plunger frame and finished extra chrome. Both models were produced with an option of rigid or plunger frames until 1954 {{and the introduction of}} a <b>pivoted</b> fork <b>frame.</b> The new frame also led to a separate gearbox to replace the bolted on version.|$|R
50|$|The {{rationale}} behind the design was that, if the tender frame could {{be carried on}} more points, represented by the rigidly mounted and Bissel wheels, instead of on only two bogie <b>pivot</b> centres, the <b>frame</b> could be made lighter. The vacuum cylinders which actuated brake blocks on the rigidly mounted wheels were mounted {{on top of the}} tank behind the coal bunker since the wheel arrangement left insufficient room to mount them under the frame as usual.|$|R
50|$|This {{system is}} used on steam {{locomotives}} with fixed outer frames and coupled axles. Typically the conventionally driven wheels are in the centre and there are outer Klien-Lindner axles, front and rear. In this way the wheels, which are fixed to the hollow axles, are 'steered' by shafts that <b>pivot</b> on the <b>frame</b> when the locomotive is curve running. Coupling rods from the conventional driving wheels in the centre act on drive cranks on the inner axles fixed to the frame.|$|R
50|$|The Type FT tender was {{an unusual}} type which used six pairs of wheels in a 2-8-2 wheel arrangement, with the leading and {{trailing}} wheels in Bissel-type pony trucks {{and the rest of}} the axles mounted with a rigid wheelbase. Like the leading and trailing wheels of the engine, all tender wheels were fitted with roller bearings. The rationale behind the design was that if the tender frame could be carried on more points represented by the rigid and Bissel wheels instead of on only two bogie <b>pivot</b> centres, the <b>frame</b> could be made lighter.|$|R
50|$|An {{electromagnet}} advances (steps) the wipers to {{the next}} position when fed with a pulse of DC. The magnet's armature (spring-loaded) operates a pawl that advances a ratchet. When the pawl reaches its full stroke, it blocks the ratchet so it and the wipers will not overshoot. When power to the coil disconnects, the spring retracts the pawl. Another pawl <b>pivoted</b> on the <b>frame</b> ensures that the wipers do not move backward; contact friction keeps them in place. Some uniselector designs step on application of the operate pulse; others step on its removal.|$|R
40|$|An {{efficient}} algorithm for speaker-independent {{spoken word recognition}} is presented. This algorithm {{is based on the}} time-frequency warping with inter-frame consistency, where each frame of an input pattern is mapped to a reference pattern by controlling the mapping of several points (<b>pivots)</b> on the <b>frame.</b> The mapping of non-pivot points is given by linear interpolation between mapping of two consecutive pivots. The optimal mapping is obtained by using a dynamic programming based algorithm. The computational complexity of the algorithm is reduced to less than that of the previous time-frequency warping algorithm with inter-frame consistency. Experimental results show advantageous characteristics of the present algorithm...|$|R
50|$|The tender had a coal {{capacity}} of 10 lt t, a water {{capacity of}} 5587 imp gal {{and a maximum}} axle load of 12 lt 10 lcwt kg. It had an unusual wheel structure of six pairs of wheels in a 2-8-2 wheel arrangement, with the leading and trailing wheels in Bissel-type pony trucks {{and the rest of}} the axles mounted with a rigid wheelbase. Like the leading and trailing wheels of its engine, all tender wheels were fitted with roller bearings.

5000|$|The {{high power}} {{meant that the}} gearbox and clutch did not cope well. and it was {{developed}} into the ‘Series B’ which had internal oil pipes and the gearbox integrated with the engine casting (Unit Construction). The angle between the cylinders was increased to 50° instead of the 47.5° of the Series A engine, which allowed {{the use of the}} engine as part of the frame. The Rapide had ‘’Girdraulic’’ front forks and triangulated rear springing to prevent front end twist under hard braking. and the cantilever rear became the most widely used form of rear suspension for motorcycles after 1980. Brakes were dual 7 in single-leading shoe (SLS), front and rear. A more modern hydraulic shock absorber and spring assembly later replaced the old twin springs and friction damper. The rear seat was supported by a sub-frame down to the rear <b>frame</b> <b>pivot</b> point, providing a semi-sprung seat with 6 in of suspension.|$|R
40|$|Substantial {{vulnerability}} of single-leaf vaults has repeatedly {{been observed in}} the aftermath of past earthquakes. Major vault damage or even collapse may follow the onset of mechanisms such as the indirect bending of the vault crown caused by the unconstrained rocking of the abutments, the shear failure of the vault lunettes induced by possible differential rocking of the supporting masonries, and the direct differential bending induced by the inertia forces acting as a uniformly distributed horizontal load along the vault crown. Unlike other mechanisms, which can be inhibited by traditional global retrofit interventions aimed at triggering a box-like seismic response of the existing building, limiting direct bending requires targeted measures on the vault crown. In this paper, extrados lightweight plywood restraining structures applying passive confinement actions are conceived to delay the onset of the vault direct bending failure mechanism. The reinforcement is designed as a 3 -hinged arch, hinged-constrained at the springing and at the vault key section to enable small relative displacements of the vault springing, which may follow the deformation of any internal ties or roof box structure. The technique is a lightweight and dry solution that does not require specialised labour; it is reversible and minimally impairs the structure's integrity, thus respecting major restoration principles. The effectiveness of the solution is verified through an experimental study on the behaviour of a strengthened single-leaf vault, also in the case of possible relative displacements of the abutments. A special <b>pivoting</b> testing <b>frame</b> is conceived to apply cyclic, uniformly distributed inertia-like forces. The strengthened vault is shown to substantially outperform the response of an unreinforced single leaf vault, tested in a previous research study...|$|R

5000|$|Following these trials, the British Army {{adopted the}} Czechoslovak ZB vz.26 {{light machine gun}} {{manufactured}} in Brno in 1935, although a slightly modified model, the ZB vz. 27, rather than the ZB vz. 26 which had been submitted for the trials. The design was modified to British requirements under new designation ZGB 33, which was then licensed for British manufacture under the Bren name. The major changes were in the magazine and barrel and the lower pistol grip assembly which went from a swiveling grip <b>frame</b> <b>pivoted</b> {{on the front of}} the trigger guard to a sliding grip frame which included the forward tripod mount and sliding ejection port cover. The magazine was curved in order to feed the rimmed [...]303 British cartridge, a change from the various rimless Mauser-design cartridges such as the 8mm Mauser round previously used by Czech designs. These modifications were categorised in various numbered designations, ZB vz. 27, ZB vz. 30, ZB vz. 32, and finally the ZGB 33, which was licensed for manufacture under the Bren name.|$|R
40|$|AbstractPublic Private Partnership (PPP) is {{collaboration}} {{between the public and}} private sector that enables fulfilment of certain common goals by overcoming the visible limitations. Based on studies and sample surveys conducted, the Government has the <b>pivot</b> role of <b>framing</b> health policies and programmes specific to the requirement of each country. However, over the years the health sector has witnessed a demand supply mismatch attributed to a couple of factors. The private sector has served as a catalyst to deliver these services to the people by ways of greater efficiency, better management skills and focused strategies and stronger resource base whether in terms of monetary resources or human resources. This paper aims to give an overview of the evolution of the Public Private Partnership. At the Global Level, it discusses the examples of popular Public Private Partnerships especially in Asian and African states and evaluates its success. Coming down to the National Level, it gives a summary of the existing PPP models in India and further takes up a detailed study of the Chiranjeevi Yojana Scheme in Gujarat. The positives and negatives of the scheme are highlighted. Finally the challenges of PPP in the health sector are assessed putting forth some meaningful suggestions...|$|R
