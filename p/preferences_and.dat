Because family life stresses in-group benefits, <b>preferences,</b> <b>and</b> successes over {{those of the}} individual, collectivist societies tend to use more family symbols in advertising than individualist societies. For example, Korea, which is reputably collectivistic, has more success with family advertisements than the United States, which is reputably individualistic.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{attempt to}} address some {{unresolved}} issues within the Kaplans’ preference-matrix model of environmental preference. These issues involve the relation between legibility <b>and</b> <b>preference</b> <b>and</b> the relations among <b>preference,</b> danger, <b>and</b> mystery. Participants rated 70 within-forest settings containing no visible pathways for preference, danger, or one of seven predictor variables. Legibility and coherence {{were found to be}} independent, positive predictors of <b>preference.</b> Likewise, landmarks <b>and</b> visual access were independent positive predictors of legibility. Legibility fully mediated the positive relation between landmarks <b>and</b> <b>preference.</b> Visual access interacted with legibility in predicting preference: The relation between <b>preference</b> <b>and</b> either predictor was strongest and positive at low values of the other predictor. <b>Preference</b> <b>and</b> danger were negatively correlated, and there was some tendency for each of them to have a different pattern of relations with predictors. Mystery was negatively correlated with both <b>preference</b> <b>and</b> visual access, an unusual finding...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAlthough {{much of the}} {{research}} on human mate preference assumes that mate <b>preference</b> <b>and</b> partner choice will be related to some extent, evidence for correlations between mate <b>preference</b> <b>and</b> mate choice is mixed. Inspired by biological market theories of mate choice, which propose that individuals with greater market value will be better placed to translate their preference into choice, we investigated whether participants' own attractiveness modulated the relationship between their <b>preference</b> <b>and</b> choice. Multilevel modeling showed that experimentally assessed preferences for healthy-looking other-sex faces predicted third-party ratings of partner's facial health better among women whose faces were rated as more attractive by third parties. This pattern of results was not seen for men. These results suggest that the relationship between mate <b>preference</b> <b>and</b> mate choice may be more complex than was assumed in previous research, at least among women. Our results also highlight the utility of biological market theories for understanding the links between mate <b>preference</b> <b>and</b> partner choice...|$|R

5|$|During {{the early}} stages of World War I, as Romania {{remained}} a neutral country, Caragiale's notes record that his friend Bogdan-Pitești was acting as a political agent of the Central Powers, and that money he made available had been provided by German propaganda funds. Nevertheless, the two figures were especially close to one another during and after 1915, and, in 1916, even visited Berlin together. At the time, Caragiale also visited the Germanophile literary circle set up by Mărgărita Miller Verghy, and borrowed a reported 10,000 lei from Bogdan-Pitești, which he never returned. Caragiale's own Germanophile <b>preferences</b> <b>and</b> traditionalist conservatism had by then extinguished his cultural Francophilia, and rumors spread that he himself was a spy for the German Empire.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between the <b>preference</b> <b>and</b> non-preference for certain judo players and their fundamental physical fitness. Twenty excellent judoists in open weight category who were national team members from 1985 to 1988 were selected as the subjects. And than, Bradley and Terry model, which was constructed as one dimensional scaling of game performance, was applied to the game tournamenets of all Japan levels from 1985 to 1988. From the investigation in the validity of the indices obtained, there was a significant <b>preference</b> <b>and</b> non-preference relationship for certain judo players. A new index which could express the <b>preference</b> <b>and</b> non-preference relationship operationally was devised as follows : S_ =(X_ + 0. 5) /(X_ + 0. 5) ^* P_j/P_i where S stands for <b>preference</b> <b>and</b> non-preference index, X for a number of wins and P for the parameter of the Bradley and Terry model. On the basis of the results, a correlation ration between the <b>preference</b> <b>and</b> non-preference index and fundamental physical fitness was calculated. As a result, body weight, skin fold fat (abdomen), chest girth, hip girth, arm strength, bench press, squat, high clean, arm pullover,side step, step test and endurance run were significantly correlated with the <b>preference</b> <b>and</b> non-preference index...|$|R

5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} {{reticulate}} whipray as Vulnerable. Its large size, inshore habitat <b>preferences,</b> <b>and</b> slow reproductive rate render it susceptible to overfishing. Although specific data is lacking, significant declines in overall ray catches {{have been documented}} within its range, including in the Gulf of Thailand, the Arafura Sea, and off Pakistan. Habitat degradation also threatens this species: over 30% of the mangroves in Indonesia and Malaysia have been cleared since 1980, while pollution and destructive fishing practices may have also taken their toll. Australian waters offer the reticulate whipray a refuge from fishing pressure, as there it is not targeted commercially and the installation of Turtle Exclusion Devices (TEDs) have reduced bycatch mortality. However, there are indications of increasing illegal fishing in Australian territory by Indonesian vessels.|$|E

Some {{companies}} in the telecommunications industry have indeed found it difficult to adjust to the new customer behavior patterns, especially in the matters of customer <b>preference</b> <b>and</b> requirement. Such that a noticeable gap has opened up between the service provider and their customer’s expectations. This research focus on the resulting expectations and perceptions of Service Quality customer in the Celular Telecommunication Industry. It also aims to (1) examine the overall environmental factors that influence customer <b>preference</b> <b>and</b> requirement of pre-paid or post-paid cellular telecommunication services in the industry (2) analyze the effect of the service marketing mix of the cellular telecommunication industry to customer <b>preference</b> <b>and</b> requirement (3) find out customer evaluation on SERVQUAL of cellular telecommunication industry (4) analyze the effect of cellular telecommunication service marketing mix on customer satisfaction and loyalty. The customer loyalty is analyzed as an industry, under the assumption that the customer have known their provider well enough and the research tools used are the same. Therefore a loyalty index for the Cellular Industry can be achieved. The results of this research indicated that the market environment influence the nature of <b>preference</b> <b>and</b> requirement in the pre and postpaid telecommunication services. Meanwhile, the service marketing mix by the telecommunications service providers influence the nature of customer <b>preference</b> <b>and</b> requirement in the case of pre-paid services {{and in the case of}} post-purchase, there is only physical evidence variable that doesn’t show evidence of influence over customer <b>preference</b> <b>and</b> requirement. This reveals a movement in customer <b>preference</b> <b>and</b> furthermore, the cellular telecommunication service marketing mix positively influence levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty achieved will depend on the price, location, process, and personnel offered by the company. Therefore they must always pay attention to the rapid changes in customer priority, <b>preference</b> <b>and</b> requirement in order for them to achieve a high level of customer loyalty. service quality, customer loyalty...|$|R
