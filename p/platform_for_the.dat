5|$|In {{addition}} to the planned role as a tender for torpedo boats, she was also intended {{to serve as a}} test <b>platform</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> new self-propelled torpedo. Up to the mid-1870s, the German navy had only experimented with a handful of torpedo ships, all of which were equipped with the old spar torpedo. The ship's design provided the basis for both later German avisosthe and all subsequent light cruisers, but also to numerous foreign designs, such as several classes of French, Italian, and Austrian avisos and torpedo craft.|$|E

5|$|The Sunderland Echo is {{an evening}} {{newspaper}} serving the Sunderland, South Tyneside and East Durham areas of North East England.

Designed to provide a <b>platform</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Radical views held by Storey and his partners, it was also Sunderland's first local daily paper.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge is}} both a {{connector}} and a viewing <b>platform</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> park. It was designed to link the Historic Michigan Boulevard District and the entire Loop to the west with the Lake Michigan lakefront to the east.

5|$|The {{fuselage}} contained {{two major}} bulkheads, with the cockpit {{at the front}} of the first bulkhead. The nose was fitted with a rotating machine gun mount, offset to allow the pilot a better field of forward vision. The cockpit was fully glazed, with the exception of the lower right section, which acted as a <b>platform</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> bombardier-gunner. The commonly-used Lotfernrohr-series bombsight penetrated through the cockpit floor into a protective housing on the external side of the cockpit.|$|E

5|$|Tomb Raider III {{is built}} on an {{upgraded}} version of the Tomb Raider engine used by its predecessors. The engine offers better speed efficiency and new graphical features such as coloured lighting and triangular polygons, allowing developers to achieve greater detail and more complex geometry. The game {{was designed to be}} more in line with the puzzle-solving gameplay of the original Tomb Raider as opposed to the more shooting-oriented style of Tomb Raider II. The PlayStation served as the lead <b>platform</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> game, while the Microsoft Windows release is simply a better-looking conversion.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{were now}} 02 down {{and needed to}} win three Tests in a row to retain the Ashes. The {{pressure}} on McCabe increased when last-minute injuries meant {{that he had to}} open the bowling. McCabe made 63 and 22 and took a wicket as Australia won their first match in the series. He then top-scored with 88 in Australia's first innings of 288 and made 55 in the second as Australia won by 148 runs in the Fourth Test in Adelaide to level the series. In the deciding Test at the MCG, McCabe scored 112, one of three centuries as Australia amassed 604, a record score in Ashes Tests in Australia. This laid the <b>platform</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> innings victory that retained the Ashes. McCabe aggregated 491 runs in five Tests at 54.55, with a century and five fifties in a consistent display.|$|E

He could meet civilian needs in nondestructive testing and also military ones. A possible continuation of the project could be {{the use of the}} robot on aircraft larger than the Airbus A320. The CEO also revealed that Akka Technologies plans to work on a duo of robots for inspection: the same mobile <b>platform</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> lower parts, and a drone for the upper parts.

5|$|In the Middle Ages, the Strand {{became the}} {{principal}} route between the separate settlements of the City of London (the civil and commercial centre) and the royal Palace of Westminster (the national political centre). In the archaeological record, {{there is considerable}} evidence of occupation {{to the north of}} Aldwych, but much along the former foreshore has been covered by rubble from the demolition of the Tudor Somerset Place, a former royal residence, to create a large <b>platform</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> building of the first Somerset House, in the 17th century. The landmark Eleanor's Cross was built in the 13th century at the western end of the Strand at Charing Cross by Edward I commemorating his wife Eleanor of Castile. It was demolished in 1647 by the request of Parliament during the First English Civil War, but reconstructed in 1865.|$|E
5|$|Iron Duke {{remained}} {{on active duty}} {{for only a few}} more years; in 1930, the London Naval Treaty specified that the four Iron Duke-class battleships be scrapped or otherwise demilitarised. Iron Duke was therefore converted into a gunnery training ship; her armour and much of her armament was removed to render her unfit for combat. She served in this capacity until the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, when she was moored in Scapa Flow as a harbour defence ship. In October, she was badly damaged by German bombers and was run aground to avoid sinking. She continued to serve as an anti-aircraft <b>platform</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> duration of the war, and was eventually refloated and broken up for scrap in the late 1940s.|$|E
