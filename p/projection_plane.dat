40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the issue of}} automation of orthoimage generation based on Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) data and digital images. The following two problems are discussed: automatic generation of <b>projection</b> <b>planes</b> based on TLS data, and automatic orientation of digital images in relation to TLS data. The majority of popular software applications use manual definitions of <b>projection</b> <b>planes.</b> However, the authors propose an original software tool to address the first issue, which defines important planes based on a TLS point cloud utilizing different algorithms (RANdom SAmple Consensus–RANSAC, Hough transform, “region growing”). To address the second task, the authors present a series of algorithms for automated digital image orientation {{in relation to a}} point cloud. This is important in cases where scans and images are acquired from different places and at different times. The algorithms utilize Scale Invariant Feature Transform(SIFT) operators in order to find points that correspond in reflectance intensity between coloure images (Red Green Blue—RGB) and orthoimages, based on TLS data. The paper also presents a verification method using SIFT and Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) operators. The research results in an original tool and applied Computer Vision(CV) algorithms that improve the process of orthoimage generation...|$|R

40|$|International audienceVisualisation of {{very complex}} environments can be {{significantly}} accelerated using occlusion culling. In this paper {{we present a}} visibility preprocessing method which efficiently computes potentially visible geometry for volumetric viewing cells. We introduce novel extended projection operators, which permits efficient occlusion culling with respect to all viewpoints within a cell, and {{takes into account the}} combined occlusion effect of multiple occluders. We use extended projection of occluders onto a set of <b>projection</b> <b>planes</b> to create extended occlusion maps; we show how to efficiently test occludees against these occlusion maps to determine occlusion with respect to the entire cell. We also present an improved projection operator for certain specific but important configurations. An important advantage of our approach is that we can re-project extended projections onto a series of <b>projection</b> <b>planes</b> (via an occlusion sweep), and thus accumulate occlusion information from multiple blockers. This new approach allows the creation of effective occlusion maps for previously hard-to-treat scenes such as leaves of trees in a forest. Graphics hardware is used to accelerate both the extended projection and reprojection operations. We present a complete implementation of our preprocessing algorithm demonstrating significant speedup with respect to view-frustum culling only, without the computational overhead of on-line occlusion culling...|$|R
