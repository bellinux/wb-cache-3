Predation by raptors and corvids is a concern, particularly where utility poles may provide hunting perches near leks (i. e., breeding areas). Perch deterrents may offer a mitigating strategy if deterrents reduce the frequency or duration of perching. To investigate {{the effects of}} various perch deterrents, we deployed deterrents on 5 power poles retained for use in this study when 33 poles were removed from occupied grouse habitat. We rotated deterrents among poles every 15 to 28 days (x = 19. 4 days) from November 17, 2011, through November 20, 2012, so that all deterrents occurred multiple times on all poles. We compared perch frequency and duration on 4 <b>pole</b> <b>caps,</b> 3 insulator deterrents, an untreated control cross arm, and 5 cross-arm-length deterrents: Pupi™ cross arms mounted at a 22 ° angle from horizontal; Birdzoff™ deterrents; an experimental shroud; Power Line Sentry X™ deterrents; and Zena Designs™ minispike deterrents. We collected 862 independent records of perching events. Raptors and corvids perched most often (χ 2 = 146. 0, P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) on untreated cross arms ( = 0. 60 perches/day), and insulator deterrents (x = 0. 47 perches/day), and perched least often on <b>pole</b> <b>caps</b> with spikes (x = 0. 11 perches/day) and Zena Designs mini-spikes (x = 0. 10 perches/day).

For most of the observation, UZ For was only barely detected in X-rays and ∼ 800 times fainter than during a high state previously observed with ROSAT. A transient event, which lasted ∼ 900 s, was detected simultaneously by the X-ray instruments and, in the UV, by the Optical Monitor. The transient was likely caused by the impact of 10 17 – 10 18 g of gas on the main accretion region of the white dwarf. The X-ray spectrum of the transient is consistent with ∼ 7 keV thermal bremsstrahlung from the shock-heated gas in the accretion column. A soft blackbody component due to reprocessing of X-rays in the white dwarf atmosphere is not seen. The increase in the UV flux during the transient was likely caused by cyclotron radiation from the shockheated gas. Two more flaring events were detected by the Optical Monitor while the X-ray instruments were not operating. We conclude from our analysis that the unusual flaring behavior during the low state of UZ For was caused by intermittent increases of the mass transfer rate due to stellar activity on the secondary. In addition to the transient events, the Optical Monitor detected a roughly constant UV flux consistent with 11000 –K blackbody radiation from the photosphere of the white dwarf. We find a small orbital modulation of the UV flux caused by a large, heated <b>pole</b> <b>cap</b> around the main accretion region...|$|E

The disappearance of patches of ice - for instance, the bright rays surrounding some impact craters - from the equatorial regions of Ganymede and Callisto may approach a value (the irreversible evaporation rate) three orders of magnitude larger than the net equatorial loss rate for ice-covered Europa.

40|$|During {{mitotic spindle}} assembly, the sister chromatids {{have to be}} {{captured}} by kinetochore (K) -fibers (bundles of kinetochore microtubules; KMTs) to ensure stable attachment of the chromosomes. This {{is a prerequisite for}} chromosome congression at the metaphase plate, and the subsequent segregation of separated sister chromatids to the spindle poles. Although, this is a critical step during mitosis, the identity and regulation of the proteins that mediate the formation and stabilization of K-fibers are still largely unknown. This thesis describes a functional characterization of HURP (hepatoma upregulated protein) and CHICA (C 20 Orf 129), two proteins recently identified in a proteomic survey of the human spindle apparatus (Sauer et al., 2005). The spindle association of both proteins was analyzed with polyclonal antibodies, showing that that of HURP and CHICA were mutually exclusive. While HURP decorated the KMT plus ends, CHICA localized to the spindle <b>pole</b> <b>caps</b> and had no major influence on K-fiber stability. The description of the CHICA project will be brief, as this work was primarily continued by Dr. Anna Santamaria. Her investigations demonstrated that CHICA is important for the spindle recruitment of the chromokinesin Kid, which is required for polar ejection forces. 	Our studies showed that HURP binds to, and bundles microtubules (MTs) in vitro. In vivo, HURP localizes predominantly to K-fibers in the vicinity of chromosomes and is required for K-fiber stabilization. Moreover, we revealed that importin β binds to the N-terminus of HURP and demonstrated that the nucleotide state of the small GTPase Ran controls HURP localization and function. We conclude that the spindle assembly pathway centered on RanGTP contributes to K-fiber stabilization and that HURP is a critical target of this pathway. To better understand the mechanism of HURP recruitment to the K-fibers we subsequently carried out a structure-function analysis of the different HURP domains. This study revealed that the N-terminus, which contains two coiled coil domains binds to, and bundles MTs and is essential for the initial loading of HURP onto the spindle, whereas the C-terminus (including a Guanylate kinase-associated protein domain; GKAP) is involved in the specific KMT plus end targeting. Furthermore, we identified a conserved mitosis-specific Cdk 1 phosphorylation site in the GKAP domain of HURP, indicating that in addition to the RanGTP gradient, Cdk 1 phosphorylation may also play a role in HURP recruitment to the K-fibers...|$|R

Our results also suggest that the gamma-ray emission from millisecond pulsars is more isotropic and less strongly beamed than the emission at X-ray wavelengths. Furthermore, the observed distribution of apparent gamma-ray efficiencies provides support for the slot gap or the outer gap models over those in which the gamma-ray emission originates from regions close to the neutron star's magnetic <b>poles</b> (polar <b>cap</b> models).

40|$|Photograph of a White Deer Skin Dance Ceremony of the Hoopa Indians, ca. 1900. Two {{adult men}} stand {{to the center}} right of the photo wearing {{what appear to be}} crowns, as well as {{multiple}} necklace-like ornaments. Each man is wearing a wrap around his waist that appears to be made of animal hide, and carries an object in his right hand down by his thigh, as well as a roll of what appears to be more animal hide in his left. These men are flanked by five other visible Native Americans, two of whom are children wearing what appear to be furry headdresses. These other participants are standing {{to the right of the}} two adorned men, holding <b>poles</b> <b>capped</b> by the head of deer that lead down the pole's length with skinned deer hide that is still attached to the heads. They stand in what appears to be a clearing within a forest. The men have painted their faces below the eyes. However, the children remain unpainted.; "The dance was a special ceremony of the Hoopa Indians. To obtain the skin of a white deer is to secure a mascot that will protect the owner for life. These skins are very scarce and were probably handed down for several generations. They must not be sold or traded. In the intervals between dances, the priest or old man relates to the people the stories of former days and the laws they should observer with care. The ceremony ends with a dance in which all the braves participate. The white deerskin dance is one of the peculiar survivals of the superstitious of the California Indian. To kill a deer is not such an exceptional occurrence, but to obtain the skin of a white deer is to obtain secure a mascot which will protect the owner and his friends from every trouble. Frequently, these skins are handed down as heirlooms from generation to generation, and it is asserted that a white deerskin in a canoe will save the occupants no matter how tremendous the storm that overtakes them. " [...] picture file card (part 1 of 2).; "The illustration here shows a party of Indians indulging in the white deerskin dance. Men only ate allowed to participate; the women are much too inferior and useless for an occasion of this kind. Head skins and bands of the most hideous kinds are worn and in a variety of other ways luck is invlked [sic, i. e., involved] and the white deerskin worshipped. This dance was held every year in August or September. The ceremony consumed several days with dances at various sacred places along the river and at Bald Hill. The costumes for the dance were specially prepared. The dancers in line behind have deerskins partly stuffed and mounted on poles. Several are shown to be albino deer. These are very scarce and the skins were probably handed down for several generations. They must not be sold or traded. In the intervals between the dances the priest ot [sic, i. e., or] old man related to the ople [sic, i. e., people] the stories of former days and the laws they should observe with care. The ceremony ends with a dance in which all the braves participate. " [...] picture file card (part 2 of 2).; Note: Not Maricopa Indians, but Yurok.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{cleavage}} during the syncytial blastoderm {{stage of the}} Drosophila embryo was studied in fixed whole-mounts using a triple- staining technique. Plasmalemma was stained with Concanavalin A conjugated to tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate, the underlying cortical F-actin with a fluorescein derivative of phalloidin, and nuclei with 4 ',- 6 diamidine- 2 -phenylindole dihydrochloride. The surface caps, which overlie the superficial nuclei at this stage, {{were found to be}} rich in F-actin as compared {{with the rest of the}} cortex. After the caps formed, they extended over the surface and flattened. Whilst this was occurring the F-actin network within the caps became more diffuse. By the end of the expansion process F-actin had become concentrated at both <b>poles</b> of the <b>caps.</b> The caps then split in two. The cleavage was not accompanied by the formation of any apparent contractile ring of microfilaments across the cap, rather the break region was depleted in F-actin. The cortical actin associated with each half of the old cap then became reorganized around a nucleus to form a new daughter cap, and the cycle began again...|$|R
