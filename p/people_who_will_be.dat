Although lead vocalist Mark Hall, who either wrote or co-wrote all the songs on the album, felt [...] "a little worried" [...] about the band's follow-up album, fellow recording artists Steven Curtis Chapman (who co-produced the band's first album) and Mac Powell of Christian rock band Third Day encouraged Hall to [...] "say what God wants you to say".

60|$|Think of that!--thou--and thou--and thou!--for in thee, at this moment, {{is either}} heaven or hell: and which of them? Ask thyself-- ask thyself, friend. If thou art not in heaven in this life, thou wilt never be in heaven {{in the life}} to come. At death, says the wise man, each thing returns into its own element, into the ground of its life; the light into the light, and the {{darkness}} into the darkness. As the tree falls so it lies. My friends, who call yourselves enlightened Christian folk, do you suppose that you can lead a mean, worldly, covetous, spiteful life here, and then the moment your soul leaves the body that you are to be changed into the very opposite character, into angels and saints, as fairy tales tell of beasts changed into men? If a beast can be changed into a man, then death can change the sinner into a saint,--but not else. If a beast would enjoy being a man, then a sinner would enjoy being in heaven, but not else. A sinful, worldly man enjoy being in heaven? Does a fish enjoy being on dry land? The sinner would long {{to be back in}} this world again. Why, what is the employment of spirits in heaven, according to the Bible (for that is the point to which I have been trying to lead you round again)? What but glorifying God? Not TRYING only to do every thing to God's glory, but actually succeeding in DOING it--basking in the sunshine of His smile, delighting to feel themselves as nothing before His glorious majesty, meditating on the beauty of His love, filling themselves with the sight of His power, searching out the treasures of His wisdom, and finding God in all and all in God--their whole eternity one act of worship, one hymn of praise. Are there not some among us who will have had but little practice at that work? Those who have done nothing for God's glory here, how do they expect {{to be able to do}} every thing for God's glory hereafter? (Those who will not take the trouble of merely standing up at the psalms, like the rest of their neighbours, even if they cannot sing with their voices God's praises in this church, how will they like singing God's praises through eternity?) No; be sure that the only <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> fit for heaven, who will like heaven even, are those who have been in heaven in this life,--the only <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> able to do every thing to God's glory in the new heavens and new earth, are those who have been trying honestly to do all to His glory in this heaven and this earth.|$|E

30|$|Risk is {{determined}} by the interaction of exposure, vulnerability, and hazard (IPCC 2014). The common definition of exposure is the area and number of hazard-affected bodies (IPCC 2012). Exposure is the situation of people, infrastructure, housing, production capacities, and other tangible human assets located in hazard-prone areas (UNGA 2016) or the intersection of potential hazard-affected bodies and a hazard in an area (Shi et al. 2014). These definitions may lead to an overestimation of population exposure, by taking into account <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> never <b>be</b> affected by a certain intensity hazard despite living in hazard-prone areas. For example, buildings designed with a seismic fortification against intensity VII earthquakes are resistant to seismic activities with intensities less than VII (Zhang and Jin 2008). In this study, we considered population exposure as the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> actually <b>will</b> <b>be</b> affected in hazard-prone areas instead of the entire population of these areas. To calculate this, we collected historical records of the population affected by natural hazards and derived the population affected rate for each hazard to obtain the actual exposure of the population.|$|R
60|$|No {{doubt there}} are many <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> deeply {{interested}} to know that Rossetti was once chased round his garden by an infuriated zebu {{he was trying to}} exhibit to Mr. Whistler, or that he had a great affection for a dog called 'Dizzy,' or that 'sloshy' was one of his favourite words of contempt, or that Mr. Gosse thought him very like Chaucer in appearance, or that he had 'an absolute disqualification' for whist-playing, or that he was very fond of quoting the Bab Ballads, or that he once said that if he could live by writing poetry he would see painting d---d! For our part, however, we cannot help expressing our regret that such a shallow and superficial biography as this should ever have been published. It is but a sorry task to rip the twisted ravel from the worn garment of life and to turn the grout in a drained cup. Better, after all, that we knew a painter only through his vision and a poet through his song, than that the image of a great man should be marred and made mean for us by the clumsy geniality of good intentions. A true artist, and such Rossetti undoubtedly was, reveals himself so perfectly in his work, that unless a biographer has something more valuable to give us than idle anecdotes and unmeaning tales, his labour is misspent and his industry misdirected.|$|E
60|$|If birth {{were all}} {{the making of a}} civilized man, the men of the future, on the general {{principles}} we have imputed to them, would under no circumstances find the birth of a child, healthy in body and brain, more than the most venial of offences. But birth gives only the beginning, the raw material, of a civilized man. The perfect civilized man is not only a sound strong body but a very elaborate fabric of mind. He is a fabric of moral suggestions that become mental habits, a magazine of more or less systematized ideas, a scheme of knowledge and training and an æsthetic culture. He is the child not only of parents but of a home and of an education. He has to be carefully guarded from physical and moral contagions. A reasonable probability of ensuring home and education and protection without any parasitic dependence on people outside the kin of the child, will be a necessary condition to a moral birth under such general principles as we have supposed. Now, this sweeps out of reason any such promiscuity of healthy people as the late Mr. Grant Allen is supposed to have advocated--but, so far as I can understand him, did not. But whether it works out to the taking over of the permanent monogamic marriage of the old morality, as a going concern, is another matter. Upon this matter I must confess my views of the trend of things in the future {{do not seem to be}} finally shaped. The question involves very obscure physiological and psychological considerations. A man who aims to become a novelist naturally pries into these matters whenever he can, but the vital facts are very often hard to come by. It is probable that a great number of people could be paired off in couples who would make permanently happy and successful monogamic homes for their sound and healthy children. At any rate, if a certain freedom of regrouping were possible within a time limit, this might be so. But I am convinced that a large proportion of married couples in the world to-day are not completely and happily matched, that there is much mutual limitation, mutual annulment and mutual exasperation. Home with an atmosphere of contention is worse than none for the child, and it is the interest of the child, and that alone, that will be the test of all these things. I do not think that the arrangement in couples is universally applicable, or that celibacy (tempered by sterile vice) should be its only alternative. Nor can I see why the union of two childless people should have an indissoluble permanence or prohibit an ampler grouping. The question is greatly complicated by the economic disadvantage of women, which makes wifehood the chief feminine profession, while only for an incidental sort of man is marriage a source of income, and further by the fact that most women have a period of maximum attractiveness after which it would be grossly unfair to cast them aside. From the point of view we are discussing, the efficient mother who can make the best of her children, is the most important sort of person in the state. She is a primary necessity to the coming civilization. Can the wife in any sort of polygamic arrangement, or a woman of no assured status, attain to the maternal possibilities of the ideal monogamic wife? One is disposed to answer, No. But then, on the other hand, does the ordinary monogamic wife do that? We are dealing with the finer people of the future, strongly individualized <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> much freer from stereotyped moral suggestions and much less inclined to be dealt with wholesale than the people of to-day.|$|E
