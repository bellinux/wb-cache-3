5|$|<b>Pancreatic</b> cancer rarely occurs {{before the}} age of 40, {{and more than half of}} cases of <b>pancreatic</b> {{adenocarcinoma}} occur in those over 70. Risk factors for <b>pancreatic</b> cancer include tobacco smoking, obesity, diabetes, and certain rare genetic conditions. About 25% of cases are linked to smoking, and 5–10% are linked to inherited genes. <b>Pancreatic</b> cancer is usually diagnosed by a combination of medical imaging techniques such as ultrasound or computed tomography, blood tests, and examination of tissue samples (biopsy). The disease is divided into stages, from early (stageI) to late (stageIV). Screening the general population has not been found to be effective.|$|E
5|$|At least 50% {{of people}} with <b>pancreatic</b> {{adenocarcinoma}} have diabetes {{at the time of}} diagnosis. While long-standing diabetes is a known risk factor for <b>pancreatic</b> cancer (see Risk factors), the cancer can itself cause diabetes, in which case recent onset of diabetes could be considered an early sign of the disease. People over 50 who develop diabetes have eight times the usual risk of developing <b>pancreatic</b> adenocarcinoma within three years, after which the relative risk declines.|$|E
5|$|Cystadenocarcinomas {{account for}} 1% of <b>pancreatic</b> cancers, {{and they have}} a better {{prognosis}} than the other exocrine types.|$|E
5|$|For locally {{advanced}} and metastatic <b>pancreatic</b> adenocarcinomas, which together represent over 80% of cases, numerous recent trials comparing chemotherapy regimes have shown increased survival times, {{but not to}} more than one year. Overall five-year survival for <b>pancreatic</b> cancer in the US has improved from 2% in cases diagnosed in 1975–77, and 4% in 1987–89 diagnoses, to 6% in 2003–09. In the less than 20% of cases of <b>pancreatic</b> adenocarcinoma with a diagnosis of a localized and small cancerous growth (less than 2cm in Stage T1), about 20% of Americans survive to five years.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, <b>pancreatic</b> cancers of {{all types}} {{resulted}} in 411,600 deaths globally. <b>Pancreatic</b> cancer is the fifth {{most common cause of}} death from cancer in the United Kingdom, and the fourth most common in the United States. The disease occurs most often in the developed world, where about 70% of the new cases in 2012 originated. <b>Pancreatic</b> adenocarcinoma typically has a very poor prognosis: after diagnosis, 25% of people survive one year and 5% live for five years. For cancers diagnosed early, the five-year survival rate rises to about 20%. Neuroendocrine cancers have better outcomes; at five years from diagnosis, 65% of those diagnosed are living, though survival varies considerably {{depending on the type of}} tumor.|$|E
5|$|On 26 June 2003, Thatcher's husband Sir Denis died of <b>pancreatic</b> cancer, and was cremated on 3 July.|$|E
5|$|Pausch died of {{complications}} from <b>pancreatic</b> cancer on July 25, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{of the most common}} form of <b>pancreatic</b> cancer may include yellow skin, abdominal or back pain, unexplained weight loss, light-colored stools, dark urine and loss of appetite. There are usually no symptoms in the disease's early stages, {{and symptoms}} that are specific enough to suggest <b>pancreatic</b> cancer typically do not develop until the disease has reached an advanced stage. By the time of diagnosis, <b>pancreatic</b> cancer has often spread to other parts of the body.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{developing}} <b>pancreatic</b> cancer is lower among non-smokers, and people who maintain a healthy weight and limit their consumption of red or processed meat. A smoker's chance {{of developing}} the disease decreases if they stop smoking, and almost returns {{to that of the}} rest of the population after 20years. <b>Pancreatic</b> cancer can be treated with surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, palliative care, or a combination of these. Treatment options are partly based on the cancer stage. Surgery is the only treatment that can cure <b>pancreatic</b> adenocarcinoma, and may also be done to improve quality of life without the potential for cure. Pain management and medications to improve digestion are sometimes needed. Early palliative care is recommended even for those receiving treatment that aims for a cure.|$|E
5|$|The {{spread of}} <b>pancreatic</b> cancer to other organs (metastasis) may also cause symptoms. Typically, <b>pancreatic</b> {{adenocarcinoma}} first spreads to nearby lymph nodes, {{and later to}} the liver or to the peritoneal cavity, large intestine or lungs. It is uncommon for it to spread to the bones or brain.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from not}} smoking, the American Cancer Society {{recommends}} keeping a healthy weight, and increasing consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while decreasing consumption {{of red and}} processed meat, {{although there is no}} consistent evidence this will prevent or reduce <b>pancreatic</b> cancer specifically. A 2014 review of research concluded that there was evidence that consumption of citrus fruits and curcumin reduced risk of <b>pancreatic</b> cancer, while there was possibly a beneficial effect from whole grains, folate, selenium, and non-fried fish.|$|E
5|$|Chronic {{pancreatitis}} {{appears to}} almost triple risk, and as with diabetes, new-onset pancreatitis {{may be a}} symptom of a tumor. The risk of <b>pancreatic</b> cancer in individuals with familial pancreatitis is particularly high.|$|E
5|$|Liver {{function}} {{tests can}} show {{a combination of}} results indicative of bile duct obstruction (raised conjugated bilirubin, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and alkaline phosphatase levels). CA19-9 (carbohydrate antigen 19.9) is a tumor marker that is frequently elevated in <b>pancreatic</b> cancer. However, it lacks sensitivity and specificity, not least because 5% of people lack the Lewis (a) antigen and cannot produce CA19-9. It has a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 73% in detecting <b>pancreatic</b> adenocarcinoma, and is used for following known cases rather than diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|On July 1, 1985 the Rev. Dr. Pauli Murray died of <b>pancreatic</b> {{cancer in}} the house she owned with a lifelong friend, Maida Springer Kemp, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{administration}} of enzymes {{can be used}} to treat some functional enzyme deficiencies, such as <b>pancreatic</b> insufficiency and lactose intolerance.|$|E
5|$|The <b>pancreatic</b> islets {{make up the}} {{endocrine}} part of the pancreas, and synthesize and secrete hormones including insulin {{into the}} bloodstream. There {{is evidence that the}} beta cells in the islets that synthesize insulin contain dopamine receptors, and that dopamine acts {{to reduce the amount of}} insulin they release. The source of their dopamine input is not clearly established—it may come from dopamine that circulates in the bloodstream and derives from the sympathetic nervous system, or it may be synthesized locally by other types of <b>pancreatic</b> cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of a permanent biliary stent (e.g. in <b>pancreatic</b> cancer) slightly {{increases the risk of}} cholangitis, but stents of this type are often needed to keep the bile duct patent under outside pressure.|$|E
25|$|Differential {{rotation}} and fusion of the ventral and dorsal <b>pancreatic</b> buds {{results in the}} formation of the definitive pancreas. As the duodenum rotates to the right, it carries with it the ventral <b>pancreatic</b> bud and common bile duct. Upon reaching its final destination, the ventral <b>pancreatic</b> bud fuses with the much larger dorsal <b>pancreatic</b> bud. At this point of fusion, the main ducts of the ventral and dorsal <b>pancreatic</b> buds fuse, forming the main <b>pancreatic</b> duct. The duct of the dorsal bud regresses, leaving the main <b>pancreatic</b> duct.|$|E
25|$|As part of {{embryonic}} development, the pancreas forms from the embryonic foregut {{and is therefore}} of endodermal origin. <b>Pancreatic</b> development begins {{with the formation of}} a ventral and a dorsal <b>pancreatic</b> bud. Each structure communicates with the foregut through a duct. The dorsal <b>pancreatic</b> bud forms the head, neck, body, and tail, whereas the ventral <b>pancreatic</b> bud forms the uncinate process.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} common {{conditions}} of the exocrine pancreas is acute pancreatitis, which in the majority of cases relates to gallstones that have impacted in the <b>pancreatic</b> part of the biliary tree, or due to acute or chronic alcohol abuse or as a side-effect of ERCP. Other forms of pancreatitis include chronic and hereditary forms. Chronic pancreatitis may predispose to <b>pancreatic</b> cancer and is strongly linked to alcohol use. Other rarer diseases affecting the pancreas may include <b>pancreatic</b> pseudocysts, exocrine <b>pancreatic</b> insufficiency, and <b>pancreatic</b> fistulas.|$|E
25|$|Locoregional {{complications}} include <b>pancreatic</b> pseudocyst (Most common, {{occurring in}} up to 25% of all cases) and phlegmon / abscess formation, splenic artery pseudoaneurysms, hemorrhage from erosions into splenic artery and vein, thrombosis of the splenic vein, superior mesenteric vein and portal veins (in descending order of frequency), duodenal obstruction, common bile duct obstruction, progression to chronic pancreatitis, <b>pancreatic</b> ascites, pleural effusion, <b>pancreatic</b> abscess, sterile/infected <b>pancreatic</b> necrosis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pancreatic</b> cancer: A 2012 {{meta-analysis}} {{found no}} evidence that passive smoking was associated with an increased risk of <b>pancreatic</b> cancer.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pancreatic</b> {{insufficiency}} and malabsorption can {{be managed}} with <b>pancreatic</b> enzyme replacement therapy, such as pancrelipase supplementation and other related methods.|$|E
25|$|The most {{prominent}} effect of JBS is <b>pancreatic</b> exocrine insufficiency. Varying degrees of decreased secretion of lipases, <b>pancreatic</b> juices such as trypsin, trypsinogen and others, {{as well as}} malabsorption of fats and disruptions of glucagon secretion and its response to hypoglycemia caused by insulin activity are major concerns when JBS is diagnosed. Associated with developmental errors, impaired apoptosis, and both prenatal and chronic inflammatory damage, necrosis and fibrosis of the <b>pancreatic</b> acini (clusters of <b>pancreatic</b> exocrine gland tissue, where secretion of <b>pancreatic</b> juice and related enzymes occurs), <b>pancreatic</b> exocrine insufficiency in JBS can additionally stem from congenital replacement of the acini with fatty tissue. Near total replacement of the entire pancreas with fatty tissue has also been reported. This is a progressive, sometimes fatal consequence of the disorder.|$|E
25|$|Jobs was {{diagnosed}} with a <b>pancreatic</b> neuroendocrine tumor in 2003 and died on October 5, 2011, of respiratory arrest related to the <b>pancreatic</b> tumor.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pancreatic</b> {{disease may}} present {{with or without}} {{symptoms}}. When symptoms occur, such as in acute pancreatitis, a person may suffer from acute-onset, severe mid-abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. In severe cases, pancreatitis may lead to rapid blood loss and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. When the pancreas is unable to secrete digestive enzymes, such as with a <b>pancreatic</b> cancer occluding the <b>pancreatic</b> duct, result in jaundice. <b>Pancreatic</b> disease might be investigated using abdominal x-rays, MRCP or ERCP, CT scans, and through blood tests such as measurement of the amylase and lipase enzymes.|$|E
25|$|Less common causes include <b>pancreatic</b> cancer, <b>pancreatic</b> duct stones, {{vasculitis}} (inflammation of {{the small}} {{blood vessels in the}} pancreas), and porphyria—particularly acute intermittent porphyria and erythropoietic protoporphyria.|$|E
25|$|Secretion of {{gastric acid}} or {{alkaline}} <b>pancreatic</b> juice from the ectopic mucosa leads to ulceration {{in the adjacent}} ileal mucosa i.e. peptic or <b>pancreatic</b> ulcer.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} the {{diagnostic}} power of MALDI/TOF is {{in the area of}} cancer. <b>Pancreatic</b> cancer {{remains one of the most}} deadly and difficult to diagnose cancers. Impaired cellular signaling due to mutations in membrane proteins has been long suspected to contribute to <b>pancreatic</b> cancer. MALDI/TOF has been used to identify a membrane protein associated with <b>pancreatic</b> cancer and at one point may even serve as an early detection technique.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have been}} {{performed}} {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of miRNAs as potential markers for cancers. MicroRNAs have shown promise in this area due to their stability and specificity to cells and tumors. A recent study investigated the use of miRNA as a biomarker in <b>pancreatic</b> ductal adenocarcinoma, a form of <b>pancreatic</b> cancer. The study analyzed RNA from biopsied <b>pancreatic</b> cysts to identify deviations in expression of miRNAs. The study found that 228 miRNAs were expressed differently relative to normal <b>pancreatic</b> cells. Included in the findings was an association between hepatocellular carcinoma and the upregulation of miR-92a, a member of OncomiR-1.|$|E
25|$|Ghrelin {{inhibits}} glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from beta {{cells in}} the <b>pancreatic</b> islets. Ghrelin does this indirectly by promoting local negative feedback mediated by somatostatin from <b>pancreatic</b> delta cells, which selectively express the ghrelin receptor.|$|E
25|$|Since the 2010 tournament, {{the players}} have helped raise {{awareness}} and call for more research funding for <b>pancreatic</b> cancer organizations. This intercollegiate rugby initiative has raised over $140,000 for The <b>Pancreatic</b> Cancer Action Network.|$|E
25|$|The acute {{pancreatitis}} (acute hemorrhagic <b>pancreatic</b> necrosis) {{is characterized by}} acute inflammation and necrosis of pancreas parenchyma, focal enzymic necrosis of <b>pancreatic</b> fat and vessel necrosis (hemorrhage). These are produced by intrapancreatic activation of <b>pancreatic</b> enzymes. Lipase activation produces the necrosis of fat tissue in <b>pancreatic</b> interstitium and peripancreatic spaces as well as vessel damage. Necrotic fat cells appear as shadows, contours of cells, lacking the nucleus, pink, finely granular cytoplasm. It is possible to find calcium precipitates (hematoxylinophilic). Digestion of vascular walls results in thrombosis and hemorrhage. Inflammatory infiltrate is rich in neutrophils. Due to the pancreas lacking a capsule, the inflammation and necrosis can extend to include fascial layers {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the pancreas.|$|E
25|$|The {{cells are}} {{sensitive}} to the environment, such as gel stiffness and contact with other cells. Individual cells do not thrive; a minimum of four proximate cells was required for subsequent organoid development. Modifications to the medium composition produced either hollow spheres mainly composed of <b>pancreatic</b> progenitors, or complex organoids that spontaneously undergo <b>pancreatic</b> morphogenesis and differentiation. Maintenance and expansion of <b>pancreatic</b> progenitors require active Notch and FGF signaling, recapitulating in vivo niche signaling interactions.|$|E
25|$|Ghrelin {{promotes}} gastrointestinal and <b>pancreatic</b> malignancy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pancreatic</b> {{cancer is}} the fifth-most-common cause of cancer deaths in the United States, and the seventh most common in Europe. In 2008, {{globally}} there were 280,000 new cases of <b>pancreatic</b> cancer reported and 265,000 deaths. These cancers are classified as endocrine or nonendocrine tumors. The most common is ductal adenocarcinoma. The most significant risk factors for <b>pancreatic</b> cancer are advanced age (over 60) and smoking. Chronic pancreatitis, diabetes or other conditions may also be involved in their development. Early <b>pancreatic</b> cancer does not tend to result in any symptom, but when a tumor is advanced, a patient may experience severe pain in the upper abdomen, possibly radiating to the back. Another symptom might be jaundice, a yellowing of the skin and eyes.|$|E
