40|$|Common ceramic {{component}} manufacturing typically {{involves the}} processing of the raw materials in powder form. Granulated powder is formed into a green body of the desired size and shape by consolidation, often by simply pressing nominally dry powder. Ceramic powders are commonly <b>pressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>steel</b> dies or rubber bags {{with the aim of}} producing a near-net-shape green body for subsequent sintering. Density gradients in these compacts, introduced during the pressing operation, are often severe enough to cause distortions {{in the shape of the}} part during sintering due to nonuniform shrinkage. In such cases, green machining or diamond grinding operations may be needed to obtain the desired final shape and size part. In severe cases, nonuniform shrinkage may even cause fracture in the parts during sintering. Likewise, density gradients can result in green bodies that break during ejection from the die or that are too fragile to be handled during subsequent processing. Empirical relationships currently exist to describe powder compaction but provide little understanding of how to control die design or compaction parameters to minimize density gradients thereby forcing the designer to use expensive and time consuming trial and error procedures. For this reason, interest has grown in developing computational tools to address this problem (Aydin et al., 1996 and Coube, 1998). The goal of the present work was to develop a general continuum-based finite element model for ceramic powder compaction that can be used to aid and guide the design and pressing of ceramic powders. Such a model can be used to improve both part and die/bag pressing design, resulting in more efficient and cost effective ways to make better parts...|$|E

The company managed to land several large orders like an all-steel body for Buick and 2000 Oakland superstructures. Later Budd also made bodies for Cadillac, Chrysler, Delage, Citroën, Mercedes, Morris and Nash as well as the doors of the Ford Model T. In 1916 Budd also started the Budd Wheel Company making wheels for Dodge. In 1935 they made ventilated disc brakes, first for racing, but later also for passenger cars.|$|R

40|$|Press {{hardening}} steel {{has become}} a much used material in car body manufacturing due to its excellent safety and lightweight potential. In some recent car models press hardening steel has reached already a weight share of more than 20 % in the body structure while {{it is estimated that}} it could reach even around 40 % in the future. However conventional press hardening steel based on the alloying concept 22 MnB 5 was designed originally not for automotive application. In spite of the high strength level, press hardening steel has generally low toughness due to the relatively high carbon content and its martensitic microstructure. Particularly important is the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature at low temperature, which might lead to unexpected failure in cold climate regions. Furthermore, hydrogen embrittlement is a major concern <b>in</b> <b>press</b> hardening <b>steel</b> as previous results indicated that only a few ppm of hydrogen could induce delayed cracking. Generally it is important that impact energy should be absorbed by the material to avoid unexpected disintegration of the structure. This material capability is usually characterized by the toughness. All these characteristics have not yet been systematically investigated <b>in</b> <b>press</b> hardening <b>steel.</b> Consequently, no {{attempts have been made to}} optimize conventional press hardening steel for obtaining better toughness, lower ductile-to-brittle transition temperature and reduced sensitivity to hydrogen induced cracking. A generally proven approach of improving the resistance against brittle failure <b>in</b> high strength <b>steel</b> is the refinement of microstructure, which can be efficiently achieved by Nb microalloying. This paper will introduce modified alloy designs for press hardening steel and explain fundamentally the metallurgical effects of Nb microalloying on the improvement of crack propagation resistance, bendability and delayed cracking behavior induced by hydrogen penetration <b>in</b> <b>press</b> hardening <b>steel.</b> The results reveal better toughness, improved bending behavior and increased resistance against hydrogen embrittlement. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Fly ash from Tapada do Outeiro, a {{coal power}} plant {{in the north of}} Portugal, has been {{processed}} by a powder technology route in order to obtain durable and mechanical resistant ceramics. Dolomite (CaCO 3. MgCO 3) was added in different proportions to the waste material, from zero up to 10 wt%, and the effect of this addition on the densification behaviour of the fired samples was investigated by measuring the apparent density, the open porosity and the linear shrinkage. The powder mixtures were uniaxially dry <b>pressed</b> <b>in</b> a <b>steel</b> die and fired at temperatures ranging from 950 to 1150 ºC. XRD and SEM were used to identify the phases present in the sintered materials and the degree of densification. The results revealed that added dolomite was responsible for the appearance of anorthite, an extra phase besides mullite and quartz, for an increase in the amount of liquid phase and for the swelling of closed pores at the highest firing temperatures. Significant morphological changes and phase transformations occurred during sintering and their effects on the physical-mechanical and leaching characteristics of the sintered materials were analyzed...|$|R

The first few Tigers assembled had to be fitted with a Borg-Warner 4-speed all-synchromesh manual gearbox, until Ford resolved its supply problems and was able to provide an equivalent unit as used in the Ford Mustang.|$|R
40|$|Synroc C waste form {{specimens}} prepared {{using the}} Australian-developed technology are uniaxially <b>pressed</b> <b>in</b> stainless <b>steel</b> bellows at 1200 {degrees}C and 20 MPa. This produces a material with high chemical and physical durability {{and with the}} radioactivity enclosed inside both the waste form and the bellows. An alternative method of producing the ceramic product is to use cold pressing of pellets followed by reactive sintering to provide densification and mineralization. Depending {{on the scale of}} waste form preparation required and on the activity level and nature of the waste streams, the cold press and sinter method may have advantages. To evaluate the effects of production method on waste form characteristics, especially resistance to dissolution or leaching of waste elements, we have prepared two simulated waste samples for evaluation. Both samples were prepared from liquid precursor materials (alkoxides, nitrates, and colloidal silica) and then doped with waste elements. The precursor material in each case corresponded to a basic phase assemblage of 60 % zirconolite, 15 % nepheline, 10 % spinel, 10 % perovskite, and 5 % rutile. One sample was doped with 25 % by weight of U; the other with 10 % by weight each of U and Gd. Each sample was calcined at 750 {degrees}C for 1 hr. in a 3. 5 % H{sub 2 } in N{sub 2 } atmosphere.
