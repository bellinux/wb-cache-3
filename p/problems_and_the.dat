40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} the Presburger liveness problems for nondeterministic reversal-bounded multicounter machines {{with a free}} counter (NCMFs). We show the following: – <b>The</b> §-Presburger-i. o. <b>problem</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> §-Presburger-eventual <b>problem</b> are both decidable. So are their duals, <b>the</b> ¨-Presburger-almost-always <b>problem</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ¨-Presburger-always <b>problem.</b> – <b>The</b> ¨-Presburger-i. o. <b>problem</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ¨-Presburger-eventual <b>problem</b> are both undecidable. So are their duals, <b>the</b> §-Presburger-almost-always <b>problem</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> §-Presburger-always <b>problem.</b> These results {{can be used to}} formulate a weak form of Presburger linear temporal logic and develop its model-checking theories for NCMFs. They can also be combined with [12] to study the same set of liveness problems on an extended form of discrete timed automata containing, besides clocks, a number of reversalbounded counters and a free counter. ...|$|R

5|$|Continued work {{displayed}} {{a number of}} minor <b>problems,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{decision was made to}} introduce a redesigned unit with significant improvements in packaging, insulation, and other practical changes. This would become the AI Mk. V, which began to arrive from Pye in late February and immediately demonstrated a host of problems. By this time the microwave units were being designed, and the Mk. V was almost cancelled. A contract for over 1,000 units was allowed to continue in case of delays in the new units. By May the issues with the Pye design were ironed out, and the FIU's testing revealed it to be superior to the Mk. IV, especially in terms of maintenance. An RAE report agreed.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, major {{advances}} {{were made}} in welding technology, including the introduction of automatic welding in 1920, in which electrode wire was fed continuously. Shielding gas became a subject receiving much attention, as scientists attempted to protect welds {{from the effects of}} oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere. Porosity and brittleness were the primary <b>problems,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> solutions that developed included the use of hydrogen, argon, and helium as welding atmospheres. During the following decade, further advances allowed for the welding of reactive metals like aluminum and magnesium. This in conjunction with developments in automatic welding, alternating current, and fluxes fed a major expansion of arc welding during the 1930s and then during World War II. In 1930, the first all-welded merchant vessel, M/S Carolinian, was launched.|$|E

5|$|SR 149 was {{relocated}} onto a new two-lane alignment in the mid-1970s, {{leaving behind}} Openshaw Road. Caltrans began studies for interchanges {{at each end}} in September 1992. The California Transportation Commission approved funding for four-laning SR 149 in April 1994 and the two interchanges in May 1996, with construction to begin in 1998 and cost $47 million. Due to state budget <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> need to study environmental impacts, the project was repeatedly pushed back; these impacts and inflation had more than doubled the cost to $120 million in 2004. In particular, an endangered species of meadowfoam was discovered on the south embankent, forcing a redesign. Construction began in September 2005 on a new freshwater marsh near the State Route 70 intersection to replace beaver ponds {{in the path of}} the highway, and it was completed in March 2006.|$|E
5|$|Sticky & Sweet Tour was {{the eighth}} concert tour by American singer Madonna to promote her {{eleventh}} studio album, Hard Candy.

Though initially planned, the tour did not visit Australia due to financial <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> financial recession. Costume designer Arianne Phillips designed the costumes, supported {{by a number of}} famous designers and brands. The stage for the main show was planned similarly to that of her previous 2006 Confessions Tour.

5|$|The {{build-up}} {{of toxins}} and pollutants in seabirds {{is also a}} concern. Seabirds, being apex predators, suffered from the ravages of DDT until it was banned; among other effects, DDT was implicated in embryo development <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> skewed sex ratio of western gulls in southern California. Oil spills are also a threat to seabird species, as both a toxin and because the feathers of the birds become saturated by the oil, causing them to lose their waterproofing. Oil pollution threatens species with restricted ranges or already depressed populations.|$|E
5|$|The final wartime Silverplates {{incorporated}} all technical {{improvements to}} B-29 aircraft, {{as well as}} the final series of Silverplate modifications that included Curtiss Electric reversible-pitch propellers, and pneumatic actuators for rapid opening and closing of bomb bay doors. The British F-type bomb release and G-type attachment were installed, along with dual electrical and mechanical bomb release mechanisms. Early model B-29s were plagued by a host of engine <b>problems,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> early Silverplate bombers were no exception. One was written off after being badly damaged {{as a result of an}} engine fire in February 1945. The fuel-injected Wright R-3350-41 engines in the later model bombers delivered in July and August 1945 were greatly improved and far more reliable. This was an important factor in the success of the 509th Composite Group's operations.|$|E

5|$|The {{mainstay}} {{treatment of}} epilepsy is anticonvulsant medications, possibly for the person's entire life. The choice of anticonvulsant {{is based on}} seizure type, epilepsy syndrome, other medications used, other health <b>problems,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> person's age and lifestyle. A single medication is recommended initially; {{if this is not}} effective, switching to a single other medication is recommended. Two medications at once is recommended only if a single medication does not work. In about half, the first agent is effective; a second single agent helps in about 13% and a third or two agents at the same time may help an additional 4%. About 30% of people continue to have seizures despite anticonvulsant treatment.|$|E
5|$|With {{the units}} in the rear, the only {{communications}} method was via the intercom. Contemporary systems used the radio as the intercom as well, but the TR9D sets used in RAF aircraft used the voice channel for 15 seconds every minute for the pip-squeak system, blocking communications. Even when modified sets were supplied that addressed this, the radar was found to interfere strongly with the intercom. A speaking tube was tried but found to be useless. Newer VHF radios being developed through this same period did not suffer these <b>problems,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Blenheims were moved {{to the front of}} the queue to receive these units.|$|E
5|$|Apple {{unveiled}} the PowerBook100 on October 21, 1991, at the Comdex computer expo in Las Vegas, {{with two other}} models, the PowerBook 140 and PowerBook 170. The advertisement and the product were both successful. Apple projected US sales of more than 200,000 PowerBooks in the first year, with peak demand {{in the first three}} months of release. By January 1992, Apple had sold more than 100,000 PowerBooks, by which time they were in short supply. Apple soon solved the supply <b>problems,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> proceeds from PowerBook sales reached $1billion in the first year after launch. Apple surpassed Toshiba and Compaq as the market leader in worldwide share of portable computer shipments. The PowerBook100, 140, and 170 contributed greatly to Apple's financial success in 1992. At the end of the financial year, Apple announced its highest figures yet, $7.1billion in revenues and an increase in global market share from 8% to 8.5%, the highest it had been in four years.|$|E

5|$|Despite these {{production}} <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that}} the I-250 had yet even to be submitted for State acceptance trails, an order had been placed for fifty more aircraft on 26 February (these aircraft have {{been referred to as}} the MiG-13, which presumably would have been their designation if they had actually entered service). A new deadline of 5 July 1946 was set for the delivery of the first pre-production aircraft, but it was stymied, again, for a lack of an engine. By this time seven airframes had been completed, but all lacked engines. The first I-250 was finally accepted on 8 August and flown for the first time three days later, although its engine seals failed and a number of ignition cables were scorched. The engine replacement and repairs forced the aircraft to miss its scheduled appearance at the Tushino Air Display. It was handed over to the NII VVS (Air Force Institute) on 15 September to finally begin its State acceptance tests. All ten aircraft had been delivered by 30 October, although construction number 3810107 (Factory No. 381, first batch, seventh aircraft) was used as a static test airframe and 3810110 became a static engine testbed.|$|E
5|$|In between Novel {{sections}} are Escape sections, which {{occur when}} the player finds themselves in a room from which they need to find the means of escape. These are presented from a first-person perspective, with the player being able to move between different pre-determined positions in each room. To escape, the player is tasked with finding various items and solving puzzles, reminiscent of escape-the-room games. At some points, the player may need to combine objects {{with each other to}} create the necessary tool to complete a puzzle. The puzzles include various brain teasers, such as baccarat and magic squares. An in-game calculator is provided for math-related <b>problems,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> player can ask characters for hints if they find an Escape room too difficult. All Escape sections are self-contained, with all items required to solve the puzzles being available within that section; items are not carried over between Escape sections. After finishing an Escape section, it becomes available to replay from the game's main menu.|$|E
5|$|Paja Jovanović (1859–1957) {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} Serbian realist painters of the late 19th century. During his early career, he came to be identified with Orientalist painting, depicting scenes from the Balkans, which were then under the control of the Ottoman Empire. Between 1877 and 1882, he attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, where he came under the mentorship of painting instructors Christian Griepenkerl and Leopold Müller. Griepenkerl taught the young Jovanović the underlying structural principles of Renaissance and Baroque art, thus helping him better understand spatial <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> arrangement of large numbers of figures, both moving and static. Müller encouraged Jovanović to take a naturalist approach to painting, recording only what he could see and relying as little as possible on his imagination. It was in this context that Müller instructed Jovanović to make direct studies of Balkan life during his visits home, purposely steering him towards Orientalist painting.|$|E
