40|$|The {{synthesis}} of phytochelatins (PCs) {{is essential for}} the detoxification of nonessential metals and metalloids such as cadmium and arsenic in plants {{and a variety of other}} organisms. To our knowledge, no direct evidence for a role of PCs in essential metal homeostasis has been reported to <b>date.</b> <b>Prompted</b> by observations in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicating a contribution of PC synthase expression to Zn 2 + sequestration, we investigated a known PC-deficient Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutant, cad 1 - 3, and a newly isolated second strong allele, cad 1 - 6, with respect to zinc (Zn) homeostasis. We found that in a medium with low cation content PC-deficient mutants show pronounced Zn 2 + hypersensitivity. This phenotype is of comparable strength to the well-documented Cd 2 + hypersensitivity of cad 1 mutants. PC deficiency also results in significant reduction in root Zn accumulation. To be able to sensitively measure PC accumulation, we established an assay using capillary liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry of derivatized extracts. Plants grown under control conditions consistently showed PC 2 accumulation. Analysis of plants treated with same-effect concentrations revealed that Zn 2 +-elicited PC 2 accumulation in roots reached about 30 % of the level of Cd 2 +-elicited PC 2 accumulation. We conclude from these data that PC formation is essential for Zn 2 + tolerance and provides driving force for the accumulation of Zn. This function might also help explain the mysterious occurrence of PC synthase genes throughout the plant kingdom and in a wide range of other organisms...|$|R

The terrigenous deposits are constituted by three formations: the Arenas the Utrillas Fm (Cenomanian), the Arenas y arcillas de Castro de FuentidueÃ±a Fm (Turonian), and the Arenas y arcillas de Segovia Fm (Early Coniacian). Six lithofacies associations where detected in the Arenas de Utrillas Fm (Cenomanian), and interpreted as low sinuosity bed-load coarse sand riverâs deposits. The Arenas y arcillas de Castro de FuentidueÃ±a Fm (Turonian) is constituted by 13 lithofacies associations. Their features support coastal depositional setting, as tidal or low energy coastal environments. This formation represented a transgressive-regressive sedimentary cycle and the autochthonous glaucony-rich deposits correspond to maximum flooding. In the Arenas y arcillas de Segovia Fm (Earliest Coniacian), 8 lithofacies associations where recognized. Two asociations, identified in the Soto del Real area, have been interpreted as fluvial deposits (located in a very distant place from the other outcrops), while the other 6 lithofacies associations matched to tidal depositional environment and represented the beginning of another sedimentary cycle, also including the immediately superposed carbonate formation (DolomÃ­as tableadas de Caballar Fm). The acquired <b>dates</b> <b>prompt</b> to a paleoenviromental reconstruction in the study area: 1) a fluvial depositional environments, flowing from NW to SE developed during the Cenomanian; 2) a marine transgressive-regressive cycle, which flooded the all studied area, took place during Early-Middle Turonian; 3) and finally {{the beginning of a new}} transgressive cycle, characterized the Early Conician record. Moreover, a morphologic step in the basement has been identifyed, which could have strongly controlled the sedimentation...|$|R
50|$|Witt, {{along with}} fellow blue chip signings Ben Kennedy and Brent Kite, added much needed player {{strength}} at Manly in 2005 {{and the club}} qualified for its first semi finals series since 1998 and finished in eighth position. For {{the first half of}} the season Manly was among the dominant teams of the NRL, and Witt's form correspondingly at five-eighth was some of the best of his career to <b>date,</b> <b>prompting</b> Manly officials to publicly thank Parramatta for releasing him. Among the highlights were excellent performances in the victories over eventual Premiers Wests Tigers and in the amazing come-from-behind win against the Penrith Panthers. Penrith led 26-6 early in the second half, before a Witt-inspired Manly team powered home to win 36-26 at Brookvale Oval. Also during this period, Witt kicked 20 successive goals without a miss. However, Manly found wins hard to come by in the second half of the season, and Witt experienced the same frustrations that plagued his 2004. In a match in July against the Wests Tigers, he received a one-week suspension for striking Liam Fulton. And after a disappointing 36-10 loss to the St George Illawarra Dragons a few weeks later, Witt was dropped from the first grade squad after being targeted by the big Dragons forwards due to his perceived defensive deficiencies. Manly coach Des Hasler used a number of forwards at five-eighth in subsequent games, but with very little success, and Witt was drafted back into the side for the semi final against Parramatta. Despite Manly being hopelessly outclassed 46-22 to be eliminated, Witt sent the crowd alight by scoring one of the best tries of 2005, as he weaved through the Parramatta defence and sprinted fifty metres to score under the posts. However, this great moment was marred by yet another two-week suspension, this time for a high tackle on Eels hooker Mark Riddell. Witt was among the leading pointscorers in the NRL for 2005, scoring 140 points from five tries and 60 goals from 19 appearances.|$|R
