40|$|International audienceThe {{role of the}} Mg 2 + cation on {{antihypertensive}} molecule {{binding on}} human serum albumin (HSA) was studied by affinity chromatography. The thermodynamic data corresponding to this binding were determined {{for a wide range}} of Mg 2 + concentrations (c). For the nifedipine molecule, an increase in the Mg 2 + concentration produced a decrease in binding due to a decrease in the electrostatic interactions. For verapamil and diltiazem, which have the highest solvent accessible surface area, the solute binding on HSA was divided into two Mg 2 + concentration regions. For a low c value below c(c) (approximately 1. 6 mmol/l), the binding dependence with c was similar to that of nifedipine. For c above c(c) the hydrophobic effect created in the bulk solvent associated with a decrease in the van der Waals interactions between the solute molecule and the HSA implied a decrease in its binding.

40|$|Abstract In {{the repair}} of complex {{congenital}} heart defects or in surgery of the aortic arch, normal circulation may be temporarily halted {{to ensure a}} clean, bloodless operation field. The brain is the organ most vulnerable to ischemic injury during this no-flow period, and the mortality and morbidity of these procedures today consists mostly of neurological complications. Hypothermia decreases the need for oxygen and other metabolites, and cooling the patient with an extracorporeal heart-lung machine can provide enough time to perform the necessary surgical procedures during a circulatory standstill. This procedure {{is referred to as}} hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA). Sometimes the cerebral circulation can be maintained even if {{the rest of the body}} undergoes circulatory arrest, and this strategy, involving separate catheterization of brain-destined vessels, is referred to as selective cerebral perfusion (SCP). In this work, four separate brain protection strategies were evaluated. Two studies were performed on a surviving porcine model (I, II) to evaluate neurological recovery as well as cerebral metabolism and histopathology, and two were acute in design (III, IV), employing the modern technology of intravital microscopy to examine cerebral microcirculation. The first study (I) showed that the administration of hypertonic saline dextran (HSD) led to a decrease in intracranial pressure, improved brain metabolism, better neurological recovery and less histopathological injury of the brain tissue in association with HCA. In the second study (II) a novel <b>pharmacological</b> <b>molecule,</b> levosimendan, reduced the intracranial pressure during the operation, but no improvement in terms of cerebral metabolism, neurological recovery or histopathological brain injury was observed after HCA. In the third study (III), real-time intravital microscopy showed that in association with HCA, a leukocyte depleting filter (LDF) attached to the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit reduces the number of activated leukocytes in cerebral microcirculation. In the fourth study (IV), cerebral metabolism and microcirculation were similar during SCP independent of the acid-base management strategy. The results of this work suggest that HSD could be assessed in human trials, that levosimendan needs further studies to optimize its potential, that the LDF functions as designed and that the differences between the α- and the pH-stat acid-base management strategies with SCP did not differ in moderate hypothermia...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{numerous}} therapeutic achievements, infectious diseases, such as viral infections, {{remain a}} continuous hazard to human health, {{in part due}} to emergence or re-emergence of new and hazardous viruses or the lack of appropriate vaccines or prophylactic or post-exposure therapies. Successful elimination of infectious viruses highly depends on the dynamic interplay between leukocytes and proteins of the fast-responding broad-spectrum innate and more slowly and highly specific adaptive immune system. Extensive research efforts during the last decade demonstrated the processes of virus recognition and innate defense signaling by host cells as essential steps that shape the overall immune response to virus infections. As a result, insight into general molecular and cellular mechanisms of innate immunity together with comprehensive understanding of the particular contribution of a specific leukocyte subset within a given virus infection, are critical to understand viral pathogenesis and immunopathology. Furthermore, exploring the mechanisms by which the innate immune system can be triggered to sustain an effective adaptive immune response may pave the way to new therapy and vaccine strategies. COAM (chlorite-oxidized oxyamylose) is a polyanionic polysaccharide derivative which has been synthesized at the Rega Institute and has been known for many years as an antiviral agent. Its broad-spectrum antiviral potency has been demonstrated in lethal virus infection models, such as influenza virus and herpes simplex virus-induced and mengovirus-induced encephalitis. A thorough comprehension about its mechanism of action remained unexplored, though, it was initially suggested that COAM modulates the immune response by acting as an antiviral interferon (IFN) inducer. In the framework of this doctoral research our principal aim was to elucidate which molecules and cells of the innate immune system were responsible for the antiviral resistance induced by COAM in vivo, and to gain insight into the impact of pharmacological modulation of antiviral immunity on the outcome of infection. Throughout this project, a mouse picornavirus, i. e. mengovirus, which induces fatal meningoencephalitis, was used as a model to study the protective mechanisms of COAM on acute lethal virus infection. In a first part of this doctoral thesis, we investigated direct and indirect antiviral mechanisms of COAM in vitro, and attempted to draw a comparison with the dsRNA mimetic polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid or poly(I:C), which is a well-known antiviral interferon (IFN) inducer. Although COAM and poly(I:C) share a polyanionic nature, their mode of action in vitro relies on different mechanisms. In comparison with a strong IFN induction and mRNA upregulation of the helicases RIG-I and MDA- 5 by poly(I:C), COAM did not enhance IFN-a or -ß and IFN-inducible RNA helicases in mouse fibroblastoid cells. Instead, COAM inhibited virus entry by blocking the attachment to the cells. These results suggest that COAM can alter the outcome of in vitro infection, not by IFNinduction and in turn modifying the cellular antiviral state, but through inhibition of virus entry into cells. However, although these data point to virus attachment to the cell membrane as the target of antiviral action, this viral entry-inhibiting effect was rather weak, suggesting that this effect is unlikely to fully account for the previously observed potent in vivo antiviral protection by COAM. Secondly, possible cellular and molecular mechanisms of innate immunity that might underlie the observed antiviral protection by COAM in vivo were further explored. The COAM mixture was fractionated and prophylactic intraperitoneal treatment of mice with COAM polymers of high molecular weight resulted in a conversion from 100 % lethal viral encephalitis, caused by mengovirus infection, to an overall survival rate of 93 %, without obvious clinical sequelae. COAM induced a profound peritoneal influx of neutrophil granulocytes together with an activation of macrophages, which correlated with decreased viral titers in peritoneum, blood and target organs, and an annihilation of cerebral induction of proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, COAM was able to interact with the chemokine system. Mouse granulocyte chemotactic protein- 2 (GCP- 2) /CXCL 6, a potent neutrophil attracting chemokine, was found to bind COAM. In addition, COAM also induced mouse GCP- 2 in vitro and in vivo. The antiviral effects of COAM decreased significantly in mice depleted of neutrophils and macrophages, which demonstrated that these cells co-determined the antiviral resistance induced by COAM. All together, these results established that COAM rescued mice from acute and lethal mengovirus infection by recruiting antiviral leukocytes to the site of infection, i. e. the peritoneum. These findings reinforce the role of neutrophils and macrophages as key effector cells that can be manipulated toward antiviral defense. In a last part, the concept that COAM modulates the migration of leukocytes in vivo was further explored and extended to interactions with chemokines other than GCP- 2. Chemokines are central players in coordinating directional and selective leukocyte migration into tissues. COAM induced the transcriptional program of various mouse CXC and CC chemokines in vitro and also in peritoneal leukocytes upon injection of mice with COAM. In addition, COAM was able to directly interact with chemokines through binding. In particular, efficient binding was observed for the neutrophil chemokines KC/CXCL 1 and MIP- 2 /CXCL 2, as well as the monocyte chemoattractant RANTES/CCL 5 and IP- 10 /CXCL 10, the latter being chemotactic for monocytes, activated T cells and natural killer cells. Some degree of binding specificity was detected as no binding interactions were observed for MCP- 1 /CCL 2 and MIP- 1 a/CCL 3. Binding affinities of interacting chemokines for COAM were all in the nM-range and were similar to those observed for the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulphate, which represents an endogenous chemokine-binding molecule responsible for sustaining chemotactic gradients across vesselwalls and into the extracellular matrix and tissues. Although COAM did not display chemotactic activity by itself, the chemokine binding feature of COAM was translated to in vivo leukocyte recruitment as COAM binding to mouse GCP- 2 promoted a fast and cooperative neutrophil chemotaxis into the peritoneal cavity of mice. These results showed that the formation of a binding complex between COAM and specific chemokines might represent the underlying mechanism of the observed effect on leukocyte migration in vivo. Binding of COAM to GCP- 2 and other chemokines might provide an endogenous chemotactic force, influencing selective and directional leukocyte chemotaxis. In conclusion, central to the mechanism of antiviral protection of the polysaccharide derivative COAM is the concept of leukocyte chemotaxis. Leukocytes, in particular neutrophils, can be tuned toward antiviral defense by this <b>pharmacological</b> <b>molecule</b> that selectively binds chemokines with high affinity. These glycosaminoglycan mimetic features establish COAM as an immunomodulator and an interesting probe with the capacity to influence chemokine gradients and selectivity of leukocyte responses in vivo. Furthermore, COAM constitutes a novel tool to investigate how cells of the myeloid lineage, in particular neutrophils, can influence the pathogenesis of viral infections and other immunopathologies. As the field of viral immunology is rapidly evolving, comprehension concerning the mode of action of antiviral immunomodulators might reveal new concepts which may stimulate future exploration of new antiviral therapeutic strategies. nrpages: 186 status: publishe...|$|E

Availability of cells is an issue, for example when the cells originate from human biopsies or from (expensive!) transgenic mice. Apart from having reduced culture surfaces (for use with scarce biological tissues), there are tremendous advantages in having a cell culture mini-chamber. Our systems are with integrated electrical electrodes, micro-fluidic channels and feed-throughs, making them extremely compact and easy to use, thereby avoiding cell perturbation by manipulations.

Moreover we have chosen cheap and easy-to-tool materials for the realisation of disposable devices. We have also fabricated modular devices, in which the cell culture membranes can be reversibly placed within or removed from the system, thereby offering flexibility and economic interest. These microsystems (for biological applications ("biosystems")) are realised using photolithography, various etching procedures (among which powder-blasting), thin film deposition, electrochemical deposition, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) moulding and gluing technologies.

40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: The charge {{distribution}} of halogen atoms on organochlorine compounds {{can be highly}} anisotropic and even display a so-called σ-hole, which leads to strong halogen bonds with electron donors. In this paper, we have systematically investigated a series of chloromethanes with one to four chloro substituents using a polarizable multipole-based molecular mechanics model. The atomic multipoles accurately reproduced the ab initio electrostatic potential around chloromethanes, including CCl 4, which has a prominent σ-hole on the Cl atom. The van der Waals parameters for Cl were fitted to the experimental density and heat of vaporization. The calculated hydration free energy, solvent reaction fields, and interaction energies of several homo- and heterodimer of chloromethanes are in good agreement with experimental and ab initio data.

Simultaneously, study of the mutant receptors ex vivo was instrumental in delineating the relationships between the structure and function of these important physiological and <b>pharmacological</b> <b>molecules.</b> Now that access to the crystallographic structure of a few GPCRs is available, the mechanics of these receptors can be studied at the atomic level. Progress in the fields of cell biology, molecular pharmacology and proteomics has also widened our view of GPCR functions. Initially considered simply as guanine nucleotide exchange factors capable of activating G protein-dependent regulatory cascades, GPCRs are now known to display several additional characteristics, each susceptible to alterations by disease-causing mutations. These characteristics include functionally important basal activity of the receptor; differential activation of various G proteins; differential activation of G protein-dependent and independent effects (biased agonism); interaction with proteins that modify receptor function; dimerization-dependent effects; and interaction with allosteric modulators. This Review attempts to illustrate how natural mutations of GPCR could contribute {{to our understanding of the}}se novel facets of GPCR biology.

40|$|International audienceThe {{existence}} of unresponsive tumors {{and the appearance}} of resistant tumors during the course of treatments both justify that we increase urgently the panel of <b>pharmacological</b> <b>molecules</b> able to fight cancer. An interesting strategy is drug reprofiling (also known as drug repositioning, drug repurposing or drug retasking) that consists of identifying and developing new uses for existing drugs. This review illustrates drug reprofiling with troglitazone (TGZ), a synthetic PPARγ agonist initially used for the treatment of type II diabetes. The fact that TGZ also displays anticancer effects is known {{since the end of the}} nineties but its development as an anticancer agent was slowed down due to hepatotoxic side effects. Part of the knowledge available for TGZ, mainly the molecular basis for PPARγ activation, its metabolization pathways and the side effects on hepatocytes, were taken into account to elaborate new molecules. Key findings were that unsaturated TGZ derivatives, when compared to TGZ, do not activate PPARγ, exhibit a higher efficiency on cancer cells and a lower toxicity towards hepatocytes. However, a weakness is that the mechanisms involved in the anticancer effects are still not completely understood and that the efficiency of such derivatives has not yet been completely studied in vivo. Data about this point should become available very soon from animal models and this will be a prerequisite to initiate clinical trials with these potential new anticancer drugs developed from a drug repurposing strategy...|$|R
40|$|Voltage-gated ion {{channels}} are crucial for both neuronal and cardiac excitability. Decades of research {{have begun to}} unravel the intriguing machinery behind voltage sensitivity. Although the details regarding the arrangement and movement in the voltage-sensing domain are still debated, consensus is slowly emerging. There are three competing conceptual models: the helical-screw, the transporter, and the paddle model. In this review we explore {{the structure of the}} activated voltage-sensing domain based on the recent X-ray structure of a chimera between Kv 1. 2 and Kv 2. 1. We also present a model for the closed state. From this we conclude that upon depolarization the voltage sensor S 4 moves ~ 13 Å outwards and rotates ~ 180 º, thus consistent with the helical-screw model. S 4 also moves relative to S 3 b which is not consistent with the paddle model. One interesting feature of the voltage sensor is that it partially faces the lipid bilayer and therefore can interact both with the membrane itself and with physiological and <b>pharmacological</b> <b>molecules</b> reaching the channel from the membrane. This type of channel modulation is discussed together with other mechanisms for how voltage-sensitivity is modified. Small effects on voltage-sensitivity can have profound effects on excitability. Therefore, medical drugs designed to alter the voltage dependence offer an interesting way to regulate excitability. The original publication is available at www. springerlink. com: Sara I.

40|$|Significance: Reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) {{have long been}} {{considered}} as toxic derivatives of aerobic metabolism displaying a harmful effect to living cells. Deregulation of redox homeostasis and production of excessive free radicals {{may contribute to the}} pathogenesis of kidney diseases. In line, oxidative stress increases in patients with renal dysfunctions due to a general increase of ROS paralleled by impaired antioxidant ability. Recent Advances: Emerging evidence revealed that physiologically, ROS can act as signaling molecules interplaying with several transduction pathways such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. ROS can exert signaling functions by modulating, at different layers, protein oxidation since proteins have "cysteine switches" that can be reversibly reduced or oxidized, supporting the dynamic signaling regulation function. In this scenario, S-glutathionylation is a posttranslational modification involved in oxidative cellular response. Critical Issues: Although it is widely accepted that renal dysfunctions are often associated with altered redox signaling, the relative role of S-glutathionylation on the pathogenesis of specific renal diseases remains unclear and needs further investigations. In this review, we discuss the impact of ROS in renal health and diseases and the role of selective S-glutathionylation proteins potentially relevant to renal physiology. Future Directions: The paucity of studies linking the reversible protein glutathionylation with specific renal disorders remains unmet. The growing number of S-glutathionylated proteins indicates that this is a fascinating area of research. In this respect, further studies on the association of reversible glutathionylation with renal diseases, characterized by oxidative stress, may be useful to develop new <b>pharmacological</b> <b>molecules</b> targeting protein S-glutathionylation...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{discovery}} of new molecules with potential antitumor activity {{continues to be}} of great importance in cancer research. In this respect, natural antimicrobial peptides isolated from various animal species including humans and amphibians {{have been found to}} be of particular interest. Here, we report the presence of two anti-proliferative peptides active against cancer cells in the skin secretions of the South American tree frog, Phyllomedusa bicolor. The crude skin exudate was fractioned by size exclusion gel followed by reverse-phase HPLC chromatography. After these two purification steps, we identified two fractions that exhibited anti-proliferative activity. Sequence analysis indicated that this activity was due to two antimicrobial alpha-helical cationic peptides of the dermaseptin family (dermaseptins B 2 and B 3). This result was confirmed using synthetic dermaseptins. When tested in vitro, synthetic B 2 and B 3 dermaseptins inhibited the proliferation of the human prostatic adenocarcinoma PC- 3 cell line by more than 90 %, with an EC(50) of around 2 - 3 mu M. No effect was observed on the growth of the NIH- 3 T 3 non-tumor mouse cell line with Drs B 2, whereas a slight inhibiting effect was observed with Drs B 3 at high dose. In addition, the two fractions obtained after size exclusion chromatography also inhibited PC- 3 cell colony formation in soft agar. Interestingly, inhibition of the proliferation and differentiation of activated adult bovine aortic endothelial cells was observed in cells treated with these two fractions. Dermaseptins B 2 and B 3 could, therefore, represent interesting new <b>pharmacological</b> <b>molecules</b> with antitumor and angiostatic properties for the development of a new class of anticancer drugs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Multipotent {{stem cells}} exist within adipose tissue {{throughout}} life. An abnormal recruitment of these adipose precursor cells could participate to hyperplasia of adipose tissue observed in severe obesity or to hypoplasia of adipose tissue observed in lipodystrophy. Therefore, <b>pharmacological</b> <b>molecules</b> {{that control the}} pool of stem cells in adipose tissue are of great interest. Glycogen Synthase Kinase (GSK) 3 has been previously described as involved in differentiation of preadipose cells and might be a potential therapeutic target to modulate proliferation and differentiation of adipocyte precursors. However, the impact of GSK 3 inhibition on human adipose-derived stem cells remained to be investigated. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate GSK 3 as a possible target for pharmacological inhibition of stem cell adipogenesis. To reach this goal, we studied the effects of pharmacological inhibitors of GSK 3, i. e. lithium chloride (LiCl) and BIO on proliferation and adipocyte differentiation of multipotent stem cells derived from human adipose tissue. Results Our results showed that GSK 3 inhibitors inhibited proliferation and clonogenicity of human stem cells, strongly suggesting that GSK 3 inhibitors could be potent regulators of the pool of adipocyte precursors in adipose tissue. The impact of GSK 3 inhibition on differentiation of hMADS cells was also investigated. Adipogenic and osteogenic differentiations were inhibited upon hMADS treatment with BIO. Whereas a chronic treatment was required to inhibit osteogenesis, a treatment that was strictly restricted to the early step of differentiation was sufficient to inhibit adipogenesis. Conclusion These results demonstrated the feasibility of a pharmacological approach to regulate adipose-derived stem cell function and that GSK 3 could represent a potential target for controlling adipocyte precursor pool under conditions where fat tissue formation is impaired. </p...|$|R
