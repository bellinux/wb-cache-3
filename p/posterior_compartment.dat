2500|$|The {{sciatic nerve}} is formed from the L4 to S3 {{segments}} of the sacral plexus, a collection of nerve fibres that emerge from the sacral part of the spinal cord. The fibres unite to form a single nerve {{in front of the}} piriformis muscle. The nerve passes beneath piriformis and through the greater sciatic foramen, exiting the pelvis. From here, it travels down the posterior thigh to the popliteal fossa. The nerve travels in the <b>posterior</b> <b>compartment</b> of the thigh behind (superficial to) the adductor magnus muscle, and is itself in front of (deep to) one head of the biceps femoris muscle. At the popliteal fossa, the nerve divides into its two branches: ...|$|E
40|$|Although most {{mutations}} at the engrailed {{locus of}} Drosophila cause embryonic death when homozygous, they are viable in clones of cells. We describe the phenotype of such clones in the eye-antenna, proboscis, humerus, wing, legs, and terminalia. When in anterior compartments the clones are normal, {{but in most}} <b>posterior</b> <b>compartments</b> they are abnormal and fail to respect the anteroposterior compartment boundary. We find that the yield of engrailed-lethal clones in <b>posterior</b> <b>compartments</b> is often significantly lower than expected, indicating that these clones are lost during development. Mutant clones are abnormal in the analia and rare in the humerus, suggesting that both structures are of posterior provenance. These results {{support the hypothesis that}} the engrailed+ gene is required exclusively in cells of <b>posterior</b> <b>compartments</b> to specify their characteristic cell affinities and pattern...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{studied the}} cases of twelve {{patients}} who had bilateral exertional compartment syndrome in-volving one {{or all of the}} compartments of the lower extremities. The patients were divided into three groups based on the clinical findings. Group I consisted of seven patients with symptoms involving the anterior or lateral compartments only; Group II, of three patients with involvement of the deep <b>posterior</b> <b>compartments</b> alone; and Group III, of two patients with involvement of both the anterior and deep <b>posterior</b> <b>compartments.</b> On the basis of their clinical signs and symptoms each patient underwent dynamic tissue-pressure measurements using a slit catheter before, during, and for as long as thirty minutes after exercise. All patients had elevated resting and peak-to-peak dynamic pressure measurements...|$|R
2500|$|The {{striking}} segmented {{pattern of}} the spine is established during embryogenesis when somites are rhythmically added to the posterior of the embryo. Somite formation begins around the third week when the embryo begins gastrulation and continues until around 52 somites are formed. The somites are spheres, formed from the paraxial mesoderm {{that lies at the}} sides of the neural tube and they contain the precursors of spinal bone, the vertebrae ribs and some of the skull, as well as muscle, ligaments and skin. Somitogenesis and the subsequent distribution of somites is controlled by a clock and wavefront model acting in cells of the paraxial mesoderm. Soon after their formation, sclerotomes, which give rise to some of the bone of the skull, the vertebrae and ribs, migrate, leaving the remainder of the somite now termed a dermamyotome behind. This then splits to give the myotomes which will form the muscles and dermatomes which will form the skin of the back. [...] Sclerotomes become subdivided into an anterior and a <b>posterior</b> <b>compartment.</b> This subdivision {{plays a key role in}} the definitive patterning of vertebrae that form when the posterior part of one somite fuses to the anterior part of the consecutive somite during a process termed resegmentation. Disruption of the somitogenesis process in humans results in diseases such as congenital scoliosis. So [...] far, the human homologues of three genes associated to the mouse segmentation clock, (MESP2, DLL3 and LFNG), have been shown to be mutated in cases of congenital scoliosis, suggesting that the mechanisms involved in vertebral segmentation are conserved across vertebrates. In humans the first four somites are incorporated in the base of the occipital bone of the skull and the next 33 somites will form the vertebrae, ribs, muscles, ligaments and skin. The remaining posterior somites degenerate. During the fourth week of embryogenesis, the sclerotomes shift their position to surround the spinal cord and the notochord. This column of tissue has a segmented appearance, with alternating areas of dense and less dense areas.|$|E

40|$|The {{pelvic floor}} is an {{important}} structure, mandatory to maintain urinary and faecal continence and to prevent descent of pelvic viscera. Simultaneously it should also permit micturition, defaecation and sexual intercourse.

According to the related pelvic viscera, these disorders can be separated into three groups, which are the anterior, middle, and <b>posterior</b> pelvic <b>compartment</b> disorders. This thesis will evaluate the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the <b>posterior</b> pelvic <b>compartment.</b> It is mainly focussed on the outcome of different surgical modalities in the treatment of these <b>posterior</b> pelvic <b>compartment</b> disorders, in example the outcome of rectocele, enterocele, and rectovaginal fistula repair. In addition, the value of transperineal ultrasound in the assessment of <b>posterior</b> pelvic <b>compartment</b> prolapse is investigated.

The anterior and lateral lower-leg compartments were released through a lateral skin incision over the lateral intermuscular septum centered halfway between the fibular shaft and the tibia crest. The two <b>posterior</b> <b>compartments</b> were accessed through a second skin incision 2  cm posterior to the medial edge of the tibia. Anterior and <b>posterior</b> <b>compartments</b> of the thigh were adequately decompressed through a single lateral incision using the technique described by Tarlow et al. [13]. The superficial and deep volar compartments of the forearm were released through a single volar incision, extending from the biceps tendon at the elbow {{to the center of}} the wrist. Dorsal decompression was performed through a straight dorsal incision [14]. Compartment syndrome of the hand and foot were managed with two longitudinal dorsal incisions over the second and fourth metacarpals and metatarsals, respectively, to release all interosseous compartments [14, 15].|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground: Planar {{polarity}} {{refers to}} the asymmetry of a cell within {{the plane of the}} epithelium; for example, cells may form hairs that point in a posterior direction, or cilia may beat in one way. This property implies that cells have information about their orientation; we wish {{to understand the nature of}} this information. Relevant also is the body plan of insects, which, in the ectoderm and somatic mesoderm, consists of a chain of alternating anterior and <b>posterior</b> <b>compartments</b> — basic units of development with independent cell lineage and subject to independent genetic control. Results: Using the abdomen of adult Drosophila, we have taken genes required for normal polarity and either removed the gene or constitutively expressed it in small clones of cells and observed the effects on polarity. Hitherto, all such studies of polarity genes have not found any difference of behavior between the different compartments. We report here that the three genes, four-jointed, dachsous, and fat, cause opposite effects in anterior and <b>posterior</b> <b>compartments.</b> For example, in anterior compartments, clones ectopically expressing four-jointed reverse the polarity of cells in front of the clone, while, in <b>posterior</b> <b>compartments,</b> they reverse behind the clone. These three genes have been reported by others to be functionally linked. Conclusions: This discovery impacts on models of how cells read polarity. At the heart of one class of models is the hypothesis that cell polarity is determined by the vector of a morphogen gradient. Here, we present evidence that cell polarity in the abdomen depends on at least two protein gradients (Fj and Ds), each of which is reflected at compartment borders. Consequently, these gradients have opposing slopes in the two compartments. Because all polarized structures made by abdominal cells point posteriorly, we surmise that cells in each compartment are programmed to interpret these protein gradients with opposite signs, pointing up the gradient in one compartment and down the gradient in the other...|$|R
