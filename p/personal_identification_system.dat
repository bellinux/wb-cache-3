Many researches had proposed several methods to detect the pupil boundary.

But, the dark intensities of pupil are not fixed due to the coming lighting. Other iris segmentation methods which are used for iris recognition technology consider the boundary of pupil is a circle. But, the boundary of pupil is not quite circle and a small error in detecting this boundary will lead to lose some information surrounding the pupil. Another problem that makes most of the iris segmentation method fail to detect the pupil boundary is the head rotation or the eye rotation. As a result of these problems, the iris recognition system will be inefficient and inaccurate.
