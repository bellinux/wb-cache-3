50|$|Free base <b>propylhexedrine</b> is a volatile, oily liquid at room temperature. The slow {{vaporization}} of {{free base}} <b>propylhexedrine</b> {{allows it to}} be administered via inhalation. Acid salts of <b>propylhexedrine</b> (such as <b>propylhexedrine</b> HCl) often present as a stable, clear to off-white crystalline powder that readily dissolves in water.|$|E
50|$|<b>Propylhexedrine</b> is {{structurally}} {{similar to}} phenylethylamines, {{with the only}} structural difference being the substitution of an alicyclic cyclohexyl group for the aromatic phenyl group of phenethylamine. <b>Propylhexedrine</b> is not an amphetamine, nor even a phenethylamine, but instead {{can be referred to}} as a cycloalkylamine. <b>Propylhexedrine</b> is somewhat less potent than structurally similar amphetamines.|$|E
50|$|<b>Propylhexedrine</b> {{should not}} be used if an MAOI has been used in the past 14 days, or is being {{currently}} used, as this can lead to a hypertensive crisis. People with cardiac disease should not use <b>propylhexedrine.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Propylhexedrine</b> (Benzedrex, Obesin) or hexahydromethamphetamine is a {{stimulant}} drug. It is {{an analog}} of methamphetamine {{that is used}} medicinally as a nasal decongestant (for relief of congestion due to colds, allergies and allergic rhinitis) and recreationally for its psychostimulant effects. When used as a vasoconstrictor used to decongest nasal mucosa, it is administered by inhalation. <b>Propylhexedrine</b> is a structural analog of methamphetamine. The {{only difference is that}} <b>propylhexedrine</b> has a saturated cyclohexane ring where methamphetamine has a benzene ring.|$|E
50|$|<b>Propylhexedrine</b> is a TAAR1 agonist like amphetamine. Consequently, it {{reverses the}} {{transporters}} for dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin, {{leading to a}} release of monoamines from presynaptic vesicles into the synaptic cleft. The increased level of monoamines within the synapse results in increased activity at these receptors. Additionally, <b>propylhexedrine</b> appears to antagonize the VMAT2 transporter, leading to a further increase in the aforementioned monoamines. The pharmacological actions of <b>propylhexedrine</b> are {{similar to that of}} structurally similar stimulant phenethylamines, such as amphetamine.|$|E
50|$|Also <b>propylhexedrine</b> {{inhibits}} cytochrome c reductase.|$|E
50|$|Norpropylhexedrine is a {{metabolite}} of <b>propylhexedrine.</b>|$|E

50|$|There is {{one case}} of death where a {{combination}} of <b>propylhexedrine,</b> acetaminophen, morphine, promethazine, and kratom was detected. However the study indicates that kratom toxicity was not included {{as one of the}} causes of death and that <b>propylhexedrine</b> was the principal cause of death.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Propylhexedrine,</b> another ring {{substituted}} stimulant used as over-the-counter decongestant ...|$|E
5000|$|As nasal decongestants — e.g., levomethamphetamine, <b>propylhexedrine,</b> ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, {{phenylpropanolamine}} ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Propylhexedrine</b> has sympathomimetic, adrenergic, vasocontricive and {{psychostimulant}} effects {{when taken}} above the medical dosage. Effects include increased sweating, talkativeness, mydriasis, emotional lability, anorexia, tachycardia, palpitations, dry mouth, bruxism, anxiety, euphoria or dysphoria, increased aggressiveness, paranoia, headache, dizziness, psychosis, slurred or impaired speech, rarely convulsions and serious heart problems. <b>Propylhexedrine</b> {{can also cause}} swelling, dryness and irritation of mucous membranes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Propylhexedrine</b> {{undergoes}} metabolism to form various metabolites including norpropylhexedrine, cyclohexylacetoxime, cis- and trans-4-hydroxypropylhexedrine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Propylhexedrine</b> (Hexahydromethamphetamine, Obesin) is a {{stimulant}} medication, sold over-the-counter in the United States as {{the cold}} medication Benzedrex. The drug has also been used as an appetite suppressant in Europe. <b>Propylhexedrine</b> is not an amphetamine, though it is structurally similar; it is instead a cycloalkylamine, and thus has stimulant effects that are less potent than similarly structured amphetamines, such as methamphetamine.|$|E
50|$|While <b>propylhexedrine</b> {{is limited}} {{in a number of}} {{administration}} routes, attempts to extract the drug from the nasal inhaler and then inject it have been reported. Recreational use by intravenous injection (IV) is dangerous and could result in serious bodily harm or death. IV use of <b>propylhexedrine</b> is known to cause mild side-effects such as transient diplopia as well as some serious (and potentially fatal) effects such as brainstem dysfunction, and deaths have been recorded in the medical literature. Typically, recorded cases of IV use are prepared by forming <b>propylhexedrine</b> HCl in a solution with hydrochloric acid, the solution is then heated to evaporate and the resulting crystals are dissolved in water for injection.|$|E
50|$|Examples of NDRAs include phenethylamine, tyramine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, lisdexamfetamine, cathinone, methcathinone, <b>propylhexedrine,</b> phenmetrazine, pemoline, 4-methylaminorex, and benzylpiperazine.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Propylhexedrine</b> can be {{synthesized}} {{starting with}} cyclohexylacetone {{in a similar}} fashion to the phenylacetone synthesis of methamphetamine.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} the acyclic part of the molecule, both {{cyclopentamine}} and <b>propylhexedrine</b> {{are the same as}} methamphetamine, all three molecules containing the 2-methylaminopropyl side-chain. The difference between them is that whereas methamphetamine is an aromatic molecule containing a phenyl group, cyclopentamine and <b>propylhexedrine</b> are entirely aliphatic and contain no delocalized electrons at all. The effect that this has on potency is that the reduced alicyclic-alkylamines are weaker than unsaturated (meth)amphetamine.|$|E
50|$|When {{amphetamine}} {{became a}} controlled substance, it {{was replaced by}} <b>propylhexedrine.</b> <b>Propylhexedrine</b> was also manufactured by Smith, Kline and French and was marketed under the name Benzedrex. The Benzedrex inhaler is still available today, but is now manufactured by B.F. Ascher & Company, inc. In certain countries (e.g., the United States), levomethamphetamine is used as the active ingredient in certain brands of inhalers, such as Vicks VapoInhaler, which are sold over-the-counter.|$|E
50|$|Cycloalkylamines are {{chemical}} compounds featuring a cycloalkyl group and an amine. Some examples include <b>propylhexedrine,</b> cyclopentamine, cypenamine, and tranylcypromine.|$|E
50|$|However, more {{commonly}} <b>propylhexedrine</b> is prepared by reacting methamphetamine with Adams' catalyst, reducing methamphetamine's aromatic ring to a cyclohexyl moiety.|$|E
50|$|Cyclohexylacetone {{along with}} N-Methylformamide {{can be used}} to make racemic <b>propylhexedrine</b> in a similar fashion to the {{phenylacetone}} synthesis of methamphetamine.|$|E
5000|$|Serotonin, norepinephrine, and/or {{dopamine}} releasers: 4-methylaminorex (4-MAR), amphetamine, benzphetamine, cathine, cathinone, diethylcathinone, ephedrine, levmetamfetamine, lisdexamfetamine, MDMA ("Ecstasy"), methamphetamine, pemoline, phendimetrazine, phenethylamine (PEA), phentermine, <b>propylhexedrine,</b> pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine, tyramine.|$|E
50|$|Dopaminergic stimulants such as amphetamine, ephedrine, and <b>propylhexedrine</b> work by {{causing the}} release of {{dopamine}} and norepinephrine, along with (in some cases) blocking the reuptake of these neurotransmitters.|$|E
50|$|Cyclopentamine is the {{cyclopentane}} homolog of <b>propylhexedrine,</b> differing only {{in terms}} of the contracted ring size of a cyclopentane, containing one —CH2— unit less than the cyclohexyl group.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, {{drugs such}} as stimulants and {{sympathomimetics}} {{should not be taken}} along with <b>propylhexedrine,</b> as this can lead to potentially dangerous spikes in blood pressure and irregular heart rhythms.|$|E
50|$|<b>Propylhexedrine</b> is {{the active}} {{ingredient}} in Benzedrex inhalers. The user can swallow the cotton or extract it. It acts as a stimulant and can cause euphoria, music appreciation, and other effects, such as preventing the user from falling asleep.|$|E
50|$|Levopropylhexedrine (Eventin) is a {{psychostimulant}} {{used as an}} anorectic in Germany and {{patented by}} Smith Kline & French in 1947. It has also {{been used in the}} anticonvulsant preparation barbexaclone in combination with phenobarbital to offset sedation. Levopropylhexedrine is the S-enantiomer of <b>propylhexedrine.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Propylhexedrine</b> is a chiral {{compound}} (the α-carbon is chiral), {{and active}} ingredient contained in Benzedrex inhalers is racemic (RS)-propylhexedrine as the free base. (S)-Propylhexedrine, {{also known as}} levopropylhexedrine, {{is believed to be}} the more biologically active isomer of the two. (S)-Propylhexedrine can be synthesized from methamphetamine.|$|E
50|$|Prolintane (Catovit, Katovit, Promotil, Villescon) is a {{stimulant}} and norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor {{developed in}} the 1950s. It is closely related in chemical structure to other drugs such as pyrovalerone, MDPV, and <b>propylhexedrine</b> {{and it has a}} similar mechanism of action. Many cases of prolintane abuse have been reported.|$|E
50|$|<b>Propylhexedrine</b> {{has also}} seen use in Europe as an {{appetite}} suppressant under the trade name Obesin {{and in the}} anticonvulsant preparation barbexaclone its S-isomer (levopropylhexedrine or L-propylhexedrine) is bonded with phenobarbital {{for the purpose of}} offsetting the barbiturate-induced sedation. Levopropylhexedrine is also used as an anorectic under the brand name Eventin.|$|E
50|$|Cyclopentamine {{acts as a}} {{releasing}} agent of the catecholamine neurotransmitters norepinephrine (noradrenaline), epinephrine (adrenaline), and dopamine. Its effects on norepinephrine and epinephrine mediate its decongestant effects, while its effects on all three neurotransmitters are responsible for its stimulant properties. When ingested orally in sufficient quantities, cyclopentamine produces similar effects to amphetamine, methamphetamine, and <b>propylhexedrine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Propylhexedrine</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} to be used recreationally, obtained as free base from the cotton rods that Benzedrex inhalers contain. Because consuming compressed rods of cotton may prove to be difficult to pass through the digestive tract, most users tend to cut the rods into smaller pieces before consuming via oral ingestion (to be absorbed by the GI tract).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Propylhexedrine</b> is most {{commonly}} found in over-the-counter Benzedrex inhalers. Benzedrex was first manufactured by Smith, Kline and French after the Benzedrine inhaler, which contained racemic amphetamine, became unavailable following the placement of amphetamines on the US Schedule II status (highest abuse potential, yet with accepted medicinal uses). Benzedrex is currently manufactured by B.F. Ascher & Co. Inc. Pharmaceuticals.|$|E
50|$|Cyclopentamine (trade names Clopane, Cyclonarol, Cyclosal, Cyklosan, Nazett, Sinos, among others) is a {{sympathomimetic}} alkylamine, {{classified as}} a vasoconstrictor. Cyclopentamine was indicated {{in the past as}} an over-the-counter (OTC) medication for use as a nasal decongestant, notably in Europe and Australia, but has now been largely discontinued possibly due to the availability, effectiveness, and safety of a structurally similar drug, <b>propylhexedrine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The abuse {{potential}} of <b>propylhexedrine</b> is fairly limited, due its limited routes of administration: in the United States, Benzedrex is only available as an inhalant, mixed with lavender oil and menthol. These ingredients cause unpleasant tastes, and abusers {{of the drug}} have reported unpleasant [...] "menthol burps." [...] Injection of the drug {{has been found to}} cause transient diplopia and brain stem dysfunction.|$|E
