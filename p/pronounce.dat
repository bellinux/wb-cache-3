5|$|The Welsh {{also created}} a dish called Llymru, finely ground oatmeal soaked in water {{for a long time}} before boiling until it solidified.

A similar dish, sucan, was made with less finely ground oatmeal, making a coarser product.|$|E

5|$|As the plenary {{legislative}} {{powers of}} the Parliament were sufficient to grant extraterritorial legislative powers to the Parliament, the Court declined to <b>pronounce</b> whether Article 73(a) was an empowering provision.

5|$|Following Ruisdael's trip to Germany, his landscapes {{took on a}} more heroic character, with forms {{becoming}} {{larger and}} more prominent. A view of Bentheim Castle, dated 1653, {{is just one of}} a dozen of Ruisdael's depictions of a particular castle in Germany, almost all of which <b>pronounce</b> its position on a hilltop. Significantly, Ruisdael made numerous changes to the castle's setting (it is actually on an unimposing low hill) culminating in a 1653 version which shows it on a wooded mountain. These variations are considered by art historians to be evidence of Ruisdael's compositional skills.|$|E
5|$|When {{brain death}} is suspected, {{reversible}} differential diagnoses such as hypothermia-induced coma, electrolyte, neurological and drug-related cognitive suppression {{need to be}} excluded.

5|$|At the age of16, Buxton was illiterate, {{but with}} the aid of The Common Spelling Book he taught himself to read. He was unable to {{understand}} or <b>pronounce</b> all words correctly and so procured a copy of Jones Pronouncing Dictionary. He read more books, such as A History of England and Goldsmith's History of Greece and Rome. Reading occupied all his spare time, although when trade was good he had to work from 6:00am until 9:00pm. He earned about 14 to 15 shillings (70p-75p) a week, a good wage for the time, but as cloth was superseding leather in making the tops of children shoes, this did not last.|$|E

5|$|Black Sabbath {{was made}} {{at the end of}} {{production}} of The Girl Who Knew Too Much during an eight-week period between February and March 1963. American International Production's involvement with the film allowed Salvatore Billitteri of the Titra Sound Corporation to be on set to supervise the film for dubbing on its English-language release. As the film was going to be dubbed in different languages, actors could no longer phonetically <b>pronounce</b> their dialogue as {{it had to be done}} rhythmically to match various languages. Billitteri was also on set to give suggestions to Bava on how to make his film more appropriate for American audiences which led to decreasing the amount of violence in the film. The film was first conceived under the title The Fear.|$|E
5|$|Harvard had so {{much trouble}} finding a {{replacement}} for Gray that they considered hiring a European, but they found an American and hired George Lincoln Goodale in late 1872. Goodale had a medical degree from Harvard and a solid knowledge of botany. By late June 1873 Goodale had enough experience that Gray was exalted to <b>pronounce</b> he had taught his last class. William Gilson Farlow also had a medical degree from Harvard and had studied botany. He became Gray's assistant in 1870 after obtaining his medical degree and then studied in Europe for a few years. He returned to Harvard in 1874 and became a botany professor. Sereno Watson began helping Gray with taxonomy in 1872 and became the herbarium curator. The reorganization of botany at Harvard in the early 1870s was a major accomplishment of Gray's.|$|E
5|$|In {{the naming}} scheme as {{originally}} developed, these substems mostly {{consist of a}} consonant, a vowel, then another consonant. The final letter may be dropped if the resulting name {{would be difficult to}} <b>pronounce</b> otherwise. Examples include -ci(r)- for the circulatory system, -li(m)- for the immune system (lim stands for lymphocyte) and -ne(r)- for the nervous system. The final letter is usually omitted if the following source substem begins with a consonant (such as -zu- or -xi-), but not all target substems are used in their shortened form. -mul-, for example, is never reduced to -mu- because no chimeric or humanized antibodies targeting the musculoskeletal system ever received an INN. Combination of target and source substems results in endings like -limumab (immune system, human) or -ciximab (circulatory system, chimeric, consonant r dropped).|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{having taken}} Anne to France on a pre-nuptial honeymoon, Henry married her in Westminster Abbey in January 1533. This was made easier {{by the death}} of Archbishop Warham, a strong {{opponent}} of an annulment. Henry appointed Thomas Cranmer as his successor as Archbishop of Canterbury. Cranmer was prepared to grant the annulment of the marriage to Catherine as Henry required, {{going so far as to}} <b>pronounce</b> the judgment that Henry's marriage with Catherine was against the law of God on 23 May. Anne gave birth to a daughter, Princess Elizabeth, in September 1533. The Pope responded to the marriage by excommunicating both Henry and Cranmer from the Roman Catholic Church (11 July 1533). Henry was excommunicated again in December 1538.|$|E
5|$|The Cormier {{brothers}} were {{the sons of}} Edmond Cormier and Bernadette Doucette. They {{grew up on a}} farm in what is now Memramcook, New Brunswick. Four of the brothers had long careers as professional wrestlers, while a fifth, Malcolm Cormier, competed briefly before becoming a referee. None of the brothers wrestled under the family surname, however, as they all adopted ring names. One of the brothers explained that the brothers' real names were too hard to <b>pronounce,</b> so they adopted other names that were easier for international fans. Yvon Cormier was given the name The Beast, Jean-Louis was known as Rudy Kay, Leonce took the name Leo Burke, and Romeo competed as Bobby Kay. Malcolm, the oldest of the brothers involved in wrestling, used the name Mel Turnbow while working as a referee.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} losing the British Commonwealth Championship, Devitt signed a {{contract}} with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) in March 2006. In April 2006, he made his NJPW debut against El Samurai, using the ring name Prince Devitt. Devitt later stated in an interview with PowerSlam Mag that New Japan renamed him Prince Devitt because nobody Japanese could <b>pronounce</b> his actual name. He was originally going to be called King David, until people started questioning why the 24-year-old would be a king already. Eventually, Simon Inoki came up with the name Prince Devitt, which Devitt himself also preferred. In May 2006, New Japan started holding brandexclusive events, and Devitt was assigned to the Wrestle Land brand, debuting under a mask as the second Pegasus Kid, which led to comparisons between Devitt and the original Pegasus Kid, Chris Benoit.|$|E

5|$|After Archer {{recklessly}} foils an Irish terrorist's {{attempt to}} assassinate a British nobleman, Malory begins {{to suspect that}} Lana's feelings for her son are resurfacing. Hoping to readjust Lana's desires so they are steered towards her current boyfriend, Cyril, she asks Archer to train {{him to be a}} field agent. Archer is wise to their scheme though, and tries to set Cyril up to fail to sabotage his relationship with Lana, Archer's ex. At one point, Cyril inquiries about Archer’s lack of ethics, and ease of deception. To which Archer’s replies “lying is, like, 95% of what I do.” One of his sessions involves trying to kill an assassin (portrayed by Archer's butler, Woodhouse) and using a dance partner (played by a prostitute Archer has befriended) as a human shield. During the session, however, Cyril accidentally poisons the prostitute and both he and Archer <b>pronounce</b> her deceased.|$|E
5|$|At the palace, Nero tells Agrippina of his {{troubles}} {{and decides to}} renounce love for political ambition ("Come nube che fugge dal vento"). But Pallas and Narcissus have by now revealed Agrippina's original plot to Claudius, so that when Agrippina urges the Emperor to yield the throne to Nero, he accuses her of treachery. She then claims that her efforts to secure the throne for Nero had all along been a ruse to safeguard the throne for Claudius ("Se vuoi pace"). Claudius believes her; nevertheless, when Poppaea, Otho, and Nero arrive, Claudius announces that Nero and Poppaea will marry, and that Otho shall have the throne. No one is satisfied with this arrangement, as their desires have all changed, so Claudius {{in a spirit of}} reconciliation reverses his judgement, giving Poppaea to Otho and the throne to Nero. He then summons the goddess Juno, who descends to <b>pronounce</b> a general blessing ("V'accendano le tede i raggi delle stelle").|$|E
