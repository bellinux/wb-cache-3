5|$|As {{the trial}} against Ayala begins, his {{pregnant}} wife Helena (Zeta-Jones) learns of her husband's true profession from his associate, Arnie Metzger (Quaid). Facing the prospect of life imprisonment for her husband and death threats against her only child, Helena decides to hire Francisco Flores to assassinate Eduardo Ruiz; she knows killing Ruiz will effectively end the trial nolle prosequi. Flores <b>plants</b> <b>a</b> car bomb on a DEA car in an assassination attempt against Ruiz. Shortly after planting the bomb, Flores is assassinated by a sniper in retaliation for his cooperation with General Salazar. The car bomb meant to kill Ruiz instead kills Agent Castro, but Gordon and Ruiz survive.|$|E
5|$|By 6000 BC, {{the early}} {{inhabitants}} of Mesoamerica were experimenting with the domestication of <b>plants,</b> <b>a</b> process that {{eventually led to}} the establishment of sedentary agricultural societies. The diverse climate allowed for wide variation in available crops, but all regions of Mesoamerica cultivated the base crops of maize, beans, and squashes. All Mesoamerican cultures used Stone Age technology; after c. 1000 AD copper, silver and gold were worked. Mesoamerica lacked draft animals, did not use the wheel, and possessed few domesticated animals; the principal means of transport was on foot or by canoe.|$|E

Molybdenum enzymes in plants and animals catalyze the oxidation and sometimes reduction of certain small molecules {{in the process of}} regulating nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon.|$|E
5|$|Linnaeus felt Uppsala was {{too noisy}} and unhealthy, so he bought two farms in 1758: Hammarby and Sävja. The next year, {{he bought a}} {{neighbouring}} farm, Edeby. He spent the summers with his family at Hammarby; initially it only had a small one-storey house, but in 1762 a new, larger main building was added. In Hammarby, Linnaeus made a garden where he could grow plants {{that could not be}} grown in the Botanical Garden in Uppsala. He began constructing a museum on a hill behind Hammarby in 1766, where he moved his library and collection of <b>plants.</b> <b>A</b> fire that destroyed about one third of Uppsala and had threatened his residence there necessitated the move.|$|E

5|$|A {{historic}} Native American path used to {{pass through}} the water gap of Leggetts Creek on its way from the headwaters of the Lehigh River to the Great Bend on the Susquehanna River near the Pennsylvania/New York border. Some mining and quarrying operations have been done in the watershed and the Leggetts Gap Railroad was built through Leggetts Gap in the 19th century. In the late 19th, 20th, and early 21st centuries, numerous bridges were constructed across the creek. Wild trout naturally reproduce within the creek and several other species have been observed in its waters as well. Some reaches of the creek have a riparian buffer consisting of old growth forests. In other places, there are grasslands or invasive <b>plants.</b> <b>A</b> greenway/connecting trail along the creek was proposed in the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan.|$|E
5|$|After {{escaping}} the research station, Joanna agrees {{to work with}} the Carrington Institute to stop dataDyne. Daniel Carrington contacts her and explains that Zeigler had been working on an algorithm capable of decoding extraterrestrial glyphs at a dig site in South America. Traveling to Peru, Joanna learns that the glyphs are leading dataDyne to search for an ancient artefact which acts as a power-source for the Graal, a device which endows individuals with superhuman powers. Joanna <b>plants</b> <b>a</b> tracking device onto the artefact before sneaking aboard a dataDyne dropship. The dropship takes her to Africa, where Zhang Li has located the Graal buried under the African sands. The Carrington Institute plans an offensive on dataDyne forces with the battle taking place on a large bridge. Joanna rescues several Carrington Institute agents before avenging her father's death by killing Mei Hem. Joanna infiltrates an arena and faces off against Zhang Li, who dispatches Sekhar after using the Graal. Despite the advantage, Joanna defeats Zhang Li in a final battle. Daniel Carrington commends her efforts, informing her that she did “Perfect”.|$|E

Determined to steal the secrets of IR's Thunderbird machines, the Hood plots to have the Tracys called to a disaster situation of his own design. Travelling from his temple hideout in the Malaysian jungle to London International Airport, he <b>plants</b> <b>a</b> bomb next to the landing gear hydraulics of Air Terrainean's new Fireflash – an atomic-powered, hypersonic airliner departing for her maiden flight to Tokyo.

5|$|Discovering that Talbot {{has already}} confiscated the painting, Coulson agrees {{to meet with}} him after {{debriefing}} his team. Meanwhile, May follows Talbot, who is actually Hydra agent Sunil Bakshi using advanced technology to take on Talbot's voice and appearance. May is attacked by Agent 33, a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent brainwashed into Hydra's service, who knocks May unconscious and uses the same device to take on her voice and appearance. Agent 33 goes to the Bus, a S.H.I.E.L.D. plane being used as a mobile command center, where she secretly <b>plants</b> <b>a</b> computer virus before meeting with Coulson. Further discussing his contingency plan, in which May would kill Coulson and replace him as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Coulson deduces that Agent 33 is not May and turns on her; this draws the attention of Bakshi, who was ready to torture May to gain S.H.I.E.L.D. secrets.|$|E

5|$|Goods {{traffic was}} more substantial, with fruit, hops and timber being sent out and coal being received. The 1937 {{timetable}} showed two down freight workings from Paddock Wood and one conditional working for Goudhurst, {{while in the}} other direction two conditional workings ran from Hawkhurst and one from Goudhurst. These were market trains and carried wagons for Blackfriars Goods attached to freight services at Paddock Wood. The volume of goods carried fell into steep decline after the Second World War as more and more freight was taken to market by road. Coal traffic remained constant as did the transport of pot plants from local nurseries at Flimwell and Wadhurst for F W Woolworth. This was an important source of revenue for the line with one million pot <b>plants</b> <b>a</b> year being transported from Hawkhurst, bringing in around £1,000 per week.

5|$|Selenium is most {{commonly}} produced from selenide in many sulfide ores, {{such as those}} of copper, nickel, or lead. Electrolytic metal refining is particularly productive of selenium as a byproduct, obtained from the anode mud of copper refineries. Another source was the mud from the lead chambers of sulfuric acid <b>plants,</b> <b>a</b> process that is no longer used. Selenium can be refined from these muds by a number of methods. However, most elemental selenium comes as a byproduct of refining copper or producing sulfuric acid. Since its invention, solvent extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW) production of copper produces an increasing share of the worldwide copper supply. This changes the availability of selenium because only a comparably small part of the selenium in the ore is leached with the copper.|$|E
