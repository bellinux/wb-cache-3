2500|$|An {{important}} factor in the creation of inequality is variation in individuals' access to education. Education, especially in an area where there is a high demand for workers, creates high wages for those with this education, [...] however, increases in education first increase and then decrease growth as well as income inequality. As a result, those who are unable to afford an education, or choose not to pursue optional education, generally receive much lower wages. The justification for this is that a lack of education leads directly to lower incomes, and thus lower aggregate savings and investment. Conversely, education raises incomes and promotes growth because it helps to unleash the <b>productive</b> <b>potential</b> of the poor.|$|E
40|$|As {{one of the}} {{important}} non-grain energy crops, sweet sorghum has attracted the attention of scientific community and decision makers of the world since decades. But insufficient study has been done about the spatial suitability distribution and ethanol potential of sweet sorghum in China. This paper attempts to probe into the spatial distribution and ethanol potential of sweet sorghum in China by ArcGIS methods. Data used for the analysis include the spatial data of climate, soil, topography and land use, and literatures relevant for sweet sorghum studies. The results show that although sweet sorghum can be planted in the majority of lands in China, the suitable unused lands for large-scale planting (unit area not less than 100 Â hm 2) are only as much as 78. 6 Â xÂ  104 Â hm 2; and the <b>productive</b> <b>potentials</b> of ethanol from these lands are 157. 1 Â xÂ  104 - 294. 6 Â xÂ  104 Â t/year, which can only meet 24. 8 - 46. 4 % of current demand for E 10 (gasoline mixed with 10 % ethanol) in China (assumption of the energy efficiency of E 10 is equivalent to that of pure petroleum). If all the common grain sorghum at present were replaced by sweet sorghum, the average ethanol yield of 244. 0 Â xÂ  104 Â t/year can be added, and thus the <b>productive</b> <b>potentials</b> of sweet sorghum ethanol can satisfy 63. 2 - 84. 9 % of current demand for E 10 of China. In general, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Inner Mongolia and Liaoning rank the highest in <b>productive</b> <b>potentials</b> of sweet sorghum ethanol, followed by Hebei, Shanxi, Sichuan, and some other provinces. It is suggested that these regions should be regarded as the priority development zones for sweet sorghum ethanol in China.

40|$|This paper aims to {{contribute}} to improving {{our understanding of the}} societal determinants of productive ageing beyond formal employment. Based on data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) and applying logistic multilevel models, our analysis shows that {{a substantial portion of the}} variance between the eleven countries in our study with regard to private engagement in volunteering, informal helping, and caring is due to differences in population composition. In addition, the three macro-level indicators in our study contribute to a further substantial reduction in the between-country variance. While societal images of ageing do not bear a statistically significant association with volunteer work, informal help, or care, our hypotheses concerning a positive relationship between greater political and religious freedom as well as welfare state services and older individuals’ propensity to engage in informal productive activities are largely confirmed. We close with conclusions relevant for social policy and social science, regarding the activation of so far unused <b>productive</b> <b>potentials</b> in the elder population. ...|$|R

Among the fertility constraints identified were low effective cation exchange capacity and soil acidification.

Liming together with incorporation of organic materials into the soils were the measures needed to enhance their effective cation exchange capacity. Soil erosion control was to be given high priority especially by maintaining adequate surface cover and ensuring that tillage was limited to only when soil was drier than the plastic limit...|$|R

From international organizations it was suggested to promote it in order to ensure global food security. However, there are few studies that analyze its <b>productive</b> <b>potentials</b> and the practices that they carried out. 							This work has as general objective to provide empirical evidence about the different levels of efficiency in family farming and production practices, to obtain clues linked to a family of high-efficiency agriculture production. The study was conducted in the town of Maimará, Province of Jujuy. The research was at the first mainly quantitative, where the econometric method Data Envelopment Analysis, was used to estimate the relative productive efficiency of farms. The second stage seek to account for productive practices associated with efficiency levels identified. In these stage a more qualitative approach was used, taking four cases of studies. The results indicate that productivity in the area of Maimará could be increased by 30 % without altering the level of inputs used. The analysis also shows that efficiency levels identified are unrelated to higher rates of harvested area, capital, technology, infrastructure and natural resources; somehow the most differentiating power input is labor. Regarding to productive practices, it was not found in them evidence to explain the levels of efficiency, though it is considered that it would be feasible to think about that the different motivations and objectives of farmers the elements that may eventually provide greater explanatory potential.

The treatment groups were; feeds with concentrate only (T 1), concentrate and 50 g of plantain peel meal (T 2), and concentrate with 100 g of plantain peel meal (T 3). The data generated were analyzed using SPSS software packages. Parameters measured including body weight gain, feed efficiency, shell length, shell circumference, groove diameters and the sensory attribute. Results obtained in the stuffy snail fed with concentrate with 100 g of plantain peel meal performed best in all parameters assessed with values of average weight gain of (177. 00 g), average shell length (12. 60 g), groove diameter (8. 10) and shell circumference (18. 50 g) respectively.

40|$|Examining {{a diverse}} set of Asian American {{literary}} texts, this project explores {{the ways in}} which discourses of race, gender, class, sexuality and citizenship shape the articulation of emotions in Asian American Literature. While figures of the angry black man, the Latino gangster, and the Native American warrior abound in dominant American cultural narratives, Asian Americans have been constructed as the polar opposite: subdued, submissive, and accommodating. The figure of the angry Asian American remains a void in the dominant American cultural imaginary. One of the goals of this project is to interrogate and problematize the roots and implications of this absence. Placing anger within the historical, social and political contexts of war, colonialism, immigration and U. S. identity politics, I approach anger as a discourse that informs and shapes knowledge production and subject formation. The following questions animate my discussions: How is anger made legible in Asian American texts? What does anger suggest about {{the ways in which}} Asian Americans have been formed as subjects? How does anger complicate the notion of Asian American domesticity? Via a comparative study of Chang-rae Lee's A Gesture Life and lê thi diem thúy's The Gangster We are All Looking For, chapter one examines the inextricable connection between Asian Americans anger and the model minority myth. Chapter two, by means of discussing David Mura's memoirs Turning Japanese: Memoirs of a Sansei and Where the Body Meets Memory: An Odyssey of Race, Sexuality and Identity, investigates the relationship between anger and Asian American masculinity. Examining Monqiue Truong's The Book of Salt and Susan Choi's American Woman, chapter three builds on recent scholarship on notions of melancholia and loss to explore anger's <b>productive</b> <b>potentials.</b> The discussion of anger's productive possibilities and limitations is extended in chapter four, which traces a genealogy of Chinese American women's anger in Jade Snow Wong's Fifth Chinese Daughter, Maxine Hong Kingston's The Woman Warrior and Shirley Geok-lin Lim's Among the White Moon Faces: An Asian-American Memoir of Homelands...|$|R
