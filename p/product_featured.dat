5|$|Although it {{wound up}} being {{faithful}} to the comics, many designs were made for Spider-Man's costumes: one concept costume designer James Acheson became fond {{of the idea of}} having a red emblem over a black costume. Another, which would eventually lead to the final <b>product,</b> <b>featured</b> an enlarged logo on the chest and red stripes going down the sides of the legs. To create Spider-Man's costume, Maguire was fitted for the skintight suit, being covered with layers of substance to create the suit's shape. It was designed as a single piece, except for the mask. The webbing, which accented the costume, was cut by computer. The mask eye lenses were designed to have a mirror look.|$|E

The product was the first variant of BK Chicken Fries added to the company's menu. In developing the product, Burger King's chief marketing officer stated that once taste testers described the product as [...] "spicy as shit", the company realized it had the correct spice mix. Sale of the product would be limited to a one-month period, but the company stated if sales were successful enough it would consider extending the availability beyond the initial time frame.|$|E
40|$|The {{acquisition}} and mining of <b>product</b> <b>feature</b> data from on-line {{sources such as}} customer review websites and large scale social media networks is an emerging area of research. In many existing design methodologies that acquire <b>product</b> <b>feature</b> pref-erences form online sources, the underlying assumption is that <b>product</b> <b>features</b> expressed by customers are explicitly stated and readily observable to be mined using <b>product</b> <b>feature</b> extraction tools. In many scenarios however, <b>product</b> <b>feature</b> preferences expressed by customers are implicit in nature and do not directly map to engineering design targets. For example, a customer may implicitly state “wow I have to squint to read this on the screen”, when the explicit <b>product</b> <b>feature</b> may be a larger screen. The au-thors of this work propose an inference model that automatically assigns the most probable explicit <b>product</b> <b>feature</b> desired by a customer, given an implicit preference expressed. The algorithm iteratively refines its inference model by presenting a hypothesis and using ground truth data, determining its statistical validity. A case study involving smartphone <b>product</b> <b>features</b> expressed through Twitter networks is presented to demonstrate the effec-tiveness of the proposed methodology. ...|$|R

In this work, we propose a linear regression based approach to ranking <b>product</b> <b>features</b> according to their importance. Empirical experiments show our approach is effective and promising. We also demonstrate two applications using our <b>product</b> <b>feature</b> ranking approach.

500|$|The 2014 {{reintroduction}} of the <b>product</b> <b>featured</b> a {{first for}} the company, a primarily digital-focused promotion headed by the company's online media agency Code and Theory. To start off the promotion, the company announced the forthcoming reintroduction {{a few weeks before}} the product was set to be released with the simple tweet [...] "You asked. We answered. ChickenFriesAreBack." [...] The company also expanded its social media footprint specifically for the Chicken Fries promotion, adding new Tumblr and Snapchat accounts to their stable of social media outlets. The idea behind the large social media push was monetary, instead of spending capital on a traditional multi-week, multi-media advertising campaign the company would have product-loyalists spread the word at a fraction of the cost of traditional advertising.|$|E

In this research, we investigated unsupervised and supervised learning by incorporating linguistic rules and constraints that could improve the performance of calculations and classifications. In the unsupervised learning, sentiment scores of <b>product</b> <b>features</b> were calculated by aggregating opinion polarities of opinion words that were around the <b>product</b> <b>features.</b> In the supervised learning, feature spaces that contained right <b>features</b> for <b>product</b> <b>feature</b> based sentiment analysis were constructed. To reduce the dimensions of feature spaces, feature selection methods, Information Gain (IG) and Mutual Information (MI), were applied and compared. The results show that (i) product featureswere good indicators in determining the polarity classifications of document or sentences; (ii) rule based features could perform well in supervised learning e; and (iii) IG performed better in document analysis, while MI performed better in sentence-level analysis.
