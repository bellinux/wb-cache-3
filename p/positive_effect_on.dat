The samples of this study are 25 manufacturing companies and they were selected by using purposive sampling method. The data is collected through non participants’ observation. Path analysis which is an extension of the multiple linear regression technique is used to analyze data.

It refuses the negative hypothesis, free cash flow has <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> dividend policy, investment opportunity set has <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> firm value, free cash flow has <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> firm value, dividend policy has <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> firm value, investment opportunity set has <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> firm value  through dividend  policy  and free  cash flow has no  <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> firm value  through  dividend   policy...|$|R
30|$|In summary, {{there is}} {{evidence}} that land titling programs have <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> housing investments, negative <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> household size, and <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> child education. <b>Effects</b> <b>on</b> the labor market are not conclusive. There is weak support for the hypothesis that land titling can have <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> capital investment because the dwelling can be used as collateral. The reason could be due to the very limited access of slum dwellers to the credit market. Another reason could be that the high legal costs of eviction and executing a mortgage might preclude mortgaged credit (Galiani and Schargrodsky 2011).|$|R

After a home loss in the Clássico, the team's results became poorer, with three draws and two losses that caused the team to drop to third place by New Year. Benfica continued to slip in January, losing the Lisbon derby and twice dropping to fifth place. A home win against Sporting CP for the Portuguese Cup had an apparent <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the players; their best period all season came as they regained first place and opened a six-point lead over the team in second place.|$|E

Dorset's three ports, Poole, Weymouth and Portland, and the smaller harbours of Christchurch, Swanage, Lyme Regis, Wareham and West Bay generate {{a substantial amount of}} international trade and tourism. Around 230 fishing vessels that predominantly catch crab and lobster are based in Dorset's ports. When the waters around Weymouth and Portland were chosen for the sailing events in the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, the area underwent an increased investment in infrastructure and a growth in the marine leisure sector. It is expected that this will continue to have a <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> local businesses and tourism.|$|E

40|$|This study {{proposed}} and tested a theoretical model consisting of antecedents {{and consequences of}} recovery satisfaction using scenario experimentation with three dimensions of justice manipulated at two levels each (2 x 2 x 2 factorial design). Each participant was provided the same service failure (overcooked steak) scenario {{and one of the}} eight recovery scenarios (a combination of dimensions of justice). Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypotheses based on 286 cases. All three dimensions of justice had <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> recovery satisfaction. Recovery satisfaction had <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> trust and overall satisfaction. Trust had <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> commitment and overall satisfaction. Commitment had <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> overall satisfaction and behavioral intentions. Although a service failure might negatively affect customers' relationship with the service provider, effective recovery can reinforce attitudinal and behavioral outcomes. The study findings emphasized that recovery efforts should be viewed not only as a strategy to recover immediate satisfaction but also as a relationship tool to build long-term relationships with customers...|$|R

It was felt that the pier would have a <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> property values in the town, so the pier was approved.

In the study, the subjects (27 people ages 18 to 72) drank a cocoa drink containing 900 milligrams of flavonols every day, which resulted in an improvement in blood flow and the function of endothelial cells that line blood vessels.|$|E

Long-term hospitalization is uncommon since deinstitutionalization beginning in the 1950s, although it still occurs. Community support services including drop-in centers, visits by members of a community mental health team, supported employment and support groups are common.

Although there were no casualties on land, two fishermen navigating through the storm never returned to port in Boa Vista and were presumed dead. Despite the losses in crops and livestock, rainfall from Fred had a generally <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the larger-scale agriculture of the islands, refilling many rivers and dams and irrigating drought-stricken farmland across the Sotavento region.|$|E

That deluge of western aid was a byproduct of the disaster that {{may have had a}} <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> Soviet Union–United States relations. The cost of rebuilding would be a severe obstacle for Perestroika, Gorbachev's plan for economic restructuring.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 3 - 4 decades, {{numerous}} studies have been published evaluating interventions targeted at healthcare providers, at patients, or at both patients and healthcare providers, which are designed to, in some fashion, improve the provider-patient relationship and thereby enhance patient health outcomes. This article synthesizes findings from 14 literature reviews of relevant studies published between 1991 and 2007. Findings indicate that interventions aimed at physicians and other providers have consistently produced <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> provider communication behaviors and interpersonal skills. However, only moderately <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> patient satisfaction, and limited impact on patient healthcare behaviors such as compliance, appointment adherence, and resource use were found. <b>Effects</b> <b>on</b> primary medical outcomes were minimal although some <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> secondary medical outcomes such as quality of life were obtained. Patient-targeted interventions also showed consistently <b>positive</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> patient-physician communication in addition to enhanced patient participation in decision making. <b>Effects</b> <b>on</b> patient primary medical outcomes were limited, and weak <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> patient satisfaction were obtained. Characteristics of studies and training programs that may have influenced outcomes are discussed, as are practical impediments to promoting better physician-patient communication in clinical practice. ...|$|R

5|$|The battle {{had shown}} the {{potential}} of the Soviet armies to successfully conduct an offensive. This battle can be seen {{as one of the first}} major instances in which the Soviets attempted to preempt a German summer offensive. This later unfolded and grew as Stavka planned and conducted Operation Mars, Operation Uranus and Operation Saturn. Although only two of the three were victories, it still offers concise and telling evidence of the ability of the Soviets to turn the war in their favor. This finalised itself after the Battle of Kursk in July 1943. The Second Battle of Kharkov also had a <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> Stalin, who started to trust his commanders and his Chief of Staff more (allowing the latter to have the last word in naming front commanders for instance). After the great purge in 1937, failing to anticipate the war in 1941, and underestimating German military power in 1942, Stalin finally fully trusted his military.|$|E
5|$|The {{predicted}} {{effects of}} the FairTax {{are a source of}} disagreement among economists and other analysts. According to Money magazine, while many economists and tax experts support the idea of a consumption tax, many of them view the FairTax proposal as having serious problems with evasion and revenue neutrality. Some economists argue that a consumption tax (the FairTax is one such tax) would have a <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> economic growth, incentives for international business to locate in the U.S., and increased U.S. international competitiveness (border tax adjustment in global trade). The FairTax would be tax-free on mortgage interest (up to a basic interest rate) and donations, but some lawmakers have concerns about losing tax incentives on home ownership and charitable contributions. There is also concern about the effect on the income tax industry and the difficulty of repealing the Sixteenth Amendment (to prevent Congress from re-introducing an income tax).|$|E
