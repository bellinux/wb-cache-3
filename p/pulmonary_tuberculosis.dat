40|$|Background: Rapid new {{diagnostic}} methods (including Xpert MTB/RIF assay) use rifampicin resistance as {{a surrogate}} marker for multidrug resistant tuberculosis. Patients infected with rifampicin susceptible strains are prescribed first line anti-tuberculosis therapy. The roll out of such methods raises a concern that strains with resistance to other first line anti-tuberculosis drugs including isoniazid will be missed and inappropriate treatment given. To evaluate implications of using such methods review of resistance data from high burden settings such as ours is essential. Objective: To determine resistance to first line anti-tuberculosis drugs amongst rifampicin susceptible <b>pulmonary</b> Mycobacterium <b>tuberculosis</b> (MTB) isolates from Pakistan. Materials and Methods: Data of <b>pulmonary</b> Mycobacterium <b>tuberculosis</b> strains isolated in Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) laboratory (2009 – 2011) was retrospectively analyzed.

40|$|Background and Aims: This study aims at {{evaluating}} the clinical and radiological outcome of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) patients with <b>pulmonary</b> miliary <b>tuberculosis.</b> Mate-rial and Methods: Diagnosis of TBM {{was based on}} clinical, CT scan or MRI and CSF criteria, and that of miliary tuber-culosis on chest radiograph. Detailed clinical evaluation was done in all. Severity of meningitis was graded into Grades I, II and III. Complete hemogram, serum chemistry and Montaux tests were performed. The recovery was defined {{on the basis of}} 6 months Barthel index score as poor, partial or complete. Results: 20 out of 165 patients with TBM had <b>pulmonary</b> miliary <b>tuberculosis.</b> Their mean age was 30 years; there was one child and 13 patients were females. The mean duration of symptoms was 6. 3 months. Montoux test was negative in 9 patients. Six patients were in stage I, 3 in stage II, and 11 in stage III meningitis. Hemoglobin was below 12 gm % in 13 and liver dysfunction and hypocalcae-mia was present in 8 and 18 patients respectively. CT scan was abnormal in 16 patients and revealed hydrocephalus (10), granuloma (7), exudates (3) and infarction (1). MRI was abnormal in 7 out of 8 patients and 3 of these patients had normal CT scan. MRI revealed multiple granuloma in 7 patients and exudates in 2. At 6 months, 2 patients died, 10 had complete, 2 had partial and 4 had poor recovery.

40|$|Abstract Background The health {{impacts of}} <b>pulmonary</b> {{impairment}} after <b>tuberculosis</b> (TB) treatment {{have not been}} included in assessments of TB burden. Therefore, previous global and national TB burden estimates {{do not reflect the}} full consequences of surviving TB. We assessed the burden of TB including <b>pulmonary</b> impairment after <b>tuberculosis</b> in Tarrant County, Texas using Disability-adjusted Life Years (DALYs). Methods TB burden was calculated for all culture-confirmed TB patients treated at Tarrant County Public Health between January 2005 and December 2006 using identical methods and life tables as the Global Burden of Disease Study. Years of life-lost were calculated as the difference between life expectancy using standardized life tables and age-at-death from TB. Years lived-with-disability were calculated from age and gender-specific TB disease incidence using published disability weights. Non-fatal health impacts of TB were divided into years lived-with-disability-acute and years lived-with-disability-chronic. Years lived-with-disability-acute was defined as TB burden resulting from illness prior to completion of treatment including the burden from treatment-related side effects. Years lived-with-disability-chronic was defined as TB burden from disability resulting from <b>pulmonary</b> impairment after <b>tuberculosis.</b> Results There were 224 TB cases in the time period, of these 177 were culture confirmed. These 177 subjects lost a total of 1189 DALYs. Of these 1189 DALYs 23 % were from years of life-lost, 2 % were from years lived-with-disability-acute and 75 % were from years lived-with-disability-chronic. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that the disease burden from TB is greater than previously estimated. <b>Pulmonary</b> impairment after <b>tuberculosis</b> was responsible {{for the majority of the}} burden. These data demonstrate that successful TB control efforts may reduce the health burden more than previously recognized. </p...|$|R
