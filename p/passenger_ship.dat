This paper demonstrates how shipping companies can reduce costs by optimizing <b>passenger</b> <b>ships</b> and crew size. It analyzes operating conditions for each shipping depot, including transit time, ships, and volume of passengers. A series of integer programming models is proposed. After a practical demonstration using Excel to solve the LP model, we show that {{the reduction in the}} number of <b>passenger</b> <b>ships</b> and crew size could reach 22. 6 % and 29. 4 %, respectively...|$|R
5|$|She was {{assigned}} to the Channel Fleet in mid-1889 as a flagship for the fleet's second-in-command. Two years later, Anson accidentally sank a <b>passenger</b> <b>ship</b> when the latter broke loose from her anchors during a strong storm and collided with her. The ship was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in mid-1893 and returned home in 1900 when she {{was assigned}} to the Reserve Fleet. She recommissioned for the Home Fleet in early 1901. Anson was paid off three years later and then sold for scrap in 1909.|$|E
5|$|Thrust is {{provided}} by four Rolls-Royce Mermaid azimuth thruster type podded propulsion units, each featuring one forward-facing low-vibration propeller with separately bolted blades. The forward pair of thrusters is fixed, but the aft pair can swivel through 360°, removing {{the need for a}} rudder. The Queen Mary 2 is the first quadruple-propeller <b>passenger</b> <b>ship</b> completed since the SS France in 1961. Queen Mary 2 carries eight spare blades on the foredeck, immediately forward of the bridge screen.|$|E
5|$|As {{invasion}} neared in mid-1944, the two battalions {{moved from}} their camps to ports in southern England and embarked aboard troopships and landing ship tanks. Much of the Liverpool Irish embarked aboard the Ulster Monarch, a <b>passenger</b> <b>ship</b> that had {{served on the}} Belfast-Liverpool line before the war. Having been delayed, the invasion fleet proceeded to Normandy on 5 June. Both King's battalions landed on D-Day, the 5th at Sword with the 3rd British Infantry Division and the Liverpool Irish at Juno with the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division.|$|E

5|$|Nairana was {{returned}} to her former owners in 1921 and refitted in her original planned configuration, {{and spent the next}} 27 years ferrying passengers and cargo between Tasmania and Melbourne. She was twice struck by rogue waves in Bass Strait, and nearly capsized on both occasions. Nairana was the only Bass Strait ferry not requisitioned for military service in the Second World War, and so became the sole <b>passenger</b> <b>ship</b> with service to Tasmania during the conflict. She was laid up in 1948, wrecked in a storm three years later and scrapped in situ in 1953–54.|$|E
5|$|Provence {{was then}} sent to Casablanca, where she joined Force Y. The unit {{conducted}} several fruitless sweeps into the Atlantic. While in Gibraltar, she was damaged and forced to return to Toulon for repairs. While en route, she intercepted the Italian <b>passenger</b> <b>ship</b> Oceania; Provence dispatched her to Marseilles so she could be inspected for contraband. Provence sailed for Oran on 24 January 1940, {{and then returned to}} Force Y in Dakar. Force Y was transferred to Oran on 11 April; they arrived five days later. On 27 April, Provence, her two sisters, and several cruisers were moved to Alexandria. On 18 May, Provence and Bretagne returned to Mers El Kébir.|$|E
5|$|RML ordered Magdalena in 1946. Her keel {{had been}} laid by 8 October when Harland and Wolff applied for a {{passenger}} certificate for the ship.

5|$|SS Great Britain is {{a museum}} ship and former {{passenger}} steamship, which was advanced for her time. She {{was the longest}} <b>passenger</b> <b>ship</b> in the world from 1845 to 1854. She was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel for the Great Western Steamship Company's transatlantic service between Bristol and New York. While other ships had been built of iron or equipped with a screw propeller, Great Britain {{was the first to}} combine these features in a large ocean-going ship. She was the first iron steamer to cross the Atlantic, which she did in 1845, in the time of 14 days.|$|E
5|$|Scharnhorst was a <b>passenger</b> <b>ship</b> {{operated}} by Norddeutscher Lloyd in the 1930s. She {{was trapped in}} Japan after the outbreak of World War II in Europe in September 1939. The Japanese Navy purchased the ship on 7 February 1942, under the agreement they would pay Norddeutscher Lloyd twice {{the value of the}} ship {{after the end of the}} war. The ship was intended for use as a troop ship, but after the Japanese defeat at the Battle of Midway, the Navy decided to convert her into an escort carrier.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} based on the {{incomplete}} hull of the Italian <b>passenger</b> <b>ship</b> Ausonia, which was being built in Hamburg. The conversion was proposed by the Air Department of the Reichs Navy Office, but it was abandoned after negotiations within the German Navy over a proposed moratorium on new ships {{at the end of the}} war. After World War I ended, high inflation in Germany added to the cost of the ship, and as a result, the Italian shipping company for whom the ship was originally built, declined to purchase her. The vessel was therefore sold to shipbreakers and dismantled in 1922.|$|E

5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) lies {{unconscious}} {{in the sea}} after wrecking his raft. He {{is taken}} aboard a <b>passenger</b> <b>ship,</b> the Queen Anne, by its British crew members. When he is sent to meet the captain, Mulder tries to explain that the Queen Anne vanished in the Bermuda Triangle in 1939, and claims that it has reappeared in 1998. The crew dismisses Mulder's story and suspect he is a Nazi spy. At that moment, the Queen Anne is boarded by SS troops {{under the control of}} a Oberführer resembling The Smoking Man (William B. Davis), who sets the ship's course for Nazi Germany. The crew of the Queen Anne lock Mulder in the captain's quarters, where he listens to a radio broadcast announcing the start of World War II. Mulder realizes that the Queen Anne did not travel to 1998: he has traveled back to 1939.|$|E
5|$|On November6, storm {{warnings}} {{were posted}} in Samar, Leyte, {{and much of}} the Visayas chain, as well as, for the Bicol Peninsula on Luzon, which was just reeling from the effects of Typhoon Ruby and Tropical Storm Tess, in preparation for the typhoon. The next day, this alert was expanded into the northeastern provinces of Mindanao Island. Simultaneously, a lower level alert was issued for half of Luzon, including the capital of Manila. Small crafts were ordered to stay at port. Philippine Airlines canceled 75domestic flights as the storm approached. The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) suspended all <b>passenger</b> <b>ship</b> service to ports in the Visayas Islands on November6, stranding thousands of passengers in Manila and other major ports throughout the nation. Select Military Airlift Command flights to Japan and the United States left early to avoid the core of the typhoon. The city of Manila ordered all schools to close for a day.|$|E
5|$|She was {{launched}} as the <b>passenger</b> <b>ship</b> Ausonia on 15 April 1915. While {{the ship was}} still being fitted out, the German navy decided to convert her into an aircraft carrier. The proposed design was completed by 1918, but by then, the majority of naval construction efforts were diverted to building new U-boats. The demands on labor and resources the war imposed on the German economy reduced the shipbuilding industry to barely being able to cover the maintenance and repair needs of the High Seas Fleet. What resources were left over were by 1918 funneled into U-boat production. As {{a result of the}} growing importance of U-boat construction and a moratorium on new surface ships imposed by the Reichsmarineamt (RMA the Imperial Navy Office), the conversion project was abandoned.|$|E

On 25 May, Texas, along with battleships , , and , rescued 230 passengers from the damaged Holland America Line <b>passenger</b> <b>ship</b> , which had been rammed by Norwegian-flagged fruit steamer Joseph J. Cuneo. In gratitude, Holland America Line presented Texas with {{a model of a}} 17th-century warship, which is displayed with the wardroom silver as of 2014. In 1916, Texas became the first US battleship to mount anti-aircraft guns with the addition of two /50 caliber guns on platforms atop the boat cranes, and the first to control gunfire with directors and rangefinders, analog forerunners of today's computers.|$|E
5|$|U-47s seventh patrol {{consisted}} of her travelling {{north of the}} British Isles and into the North Atlantic, south of Iceland. During a period of 30 days, she sank {{a total of six}} enemy vessels and damaged another. U-47s first victory during her seventh patrol was the sinking of the Belgian <b>passenger</b> <b>ship</b> Ville de Mons on 2 September 1940. This was followed by the sinking of a British vessel, Titan, on 4 September and Gro, José de Larrinaga, and Neptunian on the 7th. On the 9th, U-47 sank the Greek merchant ship Possidon, and on 21 September she damaged the British merchant ship Elmbank. Following these victories, on the 25th, U-47 entered the French port of Lorient, which was now under German control following the decisive Battle of France.|$|E
5|$|When the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914 disrupted service to Belgium, Kroonland shifted to alternate routes. On {{a trip to the}} Mediterranean in October 1914, Kroonland was detained by British authorities at Gibraltar, and part of her cargo was confiscated amidst diplomatic wrangling between the then-neutral United States and the United Kingdom. During a chartered circumnavigation of South America in February 1915, Kroonland became the largest <b>passenger</b> <b>ship</b> to date to transit the Panama Canal. Kroonland was placed in New York – Panama Canal – San Francisco service until a landslide temporarily closed the canal to navigation. Returned to transatlantic service, Kroonland {{was one of the first}} U.S. ships armed by the Navy for defense against German submarine attacks. In May 1917 Kroonland was struck by a torpedo, which failed to detonate and only slightly damaged the ship.|$|E
40|$|The world {{financial}} crisis {{has resulted in}} the slowdown of Greek economy leading to the recession of certain sectors, like <b>Passenger</b> <b>Shipping.</b> Factors, such as the decrease of private consumption and GDP, have negatively influenced <b>Passenger</b> <b>Shipping,</b> resulting in the reduction not only of the relevant demand, but also of the sector's financial results. The paper examines the current situation of Greek <b>Passenger</b> <b>Shipping</b> during this "crisis" period. Financial analysis of the sector has indicated that companies face many problems; annual turnover decreases, reduced profit margins and deteriorating liquidity ratios, while the relevant financial ratios are worse than the corresponding ones of the Greek Economy on average.
