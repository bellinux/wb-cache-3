40|$|The HTML Color Codes {{exhibition}} {{features a}} selection of internet based artwork that address the topic of digital color. The central question that the exhibition poses {{is whether or not}} artists working with the internet are in fact limited to a 2 ̆ 2 ready-made 2 ̆ 2 color palette, a premise that many artists working with film, photography, and mass produced, standardized <b>paint</b> <b>sets</b> have assumed. The rationale for this question stems from theories of perception that argue that color is a not ready-made object found in a <b>paint</b> <b>set</b> or machine, but rather it is an experience that results from a complex process of light interacting with the retina and human nervous system. Dr. Susan Ballard is a writer, curator, musician and artist who spends her time writing, thinking and teaching about contemporary digital and time-based installation art, sound and noise. Her current research investigates the contribution of artists to contemporary notions of utopia and the political and cultural implications of a materialist reading of media cultures in antipodean environments...|$|R
