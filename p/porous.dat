5|$|Gaseous {{diffusion}} {{is based}} on Graham's law, which states {{that the rate of}} effusion of a gas through a <b>porous</b> barrier is inversely proportional to the square root of the gas's molecular mass. In a container with a <b>porous</b> barrier containing a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is slightly enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is slightly depleted. A container wherein the enrichment process takes place through gaseous diffusion is called a diffuser.|$|E
5|$|The corticioid {{species of}} Boidinia, Gloeopeniophorella, and Pseudoxenasma develop crust-like fruitbodies with a smooth, <b>porous,</b> or flaky surface and grow on tree logs or dead branches.|$|E
5|$|Yttria {{is used as}} a {{sintering}} additive in {{the production}} of <b>porous</b> silicon nitride. It {{is used as a}} common starting material for material science and for producing other compounds of yttrium.|$|E
5|$|In the past, {{oligonucleotide}} synthesis {{was carried}} out manually in solution or on solid phase. The solid phase synthesis was implemented using, as containers for the solid phase, miniature glass columns similar in their shape to low-pressure chromatography columns or syringes equipped with <b>porous</b> filters.|$|E
5|$|Niobium {{and some}} niobium alloys are physiologically inert and hypoallergenic. For this reason, niobium {{is used in}} {{prosthetics}} and implant devices, such as pacemakers. Niobium treated with sodium hydroxide forms a <b>porous</b> layer that aids osseointegration.|$|E
5|$|The Skopje {{valley is}} located near a seismic fault between the African and Eurasian tectonic plates and {{experiences}} regular seismic activity. This activity in {{enhanced by the}} <b>porous</b> structure of the subsoil. Large earthquakes occurred in Skopje in 518, 1505 and 1963.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} types of rock beneath the soil strongly influence the landscape; they determine the type of vegetation that will grow, and ultimately the type of animal that will inhabit the area. Limestone has fissures and is soluble in water, therefore rivers {{have been able to}} carve deep, narrow valleys. The rivers then often find routes underground, creating cave systems. Millstone Grit is insoluble but <b>porous,</b> absorbing water which seeps through the grits, until it meets the less <b>porous</b> shales beneath, creating springs where it reaches the surface. The shales are friable and easily attacked by frost and form areas that are vulnerable to landslides, as on Mam Tor.|$|E
5|$|The geology of South Florida, {{together}} with a warm, wet, subtropical climate, provides conditions well-suited for a large marshland ecosystem. Layers of <b>porous</b> and permeable limestone create water-bearing rock and soil that affect the climate, weather, and hydrology of South Florida.|$|E
25|$|<b>Porous</b> paving (or {{pervious}} paving) is {{an alternative}} to conventional impermeable pavement and allows infiltration of runoff water to the soil or to a dedicated water storage reservoir below it In reasonably flat areas such as car parks, driveways and lightly used roads, it decreases the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff and can improve water quality by removing contaminants through filtering, interception and biological treatment. <b>Porous</b> pavements can have several forms and are either monolithic or modular. Monolithic structures consist of a single continuous <b>porous</b> medium such as <b>porous</b> concrete or <b>porous</b> pavement (asphalt) while modular structures include <b>porous</b> pavers individual paving blocks that are constructed {{so that there is}} a gap in between each paver. Commercial products that are available are for example, pavements made from special asphalt or concrete containing minimal materials, concrete grid pavements, and concrete ceramic or plastic modular pavements. <b>Porous</b> pavements are usually laid on a very <b>porous</b> material (sand or gravel), underlain by a layer of geotextile material. Maintenance activities vary {{depending on the type of}} <b>porous</b> pavement. Generally, inspections and removal of sediment and debris should be undertaken. Modulate pavers can also be lifted, backwashed and replaced when blockages occurs. Generally <b>porous</b> pavement is not suited for areas with heavy traffic loads. Particulates in stormwater can clog pores in the material.|$|E
25|$|The <b>porous</b> pot {{version of}} the Daniell cell was invented by John Dancer, a Liverpool {{instrument}} maker, in 1838. It consists of a central zinc anode dipped into a <b>porous</b> earthenware pot containing a zinc sulfate solution. The <b>porous</b> pot is, in turn, immersed in a solution of copper sulfate contained in a copper can, which acts as the cell's cathode. The use of a <b>porous</b> barrier allows ions to pass through but keeps the solutions from mixing.|$|E
25|$|A water {{retention}} curve {{is the relationship}} between volumetric water content and the water potential of the <b>porous</b> medium. It is characteristic for different types of <b>porous</b> medium. Due to hysteresis, different wetting and drying curves may be distinguished.|$|E
25|$|Separators have to {{physically}} {{separate the two}} electrodes to prevent a short circuit by direct contact. It can be very thin (a few hundredths of a millimeter) and must be very <b>porous</b> to the conducting ions to minimize ESR. Furthermore, separators must be chemically inert to protect the electrolyte's stability and conductivity. Inexpensive components use open capacitor papers. More sophisticated designs use nonwoven <b>porous</b> polymeric films like polyacrylonitrile or Kapton, woven glass fibers or <b>porous</b> woven ceramic fibres.|$|E
25|$|Three {{different}} lavas {{are present}} {{in the basement of the}} reactor building: black, brown and a <b>porous</b> ceramic. They are silicate glasses with inclusions of other materials present within them. The <b>porous</b> lava is brown lava which had dropped into water thus being cooled rapidly.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of implants, classification ranging from shape (Spherical vs egg (oval) shaped), stock vs custom, <b>porous</b> vs nonporous, specific chemical make-up, and the presence of a peg or motility post. The most basic simplification can be to divide implant types into two main groups: non-integrated (non-porous) and integrated (<b>porous).</b>|$|E
25|$|Alumina-catalyzed {{cracking}} {{systems are}} still in use {{in high school and}} university laboratories in experiments concerning alkanes and alkenes. The catalyst is usually obtained by crushing pumice stones, which contain mainly aluminium oxide and silica into small, <b>porous</b> pieces. In the laboratory, aluminium oxide (or <b>porous</b> pot) must be heated.|$|E
25|$|<b>Porous</b> {{absorbers}} tend to {{be smaller}} in size and are easier to design and build as well as less expensive overall than resonant absorbers. However, the deep bass attenuation of a <b>porous</b> absorber is generally inferior, so its usefulness for attenuating lower frequency room resonances is more limited.|$|E
25|$|Covering: <b>Porous</b> fabric (similar to speaker grill cloth) {{is usually}} used.|$|E
25|$|Development in polymer {{chemistry}} {{has allowed}} introduction of newer biocompatible material such as <b>porous</b> polyethylene (PP) {{to be introduced}} into the ﬁeld of orbital implant surgery. <b>Porous</b> polyethylene enucleation implants have been used since at least 1989. It is available in dozens of prefabricated spherical and non-spherical shapes and in different sizes or plain blocks for individualized intraoperative customizing.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{practice}} is {{to investigate the}} applicability of <b>porous</b> bass trap absorbers before investigating resonant or hybridized bass trap absorbers. Complementary methods to use in combination with <b>porous</b> absorption include drywall/stud construction of walls/ceiling and filled with insulation {{as a form of}} highly damped resonant bass trapping using the drywall itself as the membrane. The combination of inherently lossy resonant room boundaries and paper or foil faced <b>porous</b> bass trap absorption deep in the tricorners (where three room boundaries meet) is often sufficient to attain acceptable bass response even in listening rooms with somewhat problematic resonances.|$|E

25|$|Siliceous sinter is <b>porous,</b> low-density, light-colored {{siliceous}} rock deposited by {{waters of}} hot springs and geysers.|$|E
25|$|For {{fluid flow}} over a <b>porous</b> boundary, the fluid {{velocity}} can be discontinuous between the free fluid and the fluid in the <b>porous</b> media (this {{is related to}} the Beavers and Joseph condition). Further, it is useful at low subsonic speeds to assume that a gas is incompressible — that is, the density of the gas does not change even though the speed and static pressure change.|$|E
25|$|Adsorption is {{the process}} of {{trapping}} atoms or molecules that are incident on a surface; therefore the adsorption capacity of a material increases with its surface area. In three dimensions, the maximum surface area will be obtained by a structure which is highly <b>porous,</b> such that atoms and molecules can access internal surfaces. This simple qualitative argument suggests that the highly <b>porous</b> metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) should be excellent candidates for hydrogen storage devices.|$|E
25|$|The main {{impregnation}} {{techniques are}} wet impregnation and dry impregnation. During wet impregnation, the <b>porous</b> particles are dissolved in the extractant {{and allowed to}} soak with the respective fluid. In this approach, the particles are either contacted with a precalculated amount of extractant, which completely soaks into the <b>porous</b> matrix, or the particles are contacted with an excess of extractant. After soaking, the remaining extractant, which is not inside the pores, is evaporated.|$|E
25|$|The <b>porous</b> {{nature of}} {{integrated}} implants allows ﬁbrovascular ingrowth throughout the implant and thus also insertion of pegs or posts.|$|E
25|$|Bacteria {{and fungi}} (myco-organisms) {{live and die}} within the <b>porous</b> media of charcoal, thus {{increasing}} its carbon content.|$|E
25|$|The Brownian motion can {{be modeled}} by a random walk. Random walks in <b>porous</b> media or fractals are anomalous.|$|E

25|$|Cloud Room or Cloud Land has a rough <b>porous</b> ceiling. The {{ceiling is}} made of {{dolomite}} and looks like low hanging clouds.|$|E
25|$|In the past, spherical nonporous {{implants}} {{were placed}} in the intraconal space and the extraocular muscles were either left unattached or were tied over the implant. Wrapping these implants allows attachment of the muscles to the covering material, a technique that seems to improve implant movement and reduce the incidence of implant migration. <b>Porous</b> implants may be saturated with antibiotic solution before insertion. Because the brittle nature of hydroxyapatite prevents direct suturing of the muscles to the implant, these implants are usually covered with some form of wrapping material. The muscles are attached to the implant in a technique similar to that used for spherical non-porous implants. The muscles may be directly sutured to <b>porous</b> polyethylene implants either by passing the suture through the implant material or by using an implant with fabricated suture tunnels. Some surgeons also wrap <b>porous</b> polyethylene implants either to facilitate muscle attachment or {{to reduce the risk of}} implant exposure. A variety of wrapping materials have been used to cover <b>porous</b> implants, including polyglactin or polyglycolic acid mesh, heterologous tissue (bovine pericardium), homologous donor tissue (sclera, dermis), and autogenous tissue (fascia lata, temporalis fascia, posterior auricular muscle, rectus abdominis sheath).|$|E
