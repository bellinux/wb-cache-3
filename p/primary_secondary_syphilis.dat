40|$|BACKGROUND. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} whether the divergence in national trends of gonorrhea and syphilis from 1986 to 1989 in the United States was real and if overall trends masked a contemporaneous increase in both diseases in a core group. METHODS. We analyzed the following: (1) reported cases of gonorrhea and <b>primary</b> and <b>secondary</b> <b>syphilis</b> in the United States for the years 1981 to 1989, (2) gonorrhea screening results from six states for the years 1985 to 1989, and (3) reported cases of gonorrhea and <b>primary</b> and <b>secondary</b> <b>syphilis</b> by census tract for the years 1986 to 1989 in one city. RESULTS. The incidence of gonorrhea decreased 22 % in the United States from 1986 to 1989 while the incidence of <b>primary</b> and <b>secondary</b> <b>syphilis</b> increased 59 %. Among Blacks, syphilis incidence increased 100 % and gonorrhea incidence decreased 13 %; among Whites and Hispanics, the incidence of both diseases decreased. Results from gonorrhea screening among females in six states agree with gonorrhea incidence trends in those areas. Race-specific and census tract analyses of data from a number of metropolitan areas where overall rates diverged did not demonstrate a group in which the incidence of both diseases increased. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that diverging trends of gonorrhea and syphilis from 1986 to 1989 are real and emphasize differences in the epidemiologic characteristics of these two sexually transmitted diseases...|$|R

40|$|The {{striking}} {{increase in}} the prevalence of concordant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and syphilis observed by clinicians and public health officers {{over the past decade}} has renewed interest in the subject. Although the effect of HIV infection on the natural history of syphilis has been known for a long time, it was not until recently that several studies documented that syphilis may also impact the course of HIV infection. Despite an improved understanding of the interaction of these 2 conditions, many controversies still exist. In this article, we focus on the most recent literature describing the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of syphilis in the context of HIV infection. The interaction between syphilis and HIV infection is complex and remains incompletely understood, despite there being 12 decades of clinical experience with coinfected patients. Since its last review in this journal [1], new data have emerged in-creasing our understanding of the interaction between HIV infection and syphilis that apply to both the heterosexual pop-ulation and {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM). EPIDEMIOLOGY After steady decreases for 11 decade, rates of syphilis in the United States reached their lowest point during 2000, when the rate of <b>primary</b> and <b>secondary</b> <b>syphilis</b> was 2. 1 cases per 100, 000 persons [2]. By 2005, the rate of <b>primary</b> and <b>secondary</b> <b>syphilis</b> increased to 3. 0 cases per 100, 000 persons, representing an in-crease from 5976 to 8724 cases, of which 86 % occurred in men. This {{increase in the}} rate ratio of male to female patients (from 1. 2 in 1996 to 5. 7 in 2005) was a reflection of the disproportionate burden of disease among MSM, who accounted for ∼ 65 % of all persons with <b>primary</b> and <b>secondary</b> <b>syphilis</b> [2]. Large cities with well-established populations of MSM have been the most affected by this shift in the epidemic. In Cali-fornia, there was a 1700 % increase in <b>primary</b> and <b>secondary</b> <b>syphilis</b> cases reported between 1999 and 2005. Among thos...|$|R

Of 1459 participants, 914 men had had sex with a man in the previous three months; the 171 MSM who reported having read the materials were significantly more likely to examine themselves (anus, adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] 1. 3, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 15 – 1. 52), mouth, penis and skin, and their partners’ anus (aPR 1. 3, 95 % CI 1. 03 – 1. 73) and mouth (aPR 1. 6, 95 % CI 1. 1 – 2. 26).

40|$|Background. Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) and Treponema pallidum coinfection is relatively common and {{accounts for about}} 25 % of <b>primary</b> and <b>secondary</b> <b>syphilis.</b> Tertiary syphilis in HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected patients is vanishingly rare. This is most likely due to early treatment of cases of <b>primary</b> and <b>secondary</b> <b>syphilis.</b> There is rapid progression to tertiary syphilis in HIV-infected patients. Case Presentation. A 49 -year-old woman diagnosed with HIV Type 1 infection and cluster of differentiation 4 (CD 4) count of 482 presented with a four-week history of multiple crusted plaques, nodules, and ulcers on her face, arms, and abdomen. Her past history revealed red painful eyes six months prior to this presentation. She had generalized lymphadenopathy, no alopecia, and no palmar-plantar or mucosal lesions. There were no features suggestive of <b>secondary</b> <b>syphilis.</b> Neurological examination was normal. Her rapid plasma reagin test was positive to a titer of 64. She was treated with Penicillin G 20 [*]mu IVI daily for 2 weeks. Conclusion. Penicillin remains the treatment of choice in syphilitic infected HIV negative and HIV-infected individuals. In neurosyphilis, the dose of Penicillin GIVI is 18 – 24 [*]mu daily for 10 – 14 days. This case report demonstrates the importance of excluding syphilis in any HIV-infected patient...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to define factors associated with the epidemic spread, elimination, and reintroduction of <b>primary</b> and <b>secondary</b> <b>syphilis</b> in King County, Washington, from 1987 through 1998. METHODS: Reports of <b>primary</b> and <b>secondary</b> <b>syphilis</b> in King County from 1987 through 1998 were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: During the epidemic spread of syphilis, only 15. 8 % of cases were imported. A total of 24. 0 % of patients reported cocaine use, and 18. 3 % of female patients reported having commercial sex. During the elimination of syphilis, significantly higher percentages of cases were imported and lower percentages of patients reported cocaine use or female commercial sex. During the reintroduction of syphilis in 1997 - 1998, 68 % of patients were men who reported sex with men; of this 68 %, 66 % were sero-positive for HIV. Most men reporting sex with men were 30 years or older and recruited many anonymous partners. CONCLUSIONS: As syphilis wanes, local control must focus on outbreaks following its reintroduction. Resurgence of syphilis among men reporting sex with men recapitulates the epidemiology of syphilis before the historical advent of AIDS, warranting immediate attention to this problem...|$|R

Untreated early syphilis during pregnancy results in perinatal death in up to 40 % of cases and, if acquired during the four years preceding pregnancy, may lead to infection of the fetus in 80 % of cases. Reports of outbreaks and increased numbers of <b>primary</b> and <b>secondary</b> <b>syphilis</b> cases among {{men who have sex}} with men have been documented and characterized by high rates of HIV co-infection and high-risk sexual behavior. In recent years, {{men who have sex with}} men have accounted for an increasing number of estimated <b>primary</b> and <b>secondary</b> <b>syphilis</b> cases in the United States and now account for 64 % of <b>primary</b> and <b>secondary</b> <b>syphilis</b> based on information available from 29 states and Washington, D. C. After decreasing from 2001 to 2004, the rate of <b>primary</b> and <b>secondary</b> <b>syphilis</b> among women increased from 0. 8 cases per 100, 000 population in 2004 to 1. 0 cases per 100, 000 population in 2006. After 14 years of decline in the United States, the rate of congenital syphilis increased 3. 7 % from 2005 to 2006 (from 8. 2 to 8. 5 cases per 100, 000 live births). Despite the majority of U. S. syphilis cases occurring among men who have sex with men, heterosexual syphilis may be an emerging problem given the recent increases among women and infants. Additionally, a substantial proportion of early syphilis cases is from correctional facilities, in which high rates of reactive serologies and disease are known to occur, particularly in areas experiencing heterosexual syphilis epidemics. Information from both case reports and STD Prevalence Monitoring Projects is important for STD prevention, treatment, planning, and evaluation activities. The use of data to inform, evaluate, and modify interventions and other activities is critical to the effort to prevent syphilis. To that end, this Syphilis Surveillance Report consists of national and state profiles that contain and describe figures and tables, which provide an overview of syphilis morbidity in the United States. These profiles present adult and congenital syphilis trends and other statistics in the United States through 2006 and are based on case reports from the 65 sexually transmitted disease (STD) project areas.

Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction {{was used to assess}} levels of coreceptor mRNA expression. Results. Women with <b>primary</b> or <b>secondary</b> <b>syphilis</b> or with HSV- 1 or HSV- 2 infection had significantly in-creased numbers of CD 14 cells expressing CCR 5 within the genital ulcer. This increase was also noted in the nonulcerated tissue isolated from women with syphilis and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from women with <b>secondary</b> <b>syphilis.</b> CCR 5 mRNA expression was increased in tissue obtained from syphilis lesions. Conclusions. Monocytes recruited to genital ulcer disease (GUD) sites express increased levels of CCR 5. This increased expression could account, at least in part, for enhanced HIV- 1 transmission in the setting of GUD. There is now compelling evidence that genital ulcer dis-ease (GUD) is a significant risk factor for the bidirec-tional transmission of HIV- 1 [1 – 8]. This epidemiologi...|$|R
