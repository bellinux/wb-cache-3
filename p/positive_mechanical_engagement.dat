40|$|The {{ability of}} cells to adhere and sense {{differences}} in tissue stiffness {{is crucial for}} organ development and function. The central mechanisms by which adherent cells detect extracellular matrix compliance, however, are still unknown. Using two single-molecule-calibrated biosensors that allow the analysis of a previously inaccessible but physiologically highly relevant force regime in cells, we demonstrate that the integrin activator talin establishes mechanical linkages following cell adhesion, which are indispensable for cells to probe tissue stiffness. Talin linkages are exposed {{to a range of}} piconewton forces and bear, on average, 7 - 10 pN during cell adhesion depending on their association with F-actin and vinculin. Disruption of talin's <b>mechanical</b> <b>engagement</b> does not impair integrin activation and initial cell adhesion but prevents focal adhesion reinforcement and thus extracellular rigidity sensing.

30|$|The {{external}} morphology of {{the dental}} implant {{is a factor}} {{which leads to the}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>engagement</b> of the implant with the bone. Three-thread-design dental implants consist of three different thread designs. The first design is the micro-thread, or supra-fine thread, which is on the coronal third of the implant fixture and is attached to the cortical bone. These small, fine threads are designed for force distribution, an increase in the bone-implant contact area and a decrease in the force concentration at the abutment-implant connection area. The second design is the reverse buttress thread, which is on the middle third of the implant fixture. This design increases the retention between the implant and spongy bone and produces resistance to compressive force. The third design, the condensed thread, is located at the apical third of the implant fixture. The thinness {{at the beginning of this}} thread and an increase in thickness along the implant fixture are designed for the soft spongy bone condensability [2].|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Three {{different}} textures {{were produced}} by Laser Surface Texturing (LST) on Al 2 O 3 /TiC ceramic surfaces. MoS 2 solid lubricants were filled into the textures.

At the texture spacing of 100 µm, 150 µm and 200 µm, wavy textured surface had the lowest friction coefficient, while it was the dimpled surface at the texture spacing of 250 µm.

Methods: We developed an autonomous battery powered exoskeleton that is capable of providing substantial levels of <b>positive</b> <b>mechanical</b> power to the ankle during the push-off region of stance phase. We measured the metabolic energy consumption of seven subjects walking on a level treadmill at 1. 5 m/s, while wearing a 23 kg vest.

Use of the autonomous leg exoskeleton significantly reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 36 [*]±[*] 12 W, which was an improvement of 8 [*]±[*] 3 % (p[*]=[*] 0. 025) relative to the control condition of not wearing the exoskeleton.

40|$|Implant {{stability}} plays {{a critical}} role for successful osseointegration. Successful osseointegration {{is a prerequisite for}} functional dental implants. Continuous monitoring in an objective and qualitative manner is important to determine the status of implant stability. Implant stability is measured at two different stages: Primary and secondary. Primary stability comes from <b>mechanical</b> <b>engagement</b> with cortical bone. Secondary stability is developed from regeneration and remodeling of the bone and tissue around the implant after insertion and affected by the primary stability, bone formation and remodelling. The time of functional loading is dependent upon the implant stability. Historically the gold standard method to evaluate stability were microscopic or histologic analysis, radiographs, however due to invasiveness of these methods and related ethical issues various other methods have been proposed like cutting torque resistance, reverse torque analysis, model analysis etc. It is, therefore, of an utmost importance to be able to access implant stability at various time points and to project a long term prognosis for successful therapy. Therefore this review focuses on the currently available methods for evaluation of implant stability...|$|R
