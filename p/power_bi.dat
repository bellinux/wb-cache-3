An examination of data on the BI and wildfires in Los Angeles County, California from January 1976 to December 2000 reveals that although the BI is positively associated with wildfire occurrence, its predictive value is quite limited. Wind speed alone has a higher correlation with burn area than BI, for instance, and a simple alternative point process model using wind speed, relative humidity, precipitation and temperature well outperforms the BI in terms of predictive <b>power.</b> The <b>BI</b> is generally far too high in Winter and too low in Fall, and may exaggerate the impact of individual variables such as wind speed or temperature during times when other variables, such as precipitation or relative humidity, render the environment ill-suited for wildfires...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} <b>power</b> - and <b>bi</b> -spectrum of vacuum {{fluctuations}} in a hyperbolic section of de Sitter space, comparing two states of physical interest: the Bunch-Davies and hyperbolic vacuum. We introduce a one -parameter family of de Sitter hyperbolic sections and their natural vacua, and identify a limit {{in which it}} reduces to the planar section and the corresponding Bunch -Davies vacuum state. Selecting the Bunch -Davies vacuum for a massless scalar field implies a mixed reduced density matrix in a hyperbolic section of de Sitter space. We stress that in the Bunch -Davies state the hyperbolic de Sitter $n$-point correlation functions have to match the planar de Sitter $n$-point correlation functions. The expressions for the planar and hyperbolic Bunch -Davies correlation functions only appear different because of the transformation from planar to hyperbolic coordinates. Initial state induced deviations from the standard inflationary predictions are instead obtained by considering the pure hyperbolic vacuum, as we verify explicitly by computing the <b>power</b> - and <b>bi</b> -spectrum. For the bi -spectrum in the hyperbolic vacuum {{we find that the}} corrections as compared to the standard Bunch -Davies result are not enhanced in specific momentum configurations and strongly suppressed for momenta large compared to the hyperbolic curvature scale. We close with some final remarks, in particular regarding the implications of these results for more realistic inflationary bubble scenarios.

40|$|Background and Purpose: The stroke patient {{population}} is heterogeneous, leading to wide variation in outcome caused by differences in age, initial severity, and presence of concomitant disease. Setting an identical recovery target for all patients in intervention trials may conceal individually important therapeutic treatment effects. Instead, a variable end point that takes severity or likely prognosis into account {{may be more}} informative. Methods: We used data from the Glycine Antagonist in Neuroprotection (GAIN) International trial to assess statistical power of various primary end points for intervention trials. We selected prognosis-adjusted cut points based on Barthel Index (BI) or Rankin Scale (RS) using a prognostic model, or assigned a fixed end point within subgroups of patients defined by their Oxford category or National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score. We simulated a treatment effect and estimated statistical power with standard formulae.

40|$|AbstractPrevious {{studies on}} food webs always neglect weight {{information}} of edges and nodes. However, as the empirical food webs collected by researchers indicate {{that not only}} topological structures, but also weight information of each edge and vertex is available, in which, edge weight is the energy flux between any two species, and vertex weight is the total biomass of a given species on the food web. We define two variables Fi and Bi for each species i representing the total energy flux through i and the total biomass of it respectively. Then we find following common patterns of these variables by investigating 20 empirical weighted food webs: (1) Fi and Bi all follow DGBD distribution (with two exponents a and b) which {{is a kind of}} deformed Zipf law; (2) A <b>power</b> law relationship <b>Bi</b> ∼ Fiτ with an exponent τ in [0. 63, 1. 75] is always held for all the empirical webs.

40|$|I. Background and motivation: Thermoelectricity {{was first}} {{observed}} in 1823 by Seebeck, {{who found that}} a current would flow in a closed circuit made of two dissimilar metals when the two junctions were maintained at different temperatures. Twelve years later, a reverse effect was discovered by Peltier, who observed temperature changes {{in the vicinity of}} the junction between dissimilar conductors when a current was passed through the junction. In 1851 W. Thomson established a relationship between the Seebeck coefficient (S) and Peltier coefficient () and predicted the existence of a third thermoelectric effect, the Thomson effect, which he subsequently observed experimentally. Since then much work has been done to make use of thermoelectric physics. Thermoelectric materials have the advantage of no mechanical parts, no need for coolant to operate, quiet performance, and can be utilized as a heat-electricity converter. Therefore, thermoelectric materials can be used either as a power generator based on the Seebeck effect, or as a thermo-cooler based on the Peltier effect. The current state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials commercially used for refrigeration and <b>power</b> generation are <b>Bi</b> 2 Te 3 with T down to about 250 K and Si 1 -xGex with T> 700 K. II.
