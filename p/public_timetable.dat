25|$|In December, 1967, the New York Central {{published}} {{its last}} <b>public</b> <b>timetable.</b> The final timetable revealed a drastically truncated passenger schedule {{in anticipation of}} its merger with the PRR. Most deluxe long-distance passenger trains ended on December 3, 1967, including the famed 20th Century Limited. Only those trains which were to be continued after the merger with the PRR were retained, along with the railroad's commuter trains.|$|E
25|$|The station {{opened to}} {{passenger}} traffic on 1 May 1885 {{with a staff}} complement of a station master, two assistant clerks, two ticket collectors, and three porters. Although it had been agreed that the station would be named Harringay Park, the GNR <b>public</b> <b>timetable</b> from May 1885 shows that station was in fact named Harringay from the outset.

2500|$|As well as freight services, tourist trains ran to Kuranda, {{although}} the tourist service {{was not a}} formal part of the <b>public</b> <b>timetable</b> of the Queensland Railways until the 1960s. The tourist potential of the second section was recognised early on, with Cairns Alderman Macnamara in September 1887 calling it a great engineering feat, which [...] "would prove a great attraction to tourists {{from all parts of}} the globe". In 1893 local representatives from the Barron Divisional Board met with the Railway Commissioners to discuss a proposed viewing stop on the line for the Barron Falls.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of the accident, normal {{northbound}} traffic through the section included two overnight sleeping car expresses from London to Edinburgh and Glasgow which were due to depart Carlisle at 5.50am and 6.05am respectively, followed by an all-stations local passenger service from Carlisle to , which was advertised in the <b>public</b> <b>timetable</b> as departing Carlisle at 6.10am but which normally departed at 6.17am. [...] If the sleepers ran late, the local service could not be held back to depart from Carlisle behind them because precedence would then need to be given to the scheduled departure of rival companies' express trains at 6.30am and 6.35am. Also, any late running of the local train would cause knock-on delays to a Moffat to Glasgow and Edinburgh commuter service with which the stopper connected at Beattock. [...] Therefore, in the event of {{one or both of the}} sleepers running late the stopping train would depart at its advertised time of 6.10am and then be shunted at one of the intermediate stations or signalboxes to allow the sleeper(s) to overtake.|$|E
