5|$|Brown {{explored}} coaching possibilities, {{but he was}} mindful not to <b>put</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> {{a position}} where his control might be challenged {{as it had been}} in Cleveland. In the mid-1960s, the American Football League (AFL), which had formed to compete against the NFL, put a new franchise in Cincinnati. Brown was the third-largest investor in the team and was given the title of coach and general manager. He was also given the right to represent the team in all league matters, a key element of control for Brown.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{returned}} to Brunswick {{after the war}} and reopened the Planters' Hoe Company in association with George T. Lane. He ended the production of augers, which still made up a small percentage of production even after closing Millville Manufacturing. Allen <b>put</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> charge of manufacturing and sales and he again secured a solid market share in the South. A prosperous trade resumed and was still strong at least until the 1880s. The company eventually expanded and began manufacturing lighter common hoes for the general public, adding to its heavy southern-style line of hoes. The Planters' Hoe Company was still a success as late as the 1890s, but it was extinct by the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns's {{political}} advisers {{break the}} news to Mr. Burns that he is greatly despised by many people while Bailey is beloved by all. To compensate for this, they force Mr. Burns to try being friendly and even smile. Mr. Burns makes a television commercial discussing Blinky with an actor portraying Charles Darwin, who claims Blinky is an evolutionary step and not a mutated fish. Combined with a promise to lower taxes and a smear campaign against Bailey, Mr. Burns ties {{with her in the}} polls. On the night before the election, Mr. Burns's advisers suggest that Mr. Burns have dinner at the home of a middle-class family as an opportunity to <b>put</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> the lead. Mr. Burns scans his employees for the most average man he can find, and Homer is chosen.|$|E

5|$|As {{the teams}} {{returned}} to Asia, the focus {{shifted to the}} championship race. Lewis Hamilton <b>put</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> the ideal position to take the fight to Fernando Alonso, qualifying on pole whilst Alonso could only manage fifth place. In the physically most demanding race of the year, the teams jostled for position through {{the first phase of}} the Grand Prix, trying to position themselves for the final ten laps. Just as the drivers established a rhythm, Hamilton's gearbox failed, forcing him out of the race and handing the lead to Sebastian Vettel. The race was shortened by two laps to fit the two-hour time limit for a Grand Prix following a pair of lengthy safety car interventions; first, Narain Karthikeyan understeered into the barriers under the grandstands on lap 30, forcing the safety car to be deployed. The drivers had little opportunity to get comfortable on the restart, as Michael Schumacher misjudged his braking point at the end of the Esplanade Bridge, careening into the back of Jean-Éric Vergne and triggering the safety car for the second time in an accident that was a near mirror-image of his collision with Sergio Pérez in 2011. He was later given a ten-place grid penalty for the Japanese Grand Prix. Vettel controlled the race from the second restart, beating Jenson Button to the line, for his second win of the season and his first since the Bahrain Grand Prix five months previously. Alonso completed the podium, retaining his championship lead after defending from Paul di Resta late in the race. Elsewhere, a string of retirements – including a late engine problem for Bruno Senna, which left the Brazilian with minor burns to his back – and a series of altercations involving Mark Webber, Nico Hülkenberg, Kamui Kobayashi and Sergio Pérez as they fought over the minor points positions allowed Timo Glock to finish twelfth, the result seeing Marussia retake tenth position in the World Constructors' Championship from Caterham.|$|E

25|$|In November 1985, Mailer {{brought his}} {{play to the}} Actors Studio, an Off Broadway theater and school that gained {{worldwide}} recognition {{under the leadership of}} Lee Strasberg.

A Hodgson penalty, Shane Williams try and Hodgson conversion took the final margin to 30–19.|$|E
25|$|The African Army of Revolution (AAR) is an {{organization}} of black African militants led by expatriate American Hiram Lusana; with the stated goal of overthrowing the minority white government of the Republic of South Africa by using international public opinion and force against military targets.

25|$|It {{is during}} the siege of Perpignan that the French barber surgeon Ambroise Paré, {{accompanying}} the French army, had {{the idea for a}} new technique.

25|$|Bertie {{was again}} {{returned}} for Westbury in the 1690 election without a contest. A Tory {{like the rest}} of his family, his role in this Parliament was overshadowed by his kinsmen, including his more active nephew and namesake, Peregrine Bertie. The disaffection of Danby, now Marquess of Carmarthen, with the other Tory peers seems to have drawn the Berties, to some extent, into opposition to the Court during this time. By 1694, however, Peregrine was writing to Lindsey to suggest that Charles might take the occasion of a by-election at Stamford to <b>put</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> better standing with the Court. In 1693, he gave up his customs surveyorship and was replaced by John Dove.|$|E
25|$|Instead of {{attempting}} to peacefully end the uprising, Daskalov, soon supported by Stamboliyski, <b>put</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> charge of the rebelling troops. On 27 September, he proclaimed that the monarchist government of Bulgaria was to be overthrown and established the so-called Radomir Republic, with Stamboliyski as its president and himself as commander-in-chief. However, the government managed to rally loyalist troops and quickly crushed the uprising. The end of the rebellion was signalled by the capture of Radomir on 2 October, only five days after Daskalov's proclamation. Severely wounded in the arm in the skirmishes, Daskalov managed to escape to Thessaloniki, Greece by surrendering to the advancing Entente forces. As Bulgaria's involvement in the war ended soon thereafter in an armistice, he was pardoned and {{allowed to return to}} the country.|$|E
25|$|Fayette Avery McKenzie's was President of Fisk University from 1915 to 1925. McKenzie's tenure {{was during}} a period of social, racial and {{political}} turbulence in American history. McKenzie <b>put</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> the line of fire during the tumultuous period before and after World War I, and demonstrated {{at a time when many}} people thought Blacks were inferior, that Blacks could attain high levels of academic achievement and compete with Whites in the nation's best colleges and universities. In spite of the pressures and social upheaval during his ten-year tenure, McKenzie developed Fisk as the premier all Black university in the United States, secured Fisk's academic recognition as a standard college by the Carnegie Foundation, Columbia University and the University of Chicago, raised a $1million endowment fund to ensure quality faculty and laid a foundation for Fisk's accreditation and future success.|$|E

25|$|The successes against {{competitors}} {{for power}} {{were due to}} Taksin's fighting ability as a warrior, splendid leadership, exemplary valor and effective organization of his forces.

Among the officials who threw in their fate with him during the campaigns for the recovery of national independence and {{for the elimination of}} the self-appointed local nobles were two personalities who subsequently played exceptionally important roles in Thai history. They were the sons of an official bearing the title of Pra Acksonsuntornsmiantra (Thai:พระอักษรสุนทรเสมียนตรา), the elder of whom named Tongduang (Thai:ทองด้วง) was born in 1737 in Ayutthaya and later to be the founder of the Chakri Dynasty, while the younger one, Boonma (Thai:บุญมา), born six years later, assumed the power second to him. The two brothers joined the royal service.|$|E
25|$|He <b>put</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> the {{spotlight}} {{once again in}} Game 1 of the 1972 World Series when the Athletics faced the Cincinnati Reds. He became {{the first player to}} hit home runs in his first two World Series at bats and drove in all three runs in the A's 3–2 victory. In Game 4, the A's were losing 2–1, with their only run to that point coming on Tenace's solo home run. A ninth-inning one-out rally consisting of four singles, with Tenace's the second and the rest coming from pinch hitters, won the game against Cincinnati's ace relief pitcher, Clay Carroll. He hit a three-run home run in the A's Game 5 loss. Before Game 6 of the 1972 Series, he was the target of a death threat. In Game 7, he was once again the hero, driving in two runs in a 3–2 victory for Oakland. In total, he went 8 for 23 in the Series, with 4 home runs and nine RBI to earn the World Series Most Valuable Player Award.|$|E
25|$|To {{compose the}} music for Broadchurch, Ólafur read the show's scripts to <b>put</b> <b>himself</b> <b>in</b> the right mood. He also {{researched}} sounds which might be heard in Dorset {{as a means of}} inspiration. As with most of his music, he then improvised at the piano. He composed several themes, some for the series as a whole and some for specific characters. He then shared them with Chibnall, and together they picked out the themes they liked best. Using synthesizers or electronic sound generators, Ólafur also composed sounds to be heard when action occurred in certain spaces, such as the cliffs. Once he saw the completed footage for the first episode, he rearranged some themes to fit the imagery, and composed several new themes as well. Because there was so little time between his being hired and the air date, Ólafur composed very quickly and spent extraordinarily long days at work. He had just four months to generate about 30 minutes of sound and music for each episode, spending one-and-a-half to two weeks on each episode. Despite the time crunch, Ólafur credited Chibnall's relaxed attitude as the key to the music's success.|$|E
