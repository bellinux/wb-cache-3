Around this device, he built what became the world's foremost laboratory for the new field of nuclear physics research in the 1930s. He received a patent for the cyclotron in 1934, which he assigned to the Research Corporation, a <b>private</b> <b>foundation</b> that funded much of Lawrence's early work.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{a number}} of <b>private</b> <b>foundations</b> and {{organizations}} have launched ambitious initiatives to support promising entrepreneurs in developing countries, on both a for-profit and not-for-profit basis. Many of these programs have focused exclusively on building business capacity. While these tailored programs {{play an important role}} in supporting small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) development, their overall effectiveness remains hamstrung in part by continuing constraints on entrepreneurs’ access to expansion and operating capital. Simultaneously, the U. S. government, other bilateral donors, and international financial institutions (IFIs) have launched a series of initiatives that provide both financial and technical assistance to SMEs in developing countries. Surprisingly, collaboration or formalized partnerships between <b>private</b> <b>foundations</b> and donor agencies has been somewhat limited—particularly on a strategic or globalized basis. This paper is targeted for these <b>private</b> <b>foundations,</b> especially those focused on women entrepreneurship. First, it provides a brief literature review of the rationale for and against SME initiatives. Second, it presents an overview of existing targeted USG and IFI programs. Lastly, it offers several new, incremental options for <b>private</b> <b>foundations</b> to establish focused partnerships with donor agencies in support of their ongoing organizational goals.

50|$|A {{foundation}} in the United States {{is a type}} of charitable organization. However, the Internal Revenue Code distinguishes between <b>private</b> <b>foundations</b> (usually funded by an individual, family, or corporation) and public charities (community foundations and other nonprofit groups that raise money from the general public). <b>Private</b> <b>foundations</b> have more restrictions and fewer tax benefits than public charities like community foundations.|$|R
40|$|Each year, <b>private</b> <b>foundations</b> {{contribute}} {{billions of}} dollars to various charitable activities. The financial assistance provided by these organizations supports programs dedicated to education, health and human services, environmental preservation, arts and culture, and many other areas. Through this assistance, <b>private</b> <b>foundations</b> make a significant contribution to the nonprofit sector. While many small foundations donate large percentages of their annual revenue to charitable giving, the major economic impact of <b>private</b> <b>foundations</b> is attributable to the relatively small number of organizations that hold the largest amounts of assets and pay out the greatest amount of charitable dollars. The largest 100 foundations alone, though they make up less than 1 percent {{of the total number of}} <b>private</b> <b>foundations,</b> generally report approximately one-third of the charitable contributions paid and the fair market value assets held by foundations.
