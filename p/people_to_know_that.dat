During an interview with Rolling Stone, Fantasia said the following about the song's message: [...] "I wanted <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I've been through the rain, I 've been broken into pieces, I had a daughter at such a young age.

500|$|On 22 August 634, Abu Bakr died, {{having made}} Umar, Khalid's cousin, his successor. Umar's first move was to relieve Khalid from supreme command of Muslim Forces and appoint Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah {{as the new}} {{commander}} in chief of the Islamic army. Khalid had become a trial of disbelief (because of his undefeated wars) for the Muslims as they had attributed the wins of battles to the personality and figure of Khalid; Umar was reported as saying:"I did not fire Khalid ibn al Waleed because I am angry with him or because of betrayal of trust or responsibility but the reason was just that I wanted <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> it is Allah who gives victory".

He spent his childhood attached to his father, who subsequently became the narrator for the Gang Busters radio program. When Norman Schwarzkopf was eight years old, his father returned to the military amid World War II. His continuous absence made home life difficult, particularly for his wife. As a 10-year-old cadet at Bordentown Military Institute, near Trenton, he posed for his official photograph wearing a stern expression because – as he said afterwards – [...] "Some day when I become a general, I want <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I’m serious."

Schwarzkopf developed a lifelong interest in Middle Eastern culture. The family moved to Geneva, Switzerland, in 1947, following a new military assignment for Herbert Schwarzkopf. The senior Schwarzkopf visited Italy, Heidelberg, Frankfurt, and Berlin, Germany during his military duties, and the younger Schwarzkopf accompanied him. By 1951 he had returned to Iran briefly {{before returning to the}} United States. Herbert Schwarzkopf died in 1958. From a young age, Norman wanted to be a military officer, following his father's example.|$|E

[...] Dark responded to the negative reviews saying, [...] "I don't deny that I did , it's just that I also like <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I don't currently and haven't in a long time."

[...] Lucy O'Brien, author of She Bop II: The Definitive History of Women in Rock, Pop and Soul, noted that hiring Dark as the video director implied that Spears was not that innocent. Time journalists Briton Hadden and Henry Robinson Luce said that Spears [...] "may be the queen of pop tartiness, but her new video, 'From the Bottom of My Broken Heart', is an entirely wholesome affair," [...] while Chris Ryan of MTV considered it [...] "a suitably soft-focus affair".

Such a scenario could lead to compromising vital company secrets. <b>People</b> want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> they are safe and protected at all times, so the burden doesn’t just fall on the farmer, but these are burdens that can fall on the shoulders of many of those around the farmer, too.|$|R

According to one estimate more than 4,050 cities were captured during these military conquests. Prior to his death in 644, Umar had ceased all military expeditions apparently to consolidate his rule in recently conquered Roman Egypt and the newly conquered Sassanid Empire (642–644). At his death in November 644, his rule extended from present day Libya in the west to the Indus river in the east and the Oxus river in the north.|$|E
50|$|Relationships missing regular contact but {{characterized}} by strong feelings of commitment and intimacy will also fail {{to satisfy the}} need.

Second, <b>people</b> need <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the bond is stable, there is mutual concern for one another, and that there will be a continuation of that attachment into the future.

In 2003 the company had a staff of 180 and was generating profits of 1.5 billion yen (about $15 million) on sales from 1000 titles a year.

Nevertheless, multiple lawsuits were filed against Norwood, all of which were ultimately settled out of court by her civil attorney.
