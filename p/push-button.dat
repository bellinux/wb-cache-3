5|$|The {{earliest}} {{reports from}} the crash site speculated that the Amana was already on fire when it struck the tops of trees because those trees, and pieces of the aircraft's left wing torn off in the impact with them, showed signs of scorching. Several eyewitnesses reported seeing flames in the sky before the aircraft struck the ground. Department of Civil Aviation investigators discounted this speculation because {{only one of the}} Amana's <b>push-button</b> engine fire extinguishers had activated and this had most likely occurred during the crash or the fire.|$|E
25|$|Locking, <b>push-button</b> {{glove box}} wrapped in leather.|$|E
50|$|An {{electronic}} timer allow simple <b>push-buttons</b> to be used.

The GS sedans also {{were the first}} to feature the latest generation of Lexus' SmartAccess keyless system–-adding a <b>push-button</b> start {{for the first time as}} standard.|$|E
50|$|<b>Push-buttons</b> {{can be used}} {{but must}} be {{spring-loaded}} sufficiently {{to compensate for the}} external pressure. This is usually done by using a small diameter pushrod with O-ring seals, and a moderate strength spring. On the outside a broad mushroom head is used for comfort.|$|R
50|$|Subway (1994): Mori {{stood in}} a Tokyo subway car dressed as if she just landed from outer space. She {{was dressed in a}} silver {{metallic}} costume with a headset, microphone, and <b>push-buttons</b> on her forearm. This transformation—along with Play With Me—was to explore different constructed identities.|$|R
5000|$|The use of {{the term}} [...] "machine" [...] dates from early designs that used an {{electrical}} generator operated by winding a rotary handle or pushing down a T-handle. Modern blasting machines are battery-powered and operated by key switches and <b>push-buttons,</b> and do not resemble the older designs.|$|R
25|$|In November they {{demonstrated}} the RP-3, which used welded steel tubing {{in place of}} glue-and-screwed balsa wood for the framework, and added the new feature of a parachute that could be activated when the flight was over, making landings a simple <b>push-button</b> task. Continued testing was carried out at March Field, east of Los Angeles. These early tests were not very successful, {{but a series of}} improvements were quickly worked into the design. However, at this point the Whittier estate withdrew further funding.|$|E
25|$|All second-generation IS models {{offered a}} more typical Lexus {{interior}} {{compared to the}} previous generation {{with a focus on}} luxurious accouterments.

Options ranged from touchscreen navigation with backup camera to a Mark Levinson premium sound system and Dynamic Radar Cruise Control.|$|E
25|$|This is {{an older}} method of water-saving {{automatic}} flushing, which only operates when the room has been used. A <b>push-button</b> switch is {{mounted in the}} door frame of the restroom, and triggers the flush valve for all restroom urinals every time the door is opened. While it cannot detect the use of individual urinals, it provides reasonable flushing action without wasting excessive amounts of water when the restroom is not being used. This method requires a spring-operated automatic door closer, since the flush mechanism only operates when the restroom door opens.|$|E
50|$|A former {{agent of}} EMS in the United States, Ionic Industries in Morristown, New Jersey, {{released}} a portable-keyboard VCS 3 clone. The Ionic Performer, released in 1973, had circuitry {{based on that}} of the VCS 3's. It replaced the patch board matrix with over a hundred <b>push-buttons,</b> and added built-in keyboard and effects units.|$|R
50|$|The {{automatic}} transmission with its 6 speeds is operated smoothly and conveniently with <b>push-buttons</b> {{on the instrument}} panel. The {{automatic transmission}} is easy on the truck since the engine always operates within its optimum rev. range. This also results in fuel savings. Thanks to a hydraulic torque converter, the transmission provides considerable pulling power when starting off.|$|R
50|$|User-actuated potentiometers {{are widely}} used as user controls, and may control a very wide variety of {{equipment}} functions. The widespread use of potentiometers in consumer electronics declined in the 1990s, with rotary encoders, up/down <b>push-buttons,</b> and other digital controls now more common. However they remain in many applications, such as volume controls and as position sensors.|$|R
25|$|A {{deal between}} TVNZ and Sky to have TVNZ 6 and 7 {{available}} to Sky subscribers {{in exchange for}} Prime finally being launched on Freeview with a virtual channel assignment of 10 on 17 August 2009. If Prime would have joined at launch then {{they may have been}} able to get a lower assignment, however virtual channel assignments are only enforced on certified receivers. It is also noted virtual channel 10 is not far off its usual tuning to <b>push-button</b> 9 on analogue television sets, due to its historic links with the Nine Network, its allocation on Sky's former analogue terrestrial service, and for compatibility with video recorders using the G-Code scheduling system.|$|E
25|$|Inside, {{headrests}} {{were now}} standard equipment {{and a new}} instrument panel included square instruments replacing the round instruments of previous years along with a <b>push-button</b> operated ashtray and rotary glove compartment knob, as well as heating/air conditioning controls relocated {{from the center of}} the dash to the left of the steering wheel near the lights and wiper switches. The high-beam lights indicator was a red rocket located on the dash. Also new was a steering column-mounted ignition switch that also locked the steering wheel when not in use – a feature found on all 1969-model General Motors passenger cars, a year before locking steering columns were required by federal mandate starting in 1970.|$|E
25|$|The 2 CV 4 × 4 2CV Sahara {{appeared}} in December 1960. This had an additional engine-transmission {{unit in the}} rear, mounted {{the other way around}} and driving the rear wheels. For the second engine there was a separate <b>push-button</b> starter and choke. With a gear stick between the front seats, both transmissions were operated simultaneously. For the two engines, there were separate petrol tanks under the front seats. The filler neck sat in the front doors. Both engines (and hence axles) could be operated independently. The spare wheel was mounted on the bonnet. The car had ample off-road capability, but at twice the price of the standard 2CV. 694 were produced until 1968 and one more in 1971. Many were used by the Swiss Post as a delivery vehicle. Today they are highly collectable.|$|E
50|$|The {{microcontroller}} communicates {{with its}} environment usign two serial ports. The first serial port {{is connected to}} the MIDI interface. The second serial port {{is connected to the}} front panel circuit board. The front panel has its own microcontroller, used to control the LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) and the various <b>push-buttons,</b> knobs and potentiometers on the front panel.|$|R
5000|$|M Manual {{exposure}} mode. Exposure is set by {{the user}} indicating the aperture value via the aperture dial and the shutter speed via <b>push-buttons</b> on the camera top plate. Half-pressing the shutter release will set the shutter speed value to the correct value as calculated by the camera's metering system, which the user can then vary.|$|R
50|$|These rides are {{a hybrid}} of kiddie ride and arcade video games. The rides usually {{incorporate}} a video display and, while the motion is synchronized to the events happening on the screen, the ride will start and end following the events on the screen. The ride is usually interactive and there are <b>push-buttons</b> to allow the rider {{to interact with the}} on-screen actions.|$|R
