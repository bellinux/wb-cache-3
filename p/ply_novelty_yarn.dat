50|$|Flammé yarns are {{a kind of}} <b>novelty</b> <b>yarn.</b> It is {{generally}} a loose or untwisted core wrapped by at least one other strand. The extra element can be a metallic thread, or a much-thicker or much-narrower strand of yarn, or yarn that varies between thick and thin. Some companies have come to put twin yarns on the market to show off combinations of one regular <b>yarn</b> and <b>novelty</b> <b>yarns</b> in assorted colors or even two different types of <b>novelty</b> <b>yarns.</b>|$|R

50|$|Ladder yarn or {{train tracks}} yarn {{is a type}} of <b>novelty</b> <b>yarn.</b> It is {{constructed}} like ladders, with a horizontal stripe of material suspended between two thinner threads, alternating with gaps. Sometimes a contrasting strand is fed through the gaps to produce another look.|$|R
5000|$|The yarn {{affects the}} bulk and drape of the knitted fabric, {{as well as}} the {{visibility}} of stitches. Complicated stitch patterns are best seen with a smooth, highly spun yarn and may be invisible with [...] "furry" [...] yarns such as mohair or <b>novelty</b> <b>yarns.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{fabrics and}} yarns used in {{traditional}} embroidery vary {{from place to}} place. Wool, linen, and silk have been in use {{for thousands of years}} for both fabric and yarn. Today, embroidery thread is manufactured in cotton, rayon, and <b>novelty</b> <b>yarns</b> as well as in traditional wool, linen, and silk. Ribbon embroidery uses narrow ribbon in silk or silk/organza blend ribbon, most commonly to create floral motifs.|$|R
50|$|Ribbon or tape yarn {{is a kind}} of <b>novelty</b> <b>yarn.</b> It is made of ribbon, but {{generally}} not the kind of ribbon used in sewing and millinery. Rather, they are ribbons made especially for knitting or crocheting, with some in a tubular form, some woven flat, and some similar in appearance to Bias tape. Ribbon yarns can be composed of many materials, from synthetics to silk to plant fibers.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>novelty</b> <b>yarns</b> {{make use}} of special plying {{techniques}} to gain their special effects. By varying {{the tension in the}} strands, or the relative sizes of the strands, or many other factors different effects can be achieved. For example, when a soft, thick strand is plied against a tightly twisted thin strand, the resulting yarn spirals. Another example is bouclé, which is a yarn where one strand is held loosely and allowed to make loops on the other yarn while plying.|$|R
50|$|Natural fibers from animals, such as alpaca, angora and merino {{and plant}} fibers, chiefly cotton, have become easier and less costly {{to collect and}} process and {{therefore}} more widely available. Exotic fibers, such as silk, bamboo, yak and qiviut are growing in popularity as well. The yarn industry has started to make <b>novelty</b> <b>yarns,</b> which produce stunning results without years of knitting experience. Designers have begun to create patterns which work up quickly on large needles, a phenomenon known as instant-gratification knitting.|$|R
50|$|<b>Novelty</b> <b>yarns</b> {{include a}} wide variety of yarns made with unusual features, {{structure}} or fiber composition such as slubs, inclusions, metallic or synthetic fibers, laddering and varying thickness introduced during production. Some linens, wools to be woven into tweed, and the uneven filaments of some types of silk are allowed to retain their normal irregularities, producing the characteristic uneven surface of the finished fabric. Man-made fibres, which can be modified during production, are especially adaptable for special effects such as crimping and texturizing.|$|R
5000|$|Eyelash yarn is {{made from}} a {{polyester}} fiber with a furry texture resembling eyelashes. These <b>novelty</b> <b>yarns</b> are made of a thin central ply surrounded by short [...] "hairs". This yarn differs from [...] "fur" [...] type yarn in that it contains evenly spaced threads at intervals between lengths of bare core thread, whereas fur yarns have an abundance of threads covering {{the entirety of the}} core thread. Eyelash yarn comes {{in a wide range of}} colors, with the [...] "hairs" [...] sometimes being made of multicolored or metallic fibers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Novelty</b> <b>yarns</b> are {{sometimes}} referred to as complex yarns. A yarn which makes a fabric is not always smooth and uniform. Complex yarns are the uneven yarns which may be thick and thin or have curls, loops, twists and even differently coloured areas along their length. This look of the yarns are used to add interesting effects in fabrics. In complex ply two or more complex yarns are twisted around each other to form loops, curls and knots to create fancy effects. Many knitting yarns are complex ply yarns which give interesting textures in finished products.|$|R
5000|$|Eyelash yarn {{is a type}} of <b>novelty</b> <b>yarn.</b> It {{appears as}} a thread base, with several long strands spaced at even {{intervals}} that jut out at an angle from the main strand. The long strands, or hair, can be metallic, opalescent, matte, or a combination of types. The hair can be curly or straight and can sometimes be two different lengths. Prominent types are composed of 100% polyester with a straight and relatively short hair. Because of its thinness, eyelash is normally carried along with another, plainer yarn to add visual interest to the primary yarn.|$|R
30|$|Sage AI (UK) own {{manufacturing}} plants in Poland (weave) and Egypt (knit). The creative or technical designers visit the manufacturers monthly to maintain communication and address any design/production issues. Costs limit fibre choice usually to polyester {{which is then}} designed for variety of looks, e.g. highly lustrous, soft matt, textured and <b>novelty</b> <b>yarns</b> to create interest in the woven and knitted fabrics. Wool can be used but is expensive, therefore limited (Sage used wool for the BMWi 3). Yarns are supplied by Autofil Worldwide Ltd., who also piece- or yarn-dye and texturize to a very wide variety of looks and feel; the blend, has to be visually appealing to the customer (the OEM), pass various rigorous tests (such as abrasion and light fastness), be durable (up to 10  years) and most importantly, cost effective.|$|R
5000|$|Raschel knits do not stretch {{significantly}} {{and are often}} bulky; consequently, they are often used as an unlined material for coats, jackets, straight skirts and dresses. These fabrics can be made out of conventional or <b>novelty</b> <b>yarns</b> which allows for interesting textures and designs to be created. [...] The qualities of these fabrics range from [...] "dense and compact to open and lofty and can be either stable or stretchy, and single-faced or reversible. [...] The largest outlet for the Raschel warp knitting machine is for lace fabric and trimmings. Raschel knitting is also used in outdoors and military fabrics for products such as backpacks. It is used to provide a ventilated mesh next to the user's body (covering padding) or mesh pockets and pouches to facilitate visibility of the contents (MIL-C-8061).|$|R

40|$|It is {{actually}} for history of textile technologies and Lithuanian culture heritage to investigate deeply peculiarities of manufacturing and appearance of folk textile, to establish {{local and global}} tendencies of their distribution. This investigation seeks to discover alternation of home weaving traditions establishing raw material of yarns, types of yarn structure and features of threads colours in authentic folk fabrics used in Lithuanian villages in the 19 th century in peasants clothing and showing yarns types territorial distribution in Lithuanian regions Žemaitija and Aukštaitija. It was investigated 468 pieces of clothing of this period from the album saved in National M. K. Čiurlionis Museum of Art. It is unexpected that cotton yarns are very common in warp of hand made clothing fabrics {{at the end of}} the 19 th century. Cotton yarns replaced flax and wool in warp. It was established that plied yarns dominate in warp and plain yarns – in weft. Fancy dyed, mouline, melange and yarns with multiplex winding were identificated in the fabrics. Also it was innovative to found the metallic thread in weft of two examples of the fabrics. Frequency of colours distribution was established analyzing colours of yarns. The analysis of territorial distribution of fancy yarns types showed the tendency to spread the <b>novelties</b> of <b>yarns</b> and threads in traditional textile from the West part of the country.

40|$|The <b>novelty</b> of <b>yarn</b> {{production}} from cotton/paper mulberry fiber blends was reported. The {{objective of this}} research was to prepare the paper mulberry fibers and study the possibility of production of yarns from cotton/paper mulberry fibers. For preparation of paper mulberry fibers, the inner bark was first immersed in water for 24 [*]h. Then, the fibers were treated with sodium hydroxide at concentration of 5 – 10 %[*](w/v) for 1 – 3 [*]h. After that, the bleaching process was conducted with hydrogen peroxide at concentration of 5 – 25 %[*](v/v) for different temperature and time. Finally, the fibers were washed with 10 %[*](v/v) of nonionic surfactant at temperature of 90 °C for 30 minute to remove the residual gum from the fibers. The results showed that optimum condition for scouring of the paper mulberry fibers was 15 %[*](w/v) sodium hydroxide at 90 °C for 2 [*]h. The bleaching process with 15 %[*](v/v) H 2 O 2 at 90 °C for 90 minute was suitable. The obtained fibers were blended with the cotton fibers to produce yarns by open-end spinning method. The % elongation and tenacity of the blended yarns increased with the increasing of the paper mulberry ratio. Also, the antifungal property of yarns was improved by the blending of cotton fibers with the paper mulberry fibers...|$|R
40|$|DE 10301646 A UPAB: 20040901 <b>NOVELTY</b> - Fiber <b>yarns</b> or rovings (2) {{are laid}} {{down so that}} they cross each other in layers (6 a, 6 b) and are then fixed to each other to form a stable roving preform (1). At {{least some of the}} rovings are laid down as {{individual}} sections (4) cut from a continuous roving length and are tension-free. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - All yarns or fiber rovings (2) of the preform (1) are formed as sections (4) cut from a semi-continuous yarn or fiber roving. Each layer (6 a, 6 b) comprises rows (5 a, 5 b) of individual roving sections adjacent to each other with same orientation, the sections being either parallel to or at a slight angle to each other. The rows are formed across the entire breadth of each layer. Adjacent roving rows may overlap each other. Individual roving sections are laid down at an angle to the longitudinal direction (L) of the roving preform (1). Roving sections of one or more rows of rovings may be placed simultaneously. During placement rovings are converted from a round cross-section to a flat rectangular cross-section (7). The cross-section change may be produced either before, during or after cutting of roving sections or after placing the latter. Following placement the roving sections of a layer are temporarily held in position by pairs of rolls. Roving sections may be sewn, woven or bonded together. Roving sections are laid down on a base material (9) or previous roving layer which is moved in the longitudinal direction of the preform. Roving sections in the uppermost and lowest layers are attached to carrier layers forming either a base material and/or a cover material. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for: (1) a fiber yarn or roving preform produced by the claimed process; and (2) a fiber reinforced product in which the claimed preform is completely impregnated in a plastic or resin matrix. USE - For production of a fiber roving or yarn based preform for subsequent use in production of resin or plastic impregnated composite products, in particular three-dimensional thin walled products. ADVANTAGE - The dry preform, free of fiber tension, is easily formed into three-dimensional shapes and the innermost fibers are more easily impregnated to give high strength products...|$|R
