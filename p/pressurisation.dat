5|$|Comet 1XB: Four Comet 1As were {{upgraded}} to a 1XB standard with a reinforced fuselage structure and oval windows. Both 1X series were limited {{in number of}} <b>pressurisation</b> cycles.|$|E
5|$|Diverse {{geographic}} destinations and cabin <b>pressurisation</b> alike on the Comet {{demanded the}} use of a high proportion of alloys, plastics, and other materials new to civil aviation across the aircraft in order to meet certification requirements. The Comet's high cabin pressure and fast operating speeds were unprecedented in commercial aviation, making its fuselage design an experimental process. At its introduction, Comet airframes would be subjected to an intense, high-speed operating schedule which included simultaneous extreme heat from desert airfields and frosty cold from the kerosene-filled fuel tanks, still cold from cruising at high altitude.|$|E
5|$|Aeronautical {{engineering}} {{firms were}} quick {{to respond to the}} Comet's commercial advantages and technical flaws alike; other aircraft manufacturers learned from, and profited by, the hard-earned lessons embodied by de Havilland's Comet. While the Comet's buried engines were used on some other early jet airliners, such as the Tupolev Tu-104, later aircraft, such as the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8, would differ by employing podded engines held on pylons beneath the wings. Boeing stated that podded engines were selected for their passenger airliners because buried engines carried a higher risk of catastrophic wing failure in the event of engine fire. In response to the Comet tragedies, manufacturers also developed various means of <b>pressurisation</b> testing, often {{going so far as to}} explore rapid depressurisation; subsequent fuselage skins were of a greater thickness than the skin of the Comet.|$|E
5|$|The Comet {{is widely}} {{regarded}} both as an adventurous step forward and a supreme tragedy; nevertheless, the aircraft's legacy does include numerous advances in aircraft design and in accident investigations. The inquiries into the accidents that plagued the Comet 1 were {{perhaps some of the}} most extensive and revolutionary that have ever taken place, establishing precedents in accident investigation; many of the deep-sea salvage and aircraft reconstruction techniques employed have remained in use within the aviation industry. In spite of the Comet being subjected to what was then the most rigorous testing of any contemporary airliner, <b>pressurisation</b> and the dynamic stresses involved were not thoroughly understood {{at the time of the}} aircraft's development, nor was the concept of metal fatigue. While these lessons could be implemented on the drawing board for future aircraft, corrections could only be retroactively applied to the Comet.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} experimental work related to decompression {{was conducted by}} Robert Boyle, who subjected experimental animals to reduced ambient pressure by use of a primitive vacuum pump. In the earliest experiments the subjects died from asphyxiation, but in later experiments, signs of what was later to become known as decompression sickness were observed. Later, when technological advances allowed the use of <b>pressurisation</b> of mines and caissons to exclude water ingress, miners were observed to present symptoms of what would become known as caisson disease, the bends, and decompression sickness. Once it was recognized that the symptoms were caused by gas bubbles, and that recompression could relieve the symptoms, further work showed {{that it was possible}} to avoid symptoms by slow decompression, and subsequently various theoretical models have been derived to predict low-risk decompression profiles and treatment of decompression sickness.|$|E
5|$|Four Black Arrows were {{launched}} between 1969 and 1971. The first two launches were demonstration flights, with battleship third stages and a boilerplate payload. On {{the first flight}} an electrical fault caused a pair of first stage combustion chambers to pivot back and forth. Before it cleared the launch pad, the rocket was rolling erratically, and about a minute later it began to disintegrate. After the first stage engine failed, and the rocket began to fall back to earth, it was destroyed by range safety. The second launch was successful. The first all-up launch on 2 September 1970 was the third launch of the Black Arrow, and Britain's first attempt to launch a satellite. The launch failed due to a leak in the second stage oxidiser <b>pressurisation</b> system, which caused it to cut out early. The third stage fired, but the rocket did not reach orbit, and re-entered over the Gulf of Carpentaria. The fourth launch successfully orbited the Prospero satellite, making the United Kingdom the sixth nation to place a satellite into orbit {{by means of an}} indigenously developed carrier rocket. The satellite, also known as X-3, was named Prospero after the character Prospero in Shakespeare's The Tempest. The name was chosen as a reference to events in the play, in which Prospero, a sorcerer, gives up his powers. Prior to the cancellation of the Black Arrow programme, the satellite was to be named after Puck from A Midsummer Night's Dream.|$|E
25|$|A newly {{overhauled}} cabin <b>pressurisation</b> blower {{was installed}} on number 2 engine in April 1966.|$|E
25|$|Rockwell 681 Hawk Commander: 680W with {{improved}} <b>pressurisation,</b> {{air conditioning system}} and nose, 43 built.|$|E
25|$|Based on the B90 {{but using}} the Model 100 cabin {{environment}} and <b>pressurisation</b> system, 550shp PT6A-21 engines, 507 built.|$|E
25|$|The {{third of}} the {{pre-production}} Tudor 2s, initially G-AGRZ, was used for <b>pressurisation</b> tests as VZ366 by the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough Airport, in Hampshire.|$|E
25|$|At {{increased}} ambient pressures due to depth or habitat <b>pressurisation,</b> a diver's lungs {{are filled}} with breathing gas at the increased pressure, and the partial pressures of the constituent gases will be increased proportionately.|$|E
25|$|Improved C90-1 {{improved}} {{landing gear}} retraction, improved electrical system and using F90-1 <b>pressurisation</b> and heating system, 235 built between 1984 and 1992. Two Pratt & Whitney PT6A-21 reverse-flow, free-turbine turboprop engines; 550 shp each.|$|E
25|$|Research flights continued, {{but there}} were no further {{attempts}} to break records. According to the British aerospace company BAE Systems, the test flights had resulted in invaluable flight data being obtained, particularly in the field of <b>pressurisation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was not written off, but was instead returned to Airbus {{by way of}} a low altitude flight without <b>pressurisation</b> routed from Melbourne to Toulouse on 19 June via Perth, Singapore, Dubai and Cairo with the crew flying below 12,000 feet.|$|E
25|$|The ISS has a {{large number}} of {{external}} components that do not require <b>pressurisation.</b> The largest of these is the Integrated Truss Structure (ITS), to which the station's main solar arrays and thermal radiators are mounted. The ITS consists of ten separate segments forming a structure 108.5m (356ft) long.|$|E
25|$|The Viscount {{was well}} {{received}} by the public for its cabin conditions, which included <b>pressurisation,</b> reductions in vibration and noise, and panoramic windows. It {{became one of the}} most successful and profitable of the first post-war transport aircraft; 445 Viscounts were built for a range of international customers, including in North America.|$|E
25|$|AUSROC II was {{a larger}} {{pressure}} fed kerosene-oxygen bipropellant rocket {{that was developed}} in the 1990s. It was designed to reach an altitude of 10km. The first attempt at launching an AUSROC II suffered a spectacular failure on the launch pad in 1992. The subsequent rocket, named AUSROC II-2 was successfully launched in 1995 from Woomera, although it did not reach its target apogee due to <b>pressurisation</b> problems with the LOX tank.|$|E
25|$|Reacting to the explosion, {{flight attendants}} moved {{passengers}} {{to the rear}} of the aircraft. The pilots alerted Mogadishu tower, reporting a <b>pressurisation</b> problem, but did not declare an emergency. The aircraft returned to Aden Adde International Airport and performed an emergency landing. Two injuries were reported, and the burnt body of the suicide bomber fell from the aircraft, landing in the town of Dhiiqaaley near Balad, Somalia; it was found by nearby residents.|$|E
25|$|The {{first five}} units were fitted with carbody <b>pressurisation,</b> as fitted {{to many other}} Australian National {{locomotives}} for operation in the dusty outback areas they operated in. Differences in the subsequent units included the fitting of double blade windscreen wipers, lowering of the multiple-unit jumper receptacle, and {{the changing of the}} marker light orientation from vertical to horizontal. Recent years have seen many of the class fitted with on line refuelling, and working from Melbourne to Perth on the SCT Logistics service.|$|E
25|$|The Folland Gnat is a {{purpose-built}} light fighter aircraft, suitable both as {{a trainer}} and combat aircraft, capable of being used in ground attacks and as a day fighter in the latter capacity. According to Folland, the Gnat possessed significant benefits over conventional fighter aircraft, specifically in terms of cost, man-hours, handling, serviceability, and portability. The cockpit was furnished {{with many of the}} features expected of standard fighter aircraft, full <b>pressurisation</b> and climate control systems were installed along with a Martin-Baker-built ejection seat. A conventional undercarriage is used, which is capable of operating from austere grass airstrips due to the aircraft's low weight.|$|E
25|$|The {{cockpit of}} the Lightning was {{designed}} to meet the RAF's OR946 specification for tactical air navigation technology, and thus featured an integrated flight instrument display arrangement, an Elliott Bros (London) Ltd auto-pilot, a master reference gyroscopic reader, an auto-attack system, and an instrument landing system. Despite initial scepticism of the aircraft's centralised detection and warning system, the system proved its merits during the development program and was subsequently redeveloped for greater reliability. Communications included UHF and VHF radios and a datalink. Unlike the previous generation of aircraft which used gaseous oxygen for lifesupport, the Lightning would employ liquid oxygen-based apparatus for the pilot; cockpit <b>pressurisation</b> and conditioning would be maintained through tappings from the engine compressors.|$|E
25|$|Several eruptions have seriously {{endangered}} aircraft {{which have}} encountered the eruption column. In two separate incidents in 1982, airliners {{flew into the}} upper reaches of an eruption column generated by Mount Galunggung, and the ash severely damaged both aircraft. Particular hazards were the ingestion of ash stopping the engines, the sandblasting of the cockpit windows rendering them largely opaque and the contamination of fuel through the ingestion of ash through <b>pressurisation</b> ducts. The damage to engines is a particular problem since temperatures inside a gas turbine are sufficiently high that volcanic ash is melted in the combustion chamber, and forms a glass coating on components further downstream of it, for example on turbine blades.|$|E

25|$|A {{policy change}} {{resulted}} in the pressurised PR variant of the Mk VII being renamed PR Mk X (type 387). This version followed the PR Mk XI into production and {{was based on the}} Mk VII airframe with PR Mk XI wings and camera installation. It had the pressurised Mk VII cockpit, with the Lobelle sliding canopy, and retained the fighter style windscreen with the bullet-proof glass panel. The long thin air intake to the cockpit <b>pressurisation</b> system was fitted under the exhaust stacks on the starboard cowling. The performance was {{similar to that of the}} PR XI although the pressurised cockpit meant that this version could stay at altitudes of over 40,000ft for longer without the exhausting physiological effects experienced by the pilots of unpressurised cockpits. Sixteen Mk Xs were built during April and May 1944, with the first mission being flown on 11 May. All saw limited service in 541 and 542 Squadrons in a high altitude reconnaissance role. Experience with this version led to the development and production of the pressurised version of the PR Mk XIX.|$|E
25|$|At {{atmospheric}} pressure the body tissues are therefore normally saturated with nitrogen at 0.758bar (569mmHg). At increased ambient pressures due to depth or habitat <b>pressurisation,</b> a diver's lungs {{are filled with}} breathing gas at the increased pressure, and the partial pressures of the constituent gases will be increased proportionately. The inert gases from the breathing gas in the lungs diffuse into blood in the alveolar capillaries and are distributed around the body by the systemic circulation in the process known as perfusion. Dissolved materials are transported in the blood much faster {{than they would be}} distributed by diffusion alone. From the systemic capillaries the dissolved gases diffuse through the cell membranes and into the tissues, where it may eventually reach equilibrium. The greater the blood supply to a tissue, the faster it will reach equilibrium with gas at the new partial pressure. This equilibrium is called saturation. Ingassing appears to follow a simple inverse exponential equation. The time it takes for a tissue to take up or release 50% of the difference in dissolved gas capacity at a changed partial pressure is called the half-time for that tissue and gas.|$|E
500|$|Airliner cabins {{were usually}} {{maintained}} at a pressure equivalent to 6,000–8,000feet (1,800–2,400m) elevation. Concorde's <b>pressurisation</b> {{was set to}} an altitude {{at the lower end}} of this range, [...] Concorde's maximum cruising altitude was subsonic airliners typically cruise below [...]|$|E
500|$|The ball is spherical with a {{circumference}} of between , a {{weight in the}} range of , and a pressure between [...] at sea level. In the past the ball was made up of leather panels sewn together, with a latex bladder for <b>pressurisation</b> but modern balls {{at all levels of the}} game are now synthetic.|$|E
500|$|According to de Havilland's chief {{test pilot}} John Cunningham, who had flown the prototype's first flight, representatives from American {{manufacturers}} such as Boeing and Douglas privately disclosed that if de Havilland had not experienced the Comet's <b>pressurisation</b> problems first, {{it would have}} happened to them. Cunningham likened the Comet to the later Concorde, and added that he had assumed that the aircraft would change aviation, which it subsequently did. Aviation author Bill Withuhn concluded that the Comet had pushed [...] "'the state-of-the-art' beyond its limits." ...|$|E
500|$|The Hercules {{represented}} a huge {{improvement over the}} C-47 in payload, range, speed and manoeuvrability, as well as offering cabin <b>pressurisation,</b> short-takeoff-and-landing capability, and bulk loading and despatch via its rear cargo door. The Government expressed concern over the price, at one stage proposing the purchase of only three aircraft, but eventually the Air Force won approval for the twelve that it wanted. Described by the official history of the post-war RAAF as {{second only to the}} General Dynamics F-111C as the [...] "most significant" [...] acquisition by the Air Force, the Hercules gave the Australian military its first strategic airlift capability, which in years to come would provide a [...] "lifeline" [...] for deployments to Malaya, Vietnam, and other parts of Southeast Asia. Australia was the first country other than the United States to operate the Hercules. The RAAF's C-130As were also the last of this variant to be built.|$|E
500|$|The RAE also reconstructed {{about two-thirds}} of G-ALYP at Farnborough and found fatigue crack growth from a rivet hole at the {{low-drag}} fibreglass forward aperture around the Automatic Direction Finder, which had caused a catastrophic break-up of the aircraft in high-altitude flight. [...] The punch rivet construction technique employed in the Comet's design had exacerbated its structural fatigue problems; the aircraft's windows had been engineered to be glued and riveted, but had been punch riveted only. Unlike drill riveting, the imperfect nature of the hole created by punch riveting could cause fatigue cracks to start developing around the rivet. Principal investigator Hall accepted the RAE's conclusion of design and construction flaws as the likely explanation for G-ALYU's structural failure after 3,060 <b>pressurisation</b> cycles. The Cohen inquiry closed on 24 November 1954, and although the inquiry had [...] "found that the basic design of the Comet was sound", de Havilland nonetheless began a refit programme to strengthen the fuselage and wing structure, employing thicker gauge skin and replacing all square windows and panels with rounded versions.|$|E

2500|$|The {{investigation}} {{discovered that}} a couple of years earlier, fires had occurred in one of the cabin <b>pressurisation</b> blowers on a Vickers Viscount in Canada and another in the British West Indies. [...] Both fires broke out after loosening of the nuts securing the oil metering unit to the blower. [...] Both occurred during testing of the engine on the ground. [...] At the time, the blower manufacturer was not advised. [...] It was not until the crash of Flight 149 in Australia that the blower manufacturer became aware of the need for these cabin <b>pressurisation</b> blowers to be modified.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{design in}} June 1945 {{was based on}} the Viking with four {{turboprop}} engines and 24 seats and designated the VC-2 or Type 453. Later a double-bubble fuselage was proposed to give extra underfloor cargo space. Neither was pressurised but it was soon realised that for economical operation an altitude above [...] was needed. Thus <b>pressurisation</b> was required. The decision for <b>pressurisation</b> resulted in the double-bubble and elliptical fuselage designs being abandoned. A circular cross-section variant was offered at the beginning of 1946. The resulting 28-seat VC-2 was financed by the Ministry of Supply with an order for two prototypes. But, before the contract was signed, the government asked for the capacity to be increased to 32. This stretched the fuselage increase from [...] to [...] and meant an increased wingspan of [...]|$|E
