HiPCO process helps in producing high purity single walled carbon nanotubes in higher quantity. NoPo HiPCO reactor operates at higher temperature ~1000°C under high pressure ~20-100 bar. It uses carbon monoxide as the carbon source and Nickel/ iron penta carbonyl as catalyst. These catalyst acts as the nucleation site for the nanotubes to grow.|$|E

40|$|Tata Steel IJmuiden (TSIJ) is {{responsible}} for almost 0. 7 % (8. 7 PJ) of the total Dutch natural gas use. There {{is an opportunity to}} reduce this amount by replacing natural <b>gas</b> with <b>process</b> <b>gasses</b> that are generated during the steelmaking process. The techno-economic potential of natural gas displacement through the use of <b>process</b> <b>gas</b> is investigated. After estimating future supply and demand of both natural <b>gas</b> and <b>process</b> <b>gas,</b> it was concluded that there is enough <b>process</b> <b>gas</b> (in terms of energy) to displace all natural gas use. However, the technical specifications of blast-furnace gas (a type of <b>process</b> <b>gas)</b> ensure that not all natural gas can be easily displaced under current circumstances. Several suggestions are made to increase the availability of the most valuable type of <b>process</b> <b>gas</b> (coke oven gas). Finally, it is proposed to combine multiple types of <b>process</b> <b>gas</b> into a mixed gas that is sufficient in terms of both availability and technical characteristics. At a total cost of 177 million euros, over 5. 9 PJ (61 %) worth of natural gas can be saved annually by converting to <b>process</b> <b>gas.</b> Though technically feasible, project profitability is highly sensitive to the relative cost of natural <b>gas</b> versus <b>process</b> <b>gas.</b> Predicted payback periods for individual plant cluster conversion range from 1. 2 to 39. 1 years. A large body of research suggests that seemingly economically viable energy efficiency improvements are often not implemented. Using the Cagno et al. (2013) framework, technologists at each natural gas using plant cluster were interviewed to identify which barriers inhibit the displacement of natural <b>gas</b> with <b>process</b> <b>gas.</b> Combined with techno-economic results, this provided a broad overview of the potential to displace natural <b>gas</b> with <b>process</b> <b>gas</b> at TSIJ. It was identified that most barriers to the conversion to <b>process</b> <b>gas</b> are economic in nature. Low capital availability forces an enhanced emphasis on profitability of projects. This leads to prioritizing production quality and quantity, and limits the time and resources available for energy efficiency projects. Similar results are found in literature. A notable difference from literature is the perception at TSIJ that neither competence nor informational issues inhibit conversion to <b>process</b> <b>gas.</b> Displacing natural <b>gas</b> with <b>process</b> <b>gas</b> is technically and economically viable under certain circumstances and can contribute significantly to the reduction of natural gas use at TSIJ. Barriers to adoption are mostly economic in nature and will likely diminish if energy prices go up...|$|R

50|$|Pyrolytic steam {{is often}} used to {{generate}} oxide thicknesses greater than 1000 Angstom. This steam is generated from the combination at high temperature of hydrogen and oxygen gases. The combustion process occurs either in a stainless steel catalytic oven or on a silicon torch {{at the entrance to the}} furnace. The gases combine into water vapor and are delivered directly to process. Because of the explosive risk associated with hydrogen, the process usually delivers an extra 10% oxygen flow. The purity level of pyrolytic steam depends on the purity of the <b>process</b> <b>gases</b> and the process temperature. The torch tip is typically quartz silica, which is known to be consumed over time by the flame, which may generate particulate downstream. Particle generation can also be an issue due to the velocity of high temperature combustion. Within its optimal operating range, torches deliver good purity.|$|E
5000|$|With {{applications}} requiring {{measurement of}} pressures between [...] and [...] Torr, {{the problem of}} ambient and <b>process</b> <b>gases</b> can be significantly reduced by replacing the OIS configuration with a CIS sampling system.

The ions are formed close to a single extraction plate and exit the ionizer. Electrically insulated alumina rings seal the tube and the biased electrodes {{from the rest of the}} quadrupole mass assembly. The ions are produced by electron impact directly at the process pressure. Such design has been applied to gas chromatography mass spectrometry instruments before adaption by quadrupole gas analyzers. Most commercially available CIS systems operate between [...] and [...] Torr and offer ppm level detectability over the entire mass range for process pressures between [...] and [...] Torr. The upper limit is set by reduction in mean free path for ion-neutral collisions which takes place at higher pressures, and results in the scattering of ions and reduced sensitivity.|$|E

The use of O 2 as the <b>process</b> <b>gas</b> was seen to result in glazes with far fewer microcracks and porosities than those generated {{with any of the}} other three gasses, particularly He. Such differences were found to be due to the ability of the smaller O 2 gas molecules to dissolve molecularly into the open structure of the HPDL generated enamel glaze and also, the inherent reactiveness of O 2 which consequently effects exothermic reactions when it is used as a <b>process</b> <b>gas.</b> Both occurrences were seen, in turn, to affect the cooling rate and therefore the tendency of the molten glaze to generate microcracks when cooled...|$|R
