In this paper, the design of an analog complex gammatone filter is introduced in order to extract both envelope and phase information of the incoming speech signals {{as well as to}} emulate the basilar membrane spectral selectivity. The gammatone impulse response is first transformed into the frequency domain and the resulting 8 th-order transfer function is subsequently mapped onto a state-space description of an orthonormal ladder filter. Using this approach, the real and imaginary transfer functions that share the same denominator can be extracted using two different C matrices. This results in a compact filter structure. The proposed filter is designed using Gm-C integrators and sub-threshold CMOS devices in AMIS 0. 35 μm technology.

Optimization, image processing, Diagnosis and many other applications are made very simple through neural networks, which are difficult and time consuming when conventional methods are used for their implementation. Neural Network is the simplified version of human brain. Like human brain, neural networks also exhibit efficient performance on perceptive tasks like recognition of visual images of objects and handwritten characters etc: Recognition of handwritten digits {{is one of the oldest}} applications of ANN. The recognition of digits written in different handwritings and also from scanned text has remained a trouble thus it has received much attention of researchers in the field of artificial neural networks.

40|$|Cochlear Implants (CIs) are {{prosthetic}} {{devices that}} restore hearing in profoundly deaf patients by bypassing the damaged {{parts of the}} inner ear and directly stimulating the remaining auditory nerve fibers in the cochlea with electrical pulses. This thesis describs the electronic circuit design of various modules for application in CIs {{in order to save}} area, reduce power consumption and ultimately move towards a fully implantable CI. To enhance the perception of tonal languages (such as Thai and Chinese) and music, an effort to realize the speech processor in a CI that imitates the inner hair cells and the auditory nerve behaviour more precisely should be made. According to recent physiological experiments, the envelope and phase of speech signals are required to enhance the <b>perceptive</b> <b>capability</b> of a CI implanted patient. The design of an analog complex gammatone filter is introduced in order to extract both envelope and phase information of the incoming speech signals as well as to emulate the basilar membrane behavior. A subthreshold Gm ? C circuit topology is selected in order to verify the feasibility of the complex gammatone filter at very low power operation. Several speech encoding strategies like continuous time interleaved sampling (CIS), race-to-spike asynchronous interleaved sampling (AIS), phase-locking zero-crossing detection (PL-ZCD) and phase-locking peak-picking (PL-PP) are studied and compared in order to find a compact analog speech processor that allows for full implantation and is able to convey both time and frequency components of the incoming speech to a set of electrical pulse stimuli. A comparison of the input and reconstructed speech signals in terms of correlation factor and hardware complexity pointed out that a PL-PP strategy provides a compact solution for the CI electronic hardware design since this strategy does not require a high precision envelope detector. A subthreshold CMOS peak-instant detector to be used in a PL-PP CI processor has been designed. Circuit simulations, using AMIS 0. 35 um technology, show that the proposed detector can be operated from a 1. 2 V supply and consumes less than 1 uW static power for detecting a 5 kHz input signal. The output signal of the detector together with the input signal amplitude (the output of the band-pass of each channel) is expected to be used as control parameters in a stimulator for apical cochlear electrodes. To design stimulators that are implanted inside the body, there are very strict requirements on the size and power consumption. Therefore, it is important to convey as much charge as possible into the tissue while using an as low as possible supply voltage to minimize power consumption. A novel method for maximizing the charge transfer for constant current neural stimulators has been presented. This concept requires a few additional current branches to form two feedback loops to increase the output resistance of a MOS current mirror circuit that requires only one effective drain-source voltage drop. The main benefit we achieve for neural stimulation is the larger amount of charge that can be conveyed to the stimulation electrode. In other words, for the same amount of charge required, the supply voltage can be reduced. Also, a compact programmable biphasic stimulator for cochlear implants has been designed by using the the above concept and implemented in AMS 0. 18 um high-voltage CMOS IC technology, using an active chip area of only 0. 042 mm^ 2. Measurement results show that a proper charge balance of the anodic and cathodic stimulation phases is achieved and a dc blocking capacitor can be omitted. The resulting reduction in the required area enables many stimulation channels on a single die. As the work laid out in this thesis produced only stand-alone modules, future work should focus on combining all these modules together to form an analog CI processor suitable for a fully implantable cochlear implant.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} learning unmodelled dynamics or environmental effects on a ground robotic ve-hicle {{for the purpose of}} incorporating this information into path-planning strategies. To do so, we {{consider the}} model disturbance as the difference between the state information given by commanded control inputs and a ground-truth which is obtained onboard via sensors. We represent the model disturbance as a random process whose distributional prop-erties depend on the state variables, environmental effects, and <b>perceptive</b> <b>capabilities</b> of the platform. To characterize the model disturbance, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem where the feature space is a concatenation of state and sensory information of the robot, and the decision variable is a regressor on statistical estimators of the model disturbance. Since the relationship between the feature space and decision variable is highly nonlinear, we solve this problem using online task-driven dictionary learning methods. Experiments on a deployed ground robotic platform demonstrate the proposed method’s ability to characterize the statistical interplay between unmodelled dynamics, environmental effects, and control.

50|$|In {{order to}} use {{infrasound}} for navigation, {{it is necessary}} to be able to localize the source of the sounds. The known mechanisms for sound localizations make use of the time difference cues at the two ears. However, infrasound has such long wavelengths that these mechanisms would not be effective for an animal the size of a pigeon. An alternative method that has been hypothesized is through the use of the Doppler shift. A Doppler shift occurs when there is relative motion between a sound source and a perceiver and slightly shifts the perceived frequency of the sound. When a flying bird is changing direction, the amplitude of the Doppler shift between it and an infrasonic source would change, enabling the bird to locate the source. This kind of mechanism would require the ability to detect very small changes in frequency. A pigeon typically flies at 20 km/hr, so a turn could cause up to a 12% modulation of an infrasonic stimulus. According to response measurements, pigeons are able to distinguish frequency changes of 1-7% in the infrasonic range, showing that the use of Doppler shifts for infrasound localization may be within the pigeon’s <b>perceptive</b> <b>capabilities.</b>|$|R

Current sensors simply do not match human <b>perceptive</b> <b>capabilities,</b> impeding progress towards full autonomy. Recent work has shown the value of humans as sources of information within a human-robot team; in target applications, communicating human-generated ‘soft data’ to autonomous systems enables higher levels of autonomy through large, efficient information gains. This requires development of a ‘human sensor model’ that allows soft data fusion through Bayesian inference to update the probabilistic belief representations maintained by autonomous systems. Current human sensor models that capture linguistic inputs as semantic information are limited {{in their ability to}} generalize likelihood functions for semantic statements: they may be learned from dense data; they do not exploit the contextual information embedded within groundings; and they often limit human input to restrictive and simplistic interfaces.

40|$|Abstract. Pedestrian {{injuries}} and fatalities {{are one of}} the most significant problems related to travel and road safety. Pedestrians are vulnerable users of roads and due to the very different velocities and mass when compared to vehicles like cars and trucks, and very often they undergo serious injuries in case of collisions. Older pedestrians are even more vulnerable to {{injuries and}} fatalities due to (i) their reduced mobility and reflexes and (ii) their increased fragility when compared to young individuals. Crosswalks are the point where pedestrians face lower level of safety because they have to cross the street and must be aware of the incoming traffic. Such kind of awareness becomes difficult in case of old pedestrians because of their reduced physical and <b>perceptive</b> <b>capabilities.</b> Besides other factors, lower speed of an old pedestrian is an important factor that limits the mobility of old pedestrians and it also increases the risk of fatalities while crossing the road. In this paper, we developed vision based intelligent system that can detect low speeds and directions of pedestrians and can help him/her by (a) increasing the time associated to a green light for pedestrians, (b) using audible signals to help the pedestrians understanding that there are cars approaching the crossing. ...|$|R

40|$|At {{the core}} of this {{doctoral}} submission is a portfolio of three of my recent choreographic works(all created between 2011 - 2014), complemented by a text, which attempts to formulate a theoretical approach for explicating the works, through the lens of Theodor Adorno’s theory of the inherent negativity of modernist artworks. Such an approach places Adorno’s ideas at the very centre of the analytical view presented here, albeit via the semiotic (re) articulation of these same ideas in recent work by Christoph Menke. This, in turn, draws on earlier work done within aesthetic semiotics by Viktor Shklovsky, through which it is hoped that insight, clarification, and historical contextualisation will be forthcoming, whilst also casting an eye on the contemporary situation within arts making. The thesis is therefore a theoretical analysis of aesthetically negative philosophical thought within choreographic practice, but simultaneously it is an attempt to point to new knowledge; namely an enhancement of Menke's semiotic reading of Adorno, extended from the field of literature from which it originates, and brought into the field of dance, movement, and choreography. In addition to this, a vital second aspect of my approach will be a consideration of the extra - semiotic aspects of dance, read through a phenomenological understanding of kinaesthesia, and how our understanding of movement and choreography is rooted in basic aspects of our <b>perceptive</b> <b>capabilities.</b> Prior to the introduction, the beginning of this thesis, there is a presentation of factual information regarding the production aspects of the performances in a brief Foreword. The structure of the thesis is then as follows. The Introduction offers a short historic overview of Adorno’s theory of ‘aesthetic negativity’, and this is followed by three Chapters, titled: (1) Object and Subject, (2) Recombination, and (3) Projection. These three notions are not only essential to my work as methodological tools, but they also provide important references, connections and bilateral correspondences to similar concepts within Adorno’s aesthetic theory, thereby clarifying the relationship between theory and practice in my work.

40|$|Autonomous robots {{operating}} in real environments {{need to be}} able to interact with a dynamic world populated with objects, people, and, in general, other agents. The current generation of autonomous robots, such as the ASIMO robot by Honda or the QRIO by Sony, has showed impressive performances in mechanics and control of movements; moreover, recent literature reports encouraging results about the capability of such robots of representing themselves with respect to a dynamic external world, of planning future actions and of evaluating resulting situations in order to make new plans. However, when multiple robots are supposed to operate together, coordination and communication issues arise; while noteworthy results have been achieved with respect to the control of a single robot, novel issues arise when the actions of a robot influence another"s behavior. The increase in computational power available to systems nowadays makes it feasible, and even convenient, to organize them into a single distributed computing environment in order to exploit the synergy among different entities. This is especially true for robot teams, where cooperation is supposed to be the most natural scheme of operation, especially when robots are required to operate in highly constrained scenarios, such as inhospitable sites, remote sites, or indoor environments where strict constraints on intrusiveness must be respected. In this case, computations will be inherently network-centric, and to solve the need for communication inside robot collectives, an efficient network infrastructure must be put into place; once a proper communication channel is established, multiple robots may benefit from the interaction with each other in order to achieve a common goal. The framework presented in this paper adopts a composite networking architecture, in which a hybrid wireless network, composed by commonly available WiFi devices, and the more recently developed wireless sensor networks, operates as a whole in order both to provide a communication backbone for the robots and to extract useful information from the environment. The ad-hoc WiFi backbone allows robots to exchange coordination information among themselves, while also carrying data measurements collected from surrounding environment, and useful for localization or mere data gathering purposes. The proposed framework is called RoboNet, and extends a previously developed robotic tour guide application (Chella et al., 2007) in the context of a multi-robot application; our system allows a team of robots to enhance their <b>perceptive</b> <b>capabilities</b> through coordination obtained via a hybrid communication network; moreover, the same infrastructure allows robots to exchange information so as to coordinate their actions in order to achieve a global common goal. The working scenario considered in this paper consists of a museum setting, where guided tours are to be automatically managed. The museum is arranged both chronologically and topographically, but the sequence of findings to be visited can be rearranged depending on user queries, making a sort of dynamic virtual labyrinth with various itineraries. Therefore, the robots are able to guide visitors both in prearranged tours and in interactive tours, built in itinere depending on the interaction with the visitor: robots are able to rebuild the virtual connection between findings and, consequently, the path to be followed. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains some background on multi-robot coordination, and Section 3 describes the underlying ideas and the motivation behind the proposed architecture, whose details are presented in Sections 4, 5, and 6. A realistic application scenario is described in Section 7, and finally our conclusions are drawn in Section 8...|$|R
40|$|Current {{technological}} and research developments pertaining to Ambient Intelligence, Ubiquitous Computing or Pervasive Computing, share an impetus towards embedding computation in our social and physical environments {{making it an}} inseparable part of our daily lives. One consequence of embedding technology in this way in our everyday lifeworld is that today’s user-system interaction paradigm will change substantially. Interaction {{is expected to be}} continuous, prolonged, and tied in with the physical spaces that surround us. It will involve a disparate range of interaction devices, affect social interactions and will often bridge physical and virtual worlds. Additionally, technology is expected to become more intelligent and to adapt itself to our needs and the dynamics of the environments we live in. To make this possible AmI systems will need to be equipped with sensorial and reasoning capabilities. One consequence of confronting users with for example home dialogue systems that have <b>perceptive</b> and reasoning <b>capabilities</b> is that additional expectations are created. Since people already have a tendency to attribute human like properties to interactive systems, it is expected that implementing human like properties in such home dialogue systems will have an important impact on the usersystem interaction. Similar observations can be made for other environments, e. g. smart office environments, (virtual) collaborative work or meeting environments and smart educational environments. In this chapter we look at user-system interaction from this particular viewpoint. How can we include aspects of human social interaction in the interface and what difference will it make? We will investigate this in the paradigm of Ambient Intelligence...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{some of the}} antecedents {{and consequences}} of career decision status (i. e., being decided about and comfortable with career decisions). Antecedents investigated included: age, university level, work experience (quality and quantity), and accuracy of self-ratings. Work outcomes (as measured by job satisfaction, organisational commitment and performance) were the consequences of career decision status explored in this thesis. When the antecedents of age, university level and quantity of work experience were reviewed cross-sectionally all contributed to career decision status. It was concluded that age best predicted decidedness suggesting {{that the development of}} career decision status is part of a maturation process. Volume measured by the number of hours worked rather than pattern of work (i. e., full-time vs. part-time vs. casual) determined variability in scores on the career measures. Breadth of work experience (measured by number of jobs and employers) did not influence career decision status. When explored longitudinally it was found that decidedness decreased after participating in the work force and work experience programs. Quality rather than quantity of work experience was a more significant predictor of decidedness. Work experience and graduate programs should focus on the quality of experience provided, rather than quantity of time spent, if the purpose is to contribute to career decision making. In comparing the self-ratings of decided and undecided students it was found that decided students were no more <b>perceptive</b> about their <b>capabilities</b> than those who were undecided. This suggests that self-rating measures should be used in conjunction with objective measures if this information is to be used for the purpose of vocational assessments, even when students claim to be decided about their career choice. Some evidence exists to suggest that students rating themselves higher on comfort with career decisions were more capable of matching their career interests with job advertisements rather than on occupational titles alone. Comfort levels in career decision making may have an important role in evaluating available opportunities. In examining the relationship between work outcomes and career decision status in a longitudinal design it was concluded that job satisfaction promotes career comfort, decidedness predicts organisational commitment and this relationship is moderated by met expectations, and that neither being decided or comfortable predicts performance. Some evidence was found to suggest that those employees claiming high self-clarity (i. e., knowledge of their abilities, skills, and personality) were rated as higher performers. It may be beneficial for organisations to direct their efforts towards promoting comfort by providing quality work experience, and helping employees to clarify their strengths in terms of interests, abilities and attributes. It was concluded that career decidedness is still relevant to a contemporary work environment, but that comfort with career decisions has the potential for far greater impact...|$|R
