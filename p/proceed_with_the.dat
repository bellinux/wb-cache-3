By the early 1970s he had decided there were new avenues to explore, and the BBC planned a fourth Quatermass serial in 1972.

5|$|In 1969, a 500 MW {{nuclear power}} plant was {{proposed}} for the Jervis Bay Territory, 200km south of Sydney.

She also claimed that the estate of Orson Welles was owed 20% of the film's profits if her copyright claim was not upheld.

5|$|In early 1973, the Architectural Review {{submitted}} {{a proposal to}} convert the Albert Bridge into a landscaped public park and pedestrian footpath across the river. The proposal proved very popular with the area's residents, and a May 1973 campaign led by John Betjeman, Sybil Thorndike and Laurie Lee raised a petition of 2,000signatures for the bridge to be permanently closed to traffic. Although the GLC reopened the bridge to traffic in July 1973, it also announced its intention to <b>proceed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Architectural Review scheme once legal matters had been dealt with.|$|E

The director, in an interview with The New Indian Express, stated that he wrote the screenplay with Mohanlal in mind and that the character was tailor-made for Mohanlal. He later added that no changes were made in the script when Mohanlal agreed.|$|E

5|$|Mumma {{arrived back}} in the United States in December 1945, and {{returned}} to the Bureau of Ships. The Bureau's immediate post war priority was to develop nuclear propulsion for ships. With the Chief of the Bureau, Rear Admiral Earle W. Mills, and Captain Paul F. Lee, he went to see Groves and Brigadier General Kenneth Nichols, the commander of the Manhattan District, who were willing to help, but would not offer any fissionable material. The Navy decided to <b>proceed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> design of a nuclear-powered ship.|$|E
5|$|On 20 September 1939 the Australian War Cabinet {{approved}} {{the formation of}} a RAAF Expeditionary Force for overseas service which would have included a wing designated No. 1 Fighter Wing as well as two wings of bombers. Under the approved structure for the Expeditionary Force, No. 1 Fighter Wing was to command No.7 and No. 15 Squadrons. This plan proved short-lived as on 20 October the Government announced that the formation of the Expeditionary Force would not <b>proceed,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Empire Air Training Scheme instead being the RAAF's main contribution to overseas campaigns.|$|E

The rain and the torch-lit atmosphere of the surroundings made U2's performance dramatic.

Following the outbreak of World War I in August, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral Sir John Jellicoe. The following month, the ship was refitted at HM Dockyard, Devonport and rejoined the Grand Fleet at the beginning of October.|$|E

When Operation Badr began at 14:00, Rear Admiral Fuad Abu Zikry {{authorized}} the fleet to <b>proceed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> blockade via a codeword. Egyptian submarines and destroyers intercepted ships traveling through Bab-el-Mandeb destined for Eilat, and all Israeli maritime navigation in the Red Sea ceased. The blockade was a strategic success for Egypt, while the Israeli Navy and Air Force were incapable of lifting the blockade {{due to the}} long distance between Israel and Bab-el-Mandeb. Mines were laid {{at the entrance to}} the Gulf of Suez to prevent Israel from transporting oil from the Sinai fields to Eilat. Historian Gammal Hammad claims that a blockade was also enforced in the Mediterranean, while other sources dispute this. News of the blockade was censored in Israel.|$|E

In light of open interest expressed by figures within the U.S. and West Germany, the British government approached these nations with an offer to collaborate on the project and to seek contributions towards the cost involved. Following the acceptance of all three nations, on 22 May 1962, Hawker received a formal Instruction to <b>Proceed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> procurement of materials for the construction of the nine aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Edward N. Hall was {{responsible}} for making the arrangements for the deployment. Two alternative plans were presented to Quarles, now the United States Deputy Secretary of Defense. One was for the United States to shoulder the cost, which would facilitate the fastest possible deployment. The other was for an {{agreement to be reached}} on sharing costs with the British, which would take longer. Quarles shared the plans with Eisenhower and Macmillan in Bermuda, and directed Hall to <b>proceed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> deployment as fast as the first plan, but with the costs of the second. The result was a slower, more costly deployment. A formal agreement was drawn up on 17 December 1957, although {{it was not until the}} end of the month that it was definitely determined that Britain would receive Thor and not Jupiter missiles. The deployment of Thor missiles was codenamed Project Emily.|$|E
