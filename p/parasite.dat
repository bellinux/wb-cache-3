5|$|<b>Parasite</b> Eve I & II Original Soundtrack Box is a {{combined}} album featuring the re-releases {{of the first}} two <b>Parasite</b> Eve soundtracks. It was released on January 26, 2011. Reviews of the boxset were mixed: while some considered both soundtracks to be good and contrast each other, others considered <b>Parasite</b> Eve II to be weaker and a detriment to the experience.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} parasites that inhibit the bluespotted stingray, {{this is a}} table of the common groups of the <b>parasite,</b> and the {{specific}} name of the <b>parasite.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>parasite</b> {{responsible}} for P.falciparum malaria {{has been in}} existence for 50,000–100,000 years, the population size of the <b>parasite</b> did not increase until about 10,000 years ago, concurrently with advances in agriculture {{and the development of}} human settlements. Close relatives of the human malaria parasites remain common in chimpanzees. Some evidence suggests that the P.falciparum malaria may have originated in gorillas.|$|E
25|$|<b>Parasites</b> infect hosts {{within their}} same {{geographical}} area (sympatric) more effectively. This phenomenon supports the Red Queen hypothesis, {{which states that}} interactions between species, such as host and <b>parasites,</b> lead to constant natural selection for coadaptation. <b>Parasites</b> track the locally common hosts' phenotypes, so the <b>parasites</b> are less infective to allopatric hosts, those from different geographical regions. When populations of lake snails were exposed to two pure <b>parasites</b> (digenetic trematode), whether sympatric <b>parasites,</b> allopatric <b>parasites</b> or a mixture, the <b>parasites</b> were more effective in infecting their sympatric snails than their allopatric snails. The <b>parasites</b> were apparently adapted to infect local populations of snails.|$|R
40|$|Human {{intestinal}} helminths {{are described}} in this paper. They can be over a meter long, with an irregular cylindrical shape, resembling a rope. These anaerobic intestinal "rope" <b>parasites</b> differ significantly from other well-known intestinal <b>parasites.</b> Rope <b>parasites</b> can leave human body with enemas, and are often mistaken for intestinal lining, feces, or decayed remains of other <b>parasites.</b> Rope <b>parasites</b> can attach to intestinal walls with suction bubbles, which later develop into suction heads. Walls of the rope <b>parasites</b> consist of scale-like cells forming multiple branched channels along the <b>parasite's</b> length. Rope <b>parasites</b> can move by jet propulsion, passing gas bubbles through these channels. Currently known antihelminthic methods include special enemas. Most humans are likely hosting these helminths...|$|R
50|$|The Sundevall's jird can be {{occupied}} {{by a variety of}} <b>parasites,</b> especially species of fleas. It has been found that male Sundevall's jird harbor more species of <b>parasites</b> than females do, which is still being studied. Along with <b>parasites</b> come the <b>parasites</b> of <b>parasites,</b> in this case bacteria. Bacteria can be transmitted to the Sundevall's jird by the flea biting the rodent.|$|R
5|$|Before The 3rd Birthdays {{release in}} 2010, both Yoshinori Kitase and Tetsuya Nomura {{discussed}} the re-release of <b>Parasite</b> Eve and <b>Parasite</b> Eve II. The release {{was being held}} up {{partly due to the}} series rights being co-owned with Hideaki Sena.|$|E
5|$|Lactifluus piperatus forms part of {{an unusual}} and highly {{regarded}} dish in North America, being one of several species parasitized by the lobster mushroom Hypomyces lactifluorum. Once colonized by the <b>parasite,</b> an orange-red crust forms {{over the surface of}} the mushroom, and the taste becomes delicious as the <b>parasite</b> infiltrates its host's tissues. It is also a common source of food among red squirrels.|$|E
5|$|<b>Parasite</b> Eve is a 1998 {{survival}} horror action role-playing {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Square. The game is a sequel to the novel <b>Parasite</b> Eve written by Hideaki Sena; {{it is also the}} first game in the <b>Parasite</b> Eve video game series. The story follows New York City police officer Aya Brea over a six-day span in 1997 as she attempts to stop the Eve, a woman who plans to destroy the human race through spontaneous human combustion. Players explore levels set in areas of New York while utilizing a pausable real-time combat system along with several role-playing game elements.|$|E
40|$|<b>Parasites</b> and hosts {{have long}} {{evolutionary}} histories that have seen many innovations and adaptations. Natural populations of <b>parasites</b> {{have an interest}} in preventing too much damage to their host populations, but modern agriculture has created new environments where <b>parasites</b> and hosts do not interact as they once did. The new environments favour the <b>parasites,</b> and the hosts need our help to keep the <b>parasites</b> under control. To make the new environments favour the hosts, we have begun a war with the <b>parasites.</b> Our main strategy is to kill the <b>parasites</b> with drugs. We are fighting a chemical war. The <b>parasites,</b> though, are finding ways to defend themselves. They are fighting a genetic war. I will briefly discuss some of the genetic aspects of the war that often sees the <b>parasites</b> winning as they acquire resistance to our chemicals...|$|R
50|$|Experiments {{published}} in 2000 discuss {{the analysis of}} two different snail populations from two different sources—Lake Ianthe and Lake Poerua in New Zealand. The populations were exposed to two pure <b>parasites</b> (digenetic trematode) taken from the same lakes. In the experiment, the snails were infected by their sympatric <b>parasites,</b> allopatric <b>parasites</b> and mixed sources of <b>parasites.</b> The {{results suggest that the}} <b>parasites</b> were more highly effective in infecting their sympatric snails than their allopatric snails. Though the allopatric snails were still infected by the <b>parasites,</b> the infectivity was much less when compared to the sympatric snails. Hence, the <b>parasites</b> were found to have adapted to infecting local populations of snails.|$|R
40|$|Artemisinin induced {{dormancy}} is {{a proposed}} mechanism for failures of mono-therapy and is linked with artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum. The biological characterization and dynamics of dormant <b>parasites</b> {{are not well}} understood. Here we report that following dihydroartemisinin (DHA) treatment in vitro, a small subset of morphologically dormant <b>parasites</b> was stained with rhodamine 123 (RH), a mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) marker, and persisted to recovery. FACS sorted RH-positive <b>parasites</b> resumed growth at 10, 000 /well while RH-negative <b>parasites</b> failed to recover at 5 million/well. Furthermore, transcriptional activity for mitochondrial enzymes was only detected in RH-positive dormant <b>parasites.</b> Importantly, after treating dormant <b>parasites</b> with different concentrations of atovaquone, a mitochondrial inhibitor, the recovery of dormant <b>parasites</b> was delayed or stopped. This demonstrates that mitochondrial activity is critical for survival and regrowth of dormant <b>parasites</b> and that RH staining provides a means of identifying these <b>parasites.</b> These findings provide novel paths for studying and eradicating this dormant stage...|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} <b>Parasite</b> Eve Original Soundtrack {{album was}} released in May 1998 through DigiCube. Shimomura also produced an arrange album, <b>Parasite</b> Eve Remixes, which was released through DigiCube in July 1998. The soundtrack album for the second game, <b>Parasite</b> Eve II Original Soundtrack, was released through DigiCube in December 1999. It also released in North America through Tokyopop Soundtrax in September 2000. The third game's soundtrack album, The 3rd Birthday Original Soundtrack, released in December 2010 through Square Enix's music label. The first two game's original soundtracks were reissued through Square Enix in January 2010 due to popular demand, and a limited edition combined album titled <b>Parasite</b> Eve I & II Original Soundtrack Box was released alongside them. While some albums have received mixed responses from critics, {{the music of the}} <b>Parasite</b> Eve series has generally received positive reviews, with the score for the first game bringing Shimomura international acclaim.|$|E
5|$|The <b>parasite</b> is {{relatively}} protected from {{attack by the}} body's immune system because {{for most of its}} human life cycle it resides within the liver and blood cells and {{is relatively}} invisible to immune surveillance. However, circulating infected blood cells are destroyed in the spleen. To avoid this fate, the P.falciparum <b>parasite</b> displays adhesive proteins {{on the surface of the}} infected blood cells, causing the blood cells to stick to the walls of small blood vessels, thereby sequestering the <b>parasite</b> from passage through the general circulation and the spleen. The blockage of the microvasculature causes symptoms such as in placental malaria. Sequestered red blood cells can breach the blood–brain barrier and cause cerebral malaria.|$|E
5|$|The parasite/host {{relationship}} probably {{drove the}} prevalence of sexual reproduction over the more efficient asexual reproduction. It seems that when a <b>parasite</b> infects a host, sexual reproduction affords {{a better chance of}} developing resistance (through variation in the next generation), giving sexual reproduction variability for fitness not seen in the asexual reproduction, which produces another generation of the organism susceptible to infection by the same <b>parasite.</b> Coevolution between host and <b>parasite</b> may accordingly be responsible for much of the genetic diversity seen in normal populations, including blood-plasma polymorphism, protein polymorphism, and histocompatibility systems.|$|E
50|$|In turn, host {{defenses}} coevolve {{in response}} to attacks by <b>parasites.</b> Theoretically, <b>parasites</b> may have an advantage in this evolutionary arms race because their generation time commonly is shorter. Hosts reproduce less quickly than <b>parasites,</b> and therefore have fewer chances to adapt than their <b>parasites</b> do over a given span of time.|$|R
5000|$|Melanoides tuberculata {{is known}} to carry certain <b>parasites</b> which can be {{dangerous}} to humans. Pinto & de Melo (2011) compiled a checklist of 37 species of trematode <b>parasites</b> from this species of snail. Eleven of those trematodes are also <b>parasites</b> of human. These snails serve as first intermediate host for <b>parasites</b> which include: ...|$|R

5|$|A 2012 {{study on}} the effects of {{rainfall}} patterns and <b>parasite</b> infections on the body of the springbok in Etosha National Park observed that males and juveniles were in better health {{toward the end of the}} rainy season. Health of females was more affected by parasites than by rainfall; <b>parasite</b> count in females peaked prior to and immediately after parturition. Studies show that springbok host helminths (Haemonchus, Longistrongylus and Trichostrongylus), ixodid ticks (Rhipicephalus species), lice (Damalinia and Linognathus species). Eimeria species mainly affect juveniles.|$|E
5|$|As a countermeasure, {{cultures}} of the nematode Deladenus siricidicola {{have been used as}} biological control to protect trees since the 1980s. This <b>parasite</b> feeds on the mycelia of A.areolatum and is therefore a food competitor of wood wasp larvae. Where S.noctilio larvae are present, the <b>parasite</b> infects and sterilizes the eggs of female wasps, causing them to be infertile. These infertile females lay infected eggs into new trees and thus spread the nematode. This control method has proven to be relatively successful to combat the Sirex–Amylostereum complex. In the Southern Hemisphere, where the technique has been widely employed, reductions of parasitism levels of 70%–100% have been achieved.|$|E
25|$|Veterinary {{parasitology}} studies both {{external and}} internal <b>parasites</b> in animals. External <b>parasites,</b> such as fleas, mites, ticks and mosquitoes can cause skin irritation and are often carriers of other diseases or of internal <b>parasites.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{variety of}} <b>parasites</b> have been {{recorded}} from the marsh rice rat (Oryzomys palustris), a semiaquatic rodent found in the eastern and southern United States, north to New Jersey and Kansas and south to Florida and Texas, and in Tamaulipas, far northeastern Mexico. Some of these <b>parasites</b> are endoparasites, internal <b>parasites,</b> while others are ectoparasites, external <b>parasites.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Parasites</b> infect hosts {{within their}} same {{geographical}} area (sympatric) more effectively. This phenomenon supports the Red Queen hypothesis, {{which states that}} interactions between species, such as host and <b>parasites,</b> lead to constant natural selection for co-adaptation. <b>Parasites</b> track the locally common hosts' phenotypes, therefore the <b>parasites</b> are less infective to allopatric (from different geographical region) hosts.|$|R

5|$|Her {{best known}} work was a {{comprehensive}} study of Plasmodium, the malaria <b>parasite,</b> and investigation of various chemotherapies for the disease. Later she studied drug resistance in this <b>parasite,</b> research that proved valuable to the British military in World War II. She discovered the potential for cross-resistance in these parasites during that same period. Bishop also discovered the protozoan Pseudotrichomonas keilini and worked with Aedes aegypti, a malaria vector, {{as part of her}} research on the disease. Elected to the Royal Society in 1959, Bishop was the founder of the British Society for Parasitology and served on the World Health Organization's Malaria Committee.|$|E
5|$|Just as predators such as {{angler fish}} have a {{structure}} that lures prey, so some parasites mimic their host's natural prey, but with roles reversed; the <b>parasite</b> gets eaten by the host. This deception provides the <b>parasite</b> easy entry into the host, which they can then feed upon, allowing them to continue their life cycle. Researchers {{may be able to}} predict the host of such parasites based on their appearance and behavior.|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of the {{processes}} favouring the establishment of exotic <b>parasites</b> is poor. Herein, we test the characteristics of successful exotic <b>parasites</b> that have co-established in the remote island archipelago of New Zealand, due {{to the introduction of}} numerous avian host species. Our results show that avian malaria <b>parasites</b> (AM; <b>parasites</b> of the genus Plasmodium) that successfully invaded are more globally generalist (both geographically widespread and with a broad taxonomic range of hosts) than AM <b>parasites</b> not co-introduced to New Zealand. Furthermore, the successful AM <b>parasites</b> are presently more prevalent in their native range than AM <b>parasites</b> found in the same native range but not co-introduced to New Zealand. This has resulted in an increased number and greater taxonomic diversity of AM <b>parasites</b> now in New Zealand. John G. Ewen, Staffan Bensch, Tim M.

40|$|Several <b>parasites</b> infest liver or biliary tree, either {{during their}} {{maturation}} stages or as adult worms. Bile iry tree <b>parasites</b> may cause pancreatitis, cholecystitis, biliary tree obstruction, recurrent cholangitis, biliary tree strictures and some {{may lead to}} cholangiocarcinoma. This review discusses the hepatobiliary <b>parasites,</b> and shows our experience in diagnosis and management of these <b>parasites.</b> Ultrasonography of the liver is diagnostic in schistosomiasis, hydatid cysts, amebic liver abscess, ascariasis and other biliary tree <b>parasites</b> showing bile duct dilatation. Percutaneous aspiration under ultrasonography guidance of hydatid liver cysts or amebic abscess are effective measures in management. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is safe and effective in diagnosis and management of biliary tree <b>parasites...</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>Parasite</b> Eve II Original Soundtrack was {{released}} through DigiCube on December 18, 1999 under the catalog number SSCX-10038. The soundtrack {{was released}} in North America through Tokyopop Soundtrax. This edition was released on September 12, 2000 under the catalog number TPCD-0200-2. Due to popular demand from fans, a reprint was issued through the Square Enix label on January 26, 2011 under the catalog number SQEX-10224/5. Reception of the music was far less positive than for <b>Parasite</b> Eve, with reviewers generally citing Mizuta's work as weaker than Shimomura's.|$|E
5|$|Red {{parasitic}} mites sometimes attach {{themselves to}} the dorsal region of crickets and may greatly affect them. The horsehair worm Paragordius varius is an internal <b>parasite</b> and can control the behaviour of its cricket host and cause it to enter water, where the <b>parasite</b> continues its lifecycle and the cricket likely drowns. The larvae of the sarcophagid fly Sarcophaga kellyi develop inside the body cavity of field crickets. Female parasitic wasps of Rhopalosoma lay their eggs on crickets, and their developing larvae gradually devour their hosts. Other wasps in the family Scelionidae are egg parasitoids, seeking out batches of eggs laid by crickets in plant tissues in which to insert their eggs.|$|E
