Ethanol {{inhibited}} NMDA-activated current in a voltage-independent manner, {{and did not}} alter the reversal potential of NMDA-activated current. Concentration–response analysis of NMDA- and glycine-activated current revealed that ethanol decreased the maximal response to both agonists without affecting their EC 50 values. The polyamine spermine (1 [*]μM) increased amplitude of NMDA-activated current but did not alter the <b>percentage</b> <b>inhibition</b> of ethanol. Compared to an extracellular pH of 7. 0, pH 6. 0 decreased and pH 8. 0 increased the amplitude of NMDA-activated current, but these changes in pH did not significantly alter the <b>percentage</b> <b>inhibition</b> by ethanol.

Water extracts of A. natalensis rhizomes exhibited high activity against four bacterial strains; Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus with MIC values of 0. 78  mg/ml. High activity was also observed in the PE and DCM leaf extract of the same plant against the Gram-positive bacteria.

All the extracts showed activity against Candida albicans, with A. natalensis leaf extracts exhibiting the highest antifungal activity with MIC values of 0. 88, 0. 2 and 0. 78  mg/ml for PE, DCM and EtOH respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} {{inhibitory}} effect of various commercially available concentrations of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) solutions on matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). METHODS: Three SDF solutions with concentrations at 38 %, 30 % and 12 % were studied. Two sodium fluoride (NaF) solutions at 10 % and 3 % were prepared, {{and they had}} the same fluoride ion concentrations as 38 % and 12 % SDF, respectively. Two silver nitrate (AgNO(3)) solutions at 42 % and 13 % were also prepared, {{and they had the}} same silver ion concentrations as 38 % and 12 % SDF, respectively. Ten samples of each experimental solution were used to study their inhibitory effect on three MMPs, which were MMP- 2 (gelatinase A), MMP- 8 (neutrophil collagenase) and MMP- 9 (gelatinase B) using MMP assay kits. Positive control containing assay buffer at pH 9 and MMPs dilution was used to calculate the <b>percentage</b> <b>inhibition.</b> RESULTS: The <b>percentage</b> <b>inhibition</b> of 38 %, 30 % and 12 % SDF on MMP- 2 were 79 %, 60 % and 17 %, respectively (p< 0. 001); on MMP- 8 were 94 %, 85 % and 77 %, respectively (p< 0. 001); on MMP- 9 were 82 %, 65 % and 60 %, respectively (p< 0. 001).
