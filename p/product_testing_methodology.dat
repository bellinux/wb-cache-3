40|$|Over {{the last}} decade the number of {{airborne}} lidar systems currently deployed and operating in the field has grown impressively. This growth has intensified the level of competition among lidar equipment manufacturers. As manufacturers vie for increased market share with claims of ever higher accuracy specifications, lidar end users wonder how these specifications actually affect achievable accuracy of the lidar data. Aware of the interest that professional organizations such as ISPRS/ASPRS have shown in establishing quality control guidelines for reporting accuracy in lidar data, Optech Incorporated, a leading manufacturer of airborne lidar equipment, {{conducted a series of}} studies that examined issues that included, among others, vertical accuracy and Position and Orientation System (POS) performance. Since accuracy specifications can be the <b>product</b> of different <b>testing</b> <b>methodologies</b> and subject to the interpretation of data, the final arbiter of competing claims is actual system performance. The studies that Optech carried out included performance analyses of the ALTM 3100 EA laser mapping system. This instrument demonstrated that it is capable of producing mapping data with relative accuracies on the sub-decimeter level. However, the limiting factors in obtaining overall absolute sub-decimeter accuracies are often due to the performance of various subsystems that contribute to the total ALTM error budget. This paper represents the manufacturer's effort to relate the engineering analysis of instrument performance to what is demonstrably achievable accuracy in the lidar data of end users. 1. 1 Overview 1...|$|R

Since no two days are exactly alike with regard to energy harvesting, tests {{must be carried out}} indoors. Solar simulators are traditionally used in replicating the effects of sunlight indoors - however, solar simulators are expensive, have lighting elements that have short lifetimes, and are usually not designed to carry out the types of tests that hardware and algorithm designers require. As a result, hardware and algorithm designers use tests that are inaccurate and not repeatable (both for others and also for the designers themselves).
