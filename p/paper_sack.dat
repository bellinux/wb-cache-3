2500|$|During the 1977–78 season, CBS held a H-O-R-S-E {{competition}} at halftime of the Game of the Week telecasts. Again, Don Criqui hosted with Mendy Rudolph officiating. 32 players, including Rick Barry, Pete Maravich, George Gervin, JoJo White, Doug Collins, Paul Westphal and Bob McAdoo, competed in a round-robin single-elimination tournament each week. Barry was eliminated {{in the first}} round by journeyman Earl Tatum of the Los Angeles Lakers. [...] Maravich and Westphal made {{it all the way to}} the final, which was scheduled to take place at halftime of Game 2 of the 1978 NBA Finals. However, Maravich was injured and unavailable, so CBS instead had Westphal shoot a free-throw against [...] "Bag-Man" [...] (who was actually Rick Barry, who was on the announcing team, wearing a <b>paper</b> <b>sack</b> over his head). Westphal, with a bag over his head as well, made the free throw while Barry missed, and CBS awarded him the trophy.|$|E

I was in Paris, about this time last year, perhaps because I was the only thing in my house that had not been swathed in cheese-cloth, or tied up in a bag with drawstrings, or rolled up with moth-balls and put away in chests. At any rate, I was there. One day I left my wife in New York {{carefully}} tagging three worn-out feather dusters, and putting them into a pillow-case, and tagging it, and putting the pillow-case into a camphorated self-sealing <b>paper</b> <b>sack,</b> and tagging it; and another day I was in Paris, dining at the house of a lady whom I asked how she managed with the things in her house when she went into the country for the summer. 'Leave them just as they are,' she said. 'But what about the dust and the moths, and the rust and the tarnish?' She said, 'Why, the things would have to be all gone over when I came back in the autumn, anyway, and why should I give myself double trouble?' I asked her if she didn't even roll anything up and put it away in closets, and she said: 'Oh, you mean that old American horror of getting ready to go away. I used to go through all that at home, too, but I shouldn't dream of it here. In the first place, there are no closets in the house, and I couldn't put anything away if I wanted to. And really nothing happens. I scatter some Persian powder along the edges of things, and under the lower shelves, and in the dim corners, and I pull down the shades. When I come back in the fall I have the powder swept out, and the shades pulled up, and begin living again. Suppose a little dust has got in, and the moths have nibbled a little here and there? The whole damage would not amount to half the cost of putting everything away and taking everything out, not to speak of the weeks of discomfort, and the wear and tear of spirit. No, thank goodness--I left American housekeeping in America.' I asked her: 'But if you went back?' and she gave a sigh, and said: ...|$|E

50|$|The {{foundation}} of Schauman's paper-and-pulp operations was laid {{with the construction}} of a sulfite pulp mill in Jakobstad in 1934. In the early 1960s, a sulfate pulp mill, a paper mill, and a <b>paper</b> <b>sack</b> plant were added. During {{the first half of the}} 1970s, major investments were made in pulp manufacturing, and this made Schauman the largest producer of market pulp in Finland. The <b>paper</b> <b>sack</b> plant in Jakobstad soon became the largest of its kind in Finland, and in 1969 Schauman purchased the Craf'Sac plant in Rouen, France. Schauman had already become a world leader in plywood product development by the beginning of the 1960s, grabbing additional market share through the use of new and innovative production methods for gluing, coating and processing of plywood, as well as through the use of spruce as raw material.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>paper</b> <b>sack</b> is a {{packaging}} made {{of paper}} high quality and weight, usually kraft virgin fiber, which is normally used for transporting powder materials, such as flour, cement, animal feed, etc. Multi-wall paper bags usually have {{several layers of}} heavy duty kraft paper, sometimes with a highly printed paper on the outside. Plastic films and coated papers are sometimes used as inner layers to provide a moisture barrier, and resistance to rodents and insects.|$|E

50|$|Other {{examples}} are helmipuuro, a porridge made from monodisperse grains of potato starch and milk, and papeda (the Moluccan {{community in the}} Netherlands uses potato starch to make papeda).It is also used in non-food applications as wallpaper adhesive, for textile finishing and textile sizing, in paper coating and sizing, and as an adhesive in <b>paper</b> <b>sacks</b> and gummed tape.|$|R
50|$|Starch {{is used in}} the {{manufacture}} of various adhesives or glues for book-binding, wallpaper adhesives, <b>paper</b> <b>sack</b> production, tube winding, gummed paper, envelope adhesives, school glues and bottle labeling. Starch derivatives, such as yellow dextrins, can be modified by addition of some chemicals to form a hard glue for paper work; some of those forms use borax or soda ash, which are mixed with the starch solution at 50 - 70 C to create a very good adhesive. Sodium silicate can be added to reinforce these formula.|$|E
50|$|The body is {{received}} at a medical examiner's office or hospital {{in a body}} bag or evidence sheet. A new body bag is used for each body to ensure that only evidence from that body is contained within the bag. Evidence sheets are an alternative way to transport the body. An evidence sheet is a sterile sheet that covers the body when it is moved. If it is believed there may be any significant evidence on the hands, for example, gunshot residue or skin under the fingernails, a separate <b>paper</b> <b>sack</b> is put around each hand and taped shut around the wrist.|$|E
50|$|On June 4, 1964, “Pigeon Goldie” Osgood, {{a retired}} {{telephone}} operator {{was found dead}} in her ransacked room by a hotel worker distributing phone books. Ms Osgood, who had earned her nickname {{due to the fact that}} she befriended and fed the birds in nearby Pershing Square, had been stabbed, strangled and raped and near her body were found the Dodgers cap she always wore and a <b>paper</b> <b>sack</b> full of birdseed. Soon after, Jacques B. Ehlinger, 29, was seen walking through Pershing Square in bloodstained clothing. He was arrested, but cleared of the crime, for which no one was ever arrested.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sack</b> kraft <b>paper,</b> or just <b>sack</b> <b>paper,</b> is a porous {{kraft paper}} with high {{elasticity}} and high tear resistance, designed {{for packaging products}} with high demands for strength and durability.|$|R
50|$|<b>Paper</b> <b>sacks</b> {{are usually}} made of Kraft paper having the {{advantage}} of being soft and strong at the same time. The stretch or elongation increases the energy required to break the material. They easily carry and protect products up to 50 kg, and adapt easily to the nature of their contents and to handling constraints. At the same time sacks are provide an excellent media for promotional messages and sophisticated printing designs.|$|R

50|$|One {{example is}} a simple paste made by cooking flour in water. Starch-based {{adhesives}} are used in corrugated board and <b>paper</b> <b>sack</b> production, paper tube winding, and wallpaper adhesives. Casein glue is mainly used to adhere glass bottle labels. Animal glues have traditionally been used in bookbinding, wood joining, and many other areas but now are largely replaced by synthetic glues except in specialist applications like the production and repair of stringed instruments. Albumen made from the protein component of blood {{has been used in}} the plywood industry. Masonite, a wood hardboard, was originally bonded using natural wood lignin, an organic polymer, though most modern particle boards such as MDF use synthetic thermosetting resins.|$|E
25|$|The {{ammonium}} nitrate, needed {{either as}} fertilizer or an explosive, was manufactured in Nebraska and Iowa {{and shipped to}} Texas City by rail before being loaded on the Grandcamp. It was manufactured in a patented process, mixed with clay, petrolatum, rosin and paraffin wax to avoid moisture caking. It was also packaged in <b>paper</b> <b>sacks,</b> then transported and stored at temperatures that increased its chemical activity.

50|$|Wood pulp for sack {{paper is}} made from {{softwood}} by the kraft process. The long fibers provides the paper its strength and is added wet strength chemicals to even further improve the strength. Both white and brown grades are made. Sack paper is then produced on a paper machine from the wood pulp. The paper is microcrepped to give porosity and elasticity. Microcrepping is done by drying with loose draws allowing it to shrink. This is causing the paper to elongate 4% in machine direction and 10% in cross direction before busting. Machine direction elongation can be further improved by pressing between very elastic cylinders causing more microcrepping. The paper may be coated with polyethylene (PE) to ensure an effective barrier against moisture, grease and bacteria. A <b>paper</b> <b>sack</b> can be made of several layers of sack paper depending on the toughness needed.|$|E
50|$|Ghulam Muhammad Adamjee Fecto, the Founder and Chairman of FECTO Group of Industries {{was born}} in 1926 at Jetpur, in the Indian state of Gujarat, into a Memon family. In Mumbai he started {{business}} from a small shoe shop. The shop is still there with the same name of Coronation Footwear at Grand Road. He migrated from Mumbai to Dhaka in former East Pakistan and started a trading business dealing in electrical goods and home appliances, Radios and TVs, Wire & Cable and Automobiles. Shortly afterwards, the business entered {{a joint venture with}} Japan to manufacture Toshiba radio sets. The company was a pioneer in setting up technical collaboration with Japan. The business soon expanded and industrial activities commenced in the western wing of Pakistan, where he secured the agency of tractors. In fact, the Group’s pace of development was so fast that it soon flowered into two Sugar Mills, a Tractor Plant, Cement Plant, two <b>Paper</b> <b>Sack</b> Units, Particle and MDF Board Plant.|$|E

50|$|The {{source of}} the {{contamination}} is revealed as the film draws to its close. In the Farm Bureau Services mill near Battle Creek, Michigan, the proteins that are added to animal feed, and the chemicals (PBB) used in fire retardant, are being stored in identical coloured <b>paper</b> <b>sacks,</b> on pallets placed side by side.

40|$|Still the {{metering}} of glue in {{a machine}} of bottom glueing of <b>paper</b> <b>sacks</b> is a technical problem not yet solved satisfactory. The usually applied manual control of glue metering by the operators {{often results in}} an overdosing. This leads {{to a loss of}} mechanical strength and microbial stability of the sacks, caused by high humidity. An automatic control of glue metering can only be achived, when appropriate, i. e. powerful and cost efficient sensors are available. One of the measuring principles which are adaptable to the measurement of glue application is microwave absorption measurement. Industrial microwave sensors already on the market, are far too expensive for the use in machines for the bottom glueing of <b>paper</b> <b>sacks</b> where up to 16 positions are to be equipped with a measurement system. For {{the last couple of years}} cheap microwave sources and detectors for the use in mass products have been available. With these components it should be possible to construct a sensor at very low cost s. Therefore the suitability of these microwave components for the measurement of glue application has been investigated and a sensor prototype for online measurement in a machine of bottom glueing has been developed...|$|R
