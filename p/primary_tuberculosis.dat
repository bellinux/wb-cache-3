He graduated with a BSc in Zoology from Sir John Cass College, London in 1965 and then began his 50 year career in eye research starting at the Institute of Ophthalmology. In 1968 he was awarded a PhD (Medicine anatomy) from the University of London for a thesis entitled “Laser-induced damage in the retina”.

The aim of this work was to compare the CT findings of <b>primary</b> multidrug-resistant <b>tuberculosis</b> and drug-sensitive tuberculosis in non-AIDS adults. From January 2012 to February 2016, 89 patients with <b>primary</b> multidrug-resistant <b>tuberculosis</b> were retrospectively reviewed, and 89 consecutive drug sensitive TB patients with no history of anti-tuberculous chemotherapy from January 2014 to November 2014 were enrolled as control group. All patients were seronegative for HIV. The patients' demographic data and the locations, frequency and patterns of lung lesions on chest CT were compared. Gender and frequency of diabetes were similar between the two groups. The mean age of <b>primary</b> multidrug-resistant <b>tuberculosis</b> patients was younger than that of drug-sensitive tuberculosis (39. 0 vs 47. 5, P = 0. 005). Lung cavitary nodules or masses were more frequently observed and also showed greater extent in <b>primary</b> multidrug-resistant <b>tuberculosis</b> compared with drug-sensitive tuberculosis. The extent of bronchiectasis was significantly greater in <b>primary</b> multidrug-resistant <b>tuberculosis</b> than in drug-sensitive tuberculosis.

40|$|Background: <b>Primary</b> sinonasal <b>tuberculosis</b> is an {{extremely}} rare clinical entity. Often the clinician fail to diagnose the <b>primary</b> sinonasal <b>tuberculosis,</b> so treatment is frequently delayed and leading to complications. Objective: To evaluate the clinical profile, diagnostic tools, treatment and outcome of <b>primary</b> sinonasal <b>tuberculosis.</b> Materials and Methods: Retrospective studies of six cases of <b>primary</b> sinonasal <b>tuberculosis</b> were done over period of five years. The detail clinical profile, diagnosis, treatment and outcome were studied in these patients. Results: Out of the six cases of <b>primary</b> sinonasal <b>tuberculosis,</b> four cases were female and two were male. The mean age {{during the time of}} diagnosis was 35  years (16 – 67  years). The most common clinical presentations were chronic nasal obstruction, epistaxis and ulcerations at the nasal vestibule and nasal cavity. Diagnosis was confirmed by Histopathological diagnosis in all six cases. All cases received antitubercular therapy for 6 – 9  months. All six patients successfully responded to antitubercular therapy. Two year follow up showed no relapse, dissemination and death. Conclusion: <b>Primary</b> sinonasal <b>tuberculosis</b> is a rare clinical entity.

50|$|In {{countries}} where cow milk infected with Mycobacterium bovis has been eliminated (due to culling of infected cows and pasteurization), <b>primary</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> is usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis {{and almost always}} begins in the lungs. Typically, the inhaled bacilli implant in the distal airspaces of {{the lower part of}} the upper lobe or the upper part of the lower lobe, usually close to the pleura. As sensitization develops, a 1- to 1.5-cm area of gray-white inflammation with consolidation emerges, known as the Ghon focus. In most cases, the center of this focus undergoes caseous necrosis. Tubercle bacilli, either free or within phagocytes, drain to the regional nodes, which also often caseate. This combination of parenchymal lung lesion and nodal involvement is referred to as the Ghon complex. During the first few weeks there is also lymphatic and hematogenous dissemination to other parts of the body.|$|E

The tuberculosis infected to the under 5 -years old-children namely <b>primary</b> <b>tuberculosis,</b> could decrease the children’s immunity eventually causes death, which were 100. 000 death rate 75 % are children’s. Conditions of children’s health were deeply depending on {{the quality and quantity of}} their food consumption. An adequate consumption is needed to increase their nutrition status. To improve the maternal behavior of children’s food consumption, it is necessary to give nutritional education. Objective: The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of nutritional education on the food consumption and nutrition status of the under 5 -years old-children that infected by <b>primary</b> <b>tuberculosis.</b> Methods: The research was an experimental research using randomized controlled trial method. The subject was 1 to 5 - year(s) old-children those who infected by <b>primary</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> at Unit Rawat Jalan RSUP Dokter Kariadi Semarang. Two groups chosen by randomized got different treatments, i. e. availability and unavailability of nutritional education. Each group was asked to come to Poliklinik Paru Anak every two-week for two months (4 times). The food consumption data was collected by multiple recalls before treatment and after research. The nutrition status was determined by weight per age and weight per height of Z- Score WHO NCHS. Results: The result of this study showed that after the nutritional education issued, the energy consumption average of children has increase 18. 18 % from necessity and the protein consumption average of children has increase 21. 39 % from necessity. There was a significant effect of nutritional education on increasing protein consumption of under 5 -years old-children that was infected by <b>primary</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> (p< 0. 05).

PRESENTATION OF CASEA 28 -year-old Asian male presented to casualty with a 1 -week history of epigastric cramping abdominal pain and several episodes of non-bilious vomiting. The patient deteriorated clinically, becoming more cachectic and given his unexplained weight loss, an oesophageal-gastro-duodenal endoscopic imaging confirmed a duodenal ulcer. The biopsy of the non-healing ulcer was the hallmark of the disease, revealing evidence of granulomatous inflammation consistent with tuberculosis bacilli. DISCUSSIONGastrointestinal tuberculosis with ulceration is rare with respect to the oesophagus, stomach and duodenum. This case proves to be unique, as our patient had experienced <b>primary</b> isolated gastric <b>tuberculosis</b> in the absence of pulmonary tuberculosis in a healthy individual. Immunohistochemical staining, histopathology and radiological investigations have demonstrated their importance in confirming abdominal tuberculosis and the extent of bowel involvement.
