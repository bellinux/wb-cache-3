5|$|At {{the same}} time, in {{accordance}} with the <b>political</b> <b>strategy,</b> Minh's junta was reluctant to carry out large-scale offensives, which concerned the Americans, particularly Harkins, Taylor and CIA chief John McCone. While Harkins and Taylor had opposed Diệm's ouster, the junta's policies also disappointed many supporters of the anti-Diệm coup as they saw regime change as necessary to their hopes of a more aggressive anti-communist war. For their part, Minh's leadership group believed that a more low-key military approach was needed for their political campaign against the insurgency.|$|E

He argues that once these ideas are properly understood, they can ground an idea of human sympathy for nonhuman animals, which is just one part of a caring and sustainable Anthropocene.

40|$|This {{article has}} two aims: First, {{to present a}} {{descriptive}} analysis of the recent pension reforms in Germany, focussing on the reforms of 2003 and 2004 and on the political process instead of policy outcomes. Second, this article analyzes <b>political</b> <b>strategies</b> used by the red-green government (and its predecessors) in pursuing its pension reform agenda. In contrast to a majority position in the relevant literature, which claims a broad consensus is a precondition for successful pension reform, I will argue that in Germany, a large variety of <b>political</b> <b>strategies</b> have been applied. Most involve consensus or at least an attempt to create cooperation with trade unions or the opposition parties, but some also rely on unilateral governmental action. The article discusses advantages, disadvantages, benefits, costs and preconditions of the <b>political</b> <b>strategies</b> observed in Germany. It concludes with the remark that {{the complexity of the}} German polity with its high density of veto points goes along with a large variety of <b>political</b> <b>strategies</b> {{that can be used to}} circumnavigate veto positions...|$|R

I compare the <b>political</b> <b>strategies</b> employed by the leadership of three historically known polities (the Mohegans, Pequots, and Narragansetts).

5|$|Along {{with the}} book {{mentioned}} above, in 1908 Leo Tolstoy wrote A Letter to a Hindu, which said that only by using love as a weapon through passive resistance could the Indian people overthrow colonial rule. In 1909, Gandhi wrote to Tolstoy seeking advice and permission to republish A Letter to a Hindu in Gujarati. Tolstoy responded and the two continued a correspondence until Tolstoy's death in 1910 (Tolstoy's last letter was to Gandhi). The letters concern practical and theological applications of nonviolence. Gandhi saw himself a disciple of Tolstoy, for they agreed regarding opposition to state authority and colonialism; both hated violence and preached non-resistance. However, they differed sharply on <b>political</b> <b>strategy.</b> Gandhi called for political involvement; he was a nationalist and was prepared to use nonviolent force. He was also willing to compromise. It was at Tolstoy Farm where Gandhi and Hermann Kallenbach systematically trained their disciples {{in the philosophy of}} nonviolence.|$|E

40|$|Has the {{construction}} of a European level playing field in terms of policy solutions in the merger control field led to a de facto standardisation of European corporate modes of representation? This study challenges scholars who have predicted the development of a European mode of representation that would accompany the shift of competences from the national to the European level of governance. Following the establishment of a generic framework of design of corporate <b>political</b> <b>strategies</b> – based on the management literature – and adapted to the European merger control regime context, French and British firms’ corporate <b>political</b> <b>strategies</b> are thoroughly analysed. The comparison refines the original analytical framework. Moreover the conclusions of the comparative study show differences in corporate <b>political</b> <b>strategies</b> along national lines, although a certain degree of convergence can be identified. There are traditional tendencies in choosing strategies – although the efficiency of strategies can be assessed case-by-case. These conclusions are, in turn, analysed in terms of Europeanization. The latter concept is defined as a horizontal and vertical process related to the existence of the European level of governance. Unlike current conclusions of the Europeanization literature this research project highlights five main themes of differences between French and British corporate <b>political</b> <b>strategies.</b> In light of these themes {{the extent to which the}} Europeanization process affects interest intermediation needs to be qualified. Both the horizontal and vertical flows have an impact on corporate political activity. However, this impact should not be over stated.

5|$|Aside from non-military {{problems}} facing the junta, it also came into conflict with the Americans over <b>political</b> <b>strategy,</b> most notably as to whether armed force or politics should {{be the focus of}} efforts to end the communist threat to South Vietnam. Minh, the leading generals and Tho, favored a politically oriented solution, feeling that the deposal of Diệm and Nhu had created new possibilities for ending the insurgency of the National Liberation Front, or Viet Cong, mainly through an outreach program. They thought that military force would not be sufficient for Saigon, and that political means were more effective than using American firepower in making up for this. To the junta leaders, the rapid growth of the insurgency in Diệm's final year was due to it being seen as a rallying point and symbol of opposition to Diệm and Nhu, rather than an endorsement of the communists. The senior junta generals believed that with the Ngô brothers dead, the insurgency was now without its major focus of opposition, and therefore, motivation to operate in a vigorous way. To them, most of the insurgents were non-communist, with heavy elements of Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo religious sects or other opposition that had joined because of passionate anti-Diệm sentiment. Minh thus saw the post-Diệm period as an opportunity for grassroots political strengthening to undercut the NLF support base and force the remainder to integrate into mainstream society due to political realities.|$|E
5|$|From Raqqa, Ibn Ra'iq's troops swiftly {{took over}} the districts of {{northern}} Syria, where al-Ikhshid's brother Ubayd Allah was governor, while the Egyptian forces retreated south. By October or November, Ibn Ra'iq's men had reached Ramla and moved on into the Sinai. Al-Ikhshid led his army against Ibn Ra'iq, but after a short clash at al-Farama, the two men came to an understanding, dividing Syria between them: the areas from Ramla to the south would be under al-Ikhshid, and the areas to the north under Ibn Ra'iq. In May or June 940, however, al-Ikhshid learned that Ibn Ra'iq had once again moved against Ramla. Once more, the Egyptian ruler led his army to battle. Although defeated at al-Arish, al-Ikhshid was able to quickly rally his troops and ambush Ibn Ra'iq, preventing him from entering Egypt proper and forcing him to retreat back to Damascus. Al-Ikhshid sent his brother, Abu Nasr al-Husayn, with another army against Ibn Ra'iq, but he was defeated and killed at Lajjun. Despite his victory, Ibn Ra'iq opted for peace: he gave Abu Nasr an honourable burial and sent his son, Muzahim, as envoy to Egypt. True to his <b>political</b> <b>strategy,</b> al-Ikhshid accepted. The agreement saw {{the restoration of the}} territorial status quo of the previous year, but with al-Ikhshid paying an annual tribute of 140,000 gold dinars. The deal was cemented by the marriage of Muzahim with al-Ikhshid's daughter Fatima.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner's health {{first became}} {{a topic of}} public concern in 2005 when Noticias {{magazine}} reported that she might suffer from bipolar disorder. Journalist Franco Lindner interviewed the psychiatrist who treated her without revealing his name. Journalist Nelson Castro investigated further and discovered that the psychiatrist was Alejandro Lagomarsino, who died in 2011. Lagomarsino was the leading specialist {{in the treatment of}} bipolar disorder in Argentina. Castro's investigation revealed that Kirchner was treated by Lagomarsino for a short period. He could not determine the length of her treatment or the medicine she received, or whether another psychiatrist continued treating her or not. Castro considers that some of her outlandish phrases or projects, and her frequent periods of hiding from public view, may be explained by the disorder's periods of mania and depression, as well as being a regular <b>political</b> <b>strategy.</b> Eduardo Duhalde said that Néstor Kirchner once confided in him that she had a bipolar disorder, while she was having a violent outburst. During the United States diplomatic cables leak it was revealed that Hillary Clinton questioned Kirchner's mental health and asked the US embassy whether she was receiving treatment or not; she later apologized to Kirchner for those leaks. Kirchner said in her book La Presidenta that it was all a misunderstanding; it is her sister who suffers from bipolar disorder.|$|E
