25|$|The Nazis were, however, {{interested}} in furthering sport, especially football, as {{success in the}} sport served their propaganda efforts. Hans von Tschammer und Osten specifically ordered that players from former workers' sports movements be integrated in the Nazi-approved clubs, as the Nazis {{could not afford to}} lose the country's best players.

25|$|In {{order to}} give all {{employees}} the same access to decision-making, the basic organisations of associated labor were also applied to public services, including health and education. The basic organizations were usually made up {{of no more than}} a few dozen people and had their own workers' councils, whose assent was needed for strategic decisions and appointment of managers in enterprises or public institutions. The results of these reforms however were not satisfactory. There have been rampant wage-price inflations, substantial rundown of capital plant and consumer shortages, while the income gap between the poorer southern and the relatively affluent northern regions was unchanged. The self-management system stimulated the inflationary economy that was needed to support it. Large state-owned enterprises operated as monopolists with unrestricted access to capital that was shared according to <b>political</b> <b>criteria.</b> Oil crisis of 1973 magnified the economic problems, which the government tried to solve with extensive foreign borrowing. Although such actions resulted in a reasonable rate of growth for a few years (GNP grew at 5.1% yearly), such growth was unsustainable since the rate of foreign borrowing grew at an annual rate of 20%.|$|E

40|$|Besides {{analyzing}} capitalist societies {{historically and}} think {{them in terms}} of phases or stages, we may compare different models or varieties of capitalism. In this work I make a survey of the literature on this subject, distinguish the classification that have a production or business approach to the ones that use mainly a <b>political</b> <b>criterion.</b> And present my own view on the matter that views five forms of capitalism. Among the rich countries, I see the “liberal-democratic or Anglo-Saxon model, the social or European model, and endogenous social integration or Japanese model; among developing countries, I distinguish the Asian developmental model from the liberal-dependent model that characterizes most other developing countries including Brazil. ...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the recent}} changes in the Czech Republic’s pension system was {{provoked}} by a petition to the Constitutional Court. The setting of bend points for determining the amount of pensions depending on the insured person’s previous earnings was contested as discrimination against higher income categories. The Constitutional Court granted the petition. The result was an approval and implementation of an amendment to Act No. 155 / 1995 Coll., on Pension Insurance, that {{for the purposes of}} calculating the level of old-age pensions favoured the highest income decile at the expense of most other insured persons, namely those with middle incomes. Simultaneously, the <b>political</b> <b>criterion</b> of fiscal discipline was applied to ensure the financial sustainability of the pension system. In analysing this case, we critically adopt the theory of actor-centred institutionalism and the theory of the policy cycle. From the nature of the analysed case it follows that we pay attention mainly to the legislative process which resulted in the amendment. Our methodology is dominated by analysis of documents (legal norms, court decisions, political programmes, official publications) and political and administrative communication (including debates on legislative drafts in the executive and legislature) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{empirical}} PhD research about political theory {{from the past}} and its adaptation in today’s politics. The National identity is evaluated with Benedict Anderson’s “imagined Communities” approach to the Republic of Turkey as a case study in the whole thesis. The PhD thesis consists of two main sections and two main issues for Turkey’s accession to the European Union. In one section is Turkey’s permanent data which expresses the Turkish national identity, such as the geography, demography, language, ethnic composition and religion. The permanent data describes the unchangeable data for Turkey and it is the religion that is the informally important criterion for Turkey’s accession to the European Union. In another section is Turkey’s alterable data which expresses the Turkish national identity, such as the governmental and administrative ideologies like the guardian identity of the military regime in Turkey. The alterable data describes the changeable data for Turkey which is the formally important <b>political</b> <b>criterion</b> for the accession to the European Union. Both sections are closely related to the movements of political parties in Turkey to understand which identifiable data explicitly affected Turkey’s bid for EU membership. The history of the Turks and the Republic of Turkey, the Turkish administration and the relationship between Turkey and the European Union are the determining factors in deciding which data plays a role in Turkey’s accession to the European Union, either the permanent data or the alterable data, and what role the data plays. Primary research carried out in Brussels with very high level selected elite staff provides the argument in this thesis...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} question {{in this study}} is assessing the conditions for policy change regarding the abortion legislation in Chile. This was executed by conducting semi-structured interviews, with informants of a broad range of knowledge, and collecting written sources, with a particular focus on the abortion legislation in Chile, through a two-month minor field study in Chile, funded by Sida, in 2015. For this study, an analytical framework was created by combining Kingdon’s theory of Policy Window and Htun’s research regarding gender policy change in Latin America; the problem recognition-, the policy advocacy-, the social support- and the <b>political</b> support <b>criterion.</b> The analytical framework was used to examine the conditions for Michelle Bachelet’s policy proposal from January of 2015, which would decriminalize abortion in three instances; (1) when the women’s life was at risk, (2) when a fetus would not be viable outside the womb and, (3) in the case of rape. The study showed that the conditions are favorable for a policy change in the problem recognition-, the policy advocacy- and the social support criterion. The favorable conditions are due to the issue of abortion in all three instances, being perceived as recognized by both the public and the political elite; the issue having a strong public support and a unified and strong issue network promoting a legislative change. The main difference between the conditions of the three policy proposals could be found in the <b>political</b> support <b>criterion,</b> where the issue of abortion {{in the case of a}} non-viable fetus or rape could possibly not pass, as a consequence of a fragmentation within the government and the decreasing public support for the Bachelet administration. ...|$|R
