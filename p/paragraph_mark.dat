The first is based on the presence of a <b>paragraph</b> <b>mark</b> and employs the odds ratio to identify the best markers. The second takes into account lexical cohesion between sentences via an index resulting from latent semantic analysis. These two indices were applied mainly to the study of temporal adverbial expressions in literary texts.

When the structure of the text is not available (justified text), the encoding strategy was rather temporal, text coherence would be established progressively during reading.

30|$|In {{the three}} scans in Fig. 5 a {{transition}} from a superficial picture to a more in-depth picture is visible. The calcium map shows only the front side of the fragment, because the fluorescence lines of calcium are relatively weak [3.691 keV (K_ 1) and 4.012 keV (K_ 1)]. This means that the fluorescence of calcium in depth is too weak to penetrate the surrounding parchment. Iron fluorescence, however, has higher energy [6.403 keV (K_ 1) and 7.057 keV (K_ 1)] and therefore is able to penetrate more layers of parchment. This results in overlap of text from the front and the backside (recto and verso) of the fragment, which decreases the readability of the text. In theory the backside of the fragment could be retrieved {{by a series of}} steps including the creation of a binary mask and subtraction. This problem has been encountered before and image processing techniques such as the pseudo-color technique were employed to enhance readability, but this is outside {{the scope of this article}} [15]. Even more penetrating than iron is the much heavier mercury [9.987 keV (L_ 1) and 11.823 keV (L_ 1)]. This is the reason why the mercury distribution map reveals more layers that are hidden inside this book cover. Multiple <b>paragraph</b> <b>marks</b> are visible that seem randomly distributed across the fragment, because they correspond to different layers. We also see some words that are rotated 90 ° relative to the word “decollatio”. In short, looking at fluorescence lines with increasing energy provides us with an in-depth profile of the fragment.|$|R

6000|$|I shall now {{mention a}} {{particular}} wherein {{your whole body}} will be certainly against me, and the laity almost to a man on my side. However it came about, I cannot get over the prejudice of taking some little offence at the clergy for perpetually reading their sermons[6]; perhaps my frequent hearing of foreigners, who never made use of notes, may have added to my disgust. And I cannot but think, that whatever is read, differs as much from what is repeated without book, as a copy does from an original. At the same time, I am highly sensible what an extreme difficulty it would be upon you to alter this method, and that, in such a case, your sermons would be much less valuable than they are, for want of time to improve and correct them. I would therefore gladly come to a compromise with you in this matter. I knew a clergyman of some distinction, who appeared to deliver his sermon without looking into his notes, which when I complimented him upon, he assured me he could not repeat six lines; but his method was to write the whole sermon in a large plain hand, with all the forms of margin, <b>paragraph,</b> <b>marked</b> page, and the like; then on Sunday morning he took care to run it over five or six times, which he could do in an hour; and when he deliver'd it, by pretending to turn his face {{from one side to}} the other, he would (in his own expression) pick up the lines, and cheat his people by making them believe he had it all by heart. He farther added, that whenever he happened by neglect to omit any of these circumstances, the vogue of the parish was, [...] "Our doctor gave us but an indifferent sermon to-day." [...] Now among us, many clergymen act too directly contrary to this method, that from a habit of saving time and paper, which they acquired at the University, they write in so diminutive a manner, with such frequent blots and interlineations, that they are hardly able to go on without perpetual hesitations or extemporary expletives: And I desire to know what can be more inexcusable, than to see a divine and a scholar, at a loss in reading his own compositions, which it is supposed he has been preparing with much pains and thought for the instruction of his people? The want of a little more care in this article, is the cause of much ungraceful behaviour. You will observe some clergymen with their heads held down from the beginning to the end, within an inch of the cushion, to read what is hardly legible; which, besides the untoward manner, hinders them from making the best advantage of their voice: others again have a trick of popping up and down every moment from their paper to the audience, like an idle school-boy on a repetition day.|$|R
40|$|The article {{presented}} {{focuses on}} a linguistic unit rarely studied by authors: the paragraph. This is a solid reason to make us contribute to cast light on this matter, {{and that is the}} cause for the research we are informing on these pages. It starts with the inventory of definitions that, about this unit, some linguists propose, as well as those collected in linguistic dictionaries, current Spanish and other language dictionaries, and also far-off time Spanish dictionaries. As a result of these consultations, we may conclude that, except for the linguists' proposals, there is no accuracy in the presented definitions, which are based on merely formal aspects. The problem the previous statement brings is that the marks that today help to identify the different paragraphs of a text have not always existed, as the oíd manuscripts display its writing in compact blocks. Nevertheless, it is not acceptable the view of the paragraph as a modern invention, since there is a reach repertoire of arguments which support the idea that the paragraph is a linguistic unit whith a psychological correlate. It seems as if in oíd language the <b>paragraphs</b> were <b>marked</b> by linguistic rather than graphic devices, and this leads to a less noticeable división into paragraphs than in our days. Our article finishes with the defense of a hypothesis according to which the present procedures about the <b>marking</b> of the <b>paragraphs</b> would have been born to make the changes of the paragraph more visible and, on this way, avoid making a greater effort to decode and interpret texts...|$|R
40|$|Papuan speech {{communities}} in New Guinea share {{a number of}} specific discourse preferences {{that are used in}} similar ways in certain genres. This article focuses on three discourse practices as they operate in narrative texts; thematization (a strong preference for Theme, Predication or Left Dislocation constructions), distribution (a strong preference to distribute nominals over series of clauses and of modifiers over series of phrases) and recapitulative linkage (connecting clause chains or sentences by tail-head linkage). Thematization occurs especially in discourse initial paragraphs when the time, place, participant and main themes are introduced, and in discourse final paragraphs with summarizing and concluding functions. Thematization combines with non-distributive forms in these contexts to form discourse units in which the number and complexity of nominal phrases is relatively high. Such thematic parts are not organized around progression of events and recapitulative linkage is hardly present. Once the story is underway, distributive tendencies become more dominant, with unmarked, chained forms of recapitulative linkage connecting the often lengthy and 'verby' sentences into chaining <b>paragraphs.</b> When <b>marked,</b> thematized recapitulative linkage occurs, this signals thematic discontinuity. Many aspects of the typology of Papuan languages, from demonstrative topic markers to experiential, subordinate and perception complement constructions, can be understood from the perspective of these areal discourse preferences of Papuan speakers. But the identification of these areal pragmatic patterns not only enhances our understanding of the specific nature of Papuan languages, it also has crucial methodological implications for the way field linguists transcribe and analyse whole texts or single expressions from these languages. Ignoring these discourse practices may lead to serious distortions in the transcription and collection of data and in the grammatical description of these languages. © 2005 Elsevier B. V.
