50|$|Aminosteroids are a {{group of}} steroids with a similar {{structure}} based on an amino-substituted steroid nucleus. They are neuromuscular blocking agents, acting as competitive antagonists of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), and block the signaling of acetylcholine in the nervous system. These drugs include candocuronium iodide (chandonium iodide), dacuronium bromide, dihydrochandonium, dipyrandium, malouetine, pancuronium bromide, <b>pipecuronium</b> <b>bromide,</b> rapacuronium bromide, rocuronium bromide, stercuronium iodide, and vecuronium bromide.|$|E
40|$|Steroidal {{quaternary}} ammonium compounds 12 and 13 with quaternised nitrogen at positions 3 and 16 of the steroidal nucleus in androstane series were synthesised and their neuromuscular blocking activities and ganglion blocking activities were studied using chick biventer and anaesthetised cat as the models. The bisquaternary compounds 12 and 13 {{have been found}} to be greater in potency than d-tubocurarine. Acetoxy derivative 13 has been found to be more potent than <b>pipecuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> taking d-tubocurarine as the standard compound indicating the need of acetoxy function at position 16...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pipecuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> {{is a new}} {{long acting}} neuromuscluar {{blocking}} drug reportedly devoid of cardiovascular side effects. It is a steroidal molecule similar in structure to pancuronium and has a potency 20 % greater [1]. Its duration of action is 1. 2 - 2. 1 times longer than that of pancuronium [2]. Clinical studies suggest that this agent has no significant cardiovascular effects [3, 4], {{although there have been}} occasional reports of mild bradycardia [5, 6]. The present study was undertaken to examine the in vitro inotropic and chronotropic effects of pipecuronium using isolated rabbit heart preparations...|$|E
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To {{measure the}} {{interaction}} of two antibiotics (clindamycin and colistin) on neuromuscular blockade induced by <b>pipecuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> (a new long-acting, steroidal, nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug). DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: Inpatient gynecologic and gastroenterologic service at a university medical center. PATIENTS: Three groups of 20 ASA physical status I and II patients with normal kidney and liver function, taking no medication, and undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia. INTERVENTIONS: Anesthesia was induced with propofol and alfentanil intravenously (IV) and maintained with a propofol infusion and 60 % nitrous oxide in oxygen. <b>Pipecuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> 50 micrograms/kg was administered after reaching a stable baseline of single-twitch response. At 25 % recovery of pipecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade, patients received one of two antibiotics, clindamycin 300 mg or colistin 1 million IU, or a placebo. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The recovery index (RI, defined as time from 25 % to 75 % recovery of neuromuscular blockade) was measured using the single-twitch response of the adductor pollicis muscle with supramaximal stimulation of the ulnar nerve at the wrist. RI after administration of an antibiotic (given at 25 % recovery) was measured and compared with RI of the control group using Student's unpaired t-test. Statistical analyses of the results showed a significant prolongation of the recovery time (from 25 % to 75 % recovery) of 40 minutes for colistin. CONCLUSIONS: When this type of antibiotic is used during anesthesia with pipercuronium as a muscle relaxant, one {{must be aware of}} a significant prolongation of an already long-acting neuromuscular blockade and (although not observed in this study) possible problems in antagonism. status: publishe...|$|E
