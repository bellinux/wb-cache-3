25|$|Porous paving (or {{pervious}} paving) is {{an alternative}} to conventional impermeable pavement and allows infiltration of runoff water to the soil or to a dedicated water storage reservoir below it In reasonably flat areas such as car parks, driveways and lightly used roads, it decreases the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff and can improve water quality by removing contaminants through filtering, interception and biological treatment. Porous pavements can have several forms and are either monolithic or modular. Monolithic structures consist of a single continuous porous medium such as porous concrete or porous pavement (asphalt) while modular structures include porous pavers individual paving blocks that are constructed {{so that there is}} a gap in between each <b>paver.</b> Commercial products that are available are for example, pavements made from special asphalt or concrete containing minimal materials, concrete grid pavements, and concrete ceramic or plastic modular pavements. Porous pavements are usually laid on a very porous material (sand or gravel), underlain by a layer of geotextile material. Maintenance activities vary {{depending on the type of}} porous pavement. Generally, inspections and removal of sediment and debris should be undertaken. Modulate pavers can also be lifted, backwashed and replaced when blockages occurs. Generally porous pavement is not suited for areas with heavy traffic loads. Particulates in stormwater can clog pores in the material.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the differences in the number of paving stones laid (productivity), task demands, energetic workload, body region discomfort and preference when laying paving stones with or without use of a <b>paver's</b> trolley (n = 8) in a within-subject controlled study of <b>pavers.</b> The number of paving stones laid and the task demands were measured by means of systematic observations at the workplace. The energetic workload was determined using the percentage of heart rate reserve (%HRR). Body region discomfort was measured using visual analog scales, and the workers' preference was ascertained via interview. The use of a <b>paver's</b> trolley had no effect on productivity, %HRR or body region discomfort compared to working without a <b>paver's</b> trolley. The duration of knee-straining activities did not differ between working with (141 min) and without (146 min) the <b>paver's</b> trolley. However, six of the eight <b>pavers</b> indicated that, given suitable circumstances, they wanted to use the <b>paver's</b> trolley. Relevance to industry: To reduce the chance of work-related low back and knee complaints among <b>pavers,</b> the duration, frequency and intensity of lower back and knee-straining activities should be limited by means of technical measures such as mechanical paving. The <b>paver's</b> trolley does not appear to reduce knee-straining activities and therefore does not appear useful in reducing the risk of knee complaints and disorders. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

60|$|Some {{have been}} puzzled {{to tell how}} the shore became so {{regularly}} paved. My townsmen have all heard the tradition--the oldest people {{tell me that they}} heard it in their youth--that anciently the Indians were holding a pow-wow upon a hill here, which rose as high into the heavens as the pond now sinks deep into the earth, and they used much profanity, as the story goes, though this vice is one of which the Indians were never guilty, and while they were thus engaged the hill shook and suddenly sank, and only one old squaw, named Walden, escaped, and from her the pond was named. It has been conjectured that when the hill shook these stones rolled down its side and became the present shore. It is very certain, at any rate, that once there was no pond here, and now there is one; and this Indian fable does not in any respect conflict with the account of that ancient settler whom I have mentioned, who remembers so well when he first came here with his divining-rod, saw a thin vapor rising from the sward, and the hazel pointed steadily downward, and he concluded to dig a well here. As for the stones, many still think that they are hardly to be accounted for by the action of the waves on these hills; but I observe that the surrounding hills are remarkably full of the same kind of stones, so that they have been obliged to pile them up in walls {{on both sides of the}} railroad cut nearest the pond; and, moreover, there are most stones where the shore is most abrupt; so that, unfortunately, it is no longer a mystery to me. I detect the <b>paver.</b> If the name was not derived from that of some English locality--Saffron Walden, for instance--one might suppose that it was called originally Walled-in Pond.|$|E
