25|$|Though non-parametric, L-estimators are {{frequently}} used for <b>parameter</b> <b>estimation,</b> {{as indicated by}} the name, though they must often be adjusted to yield an unbiased consistent estimator.

40|$|International audienceJoint {{estimation}} {{of states and}} parameters in state-space systems is usually realized with adaptive observers. For continuous time state-space systems, adaptive observers are generally {{in the form of}} ordinary differential equations. The implementation of such an adaptive observer requires the simultaneous solution of the differential equations for both state and <b>parameter</b> <b>estimations.</b> This chapter presents an alternative approach which decomposes state and <b>parameter</b> <b>estimations</b> in several steps. Each algorithm designed with this approach is also a system of ordinary differential equations, but with the particularity of being block-triangular so that state and <b>parameter</b> <b>estimations</b> are decoupled. The resulting stepwise solution is numerically more efficient. This new approach is applicable to multiple-input multiple-output linear time varying systems...|$|R
25|$|Statistical theory studies {{decision}} {{problems such}} as minimizing the risk (expected loss) of a statistical action, such as using a procedure in, for example, <b>parameter</b> <b>estimation,</b> hypothesis testing, and selecting the best. In these traditional areas of mathematical statistics, a statistical-decision problem is formulated by minimizing an objective function, like expected loss or cost, under specific constraints: For example, designing a survey often involves minimizing the cost of estimating a population mean with a given level of confidence. Because of its use of optimization, the mathematical theory of statistics shares concerns with other decision sciences, such as operations research, control theory, and mathematical economics.|$|E
25|$|Besides <b>parameter</b> <b>estimation,</b> the ABC-framework {{can be used}} {{to compute}} the {{posterior}} probabilities of different candidate models. In such applications, one possibility is to use the rejection-sampling in a hierarchical manner. First, a model is sampled from the prior distribution for the models; then, given the model sampled, the model parameters are sampled from the prior distribution assigned to that model. Finally, a simulation is performed as in the single-model ABC. The relative acceptance frequencies for the different models now approximate the posterior distribution for these models. Again, computational improvements for ABC in the space of models have been proposed, such as constructing a particle filter in the joint space of models and parameters.|$|E
25|$|Bayesian {{inference}} is one proposed {{alternative to}} significance testing. (Nickerson cited 10 sources suggesting it, including Rozeboom (1960)). For example, Bayesian <b>parameter</b> <b>estimation</b> can provide rich {{information about the}} data from which researchers can draw inferences, while using uncertain priors that exert only minimal influence on the results when enough data is available. Psychologist John K. Kruschke has suggested Bayesian estimation as an alternative for the t-test. Alternatively two competing models/hypothesis can be compared using Bayes factors. Bayesian methods could be criticized for requiring information that is seldom available in the cases where significance testing is most heavily used. Neither the prior probabilities nor the probability distribution of the test statistic under the alternative hypothesis are often available in the social sciences.|$|E

2500|$|For {{items such}} as {{multiple}} choice items, the parameter [...] is used in attempt {{to account for the}} effects of guessing on the probability of a correct response. It indicates the probability that very low ability individuals will get this item correct by chance, mathematically represented as a lower asymptote. A four-option multiple choice item might have an IRF like the example item; there is a 1/4 chance of an extremely low ability candidate guessing the correct answer, so the [...] would be approximately 0.25. This approach assumes that all options are equally plausible, because if one option made no sense, even the lowest ability person would be able to discard it, so IRT <b>parameter</b> <b>estimation</b> methods take this into account and estimate a [...] based on the observed data.|$|E
