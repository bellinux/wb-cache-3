50|$|Plugs {{and power}} cords have a rated voltage (V) and rated current (A) {{assigned}} {{to them by}} the manufacturer, and these values are required to be marked on the plug. For a plug, the values are normally those specified in the relevant standard sheet. The international preferred rating for household plugs and sockets is either 130 V or 250 V; these are the values for normal use, and at which they are tested. (Plugs and power cords are also required to be tested at higher voltage for a brief period of 1 minute to test their electrical strength in case of fault conditions.)

5000|$|The Prescott and Cedar Mill Pentium 4 cores, {{as well as}} the Smithfield and Presler Pentium D cores, {{used the}} LGA 775 socket. In July 2006, Intel {{released}} the desktop processor Core 2 Duo (codenamed Conroe), which also uses this socket, as does the subsequent Core 2 Quad. Intel changed from Socket 478 to LGA 775 because the new <b>pin</b> <b>type</b> offers better power distribution to the processor, allowing the front-side bus to be raised to 1600 MT/s. The 'T' in Socket T was derived from the now cancelled Tejas core, which was to replace the Prescott core. Another advantage for Intel with this newer architecture is that it is now the motherboard which has the pins, rather than the CPU, transferring the risk of pins being bent from the CPU to the motherboard.The CPU is pressed into place by a [...] "load plate", rather than human fingers directly. The installer lifts the hinged [...] "load plate", inserts the processor, closes the load plate {{over the top of the}} processor, and pushes down a locking lever. The pressure of the locking lever on the load plate clamps the processor's 775 copper contact points firmly down onto the socket's 775 pins, ensuring a good connection. The load plate only covers the edges of the top surface of the CPU (integrated heat spreader). The center is free to make contact with the cooling device placed on top of the CPU. The spacing for the CPU cooler mounting holes is 72mm x 72mm.|$|E
5000|$|Socket {{wrenches}} {{are most}} commonly hexagonal, or more {{commonly referred to}} as [...] "6-point" [...] in lay terms. Sockets are driven by being attached to the driving tool via a male/female square connection fitting (called the square drive). Standard sizes of square drives around the world include 1/4", 3/8", 1/2", 3/4", 1", 1-1/2", 2-1/2" [...] and 3-1/2" [...] square drive sizes (a de facto international standard with no metric equivalents) along with some lesser used drivers such as 5/8" [...] square drive, and both #4 and #5 spline drives specified in ANSI B107 specifications. This wide range of square drive sizes provides {{for a wide variety of}} socket types and sizes to suit small to very large nuts and bolts. Some square drivers have a through hole to attach the socket to the driver (using a retaining ring with o-ring and <b>pin</b> <b>type,</b> or single piece molded retaining rings), a locking pin, or friction ball. Some common hand ratchets employ a quick release button on their top for quick socket release of smaller sockets.The tool chosen to drive the socket wrench ultimately supplies the mechanical advantage needed by the user to provide the torque needed to loosen or tighten the fastener as may be required. Larger drivers are typically used with higher torque, while smaller drivers are used for convenience in smaller low torque applications. Given the limits of human strength and fatigue, torque above 600 ft-lbs of torque will generally involve some kind of power assist, instead of the user simply pushing on the handle of a wrench. Very large sockets and drivers are typically powered by hydraulics to achieve torque.|$|E

Among different methods, the fabrication of bipolar plates from metal forming processes is the best selection. Recently, hydroforming {{is one of these}} methods that are used in fabrication of these plates. On the other hand, there are different layouts of flow fields for various usages.

40|$|We modeled the {{geometrical}} roughening of bedding-parallel, mainly layer-dominated stylolites {{in order}} to understand their structural evolution, to present an advanced classification of stylolite shapes and to relate this classification to chemical compaction and permeability variations at stylolites. Stylolites are rough dissolution seams that develop in sedimentary basins during chemical compaction. In the Zechstein 2 carbonate units, an important lean gas reservoir in the southern Permian Zechstein basin in Germany, stylolites influence local fluid flow, mineral replacement reactions and hence the permeability of the reservoir. Our simulations demonstrate that layer-dominated stylolites can grow in three distinct stages: an initial slow nucleation phase, a fast layer-pinning phase and a final freezing phase if the layer is completely dissolved during growth. Dissolution of the pinning layer and thus destruction of the stylolite's compaction tracking capabilities {{is a function of the}} background noise in the rock and the dissolution rate of the layer itself. Low background noise needs a slower dissolving layer for pinning to be successful but produces flatter teeth than higher background noise. We present an advanced classification based on our simulations and separate stylolites into four classes: (1) rectangular layer <b>type,</b> (2) seismogram <b>pinning</b> <b>type,</b> (3) suture/sharp peak type and (4) simple wave-like type. Rectangular layer type stylolites are the most appropriate for chemical compaction estimates because they grow linearly and record most of the actual compaction (up to 40 mm in the Zechstein example). Seismogram <b>pinning</b> <b>type</b> stylolites also provide good tracking capabilities, with the largest teeth tracking most of the compaction. Suture/sharp peak type stylolites grow in a non-linear fashion and thus do not record most of the actual compaction. However, when a non-linear growth law is used, the compaction estimates are similar to those making use of the rectangular layer type stylolites. Simple wave-like stylolites are not useful for compaction estimates, since their growth is highly non-linear with a very low growth exponent. In the case where sealing material is collected at the tooth during dissolution, stylolites can act as barriers for local fluid flow as they intensify sealing capabilities of pinning layers. However, the development of teeth and spikes offsets and thus destroys continuous stylolite seams so that the permeability across the stylolite becomes very heterogeneous and they are no continuous barriers. This behavior is best shown in rectangular layer and seismogram <b>pinning</b> <b>type</b> stylolites that develop efficient fluid barriers at teeth tips but destroy sealing capabilities of layers by offsetting them at the flank, leading to a permeability anisotropy along 2 -D stylolite planes. Suture/sharp peak stylolites can create fluid barriers if they collect enough sealing material. However, if the collecting material does not seal or if spikes offset the sealing material the stylolite leaks. We propose that our classification can be used to realistically estimate chemical compaction in reservoirs and gives an indication on how heterogeneous the permeability of stylolites can be...|$|R
