60|$|And {{then came}} death in life. I learned the trick, Ed Morrell taught it me, as you shall see. It began through Warden Atherton and Captain Jamie. They must have {{experienced}} a recrudescence of panic at thought of the dynamite they believed hidden. They {{came to me in}} my dark cell, and they told me plainly that they would jacket me to death if I did not confess where the dynamite was hidden. And they assured me that they would do it officially without any hurt to their own official skins. My death would appear on the <b>prison</b> <b>register</b> as due to natural causes.|$|E
6000|$|I was [...] "pinched." [...] I {{knew who}} wanted to see me. With that [...] "fly-cop" [...] and the two hoboes at my heels, and under the {{direction}} of the former, I led the way to the city jail. There we were searched and our names registered. I have forgotten, now, under which name I was registered. I gave the name of Jack Drake, but when they searched me, they found letters addressed to Jack London. This caused trouble and required explanation, all of which has passed from my mind, and to this day I do not know whether I was pinched as Jack Drake or Jack London. But one or the other, it should be there to-day in the <b>prison</b> <b>register</b> of Niagara Falls. Reference can bring it to light. The time was somewhere in the latter part of June, 1894. It was only a few days after my arrest that the great railroad strike began.|$|E

50|$|After {{his release}} in 1989, Nee was disgusted by McIntyre's murder and, {{motivated}} increasingly by Irish republicanism, {{to cut his}} links to Bulger.

60|$|On the whole, Sir Percy {{decided to}} leave the <b>prison</b> <b>registers</b> alone for the present.

40|$|This article {{demonstrates}} {{the utility of}} a new source, <b>prison</b> <b>registers,</b> {{for the history of}} literacy and education in nineteenth-century England. It focuses on two sets of <b>prison</b> <b>registers</b> from the two county gaols in Suffolk, located at Ipswich and Bury St Edmunds, which contain personal information on 16, 690 individuals over the period 1840 to 1878. First, the article examines the context in which personal information about prisoners was recorded and tests the data against benchmarks from other sources to prove its reliability. Second, the article employs two methods, statistical analysis and digital mapping, to study in depth the rich data on prisoners’ literacy and schooling. Finally, the article shows how the results of this analysis significantly revise our understanding of the prevalence of schooling among the labouring poor, the use of different types of schools, the role of the partially literate in the drive towards mass literacy, and the importance of life-long learning...|$|R

40|$|Foreign {{influence}} on South China increasingly disrupted the economy {{from the late}} eighteenth century. Many scholars believe {{the standard of living}} fell, while others point to positive gains from increased integration with the world economy. The paper estimates the secular trend in the average height of the southern Chinese in the nineteenth century based on data from <b>prison</b> <b>registers</b> in colonial Australia. Contrary to the pessimist view, height began to decline obviously only from the 1850 s, a product of the dislocation effects of revolts and rebellions.
