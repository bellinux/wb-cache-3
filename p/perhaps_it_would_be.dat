The distinction was that they were created alternately and moved in opposite directions away from a central location on the valley floor, suggesting the existence of an inaudible free convection whistle. The reason for including this type of whistle is that we tend to think that it is necessary for a forced jet flow to encounter a solid material to create a whistle. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more correct to generalize the concept to a particular impedance mismatch rather than a solid object. The Hartmann whistle and the jet screech fits into this generalization. The concept also applies to any fluid motion as opposed to a strictly forced flow.|$|E

500|$|While McKellen {{had made}} his sexual {{orientation}} known to fellow actors early on in his stage career, {{it was not until}} 1988 that he came out to the general public, in a programme on BBC Radio. The context that prompted McKellen's decision– overriding any concerns about a possible negative effect on his career– was that the controversial Section 28 of the Local Government Bill, known simply as Section 28, was then under consideration in the British Parliament. Section 28 proposed prohibiting local authorities from promoting homosexuality [...] "... as a kind of pretended family relationship". McKellen became active in fighting the proposed law, and, during a BBC Radio 3 programme where he debated Section 28 with the conservative journalist Peregrine Worsthorne, declared himself gay. McKellen has stated that he was influenced in his decision by the advice and support of his friends, among them noted gay author Armistead Maupin. In a 1998 interview that discusses the 29th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, McKellen commented, I have many regrets about not having come out earlier, but one of them might be that I didn't engage myself in the politicking. He has said of this period: My own participating in that campaign was a focus for people [...] take comfort that if Ian McKellen was on board for this, <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> all right for other people to be as well, gay and straight. Section 28 was, however, enacted and remained on the statute books until 2000 in Scotland and 2003 in England and Wales. Section 28 never applied in Northern Ireland.|$|E

2500|$|Apuleius used a Latin {{style that}} {{registered}} as elocutio novella ("new speech") to his literary contemporaries. This style expressed the every day language {{used by the}} educated, along with naturally embedded archaisms. It worked to transform the more formal, classical grammar once favored since Cicero (106–43 BC). To rhetoricians <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> asiatic as opposed to attic style. Also new speech pointed toward the future development of modern Romance languages.

2500|$|Critics of Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar differ greatly {{on their}} views of Caesar and Brutus. Many have debated whether Caesar or Brutus is the protagonist of the play, because of the title character's death in Act Three, Scene One. But Caesar compares himself to the Northern Star, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> foolish not to {{consider}} him as the axial character of the play, around whom the entire story turns. Intertwined in this debate is a smattering of philosophical and psychological ideologies on republicanism and monarchism. One author, Robert C. Reynolds, devotes attention to the names or epithets given to both Brutus and Caesar in his essay [...] "Ironic Epithet in Julius Caesar". This author points out that Casca praises Brutus at face value, but then inadvertently compares him to a disreputable joke of a man by calling him an alchemist, [...] "Oh, he sits high in all the people's hearts,/And that which would appear offence in us/ His countenance, like richest alchemy,/ Will change to virtue and to worthiness" [...] (I.iii.158-60). Reynolds also talks about Caesar and his [...] "Colossus" [...] epithet, which he points out has its obvious connotations of power and manliness, but also lesser known connotations of an outward glorious front and inward chaos.|$|E
