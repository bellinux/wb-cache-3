40|$|Background: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a seldom-reported {{pathogen}} in ocular infections. The report describes six {{cases of}} Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (<b>S.</b> maltophilia) <b>keratitis</b> and scleritis. To our knowledge, {{this is the}} foremost report of S. maltophilia scleritis. Methods: Laboratory reports of patients diagnosed with S. maltophilia ocular infec-tions were collected from the ophthalmic department of Chang-Gung memo-rial hospital from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2003. On evalua-tion of risk factors, isolates, antibiotic sensitivities, and response to the treat-ment ensued. Results: Of the 6 reported cases, 5 related bacterial keratitis and 2 scleritis. (One case reported <b>S.</b> maltophilia <b>keratitis</b> and secondary scleritis.) The primary risk factor in such cases is ocular surgery. The organism cultured was the single isolate in three cases (50 %). The susceptibility test showed that 50 %, 83 %, and 100 % of the isolates were sensitive to ceftazidime, a combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin respectively. Discussion: Ocular surface compromise such as penetrating keratoplasty was a primary risk factor of <b>S.</b> maltophilia <b>keratitis</b> in our study. The results of isolates and the antibiotic sensitivities were different from previously published results. Our cases responded well to antibiotic therapy and antibiotic therapy com-bined with conjunctival autografting. One case of <b>S.</b> maltophilia <b>keratitis</b> and secondary scleritis had a poor prognosis, arguably associated with a co-infec-tion of Mycobacteria chelonae...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) {{infection}} {{is an important}} public health issue. The study aimed to characterize the patient demographics, clinical features, antibiotic susceptibility, and clinical outcomes of <b>keratitis</b> caused by <b>S.</b> aureus, {{and to make a}} comparison between MRSA and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) isolates. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Patients (n = 59) with culture-proven <b>S.</b> aureus <b>keratitis</b> treated in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2010, were included in our study. Patients' demographic and clinical data were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-six MRSA (44 %) and 33 MSSA (56 %) isolates were collected. The MRSA keratitis was significantly more common among the patients with healthcare exposure (P = 0. 038), but 46. 2 % (12 / 26) of patients with MRSA keratitis were considered to have community-associated infections. All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin. MRSA isolates were significantly more resistant to clindamycin, erythromycin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. Ocular surface disease was a significant risk factor for MRSA keratitis (P = 0. 011). Visual outcome did not differ significantly between the MRSA and MSSA groups. However, age (B = 0. 01, P = 0. 035, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 001 - 0. 019) and visual acuity at presentation (B = 0. 749, P< 0. 001, 95 % CI: 0. 573 - 0. 926) were significantly correlated with visual outcome. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Ocular surface disease is an important predisposing factor for <b>S.</b> aureus <b>keratitis,</b> especially for MRSA infections. Advanced age and poor visual acuity at presentation are important prognostic indicators for poor visual outcome in <b>S.</b> aureus <b>keratitis.</b> Oxacillin resistance may not be a significant prognostic indicator...|$|R
40|$|A 70 -year-old {{man with}} a long history of {{diabetes}} mellitus presented to our hospital (Department of Ophthalmology, Sahm Yook Medical Center, Seoul, Korea) complaining of severe ocular pain and visual disturbance in his left eye that had started three days prior to admission. A round 3. 7 × 5. 0 mm dense central stromal infiltrate with an overlying epithelial defect was noted on slit-lamp examination. Following corneal scrapings and culture, topical 0. 5 % moxifloxacin and 0. 5 % tobramycin were administered hourly. A few days later, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was isolated in a bacterial culture from a corneal specimen. According to the results of susceptibility tests, topical 0. 5 % moxifloxacin was given every hour and 0. 5 % tobramycin was stopped. The patient's clinical features improved steadily with treatment. The corneal epithelium healed rapidly, and the infiltrate resolved within four weeks of the initiation of treatment. The patient’s best corrected visual acuity improved from hand motion to 20 / 25. Key Words: Keratitis, Moxifloxacin, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (S. maltophilia) is a nonfermentative, gram-negative bacillus that has assumed an increasingly important role as a nosocomial pathogen in immune compromised patients [1]. Treatment of S. maltophilia infections is also {{complicated by the fact that}} isolates are resistant to many broad-spectrum agents [2]. Ophthalmologic syndromes, including conjunctivitis, keratitis, dacrocystitis and pre-septal cellulitis, may be caused by S. maltophilia [3]. <b>S.</b> maltophilia <b>keratitis</b> is associated with very poor prognoses because of its resistance to many broad-spectrum antibiotics [4].

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus or &# 147;golden-staph&# 148; is {{the leading}} cause of {{hospital}} acquired infections, medical device related infections and diabetic foot ulcers. Multi-drug resistant strains and methicillin-resistant-S. aureus (MRSA) are a particular problem in hospital. Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of microbial keratitis, characterized by severe pain, blurred vision, an epithelial defect, infiltration and an anterior chamber reaction and can result in blindnes. Treatment of S. aureus corneal infections is extremely labour-intensive and usually involves the application of antibiotic drops every half-hour for 48 hours. As the prevalence of antibiotic resistance is increasing in S. aureus isolated from nosocomial and community-acquired infections such as MK the development of new therapies is paramount. The aim of this study was to identify virulence factors contribute to the pathology of <b>S.</b> aureus <b>keratitis</b> by comparing two different isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, a virulent clinical corneal ulcer isolate (Staph 38) and a less virulent laboratory strain (S. aureus 8325 - 4). Initially, we identified an increase in the expression of thirteen extracellular proteins and eight cell-associated proteins was increased 3 -fold or greater in the clinical isolate Staph 38 compared to the laboratory strain 8325 - 4. Four of these proteins were homologous to known S. aureus virulence factors; fibronectin binding protein (FnBP), staphopain, glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase A 2 and extracellular adherence protein. In addition, two putative proteins which have been tentatively identified as cell wall surface anchor protein and S. aureus surface protein G were found in abundance in Staph 38. Alterations in the expression of the four known virulence factors were confirmed by the use of binding assays to specific ligands. The clinical isolate demonstrated an increase in the ability to bind all ligands. Further investigation on these factors suggested some unique mechanisms by which S. aureus may promote its colonisation of the cornea such as the effects of staphopain on the levels of surface FnBP. While virulence factors such as GAPDH do not appear to offer useful points for therapeutic interventions and others such as SasG, Q 6 G 7 Y, Eap, FNBP and staphopain do. This knowledge has contributed to our understanding function of bacterial factors of S. aureus during corneal infection with the serious and potentially blinding S. aureus. Overall, from the results obtained in this study, several virulence factors were identified in abundance in the clinical isolate Staph 38 and their effect on the outcome of <b>S.</b> aureus <b>keratitis</b> infection was established...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} corneal ring infiltrates {{caused by}} Serratia marcescens {{in a patient}} with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV- 1) who wore contact lenses. Methods: A case study of a patient with keratitis due to an infection caused by S. marcescens and exhibiting corneal ring infiltrates was reviewed for history, clinical manifestation, microscopic study, and management. Results: A 29 -year-old man who {{had a history of}} contact lens wear and HIV- 1 infection was admitted to hospital because of blurred vision, redness, and corneal infiltrates {{in the shape of a}} ring in the left eye. The visual acuity (VA) in both eyes was hand movement (uncorrected). Corneal scrapings were performed. The culture results of the corneal specimens revealed S. marcescens. The culture results of the contact lens disclosed the same organism. The corneal ulcer responded well to treatment with topical gentamycin sulfate 14 mg/ml. The final VA remained hand movement. Conclusions: S. marcescens can cause ring infiltrates in a HIV- 1 patient who wears contact lenses. The treatment result for <b>S.</b> marcescens <b>keratitis</b> in a HIV- 1 patient who wore contact lenses was favorable after intensive use of fortified topical antibiotics...|$|R
40|$|Staphylococcus aureus {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{pathogens}} causing keratitis. Surfactant protein D (SP-D) plays a critical role in host defense and innate immunity. In order to investigate the role of SP-D in ocular S. aureus infection, the eyes of wild-type (WT) and SP-D knockout (SP-D KO) C 57 BL/ 6 mice were infected with S. aureus (10 (7) CFU/eye) in the presence and absence of cysteine protease inhibitor(E 64). Bacterial counts in the ocular surface were examined 3, 6, 12, 24 hrs after infection. Bacterial phagocytosis by neutrophils and bacterial invasion in ocular epithelial cells were evaluated quantitatively. S. aureus-induced ocular injury was determined with corneal fluorescein staining. The results demonstrated that SP-D is expressed in ocular surface epithelium and the lacrimal gland; WT mice had increased clearance of S. aureus from the ocular surface (p< 0. 05) and reduced ocular injury compared with SP-D KO mice. The protective effects of SP-D include increased bacterial phagocytosis by neutrophils (p< 0. 05) and decreased bacterial invasion into epithelial cells (p< 0. 05) in WT mice compared to in SP-D KO mice. In the presence of inhibitor (E 64), WT mice showed enhanced bacterial clearance (p< 0. 05) and reduced ocular injury compared to absent E 64 while SP-D KO mice did not. Collectively, we concluded that SP-D protects the ocular surface from S. aureus infection but cysteine protease impairs SP-D function in this murine model, and that cysteine protease inhibitor may be a potential therapeutic agent in <b>S.</b> aureus <b>keratitis...</b>|$|R
40|$|LasA {{protease}} is a staphylolytic endopeptidase secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We {{have examined}} the effectiveness of LasA protease {{in the treatment of}} staphylococcal keratitis caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates in a rabbit model. Keratitis was induced by intrastromal injection of the bacteria. The eyes were treated topically, and the efficacy of LasA protease was compared to those of lysostaphin (a staphylolytic protease secreted by Staphylococcus simulans) and vancomycin. When treatment was initiated early (4 h) after infection, practically all of the MSSA- and MRSA-infected corneas were sterilized by LasA protease, and its efficacy in eradicating the bacteria was comparable to those of lysostaphin and vancomycin. By contrast, most of the control corneas were heavily infected, with median values of 4. 5 × 106 (MSSA) and 5 × 105 (MRSA) CFU/cornea (P < 0. 001). When treatment was initiated late (10 h) after infection, LasA protease reduced the numbers of CFU in both MSSA- and MRSA-infected corneas by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude compared to the numbers of CFU for the controls (median values, 1, 380 and 30 CFU/cornea, respectively, for the treated animals compared to 1. 2 × 106 and 5 × 105 CFU/cornea for the respective controls [P = 0. 001]), and it was more effective than vancomycin in eradicating MRSA cells (P = 0. 02). In both the early- and the late-treatment protocols, the clinical scores for eyes treated with LasA protease were significantly lower than those for the eyes of the corresponding controls and comparable to those for the lysostaphin- and vancomycin-treated eyes. We conclude that LasA protease is effective in the treatment of experimental <b>S.</b> aureus <b>keratitis</b> in rabbits and may have potential for the treatment of disease in humans...|$|R
40|$|Staphylococcus aureus corneal {{infection}} {{results in}} extensive inflammation and tissue damage. Our {{previous studies of}} bacterial mutants have demonstrated a role for alpha-toxin in corneal virulence. This study analyzes, by genetic rescue experiments, the virulence of mutants affecting alpha-toxin and beta-toxin activity and demonstrates the ocular toxicity of these purified staphylococcal proteins. Three types of isogenic mutants were analyzed: (i) mutants specifically deficient in alpha-toxin (Hla) or beta-toxin (Hlb), (ii) a mutant deficient in both Hla and Hlb, and (iii) a regulatory mutant, deficient in the accessory gene regulator (agr), that produces reduced quantities of multiple exoproteins, including alpha- and beta-toxins. Plasmids coding for Hla and Hlb (pDU 1212 and pCU 1 hlb, respectively) were used to restore toxin activity to mutants specifically deficient {{in each of these}} toxins. Either corneas were injected intrastromally with logarithmic-phase S. aureus or purified alpha- or beta-toxins were administered to normal eyes. Ocular pathology was evaluated by slit lamp examination and myeloperoxidase activity of infiltrating polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Corneal homogenates were cultured to determine the CFU per cornea. Eyes infected with the wild-type strain developed significantly greater corneal damage than eyes infected with Agr-, Hlb-, or Hla- strains. Epithelial erosions produced by parent strains were not produced by Agr- or Hla- strains. Hlb+ strains, unlike Hlb- strains, caused scleral edema. Plasmid pDU 1212 restored corneal virulence to strain DU 1090 (Hla-), and plasmid pCU 1 hlb restored corneal virulence to strain DU 5719 (Hlb-). Application of purified alpha-toxin produced corneal epithelial erosions and iritis, while application of beta-toxin caused scleral inflammation. These studies confirm the role of alpha-toxin as a major virulence factor during <b>S.</b> aureus <b>keratitis</b> and implicate beta-toxin, a mediator of edema, as a lesser contributor to ocular damage...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{review the}} in vitro {{susceptibility}} and the clinical response to 0. 3 &#x 0025; ciprofloxacin in Staphylococcus aureus keratitis. METHODS: This is a non-comparative case series {{derived from a}} prospectively collected database and analysed retrospectively. One hundred and twenty one patients presenting in the cornea service of LV Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad, India, between January 1993 and December 2000, and identified to have <b>S.</b> aureus <b>keratitis</b> {{were included in the}} study. All patients had received slitlamp evaluation of the cornea and diagnostic microbiologic workup. They were treated with topical antimicrobial therapy based on smear and culture results. All S. aureus isolates were tested for antibiotic susceptibility by disk diffusion and those resistant to ciprofloxacin were confirmed by testing for minimum inhibitory concentration. The patients&#x 2032; clinical response to the antimicrobial therapy was noted. RESULTS: Twenty-five (20. 6 &#x 0025;) of 121 isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin on in vitro susceptibility testing were further analysed in this study. Fifteen of these 25 (60 &#x 0025;) patients were initially treated with topical ciprofloxacin. Twelve of 15 (80 &#x 0025;) patients showed no clinical improvement (3 - 8 days). Based on antibiotic susceptibility results, the antibiotic therapy was modified to fortified cefazolin and gentamicin in seven (58. 3 &#x 0025;), to vancomycin in one and to chloramphenicol in four cases. The corneal infiltrate resolved in 11 (73. 3 &#x 0025;) of 15 cases. Two patients required penetrating keratoplasty (PK), one required evisceration, and one patient was lost to follow up. Nine of 25 patients were initially started on fortified cefazolin and gentamicin therapy based on smear positive for gram-positive cocci; this resulted in resolution of infiltrate in 44. 4 &#x 0025; (4 / 9) while three required change of antibiotics (vancomycin- 2, chloramphenicol- 1), one required PK and one patient was lost to follow up. One of 25 patients started and continued on chloramphenicol, showed no response and required PK. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a significant resistance of S. aureus to many antibiotics including ciprofloxacin and highlights the need for an alternative to ciprofloxacin monotherapy for the treatment of staphylococcal keratitis...|$|R
40|$|Microbial {{keratitis}} is a {{major cause}} of avoidable visual impairment worldwide with S. aureus a leading cause of this disease in humans. Recently S. aureus isolated from eye infections have exhibited resistance to many antibiotics with those isolates from more severe infections exhibiting higher rates of antibiotic resistance. New therapies are therefore needed to ensure adequate treatment for these infections. In microbial keratitis the hosts' immune response is responsible for significant disease pathology so development of a therapy which also targets the immune response would be beneficial. The fimbrolides produced by Delisea pulchra are potential candidates as they are both growth inhibitory and immunomodulatory in vitro. The antibiotic susceptibility of clinical S. aureus isolates from ocular infections was determined using the CDS method and similarity of these isolates determined by PFGE and PCR-ribotyping. In addition the effect of fimbrolides on bacterial growth alone or in combination with antibiotics and the immune response to bacterial stimulation in PMNs and HCE cells was determined. Fimbrolides were then topically applied to S. aureus corneal infections and the effect of these compounds on disease progression determined by assessing corneal pathology, bacterial numbers and PMNs recovered from infected corneas. A larger proportion of keratitis isolates exhibited resistance to antibiotics than conjunctivitis isolates. Keratitis isolates were also related within a geographical region. The fimbrolides inhibited bacterial growth and modulated the immune response to bacterial stimulation in vitro. These compounds also exhibited synergy with conventional antimicrobials. In combination with ciprofloxacin the fimbrolides reduced the clinical score and numbers of bacteria recovered from ciprofloxacin-resistant or ciprofloxacin-sensitive S. aureus corneal infections. This thesis has identified that S. aureus isolates which produce the worst disease pathology in the eye are related and also exhibit higher rates of resistance to antibiotics indicating novel therapies to treat these infections are needed. This thesis demonstrated that fimbrolides inhibit S. aureus growth, exhibit synergy with antibiotics and modulate the immune response in vitro. In combination with ciprofloxacin the fimbrolides also improved disease pathology in keratitis, illustrating the potential of fimbrolides to be used as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of <b>S.</b> aureus <b>keratitis...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Dry eye is {{the most}} common eye disease, {{affecting}} 5 - 6% of the population. Prevalence rises to 6 - 9.8% in postmenopausal women, and as high as 34% in the elderly. [...] Tears lubricate the lid and are important for the refraction of light. Tears also promote epithelial health. Only {{a small fraction of the}} estimated 1543 proteins in tears are differentially deficient or upregulated in dry eye. Analysis of lacritin requires 1D or 2D SDS PAGE to differentiate monomer from tissue transglutaminase inactivated polymer. Accordingly, lacritin monomer was reported to be differentially downregulated in mild to severe aqueous deficient dry eye, and in contact lens-related dry eye. In a larger trial, 95% of tears from patients with aqueous deficient dry eye were lacritin monomer deficient. In Sjogren's syndrome dry eye, lacritin monomer deficiency appears to be linked with corneal staining and nerve pathology. Two studies that did not differentiate monomer from multimer did note any change of lacritin in dry eye. Topical treatment of eyes of dry eye mice (Aire knockout mouse model of dry eye) restored tearing, and suppressed both corneal staining and the size of inflammatory foci in lacrimal glands. Lacritin monomer deficiency in tears of patients with blepharitis was also reported. [...] Blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelid often associated with dry eye. In climatic droplet keratopathy, N119 appears to be un-glycosylated. Also a normal breast cancer localization reported by some has not been replicated in Unigene (the 'mammary gland' hit is for breast cancer) and gene array studies, but some breast cancers appear to display elevated expression or LACRT gene amplification. iTRAQ analysis of tears from diabetics at different stages of disease detected relatively more lacritin, lysozyme, lipophilin A, lipocalin 1, immunoglobulin lambda chain and lactotransferrin in tears of patients with diabetic retinopathy. The analysis did not distinguish lacritin monomer from polymer, and proposed the application of all as biomarkers. Tear lacritin monomer is barely detectable in the initial stage of infection by Fusarium solani in fungal keratitis.

40|$|Bacterial {{keratitis}} is {{a serious}} ophthalmic disease with significant visual morbidity. The aims of this thesis are to investigate (1) the prevalence and type of bacterial virulence factors in the two major species causing keratitis; Staphylococcal aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and (2) the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of meropenem, a potentially novel antimicrobial for use in keratitis. The prevalence, genetic diversity and clinical relevance of the lukSF-PV gene, encoding the bacterial toxin Panton Valentine Leukocidin, were investigated in S. aureus, isolated from cases of bacterial keratitis in the UK. Patients with lukSF-PV+ve S. aureus {{were found to be}} associated with a trend to worse clinical outcome and more surgical interventions, with an effect unrelated to minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). This suggests that lukSF-PV may be an important virulence factor in <b>S.</b> aureus associated <b>keratitis.</b> The genetic characteristics of P. aeruginosa isolates collected from patients with bacterial keratitis were compared between two time periods; 2003 - 04 and 2009 - 10 using an Array Tube genotyping system. 71 % of keratitis-associated P. aeruginosa isolates clustered together, with no evidence for major variations in the distribution of clone types between the two time periods. The “core keratitis cluster” was found {{to be related to the}} P. aeruginosa eccB clonal complex, which is associated with adaptation to survival in environmental water. This suggests that adaptation to environmental water is a key factor in the ability of P. aeruginosa to cause keratitis. Further analysis of clinical data and studies involving additional sets of patients for verification of this hypothesis will provide a clearer picture. Pharmacodynamic properties of commonly used and potentially novel antimicrobials were determined by calculating MICs against isolates from patients with keratitis. Antimicrobial combinations were investigated for synergy or antagonism against isolates of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa using E-Tests. Meropenem was identified as a potentially novel antimicrobial for use in keratitis, offering broad-spectrum cover against both Gram-positive and -negative microorganisms. Meropenem was also shown to show synergistic properties when used in combination with other commonly used antimicrobials. In light of these results, the antimicrobial meropenem was chosen to undergo further pharmacokinetic studies. MTT and Live Dead toxicity assays were performed on human keratocytes and human corneal epithelial cells treated with meropenem. Meropenem was found to have low toxicity against these cells. Corneal penetration of meropenem was assessed in human cadaver corneo-scleral discs mounted onto artificial anterior chambers.
