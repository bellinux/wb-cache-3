40|$|DE 102009052354 A 1 UPAB: 20110524 NOVELTY - The <b>pane</b> (1) has a {{polarization}} filter (2) oriented {{such that}} the filter exhibits minimum transmission for s-polarized light below an angle of incidence (alpha) to a normal (6) of the <b>pane,</b> where the angle lies in a range between 50 degree and 70 degree. The polarization filter is arranged on an inner side (11) of the <b>pane</b> that is made of tempered safety glass or composite safety glass. An inner <b>pane</b> and an outer window <b>pane</b> are connected by a connecting film, where a reflection-reducing coating is applied on an inner side of the inner <b>pane.</b> USE - <b>Pane</b> e. g. front <b>pane</b> and rear <b>pane,</b> for a vehicle such as motor vehicle i. e. passenger car (all claimed). Can {{also be used for}} a land vehicle i. e. rail vehicle, a water vehicle i. e. ship and an air vehicle i. e. aircraft. ADVANTAGE - The polarization filter is oriented {{such that the}} filter exhibits the minimum transmission for s-polarized light below the angle of incidence to the normal of the <b>pane,</b> where the angle lies in the range between 50 degree and 70 degree, thus ensuring decreased light reflection in the <b>pane.</b> The <b>pane</b> is made of tempered safety glass or composite safety glass, thus avoiding breaking of the <b>pane</b> into small pieces in case of destruction caused by pre-loading, and hence avoiding danger of injury to a driver...|$|R

By 1831, the population of Givors had risen to 9,210. There were many factories making window <b>panes,</b> bottles and glasses, and the port had a busy trade in coal shipment. Ten large glass works had been established at Rive-de-Gier that also transported their products by the canal.|$|E
5|$|Many booklet stamps can be {{identified}} by one non-perforated edge, though a few are perforated on all edges. On booklets up to 1977, the printing plate construction enabled both upright and inverted watermarks in equal quantities owing to a gutter dividing rows 6 and 7 in the sheets of 12 × 10 stamps. The gutter was used for stitching during assembly, requiring rows 4–6 and 10–12 to be turned through 180 degrees so those <b>panes</b> could be stitched on {{the left of the}} booklet.|$|E

These rooms feature a range of pink and purple window glass, which tradition says was installed by the Earl of Liverpool to protect his wife's eyesight; recent analysis shows {{that some of the}} pink-tinted glass dates from the 1730s, and discoloured naturally over time, while other <b>panes</b> were intentionally purchased around 1800 in these hues, but probably as status symbols and not for any medical purpose.|$|E
