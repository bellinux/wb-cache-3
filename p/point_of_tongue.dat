5000|$|As a result, {{the differing}} <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>tongue</b> contact (laminal, apical and subapical) are {{significant}} largely for retroflex sounds. Retroflex sounds can also occur {{outside of the}} postalveolar region, ranging from {{as far back as}} the hard palate to as far forward as the alveolar region behind the teeth. Subapical retroflex sounds are often palatal (and vice versa); such sounds occur particularly in the Dravidian languages. Alveolar retroflex sounds tend to be apical (the so-called [...] "apico-alveolar sibilants"), which are well-known from their occurrence in northern Iberia, such as in Astur-Leonese, Basque, Castilian Spanish, Catalan, Galician and Northern Portuguese. As a result of the large number of retroflex varieties, differing IPA symbols are sometimes used; for example, more forward articulations are often denoted , with a retracted diacritic attached to alveolar , rather than [...]|$|R

500|$|The backness of vowels (that is, the {{horizontal}} position <b>of</b> the highest <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tongue)</b> depends {{to a great}} extent on the quality (broad or slender) of adjacent consonants. Some researchers (e.g. , , [...] ) have argued that [...] and [...] are actually allophones of the same phoneme, as are [...] and , as in a vertical vowel system. Under this view, these phonemes are not marked at an abstract level as either front vowels or back vowels. Rather, they acquire a specification for frontness or backness from the consonants around them. In this article, however, the more traditional assumption that [...] are four distinct phonemes will be followed. The descriptions of the allophones in this section come from the pronunciations therefore reflect the Munster accent of the Dingle Peninsula. Unless otherwise noted, however, they largely hold for other Munster and Connacht accents as well.|$|R

During the reign of Henry III, the pennon acquired the distinctive swallow-tail, or the single-pointed shape. Another version of the single-pointed pennon {{was introduced in the}} 13th century. In shape this was a scalene triangle, obtained by cutting diagonally the vertically oblong banner.|$|R

Moreover, a little bay penetrated into the cavern, the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> which bay ended between the two fires. Here the water, which was not more than six or eight feet wide, and shallow, formed the berthing place of a good-sized canoe that lay there. The walls of the cavern, from the turn to the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tongue</b> <b>of</b> water, were pierced with four doorways, two on either side, which led, I presume, to chambers hewn in the rock.

40|$|The human tongue plays {{important}} roles {{in the production of}} intelligible speech, in the maintenance of an airway during breathing and swallowing, and in the processing of food in the mouth. An understanding <b>of</b> the <b>tongue’s</b> dynamics and control would be very helpful to those who study speech production, to those who treat macroglossia surgically [5], and to those who use certain approaches in treating sleep apnea [6]. The biomechanics <b>of</b> the <b>tongue</b> is unusual. There is no rigid structure, such as bone, in the tongue. This makes it one {{of a small group of}} biomechanical systems—other examples are the squid’s tentacles and the elephant’s trunk—known as “muscular hydrostats ” [3]. The rich collection of movements of which these systems are capable results from the interaction of actively contracting muscles with the incompressibility of the overall structure. In the case of speech, it is the shape <b>of</b> the <b>tongue</b> that is important. There have been many efforts to develop a computer model <b>of</b> the <b>tongue’s</b> dynamics, beginning with the work of Perkell [2]. All models begin with a discretization <b>of</b> the <b>tongue,</b> usually in the form of finite elements. Mathematical questions have been largely ignored. Our work is novel in part because we have created a genuine mathematical model <b>of</b> the <b>tongue.</b> As a result, we can at least ask whether the finite element approximation might converge in the limit as the elements are made smaller and smaller. The first steps in developing a mathematical description of the dynamics <b>of</b> the <b>tongue</b> are very straightforward. The tongue is well approximated by an incompressible elastic structure that undergoes large deformations. This means that the material form for the dynamics is preferable. The model thus begins as follows: Let z denote a material <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tongue.</b> The <b>tongue</b> consists <b>of</b> a set <b>of</b> <b>points</b> z ∈ B ⊂ R 3. Let p(z,t) denote the position <b>of</b> material <b>point</b> z at time t. Then...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper investigates how {{prosodic}} boundary strength (IPi vs. IPm) {{affects the}} production of the vowels /i, e, ɛ, a/, which contrast on a four degrees of height scale in French. Acoustic and tongue configuration data are examined for four speakers. Results show an expansion of the vowel space in IP-initial position that is achieved by a rising of F 2 for /i, e, ɛ/ and of F 1 for /ɛ, a/. Differences in tongue configuration also contribute to an expansion of the articulatory space in IP-initial position are also observed. Measurements on the highest <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tongue</b> show a narrowing of the constriction for /i, e, ɛ/, accompanied by fronting for /e, ɛ/, and a widening and backing of the constriction for /a/ for most speakers. These variations in IP-initial position lead to a maximization of phonetic contrasts in terms of height and frontness within the pairs /e-ɛ/ and /ɛ-a/ for most speakers, but not within the pair /i, e/, probably due to articulatory/acoustic constraints...|$|R

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{researched}} sound symbolic effects is that of size or magnitude symbolism. In an early study, Sapir (1929) presented participants pairings of three letter nonwords following the pattern of consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC), only differing by the middle vowel. One nonword contained a back vowel sound {{and the other a}} front vowel sound. Front vowels are produced when the tongue’s highest point is {{toward the front of the}} mouth during sound production such as the vowel phonemes/ɪ/and/e/(e.g., the [i] in bit and the [ee] in bee). Back vowels are produced when the highest <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tongue</b> is toward the back of the mouth such as in the vowel phonemes/o/(e.g., the [o] in boat) and/u/(e.g., the [oo] in boot; Klink, 2009). Sapir (1929) tested which of the artificial words conveyed “smallness” or “largeness” by giving participants a referent such as a table. Generally, back vowel nonwords were associated with largeness (i.e., the large table) and front vowel nonwords with smallness (i.e., the small table). Over 80 % of participants were in agreement across a large number of nonword pairs. Sapir found similar results in children, university students, American adults, and Chinese speakers, confirming the generality of the effect.|$|R

40|$|International audienceArticulatory and {{acoustic}} signals recorded from 2 {{patients who}} underwent the resection <b>of</b> a <b>tongue</b> carcinoma were analyzed longitudinally. The data were recorded {{before and after}} intra-oral surgery (1 month and 3 months after). Lingual movements were recorded with ultrasound. We focused on the lingual stop consonants and the lingual sibilants of French. The analysis was based on spectral moments (COG, skewness, kurtosis) and VOT. Recording ultrasound data requires a calibration which measures {{the position of the}} probe in reference to the subject's head. This is classically done with an optical system. However such an experimental setup cannot be easily used with patients in a clinical context. Hence, the analysis of the articulatory data required elaborating a methodology enabling to compensate a posteriori for the absence of calibration [...] It was based on 2 measurements: (1) the variation rate of the area <b>of</b> the <b>tongue</b> section in the mid-sagittal plane, which is a way to assess tongue mobility, and the height <b>of</b> the highest <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tongue,</b> which is a way to assess tongue deformation. A perceptual evaluation of the consonants in pre- and post-surgery conditions was also carried out by speech therapists,. This serves as a reference to evaluate the discrimination capacity of the proposed acoustic and articulatory analysis. Results Acoustics: For both subjects, the Skewness is the most efficient spectral parameter to account for the results of the perceptual evaluation for sibilants in context /i/ and /a/. VOT is relevant to characterize articulation changes in [ka] and in [ga]. Articulatory data: Bad perception scores in post-surgery conditions were associated with a a low lingual mobility for a patient and with a low capacity to shape the tongue for the other one. Compensation: Differences still exists between the consonants in pre- and in post-operation conditions. Three months is not a sufficient delay to recover the articulation on these consonants...|$|R
