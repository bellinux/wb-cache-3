40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{significant}} research on organic light emitting devices (OLED) due to their great potential for flat panel displays. Generally, their research mainly focuses on three aspects: the color, <b>power</b> luminous <b>efficiency</b> and lifetime of the OLED. To compete the performance of conventional LEDs, the <b>power</b> luminance <b>efficiency</b> {{is the most important}} issue. The calculation of the efficiency of OLED is under direct current (DC) driving. However, for flat panel display applications such as a passive matrix OLED, the pixels are driven by pulse voltage and under a time division multiplexing driving scheme. Under this condition, it is reported that the <b>power</b> luminous <b>efficiency</b> will be drop dramatically when increasing the number of scanning lines. The relationship between the drop of <b>power</b> luminous <b>efficiency</b> and number of scanning line will be discussed. Also, a convert from the <b>power</b> luminous <b>efficiency</b> which measured under DC driving to the <b>power</b> luminous <b>efficiency</b> which measured under time division multiplexing driving. In general, the surface emission angular pattern of OLED is assumed as a Lambertian radiation pattern. That is a surface emission angular pattern of cosθ. For calculating the <b>power</b> luminous <b>efficiency</b> η (η = L/P) with this assumption, the normal direction luminous of OLED can be converted to the total luminous flux L in the half space. However, it is reported that the surface emission angular pattern of the OLED is thickness dependent.

Computer model is created using geometrical, thermal and kinetic parameters to determine the efficiency of CVT. Results are compared by other models to confirm the model validity. Geometrical parameters are obtained by means of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, while the optimization objective is to maximize the <b>power</b> transmission <b>efficiency.</b> Optimization was conducted over a wide range of selected input parameters that are EHL oil temperature, roller tilting angle and rotational velocity of input disk. Optimization results show that the <b>power</b> transmission <b>efficiency</b> alters with changes of input parameters, while the optimized geometrical parameters are approximately the same. Variations of <b>power</b> transmission <b>efficiency</b> over a wide range of input parameters were calculated for optimized geometry, while the highest value of <b>power</b> transmission <b>efficiency</b> occurs in low value of EHL oil temperatures and input disk rotational velocities.

An advantage of p-11B as a fusion fuel is that the primary reactor output would be energetic alpha particles, which can be directly converted to electricity at high efficiency using direct energy conversion.

25|$|Better <b>power</b> <b>efficiency</b> and thickness: LCDs filter {{the light}} emitted from a backlight, {{allowing}} {{a small fraction}} of light through. Thus, they cannot show true black. However, an inactive OLED element does not produce light or consume power, allowing true blacks. Removing the backlight also makes OLEDs lighter because some substrates are not needed. When looking at top-emitting OLEDs, thickness also plays a role when talking about index match layers (IMLs). Emission intensity is enhanced when the IML thickness is 1.3–2.5nbsp&nm. The refractive value and the matching of the optical IMLs property, including the device structure parameters, also enhance the emission intensity at these thicknesses.|$|E
