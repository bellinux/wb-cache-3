40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} theory for {{designing}} stable interconnection of linear active multi-port networks at the <b>ports.</b> Such <b>interconnections</b> {{can lead to}} unstable networks even if the original networks are stable with respect to bounded port excitations. Hence such a theory is necessary for realising interconnections of active multiport networks. Stabilization theory of linear feedback systems using stable coprime factorizations of transfer functions has been well known. This theory witnessed glorious developments in recent past culminating into the H_∞ approach to design of feedback systems. However these important developments have seldom been utilized for network interconnections due {{to the difficulty of}} realizing feedback signal flow graph for multi-port networks with inputs and outputs as port sources and responses. This paper resolves this problem by developing the stabilization theory directly in terms of port connection description without formulation in terms of signal flow graph of the implicit feedback connection. The stable <b>port</b> <b>interconnection</b> results into an affine parametrized network function in which the free parameter is itself a stable network function and describes all stabilizing port compensations of a given network.

This 75 MHz prototype system is implemented with an FPGA board and includes 64 processors in 4 clusters of 16 each, 256 KB of on-chip memory, 1 DRAM controller, a custom 4 X 8 <b>port</b> <b>interconnection</b> network and an efficient multi-operands fetch-and-add unit. The on-chip memory system {{is composed of}} 8 shared modules and the memory address space is divided among these modules. A chip-level interconnection network connects the processors, memory modules, and extends to main memory DRAMs. The XMT FPGA system has been up and running at UMD nearly flawlessly since January, 2007. Orders of magnitude faster than software-based simulation, FPGA-based emulation could test much heavier applications. However, our first FPGA prototype was a real system constrained by physical limits. We sought {{to use it in}} order to project the performance of a different (more advanced) system. If clock rate of all components of the projected system can be uniformly slowed down by the same ratio, the cycle counts can be used for performance study. However, uniform slow down cannot be done if SDRAM is used in the system, because of its dynamic behavior and various timing constraints. In this talk, we will: (i) briefly overview the XMT FPGA prototype, and (ii) describe our ideas on how to project performance of a higher clock XMT system using the XMT FPGA system as an emulator when SDRAM is involved. We also demonstrate the accuracy of the projection by comparing the cycle counts from a cycle accurate software-based simulator for a set of benchmarks; the projection error is within the range 1. 3 % to- 2. 7 %. ...|$|R
30|$|With the one-port assumption, a nice {{feature of}} all {{communications}} {{used in the}} proposed algorithm such as, the prefix-sum, monotone routing or shift, {{is that they are}} normal algorithms (Leighton 1992), that is, at any step of these communications, only one hypercube dimension is used and successive dimensions are used in successive steps. Now, a well-known fact for the normal algorithms is that they can be simulated with the same asymptotic complexity in other hypercubic networks (butterfly, cube-connected-cycles, shuffle-exchange or de Bruijn network) of the same number of nodes (Leighton 1992). Thus, the proposed parallel motion estimation algorithm can be easily <b>ported</b> to other <b>interconnection</b> network models as well.|$|R

40|$|This work is {{motivated}} by an aeronautical issue: the fuel sloshing in the tank coupled with very flexible wings. Vibrations due to these coupled phenomena can lead to problems like reduced passenger comfort and maneuverability, and even unstable behavior. Port-Hamiltonian systems (pHs) provide a unified framework for the description of multi-domain, complex physical systems and a modular approach for the interconnection of subsystems. In this work, pHs models are proposed for the equations of liquid sloshing in moving containers and for the structural equations of beams with piezoelectric actuators. The <b>interconnection</b> <b>ports</b> are used to couple the sloshing dynamics in the moving tank to the motion the beam. This coupling leads to an infinite-dimensional model of the system in the pHs form. A finite-dimensional approximation is obtained by using a geometric pseudo-spectral method that preserves the pHs structure at the discrete level. Experimental tests on a structure made of a beam and a tank were carried out to validate the finite-dimensional model of liquid sloshing in moving containers. Finally, the pHs model proves useful to design an active control law for the reduction of sloshing phenomena...|$|R
40|$|The port-Hamiltonian {{modelling}} {{and control}} of power converters has been the topic {{of a number of}} studies for the past couple years. However, the modelling of three-phase converters from fundamental port-Hamiltonian principles has been an unexplored direction. This study focusses on deducing a modelling procedure to model a three-phase rectifier and a three-phase inverter from a fundamental port-Hamiltonian perspective. Such a perspective involves the derivation of a model from a mathematical expression of the Dirac structure. Two procedures are formulated, where either the switches are viewed as virtual elements or as nonlinear elements. The study concludes that both techniques are equally suitable for the modelling of the rectifier and the inverter. Furthermore, incorporating non-ideal switches is easier when regarding them as nonlinear elements, but obtaining a parametrised form (parametrised by the switch state) is more straightforward when regarding them as virtual elements. Both methods require us to identify the currents and voltages in the network as efforts and flows based on the network topology. However, this turns out to be ambiguous for the conjugate variables of the <b>interconnection</b> <b>ports</b> and switches. To cope with this, two conventions are proposed.

40|$|Aquesta Tesi estudia el control d'un sistema complex, un sistema d'emmagatzement d'energia cinètica, incloent les seves especificacions de control, modelat, disseny de controladors, simulacions, muntatge i validació experimental. Primerament, s'estudia l'interconnexió i control dels sistemes electromecànics. Es presenta el formalisme Hamiltonià (PCHS) en general, i després particularitzant en els sistemes electromecànics, inclòs els sistemes d'estructura {{variable}} (VSS). L'IDA-PBC (Interconnection and damping assignment-passivity based control) és una tècnica de control basat en els PCHS. En aquesta Tesi s'estudien el problemes que apareixen en controlar, per IDA-PBC, sortides de grau relatiu u quan el paràmetres nominals del controlador són incerts. Per evitar-los es proposa introduir una acció integral que pot ésser interpretada dins l'estructura Hamiltoniana. En aquesta Tesi també es presenten dues modificacions que permeten millorar el rang d'aplicacions de la tècnica IDA-PBC. Primer, es demostra que el fet de descomposar la tècnica de l'IDA-PBC en deformar la funció d'energia i una injecció de fregament, redueix el conjunt de sistemes que es poden estabilitzar mitjançant aquest mètode. Per evitar aquest problema, es proposa fer simultàniament els dos passos donant lloc a l'anomenat SIDA-PBC. Per altre costat, el mètode IDA-PBC requereix el coneixement de la funció energia (o Hamiltonià). Això representa un problema perquè, en general, el punt d'equilibri depèn de paràmetres incerts. En aquest treball es desenvolupa una metodologia per seleccionar l'estructura Hamiltoniana que redueix aquesta dependència dels paràmetres. Aquesta tècnica permet millorar la robustesa dels les sortides d'ordre relatiu superior a u. El sistema d'emmagatzement d'energia cinètica consisteix en una màquina d'inducció doblament alimentada (DFIM) amb un volant d'inèrcia, controlada pel rotor per un convertidor de potència back-to-back (B 2 B). L'objectiu és gestionar el flux d'energia entre la DFIM i una càrrega local connectada a la xarxa, commutant entre diferents punts de funcionament. Per això es planteja una gestió de l'energia, basada en la velocitat òptima de la DFIM. Pel què fa al control de la DFIM, es proposa un nou esquema de control que ofereix importants avantatges, i que és considerablement més senzill que el mètode clàssic, el vector control. Aquest nou controlador permet una fàcil descomposició de les potències activa i reactiva de l'estator, i el seu {{control a}} través de les tensions de rotor. Aquest disseny s'obté aplicant el procediment que millora la robustesa de l'IDA-PBC. S'han estudiat d'altres controladors, com el vector control clàssic. També a partir de la tècnica IDA-PBC, on l'equació en derivades parcials que apareix en aplicar el mètode es pot resoldre fixant l'energia en llaç tancat, i afegint nous termes a la matriu d'interconnexió. Per obtenir un controlador definit globalment s'afegeix un terme de fregament depenent dels estats, que desacobla la part elèctrica i mecànica del sistema. Finalment, també es prova que mitjançant el SIDA-PBC es pot modelar l'energia total (elèctrica i mecànica) de la DFIM. Tots aquest controladors han estat simulats i comparats. El controlador robust IDA-PBC s'ha validat experimentalment amb uns resultats satisfactoris. A la Tesi també es presenta un controlador que permet el flux bidireccional de potència pel B 2 B. L'estudi de la dinàmica zero adverteix que les tècniques de control estàndard no garanties en l'estabilitat en ambdós direccions, i per això s'utilitza un controlador IDA-PBC. Pel disseny s'utilitza un model basat en GSSA (generalized state space averaging), on es descomposa i es trunca el sistema per determinades freqüències, i que permet expresar els objectius de control (tensió constant al bus de contínua i factor de potència unitari) com un problema de regulació. Les simulacions i els resultats experimentals validen, tant la llei de control, com les simplificacions efectuades. Els controladors proposats i validats experimentalment són usats, finalment, per implementar la gestió de potència del sistema d'emmegatzement d'energia cinètica. Els resultats confirmen el bon comportament del sistema i dels controladors IDA-PBC proposats. This Thesis studies a complex multidomain system, the Flywheel Energy Storage System, including the control objectives specification, modeling, control design, simulation, experimental setup assembling and experimental validation stages. The <b>port</b> <b>interconnection</b> {{and control of}} electromechanical systems is studied. The port Hamiltonian formalism is presented in general, and particularized for generalized electromechanical systems, including variable structure systems (VSS). Interconnection and damping assignment-passivity based control (IDA-PBC) is a well known technique for port Hamiltonian systems (PCHS). In this Thesis we point out the kind of problems that can appear in the closed-loop structure obtained by IDA-PBC methods for relative degree one outputs, when nominal values are used in a system with uncertain parameters. To correct this, we introduce an integral control, which can be cast into the Hamiltonian framework. This Thesis also presents two new approaches which improve the range of applicability of the IDA-PBC technique. First, we show that the standard two-stage procedure used in IDA-PBC consisting of splitting the control action into the sum of energy-shaping and damping injection terms is not without loss of generality, and effectively reduces the set of systems that can be stabilized with IDA-PBC. To overcome this problem we suggest to carry out simultaneously both stages and refer to this variation of the method as SIDA-PBC. Secondly, we present an improvement of the IDA-PBC technique. The IDA-PBC method requires {{the knowledge of the}} full energy (or Hamiltonian) function. This is a problem because, in general, the equilibrium point which is to be regulated depends on uncertain parameters. We show how select the target port-Hamiltonian structure so that this dependence is reduced. This new approach allows to improve the robustness for higher relative degree outputs. The Flywheel Energy Storage System consists of a doubly-fed induction machine (DFIM), controlled through the rotor voltage by a power electronics subsystem (a back-to-back AC/AC converter (B 2 B)), and coupled to flywheel. The control objective is to optimally regulate the power flow between the DFIM and a local load connected to the grid, and this is achieved by commuting between different steady-state regimes. A police management based on the optimal speed for the DFIM is proposed. In this Thesis we propose a new control scheme for the DFIM that offers significant advantages, and is considerably simpler, than the classical vector control method. This controller allows an easy decomposition of the active and reactive powers on the stator side and their regulation, acting on the rotor voltage, via stator current control. This design was obtained applying the new robust IDA-PBC procedure. Other controllers are also designed along the dissertation. The classical vector control is studied. We also apply the classic IDA-PBC technique. It is shown that the partial differential equation that appears in this method can be circumvented by fixing the desired closed-loop total energy and adding new terms to the interconnection structure. Furthermore, to obtain a globally defined control law we introduce a state [...] dependent damping term that has the nice interpretation of effectively decoupling the electrical and mechanical parts of the system. This results in a globally convergent controller parameterized by two degrees of freedom. Finally, we also prove that with SIDA-PBC we can shape the total energy of the full (electrical and mechanical) dynamics of the DFIM. These different controllers (vector control, IDA-PBC, SIDA-PBC and robust IDA-PBC) are simulated and compared. The IDA-PBC robust controller is also experimentally tested and shown to work satisfactorily. A controller able to achieve bidirectional power flow for the B 2 B converter is presented. Standard techniques cannot be used since it is shown that no single output yields a stable zero dynamics for power flowing both ways. The controller is computed using standard IDA-PBC techniques for a suitable generalized state space averaging truncation of the system, which transforms the control objectives, namely constant output voltage dc-bus and unity input power factor, into a regulation problem. Simulation and experimental results for the full system confirm the correctness of the simplifications introduced to obtain the controller. The proposed and tested controllers for the DFIM and the B 2 B are used to implement the power management policy. These results show a good performance of the flywheel energy storage system and also validate the IDA-PBC technique, with the proposed improvements. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The thesis revisits the {{intimate}} {{connection between the}} geometry of the configuration space of vehicles and the descriptions of their energy and power and exploits it to provide novel solutions to particular problems in motion control and navigation. Starting from the geometry of the configuration space, one can build additional related spaces. Elements of these spaces, together {{with those in the}} configuration space, can then be used to describe scalar storage and content functions, which relate to energy and power respectively. Once these spaces are constructed and the scalar functions adopted, geometric properties can be exploited for designing guidance and motion control strategies. The choice of coordinates assigned to each of the related spaces have bearing on the difficulty of the description of the dynamics and the design of control strategies. For example, {{it is well known that}} the choice of configuration coordinates may be used to eliminate holonomic constraints while the choice of momentum coordinates may be used to eliminate nonholonomic constraints. In cases where these coordinate choices can simplify the problem, they also favour the use of a particular storage function. The same geometric tools and choice of coordinates used to approach vehicle motion control may be used to address vision-based navigation. Indeed, the image obtained from cameras mounted on the vehicle can be projected onto a space of particular geometry, which is akin to a configuration space. From the latter, one can again build additional spaces that may be exploited to describe the phenomena of optic flow and other image features and use this to build measurement models to be used for estimation. This thesis is separated into two parts. The first part revisits the connections between energy and geometry to obtain a rigid-body model of vehicle dynamics. We exploit the symmetry highlighted explicitly in the bond-graph formalism to relate the Euler-Lagrange (EL), Hamiltonian, and Brayton-Moser (BM) equations by proposing what is believed to be a new set of unifying model equations. The proposed model retains the advantage of the BM model in that the dissipation and <b>interconnection</b> <b>ports</b> are included ab initio in the model [...] -features that the EL and Hamiltonian models must be extended to support. This part of the thesis then considers a class of mechanical systems, which includes vehicles, and addresses the problem of position set-point regulation using port-Hamiltonian theory. The geometry of the configuration space is used to construct the basis for solutions of the matching partial differential equations that allows manifold regulation for underactuated vehicles. We present examples of underactuated mechanical systems that illustrate the application of the proposed control design method. These examples include a marine surface vessel and a quadrotor helicopter. We also discuss examples beyond vehicles such as a robot manipulator mounted on a flexible foundation. The second part of the thesis considers the problem of visual navigation. A new model for optic flow is developed for use in state estimation. This model is motivated by a particular choice of state, which is inspired by the geometric aspects of the problem. This choice of state is also exploited to outline adaptations to visual simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM), including the fusion with optic flow, and the tracking of landmarks that exploits the observable directions in the optic flow field...|$|R
