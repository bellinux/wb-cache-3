5|$|The nearby Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel {{is being}} planned to connect northeastern New Jersey and Long Island, with portals in Brooklyn and in Jersey City, New Jersey. The tunnel is being planned {{as a result}} of {{passenger}} and commuter traffic frequencies being at capacity and precluding freight movements.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was twofold: first, provide an {{understanding}} of the technical foundation and planning required for deployment of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) -based system architectures for the protection <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York City from a terrorist attack using a vehicle-deployed nuclear device; second, work with stakeholders to develop mutual understanding of the technologies and tactics required for threat detection/identification and establish guidelines for designing operational systems and procedures. During the course of this project we interviewed and coordinated analysis with people from the New Jersey State Attorney General's office, the New Jersey State Police, the <b>Port</b> <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York/New Jersey, the Counterterrorism Division <b>of</b> the <b>New</b> York City Police Department, the New Jersey Transit <b>Authority,</b> the State <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Jersey Department <b>of</b> Transportation, TRANSCOM and a number of contractors involved with state and federal intelligent transportation development and implementation. The basic system architecture is shown in the figure below. In an actual system deployment, radiation sensors would be co-located with existing ITS elements and the data will be sent to the Traffic Operations Center. A key element of successful system operation is the integration of vehicle data, such as license plate, EZ pass ID, vehicle type/color and radiation signature. A threat data base can also be implemented and utilized in cases where there is a suspect vehicle identified from other intelligence sources or a mobile detector system. Another key aspect of an operational architecture is the procedures used to verify the threat and plan interdiction. This was a major focus of our work and discussed later in detail.

40|$|Sediment is accumulating in New York/New Jersey Harbor, and {{shipping}} channels are rapidly becoming too shallow for large ships. The <b>Port</b> <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York/New Jersey {{has determined that}} dredging of the ship channels is essential to keep them navigable. About five million cubic yards of sediment must be removed per year to keep the channels open. Without dredging, the channels will soon become unusable, and the shoreside shipping and warehousing businesses that depend on them will fade away. The economic loss to the area would be devastating. But the deeper layers of sediment in the Harbor contain {{a broad range of}} pollutants that are hazardous to humans and the environment-a legacy of past discharges that are no longer permitted. These include heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chlorinated pesticides, and dioxins. As a result, there are several million cubic yards of sediments to be dredged per year that do not meet applicable criteria for ocean disposal and must be dealt with in some other way. A possible solution to the problem is to treat the dredged material to immobilize or destroy the contaminants and make the treated sediments suitable for disposal in the ocean or on land at acceptable cost. A variety of technologies can be used to achieve this goal. The simplest approach is to make manufactured soil from untreated sediment. The most complex approaches involve high-temperature destruction of organic contaminants and immobilization of inorganic contaminants. When any of these technologies are used, there is potential for risks to human health from process wastes and from the treated materials themselves. Also, disposal or beneficial use of treated materials may generate other risks to human health or the environment. A description of some of the technologies considered is given in Table 1. Success in removing or immobilizing the contaminants, which varies significantly among technologies, is reported elsewhere. This report provides a preliminary evaluation, or ``screening assessment,'' of potential occupational, public, and environmental health risks from dredging, transporting, and treating contaminated harbor sediments with thermal treatment methods to render them suitable for disposal or beneficial use. The assessment was done in stages as the project advanced and data became available from other tasks on characteristics of sediments and treatment processes...|$|R

During the 1990s, approximately 500 companies had offices in the complex, including financial companies such as Morgan Stanley, Aon Corporation, and Salomon Brothers. The basement concourse of the World Trade Center included The Mall at the World Trade Center, and a PATH station.

40|$|One of {{the serious}} {{environmental}} problems that the human beings are facing is the nitrogenous pollution. It comes along with the perturbed nitrogen cycle in the nature and is mostly caused by human activities. NH 4 +, NO 2 –-N, and NO 3 [...] N are three major nitrogenous pollutants widely seen in the environment and known by most people. They are also the target compounds this thesis primarily focuses on. ^ Traditional nitrogen removal techniques apply the nitrification process to biodegrade NH 4 +, but accumulate NO 3 [...] N in the treated body. The alternating-aerobic-anoxic process combines both nitrification and denitrification in one system. Therefore, it can not only remove NH 4 + by nitrification but also eliminate NO 3 [...] N by denitrification. NO 2 [...] N exists in the system as an intermediate product of both nitrification and denitrification. The AAA process also shows the capability of removing TOC, which is oxidized under the aerobic condition and consumed by heterotrophs in the anoxic stage. If the organic carbon source is directly obtained from the existing waste stream, costs on adding external carbon will be saved. Successfully applying the biological fluidized bed reactor to the AAA process is proved in this thesis. Its advantages include saving space, eliminating sludge problems, and removing carbon and nitrogen efficiently. ^ Due to the alternating aeration, the aeration/non-aeration ratio {{is one of the}} important factors affecting the performance of the AAA process. For free NH 4 + and easily biodegradable carbon (e. g. glucose), the optimal aeration/non-aeration ratio is within a close range around 1. For a complex aromatic amine (e. g. aniline), due to its low denitrification rate, the non-aeration duration should be correspondingly increased and this makes the aeration/non-aeration ratio less than 1. Accumulation of the organic carbon in the anoxic stage is the distinguished result of a longer non-aeration process when dealing with slowly biodegradable organic compounds. ^ Applying the results of this thesis to the design of the AAA process for the joint aquacultural project between the University of Pennsylvania and the Delaware River <b>Port</b> <b>Authority</b> <b>of</b> Pennsylvania and <b>New</b> Jersey is expected in the near future. The success of the AAA process in removing aniline claims its potential application to removing toxic nitrogen containing organic compounds. ...|$|R
