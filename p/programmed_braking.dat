50|$|It was {{designed}} by OKB-2, the Design Bureau led by Aleksei Isaev, for the Vostok <b>program.</b> The <b>braking</b> engine for the first manned spacecraft was a difficult task that no design bureau wanted to take. It was considered critical, as a failure would have left a cosmonaut stranded in space. A solid engine was considered, but the ballistic experts predicted a 500 km landing error, versus a tenth of that for a liquid engine. It took the coordinated efforts of Boris Chertok and Sergei Korolev to convince Isaev to accept the task.|$|R

25|$|Trains are {{programmed}} {{to stop at}} certain station positions with a precise odometer (accurate to plus or minus five centimetres). They receive their <b>braking</b> <b>program</b> and station stop positions orders (one-third, two-thirds, or end of station) from track beacons prior to entering the station, with additional beacons in the station for ensuring stop precision. The last beacon is positioned at precisely 12 turns of wheels {{from the end of}} the platform, which help improve the overall precision of the system.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the effects of a two-day post-license driver-training <b>program</b> on <b>brake</b> {{performance}} in cars with antilock braking systems (ABS). A trainee group (n = 26) and a control group (n = 13) participated in the experiment. The trainee group were enrolled in a two-day training course that included instruction in a braking technique that may be used in cars with and without ABS. All participants performed emergency brake tests from 80 and 100 km h- 1 in an instrumented car before and after the training period. Results indicated the post-training group used a smoother braking profile, were less reliant on ABS activation, had enhanced postural stability, but took about one car length longer to stop from 100 km h- 1 compared with the control group. Implications of these results for braking in cars with and without ABS, and for driver education programs in general are discussed. No Full Tex...|$|R
5000|$|For 1999 {{a limited}} run of V 8 powered [...] "G 500 Classic" [...] special editions marked the model's 20th anniversary. A {{multifunction}} steering wheel {{was added to}} all models. Later in the year, the new G 55 AMG debuts {{as the most powerful}} G-Class yet, with 354 hp. The U.S. market launch of the G-Class took place in 2001. New alloy wheels, a chrome grille and body-color bumpers plus a more luxurious cabin were introduced. New dynamic control systems included the Electronic Stability <b>Program</b> (ESP), <b>Brake</b> Assist and the 4 wheel Electronic Traction System (4 ETS). The G 55 AMG was upgraded in 2004 with a supercharged V 8 engine developing 476 hp. In Siberia in 2006, a documentary filmmaker was the first foreigner to reach the world’s coldest region with a passenger vehicle in winter, driving a stock G 500 nearly 19,000 km without a single breakdown, in temperatures as frigid as −63˚F/-53 °C.|$|R

It was designed to fit the Japanese kei car regulations by adopting specially developed rear fenders and narrowing the track width and tire dimensions and the width reduced to 1.47 m. The engine displacement remains unchanged at 598 cc, as specified in the standard. Safety features include ESP (Electronic Stability <b>Program)</b> and BAS (<b>Brake</b> Assist System) as standard. The Smart K also facilitates the starting procedure with the Hill Start Assist that makes a starts on slopes easier. The Smart K was discontinued in November 2004.|$|R
40|$|National audienceThe HPV {{vaccine is}} the result of {{progress}} in the knowledge of HPV-induced malignancies and represents an hope for primary prevention of many epithelial cancers, mainly the cervix cancer in women. Its efficacy and safety are proven by methodologically adequate trials (randomized double-blind trials). The impact of the vaccine on large populations begins to be perceived in countries with proactive vaccination <b>programs.</b> Unfortunatly, vaccination <b>brakes</b> exist today in France explaining the relative failure of vaccination: the conviction of doctors, and the establishment of an early and wide vaccination program under the authority of government could overcome this reluctance. Progresses can be expected with the development of vaccine containing new genotypes, as in the nonavalent vaccine that compares favorably with the quadrivalent vaccine. Copyright © 2016 JLE...|$|R
50|$|The {{operational}} success {{was achieved by}} concentrating on the initial destruction of the runways with {{a new kind of}} weapon, a rocket assisted anti-runway warhead. The prototype French/Israeli anti-runway weapon <b>program</b> uses rocket <b>braking</b> over the target to point the warhead directly toward the runway being attacked; at a set altitude, a second accelerator rocket ignites and drives the warhead through the pavement of the runway before it detonates. The explosion creates a small crater over a large new sinkhole, meaning the damaged runway section must be completely removed before the sinkhole can be repaired rather than a normal bomb crater which is simply filled in and patched. Once the runways were disabled, entire air bases' complements of aircraft were effectively grounded and fell victim to subsequent attack waves, resulting in near-total Israeli air supremacy.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the cost of rear-end collisions in Denmark, and to define the potential financial benefits of a high, center-mounted auxiliary brake light for automobiles. The study was limited to passenger cars struck from behind. The annual cost of two different preventive <b>programs</b> involving auxiliary <b>brake</b> lights was compared to the annual cost of the accidents expected to be prevented in each program. The finding was that rear-end collisions cost on average over 13, 700 1980 Danish kroner (approx. US$ 2300), 70 % of which was property damage. There are so many rear-end collisions that even if the new brake-light configuration were only one-third as effective in Denmark as it has been in U. S. field trials the mounting of required auxiliary lights would be a sound investment. Substantial savings would be anticipated whether the auxiliary brake lights were required on all passenger cars as of a particular date, or only on newly registered passenger cars, although the former preventive program is preferable by usual cost benefit criteria.

40|$|It {{is shown}} in this paper that the {{presynaptic}} cell directly causes postsynaptic current in the postsynaptic neuron determines its amplitude. Combination of the electrophysiological techniques, mathematical tools, and cytochemical research allow deeper analysis {{and understanding of the}} differences in the mechanisms of generation series of actionpotentials and excitatory inhibitory neurons in the hippocampus. For electrophysiological studies of synaptic interactions involving pairs of cultured hippocampal neurons at different types of pulsed electrical activity of the presynaptic cell the following methodological approaches were used: cooking culture dissociated hippocampal neurons in low density, the method of fixing the intracellular potential on the postsynaptic neuron configuration ?whole-cell?; method of pair registration, the method of local extracellular perfusion <b>program</b> for blocking <b>brake</b> and exciting synaptic transmission and selective potassium channel blockers; cytochemical analysis, mathematical methods and processing results. It was also shown that there are two groups of GABA-ergic interneurons in hippocampal culture, which differ by the type of electrical activity: AP is able to generate high-frequency and unable to generate high-frequency capable of generating action potential in response to prolonged stimulation of depolarizing current pulses. These groups significantly differ also by the kinetic properties of AP. ????????, ??? ???????????????? ?????? ??????????????? ???????? ????????????????? ??? ? ????????????????? ??????? ? ?????????? ??? ?????????. ?????????? ????????????? ?????????????????????? ???????, ???????????????? ??????????????? ???????? ? ???????????????????? ???????????? ????????? ?????? ???????????????? ? ?????? ???????? ?????????? ????????? ????? ??????????? ???????? ?????????? ? ????????????? ????????? ? ??????????. ??? ???????????? ?????????????????????? ?????????????? ? ???????????? ????????? ????? ???????????????? ???????? ?????????? ??? ????????? ????? ?????????? ????????????? ?????????? ?????????????? ?????? ??????????? ????????? ???????????? ???????: ????????????? ???????? ??????????????? ???????? ?????????? ?????? ?????????; ????? ??????????????? ???????? ?????????? ?? ????????????????? ??????? ? ???????????? ?????? ???????; ???????? ?????? ???????????; ????? ????????? ???????????? ???????? ??? ?????????? ?????????? ????????? ? ???????????? ????????????? ???????? ? ??????????? ?????????? ???????? ???????; ???????????????????? ??????; ?????????????? ?????? ????????? ?????? ? ???????????. ????? ???? ???????? ??????? ???? ????? ????-?????????? ????????????? ? ???????? ??????????, ????????????? ?? ???? ????????????? ??????????: ????????? ???????????? ????????? ???????? ? ??????? ???????? ? ?? ????????? ? ??????????????? ????????? ?????????? ???????? ? ????? ?? ?????????? ?????????? ??????????????? ?????????? ????. ??? ?????? ?????????? ??????????? ????? ????? ????? ?? ???????????? ??????????????? ?????????? ????????...|$|R

40|$|Statistics {{shows that}} most traffic {{accidents}} with fatal outcome {{can be related}} to slippery road conditions. The most hazardous road conditions {{are the ones that are}} hard for the driver to detect and that appears sudden on the road. A sensor that classify the road condition in front of the vehicle, warning both the driver and the systems in the vehicle that are incorporated to help the driver, like the electronic stability <b>program</b> (ESP), anti-lock <b>brake</b> system (ABS) or the traction control system (TCS), could help to reduce these accidents. There are several prototypes for classification of road conditions available but they are not yet fully functional. In this thesis a method that makes it possible to classify the four distinct road conditions dry asphalt and asphalt covered with water, ice and snow, respectively, with a low probability of wrong classification using three wavelengths is presented. A prototype sensor built on the a technique using two laser diodes and a photo detector is tested in a real environment and compared with laboratory measurements which shows a promising result characterizing dry asphalt and asphalt covered with ice and snow. Both theory and experiments are presented. The most difficult road conditions to classify from each other are water and clear ice for which a method using polarized light is investigated. The investigation shows that using polarized light for illumination and a polarizer as an analyzer for classification of water and ice on asphalt is a more reliable method than using unpolarized light. All three investigations show promising results in developing an actual sensor to reduce fatal accidents in traffic. Godkänd; 2007; 20071011 (ysko...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{problem in this}} thesis {{is related to the}} sheet metal NC process and its requirements {{from the point of view}} of data transferring. The aim is to map the current state of sheet metal production of the company with its information flows, and to find the potential problems associated with it. The company is known to be implementing a new CAD design environment and the product information management system. In addition, the company’s intention is to introduce a new laser machine that will require new software to support nesting. This change has progressed to the point where the current process needs to be mapped and the related information flows identified. The research is limited to examining the sheet metal process from design to production, focusing on the programming department. The focus will be on identifying the information related to the programming department and in the stages of the production process where programming is associated. A qualitative case study, in which the interviews of the target persons have been conducted as semi-structured, is used as a research method. The knowledge of sheet metal production is expanded with a literature study that provides the basics needed to conduct a case study. For the basis of the case study, the process flow charts were developed based on the most important aspects of the sheet metal process of the company. These process flow charts present the most important work phases and the related information flow. The potential problem and challenging areas were identified based on the created process charts. These are presented in a thematic way with the aim of providing development suggestions. The challenges identified in the research were related to potential errors in the information flows as well as human based errors, to revision management, and to avoiding manual and non-productive work. In addition to this, challenges were found in the extra optimization of programming and the <b>programming</b> of press <b>brakes</b> or its absence...|$|R
