30|$|OHIP also reimburses {{surgeons}} {{for performing}} surgery on broken ankles {{to put the}} broken pieces of bone together and hold them with hardware like <b>pins,</b> <b>screws,</b> and plates. This type of surgery takes about 2  h. Surgeons receive $ 237.50 for these operations.|$|R
50|$|For {{displaced}} avulsion fractures, {{they are}} best managed by either open reduction and internal fixation or closed reduction and pinning. Open reduction (using surgical incision) and internal fixation is used when <b>pins,</b> <b>screws,</b> or similar hardware {{is needed to}} fix the bone fragment.|$|R
50|$|Chauffeur's {{fracture}} {{is a type}} of {{fracture of}} the forearm, specifically the radial styloid process. The injury is typically caused by compression of the scaphoid bone of the hand against the styloid process of the distal radius. It can be caused by falling onto an outstretched hand (FOOSH). Treatment is often open reduction and internal fixation, which is surgical realignment of the bone fragments and fixation with <b>pins,</b> <b>screws,</b> or plates.|$|R
50|$|This {{treatment}} {{also requires}} surgery by an orthopedist. <b>Pins</b> or <b>screws</b> are placed into the fractured bone {{above and below}} the fracture site. The orthopedic surgeon repositions the bone fragments and <b>pins</b> or <b>screws</b> are connected to a metal bar or bars outside the skin which holds the bones in their proper position so they can heal. The external fixation device is removed after an appropriate time period.|$|R
50|$|There are a {{wide variety}} of full and partial tang designs. In perhaps the most common design in full tang knives, the handle is cut {{in the shape of the}} tang and handle scales are then {{fastened}} to the tang by means of <b>pins,</b> <b>screws,</b> bolts, metal tubing, epoxy, etc. The tang is left exposed along the belly, butt, and spine of the handle, extending both the full length and width of the handle.|$|R
50|$|Complications of ORIF {{surgery for}} Monteggia {{fractures}} can include non-union, malunion, nerve palsy and damage, muscle damage, arthritis, tendonitis, infection, stiffness {{and loss of}} range of motion, compartment syndrome, audible popping or snapping, deformity, and chronic pain associated with surgical hardware such as <b>pins,</b> <b>screws,</b> and plates. Several surgeries {{may be needed to}} correct this type of fracture as it is almost always a very complex fracture that requires a skilled orthopedic surgeon, usually a 'specialist', familiar with this type of injury.|$|R

50|$|The pistons {{are made}} of light metal alloy and have three {{compression}} rings {{as well as one}} oil ring. They are connected to the crankshaft with I-shape connecting rods made of heat treatable steel. The bearings of the connecting rods {{are made of}} a lead bronze alloy and are fixed with a pin. Each connecting rod has a small oil pipe for the lubrication of it′s bearings. For weight reduction, the connecting rod pins are hollow-drilled. The crankshaft with hardened pins is supported in five bearings and is equipped with couter-weights to reduce crankshaft bearing wear. The covers of the crankshaft bearings are mounted with two <b>pin</b> <b>screws</b> each. The flywheel is flanged onto the crankshaft. On the opposite site of the crankshaft, it holds a friction- and vibration damper.|$|R

40|$|Background. Recent {{advances}} in biomaterial technology {{make it possible}} to produce easy-to-handle implants for osteosynthesis with ultra-high strenght and excellent biocompatibility. Biomechanical studies have shown that fixation rigidity achieved with self-reinforced (SR) <b>pins,</b> <b>screws</b> and miniplates is comparable with that of metallic fixation methods. Internal fixation by means of bioabsorbable plates, <b>screws,</b> and <b>pins</b> can be used to stabilize some fractures of small bones in the hand. We report our experience with three cases where internal fixation with a SR (poly-L/DL-lactide 70 / 30; SR-P (L/DL) LA 70 / 30, BioSorbTMFX) miniplates and screws was carried out for stabilization of a metacarpal shaft fracture and thumb replantation. Conclusions. After bone healing is complete, metallic osteosynthesis devices become unnecessary or can even be harmful. Metallic implant-related long-term complications and secondary removal operation are avoided by using of bioabsorbable osteosynthesis devices for metacarpal bones osteosynthesis. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of screw dislocations with an applied stress is studied using atomistic simulations {{in conjunction with}} a continuum treatment of the role played by the far field boundary condition. A finite cell of atoms is used to consider the response of dislocations to an applied stress and this introduces an additional force on the dislocation due to the presence of the boundary. Continuum mechanics is used to calculate the boundary force which is subsequently accounted for in the equilibrium condition for the dislocation. Using this formulation, the lattice resistance curve and the associated Peierls stress are calculated for screw dislocations in several close packed metals. As a concrete example of the boundary force method, we compute the bow out of a <b>pinned</b> <b>screw</b> dislocation; the line-tension of the dislocation is calculated from the results of the atomistic simulations using a variational principle that explicitly accounts for the boundary force. ...|$|R

5000|$|Microextrusion is an {{outgrowth}} of microforming, a science that was in its infancy in the early 1990s. In 2002, Engel et al. expressed that up to that point, only a few research experiments involving micro-deep drawing and extruding processes had been attempted, citing limitations in shearing on billets and difficulties in tool manufacturing and handling. By the mid- to late 2000s, researchers were working {{on issues such as}} billet flow, interfacial friction, extrusion force, and size effects, [...] "the deviations from the expected results that occur when the dimension of a workpiece or sample is reduced." [...] Most recently, research into using ultrafine-grained material at higher formation temperatures and applying ultrasonic vibration to the process has pushed the science further. However, before bulk production of microparts such as <b>pins,</b> <b>screws,</b> fasteners, connectors, and sockets using microforming and microextrusion techniques can occur, more research into billet production, transportation, positioning, and ejection are required.|$|R

50|$|The {{crankcase}} of the OM 138 {{consists of}} two parts, the lower part with {{the lower part of}} the crankshaft bearing and the upper part with the cylinder block and the camshaft. The lower and upper crankcase parts are connected with <b>pin</b> <b>screws</b> on the horizontal crankshaft center. The lower crankcase part is strengthened with ribs and made of a light metal alloy. The flange of the gearbox is cast onto the lower crankcase part. The upper crankcase part is made of grey cast iron, it reaches from the crankshaft to the cylinder head. On it′s front, the upper crankcase part has a bulge that holds the camshaft, so that the camshaft can be driven by the crankshaft using only two gears. The camshaft is supported in five bearings. For camshaft maintenance, the bulge on the crankcase front has a removable cover. Mountings for the starter motor, the alternator and the injection pump are also cast onto the crankcase. For the lubrication of the crank- and camshaft, the crankcase has an oil pipe drilled into.|$|R

Attention has, thus, been directed toward single-screw fixation in stable SCFE. Nevertheless, both single and multiple fixation techniques are associated with risks. Avascular necrosis (AVN), chondrolysis, loss of fixation, subtrochanteric and femoral neck fractures, pin penetration, pin breakage, pin extrusion, and infection have been reported as complications [8, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21].|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Traditional in vivo devices {{fabricated}} {{to be used}} as implantation devices included sutures, plates, <b>pins,</b> <b>screws,</b> {{and joint}} replacement implants. Also, akin to developments in regenerative medicine and drug delivery, there has been the pursuit of less conventional in vivo devices that demand complex architecture and composition, such as tissue scaffolds. Com-mercial means of fabricating traditional devices include machining and moulding processes. Such manufacturing techniques impose considerable lead times and geometrical limitations, and restrict the economic production of customized products. Attempts at the production of non-conventional devices have included particulate leaching, solvent casting, and phase trans-ition. These techniques cannot provide the desired total control over internal architecture and compositional variation, which subsequently restricts the application of these products. Con-sequently, several parties are investigating the use of freeform layer manufacturing techniques to overcome these difficulties and provide viable in vivo devices of greater functionality. This paper identifies the concepts of rapidmanufacturing (RM) and the development of biomanufac-turing based on layer manufacturing techniques. Particular emphasis is placed on the develop-ment and experimentation of new materials for bio-RM, production techniques based on the layer manufacturing concept, and computer modelling of in vivo devices for RM techniques...|$|R
30|$|The {{field of}} {{orthopaedics}} is a constantly evolving discipline. Despite the historical success of plates, <b>pins</b> and <b>screws</b> in fracture reduction and stabilisation, {{there is a}} continuing search for more efficient and improved methods of fracture fixation. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate shape-memory staples and to compare them to a currently used implant for internal fracture fixation. Multi-plane bending stability and interfragmentary compression were assessed across a simulated osteotomy using single and double-staple fixation and compared to a bridging plate.|$|R
30|$|Fractures {{that are}} unstable, malrotated and {{displaced}} by over 2  mm usually undergo open reduction internal fixation usually with wires, smooth <b>pins</b> or <b>screws</b> [8, 9]. Debate persists {{as to how}} much displacement and fracture instability is required before open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) is indicated [2, 10]. Recently published studies further challenge the necessity of open reduction of a displaced fracture, advocating good results following close reduction and internal fixation (CRIF) of completely displaced and rotated fragments [9].|$|R
