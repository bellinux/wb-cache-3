To further examine the role of ARX in human pancreatic endocrine development, we utilized genomic editing in hESCs to generate deletions in ARX. ARX knockout hESCs retained pancreatic differentiation capacity and ARX knockout endocrine cells were biased toward somatostatin-positive cells (94 % of endocrine cells) with reduced pancreatic polypeptide (rarely detected), glucagon (90 % reduced) and insulin-positive (65 % reduced) lineages. ARX knockout somatostatin-positive cells shared expression patterns with human fetal and adult δ-cells. Differentiated ARX knockout cells upregulated PAX 4, NKX 2. 2, ISL 1, HHEX, PCSK 1, PCSK 2 expression while downregulating PAX 6 and IRX 2.

In the present study we investigated whether monocytes are responsive to insulin. Methods and Results: LPS-induced Tissue Factor (TF) upregulation was measured in human monocytes and monocytic THP- 1 cells in a factor Xa generation assay. Insulin (0. 1 - 100 nM) induced a dose-dependent inhibition in both cell types and in monocytes 100 nM insulin inhibited cytosolic, membrane-bound and microparticle TF by 32 +/- 2, 27 +/- 3 and 52 +/- 4 % (n= 3). Insulin induced Tyr phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (INS-R) and formation of an INS-R - G(i) alpha(2) complex, suggesting interference with LPS-induced cAMP control. <b>Indeed,</b> <b>insulin</b> interfered with LPS-induced cAMP decrease and TF upregulation {{in a manner similar}} to an inhibitor of G(i) (pertussis toxin) and agents that raise cAMP (iloprost, forskolin, IBMX) reduced TF upregulation.

We investigated whether lipid peroxidation inhibition might reduce NF-kappaB activation and the inflammatory response in cerulein-induced pancreatitis. Male Sprague-Dawley rats of 230 - 250 g body weight received administration of cerulein (80 mug/kg s. c. for each of four injections at hourly intervals). A control group received four s. c. injections of 0. 9 % saline at hourly intervals.

All these rats were sacrificed 2 h after the last injection of either cerulein or its vehicle. Raxofelast administration (20 mg/kg i. p. with the first cerulein) significantly reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, an index of lipid peroxidation (CER+DMSO= 3. 075 +/- 0. 54 mumol/g; CER+raxofelast= 0. 693 +/- 0. 18 mumol/g; p < 0. 001), decreased myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity (CER+DMSO= 22. 2 +/- 3. 54 mU/g; CER+raxofelast= 9. 07 +/- 2. 05 mU/g; p < 0. 01), increased glutathione levels (GSH) (CER+DMSO= 5. 21 +/- 1. 79 mumol/g; CER+raxofelast= 15. 71 +/- 2. 14 mumol/g; p < 0. 001), and reduced acinar cell damage evaluated by means of histology and serum levels of both amylase (CER+DMSO= 4063 +/- 707. 9 U/l; CER+raxofelast= 1198 +/- 214. 4 U/l; p < 0. 001), and lipase (CER+DMSO= 1654 +/- 330 U/l; CER+raxofelast= 386 +/- 118. 2 U/l; p < 0. 001), Furthermore, raxofelast reduced pancreatic NF-κB activation and the TNF-α mRNA levels and tissue content of mature protein in the <b>pancreas.</b> <b>Indeed,</b> lipid peroxidation inhibition might be considered a potential therapeutic approach to prevent the severe damage in acute pancreatitis...|$|R

Mice lacking the Mist 1 gene exhibit disorganized acinar cell structure, defective intercellular communication and acinar-to-ductal metaplasia. In this thesis, I explored novel functions of Mist 1 and studied the mechanisms by which Mist 1 exerts these functions in the exocrine pancreas. Expression of Mist 1 resulted in {{a significant decrease in}} the growth potential of cells, which was associated with induced expression of p 21 CIP 1 /WAF 1. In contrast, shRNA-directed knock-down of endogenous Mist 1 transcripts resulted in increased cell proliferation and a concomitant decrease in p 21 CIP 1 /WAF 1 protein levels. Increased cell proliferation was also found in Mist 1 KO pancreata. Mist 1 -dependent activation of the p 21 CIP 1 /WAF 1 promoter was independent of classic bHLH protein binding sites (E-box, CANNTG). Instead, Mist 1 activated p 21 CIP 1 /WAF 1 expression through the Sp 1 binding sites within the p 21 CIP 1 /WAF 1 promoter by directly binding to Sp 1. These results indicate that Mist 1 suppresses pancreatic acinar cell growth through induction of p 21 CIP 1 /WAF 1. Interestingly, in a MS/MS analysis designed to identify Mist 1 binding proteins in acinar cells, Mist 1 was found to associate with SAP 18, a subunit of the Sin 3 -HDAC corepressor complex. This leads to the possibility that Mist 1 also functions to repress transcription of certain genes in the exocrine <b>pancreas.</b> <b>Indeed,</b> transcript levels of Rnd 2 and K 19 negatively correlated with Mist 1 protein levels in pancreatic cell lines.

In the pituitary, lactotrophs are the cell population with the greatest increase in cell death, whereas in the hypothalamus and cerebellum astrocytes are most highly affected. Insulin treatment can delay, but does not prevent, diabetic complications. As ghrelin and growth hormone (GH) secretagogues are reported to prevent apoptosis in different tissues, and to modulate glucose homeostasis, a combined hormonal treatment may be beneficial. Hence, we analyzed the effect of insulin and GH-releasing peptide 6 (GHRP- 6) on diabetes-induced apoptosis in the pituitary, hypothalamus and cerebellum of diabetic rats. Adult male Wistar rats were made diabetic by streptozotocin injection (65 mg/kg) and divided into four groups from diabetes onset: those receiving a daily injection of saline (1 ml/kg/day), GHRP- 6 (150 μg/kg/day), insulin (1 - 8 U/day) or insulin plus GHRP- 6 for 8 weeks. Control non-diabetic rats received saline (1 ml/kg/day). Diabetes increased cell death in the pituitary, hypothalamus and cerebellum (P< 0. 05). In the pituitary, insulin treatment prevented diabetes-induced apoptosis (P< 0. 01), {{as well as the}} decline in prolactin and GH mRNA levels (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Redox {{reactions}} are {{an essential part}} of the cell’s metabolism, differentiation, and responses to the prevailing environmental conditions. In plants, dramatic changes in cellular redox status are observed upon exposure to environmental stresses, including pathogen attack. These changes affect the oxidative status of reactive cysteine thiols in regulatory proteins. To control oxidative protein modifications, plant cells employ the antioxidant enzymes S-nitrosoglutathione Reductase 1 (GSNOR 1) and members of the Thioredoxin (TRX) superfamily. Immune signalling by the hormone salicylic acid (SA) is particularly dependent on the activity of these enzymes. SA is synthesized in response to challenge by plant pathogens for the establishment of local and systemic immunity. SA accumulation is regulated by cellular levels of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), a redox molecule capable of S-nitrosylating proteins (i. e., covalent attachment of nitric oxide to cysteines). GSNOR 1 is thought to regulate cellular GSNO and global S-nitrosylation levels, but it is unknown how GSNOR 1 regulates SA biosynthesis. Furthermore, SA recruits the activities of selected TRX enzymes that act as ubiquitous thiol reductases to counteract cysteine oxidation of SA-responsive regulatory proteins, thereby modulating their activities. However, it is unclear how SA controls nuclear redox processes involved in SAresponsive gene activation. Here we show that GSNOR 1 regulates SA accumulation by regulating the expression of SA biosynthetic genes and their transcriptional activators. Moreover, we describe Nucleoredoxins (NRX) that represent novel, potentially nuclear localized members of the TRX superfamily. Mutant nrx 1 plants displayed enhanced disease resistance, which was associated with enhanced expression of genes involved in synthesis of salicylic acid. Unlike classical TRX, NRX enzymes contain multiple active sites, suggesting they may exhibit significant reductase or remodelling activities. <b>Indeed,</b> <b>insulin</b> turbidity assays indicated that NRX proteins show an unusual form of disulphide reduction activity.

Blockade of IL- 1 β improves T 2 D, pointing on a major role for IL- 1 β {{in the development and}} T 2 D. While the deleterious role of chronic activation of the IL- 1 system in T 2 D is well documented, little is known about its potential physiological role(s). The aim of the present study is to reveal the physiological role of inflammation and specifically of IL- 1 β in metabolism. In vivo acutely administered IL- 1 β dose dependently induced insulin secretion even at IL- 1 β concentrations in the circulation that are below the detection limit. Together with glucose IL- 1 β promotes insulin secretion via parasympathetic nerve stimulation. In vitro IL- 1 β had a dual effect on glucose stimulated insulin secretion: it was beneficial at low doses and deleterious at high doses. The endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) strongly induced IL- 1 β, stimulated insulin secretion and improved glucose tolerance. Interestingly, the improvement of glucose tolerance was not only a consequence of increased insulin levels but was also due to direct IL- 1 β mediated glucose uptake into various tissues. One of the compartments responding to IL- 1 β with elevated glucose uptake was the cells of the immune system, mainly macrophages. We further show that macrophages significantly contribute to IL- 1 β mediated glucose disposal from the circulation. In addition, this work provides evidence for a role of insulin in mounting an immune response. <b>Indeed,</b> <b>insulin</b> increased the secretion of IL- 1 β via the NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP 3) inflammasome preferentially in inflammatory M 1 macrophages but not from alternatively activated M 2 macrophages.

This method was compared with HPLC method using a mobile phase composed of water with 0. 1 % formic acid / acetonitrile with 0. 1 % formic acid in gradient mode. Secondly a MEKC method was also optimized to analyze protamine peptides in insulin formulations. The major protamine peptides could be separated using a BGE made of 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 2) with 50 mM Thesit®. This method was used to check conformity of protamine in commercially available formulations. Finally, different approaches were investigated in order to follow <b>insulin</b> aggregation. <b>Indeed,</b> <b>insulin</b> is prone to unfold when submitted to denaturating factors as temperature, ionic strength, agitation and pH. An accumulation of unfolds protein in bloodstream results in a high tendency to aggregate and form amyloid fibrils. A deposit of those fibrils in the subcutaneous tissue leads to a complication called “insulin-derived amyloidosis”. On the other hand, during its production, insulin is often subjected to extreme conditions making aggregation, as well as protein stability, important parameters to be controlled during its quality control. In this study, insulin aggregates were generated after optimization of incubation conditions (pH, temperature, agitation…). Those aggregates were then analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE). We showed that capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) is a promising technique to analyze covalent aggregates of insulin due to the fact that it separates the aggregates according to their size and not to their size/charge ratio. The use of a laser-induced fluorescence detector was also found attractive to enhance the sensitivity of the method...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{tyrosine}} phosphatase 1 B (PTP 1 B) is a ubiquitously expressed tyrosine phosphatase {{implicated in}} the central control of energy homeostasis via negative regulation of leptin signaling. Mice with central nervous system (CNS) -specific PTP 1 B deficiency demonstrate clear metabolic improvements, including decreased body weight and adiposity presumably due to enhanced leptin sensitivity. Interestingly, compound PTP 1 B:leptin double mutants show attenuated weight gain compared to leptin single mutants, suggesting that the metabolic effects of PTP 1 B deficiency may also involve non-leptin signaling pathways. <b>Indeed,</b> <b>insulin</b> and other non-leptin cytokines, such as interleukin- 6, have been {{implicated in the}} CNS control of energy balance, and these pathways are also candidates of PTP 1 B regulation. Thus, {{whether or not the}} metabolic effects of PTP 1 B deficiency are due exclusively to enhanced leptin signaling remains unclear. This dissertation examines the role of central PTP 1 B in the control of leptin receptor-dependent energy homeostasis. A leptin receptor-expressing cell specific PTP 1 B-deficient (LepRb PTP 1 B /) mouse model was generated and its metabolic phenotype was analyzed in comparison to wildtype controls and to whole body PTP 1 B knockouts. Though subtle phenotypic differences between LepRb-PTP 1 B-/- and PTP 1 B-/- mice exist, LepRb-PTP 1 B-/- mice demonstrate a majority of the phenotype observed in whole body PTP 1 B knockouts, including decreased body weight and adiposity and improved leptin sensitivity compared to wildtype controls. To further elucidate whether or not central PTP 1 B regulates non-leptin signaling pathways, a compound hypothalamic PTP 1 B:LepRb double mutant (Nkx 2. 1 -PTP 1 B-/-:LepRb-/-) was generated and metabolically phenotyped in comparison to hypothalamic leptin receptor (Nkx 2. 1 -LepRb-/-) and PTP 1 B (Nkx 2. 1 -PTP 1 B-/-) mutant mice. While Nkx 2. 1 -PTP 1 B-/- mice show decreased body weight and adiposity compared to wildtypes, both Nkx 2. 1 -PTP 1 B-/-:LepRb /- and Nkx 2. 1 -LepRb-/- show a severe obese phenotype marked by similarly increased weight gain, total fat mass, food intake, and glucose intolerance, indicating that the metabolic benefits of hypothalamic PTP 1 B deficiency are dependent upon functional leptin receptor signaling. Finally, whether PTP 1 B can regulate interleukin- 6 signaling was explored using an immortalized mouse hypothalamic cell line. In summary, these data show that PTP 1 B is a critical regulator of energy balance within leptin receptor-expressing cells and within the hypothalamus specifically, and further begin to unravel the signaling pathways mediating the beneficial metabolic effects of central PTP 1 B deficiency. ...|$|R

In this study, we have isolated a protein from primary epididymal adipocytes with an apparent molecular weight of 125, 000. This protein exhibited immunoreactivity, in an insulin-dependent manner, with a phosphospecific antibody raised against the protein kinase B substrate consensus sequence RXRXX(pS/pT) as well as a phosphospecific antibody that recognizes serine 21 / 9 of GSK- 3 α/β. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry revealed the protein to be ATP-citrate lyase, suggesting that the two phosphospecific antibodies recognize phosphoserine 454, a previously reported insulin- and isoproterenol-stimulated ATP-citrate lyase phosphorylation site. <b>Indeed,</b> both <b>insulin</b> and isoproterenol stimulated the phosphorylation of this protein on the site recognized by the phosphospecific antibodies in a wortmannin-sensitive and -insensitive manner, respectively. In addition, transient expression of a constitutively active protein kinase B in primary adipocytes mimicked the effect of insulin on ATP-citrate lyase phosphorylation. Furthermore, ATP-citrate lyase was phosphorylated in vitro by recombinant protein kinase B on the same site. Taken together, these results demonstrate that serine 454 of ATP-citrate lyase is a novel and major in vivo substrate for protein kinase B...|$|R

Consistent with its expression throughout the endocrine pancreas, we now show that the promoter of the miR- 375 gene shows selective activity in pancreatic endocrine alpha cells, comparable to that observed in beta cells. We previously identified a novel negative regulatory element located downstream of the miR- 375 gene transcription start site. By generating luciferase reporter genes, we now show that the sequence is functional also when positioned upstream of a heterologous promoter, thus proving that the repressor effect is mediated at least in part at the level of transcription. Further characterization of the transcriptional control mechanism regulating expression of miR- 375 and other pancreatic miRNAs will contribute to a better understanding of pancreas development and function. 1...|$|R

The decrease in insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells {{and the increase}} of glucagon secretion by pancreatic beta cells, are the two major pathophysiologic characteristics. The majority of type 2 diabetics will therefore require insulin {{in the evolution of}} their disease, with weight gain and hypoglycaemia as side effects.

Complexes of peptides with chaperones induce peptide-directed immunity. Here we analyzed the interaction of (pre) proinsulin with the best characterized chaperone of the hsp 70 family, bacterial DnaK. Results Of a set of overlapping 13 -mer peptides of human preproinsulin high affinity binding to DnaK was found for the signal peptide and one further region in each proinsulin domain (A- and B-chain, C-peptide).

40|$|Background: Islets from adult rat possess weak {{antioxidant}} defense {{leading to}} unbalance between superoxide dismutase (SOD) and hydrogen peroxide-inactivating enzymatic activities, catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) rending them susceptible to oxidative stress. We {{have shown that}} this vulnerability is influenced by maternal diet during gestation and lactation. Methodology/Principal Findings: The present study investigated if low antioxidant activity in islets is already observed at birth and if maternal protein restriction influences the development of islet antioxidant defenses. Rats were fed a control diet (C group) or a low protein diet during gestation (LP) or until weaning (LPT), after which offspring received the control diet. We found that antioxidant enzymatic activities varied with age. At birth and after weaning, normal islets possessed an efficient GPX activity. However, the antioxidant capacity decreased thereafter increasing the potential vulnerability to oxidative stress. Maternal protein malnutrition changed the antioxidant enzymatic activities in islets of the progeny. At 3 months, SOD activity was increased in LP and LPT islets with no concomitant activation of CAT and GPX. This unbalance could lead to higher hydrogen peroxide production, which may concur to oxidative stress causing defective insulin gene expression due to modification of critical factors that modulate the insulin promoter.

40|$|There is {{widespread}} anecdotal evidence that growth hormone (GH) {{is used by}} athletes for its anabolic and lipolytic properties. Although {{there is little evidence}} that GH improves performance in young healthy adults, randomized controlled studies carried out so far are inadequately designed to demonstrate this, not least because GH is often abused in combination with anabolic steroids and insulin. Some of the anabolic actions of GH are mediated through the generation of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), and it is believed that this is also being abused. Athletes are exposing themselves to potential harm by self-administering large doses of GH, IGF-I and insulin. The effects of excess GH are exemplified by acromegaly. IGF-I may mediate and cause some of these changes, but in addition, IGF-I may lead to profound hypoglycaemia, as <b>indeed</b> can <b>insulin.</b> Although GH is on the World Anti-doping Agency list of banned substances, the detection of abuse with GH is challenging. Two approaches have been developed to detect GH abuse. The first is based on an assessment of the effect of exogenous recombinant human GH on pituitary GH isoforms and the second is based on the measurement of markers of GH action. As a result, GH abuse can be detected with reasonable sensitivity and specificity. Testing for IGF-I and insulin is in its infancy, but the measurement of markers of GH action may also detect IGF-I usage, while urine mass spectroscopy has begun to identify the use of insulin analogue...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{pancreas}} {{derives from}} {{cells in the}} ventral and dorsal foregut endoderm that express the transcription factor Pdx- 1. These specified cells give rise to the precursors of the endocrine, ductal, and exocrine pancreatic cells. The identification of transcription factors that regulate the onset of Pdx- 1 expression is therefore essential to understand pancreas development. No such factor that acts both in the ventral and in the dorsal endoderm is known. We showed previously that the Onecut transcription factor HNF- 6 promotes differentiation of the endocrine cell precursors in which it stimulates expression of the proendocrine gene Ngn- 3. By analyzing the phenotype of HNF- 6 null mice, we now demonstrate that HNF- 6 also controls an earlier step in <b>pancreas</b> development. <b>Indeed,</b> the <b>pancreas</b> of Hnf 6 −/− mice was hypoplastic. This did not result from decreased proliferation or from increased apoptosis, but from retarded pancreatic specification of endodermal cells. The onset of Pdx- 1 expression was delayed both in the ventral and in the dorsal endoderm, leading {{to a reduction in}} the number of endodermal cells expressing Pdx- 1 at the time of pancreatic budding. In normal embryos, HNF- 6 was detected in the endoderm prior to the expression of Pdx- 1. Moreover, HNF- 6 could directly stimulate the Pdx 1 promoter. Our data therefore identify HNF- 6 as the first factor known to control Pdx- 1 expression both in the ventral and in the dorsal endoderm. We conclude that HNF- 6 controls the timing of pancreas specification and that HNF- 6 acts upstream of Pdx- 1 in this developmental process. Together with the known role of HNF- 6 in pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation, our data point to HNF- 6 as a key regulator of pancreas development...|$|R

Our previous findings suggested that, {{in addition to}} PKA activation, another cAMP-dependent mechanism is involved in TSH action. In this work, we assess whether the newly identified cAMP-Epac-Rap 1 cascade is involved in TSH-cAMP-mediated effects in dog thyroid cells. We first demonstrate that TSH and forskolin strongly activate Rap 1 in a PKA-independent manner. However, activation of Rap 1 is not specific for TSH or cAMP. <b>Indeed,</b> carbachol, TPA, <b>insulin,</b> or EGF, which activate different cAMP-independent cascades, all independently activate Rap 1. Rap 1 is therefore a common step in all these cascades which exert various effects on proliferation, differentiation, and function of thyroid cells. Moreover, the microinjection of the Rap 1 protein alone or {{in combination with the}} catalytic C subunit of PKA fails to induce proliferation or expression of thyroglobulin.

These islet-like cell clusters were transplanted beneath the kidney capsule to either normoglycaemic or alloxan-treated nude mice. The grafts consistently failed to cure the alloxan-treated mice immediately after implantation, however, normoglycaemia was restored in {{a majority of the}} mice within 2 months after transplantation and in all animals after 4 and 6 months. <b>Indeed,</b> the <b>insulin</b> released from the transplanted fetal Beta cells was able to normalize the serum glucose concentration at porcine levels (4 - 5 mmol/l) rather than at the level maintained in mice (8 - 10 mmol/l). In the cured mice there was a normal secretory response to glucose in the grafts as evidenced by normal glucose profiles during intravenous glucose tolerance test and a biphasic insulin response to high glucose when perfusing the graft bearing kidney. On the other hand, in the normoglycaemic animals the second phase faded before the glucose stimulus had been withdrawn. Two months after transplantation the endocrine cells were arranged so that the endocrine non-Beta cells were randomly scattered among a majority of Beta cells. The cell replication of the Beta cells, measured by 3 H-thymidine incorporation, was within the lower range of that seen in the native islets of adult mice. No major differences between the controls and the alloxan-treated animals were observed in this respect. Cultured islet-like cell clusters had high rates of glucose utilization, paralleled by low rates of glucose oxidation, compared with adult mouse islets.

40|$|Insulin receptors {{are widely}} {{distributed}} in the kidney and affect multiple aspects of renal function. In the proximal tubule, insulin regulates volume and acid-base regulation through stimulation of the Na(+) /H(+) exchanger NHE 3. This paper characterizes the signaling pathway by which insulin stimulates NHE 3 in a cell culture model [opossum kidney (OK) cell]. Insulin has two distinct phases of action on NHE 3. Chronic insulin (24 h) activates NHE 3 through the classic phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase-serum- and glucocorticoid-dependent kinase 1 (PI 3 K-SGK 1) pathway as insulin stimulates SGK 1 phosphorylation and the insulin effect can be blocked by the PI 3 K inhibitor wortmannin or a dominant-negative SGK 1. We showed that SGK 1 transcript and protein are expressed in rat proximal tubule and OK cells. We previously showed that glucocorticoids augment the effect of insulin on NHE 3 (Klisic J, Hu MC, Nief V, Reyes L, Fuster D, Moe OW, Ambuhl PM. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 283 : F 532 -F 539, 2002). Part {{of this can be}} mediated via induction of SGK 1 by glucocorticoids, and <b>indeed</b> the <b>insulin</b> effect on NHE 3 can also be amplified by overexpression of SGK 1. We next addressed the acute effect of insulin (1 - 2 h) on NHE 3 by systematically examining the candidate signaling cascades and activation mechanisms of NHE 3. We ruled out the PI 3 K-SGK 1 -Akt and TC 10 pathways, increased surface NHE 3, NHE 3 phosphorylation, NHE 3 association with calcineurin homologous protein 1 or megalin as mechanisms of acute activation of NHE 3 by insulin. In summary, insulin stimulates NHE 3 acutely via yet undefined pathways and mechanisms. The chronic effect of insulin is mediated by the classic PI 3 K-SGK 1 route...|$|R
