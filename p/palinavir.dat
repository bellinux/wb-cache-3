40|$|<b>Palinavir</b> is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) and type 2 (HIV- 2) proteases. Replication of laboratory strains (HIV- 1, HIV- 2, and simian immunodeficiency virus) and HIV- 1 clinical isolates is inhibited by <b>palinavir</b> with 50 % effective concentrations ranging from 0. 5 to 30 nM. The average cytotoxic concentration of <b>palinavir</b> (35 microM) in the various target cells indicates a favorable therapeutic index. Potent antiviral activity is retained with increased doses of virus and with clinical isolates resistant to zidovudine (AZT), didanosine (ddI), or nevirapine. Combinations of <b>palinavir</b> with either AZT, ddI, or nevirapine demonstrate synergy or additivity in the inhibition of HIV- 1 replication. <b>Palinavir</b> retains anti-HIV- 1 activity when administered postinfection until times subsequent to the reverse transcription step. In chronically infected CR- 10 cells, <b>palinavir</b> blocks Gag precursor polyprotein processing completely, reducing greater than 99 % of infectious particle production. The {{results indicate that the}} antiviral activity of <b>palinavir</b> is specific to inhibition of the viral protease and occurs at a late stage in the replicative cycle of HIV- 1. On the basis of the potent in vitro activity, low-level cytotoxicity, and other data, <b>palinavir</b> was selected for in-depth preclinical evaluation...|$|E
40|$|In {{eukaryotic}} cells, {{protein synthesis}} is regulated {{by a set}} of initiation factors (eIF) that are required for recruiting the 40 S ribosomal subunit onto the mRNA molecule. Among these proteins, eIF 4 GI, which is targeted by picornaviral proteases, makes a bridge between the mRNA cap structure (via eIF 4 E) and the 40 S ribosome (via eIF 3). Recently, internal ribosome entry segment (IRES) elements have been characterized in the genomic RNA of both simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1), suggesting that viral expression of these two viruses can be regulated at the translational level. Thus, by analogy with members of the picornavirus family, we have investigated the action of the HIV- 1 protease on initiation factors eIF 4 GI and eIF 4 GII using cell extracts and the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. Our results show that eIF 4 GI, but not eIF 4 GII, is substrate for HIV- 1 protease and this effect can be prevented by a HIV- 1 protease inhibitor, <b>palinavir.</b> However, in contrast to picornaviral proteases, the cleavage of eIF 4 GI by HIV- 1 protease occurs at multiple sites and impairs translation of both cap-dependent and IRES-containing RNAs, except for the HCV IRES, which does not require eIF 4 GI or eIF 4 GII for activity...|$|E
