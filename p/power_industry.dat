5|$|In 2002, about 97% of air {{pollution}}, 86% {{of total}} waste and 23% of water pollution in Estonia {{came from the}} <b>power</b> <b>industry,</b> which uses oil shale as the main resource for its power production.|$|E
5|$|In the U.S., {{the wind}} <b>power</b> <b>industry</b> has {{recently}} increased its lobbying efforts considerably, spending about $5 million in 2009 {{after years of}} relative obscurity in Washington. By comparison, the U.S. nuclear industry alone spent over $650 million on its lobbying efforts and campaign contributions during a single ten-year period ending in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the wind}} <b>power</b> <b>industry</b> was {{affected}} by the global financial crisis in 2009 and 2010, GWEC predicts that the installed capacity of wind power will be 792.1 GW {{by the end of}} 2020 and 4,042 GW by end of 2050. The increased commissioning of wind power is being accompanied by record low prices for forthcoming renewable electric power. In some cases, wind onshore is already the cheapest electric power generation option and costs are continuing to decline. The contracted prices for wind onshore {{for the next few years}} are now as low as 30 USD/MWh.|$|E

5|$|Just {{as there}} is a need for tax shifting, there is also a need for subsidy shifting. Subsidies are not an {{inherently}} bad thing as many technologies and industries emerged through government subsidy schemes. The Stern Review explains that of 20 key innovations from the past 30years, only one of the 14 was funded entirely by the private sector and nine were totally publicly funded. In terms of specific examples, the Internet was the result of publicly funded links among computers in government laboratories and research institutes. And the combination of the federal tax deduction and a robust state tax deduction in California helped to create the modern wind <b>power</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E
5|$|Large {{stockpiles}} of weapons-grade plutonium were built up {{by both the}} Soviet Union and the United States during the Cold War. The U.S. reactors at Hanford and the Savannah River Site in South Carolina produced 103tonnes, and an estimated 170tonnes of military-grade plutonium was produced in the USSR. Each year about 20tonnes of the element is still produced as a by-product of the nuclear <b>power</b> <b>industry.</b> As much as 1000tonnes of plutonium may be in storage with more than 200tonnes of that either inside or extracted from nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|Mining {{oil shale}} {{involves}} {{a number of}} environmental impacts, more pronounced in surface mining than in underground mining. These include acid drainage induced by the sudden rapid exposure and subsequent oxidation of formerly buried materials, the introduction of metals including mercury into surface-water and groundwater, increased erosion, sulfur-gas emissions, and air pollution caused by the production of particulates during processing, transport, and support activities. In 2002, about 97% of air pollution, 86% of total waste and 23% of water pollution in Estonia came from the <b>power</b> <b>industry,</b> which uses oil shale as the main resource for its power production.|$|E

5|$|Suomen Gummitehdas Oy {{was founded}} in 1898 and began {{manufacturing}} car tyres in 1932. The Hakkapeliitta tyre name was introduced in 1936, and some tyres sold under the Nokian tyre name still use the Hakkapeliitta brand name. Hakkapeliitta is a (Finnish) historical term used for a Finnish light cavalryman {{in the service of}} King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden during the Thirty Years' War (1618–48). In 1967, Suomen Kumitehdas Oy (originally called Suomen Gummitehdas Oy) merged with Suomen Kaapelitehdas (Finnish Cable Works) and the forest and <b>power</b> <b>industry</b> company Nokia Aktiebolag to create Nokia Corporation.|$|E
5|$|The oil shale-fired {{electrical}} <b>power</b> <b>industry</b> {{started in}} 1924 when the Tallinn Power Station switched to oil shale. In 1933, it reached {{a capacity of}} 22megawatts (MW). Other oil shale-fired power stations were built in Püssi (3.7MW), Kohtla (3.7MW), Kunda (2.3MW), and Kiviõli (0.8MW). At the beginning of World War II, the total capacity of oil shale-fired power stations was 32.5MW. Only the Tallinn and Püssi power stations were connected to the grid.|$|E
5|$|This was at {{odds with}} the Eisenhower administration's Atoms for Peace program, and {{resulted}} in pressure on federal officials to develop a civilian nuclear <b>power</b> <b>industry</b> that could help justify the government's considerable expenditures on the nuclear weapons program. In 1953 the Atomic Energy Commission presented a set of draft amendments to the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy for consideration. After some debate, this resulted in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.|$|E

5|$|A {{committee}} {{appointed by}} the Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, and chaired by Keith Murray, recommended in 1957 that a medical school be established at Kensington. Its creation, followed by that of a Faculty of Arts, prompted the university to change {{its name to the}} University of New South Wales (UNSW) in 1958. Baxter established a number of unusual schools. He created a School of Nuclear Engineering in anticipation that a nuclear <b>power</b> <b>industry</b> would be established in Australia. He also created schools of Textile Technology, Wool Technology, Food Technology and Highway Engineering and Traffic Engineering. The School of Business Administration and an Institute of Administration was established in 1960, and ultimately the Australian Graduate School of Management in 1969. When the Faculty of Arts was created, he insisted that all Arts students take at least one science subject.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in the Austrian Empire, Tesla {{received}} an advanced education in engineering and physics in the 1870s and gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric <b>power</b> <b>industry.</b> He emigrated to the United States in 1884, where he would become a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company would eventually market.|$|E
5|$|The 1789 {{discovery}} of uranium in the mineral pitchblende is credited to Martin Heinrich Klaproth, who named the new element after the planet Uranus. Eugène-Melchior Péligot {{was the first}} person to isolate the metal and its radioactive properties were discovered in 1896 by Henri Becquerel. Research by Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, Enrico Fermi and others, such as J. Robert Oppenheimer starting in 1934 led to its use as a fuel in the nuclear <b>power</b> <b>industry</b> and in Little Boy, the first nuclear weapon used in war. An ensuing arms race during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union produced tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that used uranium metal and uranium-derived plutonium-239. The security of those weapons and their fissile material following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 is an ongoing concern for public health and safety. See Nuclear proliferation.|$|E

The municipality has more high and middle income jobs, and fewer low income jobs, than the national average. Today {{the majority of the}} largest companies in the municipality are in the sectors of trade, transport and media. The wind <b>power</b> <b>industry</b> has strong roots in Aarhus, and the larger region of Midtjylland, and nationally most of the revenue in the industry is generated by companies in the greater Aarhus area. The wind industry employs about a thousand people within the municipality making it a central component in the local economy. The biotech industry is well established in the city with many small and medium-sized companies mainly focused on research and development.|$|E
5|$|The wind <b>power</b> <b>industry</b> set new {{records in}} 2014 – more than 50 GW of new {{capacity}} was installed. Another record breaking year occurred in 2015, with 22% annual market growth {{resulting in the}} 60 GW mark being passed. In 2015, close to half of all new wind power was added outside of the traditional markets in Europe and North America. This was largely from new construction in China and India. Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) figures show that 2015 recorded an increase of installed capacity of more than 63 GW, taking the total installed wind energy capacity to 432.9 GW, up from 74 GW in 2006.
