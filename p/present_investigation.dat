The multiple-slat flaps did not give significantly higher lift coefficients than the single-slat (Fowler) flap and gave considerably greater pitching-moment coefficients. It appears, however, that improvement in high-lift characteristics could be obtained with the use of more highly cambered thick slats than with those of the <b>present</b> <b>investigation.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In 1908, Hermann Minkowski {{presented}} a paper consolidating {{the role of}} time as the fourth dimension of spacetime, the basis for Einstein's theories of special and general relativity. But the geometry of spacetime, being non-Euclidean, is profoundly different from that popularised by Hinton. The study of Minkowski space required new mathematics quite {{different from that of}} four-dimensional Euclidean space, and so developed along quite different lines. This separation was less clear in the popular imagination, with works of fiction and philosophy blurring the distinction, so in 1973 H. S. M. Coxeter felt compelled to write: Little, if anything, is gained by representing the fourth Euclidean dimension as time. In fact, this idea, so attractively developed by H. G. Wells in The Time Machine, has led such authors as John William Dunne (An Experiment with Time)into a serious misconception of the theory of Relativity. Minkowski's geometry of space-time is not Euclidean, and consequently has no connection with the <b>present</b> <b>investigation.</b> H. S. M. Coxeter ...|$|E
