40|$|We {{present a}} pin-assignment {{algorithm}} {{based on a}} new multi-layer chip-level global router. Combining <b>pin</b> <b>assignment</b> and global routing {{has been an important}} approach for the pin-assignment problem. But there are many difficulties when combining the two processes. In the past, only specialized global routing methods were used in the combined process. In our <b>pin</b> <b>assignment</b> program, we use an actual global routing algorithm. To meet the requirement of <b>pin</b> <b>assignment</b> while keeping the routing quality, we dynamically adjust the weights in the routing graph during the routing stage. In addition, the multi-layer technology has introduced new challenges for the pin-assignment problem. Our algorithm can also handle the modern technology to provide <b>pin</b> <b>assignment</b> for multi-layer layouts. To our knowledge, no other <b>pin</b> <b>assignment</b> program can handle multi-layer layout. Tests on industrial circuits show that our pin-assignment algorithm is quite effective at reducing the demand for routing resource [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{algorithm}} which combines the <b>pin</b> <b>assignment</b> step {{and the global}} routing step in the physical design of VLSI circuits. Our algorithm is based on two key theorems: the channel <b>pin</b> <b>assignment</b> theorem and the block boundary decomposition theorem. These two theorems enable us to deal successfully with the high complexity resulting from combining the <b>pin</b> <b>assignment</b> and global routing steps. According to these two theorems, we only need to generate a coarse <b>pin</b> <b>assignment</b> and global routing solution. The exact pin locations and global routing topology can be determined optimally later by a linear time algorithm. We implemented a <b>pin</b> <b>assignment</b> and global routing package named BeauticianGR based on the proposed algorithm.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new pseudo <b>pin</b> <b>assignment</b> algorithm for crosstalk noise control in multi-layer gridless general -area routing. It {{also tends to}} minimize the number of vias needed in detailed routing. Our approach consists of two steps: coarse pseudo <b>pin</b> <b>assignment</b> and detailed pseudo <b>pin</b> <b>assignment.</b> Coarse pseudo <b>pin</b> <b>assignment</b> uses the crosstalk noise constraints to estimate the spacing requirements for each pseudo pin and minimizes the number of vias. Detailed pseudo <b>pin</b> <b>assignment</b> determines the exact locations of pseudo pins with proper spacings to satisfy the crosstalk noise constraints. 1. INTRODUCTION As VLSI technology advances, the minimum feature sizes of VLSI circuits are exponentially scaled down (from 250 nm in 1997 to 70 nm in 2009). On the other hand, the chip areas of VLSI systems are increased (from 300 mm 2 to 620 mm 2 respectively) [1]. These trends have the following impacts. First, devices are smaller and faster, but interconnects are more resistive with larg [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Multi-FPGA {{systems have}} {{tremendous}} potential, providing a high-performance computing substrate for many different applications. One {{of the keys}} to achieving this potential is a complete, automatic mapping solution that creates high-quality mappings in the shortest possible time. In this paper we consider one step in this process, the assignment of inter-FPGA signals to specific I/O pins on the FPGAs in a multi-FPGA system. We show that this problem can neither be handled by <b>pin</b> <b>assignment</b> methods developed for other applications nor standard routing algorithms. Although current mapping systems ignore this issue, we show that an intelligent <b>pin</b> <b>assignment</b> method can achieve both quality and mapping speed improvements over random approaches. Intelligent <b>pin</b> <b>assignment</b> methods already exist for multi-FPGA systems, but are restricted to topologies where logic-bearing FPGAs cannot be directly connected.
