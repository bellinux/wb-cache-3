5|$|Aeronautical {{engineering}} {{firms were}} quick {{to respond to the}} Comet's commercial advantages and technical flaws alike; other aircraft manufacturers learned from, and profited by, the hard-earned lessons embodied by de Havilland's Comet. While the Comet's buried engines were used on some other early jet airliners, such as the Tupolev Tu-104, later aircraft, such as the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8, would differ by employing <b>podded</b> engines held on pylons beneath the wings. Boeing stated that <b>podded</b> engines were selected for their passenger airliners because buried engines carried a higher risk of catastrophic wing failure in the event of engine fire. In response to the Comet tragedies, manufacturers also developed various means of pressurisation testing, often {{going so far as to}} explore rapid depressurisation; subsequent fuselage skins were of a greater thickness than the skin of the Comet.|$|E
5|$|The Comet 5 was {{proposed}} as {{an improvement over}} previous models, including a wider fuselage with five-abreast seating, a wing with greater sweep and <b>podded</b> Rolls-Royce Conway engines.

On the B-52D, the pilots and electronic countermeasures (EDM) operator ejected upwards, while the lower deck crew ejected downwards; until the B-52G, the gunner had to jettison the tail gun to bail out.|$|E

5|$|The Comet was {{powered by}} {{two pairs of}} {{turbojet}} engines buried in the wings close to the fuselage. Chief designer Bishop chose the Comet's embedded-engine configuration because it avoided the drag of <b>podded</b> engines and allowed for a smaller fin and rudder, since the hazards of asymmetric thrust were reduced. The engines were outfitted with baffles to reduce noise emissions, and extensive soundproofing was also implemented to improve passenger conditions.|$|E
5|$|Thrust is {{provided}} by four Rolls-Royce Mermaid azimuth thruster type <b>podded</b> propulsion units, each featuring one forward-facing low-vibration propeller with separately bolted blades.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{evaluate}} genetic variations in yield and reproductive developmental characters among peanut genotypes in response to drought and relate these responses to <b>pod</b> yield under different soil moisture. Eleven peanut genotypes were tested under three soil moisture levels [field capacity (FC), 2 / 3 available soil water (AW) and 1 / 3 AW] in field experiments. Data were recorded for number of flowers, pegs (RSs), immature <b>pods</b> and mature <b>pods</b> per plant, seed per <b>pod,</b> 100 -seed weight and <b>pod</b> yield at harvest. A drought tolerance index (DTI) for <b>pod</b> yield was calculated as the ratio of <b>pod</b> yield under stress treatment to that under well-watered conditions. The differences among water regimes were significant for <b>pod</b> yield, number of RSs, immature <b>pods</b> and mature <b>pods</b> per plant, seed per <b>pod</b> and 100 seed weight and differences among genotypes were significant for all traits. Drought reduced <b>pod</b> yield, number of RSs, <b>pods</b> and mature <b>pods</b> per plant. Early peak of flowering is important for the formation of mature <b>pods</b> under drought conditions. Two different strategies were used in maintaining high <b>pod</b> yield under drought. High yield potential was important for ICGV 98348 and ICGV 98353, whereas low <b>pod</b> yield reduction was important for ICGV 98305, ICGV 98303 and ICGV 98300.

25|$|Plans {{were first}} drawn up in April 1939, and the {{original}} design {{was very different from}} the aircraft that eventually entered service, with wing root-mounted engines, rather than <b>podded</b> ones, when submitted in June 1939. The progression of the original design was delayed greatly by technical issues involving the new jet engine. Because the engines were slow to arrive, Messerschmitt moved the engines from the wing roots to underwing pods, allowing them to be changed more readily if needed; this {{would turn out to be}} important, both for availability and maintenance. Since the BMW 003 jets proved heavier than anticipated, the wing was swept slightly, by 18.5°, to accommodate a change in the center of gravity. Funding for the jet engine program was also initially lacking as many high-ranking officials thought the war could easily be won with conventional aircraft. Among those were Hermann Göring, head of the Luftwaffe, who cut the engine development program to just 35 engineers in February 1940 (the month before the first wooden mock-up was completed); Willy Messerschmitt, who desired to maintain mass production of the piston-powered, 1935-origin Bf 109 and the projected Me 209; and Major General Adolf Galland, who had initially supported Messerschmitt through the early development years, flying the Me 262 himself on 22 April 1943. By that time, problems with engine development had slowed production of the aircraft considerably. One particularly acute problem arose with the lack of an alloy with a melting point high enough to endure the high temperatures involved, a problem that by the end of the war had not been adequately resolved. The aircraft made its first successful flight entirely on jet power on 18 July 1942, powered by a pair of Jumo 004 engines, after a November 1941 flight (with BMW 003s) ended in a double flameout.|$|E
500|$|A {{symposium}} titled [...] "Supersonic-Transport Implications" [...] was {{hosted by}} the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1960. Various views were put forward on the likely type of powerplant for a supersonic transport, such as <b>podded</b> or buried installation and turbojet or ducted-fan engines. Boundary layer management in the <b>podded</b> installation was put forward as simpler with only an inlet cone but Dr. Seddon of the RAE saw [...] "a future in a more sophisticated integration of shapes" [...] in a buried installation. Another concern highlighted the case with two or more engines [...] situated behind a single intake. An intake failure {{could lead to a}} double or triple engine failure. The advantage of the ducted fan over the turbojet was reduced airport noise but with considerable economic penalties with its larger cross-section producing excessive drag. At that time it was considered that the noise from a turbojet optimised for supersonic cruise could be reduced to an acceptable level using noise suppressors as used on subsonic jets.|$|E

By carefully positioning the wing in relation to the shock, the shock's high pressure could be captured {{on the bottom of the}} wing and generate additional lift. To take maximum advantage of this effect, they redesigned the underside of the aircraft to feature a large triangular intake area far forward of the engines, better positioning the shock in relation to the wing.
