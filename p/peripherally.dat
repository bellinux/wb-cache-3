5|$|Like the LP12, the Xerxes has a two-piece platter–sub-platter {{configuration}} {{on which}} sits a thin felt mat. And while the LP12's platters {{are made of}} mazak, the Xerxes' platters are of aluminium. The outer platter is rigid and <b>peripherally</b> weighted. However, the Roksan's outer platter weighs {{less than half of}} that of the LP12, to reduce load on the main bearing, yet is able to achieve a greater inertia because of its weight distribution.|$|E
5|$|Theoretically, any gas giant {{could be}} {{enclosed}} in a solid shell; {{at a certain}} radius the surface gravity would be terrestrial, and energy {{could be provided by}} tapping the thermal energy of the planet. This concept is explored <b>peripherally</b> in the novel Accelerando (and the short story Curator, which is incorporated into the novel as a chapter) by Charles Stross, in which Saturn is converted into a human-habitable world.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of Austria-Hungary in World War I and the Treaty of Rapallo of 1920, Rijeka became an {{independent}} city-state known as the Free State of Fiume. That {{marked the beginning of}} the port's decline, as it lost a large portion of its major market, Hungary. Italy annexed Rijeka in 1924 by the Treaty of Rome, and the port became <b>peripherally</b> located, with no modern railway or road links to the rest of the country, further adding to the already obvious economic decline.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Bear's Carnival (2006) revisits the trope of the single-gender world, {{as a pair}} of {{gay male}} ambassador-spies attempt to {{infiltrate}} and subvert the predominately lesbian civilization of New Amazonia, whose matriarchal rulers have all but enslaved their men. In 2007, J.K. Rowling's statement that Albus Dumbledore, a character in her Harry Potter series, was gay caused some controversy. Sarah Hall's dystopian novel The Carhullan Army (2007), published in the US under the title Daughters of the North, matter of factly features lesbians as primary characters. The novel won the 2007 John Llewellyn Rhys Prize and James Tiptree, Jr. Award, and was shortlisted for the 2008 Arthur C. Clarke Award. It is perhaps telling of the evolution of public perception of same sex relationships that the relationships are unmentioned or only <b>peripherally</b> noted in reviews.|$|E
5|$|HMS Havant was an H-class {{destroyer}} originally {{ordered by}} the Brazilian Navy with the name Javary in the late 1930s, but was bought by the Royal Navy after the beginning of World War II in September 1939. The ship was initially assigned to escort duties in the Western Approaches, but {{was transferred to the}} Home Fleet when the Norwegian Campaign began in April 1940. She was only <b>peripherally</b> involved in the campaign as she escorted ships carrying troops that occupied Iceland and the Faeroe Islands as well as convoys to Narvik. Havant was evacuating troops from Dunkirk when she was badly damaged by Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers on 1 June and had to be scuttled.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{possible}} pathophysiological mechanisms {{involved in the}} development and maintenance of obesity. This field of research had been almost unapproached until the leptin gene was discovered in 1994 by J. M. Friedman's laboratory. While leptin and ghrelin are produced <b>peripherally,</b> they control appetite through their actions on the central nervous system. In particular, they and other appetite-related hormones act on the hypothalamus, a region of the brain central to the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. There are several circuits within the hypothalamus that contribute to its role in integrating appetite, the melanocortin pathway being the most well understood. The circuit begins with an area of the hypothalamus, the arcuate nucleus, that has outputs to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), the brain's feeding and satiety centers, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin {{attracted}} the attention of Bartholomew Iscanus, Bishop of Exeter, who made him archdeacon at Totnes in about 1161, after Baldwin's father's death. Baldwin was known as a canon lawyer during his holding of Totnes. He received a letter from John of Salisbury in 1167, complaining about Bartholomew's conduct during the Becket controversy. John accused Bartholomew of not properly supporting Thomas Becket the Archbishop of Canterbury in his dispute with the king, urging Baldwin to influence the bishop to increase his support, and not to sign any appeal by the English bishops against Becket. Other letters from John dealt with rumours concerning Roger, the Bishop of Worcester, who John had heard was speaking badly of Becket. John's purpose seems to have been to have Baldwin pass along a warning from Becket to Roger about his behaviour; John was a supporter of Becket's during the latter's exile. In 1169 Baldwin was once again <b>peripherally</b> involved in the Becket dispute, when he objected to Becket's excommunication of a number of noblemen and clergy for opposing Becket's cause. Baldwin's objection was not so much that they were excommunicated, but that no warning had been given that such an action was contemplated.|$|E
5|$|Of all Brandenburg-Prussian territories, the Electorate of Brandenburg {{was among}} the most devastated {{at the end of the}} Thirty Years' War. Already before the war, the {{population}} density and wealth in the electorate had been low compared to other territories of the empire, and the war had destroyed 60 towns, 48 castles and about 5,000 villages. An average of 50% of the population was dead, in some regions only 10% survived. The rural population, due to deaths and flight to the towns, had dropped from 300,000 before the war to 75,000 thereafter. In the important towns of Berlin-Cölln and Frankfurt an der Oder, the population drop was one third and two third, respectively. Some of the territories gained after the war were likewise devastated: in Pomerania, only one third of the population survived, and Magdeburg, once among the wealthiest cities of the empire, was burned down with most of the population slain. Least hit were the Duchy of Prussia, which was only <b>peripherally</b> involved in the war, and Minden.|$|E
5|$|The {{addition}} of the extra docking port caused {{the adoption of the}} Almaz-derived twin-chamber propulsion system first used on Salyut 3 and 5, with the two engine nozzleseach producing 2.9kilonewtons of thrustmounted <b>peripherally</b> {{on either side of the}} aft port. Salyut 6 introduced a Unified Propulsion System, with both the engines and the station's control thrusters running on unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide, drawn from a common set of pressurized tanks, allowing the refueling capabilities of the visiting Progress tankers to be exploited to the maximum effect. The entire engine and fuel storage assembly was contained within an unpressurized bay at the rear of the station, which was the same diameter as the main pressurized compartment. However, the replacement of the Soyuz engine used on previous stations with the bay meant that the station kept a similar overall length to its predecessors. The main engines could not be fired if the rear docking port was in use, hence any orbital maneuvers during this time had to be performed by the visiting spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Urnula craterium {{was first}} {{described}} in 1822 by American botanist Lewis David de Schweinitz as Peziza craterium, {{based on a}} specimen found in North Carolina. The species {{first appeared in the}} scientific literature under its current name when Elias Magnus Fries described the new genus Urnula in 1849, and set Peziza craterium as the type species. In 1896, German mycologist Heinrich Rehm removed the species from Urnula – transferring it to the genus Geopyxis – and replaced the type species with Urnula terrestris, a <b>peripherally</b> related species. This restructuring resulted in a taxomically untenable situation in which the genus Urnula consisted of a single species with ambiguous resemblance to the original species (described by Fries) upon which the genus was based. According to Elsie Kupfer, who had written Rehm to clarify the rationale for his decision: Urnula craterium was placed with its related species under Geopyxis, because Geopyxis was established by Persoon before Urnula by Fries; and that in order to retain the genus Urnula, under which Saccardo had placed Podophacidium terrestre of Niessl, he (Rehm) restricted the genus to this latter fungus.|$|E
5|$|Returning to the 3rd Division, Dannatt planned two {{exercises}} at the British Army Training Unit Suffield in Canada. The first was, at the time, {{the largest}} exercise the Army had run {{since the end}} of the Cold War; the second only took place after Dannatt's tenure as commander had expired. Dannatt gave evidence as an expert witness in the trial of Radislav Krstić in relation to the Srebrenica massacre, shortly after which he was posted to Bosnia, where he served as deputy commander of NATO's Stabilisation Force in 2000. His tour, originally scheduled to last a full year was cut short when Sir Michael Willcocks took early retirement from the Army in order to become Black Rod. The resulting personnel changes to fill the vacancy meant that Dannatt was appointed Assistant Chief of the General Staff (ACGS) in April 2001. In September 2001, he was on a visit to British troops in Cyprus and watched the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks on television. As ACGS, he was <b>peripherally</b> involved in planning for the Army's subsequent involvement in Afghanistan and later Iraq, as well as standing in for the Chief of the General Staff (then Michael Walker) when Walker was unavailable. Dannatt was succeeded as ACGS by David Richards, to whom he had handed over command of 4th Armoured Brigade in 1996 and who later succeeded Dannatt as Chief of the General Staff.|$|E
25|$|Glucocorticoids {{could act}} centrally, {{as well as}} <b>peripherally,</b> {{to assist in the}} {{normalization}} of extracellular fluid volume by regulating body’s action to atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Centrally, glucocorticoids could inhibit dehydration induced water intake; <b>peripherally,</b> glucocorticoids could induce a potent diuresis.|$|E

25|$|In {{cases of}} shock, a central venous catheter, a <b>peripherally</b> {{inserted}} central catheter (PICC), venous cutdown or intraosseous infusion may be necessary.|$|E
25|$|In {{cases of}} diarrhea-predominate {{irritable}} bowel syndrome, opioids {{may be used}} to suppress diarrhea. Loperamide is a <b>peripherally</b> selective opioid available without a prescription used to suppress diarrhea.|$|E
25|$|Muscle relaxants (according to one study) {{were not}} advised for {{orthopedic}} conditions, but rather for neurological {{conditions such as}} spasticity in cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis. Dantrolene, although thought of primarily as a <b>peripherally</b> acting agent, is associated with CNS effects, whereas baclofen activity is strictly associated with the CNS.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{intravenous}} methods of drug delivery, known as vascular access devices. These include the winged infusion device, peripheral venous catheter, midline catheter, <b>peripherally</b> inserted central catheter (PICC), {{central venous catheter}} and implantable port. The devices have different applications regarding duration of chemotherapy treatment, method of delivery and types of chemotherapeutic agent.|$|E
25|$|Inhaled {{lidocaine}} {{can be used}} as a cough suppressor acting <b>peripherally</b> {{to reduce}} the cough reflex. This application can be implemented as a safety and comfort measure for patients who have to be intubated, as it reduces the incidence of coughing and any tracheal damage it might cause when emerging from anaesthesia.|$|E
25|$|Blood {{was drawn}} <b>peripherally</b> in a {{majority}} of patients, but a central line to jugular/subclavian/femoral veins {{may be used in}} 16 percent of women and 4 percent of men. Adverse reactions during apheresis were experienced in 20 percent of women and 8 percent of men, these adverse events primarily consisted of numbness/tingling, multiple line attempts, and nausea.|$|E
25|$|Gestalt {{psychology}} {{should not}} be confused with the gestalt therapy of Fritz Perls, which is only <b>peripherally</b> linked to gestalt psychology. A strictly gestalt psychology-based therapeutic method is Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy, developed by the German gestalt psychologist and psychotherapist Hans-Jürgen Walter and his colleagues in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Other countries, especially Italy, have seen similar developments.|$|E
25|$|Munthe {{tried to}} avoid {{prescription}} medication for his psychological cases whenever possible, often recommending hypnosis, music, and other alternative medical approaches. He was <b>peripherally</b> involved in Louis Pasteur's search for a rabies vaccine. He advocated euthanasia for hopeless medical situations such as rabies, where the patient is condemned to a prospect of intense pain and mental anguish.|$|E
25|$|Injection: Clinical {{doses of}} {{oxytocin}} {{is given by}} injection either into a muscle or into a vein to cause contraction of the uterus. Very small amounts (< 1%) do appear to enter {{the central nervous system}} in humans when <b>peripherally</b> administered. The compound has a half-life of typically about three minutes in the blood when given intravenously.|$|E
25|$|On 1 November, 60th Division {{was ordered}} to prepare {{to move to the}} Macedonian front, and the {{battalion}} embarked at Marseille on 25 November and landed at Salonika on 1 December. It began the march north on 18 December and went into the line on Christmas Eve. The battalion was <b>peripherally</b> involved in the Battle of Doiran 24–5 April and 8–9 May 1917.|$|E
25|$|Oral 5-HTP {{results in}} an {{increase}} in urinary 5-HIAA, a serotonin metabolite, indicating that 5-HTP is <b>peripherally</b> metabolized to serotonin, which is then metabolized. This might cause a false positive test in tests looking for carcinoid syndrome. Due to the conversion of 5-HTP into serotonin by the liver, there may be a significant risk of heart valve disease from serotonin's effect on the heart.|$|E
25|$|Trafficking {{proteins}} {{are more}} complex. They include intrinsic membrane proteins, <b>peripherally</b> bound proteins, and proteins such as SNAREs. These proteins {{do not share}} a characteristic {{that would make them}} identifiable as synaptic vesicle proteins, and little is known about how these proteins are specifically deposited into synaptic vesicles. Many but not all of the known synaptic vesicle proteins interact with non-vesicular proteins and are linked to specific functions.|$|E
25|$|Unions have {{recently}} been engaged in a developing field of transnational labor regulation embodied in corporate codes of conduct. However, O'Brien cautions that unions have been only <b>peripherally</b> involved in this process, and remain ambivalent about its potential effects. They worry that these codes could have legitimizing effects on companies that do not actually live up to good practices, and that companies could use codes to excuse or distract attention from the repression of unions.|$|E
25|$|When utilising high {{resolution}} CT scans, {{there can be}} better assessment of the distribution and pattern of bronchiectasis within the lungs, and hence this is the tool of choice in the radiological diagnosis of ABPA. Central (confined to medial two-thirds of medial half of the lung) bronchiectasis that <b>peripherally</b> tapers bronchi is considered a requirement for ABPA pathophysiology, though in up to 43% of cases there is considerable extension to {{the periphery of the}} lung.|$|E
25|$|Some {{water-soluble}} {{proteins and}} peptides can also form transmembrane channels. They usually undergo oligomerization, significant conformational changes, and associate with membranes irreversibly. 3D structure {{of one such}} transmembrane channel, α-hemolysin, has been determined. In other cases, the experimental structure represents a water-soluble conformation that interacts with the lipid bilayer <b>peripherally,</b> {{although some of the}} channel-forming peptides are rather hydrophobic and therefore were studied by NMR spectroscopy in organic solvents or in the presence of micelles.|$|E
25|$|Iranian nanotechnologists {{researched}} {{the chance of}} nanotechnology uses in targeted drug delivery systems to therapy of cancer. This examine studied {{the creation of a}} nanodrug and its effects on the remedy of breast cancer. The goal of the scientist was to present curcumin nano-drug with a sluggish and effectual release model to heal breast cancer. Curcumin is a drug with anti-cancer and anti-inflammation properties. The drug is typically used orally or <b>peripherally.</b>|$|E
25|$|Greece was <b>peripherally</b> {{involved}} in the Napoleonic Wars, but one episode had important consequences. When the French under Napoleon Bonaparte seized Venice in 1797, they also acquired the Ionian Islands, thus ending the four hundredth year of Venetian rule over the Ionian Islands. The islands were elevated {{to the status of}} a French dependency called the Septinsular Republic, which possessed local autonomy. This was the first time Greeks had governed themselves since the fall of Trebizond in 1461.|$|E
25|$|During Habib Ullah’s reign, Faiz Mohammad was involved, if only <b>peripherally,</b> {{with the}} Young Afghan {{movement}} led by Mahmud Baig Tarzi. He {{is said to}} have been associated with the publication of Tarzi’s reformist journal, Siraj al-Akbar, and three other journals, Anis, Ḥayy alal-falah, and Aina-ye Irfan. After the assassination of his patron in 1337/1919, Faiz Mohammad worked for a time at the Ministry of Education on textbook revision. Sometime later, he was appointed to a teaching position at the Habibiya Laycee (Habibiya High School) in Kabul.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have also}} found that {{recognition}} memory involving epinephrine depends on a mechanism that depends on β adrenoceptors. Epinephrine does not readily cross the blood–brain barrier, so its effects on memory consolidation are at least partly initiated by β adrenoceptors in the periphery. Studies have found that sotalol, a β adrenoceptor antagonist that also does not readily enter the brain, blocks the enhancing effects of <b>peripherally</b> administered epinephrine on memory. These findings suggest that β adrenoceptors are necessary for epinephrine {{to have an effect}} on memory consolidation.|$|E
25|$|Other analgesics work <b>peripherally</b> (i.e., not on {{the brain}} or spinal cord). Research is {{starting}} to show that morphine and related drugs may indeed have peripheral effects as well, such as morphine gel working on burns. Recent investigations discovered opioid receptors on peripheral sensory neurons. A significant fraction (up to 60%) of opioid analgesia can be mediated by such peripheral opioid receptors, particularly in inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, traumatic or surgical pain. Inflammatory pain is also blunted by endogenous opioid peptides activating peripheral opioid receptors.|$|E
25|$|Terrestrial {{and a large}} {{proportion}} of aquatic insects perform gaseous exchange as previously mentioned under an open system. Other smaller numbers of aquatic insects have a closed tracheal system, for example, Odonata, Tricoptera, Ephemeroptera, which have tracheal gills and no functional spiracles. Endoparasitic larvae are without spiracles and also operate under a closed system. Here the tracheae separate <b>peripherally,</b> covering the general body surface which results in a cutaneous form of gaseous exchange. This peripheral tracheal division may also lie within the tracheal gills where gaseous exchange may also take place.|$|E
25|$|Ondansetron is {{a highly}} {{specific}} and selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, with low affinity for dopamine receptors. The 5-HT3 receptors are present both <b>peripherally</b> on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. Serotonin is released by the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine in response to chemotherapeutic agents and may stimulate vagal afferents (via 5-HT3 receptors) to initiate the vomiting reflex. It is thought that ondansetron's antiemetic action is mediated mostly via antagonism of vagal afferents with a minor contribution from antagonism of central receptors.|$|E
25|$|The {{function}} of the vestibular system during spaceflight {{is by far the}} most carefully studied of all. This is especially true of the gravity-sensing otolith organs and their relationship to eye movements. The vestibular semicircular canal function seems unchanged in weightlessness because the horizontal eye movements that compensated for head yaw rotation are not affected by spaceflight. The absence of gravity stimulation of the otoliths reduces the torsional vestibulo-ocular reflex during head roll rotation in microgravity. This deficit is absent when astronauts are exposed to centrifugal forces, suggesting that the adaptive CNS changes are taking place centrally rather than <b>peripherally.</b>|$|E
