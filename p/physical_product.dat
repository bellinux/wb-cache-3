25|$|As {{objections}} to the advent of home video from factions of the entertainment industry began to die down, in November 1984, HBO partnered with independent film distributor Thorn EMI to form Thorn EMI/HBO Video. Thorn EMI cut various distribution agreements with smaller film production companies {{that did not have}} their own home video units, such as Orion Pictures and New Line Cinema. In 1986, Cannon Films bought out Thorn EMI's interest in the unit, which was accordingly renamed HBO/Cannon Video. Cannon dropped out of the venture by 1987 after the studio took a financial hit following its attempt at a series of larger budget films that did not experience box office success; the unit was then renamed HBO Video. Over time, HBO Video (which eventually became HBO Home Entertainment by the early 2010s, with <b>physical</b> <b>product</b> manufactured by Warner Home Video) shifted away from releasing films from independent studios to releasing HBO's catalog of original programs and films on DVD and Blu-ray Disc.|$|E

40|$|Product/Service Systems have {{recently}} grown in manufacturers’ interest. This paper presents an international survey of manufacturers from Sweden, Japan, Italy and Germany. The {{results show that}} customer connection and demands along with increased competition were main driving forces for product/service systems. Also, most product/service systems include <b>physical</b> <b>products,</b> maintenance and repairs. Staff working with product development, marketing and after sales were the major actors in product/service system development. As in traditional product sales, most product/service systems still have the ownership of <b>physical</b> <b>products</b> transferred to the customer/user. <b>Physical</b> <b>products</b> used in product/service systems are seldom adapted for product/service systems.

25|$|The {{software}} distribution {{of a product}} can be done offline as well as online. In an offline situation the package is a physical package which contains all the elements. The software is stored on a data carrier such as a CD or a DVD, and the documents might also be stored in a digital form on this data carrier, or they might be in physical form such as a booklet. The package {{as a whole is}} a <b>physical</b> <b>product.</b> In an online situation the entire package needs to be in a digital form. The consequences on the distribution process are described in the following paragraphs. CCU is designed to fit both situations but as bandwidth is growing it is making more sense to distribute especially updates and new versions to existing customers online. In this article both ways are discussed. In the process-data model it is assumed that the software vendor conducts both distribution channels. As a practical example: HISComp, a provider of medical information systems distributes its software straightforward via CDs. However they use their website to distribute patches for the software products.|$|E
500|$|Molleindustria named Diamond Trust of London as one {{of their}} top games of 2012, {{describing}} it as Rohrer's [...] "most elegantly designed game to date". They highlighted how it critiques the blood diamond trade by using game mechanics that present [...] "the world from the cynical, detached perspective of the Homo economicus", rather than by lecturing the player. Paste echoed these thoughts, stating that the game offered [...] "no overt judgments" [...] on the diamond trade, but had mechanics that paint it as [...] "one that encourages and maybe even requires misdeeds". Reflecting on the game's unlikely journey in becoming a <b>physical</b> <b>product,</b> Paste declared Diamond Trust of London to be [...] "not just a success in design, but also one of creation".|$|E

2500|$|This vision {{produces}} a core proposition in textbook neoclassical economics, i.e., that the income earned by each [...] "factor of production" [...] (essentially, labor and [...] "capital") {{is equal to}} its marginal product. Thus, with perfect product and input markets, the wage (divided by {{the price of the}} product) is alleged to equal the marginal <b>physical</b> <b>product</b> of labor. More importantly for the discussion here, the rate of profit (sometimes confused with the rate of interest, i.e., the cost of borrowing funds) is supposed to equal the marginal <b>physical</b> <b>product</b> of capital. (For simplicity, abbreviate [...] "capital goods" [...] as [...] "capital.") A second core proposition is that a change in the price of a factor of production will lead to a change in the use of that factor [...] an increase in the rate of profit (associated with falling wages) will lead to more of that factor being used in production. The law of diminishing marginal returns implies that greater use of this input will imply a lower marginal product, all else equal: since a firm is getting less from adding a unit of capital goods than is received from the previous one, the rate of profit must increase to encourage the employment of that extra unit, assuming profit maximization.|$|E
60|$|It {{is strange}} that any one, {{after such a}} warning, should rely implicitly on the {{evidence}} a priori of such propositions as these, that matter can not think; that space, or extension, is infinite; that nothing can be made out of nothing (ex nihilo nihil fit). Whether these propositions are true {{or not this is}} not the place to determine, nor even whether the questions are soluble by the human faculties. But such doctrines are no more self-evident truths, than the ancient maxim that a thing can not act where it is not, which probably is not now believed by any educated person in Europe.(236) Matter can not think; why? because we can not conceive thought to be annexed to any arrangement of material particles. Space is infinite, because having never known any part of it which had not other parts beyond it, we can not conceive an absolute termination. Ex nihilo nihil fit, because having never known any <b>physical</b> <b>product</b> without a pre-existing physical material, we can not, or think we can not, imagine a creation out of nothing. But these things may in themselves be as conceivable as gravitation without an intervening medium, which Newton thought too great an absurdity for any person of a competent faculty of philosophical thinking to admit: and even supposing them not conceivable, this, for aught we know, may be merely one of the limitations of our very limited minds, and not in nature at all.|$|E

Open design involves the making of both free and open-source software (FOSS) as well as open-source hardware.

The goals and philosophy are identical to that of the open-source movement, but are implemented for the development of <b>physical</b> <b>products</b> rather than software. Open design is a form of co-creation, where the final product is designed by the users, rather than an external stakeholder such as a private company.|$|R

Empirical results indicate that service turnover of manufacturing firms is still small compared to the turnover with <b>physical</b> <b>products.</b> National differences play only a minor role in explaining the degree of servitisation. Firm size is of more relevance. Results reveal a U-shaped relationship between firm size and servitisation which points to advantages of both, small and large firms in servitisation.
