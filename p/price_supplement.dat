40|$|Over {{half of all}} {{infant formula}} sold in the United States is {{purchased}} through the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Typically, WIC State agencies obtain substantial discounts {{in the form of}} rebates from infant formula manufacturers for each can of formula purchased through the program. The cost to WIC for each can of formula provided through the program has two components: (1) net wholesale price, which is equal to the wholesale price of formula minus the amount of the rebate; and (2) retail markup, which is equal to the retail price minus the wholesale price. This analysis suggests that retail markup accounts for most of the cost to WIC of infant formula in most States. However, both cost components have increased over time.

The findings of this study, unfortunately, point out that in many cases the target groups have been largely missed by the programs due to low coverage and being only loosely targeted in practice. It should be emphasized, however, that effectiveness of the programs varies across programs and regions. This raises an interesting avenue for future studies on what accounts for these targeting outcomes. The general conclusion from this study points to the need for a large improvement in the program implementations, in particular in targeting the beneficiaries of a particular program and raising coverage within the target groups. 3 I...|$|R

40|$|Rapidly {{expanding}} {{ethanol production}} in the U. S. was given further impetus {{with the passage of}} the Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandating a minimum production of 7. 5 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2012. The availability of the by-product feeds of ethanol production (corn gluten feed and meal and DDG) has not only become a significant share of the protein feed sector, but also the increase has been and will be extensive. The challenge is how to incorporate these feeds into econometric models of U. S. agriculture and measure their impact on the utilization of other feeds, particularly coarse grain and soybean meal. Another task is to forecast prices on the by-product feeds. This paper suggests a couple of procedures embracing the entire sector of livestock concentrates, including both protein and energy feeds. The feeds were converted into protein equivalents and energy equivalents and introduced into regression equations predicting (1) the amounts of soybean meal and coarse grain fed and (2) the amount of protein feeds utilized in protein equivalents and the amount of all concentrate feeds utilized in energy equivalents. In case (2), the amounts of soybean meal and coarse grain fed were derived by deducting the protein and energy equivalents of the other feeds from the totals predicted. This case was the one selected to be incorporated into AGMOD, an econometric model of U. S. agriculture. To forecast prices on the by-product feeds of ethanol production, synthetic prices for protein and energy were derived from prices on soybean meal and corn. Applying these prices to the ethanol byproduct feeds, values for these feeds were generated. These values were the major explanatory variables associated with the by-product <b>prices</b> <b>supplemented</b> by variables representing the ratios of the utilization of the respective feeds in protein equivalents to the total utilization of protein feeds in protein equivalents. Prices on corn gluten feed and DDG have been declining relative to their values, with continued downward pressure in prospect for prices on DDG in the next 10 years.

40|$|Background The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare differences in cost estimates for paediatric HIV hospital service provision based on hospital prices with cost estimates obtained through a research-based service-specific costing exercise. Methods Activity data on the use of hospital services of children by stage of HIV infection were collected from case-notes for 118 HIV antibody positive children, managed at St Mary's Hospital NHS Trust, London, 1 January 1986 - 31 December 1994. Hospital unit prices were obtained from the Hospital Trust Finance Department; unit cost estimates were obtained from relevant hospital departments through a research-based service-specific costing exercise. Financial data related to the 1993 - 1994 financial year, and were indexed to 1995 - 1996 prices. The main outcome measures were cost estimates per patient-year by stage of HIV infection. Three cost scenarios were calculated: first by linking activity data with hospital prices (Trust Prices); second by linking activity data with routinely available hospital prices plus units costs from the costing exercise where no relevant hospital <b>prices</b> existed (<b>Supplemented</b> Trust Prices); third, by linking activity data exclusively with unit costs from the hospital-specific costing exercise (Unit Costs). Results There were substantial differences between unit cost estimates per patient-year based on Trust <b>Prices</b> and <b>Supplemented</b> Trust <b>Prices</b> compared with those based on Unit Costs. Differences increased with more intense use of services. The deficit based on Trust Prices compared with Unit Costs ranged from pound 432 per patient-year for HIV negative children, pound 574 for asymptomatic HIV-infected children, pound 1288 for indeterminate children, pound 1814 for children with symptomatic non-AIDS to pound 7418 per patient-year for children with AIDS. Conclusions In this hospital, reliance on generic hospital prices to derive cost estimates for paediatric HIV services produced considerable underestimates of the cost of service provision compared with data derived through the costing exercise. If this occurs across all or most areas of service provision, this can lead to substantial financial deficits, which in turn may mean that the needs of specific client populations may not be met...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} of beef producers to profitably produce 500 -kg steers at 2. 5 {{years of age}} in northern Australia's dry tropics to meet specifications of high-value markets, using a high-input management (HIM) system was examined. HIM included targeted high levels of fortified molasses supplementation, short seasonal mating {{and the use of}} growth promotants. Using herds of 300 - 400 females plus steer progeny at three sites, HIM was compared at a business level to prevailing best-practice, strategic low-input management (SLIM) {{in which there is a}} relatively low usage of energy concentrates to supplement pasture intake. The data presented for each breeding-age cohort within management system at each site includes: annual pregnancy rates (range: 14 - 99 %), time of conception, mortalities (range: 0 - 10 %), progeny losses between confirmed pregnancy and weaning (range: 0 - 29 %), and weaning rates (range: 14 - 92 %) over the 2 -year observation. Annual changes in weight and relative net worth were calculated for all breeding and non-breeding cohorts. Reasons for outcomes are discussed. Compared with SLIM herds, both weaning weights and annual growth were >= 30 kg higher, enabling 86 - 100 % of HIM steers to exceed 500 kg at 2. 5 years of age. Very few contemporary SLIM steers reached this target. HIM was most profitably applied to steers. Where HIM was able to achieve high pregnancy rates in yearlings, its application was recommended in females. Well managed, appropriate HIM systems increased profits by around $ 15 /adult equivalent at prevailing beef and <b>supplement</b> <b>prices.</b> However, a 20 % <b>supplement</b> <b>price</b> rise without a commensurate increase in values for young slaughter steers would generally eliminate this advantage. This study demonstrated the complexity of pro. table application of research outcomes to commercial business, even when component research suggests that specific strategies may increase growth and reproductive efficiency and/or be more pro. table. Because of the higher level of management required, higher costs and returns, and higher susceptibility to market changes and disease, HIM systems should only be applied after SLIM systems are well developed. To increase profitability, any strategy must ultimately either increase steer growth and sale values and/or enable a shift to high pregnancy rates in yearling heifers...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{examined the}} benefit of feeding fishmeal to high-producing Jersey cows receiving a maize-based supplement (6 kg/d), while grazing kikuyu pasture in late summer. Three groups of 14 cows received no additional supplement (control), a low fishmeal or a high fishmeal supplement (4 or 8 % fishmeal replacing some of the maize). All supplements were iso-energetic. Milk yield increased {{with the level of}} fishmeal fed but the response was significant (P< 0. 05) only for the higher level (19. 5 vs 18. 2 kg/d). Milk fat percentage was higher (P< 0. 05) for the low fishmeal treatment (4. 18 %) than for the control (3. 71 %), so that yields of 4 % fat-corrected milk were higher for both fishmeal treatments than for the control (19. 4 and 19. 2 vs 17. 3 kg/d). Milk urea N was higher for the high fishmeal treatment (10. 8 mg/dl) than for the control and low fishmeal treatments (9. 1 and 9. 4 mg/dl). In a simultaneous study, 8 rumen-cannulated cows, grazing with those in the main study, were fed the control and high fishmeal treatments in a crossover design. Ruminal ammonia-N concentration was higher in the cows on the high fishmeal treatment than in the controls (6. 52 vs 4. 74 mg/dl) as was acetate:propionate ratio.

Recent health reform in Mexico launched a new subsidized insurance program, necessitating informed choices on the different interventions that might {{be covered by the}} program, including neonatal {{intensive care}}. The {{purpose of this study was}} to estimate the clinical outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness of neonatal intensive care in Mexico. A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using a decision analytic model of health and economic outcomes following preterm birth. Model parameters governing health outcomes were estimated from Mexican vital registration and hospital discharge databases, supplemented with meta-analyses and systematic reviews from the published literature. Costs were estimated on the basis of data provided by the Ministry of Health in Mexico and World Health Organization <b>price</b> lists, <b>supplemented</b> with published studies from other countries as needed. The model estimated changes in clinical outcomes, life expectancy, disability-free life expectancy, lifetime costs, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for neonatal intensive care compared to no intensive care. Uncertainty around the results was characterized using one-way sensitivity analyses and a multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis. In the base-case analysis, neonatal intensive care for infants born at 24 - 26, 27 - 29, and 30 - 33 weeks gestational age prolonged life expectancy by 28, 43, and 34 years and averted 9, 15, and 12 DALYs, at incremental costs per infant of US$ 11, 400, US$ 9, 500, and US$ 3, 000, respectively, compared to an alternative of no intensive care. The ICERs of neonatal intensive care at 24 - 26, 27 - 29, and 30 - 33 weeks were US$ 1, 200, US$ 650, and US$ 240, per DALY averted, respectively. The findings were robust to variation in parameter values over wide ranges in sensitivity analyses. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for neonatal intensive care imply very high value for money on the basis of conventional benchmarks for cost-effectiveness analysis.

Taking market clearing equilibrium price under the assumption of a closed economy, the imposition of price control was found to favour consumers at the expense of producers. Based on the 1992 equilibrium price level, welfare gain accrued to the consumers as represented by the consumeris surplus, was estimated at consumers as represented by the consumeris surplus, was estimated at RM 205 thousand per year, while a reduction in the producer's surplus, constituting a welfare loss, was estimated at RM 188 thousand. Excess demand resulting from the existing <b>pricing</b> policy was <b>supplemented</b> by rice imports, amounting to 2, 535 metric tons during the year.

40|$|Congestion on {{highways}} often occurs by sudden {{transitions from}} {{free flow traffic}} to synchronized traffic. Associated with such phase transitions are large decreases in speed. Such phase transitions seem to be often caused by temporal distortions in traffic flows, such as a short peak {{in the flow of}} traffic entering a highway from a ramp. If the traffic flow on the ramp has decreased after the peak, congestion on the highway may persist for a longer period. The paper develops a model of congestion for such situations that is based on assumptions about driver behavior and has these characteristics. Critical properties of driver behavior are that, for obvious reasons, sudden large changes in speed are avoided and that reactions to other drivers occur with some delay. In a model where speed can be changed immediately from to any desired value (and vice versa) and drivers react immediately to each other some of the typical characteristics of congestion on highways do not occur. The model suggests that control of the traffic flow, and especially of variations in traffic density, is of major importance in dealing with congestion. Measures for reducing congestion that intend to decrease the average flow of traffic (such as road <b>pricing)</b> should be <b>supplemented</b> by measures reducing the variation in that flow. ...|$|R
40|$|Lactating {{dairy cow}} diets {{with more than}} 24 % starch (DM basis) are common, but recent high corn prices have fueled a desire to feed lower-starch diets. The {{potential}} for using digestible neutral detergent fiber or pectin from byproduct feeds or sugars to partially replace starch from corn grain in diets fed to lactating dairy cows was reviewed. Potential modifying effects of corn silage, starch digestibility and ionophore on lactation performance by dairy cows fed low starch diets was also evaluated. Lactation performance was reduced for 18 % and 20 % starch diets (DM basis) formulated using beet pulp and citrus pulp, respectively, to partially replace corn grain. Lactation performance was not reduced for 16 %- 17 % starch diets (DM basis) formulated using soyhulls to partially replace corn grain. Diets containing 21 % starch (DM basis) appear to be acceptable when high-fiber, moderate protein byproduct feeds are used to partially replace corn grain and protein supplement. Feeding corn silage at {{a higher percentage of}} the forage, high starch corn silage, sugars and ionophore can reduce the percentage of corn needed in highstarch diets or increase the “corn equivalency ” of low-starch diets. The cost of using digestible NDF or pectin from byproduct feeds or sugars to partially replace starch from corn grain needs to be evaluated relative to corn and protein <b>supplement</b> <b>prices.</b> The starch in low-starch diets should be highly digestible...|$|R
40|$|The social theoretic turn inaugurated {{under the}} rise of constructivism in International Relations has, among other themes, created a much-enlarged space for {{treating}} norms as efficacious explanatory variables in analyses of world politics. In this article, I reconstruct mainstream constructivists’ inclinations toward what I argue are sociological accounts of norms, in which {{the question of the}} latter’s justification is comprehensively sidelined. I initially show how constructivists’ strategy of delineating their approaches from Critical Theory and post-structural analyses sustains social theoretic commitments, which compound this problem. In {{the second part of the}} article, I focus on Richard Price’s programmatic attempt to reconcile the constructivist achievements in empirical research on the efficacy of norms with normative theorizing. The idea of building a bridge from ‘isses’ to ‘oughts’ labors, as I demonstrate, from the outset under construction problems, which cannot be resolved on the premises from which Price seeks to operate. Concluding this part, I consider the possibility of <b>supplementing</b> <b>Price’s</b> account with consequentialist normative theory, and demonstrate that this would incur further problems for a normative theoretic framework for the study of world politics. In the final part, I outline key themes of Critical Theory with the aim of addressing some persistent misunderstandings about its scope, social theoretic outlook, and normative commitments. Linking back to the critical appraisal of mainstream constructivism’s norm-sociological commitments, I suggest that despite some important limitations of its own, Critical Theory is in a better position to address ‘isses’ and ‘oughts’ than constructivists’ readings of it would suggest...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 08 Chapter 1 and 2 : We {{survey and}} apply several {{techniques}} from the statistical {{and computer science}} literature {{to the problem of}} demand estimation. We derive novel asymptotic properties for several of these models. To improve out-of-sample prediction accuracy and obtain parametric rates of convergence, we propose a method of combining the underlying models via linear regression. We illustrate our method using a standard scanner panel data set to estimate promotional lift and find that our estimates are considerably more accurate in out-of-sample predictions of demand than some commonly-used alternatives. While demand estimation is our motivating application, these methods are widely applicable to other microeconometric problems. Chapter 3 : 	We collect high dimensional data and extract features from house descriptions and images to use as controls within a hedonic model to estimate the impact of fracking on house <b>prices</b> in Pennsylvania. <b>Supplementing</b> a structured dataset with high dimensional unstructured data in the form of descriptive words and images of homes can help to close the gap caused by omitted variable bias. We construct curb appeal scores based on aesthetic features of home images. We then compare four models: OLS, LASSO - OLS, random forest and gradient boosting. The ensemble tree models (random forest and gradient boosting) yield 10 % improvements in prediction accuracy compared to LASSO and OLS. Our results imply that royalty payments exactly compensate for the negative environmental effects on homes within 1 km of fracking wells but increase the price of houses farther away by up to 5 %...|$|R
