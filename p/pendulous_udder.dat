40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} was aimed to {{investigate}} the relationship of udder shape, teat-end shape, teat length, and teat diameter with intra-mammary infection in Jersey crossbred cows under hot-humid climate. Materials and Methods: A total of 24 lactating Jersey crossbred cows were evaluated for udder shape (pendulous/regular) and teat-end shape (flat/inverted/pointed) by visual examination, while teat length and teat diameter were measured using vernier caliper. Monthly milk sampling was done for 4 months of duration. Few quarters were found as blind or nonfunctional and so, a total of 366 quarter wise milk samples were collected at the monthly interval and subjected to somatic cell count (SCC) microscopically. The data on SCC were transformed into log scale and analyzed. Results: There was a significant (p< 0. 01) effect of udder shape and teat-end shape on SCC level. The mean SCC level for <b>pendulous</b> <b>udder</b> was significantly (p< 0. 05) higher {{as compared to the}} regular shaped udder. Similarly, significantly (p< 0. 05) a higher level of mean SCC was found in flat teat-end shape. A significant (p< 0. 01) correlation was found between SCC and teat length as well as teat diameter. Conclusion: In conclusion, <b>pendulous</b> <b>udder,</b> flat and inverted teat-end, very long and thick teat were more susceptible to intra-mammary infection in Jersey crossbred cows and these traits must be considered accordingly while selecting dairy animals for future milk production...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} on 453 lactating cattle of various breed present at 21 farms. The milk samples from these animals were collected to diagnose mastitis using California Mastitis Test (CMT). The epidemiological data related to animals and management was collected and analyzed to draw conclusions. The results of t-test revealed significant association between body weight, udder depth, and lower teat end to floor distance (P< 0. 01) with mastitis. The bivariate frequency analysis revealed significant association for lactation stage (P< 0. 0001), teat end to floor distance, parity, udder shape, teat shape, live body weight, teat and/or udder pathology, use of oxytocin, feeding system and milk leakage with mastitis. The results of logistic regression analysis revealed significant negative association between teat length, frequency of culling and number of attendants, while positive association between mastitis teat involved, teat diameter (apex, mid and base), milk leakage, udder shape, <b>pendulous</b> <b>udder,</b> feeding system, udder depth, teat shape, calf suckling, milk yield, teat and/or udder pathology and live body weight. From the results of present {{it can be concluded}} that some risk factors were strongly associated with mastitis in cattle...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the rela-tionship between clinical findings and bacterial isolation in milk samples of meat-producing ewes. The study was conducted in 17 commercial flocks and 550 udder halves from suckling Santa Ines ewes. Initially, the clinical examination of the mammary glands and teats was performed by visual inspection and palpation of the teats and udder halves; then a scoring system was devised for all the findings. After that, the strip cup test and the California mastitis test (CMT) were performed. Then, milk samples for somatic cell counts (SCCs) and bacteriological analyses were collected. Staphylococci bacteria were the main etiological agent isolated in the present study. Upon investigation of the correlations between bacterial isolation and the clinical findings, only the presence of teat injury, <b>pendulous</b> <b>udder,</b> and alterations in the palpation of the teat were associated with bacterial isolation. A significant correlation between bacteriologically positive milk samples and CMT and SCC was also found. Thus, some clinical findings appeared as a risk factor for bacteriologically positive milk samples and can be used as a tool in mastitis control programs. However, a complete and extensive diagnosis, an appropriate therapy, and an efficient mastitis control program will require the combination of clinical examination, micro-biological tests, and SCC...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} 10 {{different}} herds were randomly sampled and milk samples obtained from 263 lactating does with normal sized udder and enlarged (unilateral/bilateral) <b>pendulous</b> <b>udders.</b> The obtained milk samples were analyzed for mastitis using a rapid field catalase test (RFCT). From 194 samples obtained from NSU (Normal Size Udder), 164 samples were negative {{to the test}} while 30 samples were positive. These represent 84. 5 % negatives and 15. 5 % positives {{of the total sample}} analyzed. Similarly, 69 samples were obtained from both U/BEU (Unilateral/Bilateral Enlarged Udder), 42 samples were negative to RFCT while 27 samples positive, representing 60. 7 % negatives and 39. 3 % positives of the total analyzed samples. The information obtained from this research work is to sensitize farmers on the need for routine examination/screening of their herd for mastitis; since mastitis occurring as the most common and costly disease which could take a heavier toll in animal industry than any single disease through considerable economic loss. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{cohort study}} of 67 suckler ewes from 1 farm {{was carried out}} from January to May 2010 to {{investigate}} associations between udder conformation, udder half milk somatic cell count (SCC), and lamb weight. Ewes and lambs were observed at lambing. Ewe health and teat condition and lamb health and weight were recorded on 4 to 5 further occasions at 14 -d intervals. At each observation, a milk sample was collected from each udder half for somatic cell counting. Two weeks after lambing, ewe udder conformation and teat placement were scored. Low lamb weight was associated with ewe SCC > 400, 000 cells/mL (− 0. 73 kg), a new teat lesion 14 d previously (− 0. 91 kg), suboptimal teat position (− 1. 38 kg), rearing in a multiple litter (− 1. 45 kg), presence of diarrhea at the examination (− 1. 19 kg), and rearing by a 9 -yr-old ewe compared with a 6 -yr-old ewe (− 2. 36 kg). High lamb weight was associated with increasing lamb age (0. 21 kg/d), increasing birth weight (1. 65 kg/kg at birth), and increasing number of days the ewe was given supplementary feed before lambing (0. 06 kg/d). High udder half SCC was associated with <b>pendulous</b> <b>udders</b> (9. 6 % increase in SCC/cm of drop) and greater total cross-sectional area of the teats (7. 2 % increase of SCC/cm 2). Low SCC were associated with a heavier mean litter weight (6. 7 % decrease in SCC/kg). Linear, quadratic, and cubic terms for days in lactation were also significant. We conclude that poor udder and teat conformation are associated {{with high levels of}} intramammary infection, as indicated by increased SCC and that both physical attributes of the udder and SCC are linked to lamb growth, suggesting that selection of suckler ewes with better udder and teat conformation would reduce intramammary infection and increase lamb growth rate...|$|R
40|$|Udder {{quality is}} an {{important}} factor related to cow longevity and calf performance. Cows with tighter udder suspension and smaller teats tend to have greater longevity. When cows stay in the herd longer, fewer replacement heifers need to be developed to maintain herd size. <b>Pendulous,</b> poorly suspended <b>udders</b> and large teats are difficult for newborn calves to nurse, and additional labor might be required to assist those calves. Cows with poor udder quality can have increased calf mortality because the calf struggles to nurse and consumes colostrum later. Because many beef producers sell calves by the pound at weaning, poor udder quality can {{have a negative impact on}} profit. The dairy industry has selected for udder quality for many years. Udder traits are generally moderately heritable in dairy cattle, but limited research has been done in beef cattle. Beef producers would benefit from genetic selection tools for improving udder quality, especially for herds where udder quality affects calf performance. Our objective was to estimate the heritabilities and genetic correlations for udder quality traits in Hereford cattle. American Hereford Association members have been reporting udder scores for a number of years. The American Hereford Association initially began collecting an overall udder score, which combined all udder characteristics into a single score. In 2008, the Beef Improvement Federation developed udder scoring guidelines, including scores for both udder suspension and teat size. By August 2008, the American Hereford Association began using these new guidelines and collected udder suspension and teat size scores instead of the overall scores. All scores were recorded on a 1 to 9 scale, with scores of 9 considered ideal. Cows are scored at calving and could have multiple records throughout their lifetimes...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The present {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} study the association between udder morphology and in vitro activity of milk leukocytes in high yielding crossbred cows. Materials and Methods: A total of 48 healthy high yielding crossbred cows were selected for the study. The udder configuration and teat/udder morphology were recorded before milking. Milk samples (100 ml/cow) were collected aseptically. Milk somatic cell counts (SCC) and milk differential leukocyte counts were performed microscopically. Milk leukocytes (viz., neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages) were isolated from milk samples by density gradient centrifugation. Phagocytic index (PI) of milk neutrophils and macrophages were evaluated by colorimetric nitro blue tetrazolium assay. Lymphocytes proliferation response was estimated by MTT assay and expressed as stimulation index. Results: There was a significant (p< 0. 01) positive correlation between milk SCC with mid teat diameter, teat base diameter and significant (p< 0. 05) negative correlation between milk SCC and {{the height of the}} teat from the ground. Milk SCC was found to be significantly (p< 0. 01) lower in bowl-shaped udder and higher (p< 0. 01) in pendulous type. Milk macrophage percentage was positively (p< 0. 01) correlated with udder circumference. PI of milk neutrophil was negatively (p< 0. 01) correlation between teat base diameter, and PI of milk macrophages was found to be positively (p< 0. 01) correlated with teat apex diameter. Both PI of milk neutrophils and macrophages was found to be significantly (p< 0. 01) lower in the animals having flat and round teat and <b>pendulous</b> type of <b>udder.</b> In vitro PI of milk neutrophils was found to be significantly (p< 0. 01) lower in flat teat. In vitro PI of milk macrophages was found to be significantly (p< 0. 01) lower in the round and flat teats compared to pointed and cylindrical teats. Conclusion: Udder risk factors such as teat shape and size, teat to floor distance, udder shape, and size may decrease the in vitro activity of milk leukocytes hence facilitates the incidence intramammary infections...|$|R
