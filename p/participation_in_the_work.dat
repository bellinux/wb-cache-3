5|$|Some {{parts of}} Western Europe, {{especially}} Scandinavian {{countries have been}} creating family friendly policies that have aided them in equalizing the gender difference in <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> force. Nordic countries have the highest female participation rates {{in the work force}} in the world and salary differences are among the lowest. Government aid in providing care to the elderly and the young have enabled women in Scandinavia {{to be a part of}} the working population in nearly a high rate as men. Examples of government aid include paid parental leave and benefits and post maternity re-entry programs. Such programs have led to a greater participation of women in the workforce, as well as a higher birth rate, and a robust economy.|$|E

25|$|General Marshall managed some {{cooperation}} {{early in}} his mission, when both groups agreed {{to meet with him}} and form a top-level negotiating Committee of Three. Chiang Kai-shek appointed General Chang Chun as his representative, and Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, appointed Zhou Enlai. The committee held its first formal session at Chungking on January 7, 1946, and three days later, agreed on a cease-fire to take effect at midnight on January 13. The terms of the agreement were simple: Both sides were to cease hostilities and halt all troop movements except those of the Nationalist forces into and within Manchuria, where government sovereignty was being reasserted. An Executive Headquarters would be established at Peking following the Committee of Three pattern to supervise the cease-fire agreement, and operational teams– including a Nationalist, a Communist, and an American officer– would go into the field to ensure compliance with cease-fire provisions. It was made clear, however, that American <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of the Executive Headquarters would be restricted to aiding the Chinese members. In effect, each American team member acted as did General Marshall, but in a greatly restricted capacity.|$|E
500|$|Despite women's {{increasing}} <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> force, {{a gender}} {{division of labor}} persist. There {{are a number of}} constraints in the labor market that contribute to the double burden. [...] "Women are disproportionately represented in informal work and concentrated among lower-quality jobs within self-employment." [...] The informal market is generally precarious and characterized by low wages, few benefits, and a lack of social protections that are offered in the formal market. Even within the formal market, there is occupational segregation and a gender wage gap. Occupational segregation can be either horizontal or vertical: horizontal segregation limits women to certain sectors and occupations, while vertical segregation restricts them to particular positions within occupational hierarchies. Men and women are even found at different levels of the occupational hierarchy. The [...] "glass ceiling" [...] is the relative absence of women in senior or managerial positions due to institutional barriers and norms. Even in female-dominated occupations, men often occupy the more skilled and better paid positions.|$|E
40|$|Due to {{indigenous}} peoples 2 ̆ 7 focus on maintaining localized cultural difference, {{it is surprising}} that the indigenous rights movement has been so robust and pervasive on the global scale. World polity and transnational advocacy network (TAN) theories have attempted to explain the rise of the global indigenous movement, but unique features of indigenous peoples and their rights make the applications of these theories potentially problematic. This study looks at <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> global movement empirically, attempting to answer the questions of why and when indigenous peoples participate. With a new data set, I use event history analysis to model <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Working</b> Group on Indigenous Populations. I find that despite inherent contradictions between world culture and tenets of indigenous rights, world polity theory provides a compelling explanation of variation <b>in</b> <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Working</b> Group. At <b>the</b> same time, my research calls into question the explanatory power of grievances as a causal mechanism for participation, problematizing the application of TAN theories to the indigenous movement. Additionally, I find evidence for regional and materialistic explanation of <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Working</b> Group. It is likely that these factors can complement world polity theory in providing an understanding of indigenous involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> global movement...|$|R

2500|$|The {{first phase}} {{encompasses}} {{the time between}} the late 19th century to the 1930s. This era {{gave birth to the}} 'Independent female worker.' From 1890 to 1930, women in the workforce were typically young and unmarried. They had little or no learning on the job and typically held clerical and teaching positions. Many women also worked in textile manufacturing or as domestics. Women promptly exited the work force when they were married, unless the family needed two incomes. Towards the end of the 1920s, as we enter into the second phase, married women begin to exit the work force less and less. Labor force productivity for married women 35–44 years of age increase by 15.5 percentage points from 10% to 25%. There was a greater demand for clerical positions and as the number of women graduating high school increased they began to hold more [...] "respectable", steady jobs. This phase has been appropriately labeled as the Transition Era referring to the time period between 1930 and 1950. During this time the discriminatory institution of marriage bars, which forced women out of the work force after marriage, were eliminated, allowing more <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> force of single and married women. Additionally, women's labor force participation increased because there was an increase in demand for office workers and women participated in the high school movement. However, still women's work was contingent upon their husband's income. Women did not normally work to fulfill a personal need to define ones career and social worth; they worked out of necessity.|$|E
6000|$|There is {{something}} {{at any rate}} {{in the name of}} the publication which tells of work that did come. Thackeray's mind was at all times peculiarly exercised with a sense of snobbishness. His appreciation of the vice grew abnormally, so that at last he had a morbid horror of a snob--a morbid fear lest this or the other man should turn snob on his hands. It is probable that the idea was taken from the early Snob at Cambridge, either from his own <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> or from his remembrance of it. The Snob lived, I think, but nine weeks, and was followed at an interval, in 1830, by The Gownsman, which lived to the seventeenth number, and at the opening of which Thackeray no doubt had a hand. It professed to be a continuation of The Snob. It contains a dedication to all proctors, which I should not be sorry to attribute to him. [...] "To all Proctors, past, present, and future-- ...|$|E
60|$|I do {{not know}} of {{anything}} more pleasant to the eye than a pretty country church, decorated for Christmas-day. The effect in a city is altogether different. I will not say that churches {{there should not be}} decorated, but comparatively {{it is a matter of}} indifference. No one knows who does it. The peculiar munificence of the squire who has sacrificed his holly bushes is not appreciated. The work of the fingers that have been employed is not recognised. The efforts made for hanging the pendent wreaths to each capital have been of no special interest to any large number of the worshippers. It has been done by contract, probably, and even if well done has none of the grace of association. But here at Noningsby church, the winter flowers had been cut by Madeline and the gardener, and the red berries had been grouped by her own hands. She and the vicar's wife had stood together with perilous audacity on the top of the clerk's desk while they fixed the branches beneath the cushion of the old-fashioned turret, from which the sermons were preached. And all this had of course been talked about at the house; and some of the party had gone over to see, including Sophia Furnival, who had declared that nothing could be so delightful, though she had omitted to endanger her fingers by any <b>participation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>work.</b> And the children had regarded the operation as a triumph of all that was wonderful in decoration; and thus many of them had been made happy.|$|E
