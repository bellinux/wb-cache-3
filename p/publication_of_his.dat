5|$|Following the <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bestselling books, Speer donated a {{considerable}} amount of money to Jewish charities. According to Siedler, these donations were as high as 80% of his royalties. Speer kept the donations anonymous, both for fear of rejection, and for fear of being called a hypocrite.|$|E

5|$|Feynman was a keen popularizer {{of physics}} through both books and lectures, {{including}} a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom, and the three-volume <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> undergraduate lectures, The Feynman Lectures on Physics. Feynman also became known through his semi-autobiographical books Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and What Do You Care What Other People Think? and books written about him, such as Tuva or Bust! and Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman by James Gleick.|$|E
5|$|He {{eventually}} {{did receive}} a degree. Just before the <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Dictionary in 1755, Oxford University awarded Johnson {{the degree of}} Master of Arts. He was awarded an honorary doctorate in 1765 by Trinity College Dublin and in 1775 by Oxford University. In 1776, he returned to Pembroke with Boswell and toured the college with his former tutor Adams, who was now a Master. During that visit he recalled his time at the college, his early career, and expressed his later fondness for Jorden.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 Chaplin {{established}} his official filmography with the <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> book, My Autobiography. The filmography consisted of 80 motion pictures released since 1914. Further detail {{was added to}} it in David Robinson's 1985 biography, Chaplin: His Life and Art, which included Chaplin's last film, A Countess from Hong Kong (1967), as the 81st entry. In 2010 the 82nd film was added {{with the discovery of}} A Thief Catcher, an early Keystone film hitherto thought lost.|$|E

5|$|Mickiewicz and {{his family}} lived in {{relative}} poverty, their major source of income being occasional <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work – not a very profitable endeavor. They received support from friends and patrons, {{but not enough to}} substantially change their situation. Despite spending most of his remaining years in France, Mickiewicz would never receive French citizenship, nor any support from the French government. By the late 1830s he was less active as a writer, and also less visible on the Polish émigré political scene.|$|E
5|$|Mickiewicz {{was welcomed}} into the leading {{literary}} circles of Saint Petersburg and Moscow, {{where he became}} a great favorite for his agreeable manners and extraordinary talent for poetic improvisation. The year 1828 saw the <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> poem Konrad Wallenrod. Novosiltsev, who recognized its patriotic and subversive message, which had been missed by the Moscow censors, unsuccessfully attempted to sabotage its publication and to damage Mickiewicz's reputation.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{macroeconomics}} {{can be said}} to {{have begun}} with Keynes and the <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> book The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money in 1936. Keynes expanded on the concept of liquidity preferences and built a general theory of how the economy worked. Keynes's theory was brought together both monetary and real economic factors for the first time, explained unemployment, and suggested policy achieving economic stability.|$|E

5|$|Nuyts died on 11 December 1655 and {{was buried}} in a churchyard in Hulst. The {{tombstone}} remained until 1983, when it was destroyed during renovations of the church. After his funeral {{it was discovered that}} he had collected more taxes from his estates than he had handed over to the authorities; his son Pieter eventually repaid his father's debts. It was the younger Pieter who also arranged the posthumous <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father's treatise Lof des Elephants, in 1670 — a single known copy of which still exists, in the Koninklijke Bibliotheek in The Hague.|$|E
5|$|While doing {{research}} for his decorations, he read in an American magazine the article Comics in your Life. Fascinated, Vandersteen searched {{for more information}} on the subject. He rediscovered Hergé with The Adventures of Tintin in Le Petit Vingtième, but also the realistic work of Hal Foster in Prince Valiant. But it took a few more years before this fascination translated into steady <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own comics. Meanwhile, his first published drawings appeared in Entre Nous, the internal magazine of L'Innovation.|$|E
5|$|Abu Nuwar {{spent much}} of his time in exile between Syria and Egypt {{organizing}} opposition to Hussein and the monarchy, all the while maintaining his innocence in the Zarqa incident. He returned to Jordan in 1964 after being pardoned by Hussein as part of the latter's broader reconciliation efforts with his exiled opposition. In 1971, Abu Nuwar was made ambassador to France and he was later appointed to the Senate of Jordan's parliament in 1989. He died from blood cancer at a London hospital at age 66, one year after the <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> memoirs, A Time of Arab Decline: Memoirs of Arab Politics (1948–1964).|$|E

5|$|After the <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{book on the}} fur trade, Innis {{turned to}} a study of an earlier staple—the cod fished for centuries off the eastern coasts of North America, {{especially}} the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. The result was The Cod Fisheries: The History of an International Economy published in 1940, 10years after the fur trade study. Innis tells the detailed history of competing empires in the exploitation of a teeming natural resource—a history that ranges over 500years. While {{his study of the}} fur trade focused on the continental interior with its interlocking rivers and lakes, The Cod Fisheries looks outward at global trade and empire, showing the far-reaching effects of one staple product both on imperial centres and on marginal colonies such as Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and New England.|$|E
5|$|Darwin was a {{prolific}} writer. Even without <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> works on evolution, {{he would have}} had a considerable reputation as the author of The Voyage of the Beagle, as a geologist who had published extensively on South America and had solved the puzzle of the formation of coral atolls, and as a biologist who had published the definitive work on barnacles. While On the Origin of Species dominates perceptions of his work, The Descent of Man and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals had considerable impact, and his books on plants including The Power of Movement in Plants were innovative studies of great importance, as was his final work on The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms.|$|E
5|$|David Suzuki: The Autobiography is the 2006 {{autobiography}} of Canadian science writer and broadcaster David Suzuki. The book focuses mostly {{on his life}} since the 1987 <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> first autobiography, Metamorphosis: Stages in a Life. It begins with a chronological account of his childhood, academic years, and broadcasting career. In later chapters, Suzuki adopts a memoir style, writing about themes such as his relationship with Australia, his experiences in Brazil and Papua New Guinea, {{the founding of the}} David Suzuki Foundation, and his thoughts on climate change, celebrity status, technology, and death. Throughout, Suzuki highlights the continuing impact of events from his childhood.|$|E

5000|$|The {{house was}} {{originally}} built by Lorenzo Hamblin in the 1860s. Edward T. Archibald purchased {{the property and}} lived there from 1867 until 1885.

5|$|Fodor {{revived the}} idea of modularity, without the notion of precise {{physical}} localizability, in the 1980s, {{and became one of}} the most vocal proponents of it with the 1983 <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> monograph Modularity of Mind. Two properties of modularity in particular, informational encapsulation and domain specificity, make it possible to tie together questions of functional architecture with those of mental content. The ability to elaborate information independently from the background beliefs of individuals that these two properties allow Fodor to give an atomistic and causal account of the notion of mental content. The main idea, in other words, is that the properties of the contents of mental states can depend, rather than exclusively on the internal relations of the system of which they are a part, also on their causal relations with the external world.|$|E
5|$|In June 1910 Pound {{returned}} to the United States for eight months; his arrival coincided with the <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> first book of literary criticism, The Spirit of Romance, based on his lecture notes at the polytechnic. His essays on America were written during this period, compiled as Patria Mia and not published until 1950. He loved New York but felt the city was threatened by commercialism and vulgarity, and he no longer felt at home there. He found the New York Public Library, then being built, especially offensive and, according to Paul L. Montgomery, visited the architects' offices almost every day to shout at them.|$|E
5|$|Meksi did {{not live}} to see the 1827 <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{translation}} of the New Testament; he had died a bachelor six years earlier, at the age of about 51. The first publication of a Bible translation from Greek to a modern Balkanic language, it ran to 2,000copies, a huge number for the time. It preceded the modern Bulgarian version by two years and the Romanian translation by twenty. A second edition was published in 1858 in Athens, but as it had not been revised by any native speakers of Albanian it was full of errors.|$|E
50|$|After {{retiring}} in 1947, de Sélincourt settled at Niton on the Isle of Wight, and devoted himself to writing. He died there in December 1962, {{shortly after the}} <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> most successful books, The World of Herodotus.|$|R
50|$|Falconer {{spent three}} {{successful}} years in America, where he acted on Broadway and continued with his writing, creating three new dramas. One <b>of</b> <b>his</b> greatest fans was Mark Twain, author of Tom Sawyer, {{as can be}} witnessed in letters written by Twain. Such was his US success, that <b>publications</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> plays went through several editions. He also married an American woman, who was his third wife.|$|R
50|$|He was an apt mathematician, {{and one of}} {{the first}} people to provide {{evidence}} that craters on the Moon are the result <b>of</b> meteorite impact. <b>Publications</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mathematically justified theories in 1924 and 1930 contributed to the theory, which was later confirmed. Before this time, it had been popularly believed that craters on the Moon were caused by volcanic activity.|$|R
