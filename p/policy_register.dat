40|$|The {{national}} {{employment services}} {{have become a}} central point {{in the struggle against}} unemployment in the most countries. In Serbia, National Employment Service is under direct administration of the government, especially in the scope of labour market policy. The government is unable to carry out its policy without reliably information which is generated by the solid labour market policy database. The specific objective of this paper is the analysis of labour market policy database in Serbia and comparison with Eurostat database and methodology. Labour market policy databases in different countries have the structure based on unique methodology. Despite that, most common structure involves labour market <b>policy</b> <b>register,</b> as first section, register of participants, as second section and register of expenditures, as third. For {{the purpose of this paper}} we conducted the brief analysis of overall information system in National Employment Service in Serbia and detailed analysis of database sections including input variables and the ability of generating different reports. The prior research in this area was conducted in the first half of 2011, as a part of the EUNES IPA programme “Technical assistance for capacity building of the National Employment Services – Republic of Serbia for data management, forecasts, monitoring and evaluation”. Bearing in mind the conclusions in the previous research and findings of our analysis we found that there is no significant differences between scope of database, classification of interventions, expenditures and participants in the structure of database in Serbia in comparison with Eurostat methodology. We also find that the main problem in the matching in database is the differences between profession title list and job title list...|$|E

Yet most Canadian welfare, disability and social service programs deny or cancel benefits if applicants or recipients place a modest level of savings in an RRSP or TFSA.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to generate a substantive theory for the formulation of advanced placement <b>policies</b> for degree-seeking <b>registered</b> nurses. Interviews of 41 administrators, admissions personnel, nurse faculty, and registered nurse students and documents were used to analyze the processes these respondents went through in formulating advanced placement <b>policies</b> for <b>registered</b> nurses in three baccalaureate nursing degree programs. A qualitative grounded theory approach was used to collect, analyze, and synthesize data. Each person was interviewed, using an open-ended, in-depth format. Interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed in a verbatim manner. Data were analyzed and categories and elements emerged for advanced placement policy-formulating processes. Conceptual elements related to advanced placement policy formulation were identified. These included the participants such as policy formulators, implementers and recipients; interrelationships between participants through communication linkages and dissemination methods; and transfer of credit, credit by examination and life experience credit that were given as advanced placement mechanisms. Within the policy-formulating process, operational stages were also identified and analyzed. The operational stages were: academic mission and policy goals, policy projections and trends, program integrity and balance, policy implementation mechanisms and policy maintenance. Conceptual categories describing the events occurring within policy-formulating operational stages were organized into a set of six dichotomies. The dichotomies were: (a) consensus vs. diversity, (b) flexibility vs. rigidity, (c) specialization vs. generalization, (d) individualism vs. collectivism, (e) recipient focused vs. recipient excluded, and (f) recipient responsiveness vs. recipient unresponsiveness.

40|$|Abstract- Nowadays {{most of the}} {{commercial}} work make use of relational database management systems (RDBMS) to store {{a substantial amount of}} their data. Accessing information over the Internet has become an essential requirement. Authorization mechanisms in SQL permit access control at the level of complete tables or columns, or on views, providing coarse granularity. There is no direct way to control which tuples can be accessed by which users. Fine Grained Access Control (FGAC) is one of the ways to ensure data security. As per the requirements the granularity of fine grained access control can be on directories or folder level, database level, table level, even on individual record (tuple) and data field level. Access control is the process of mediating every request to resources and data maintained by a system and determining whether the request should be granted or denied. The access control decision is enforced by a mechanism implementing regulations established by a security policy. Corresponding to different criteria for defining what should, and what should not be allowed, different access control policies can be defined. In this paper, a novel access control model is proposed, which provides fine grained access control to shared data to authorized users. In proposed implementation, we have created a set of metatables, to store the data that make up the security <b>policies,</b> <b>registered</b> users and their authorization information. This allows policies to be created (or changed) dynamically. The access permissions are stored in the form of quadruple . Any change in policies doesn’t affect the application program. Moreover multiple policies defined to regulate user access together are also supported, which facilitates smooth access to user having multiple credentials without having him to mention each of his credentials at the time he makes request...|$|R

Simultaneously, high clock frequencies prohibit using large register files and bypass networks without a significant performance penalty.

We present novel mechanisms for managing and indexing register caches that address these problems using knowledge of the number of consumers of each register value. The insertion policy reduces pollution by not caching a register value when all of its predicted consumers are satisfied by the bypass network. The replacement <b>policy</b> selects <b>register</b> cache entries with the fewest remaining uses (often zero), lowering the miss rate. We also introduce a new, general method of mapping physical registers to register cache sets that improves the performance of set-associative cache organizations by reducing conflicts.

Risk register compilation is one component in the {{risk management}} process and allows for risks to be identified that {{pose a threat to}} an organisation meeting its objectives. The change project involved the introduction and population of risk registers in four clinical units in a teaching hospital. This led to further compliance with national healthcare <b>policy</b> on risk <b>register</b> implementation throughout the organisation and created a more visible risk profile. Using the Health Service Executive (HSE) Change Model risk registers were introduced by initiating, planning, implementing and mainstreaming the change project. Tools such as force field, Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) and stakeholder analyses were employed. A multidisciplinary project team was established and team meetings were held every two to three weeks until risk registers were introduced. The organisation’s risk register template was made available on the hospital intranet for each unit manager to build the risk register. Workshops were held at clinical unit level and also at senior staff monthly meetings to educate staff regarding risk identification, qualitative analysis and evaluation. Action learning and the Plan, Do, Study, Act cycle were used to achieve implementation. Audit of team members’ knowledge and experience of risk registers showed improved knowledge following the project as was the risk awareness and safety culture of staff following workshops.

This study quantifies the impact of residency restrictions on housing options for registered sex offenders using Orange County, Florida, as a case study. A Geographic Information System (GIS) is employed to identify all occupied residential properties using parcel-level zoning data {{as well as those}} that fall within the 1, 000 -foot restricted buffer zones around attractions, bus stops, daycares, parks, and schools.

The limited options to establish residency exist mostly in low-density rural areas. This supports the argument that residency restrictions for sexual offenders are a strong contributing factor to their social and economic isolation.
