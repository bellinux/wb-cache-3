40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that species-specific pit properties such as pit membrane thickness, pit membrane porosity, torus-to-aperture diameter ratio and <b>pit</b> <b>chamber</b> depth influence xylem vulnerability to cavitation. Despite the indisputable importance of using mean pit characteristics, considerable variability in pit structure within a single species or even within a single pit field should be acknowledged. According to the rare pit hypothesis, a single pit that is more air-permeable than many neighboring pits is sufficient to allow air-seeding. Therefore, any irregularities or morphological abnormalities in pit structure allowing air-seeding should be associated with increased vulnerability to cavitation. Considering the currently proposed models of air-seeding, pit features such as rare, large pores in the pit membrane, torus extensions, and plasmodesmatal pores in a torus can represent potential glitches. These aberrations in pit structure could either result from inherent developmental flaws, or from damage caused to the pit membrane by chemical and physical agents. This suggests the existence of interesting feedbacks between abiotic and biotic stresses in xylem physiology...|$|E

Here we present force–displacement measurements for pit membranes of circular bordered pits, collected on a mesomechanical testing system. The system consists of a quartz microprobe attached to a micro-force sensor that is positioned and advanced with a micromanipulator mounted on an inverted microscope. Membrane displacement is measured from digital image analysis. Unaspirated pits from earlywood of never-dried wood of Larix and Pinus and aspirated pits from earlywood of dried wood of Larix were tested to generate force– displacement curves up to the point of membrane failure.

40|$|Wood extractives, {{commonly}} referred to as pitch, cause major problems in the manufacturing of pulp and paper. Treatment of nonsterile southern yellow pine chips for 14 days with Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudo-monas sp., Xanthomonas campestris, and Serratia marcescens reduced wood extractives by as much as 40 %. Control treatments receiving only water lost 11 % of extractives due to the growth of naturally occurring microorganisms. Control treatments were visually discolored after the 14 -day incubation, whereas bacterium-treated wood chips were free of dark staining. Investigations using P. fluorescens NRRL B 21432 showed that all individual resin and fatty acid components of the pine wood extractives were substantially reduced. Micro-morphological observations showed that bacteria were able to colonize resin canals, ray parenchyma cells, and tracheids. Tracheid pit membranes within bordered <b>pit</b> <b>chambers</b> were degraded after treatment with P. fluo-rescens NRRL B 21432. P. fluorescens and the other bacteria tested appear to have the potential for biological processing to substantially reduce wood extractives in pine wood chips prior to the paper making process so that problems associated with pitch in pulp mills can be controlled. Extractives in wood are often referred to as pitch, and these substances can consist of resin and fatty acids and other ma-terials that are soluble in neutral, nonpolar organic solvent...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of vestured pits in angiosperms is briefly reviewed. In some major clades, {{the character is}} of constant occurrence and thus very conservative; in others, it is more variable and apparently subject to both parallel origins and reversible losses. There is a striking correlation between the type of vessel perforation plate and vestured pits. Virtually all taxa with vestured pits have simple perforation plates. This correlation, together with contrasting ecological trends for scalariform perforation plates and vestured pits, has inspired functional hypotheses that vestured pits contribute to hydraulic safety. Whereas scalariform perforations may be instrumental in reducing the effects of freezing-induced embolisms in temperate to boreal and alpine regions, vestured pits {{seem to be a}} good candidate to facilitate embolism reversal in xeric and warmer regions with high transpiration rates. The presence of highly lignified structures within the <b>pit</b> <b>chamber</b> may influence hydraulic resistance, decrease vulnerability to cavitation, or help to repair embolism by compartmentalizing or affecting the contact angle of the convex air-water interface within intervessel pits. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Vestures {{are small}} {{projections}} from the secondary cell wall associated with tracheary {{elements of the}} secondary xylem. They are usually associated with bordered pits and characterize various angiosperm families, including important timber species such as Dipterocarpaceae and Eucalyptus trees. The micromorphology and distribution of vestures is studied in 22 species representing all families within the order Myrtales based on light and scanning electron microscopy. Vestures are consistently present near the outer pit aperture of bordered vessel pits, suggesting the synapomorphic character of this feature for the entire order. It is unclear in which geological period this feature originated {{in the evolution of}} the pre-Myrtalean lineages. In some species vestures are associated with inner pit apertures, inner vessel walls, simple perforation plates, depressions of the cell wall, and bordered pits of tracheids or fibre-tracheids. A compact network of branched vestures almost completely filling the entire <b>pit</b> <b>chamber</b> is the most common vestured pit type in Myrtales, although considerable variation may occur within a wood sample. The micromorphology of vestures seems to some extent correlated with quantitative pit characters. Understanding the exact function of vestured pits with respect to hydraulic efficiency and safety remains a challenge. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Bordered pits play an {{important}} role in permitting water flow among adjacent tracheary elements in flowering plants. Variation in the bordered pit structure is suggested to be adaptive in optimally balancing the conflict between hydraulic efficiency (conductivity) and safety from air entry at the pit membrane (air seeding). The possible function of vestured pits, which are bordered pits with protuberances from the secondary cell wall of the <b>pit</b> <b>chamber,</b> could be increased hydraulic resistance or minimized vulnerability to air seeding. These functional hypotheses have to be harmonized with the notion that the vestured or nonvestured nature of pits contains strong phylogenetic signals (i. e., often characterize large species-rich clades with broad ecological ranges). A literature survey of 11, 843 species covering 6, 428 genera from diverse climates indicates that the incidence of vestured pits considerably decreases from tropics to tundra. The highest frequencies of vestured pits occur in deserts and tropical seasonal woodlands. Moreover, a distinctly developed network of branched vestures is mainly restricted to warm habitats in both mesic and dry (sub) tropical lowlands, whereas vestures in woody plants from cold and boreal arctic environments are usually minute and simple. A similar survey of the frequency of exclusively scalariform perforation plates illustrates that the major ecological trend of this feature is opposite that of vestured pits. These findings provide previously undescribed insights suggesting that vessels with vestured pits and simple perforation plates function as an efficient hydraulic system in plants growing in warm environments with periodical or continuous drought stress. status: publishe...|$|E
30|$|Pyrolytic {{preparations}} of nanometals, such as zinc or copper, affect several elemental {{characteristics such}} as size, charge and dispersion properties {{in such a way}} that may improve their properties for wood preservation compared to similar soluble preparations [8]. Nanometals created by pyrolysis demonstrate precisely controlled particle size in the 1 – 100 -nanometer range that may improve penetrability of the chemical into wood relative to nanometals prepared by milling. Nanometer-size particles of metals have increased surface area when evenly dispersed in a layer. If the particle size was smaller than the diameter of the wood window pit (< 10, 000 nm) or the opening of the bordered pit (400 – 600 nm), complete penetration and uniform distribution would be expected [9]. Nanoparticles demonstrate high dispersion stability, but in concentrated form, they are subject to Van der Waals forces. Surfactants are typically added to increase dispersion stability thereby enabling liquid dispersion of higher concentrations of nanometals. Matsunaga et al. [10] conducted a study on microdistribution of a micronized copper wood preservative (10 – 700 nm). They observed numerous particle deposits of copper in ray tracheids and pit lumens within the wood. These deposits created a different microdistribution pattern in wood treated with the micronized copper than was observed in wood treated with other copper-based preservatives. Fixation of micronized copper is believed to occur primarily through deposition in <b>pit</b> <b>chambers</b> and on tertiary cell wall layers rather than via chemical reaction [9].|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{increasing}} pressure difference (DeltaP) on intervessel pit membrane porosity was studied in two angiosperm tree species with differing pit architecture. Fraxinus americana L. possesses typical angiosperm bordered pit structure while Sophora japonica L. exhibits well-developed vestures in intervessel <b>pit</b> <b>chambers.</b> It was hypothesized (a) that large DeltaP across intervessel pits {{would cause the}} deflection of pit membranes in the stems of F. americana resulting in significant increases in porosity and thus lower cavitation thresholds, and (b) {{that the presence of}} vestures would prevent the deflection of pit membranes in S. japonica. To determine if the porosity of pit membranes increased under mechanical stress, suspensions of colloidal gold, 5 nm and 20 nm in diameter, were perfused across intervessel pit membranes at DeltaP ranging from 0. 25 MPa to 6. 0 MPa. The effect of increasing DeltaP on membrane porosity was also tested by comparing air seeding thresholds (P-a) in stems perfused with water or a solution with lower surface tension. Air seeding and colloidal gold experiments indicated that pit membrane porosity increased significantly with DeltaP in F. americana. In S. japonica, increases in permeability to colloidal gold with DeltaP were small and maximum pore diameters predicted from P-a were independent of DeltaP, suggesting that vestures limited {{the degree to which the}} membrane can be deflected from the centre of the pit cavity. This provides the first experimental evidence that vestures reduce the probability of air seeding through pit membranes. status: publishe...|$|R

Franco] bark is a raw {{material}} produced in our renewable forests along with wood, {{an understanding of}} the ultrastructure of bark cells is of paramount importance if wood technologists are to utilize the bark to the fullest potential. The objectives of this study were to develop microscopic techniques in order to 1) describe and illustrate ultrastructurally the anatomy of parenchyma cells present in phloem and changes that occur to them in rhytidome formation, 2) describe and illustrate pitting between sclereids and adjacent cells. To accomplish these objectives required the development of procedures. Standard techniques were used, modified and integrated with newly developed techniques. Micromanipulation of cells and tissues was required. Stereo, light, phase contrast, fluorescence, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy were employed. The developed procedures resulted in successful bark preparations for ultrastructural examination. The results of this study showed that the longitudinal phloem parenchyma are connected by thin pit areas similar to primary pit fields and not by well defined simple pits as found between parenchyma cells in the xylem. The cell wall of the longitudinal parenchyma is a layered structure with orientated microfibrils. Expansion of the phloem parenchyma with rhytidome formation involves a stretching out of wrinkled and folded cell walls to fully expanded and smooth cell walls. Pitting between a sclereid and a parenchyma cell consists of a long pit canal through the sclereid wall about one micrometer wide with little or no flaring out at the outer surface to form a <b>pit</b> <b>chamber.</b> The pit membrane is the original double cell wall of the parenchyma. Pitting between two sclereids exhibited similar long pit canals extending across the sclereids into a chamber area separated again by a thick pit membrane consisting of the original double cell wall of the parenchyma.

30|$|Figure  3 c {{displays}} the pore volume calculated using the logarithm of the differential pore diameters. The log-differential distribution curves of untreated wood and THM wood with CR 50 showed a multimodal characteristic, while the THM woods with CRs above 60 % {{only had a}} unimodal feature. The peak values obtained at pore diameters such as 32.4, 3492.8, and 8056.2  nm for the untreated wood and 284.2  nm for THM wood with CR 50 indicated the inflection point of pore volume change. For untreated wood, the segment of the curve with the high slope corresponding to the pore sizes of 8506.2  nm might reflect the vessels. The peaks obtained at about 3492.8 and 32.4  nm reflected the lumens of tracheids or libriform fibers and the pointed ends of the fibers [20]. In THM wood with CR 50, the peak obtained at about 284.2  nm showed that the cumulative pore volume had reached the high value and stabilized basically. It {{is obvious that the}} proportion of fibers and tracheids was higher than that of vessels (shown in Fig.  2). These pore diameters corresponded to the pointed ends of the tracheids and the <b>pit</b> <b>chambers</b> present significantly in the vessel walls [19].

The mostly unpublished results of the salvage excavations at Tall Knedig serve as the fundamental basis for the interpretation of the settlement functions (Chapter 2). The excavations brought to light 14 architectural units, including some storage buildings (three round silos and one multicellular building). In the houses many installations and objects were found which indicate domestic activities like food preparation (fire places, tannours, grinding stones) and also storing (<b>pits,</b> <b>chambers</b> or storage jars). The economic analysis has shown that the households from Tall Knedig had an agricultural background, indicators for craft specialization, however, could not be proven. The storage structures suggest that most households could either store their yearly requirements of grain or even had capacity for some reserves. A few storage facilities had clearly more capacity then was used for the needs of their associated households. Bricked-up entrances as well as other features lead to the assumption that some of the inhabitants of Tall Knedig used their houses only seasonally. The settlement was surrounded by a massive brick wall during the first half of the third millennium. In Chapter 3 all other excavated sites of the Lower Habur region with traces of occupation from the era are discussed. Aside from Tall Knedig twelve settlements - partly with extensive storage facilities - were excavated. From the inventory of some of these so called store rooms it is concluded that not all of them were used exclusively for storage purposes. To get a more precise picture of the relations between these settlements it was necessary to develop a regional chronological framework for the first half of the third millennium (Chapter 4). The sequence of the pottery and other characteristics permit a subdivision in three phases. Moreover it is outlined how the urban centres of the adjacent regions correspond with these chronological phases. In Chapter 5 the settlements in the Lower Habur valley, recorded during two survey seasons by the Tübinger Atlas des Vorderen Orients, are analysed. The surface material indicates that nine further sites - in addition to the excavated settlements - were occupied during the first half of the third millennium. The material of a number of sites provides no clear evidence for settlement activities. Most of the settlements along the river valley were small villages of less than one ha in size, whereas only one larger village (Tall Knedig, 3 ha) and one small town (Tall Bderi, 6 ha) could be identified. The vast majority of the sites were situated in the northern part of the Lower Habur region. In the southern river valley only a few settlements were located - at a long but equal distance from each other. The study of the sites has shown that their subsistence, based on farming, livestock (including seasonally migratory herders) and hunting, was to a high degree dependent on the ecological conditions. These were (and still are) characterized by variabilities which caused to a certain degree a flexibility in the economical behaviour. This is reflected to some extent by the numerous storage facilities. There are so far no indications for the assumption, that the rural sites in the Lower Habur valley were tied to large urban centres outside the region...|$|R
50|$|Only {{a handful}} of these submachineguns had been ordered for trial purposes, when in July 1928 the Soviet Army {{leadership}} decided that a single new automatic cartridge should be developed for both automatic pistols and submachine guns, to be obtained by modifying the 7.63×25mm Mauser round down to the Soviet machinery standard of 7.62 mm. Tokarev had to adapt his design to this new ammunition. By then, the competition had been joined by designs from Degtyarev and Korovin, who designed their weapons directly for the new round. Trials were conducted in July 1930, <b>pitted</b> Tokarev models <b>chambered</b> for both rounds against these other two domestic competitors. The Army commission was rather dissatisfied with all guns presented at this trial. Eventually, in Feb 1931, the army ordered 500 Tokarevs chambered in the revolver round, {{to be sent to}} the troops for more extensive trials. The feedback received from the troops was apparently negative. The number of Tokarev submachineguns (chambered in the Nagant round) actually produced and delivered remains uncertain.|$|R
40|$|The {{morphological}} {{structure and}} morphology of the olfactory organs in a freshwater, aquatic breathing fish, Catla catla (Ham.) has been described. It {{consists of two}} nasal openings {{on each side of}} the head, the anterior and posterior nasal opening with a prominent nasal flap in between. A pair of olfactory rosettes is lodged in the depression called olfactory <b>pits</b> or olfactory <b>chambers.</b> The olfactory rosettes are oval, cup shaped structures. Each rosette bears a series of olfactory lamellae {{on each side of the}} median raphe. A single lamella is a flat, bifid tongue like structure. Measurements of the dimension of olfactory rosettes have been made and the data were analysed with respect to body weight using logarithmic transformations, Y = awb. The total number of lamellae in the olfactory rosette increased with increase in body weight. With unit increase in body weight, the total number of lamellae increased by a power (b) of 0. 2603, while the total surface area of lamellae increased by power of (b) 0. 636. Both the parameters showed highly significant correlation coefficient i. e. r = 0. 9894; P < 0. 001 and r = 0. 95218; P < 0. 001 respectively...|$|R
