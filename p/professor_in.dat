40|$|This paper {{presents}} a bibliometric {{evaluation of the}} research performance of tenured <b>Professors</b> <b>in</b> Civil Engineering Departments of six Portuguese Universities using Scopus/Elsevier database. The research performance of Full <b>Professors</b> <b>in</b> Civil Engineering Departments at the Imperial College London (ICL) and MIT was used as benchmark. The bibliometric indexes used in this assessment were the number of papers in SCI journals, ratio SCI papers/year, number of citations (self-citations excluded); ratio citations/SCI paper, h-index, ratio h-index/year, self-citations percentage and uncitedeness rate. Results show that only the Portuguese Civil Engineering Professor with the highest h-index exceeds the average h-index of Full <b>Professors</b> <b>in</b> ICL and almost reach the average h-index of Full <b>Professors</b> <b>in</b> MIT. Top 5 % Portuguese Full Professors have more citations and also a higher ratio citations/SCI papers than their counterparts at ICL. The comparison between the average performance of the Top 5 % Portuguese Full <b>Professors</b> <b>in</b> the five year period (2009 - 2013) and their counterparts at the ICL and MIT shows that the former produced slightly more papers, received almost the same citations of ICLs and 64 % of the citations received by MITs Top 5 % Full <b>Professors</b> <b>in</b> that period...|$|R
