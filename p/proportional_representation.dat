40|$|Abstract. A <b>proportional</b> contact <b>representation</b> of a {{planar graph}} {{is one where}} each vertex is {{represented}} by a simple polygon with area proportional to a given weight and adjacencies between polygons represent edges between the corresponding pairs of vertices. In this paper we study <b>proportional</b> contact <b>representations</b> that use only rectilinear polygons and contain no unused area or hole. There is an algorithm that gives a hole-free <b>proportional</b> contact <b>representation</b> of a maximal planar graph with 12 -sided rectilinear polygons in O(n log n) time. We improve this result by giving a linear-time algorithm that produces a hole-free <b>proportional</b> contact <b>representation</b> of a maximal planar graph with a 10 -sided rectilinear polygons. For a planar 3 -tree we give a linear-time algorithm for a hole-free <b>proportional</b> contact <b>representation</b> with 8 -sided rectilinear polygons. Furthermore, there exist a planar 3 -tree that requires 8 -sided polygons in any hole-free contact representation with rectilinear polygons. A maximal outerplanar graph admits a hole-free <b>proportional</b> contact <b>representation</b> with rectangles. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{a contact}} {{representation}} of a planar graph, vertices are represented by interior-disjoint polygons and two polygons share a non-empty common boundary when the corresponding vertices are adjacent. In the weighted version, a weight is assigned to each vertex and a contact <b>representation</b> is called <b>proportional</b> if each polygon realizes an area proportional to the vertex weight. In this paper we study <b>proportional</b> contact <b>representations</b> of 4 -connected internally triangulated planar graphs. The best known lower and upper bounds on the polygonal complexity for such graphs are 4 and 8, respectively. We narrow the gap between them by proving {{the existence of a}} representation with complexity 6. We then disprove a 10 -year old conjecture on the existence of a Hamiltonian canonical cycle in a 4 -connected maximal planar graph, which also implies that a previously suggested method for constructing <b>proportional</b> contact <b>representations</b> of complexity 6 for these graphs will not work. Finally we prove that it is NP-hard to decide whether a 4 -connected planar graph admits a <b>proportional</b> contact <b>representation</b> using only rectangles...|$|R
