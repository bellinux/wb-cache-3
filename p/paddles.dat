5|$|Traditionally, Hyderabadi haleem {{is cooked}} {{on a low}} flame of {{firewood}} for up to 12 hours in a bhatti (a cauldron covered with a brick and mud kiln). One or two people are required to stir it continuously with wooden <b>paddles</b> throughout its preparation. For home-made Hyderabadi haleem, a Ghotni (a wooden hand masher) is used to stir it until it reaches a sticky-smooth consistency, similar to minced meat.|$|E
5|$|Kirby's Block Ball is a 1995 action video game, a {{spin-off}} {{from the}} Kirby {{series for the}} Game Boy portable console. It is a Breakout clone; the player controls <b>paddles</b> along the screen's edge to knock a bouncing ball, Kirby, into destructible bricks. The game's 55 levels include power-ups, bonus rounds, and minigames. Kirby's Block Ball was developed by HAL Laboratory and Nintendo R. The team spent half a year revising the gameplay to match Kirby's signature characteristics. Kirby's Block Ball was published by Nintendo first in Japan in 1995, later in Europe, and last in North America in 1996.|$|E

50|$|The British Admiralty used {{diesel-electric}} <b>paddle</b> tugs {{in recent}} times. Each <b>paddle</b> wheel {{was driven by}} an individual electric motor, giving outstanding maneuverability. <b>Paddle</b> tugs were able to more easily {{make use of the}} inherent advantage of side wheel <b>paddle</b> propulsion, having the option to disconnect the clutches that connected the <b>paddle</b> drive shafts as one. This enabled them to turn one <b>paddle</b> ahead and one astern to turn and maneuver quickly.|$|R
5|$|Pong is a {{two-dimensional}} sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across {{the left or}} right side of the screen. They can compete against either a computer-controlled opponent or another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the <b>paddles</b> to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.|$|E
5|$|Rebound is a two-player sports arcade game {{developed}} by Atari, Inc. and released in February 1974. In the game, two players each control <b>paddles</b> {{on either side}} of a volleyball net, with a ball dropped {{from the top of the}} screen. The players bounce the ball back and forth across the net with the goal of scoring points by having the ball reach the bottom or side of the other player's half of the screen, with the trajectory of the ball dependent on where it strikes the paddle. The winner is the first player to reach eleven or fifteen points, depending on the game settings.|$|E
5|$|There {{are good}} {{examples}} of horizontal water mills, also known as Norse or Clack Mills, around Dutch Loch. Originally these were two story buildings with turf roofs, built into banks to give access to the upper floor where the mill-stone was sited. Inside the building there was a fixed lower millstone, and a rotating upper millstone driven by the water falling onto the <b>paddles</b> below. Some were still in use on Papa Stour {{in the early years}} of the 20th century, and there is still a working example of one of these mills on the Burn of Clumlie, at Troswick in the south Mainland of Shetland.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The aim of {{this paper}} is to study and analyze the {{performance}} parameters of conveyor, which is fed coal by the <b>paddle</b> feeders, with use of VFD in <b>paddle</b> feeder motors and comparison with other type of coupling used previously in <b>paddle</b> feeders. <b>Paddle</b> feeders are used in coal handling plant of a thermal power station to evacuate coal from track hoppers. In a track hopper conveyor two no. of <b>paddle</b> feeders are available of the 1250 MT per hour coal evacuation capacity each. Initially the <b>paddle</b> feeders were operated with eddy current couplings, which were very much maintenance prone and costly due to that the same had been replaced with the fluid couplings. The fluid coupling has the fixed speed operation. Hence, the <b>paddle</b> feeders were operated at fixed speed and due to that the coal evacuation from a <b>paddle</b> feeder was fixed and there was no possibilities to run two nos. of <b>paddle</b> feeders at a time. Now by use of VFD in <b>paddle</b> feeders utilization of the conveyor has increased as two no. of <b>paddle</b> feeders are running at a time and running time of the system reduced. By the use of VFD in <b>paddle</b> feeder motor power consumption is less and same time the coal evacuation also increased...|$|R
5|$|Use of an {{automated}} external defibrillator on a patient in a metal underwire bra can cause burns, and the bra should be removed by the first responder before the AED is applied. In their 2007 season, the television program MythBusters tested the possibility of burns resulting from using a defibrillator on a patient who is using an underwire bra, and concluded that while it is possible, {{it is not likely}} unless the metal underwire is exposed and <b>paddles</b> of the defibrillator are very close to it.|$|E
5|$|Mallory's tenure on the Committee on Naval Affairs {{came during}} a time of great {{innovation}} in naval warfare. He kept abreast of developments in other navies, and he made sure that the U.S. Navy would incorporate the latest thinking into its new ships. Britain and France, then the two foremost navies in the world, {{were in the process of}} converting their fleets from sail to steam, and from <b>paddles</b> to screws. In 1853, the committee recommended passage of a bill providing for the addition of six new screw frigates to the fleet; when delivered, some considered them to be the best frigates in the world. In 1857, his committee persuaded the Senate to authorize twelve sloops-of-war. These entered the navy beginning in 1858, on the verge of the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Rebound is a two-player volleyball sports game {{in which}} the players, each {{controlling}} a paddle representing a person {{on either side of}} a volleyball net, attempt to score points. The horizontal <b>paddles</b> are moved by the players left and right on their side of the net, represented by a short dashed line. The ball, represented by a square dot, is dropped {{from the top of the}} screen in a parabolic arc; if it hits a player's paddle, it bounces in another arc according to where on the paddle it hit. Bounces from closer to the center are more vertical, while those towards the sides move mostly horizontally. This method of changing the angle of deflection is similar to the mechanics of Pong (1972), Atari's first arcade game.|$|E
50|$|Stand up <b>paddle</b> surfing {{and stand}} up <b>paddle</b> {{boarding}} (SUP) is an offshoot of surfing that originated in Hawaii. Unlike traditional surfing where the rider sits until a wave comes, stand up <b>paddle</b> boarders stand on their boards and use a <b>paddle</b> to propel themselves through the water. The sport was documented in a 2013 report that identified it as the outdoor sporting activity with the most first-time participants in the United States that year. Variations include flat water <b>paddling</b> for outdoor recreation, fitness, or sightseeing, racing on lakes, large rivers and canals, surfing on ocean waves, <b>paddling</b> in river rapids (whitewater SUP), <b>Paddle</b> board yoga and even fishing.|$|R

5|$|Sheep {{have been}} raised in the Llŷn Peninsula for over a {{thousand}} years, and Aberdaron has produced and exported wool for many years. The main product locally was felt, produced by soaking the cloth in water and beating it with large wooden <b>paddles</b> until the wool formed a thick mat which could be flattened, dried and cut into lengths. There were two fulling mills on the Afon Daron, in addition to three corn mills, and lichen was gathered around Y Rhiw, from which a grey dye was extracted. Arable crops consisted mainly of wheat, barley, oats and potatoes. The field boundaries date back several centuries and are marked by walls, cloddiau and hedgerows; important habitats {{for a variety of}} wildlife.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{investigation by}} the FBI was aided by another prisoner, Allen West, {{who was part of}} the escapees' group but was left behind. West's false wall kept slipping so he held it in place with cement, which set. When Morris and the Anglins accelerated the schedule, West desperately chipped away at the wall, {{but by the time he}} got out, his companions were gone. Articles belonging to the prisoners, including plywood <b>paddles</b> and parts of the raincoat raft were discovered on nearby Angel Island. The FBI's investigation from 1962 to December 1979 was finally treated as closed. The official report on the escape concludes that the prisoners drowned in the cold waters of the bay while trying to reach the mainland, it being unlikely that they made it the 1.25 miles to shore due to the strong ocean currents and the cold sea water temperatures ranging between 50 and 55 degrees Fahrenheit.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} <b>paddles</b> {{along the}} screen's edges to knock a bouncing ball, Kirby, into destructible bricks. The player loses a life if Kirby hits {{the edge of}} the screen. Each of the game's eleven stages include five rounds of increasingly complex block patterns for Kirby to clear. The ten different block types vary in durability and points value. A well-timed hit of the paddle gives Kirby a powerful bounce to break through harder blocks. Another block type turns the remaining blocks into a bonus round that rewards the player for clearing the screen in the least amount of time. The player can find warp stars that lead to minigames, such as air hockey, where the player can earn extra lives. The rounds also include enemies to attack and avoid. Some enemies contain bonus items. Each stage ends in a boss fight.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, sailing {{ships were}} {{commanded}} from the quarterdeck, aft of the mainmast. With {{the arrival of}} <b>paddle</b> steamers, engineers required a platform from which they could inspect the <b>paddle</b> wheels and where the captain's view would not be obstructed by the <b>paddle</b> houses. A raised walkway, literally a bridge, connecting the <b>paddle</b> houses was therefore provided. When the screw propeller superseded the <b>paddle</b> wheel, the bridge was retained.|$|R

More advanced <b>paddle</b> wheel designs feature feathering methods that keep each <b>paddle</b> blade closer to vertical while in the water to increase efficiency. The upper part of a <b>paddle</b> wheel is normally enclosed in a paddlebox to minimise splashing.|$|R
5|$|Alcorn first {{examined}} Bushnell's schematics for Computer Space, {{but found}} them to be illegible. He went on to create his own designs based on his knowledge of transistor–transistor logic and Bushnell's game. Feeling the basic game was too boring, Alcorn added features to give the game more appeal. He divided the paddle into eight segments to change the ball's angle of return. For example, the center segments return the ball a 90° angle in relation to the paddle, while the outer segments return the ball at smaller angles. He also made the ball accelerate the longer it remained in play; missing the ball reset the speed. Another feature was that the in-game <b>paddles</b> were unable to reach the top of screen. This was caused by a simple circuit that had an inherent defect. Instead of dedicating time to fixing the defect, Alcorn decided it gave the game more difficulty and helped limit the time the game could be played; he imagined two skilled players being able to play forever otherwise.|$|E
5|$|In 1973 a jadeitite axehead {{was found}} {{alongside}} the track; {{it is thought}} to have been placed there as an offering. One of over 100similar axe heads found in Britain and Ireland, its good condition and its precious material suggest that it was a symbolic axe, rather than one used to cut wood. Because of the difficulty of working this material, which was derived from the Alpine area of Europe, all the axe heads of this type found in Great Britain are thought to have been non-utilitarian and to have represented some form of currency or be the products of gift exchange. Radiocarbon dating of the peat in which the axe head was discovered suggests that it was deposited in about 3200 BC. Wooden artefacts found at the site include <b>paddles,</b> a dish, arrow shafts, parts of four hazel bows, a throwing axe, yew pins, digging sticks, a mattock, a comb, toggles, and a spoon fragment. Finds made from other materials, such as flint flakes, arrowheads, and a chipped flint axe (in mint condition) have also been made.|$|E
5|$|Pong was {{the first}} game {{developed}} by Atari. After producing Computer Space, Bushnell decided to form a company to produce more games by licensing ideas to other companies. The first contract was with Bally Manufacturing Corporation for a driving game. Soon after the founding, Bushnell hired Allan Alcorn because of his experience with electrical engineering and computer science; Bushnell and Dabney also had previously worked with him at Ampex. Prior to working at Atari, Alcorn had no experience with video games. To acclimate Alcorn to creating games, Bushnell gave him a project secretly {{meant to be a}} warm-up exercise. Bushnell told Alcorn that he had a contract with General Electric for a product, and asked Alcorn to create a simple game with one moving spot, two <b>paddles,</b> and digits for score keeping. In 2011, Bushnell stated that the game was inspired by previous versions of electronic tennis he had played before; Bushnell played a version on a PDP-1 computer in 1964 while attending college. However, Alcorn has claimed it was in direct response to Bushnell's viewing of the Magnavox Odyssey's Tennis game. In May 1972, Bushnell had visited the Magnavox Profit Caravan in Burlingame, California where he played the Magnavox Odyssey demonstration, specifically the table tennis game. Though he thought the game lacked quality, seeing it prompted Bushnell to assign the project to Alcorn.|$|E

5|$|The Arab fleet under Sulayman (often {{confused}} with the Caliph himself in the medieval sources) arrived on 1 September, anchoring at first near the Hebdomon. Two days later, Sulayman led his fleet into the Bosphorus and the various squadrons began anchoring by the European and Asian suburbs of the city: one part sailed south of Chalcedon to the harbours of Eutropios and Anthemios to watch over the southern entrance of the Bosporus, {{while the rest of}} the fleet sailed into the strait, passed by Constantinople and began making landfall on the coasts between Galata and Kleidion, cutting the Byzantine capital's communication with the Black Sea. But as the Arab fleet's rearguard, twenty heavy ships with 2,000 marines, was passing the city, the southerly wind stopped and then reversed, drifting them towards the city walls, where a Byzantine squadron attacked them with Greek fire. Theophanes reported that some went down with all hands, while others, burning, sailed down to the Princes' Islands of Oxeia and Plateia. The victory encouraged the Byzantines and dejected the Arabs, who, according to Theophanes, had originally intended to sail to the sea walls during the night and try to scale them using the ships' steering <b>paddles.</b> The same night, Leo drew up the chain between the city and Galata, closing the entrance to the Golden Horn. The Arab fleet became reluctant to engage the Byzantines, and withdrew to the safe harbour of Sosthenion further north on the European shore of the Bosporus.|$|E
5|$|The chicks {{take from}} 34 to 50 days to fledge, the period {{depending}} on the abundance of their food supply. In years of fish shortage, the whole colony may experience a longer fledgling period but the normal range is 38 to 44 days, by which time chicks will have reached about 75% of their mature body weight. The chick may come to the burrow entrance to defecate but does not usually emerge into the open and seems to have an aversion to light until it is nearly fully fledged. Although the supply of fish by the adults reduces {{over the last few}} days spent in the nest, the chick is not abandoned as happens in the Manx shearwater. On occasions, an adult has been observed provisioning a nest even after the chick has departed. During the last few days underground, the chick sheds its down and the juvenile plumage is revealed. Its relatively small beak and its legs and feet are a dark colour and it lacks the white facial patches of the adult. The chick finally leaves its nest at night, when the risk of predation is at its lowest. When the moment arrives, it emerges from the burrow, usually for the first time, and walks, runs and flaps its way to the sea. It cannot fly properly yet so descending a cliff is perilous; when it reaches the water it <b>paddles</b> out to sea, and may be three kilometres (two miles) away from the shore by daybreak. It does not congregate with others of its kind and will not return to land for two or three years.|$|E
