5|$|Once the {{handrail}} was removed, Massimino {{went to work}} attaching the capture plate, but ran into additional problems when the battery {{in one of his}} <b>power</b> <b>tools</b> failed. Massimino was instructed to return to the orbiter's airlock to retrieve a spare tool and to recharge his suit's oxygen reserves, to allow for completion of the STIS repair. The rest of the STIS repair work was completed without any problems, but the spacewalkers were nearly two hours behind the scheduled timeline, so managers on the ground decided to postpone the task of installing a New Outer Blanket Layers (NOBLs) onto the telescope's outer shell. The spacewalk, originally scheduled to last six hours and thirty minutes, ended at 21:02 UTC, for a time of eight hours and two minutes. At the time, it became the sixth longest spacewalk in history. It was the twenty-second spacewalk devoted to servicing the Hubble telescope, and Massimino's fourth spacewalk, bringing his total EVA time to thirty hours, forty-four minutes.|$|E
5|$|Upon its October 1974 release, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre {{was banned}} {{outright}} in several countries, and numerous theaters later stopped showing {{the film in}} response to complaints about its violence. While it initially drew a mixed reception from critics, it was enormously profitable, grossing over $30 million at the domestic box office. It has since received a positive reappraisal and gained {{a reputation as one}} of the best and most influential horror films in cinema history. It is credited with originating several elements common in the slasher genre, including the use of <b>power</b> <b>tools</b> as murder weapons and the characterization of the killer as a large, hulking, faceless figure. The popularity of the film led to a franchise that continued the story of Leatherface and his family through sequels, remakes, one prequel, comic books and video games.|$|E

25|$|The {{demand for}} batteries, {{primarily}} nickel-metal-hydride and lithium-ion batteries, {{has caused a}} growth in graphite demand in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This growth was driven by portable electronics, such as portable CD players and <b>power</b> <b>tools.</b> Laptops, mobile phones, tablet, and smartphone products have increased the demand for batteries. Electric vehicle batteries are anticipated to increase graphite demand. As an example, a lithium-ion battery in a fully electric Nissan Leaf contains nearly 40kg of graphite.|$|E

25|$|Found in {{applications}} {{as diverse}} as industrial fans, blowers and pumps, machine tools, household appliances, <b>power</b> <b>tools,</b> and disk drives, electric motors can be powered by direct current (DC) sources, such as from batteries, motor vehicles or rectifiers, or by alternating current (AC) sources, such as from the power grid, inverters or generators. Small motors {{may be found in}} electric watches. General-purpose motors with highly standardized dimensions and characteristics provide convenient mechanical power for industrial use. The largest of electric motors are used for ship propulsion, pipeline compression and pumped-storage applications with ratings reaching 100 megawatts. Electric motors may be classified by electric power source type, internal construction, application, type of motion output, and so on.|$|E
25|$|On April 25, 1989, Staley {{and three}} other activists barricaded {{themselves}} in an office at Burroughs Wellcome in Research Triangle Park, NC to protest the price of AZT (at the time priced at $8,000-$10,000 per year). The four protesters used <b>power</b> <b>tools</b> to bolt metal plates {{to the door of}} an unoccupied office and had planned to drop a banner that would be visible from the nearby highway, Interstate 40, before authorities cut their way through a wall. The protestors then chained themselves together, and were cut apart and charged with trespassing and property damage. Staley, who at the time had been in talks with AZT developer David Barry to lower the price on the drug, would make peace with the company years later, following their $1 million donation to AIDS clinical trials programs in 1992.|$|E
25|$|Tim is a stereotypical American male, {{who loves}} <b>power</b> <b>tools,</b> cars, and sports. In particular, {{he is an}} avid fan of local Detroit teams. In {{numerous}} instances, Tim wears Lions, Pistons, Red Wings, and Tigers clothing, and many plots revolve around the teams. He is a former salesman for the fictional Binford Tool company, and {{is very much a}} cocky, overambitious, accident-prone know-it-all. Witty but flippant, Tim jokes around a lot, even at inappropriate times, much to the dismay of his wife. However, Tim can sometimes be serious when necessary. Jill, Tim's wife, is loving and sophisticated, but not exempt from dumb moves herself. In later seasons she returns to college to study psychology. Family life is boisterous for the Taylors with the two oldest children, Brad and Randy, tormenting the much younger Mark, all while continually testing and pestering each other. Such play happened especially throughout the first three seasons, and was revisited only occasionally until Jonathan Taylor Thomas left {{at the beginning of the}} eighth season. During the show's final season, Brad and Mark became much closer due to Randy's absence.|$|E

40|$|With an {{increase}} in the frequency of extravehicular activities (EVA's) aboard the Space Shuttle, NASA is interested in determining the capabilities of suited astronauts while performing manual tasks during an EVA, in particular the situations in which portable foot restraints are not used to stabilize the astronauts. Efforts were made to document the forces that are transmitted to spacecraft while pushing and pulling an object as well as while operating a standard wrench and an automatic <b>power</b> <b>tool.</b> The six subjects studied aboard the KC- 135 reduced gravity aircraft were asked to exert a maximum torque and to maintain a constant level of torque with a wrench, to push and pull an EVA handrail, and to operate a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) <b>power</b> <b>tool.</b> The results give an estimate of the forces and moments that an operator will transmit to the handrail {{as well as to the}} supporting structure. In general, it was more effective to use the tool inwardly toward the body rather than away from the body. There were no differences in terms of strength capabilities between right and left hands. The <b>power</b> <b>tool</b> was difficult to use. It is suggested that ergonomic redesigning of the <b>power</b> <b>tool</b> may increase the efficiency of <b>power</b> <b>tool</b> use...|$|R

25|$|An {{advantage}} of the universal motor is that AC supplies may be used on motors that have some characteristics more common in DC motors, specifically high starting torque and very compact design if high running speeds are used. The negative aspect is the maintenance and short life problems caused by the commutator. Such motors are used in devices, such as food mixers and <b>power</b> <b>tools,</b> that are used only intermittently, and often have high starting-torque demands. Multiple taps on the field coil provide (imprecise) stepped speed control. Household blenders that advertise many speeds frequently combine a field coil with several taps and a diode that can be inserted in series with the motor (causing the motor to run on half-wave rectified AC). Universal motors also lend themselves to electronic speed control and, as such, are an ideal choice for devices like domestic washing machines. The motor {{can be used to}} agitate the drum (both forwards and in reverse) by switching the field winding with respect to the armature.|$|E
25|$|So that {{manufacturers}} {{need not}} build, distribute and maintain many similar appliances differing {{only in the}} type of plug fitted, a common strategy is to provide an IEC 60320 inlet on the appliance and a detachable power cord (mains flex lead) to allow connection of the appliance to the socket. The appliance need only to be tested to the power inlet. Some types of appliance require the consumer to also change a switch to adapt to different voltages or frequency. In addition to sockets permanently attached to building wiring, extension cords (extension leads) are used for temporary connections when a socket is not within convenient reach of an appliance's power lead. Portable equipment such as gardening <b>power</b> <b>tools</b> may have a male power inlet compatible with the connector {{at the end of an}} extension cord; this allows one long cord to be shared among several tools, and so saves storage space and cost for the consumer. Multiple small appliances may be connected to sockets on a power strip, which can also include switching, surge voltage and over-current protection; a power strip equipped with different series of plug and sockets can act as an adaptor for imported equipment.|$|E
