40|$|Introduction: Chronic pain in {{the abdomen}} occurs as a {{consequence}} of malignancy in these parts of the body, surgical, of radiological and chemotherapy treatments. It may also be as a result of relapse of the basic process. Non-invasive therapy of oral and transdermal analgesic was successful for some time, where necessary applies and epidural catheter. Case Report: The patient had a diagnosis of chronic postoperative pain malignant etiology. He is already used transdermal fentanyl and Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs, but without success (VAS score 8 - 10). We increased doses of analgesics, but without success. In order of pain therapy, <b>peridural</b> <b>catheter</b> placed in the level L 3 - L 4. 5 ml of a solution of 8 ml of 0. 25 % bupivacaine, 2 ml (100 micrograms) of fentanyl and 10 ml of saline was administered every 6 hours through epidural catheter. The former chronic non-invasive treatment of pain did not stop. The first three to five days of pain relief was quite satisfactory in this way. Then the pain intensified but the <b>peridural</b> <b>catheter</b> had to be removed due to local infection. New <b>peridural</b> <b>catheter</b> was placed in the level L 2 -L 3. Then, 5 ml of the solution: of 8 ml 0, 25 % bupivacaine, 2 ml (100 micrograms) of fentanyl and 10 ml of saline is administered through <b>peridural</b> <b>catheter.</b> <b>Peridural</b> <b>catheter</b> was total used for 45 days. We had a need for more and more frequently administering analgesics through a catheter during use. The patient was using transdermal fentanyl and Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs, all the time. The patient soon died due to progression of the underlying disease. Conclusion: After long-term administration of opioids, it is necessary to change the type and route of administration of the drug to achieve the success of the therapy. In this case it was the use of analgesics and local anesthetics through the <b>peridural</b> <b>catheter...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundCerebrospinal fluid {{cutaneous}} fistula following {{spinal anaesthesia}} {{is a serious}} and rare complication which requires a prompt diagnosis. However, the treatment management is not well defined. Clinical caseFemale aged 50 with a stage IIB cervical carcinoma, who had a <b>peridural</b> <b>catheter</b> inserted at lumbar level. Three days after surgery she refers severe headache, which was corroborated by leakage of cerebrospinal fluid through the puncture. She was prescribed antibiotics and acetazolamide 250 mg every 8 hours for five days with a favourable outcome. ConclusionIn this case, management with acetazolamide and suture of the fistula inhibits cerebrospinal fluid leakage, {{without the need for}} a blood patch...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Spontaneous {{epidural}} hematoma {{of the spine}} (SEHS) is an extremely rare entity. Patients known to have thrombophilia or on anticoagulant drugs are the most affected. It is generally caused by a rupture of the postero-internal vertebral venous plexus secondary to minor barotrauma such as cough, <b>peridural</b> <b>catheter</b> insertion [...] . Early diagnosis and treatment showed {{to have the best}} outcome. Cases report: We report 3 cases of spontaneous {{epidural hematoma}} in patients treated by acenocoumarol, which occurred without any provocative factor. All 3 patients were treated with decompressive laminectomy. Discussion: We described the MRI findings and discussed the spontaneity of the entity. Our present case studies and the review of the literature showed that early diagnosis and management of SEHS can lead to improvement of the neurological state and avoid definitive motor and sensitive deficit. Conclusion: This rare entity should be suspected in every acute medullary syndrome with spinal pain, motor and/or sensory deficit. In order to decrease the sequelae, neurologically unstable patients should benefit from early diagnosis and urgent surgical decompression...|$|E
40|$|Patient-controlled {{analgesia}} (PCA) is {{a delivery}} system with which patients self-administer predetermined doses of analgesic medication to relieve their pain. Since its introduction {{in the early}} 1980 s, the daily management of postoperative pain has been extensively optimised. The use of PCA in hospitals has been increasing because of its proven advantages over conventional intramuscular injections. These include improved pain relief, greater patient satisfaction, less sedation and fewer postoperative complications. All PCA modes contain the following variables: initial loading dose, demand dose, lockout interval, background infusion rate and 1 -hour or 4 -hour limits. Morphine is the most studied and most commonly used intravenous drug for PCA. In {{spite of the fact}} that it is the 'first choice' for PCA, other opioids have been successfully used for this option. The most observed adverse effects of opioid-based PCA are nausea and vomiting, pruritus, respiratory depression, sedation, confusion and urinary retention. Although intravenous PCA is the most studied route of PCA, alternative routes have extensively been described in the literature. PCA by means of <b>peridural</b> <b>catheters</b> and peripheral nerve catheters are the most studied. Recently, transdermal PCA has been described. The use of peripheral or neuraxial nerve blocks is recommended to avoid the so called opioid tolerance observed with the intravenous administration of opioids. Numerous studies have shown the superiority of epidural PCA to intravenous PCA. The beneficial postoperative effects of epidural analgesia are more apparent for high-risk patients or those undergoing higher risk procedures. PCA with peripheral nerve catheters results in increased postoperative analgesia and satisfaction for surgery on upper and lower extremities. Serious complications occur rarely with these catheters. With the introduction of an Acute Pain Service, management of postoperative pain can be improved. This will also help to minimise adverse effects related to PCA and to avoid lethal mishaps...|$|R
40|$|Traced and {{interpreted}} is the dynamic and correlative {{relations between the}} values of certain biochemical parameters of the homeostasis connected with cell metabolism in skeletal muscles so a verification of tissue ischemia (TI) and ischemic tissue lesion (ITL) can be performed. The target group is patients with quantitative violations in consciousness and <b>peridural</b> <b>catheters</b> placed for anesthesia, with the suspicion that an acute arterial obstruction in the limbs (AAOL) has occurred, or one has already been verified. Test of the serum levels of CK; CK (MB); ASAT; ALAT and Myoglobin were initially performed and were monitored in dynamic. A valuation of the ASAT/ALAT index in close correlation with the other parameters and clinical course of the disease was also performed. A particular dynamic and correlation, before the operation, after the timely revascularization, during the development of ischemic gangrene and after the amputation on an optimal level, was observed. We found an acute elevation of the enzyme activity of CK; CK (MB) and ASAT {{in the case of}} AAOL which generated TI. ALAT and Myoglobin remained in the reference ranges. In cases with unsuccessful, late or impossible revascularization and transition to TI and ITL (ischemic rhabdomyolysis) we found progressive elevation in the levels of the parameters being monitored, including ALAT and Myoglobin. The registered values, in the patients who were not operated, before death, were 900 times above for CK, and CK (MB) did not exceed 5 % of CK. Over 100 times the standard value for ASAT and ALAT without and hepatic pathology and acute coronary incident. The ASAT/ALAT index is extremely positive in the group with ITL. The registered values of serum Myoglobin reached up to 70 times above the reference range. Upon, revascularization, amputation on an optimal level or an experienced gangrene, a rapid decrease in the values to the reference range for a period 24 - 48 hours, was observed, except for ALAT, it normalized after 2 - 3 days. In cases with ischemic gangrene the ASAT/ALAT index from extremely positive in the beginning (> 3. 0 - 5. 0) progressively decreased due to the rapid elevation of the values of ALAT with permanently high ASAT. The significant changes and correlative relations of the monitored parameters have distinct differences in cases with reversible TI and irreversible ITL, forming typical laboratory constellations in all of the controlled cases. This gives sufficient {{reason to believe that the}} implemented approach can form the basis of an objective method for early detection and monitoring of TI and ischemic tissue damage in AAOL in the target patient population for good clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the benefit of {{perioperative}} epidural anaesthesia in total knee arthroplasty. Is there a better early rehabilitation outcame and on the other side does it have a negative influence on the complication rate and the perioperative blood loss? Method: The study was randomised and prospectively conducted. 39 patient got an epidural catheter for the operation with was reactivated with a single shot injection on the day after the operation. Therefore a painless passive mobilisation of the operated kneewas possible untill 120 degrees of flection. The 17 patients of the control group underwent the operation in general anaesthesia with conventionel parenteral postoperative analgesia. Each patient was examined with the help of a standardized examination protocol on day before the operation and after one, two and sixteen weeks. Results: There was a significantly better flection with <b>peridural</b> <b>catheter</b> postoperativ after one and two weeks. Also significantly better was the walking range after one and sixteen weeks after the operation. There was no significant difference in the score of Lysholm and Gillquist. There was an increased rate of complications in the study group, first of all cases of delayed wound healing. Conclusion: The usage of the epidural catheter is an option to consider in perioperative knee arthroplasty. However the increased rate of complications is a concern...|$|E
40|$|We {{would like}} to thank Rychlik et al. [1] for their {{interest}} regard-ing our comparative study about postoperative ipsilateral shoulder pain treatment and prevention [2]. The idea of injecting the periphrenic fat pad prior to resection and handling of the hilium seems to be very interesting to us, and probably will lead to a better control of postthoracotomy ipsilateral shoulder pain as has been well documented with the use preemptive analgesia through <b>peridural</b> <b>catheter</b> in thoracic (and others) surgeries [3, 4]. In contrast, even though we agree with Rychlik et al. [1] that levobupivacaine is a theoretically better agent for phrenic nerve block (longer half-time live and more powerful effect) than lido-caine, we {{would like to}} reflect our concerns about its clinical use because of its potential cardiotoxicity in case of systemic absorp-tion that is something that could occur with its use in a well-vascularized area as the periphrenic fat pad. Regarding this matter, we believe that ropivacaine would be a better option than lidocaine or levobupivacaine because it’s a long-lasting, powerful anaesthetic with less cardiac toxicity [5], and it has proved safety in a clinical setting for phrenic nerve block [6]; unfortunately, we have no experience with this anaesthetic. Finally, we concur that further research is necessary to refine the technique of phrenic nerve infiltration for ipsilateral shoulder pain, but we strongly believe that actually there is enough evidence to recommend the widespread of the technique all over the thoracic surgery units...|$|E
40|$|Adequate pain {{control is}} {{paramount}} to timely postoperative convalescence and patient’s contentment. The {{aim of this}} study is to compare pre- and operative application of analgesics in regard to postoperative pain relief in patients who had undergone thorax surgery. Peridural anaesthesia (PDA) is a major pillar in modern postoperative pain control. It remained unclear, however, whether additional pre- or operative loading of the catheter granted a benefit in comparison to mere postoperative loading. Furthermore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of preemptive parenteral Clonidine in combination with an opioid. Patients and method Sixty patients were included into this prospective, randomized, monocentric, placebo controlled study. They were to undergo an elective lung resection (in part or total) at the Charité university hospital, Campus Mitte. The patients were divided into three groups. Twenty patients each were administered either Remifentanyl intravenously, Remifentanyl + Clonidine intravenously or Ropivacaine epidurally. Administration was carried out double-blinded. Thorax surgery was performed using either lateral thoracotomy or VATS. Patient’s pain assessment was registered immediately after surgery as well as three days consecutively using the NRS-Scale. The degrees of pain at rest and in movement were noted. Movement in this case meant letting the patient cough. Likewise, postoperative loading of the <b>peridural</b> <b>catheter</b> (measured in ml/h) and requirement of additional pain medication were registered. Results NRS-Scores immediately postoperative were, albeit statistically insignificantly, lower in the group who had received PDA preoperative compared to the other two groups who had been administered PDA postoperatively. The group of patients who had received Ropivacaine preoperatively had an insignificantly lower requirement of additional pain medication on the day of the operation. Preemptive administration of parenteral Clonidine combined with Remifentanyl did not result in a lower NRS-Score or requirement of additional pain medication. Conclusion This study did not show a significant benefit of preemptive analgesia through epidural Ropivacaine or parenteral Clonidine in patients who have undergone thorax surgery. However, our data indicates a reduced pain intensity and demand for pain medication postoperatively due to pre- and operative PDA. Low numbers of patients and identical postoperative treatment with thoracic PDA may be the reason for the lack of statistically insignificant results in this study. Furthermore, this study supports the assumption that VATS is a less painful intervention compared to lateral thoracotomy. Therefore, from an anaesthesiological perspective, VATS is preferable...|$|E
40|$|Objetivo. Este estudio fue diseñado para establecer las diferencias entre la anestesia general y la peridural en colecistectomía laparoscópica. Métodos. Se trata de un estudio clínico experimental, aleatorio, comparativo y prospectivo. Participaron 52 pacientes, ASA 1 y 2, programados para colecistectomía laparoscópica en la Clínica Universitaria Teletón. Los dos grupos recibieron premedicación con dipirona, ondansetrón y dexametasona. Al grupo asignado a anestesia peridural se le realizó punción en T 9 -T 10 y se le aplicó anestesia con lidocaína al 2 % con epinefrina (100 mg) y bupivacaína al 0, 5 % sin epinefrina (25 mg), dejando el catéter peridural. Recibieron sedación transoperatoria con remifentanilo. Al grupo con anestesia general se le practicó una inducción convencional con propofol, remifentanilo y rocuronio. El mantenimiento anestésico se hizo con remifentanilo en infusión y sevofluorano, y se sometió a intubación orotraqueal. En ambos grupos, la {{analgesia}} transoperatoria se mantuvo con morfina y se hizo instilación subdiafragmática de bupivacaína al 0, 25 %. Para la analgesia posoperatoria se usó tramadol y acetaminofén. En todos los pacientes se evaluaron los signos vitales transoperatorios. En el grupo de la anestesia peridural se evaluó la presencia de dolor abdominal, dolor de espalda, dolor en hombro, náuseas, vómito y dificultad respiratoria en el transoperatorio. En el postoperatorio de los dos grupos, se evaluó la presencia de dolor en la herida quirúrgica, dolor en hombro, dolor de espalda, náuseas, vómito, cefalea y dificultad respiratoria a los 0, 30, 60 y 90 minutos, y a las 6, 24 y 72 horas. En el postoperatorio, se registraron las cantidades los totales de morfina que se requirieron. Resultados. Se presentaron diferencias significativas en los valores de saturación de O 2 (p Objective: This {{study was}} designed to establish the differences between general and peridural anesthesia in laparoscopic colecistectomy. Methods: Randomized clinical trial. Participants: 52 patients, ASA 1 and 2 programmed for laparoscopic colecistectomy at the Clínica Universitaria Teletón. Both groups received premedication with dipirona, ondansetron and dexametasona. In the group assigned to peridural anesthesia punction was carried out at the T 9 -T 10 level, anesthesia with 2 % lidocain with epinephrine (100 mg) and 0. 5 % bupivacain without epinephrine, 25 mg, leaving <b>peridural</b> <b>catheter.</b> Transoperatory Sedation was done with with remifentanyl. To the group with general anesthesia was practiced a conventional induction with Propofol, Remifentanil and Rocuronio. Anesthetic maintenance with Remifentanil in infusion and Sevofluorano. Orotraqueal intubation. Transoperative analgesia in both groups with morphine. Subdiafragmatic instilation of Bupivacaina 0. 25 % in both groups. Postoperative analgesia with Tramadol and Acetaminofen. Vital signs during transoperative process were evaluated in both groups. In the group of peridural anesthesia, presence of abdominal pain, back pain, shoulder pain, nausea, vomit and breathing difficulty in the transoperatory period were evaluated. In the postoperative for two groups the presence in surgical wound, shoulder pain, back pain, nausea, vomit, migraine, breathing difficulty at times of 0, 30, 60, 90 minutes, 6, 24 and 72 hours were evaluated too. Total requirements of morphine in the postoperative period were registered. Results: Significant differences were presented in the values of Sat O 2 (p < 0. 05) which were smaller in the group of peridural and CO 2 (p < 0. 05) that increased significantly from the dissection of the vesicle {{until the end of the}} surgery in the group of peridural 13 % of the cases with peridural anesthesia required conversion to general anesthesia. In the group of peridural anesthesia the shoulder pain was the most frequent nuisance (80 %). The postoperative pain in the surgical place was smaller in the group of peridural at 0, 30 and 60 min (p < 0. 05); in the other evaluated times there was any difference among the groups. As for back pain and of shoulder significant differences were not presented in the postoperative period; the same thing happened to the requirements of morphine. The values of Cortisol increased significantly with regard to the basal ones in the group of peridural (p < 0. 05). In conclusion, we are describing an anesthetic technique that is not used frecuently for laparoscopic colecistectomy. We were able to maintain our patients inside some allowed limits of security and of well-being during trans and postoperative period. We didn&# 8217;t have complications to complain neither left out of the common of anesthetic practice. We could demonstrate the decrease of the postoperative pain in the first hour in the group of peridural but we could not diminish the requirements of morphine significantly and neither we could diminish the metabolic answer to the stress with the regional anesthesia. We accept that the general anesthesia is the anesthetic technique of election for laparoscopic colecistectomy in most of patients but we also understand that peridural anesthesia is a possible alternative for those whose risk imposes the election of another technique different to the general one...|$|E
40|$|Water-filtered infrared-A (wIRA) as {{a special}} form of heat {{radiation}} with a high tissue penetration and with a low thermal load to the skin surface acts both by thermal and thermic {{as well as by}} non-thermal and non-thermic effects. wIRA produces a therapeutically usable field of heat in the tissue and increases tissue temperature, tissue oxygen partial pressure, and tissue perfusion. These three factors are decisive for a sufficient tissue supply with energy and oxygen and consequently as well for wound healing and infection defense. wIRA can considerably alleviate the pain (with remarkably less need for analgesics) and diminish an elevated wound exudation and inflammation and can show positive immunomodulatory effects. wIRA can advance wound healing or improve an impaired wound healing both in acute and in chronic wounds including infected wounds. Even the normal wound healing process can be improved. A prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind study with 111 patients after major abdominal surgery at the University Hospital Heidelberg, Germany, showed with 20 minutes irradiation twice a day (starting on the second postoperative day) in the group with wIRA and visible light VIS (wIRA(+VIS), approximately 75 % wIRA, 25 % VIS) compared to a control group with only VIS a significant and relevant pain reduction combined with a markedly decreased required dose of analgesics: during 230 single irradiations with wIRA(+VIS) the pain decreased without any exception (median of decrease of pain on postoperative days 2 - 6 was 13. 4 on a 100 mm visual analog scale VAS 0 - 100), while pain remained unchanged in the control group (p< 0. 001). The required dose of analgesics was 57 - 70 % lower in the subgroups with wIRA(+VIS) compared to the control subgroups with only VIS (median 598 versus 1398 ml ropivacaine, p< 0. 001, for <b>peridural</b> <b>catheter</b> analgesia; 31 versus 102 mg piritramide, p= 0. 001, for patient-controlled analgesia; 3. 4 versus 10. 2 g metamizole, p= 0. 005, for intravenous and oral analgesia). During irradiation with wIRA(+VIS) the subcutaneous oxygen partial pressure rose markedly by approximately 30 % and the subcutaneous temperature by approximately 2. 7 °C (both in a tissue depth of 2 cm), whereas both remained unchanged in the control group: after irradiation the median of the subcutaneous oxygen partial pressure was 41. 6 (with wIRA) versus 30. 2 mm Hg in the control group (p< 0. 001), the median of the subcutaneous temperature was 38. 9 versus 36. 4 °C (p< 0. 001). The overall evaluation of the effect of irradiation, including wound healing, pain and cosmesis, assessed on a VAS (0 - 100 with 50 as indifferent point of no effect) by the surgeon (median 79. 0 versus 46. 8, p< 0. 001) or the patient (79. 0 versus 50. 2, p< 0. 001) was markedly better in the group with wIRA compared to the control group. This was also true for single aspects: Wound healing assessed on a VAS by the surgeon (median 88. 6 versus 78. 5, p< 0. 001) or the patient (median 85. 8 versus 81. 0, p= 0. 040, trend) and cosmetic result assessed on a VAS by the surgeon (median 84. 5 versus 76. 5, p< 0. 001) or the patient (median 86. 7 versus 73. 6, p= 0. 001). In addition there was a trend in favor of the wIRA group to a lower rate of total wound infections (3 of 46, approximately 7 %, versus 7 of 48, approximately 15 %, p= 0. 208) including late infections after discharge, caused by the different rate of late infections after discharge: 0 of 46 in the wIRA group and 4 of 48 in the control group. And there was a trend towards a shorter postoperative hospital stay: 9 days in the wIRA group versus 11 days in the control group (p= 0. 037). The principal finding of this study was that postoperative irradiation with wIRA can improve even a normal wound healing process. A prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind study with 45 severely burned children at the Children’s Hospital Park Schönfeld, Kassel, Germany, showed with 30 minutes irradiation once a day (starting on the first day, day of burn as day 1) in the group with wIRA and visible light VIS (wIRA(+VIS), approximately 75 % wIRA, 25 % VIS) compared to a control group with only VIS a markedly faster reduction of wound size. On the fifth day (after 4 days with irradiation) decision was taken, whether surgical debridement of necrotic tissue was necessary because of deeper (second degree, type b) burns (11 of 21 in the group with wIRA, 14 of 24 in the control group) or non-surgical treatment was possible (second degree, type a, burns). The patients treated conservatively were kept within the study and irradiated till complete reepithelialization. The patients in the group with wIRA showed a markedly faster reduction of wound area: a median reduction of wound size of 50 % was reached already after 7 days compared to 9 days in the control group, a median reduction of wound size of 90 % was already achieved after 9 days compared to 13 days in the control group. In addition the group with wIRA showed superior results till 3 months after the burn in terms of the overall surgical assessment of the wound, cosmesis, and assessment of effects of irradiation compared to the control group. In a prospective, randomized, controlled study with 12 volunteers at the University Medical Center Charité, Berlin, Germany, within each volunteer 4 experimental superficial wounds (5 mm diameter) as an acute wound model were generated by suction cup technique, removing the roof of the blister with a scalpel and a sterile forceps (day 1). 4 different treatments were used and investigated during 10 days: no therapy, only wIRA(+VIS) (approximately 75 % wIRA, 25 % VIS; 30 minutes irradiation once a day), only dexpanthenol (= D-panthenol) cream once a day, wIRA(+VIS) and dexpanthenol cream once a day. Healing of the small experimental wounds was from a clinical point of view excellent with all 4 treatments. Therefore there were only small differences between the treatments with slight advantages of the combination wIRA(+VIS) and dexpanthenol cream and of dexpanthenol cream alone concerning relative change of wound size and assessment of feeling of the wound area. However laser scanning microscopy with a scoring system revealed differences between the 4 treatments concerning the formation of the stratum corneum (from first layer of corneocytes to full formation) especially on the days 5 - 7 : fastest formation of the stratum corneum was seen in wounds treated with wIRA(+VIS) and dexpanthenol cream, second was wIRA(+VIS) alone, third dexpanthenol cream alone and last were untreated wounds. Bacterial counts of the wounds (taken every 2 days) showed, that wIRA(+VIS) and the combination of wIRA(+VIS) with dexpanthenol cream were able to inhibit the colonisation with physiological skin flora up to day 5 when compared with the two other groups (untreated group and group with dexpanthenol cream alone). At any investigated time, the amount of colonisation under therapy with wIRA(+VIS) alone was lower (interpreted as more suppressed) compared with the group with wIRA(+VIS) and dexpanthenol cream. During rehabilitation after hip and knee endoprosthetic operations the resorption of wound seromas and wound hematomas was both clinically and sonographically faster and pain was reduced by irradiation with wIRA(+VIS). wIRA can be used successfully for persistent postoperative pain e. g. after thoracotomy. As perspectives for wIRA it seems clinically prudent to use wIRA both pre- and postoperatively, e. g. in abdominal and thoracic operations. wIRA can be used preoperatively (e. g. during 1 - 2 weeks) to precondition donor and recipient sites of skin flaps, transplants or partial-thickness skin grafts, and postoperatively to improve wound healing and to decrease pain, inflammation and infections at all mentioned sites. wIRA can be used to support routine pre- or intraoperative antibiotic administration or it might even be discussed to replace this under certain conditions by wIRA...|$|E
