60|$|The four <b>pushed</b> <b>side</b> by side; {{the outer}} wall bulged, split, and fell, and the villagers, dumb with horror, saw the savage, clay-streaked {{heads of the}} wreckers in the ragged gap. Then they fled, {{houseless}} and foodless, down the valley, as their village, shredded and tossed and trampled, melted behind them.|$|R

25|$|The {{purpose of}} door guards (also known as hinge guards, anti-finger {{trapping}} devices, or finger guards) {{is to reduce}} the number of finger trapping accidents in doors, as doors pose a risk to children especially when closing. Door guards protect fingers in door hinges by covering the gap that is created by opening doors by covering the hinges of doors with a piece of rubber or plastic that wraps from the door frame to the door. There are also door safety products which eject the fingers from the <b>push</b> <b>side</b> of the door as it is being closed.|$|R
25|$|Each player then stacks {{a row of}} 18 tiles, two tiles high {{in front}} of them (for a total of 36 tiles). Players then <b>push</b> each <b>side</b> of their stack {{together}} to form a square wall.|$|R
40|$|International {{migration}} {{in the last}} two decades has been increasingly gendered. Women have become important components of international migration flows both within Europe (from East to West) and from developing countries in Asia and Africa to Europe. Female migration has been encouraged by both push and pull factors. On the <b>push</b> <b>side,</b> the implosion of Communist regimes in central eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics has left women unemployed, without a welfare state to rely on and/or with salaries that were too low even for the mere survival of families. In developing countries, women were and still are faced with poverty and unemployment as well as violence...|$|R
50|$|The Newport {{class is}} the first amphibious ship to be fitted with an {{internal}} side propulsion unit located below the waterline near the bow. The bow thruster allows the bow to be <b>pushed</b> from <b>side</b> to side while the stern remains nearly stationary.|$|R
60|$|Leo {{was about}} to answer when Ben was <b>pushed</b> to one <b>side</b> and the portly form of Daniel Hawkins appeared.|$|R
50|$|A simple pump has a cupped fiber {{or plastic}} piston. On the forward stroke the air <b>pushes</b> the <b>sides</b> {{of the cup}} against the cylinder, so forming a seal; it {{provides}} its own valve. Then this piston can push {{the air out of}} the hole at the far end.|$|R

50|$|Paulinho {{has been}} {{described}} as a box-to-box midfielder, with powerful running and good movement into the box. He possesses the ability to <b>push</b> his <b>side</b> forward from midfield to supplement his strong defensive work. Paulinho also offers a useful presence in set piece situations at both ends of the pitch.|$|R

40|$|During polymer {{translocation}} {{driven by}} e. g. voltage drop across a nanopore, the segments in the cis-side is incessantly {{pulled into the}} pore, which are then pushed out of it into the trans-side. This pulling and pushing polymer segments are described in the continuum level by nonlinear transport processes known, respectively, as fast and slow diffusions. By matching solutions of both sides through the mass conservation across the pore, we provide a physical basis for the cis and trans dynamical asymmetry, a feature repeatedly reported in recent numerical simulations. We then predict how the total driving force is dynamically allocated between cis (pulling) and trans (<b>pushing)</b> <b>sides,</b> demonstrating that the trans-side event adds a finite-chain length effect to the dynamical scaling, which may become substantial for weak force and/or high pore friction cases.

50|$|McMahon is {{currently}} {{the captain of the}} Laois senior football team this year. He helped his Laois team to a memorable comeback in the Leinster quarter-finals in Croke Park on 13 June 2010. He got a superb goal that <b>pushed</b> his <b>side</b> to get a draw to force extra time and then a replay.|$|R
50|$|On 7 June 2017, West {{wrote his}} name into history by scoring the match winning try against the touring British and Irish Lions at Eden Park, with 6 minutes remaining. He added the {{conversion}} to <b>push</b> his <b>side</b> to a 22 - 16 final scoreline {{in what was}} the first Lions defeat on tour.|$|R

50|$|However, {{the edge}} reduces {{the size of}} the eddy current on each side, since it interferes with the {{circular}} current. Moving the plate sideways increases the current on one side, since the edge is interfering less, and this <b>pushes</b> that <b>side</b> higher. The plate is also pulled laterally back towards the centre by the currents, stabilising the lateral motion.|$|R

50|$|Finally Conrad <b>pushed</b> both <b>sides</b> to a compromise, {{that finally}} was found during another meeting in PÃ¶hlde: Hildesheim {{was given the}} {{jurisdiction}} over Gandersheim, conversely Mainz was vested with several surrounding estates. On 17 May 1030 the emperor celebrated Pentecost at Merseburg Cathedral, whereby he proclaimed {{the solution of the}} long-time quarrels. Later Aribo's successor Archbishop Bardo officially renounced any claims to Gandersheim Abbey. Therefter the conflict did not arise again.|$|R
50|$|Both <b>sides</b> <b>pushed</b> for {{a second}} in the final half-hour of the game but, despite {{increasingly}} frantic action, neither goalkeeper was troubled, and Guangzhou held on. The crowd of over 42,000 fans became deliriously happy.|$|R

25|$|The {{problems}} associated with foreign policy took on more importance in Argentina and revived {{the conflict between the}} three political factions, the one <b>pushing</b> for <b>siding</b> with the Allies, the neutrals, and the one more in tune with the Axis. This latter minority group included the followers of nationalism and some officers of the army. The subject of the position the country should take on the war displaced other issues in the national political arena.|$|R
50|$|After rails are untied {{from the}} sleepers, those old rails will be lifted up and <b>pushed</b> toward the <b>sides</b> of the train. The new rails are also fed in near {{the sides of}} the train in {{preparation}} to be inserted.|$|R
60|$|He {{then pointed}} to the boat, into which the men crowded in silence. There was no room to row; but oars were not needed, as a slight <b>push</b> against the <b>side</b> of the {{schooner}} sent the boat gliding to the shore.|$|R
50|$|The {{stripping}} pin is {{retained in}} the frame when <b>pushed</b> to the <b>side</b> to strip and is separate from the slide lock, as on the Megastar. The slide lock lever, magazine release and other features are reminiscent of the Megastar as well.|$|R
60|$|The eager {{rush and}} hurry {{of the people}} {{crowding}} the sidewalks impressed Rob {{with the idea that}} they were all behind time and were trying hard to catch up. He found it impossible to walk along comfortably without being elbowed and <b>pushed</b> from <b>side</b> to side; so a half hour's sight-seeing under such difficulties tired him greatly. It was a beautiful afternoon, and finding himself upon the Lake Front, Rob hunted up a vacant bench and sat down to rest.|$|R
50|$|Swim 500 yards (or 450 m) {{utilizing}} only combat {{side stroke}} or breast stroke within 12 minutes 30 seconds (candidates {{are allowed to}} <b>push</b> off the <b>sides</b> when turning. However, if the candidate uses the bottom to stand or rest, they will fail the test).|$|R
60|$|Under {{the shadow}} of this bust Hilary rested his {{forehead}} on his hand. In front of him were three open books {{and a pile of}} manuscript, and <b>pushed</b> to one <b>side</b> a little sheaf of pieces of green-white paper, press-cuttings of his latest book.|$|R
50|$|Nonetheless, he had {{to return}} to the second tier, though not with FC St. Pauli, as he {{returned}} south to his home city with TSV 1860 MÃ¼nchen in 1978. Once more, Gerber would fire a club to the Bundesliga as his 19-goal tally <b>pushed</b> the <b>side</b> to the championship. The following season would prove an uncharacteristically poor one for the striker as he lost form scoring just twice in his opening 10 games and being cast to the sidelines with the arrival of new coach Carl-Heinz RÃ¼hl.|$|R
60|$|Soon {{the trunk}} was {{unlocked}} and the lid thrown back. The box contained a miscellaneous collection of wearing apparel, which the captain <b>pushed</b> to one <b>side.</b> Then {{he brought out}} a cigar box containing some cheap jewelry and other odds and ends, {{as well as two}} five dollar bills.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} total force i. e. gas pressure, inertia force and initial spring force {{acting on the}} {{existing}} rocker arm is evaluated. It is found that the maximum stress is occurred at the <b>push</b> rod <b>side</b> end. For optimization the various models of rocker arm are developed, keeping its weight constant. The effect of total force on this various models are evaluated. The model showing less stress is found suitable as compared to other models. Geometric models are developed in software Pro-E and for analysis software ANSYS 11 is used...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{dynamics}} of ski skating, in particular, the optimization problem: Maximize average speed for a given power. We begin with a mathematical model of ski skating. To simplify the analysis, we limit our attention to ski skating with no poles on a level plane. We also limit {{our attention to the}} physics of ski skating; we ignore most biomechanical considerations. In the early days of skating, ski instructors often said: âTake a long glide on a flat ski. â Many skiers interpreted this to mean: âTake a passive glide, then give a short hard <b>push</b> to the <b>side.</b> â As an application of our theory, we show that this advice is wrong. We show that the skier should start <b>pushing</b> to the <b>side</b> as soon as possible...|$|R
