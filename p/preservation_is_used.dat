40|$|Germantown, Pennsylvania is a {{neighborhood}} {{located in the}} Northwest section of Philadelphia. Once Philadelphia’s original suburb, modern Germantown has undergone many changes, transforming in the 20 th Century from a streetcar suburb to a working class, predominately African American area. While the neighborhood demographics have certainly changed, Germantown possesses a distinctiveness which speaks to its historic roots; from Revolutionary War battles to Underground Railroad sites. This paper looks closely at three historic sites in Germantown to analyze their potential as tools for community and economic development; Cliveden, Awbury Arboretum, and the Johnson House. The principal focus {{of this research is}} how historical <b>preservation</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> in Germantown to promote community and economic development initiatives; whether that be the creation of new business and jobs, the development of community groups, or an increased emphasis on the aesthetics of Germantown Avenue. Ultimately, the analysis of the case studies provides a framework for a larger understanding of historic preservation and community development in Germantown; what the current conditions are and how they should be changed for the future in order to elevate the role of historic sites within the greater Germantown community...|$|E
40|$|Farmland {{preservation}} programs exist, in some form, in all states. Most programs pursue agricultural objectives, such as preserving productive {{soils and}} viable farms. However, {{in some states}} the public may believe that programs should pursue broader goals often associated with preserving open space. As farmland amenities have become relatively more scarce than food and fibre, public concern has shifted away from protecting agricultural production, toward preserving rural environmental quality. Choosing appropriate policies requires accurate information describing public preferences regarding farmland preservation. ^ Qualitative information provided by focus groups and survey data from a sample of Rhode Island residents, are used to identify and compare public objectives regarding farmland and open space preservation. A system of structural equations is used to examine preferences for farmland preservation goals among residents with different socioeconomic characteristics. Paired comparisons data from the survey are used in a dichotomous choice model to measure public preferences for preserving hypothetical farmland and open space parcels. An intertemporal conceptual model of farmland <b>preservation</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> to derive optimal farmland preservation paths. The analysis shows that Rhode Island residents believe environmental objectives should be important goals of farmland preservation programs. Public preferences for preserving farmland compare favorably with preferences for preserving other types of open space. Lands that protect endangered species and groundwater are preferred. Broadening the scope of farmland preservation programs to address environmental goals may increase the public benefits generated by those programs. ...|$|E

40|$|Issues {{arise when}} trying to {{understand}} the motivation of policymakers to preserve the assets of cultures that do not belong to the mainstream population. Tunbridge and Ashworth’s seminal study on ‘Dissonant Heritage’ and Bennett’s developmental model of intercultural sensitivity (DMIS model) provide a basis to evaluate both the motivations and the existence of a cultural dissonance. As there is a growing worldwide trend towards preserving and developing Jewish heritage tourism (JHT) this study examines Jewish heritage sites in three Macedonian cities endowed with rich Jewish history. Unlike previous studies concentrating on the notion of dissonant heritage this research focuses on the motivation for preserving such sites, an issue hardly tackled before. Previous studies suggested the prevalence of six possible motives: guilt, facing harsh history, emphasis on dark tourism, revival of a harmonious past, respect, and economic benefits. Data were obtained via face-to-face interviews conducted with policy-makers from central and local governments. The interviews were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively {{in order to determine the}} leading motives for preservation. The findings indicate that by establishing and maintaining Jewish heritage sites, stakeholders reflect sentiments of respect and admiration for the perished Jewish community and a longing for the revival of an elusive harmonious past. The potential economic benefits and dark tourism surfaced only as minor motives. Practically, JH <b>preservation</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> to revive dialogue with a forgotten past that may also contribute to urban tourism development in the future. Conceptually, the interviews did not reveal any indication of heritage dissonance, a finding that stands in sharp contrast to the dissonant heritage theory...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate long-term treatment outcomes of patients with tonsillar SCC, in order to aid in appropriate treatment selection. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective chart review of 105 patients with curatively treated tonsillar SCC between January 1996 and December 2005. Forty-three patients (41. 0 %) underwent primary surgery with or without adjuvant therapy (primary surgery group), and 62 patients (59. 0 %) were treated with radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy (RT/CRT, organ preservation group). Twenty patients (19 %) received tumor tonsillectomy before definitive RT/CRT and were grouped into the organ preservation group. ResultsNo significant differences were observed between the primary surgery and organ preservation groups in terms of local control (p =  0. 212), regional control (p =  0. 684), distant metastasis (p =  0. 627), 5 -year disease-specific survival (DSS, p =  0. 774), and overall survival rates (OS, p =  0. 667). The rates of major complication (p =  0. 216), long-term dependency on feeding tubes (p =  0. 876), and tracheostomy (p =  0. 401) were also similar. Advanced T classification (T 3 – 4) was the only factor associated with significantly worse DSS (p =  0. 007) and OS (p =  0. 012). However, there was also no difference in final treatment outcomes in T 3 – 4 patients regardless of whether they were treated with primary surgery or RT/CRT. In the organ preservation group, tumor tonsillectomy before RT/CRT did not improve local control (p =  0. 520) or other treatment outcomes, including 5 -year DSS (p =  0. 707) and OS (p =  0. 745). ConclusionBoth primary surgery and RT/CRT organ preservation are effective treatments for tonsillar SCC. Single modality treatment, either surgery or RT/CRT, can typically be provided for stage I–II diseases. Although RT/CRT organ <b>preservation</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> more frequently for stage III–IV tonsillar SCC in recent years, primary surgery combined with adjuvant therapy still achieves equivalent outcomes.

40|$|Meridional {{transports}} of mass, heat, nutrients, {{and carbon}} across coast-to-coast WOCE and pre-WOCE sections between 11 °S and 45 °S in the South Atlantic are calculated using an inverse model. Usually salt <b>preservation</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> {{as a condition}} in the inverse model, and only {{in the case of}} heat transport the condition of zero total mass transport is taken instead. Other constraints include silica conservation, prescribed southward fluxes of salt and phosphate, and transports in the southward Brazil Current and in the northward Antarctic Bottom Water flow obtained from WOCE moored current meter arrays. The constraints set the underdetermined system of linear equations of the inverse model whose solutions depend on weights, scales, and matrix ranks. The discussion emphasizes the sensitivity of the fluxes to changes in the model input. The transports given in the following are obtained as the means of “reasonable” solutions at 30 °S. The error numbers in parentheses include uncertainties due to wind stress and temporal variability, the numbers without parentheses do not contain these terms: 0. 53 ± 0. 03 (0. 09) Tg s− 1 mass to the south, 0. 29 ± 0. 05 (0. 24) PW heat to the north, 15 ± 120 (500) kmol s− 1 oxygen to the south, 121 ± 22 (75) kmol s− 1 nitrate to the south, 64 ± 110 (300) silica to the north, and 1997 ± 215 (600) kmol s− 1 dissolved inorganic carbon to the south. The above errors in transports are obviously dominated by uncertainties in wind stress and temporal variability. The divergence in meridional heat and mass transport is consistent with integral surface flux changes between corresponding zonal bands. The mass compensation of southward flowing North Atlantic Deep Water occurs to a greater extent in the warm surface waters than in the Antarctic Intermediate Water below. If one follows the arguments of earlier authors on the relation between meridional fluxes and the significance of the two possible pathways for the global thermohaline circulation, the warm water path south of Africa seems to be somewhat more important than the cold water path through Drake Passage...|$|E

Monotonicity <b>preservation</b> <b>is</b> applied only where the scalar field {{is likely to}} contain discontinuities as indicated by significant grid-cell-to-grid-cell variations in a smoothness measure conceptually {{similar to that used}} in weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) methods. In smooth regions, the numerical diffusion associated with monotonicity-preserving methods is avoided. The resulting method, while not globally monotonicity preserving, allows the full accuracy of the underlying advection scheme to be achieved in smooth regions. The violations of monotonicity that do occur are generally very small, as seen in the tests presented here. Strict positivity <b>preservation</b> may <b>be</b> effectively and efficiently obtained through an additional flux correction step. The underlying advection scheme used to test this methodology is a variant of the piecewise parabolic method (PPM) that may be applied to multi-dimensional problems using density-corrected dimensional splitting and permits stable semi-Lagrangian integrations using CFL numbers larger than one.
