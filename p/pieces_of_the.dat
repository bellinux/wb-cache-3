The pieces are set out as shown in the diagram and photo, with each queen on a square of its own color, the white queen on a light square and the black queen on a dark.|$|E

5|$|On 9 October, Banksy {{unveiled}} one of {{the more}} elaborate and politically strong <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series. It featured armed soldiers and horses spray-painted on a car and trailer in an empty lot in the Lower East Side. Instead of commentary about the work, the accompanying audio was that of a classified video from the July 12, 2007 Baghdad airstrike. After being dismantled, the car was towed away to prevent further defacement.|$|E

5|$|The Mint struck pattern <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smaller size, {{with various}} shapes and compositions. An 11-sided coin was considered, {{which would have}} {{differentiated}} it from the quarter, but the patterns would not work in vending machines. Such exotic metals as titanium were considered before the Mint decided on the standard clad composition. Gasparro prepared, for the circulating pieces, a design showing Liberty with flowing hair, similar to early American coins.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{reports from}} the crash site speculated that the Amana was already on fire when it struck the tops of trees because those trees, and <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft's left wing torn off in the impact with them, showed signs of scorching. Several eyewitnesses reported seeing flames in the sky before the aircraft struck the ground. Department of Civil Aviation investigators discounted this speculation because {{only one of the}} Amana's push-button engine fire extinguishers had activated and this had most likely occurred during the crash or the fire.|$|E
5|$|The episode's soundtrack was {{composed}} by Jennie Muskett, who also composed for the series. When reviewing the scenes {{leading to the}} conclusion she felt sympathetic towards the suicide bomber, and wanted to portray the background music through the bomber's point of view.

In addition, regular <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soundtrack were reused {{throughout much of the}} episode. Muskett saw the episode as among the most rewarding she worked on.|$|E
