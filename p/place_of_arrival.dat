This famous old French trading post continued to be a rallying point for a multifarious and motley population. The inhabitants were amphibious in their habits, most of them being, or having been voyageurs or canoe men. It was the great <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> and departure of the southwest fur trade. Here the Mackinaw Company had established its principal post, from whence it communicated with the interior and with Montreal. Hence its various traders and trappers set out for their respective destinations about Lake Superior and its tributary waters, or for the Mississippi, the Arkansas, the Missouri, and the other regions of the west. Here, after the absence of a year, or more, they returned with their peltries, and settled their accounts; the furs rendered in by them being transmitted in canoes from hence to Montreal. Mackinaw was, therefore, for a great part of the year, very scantily peopled; but at certain seasons the traders arrived from all points, with their crews of voyageurs, and the place swarmed like a hive.|$|E

Though important <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> and departure, movement and transition, parking garage design is typically the result of a depressingly pragmatic adherence to functional efficiency. A critique of this status quo, this thesis proposes treating parking as a catalyst for innovative suburban development. By leveraging the scale of parking garages, their role as <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> and departure, and striving to integrate rather than separate parking from its context, this thesis seeks to create a new suburban typology...|$|R

40|$|M. Arch (Prof) The {{ideology}} of hospitality, symbolic of travel {{in a world}} filled with experiences is sought by us all. The notion of exploration {{as a result of}} our curiosity is deeply embedded in our makeup. A profound understanding of the world is one of our greatest endeavours as it is routed in the conception of cognitive thought. We are wired to settle in the most habitable parts of the planet and even then we feel the urge for discovery, we do this in the form of travel. From my own encounters as a young boy, nothing expresses this narrative better than the exhilaration and excitement I felt then I arrived in a new city. My experiences by their very nature were formulated from a multitude of sensory indulgences which were unfamiliar but most intriguing. Drawing comparison came naturally as the mind’s way of evaluating the surroundings and juxtaposing them with those of my home. This analogy was the core principle to interpreting foreign spaces and devising conclusive outlooks. During the time that one absorbs any foreign way of life, the hotel takes care of the traveler's basic needs and contributes significantly to the overall experience, lending to the enjoyment and relaxation of travel both of which are key components. The city itself encapsulates the principals of hospitality as it fundamentally offers the traveler, visitor and the local inhabitant, sustenance, safety, and shelter, essentials that are expected and in place from our early social development. These elements are the most basic necessities to sustain survival and are readily available in any city. In the past, cities were fortified against aggressors by defensive walls which enclosed the city and which apart from their utilitarian function, symbolized the status and sovereignty of the citizens and the grandeur of the city. The entrance to the city was through a befitting imposing gate which demarcated the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> and entry and added to the city's standing. With the progression of time and the advent of rail travel, the city's railway station defined a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> and was often among the grandest structures, designed to impress and declaring lavish opulence and wealth. This thesis investigates the possibilities of creating a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> in Johannesburg both symbolically and factually. Our metropolis, known as the provincial capital of the Gauteng Province, has, due to its rapid expansion in its relatively short life, no recognizable <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival.</b> The introduction of the Gautrain Station in the immediate vicinity of Park Station presented an opportunity to link the station to a hotel and creating a pedestrian throughway from the station that passes through the hotel and into the city. The passage way traverses an impressive square with features designed to create an ennobling introduction to the city. The design realizes all the criteria of arrival into the city. It combines the railway station which is the mode of travel, the squares form the introduction to the city, the symbolic entrance is the opening through the hotel building, the hotel structure acts as the city wall and the hotel is the traveler's destination offering all the comforts and sustenance. All this serves to create the right ambiance to encourage tourists to remain in the city rather than proceed elsewhere in the area. Johannesburg is unique and is irreplaceable, it has suffered abandonment and neglect but was once much loved and cherished, it is part of our identity, ours to regain and treasure and deserves a noteworthy <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival...</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The authors tested {{whether a}} simple model {{based on the}} {{cancellation}} of {{the rate of change}} in bearing angle could account for the behavioral adaptations produced when individuals intercept moving balls while walking. In Experiment 1, the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> of the ball and the angle of approach were varied. In accord with the model, velocity regulations were earlier and more pronounced the larger the angle of approach. In Experiment 2, ball speed unexpectedly changed during a trial, once again highlight-ing participants ’ functional velocity adaptations. A direct test of the model on the basis of each individual trial (N = 256) revealed that, on average, 70 % of the total variance could be explained. Together, those results confirm the usefulness of such a robust strategy in the control of interceptive tasks.

This stochastic fluid network with deterministic cdf's governing processing at the queues arises as the limit of normalized networks of infinite-server queues with batch arrival processes where the batch sizes grow.
