40|$|Growing {{interest}} {{in the market for}} humic substances with agricultural applications has {{led to the development of}} new potential sources of these compounds other than fossil matrices (e. g. different kinds of lignite), which, until now, have represented the main raw material for the extraction of humus-like products. High quality compost (green compost) obtained through the aerobic biostabilization of selected organic residues, such as vegetable waste from source-collection at garden-produce markets, may be considered for this purpose. Beyond the primary need to develop technically and economically reliable procedures for the extraction of humic substances from compost at the industrial scale, importance must be placed on controlling the influence of such compounds on soil-plant systems. Humates from leonardite, representative of the active agents among humus-based commercial preparations, have been compared in pot trials with humic acids, potassium salts, from green compost in order to evaluate their respective effects on soil microbial activity and plant productivity. Differences between <b>pot</b> <b>blocks</b> amended with humic acids have suggested that humus-like substances extracted from compost seem to exert higher stimulative effects on microbial growth and vegetative biomass production than fossil humates...|$|R

40|$|Loss of the RecQ DNA helicase WRN protein causes Werner syndrome, {{in which}} {{patients}} exhibit features of premature aging and increased cancer. WRN deficiency induces cellular defects in DNA replication, mitotic homologous recombination (HR), and telomere stability. In addition to DNA unwinding activity, WRN also possesses exonuclease, strand annealing, and branch migration activities. The single strand binding proteins replication protein A (RPA) and telomere-specific POT 1 specifically stimulate WRN DNA unwinding activity. To determine whether RPA and POT 1 also modulate WRN branch migration activity, we examined biologically relevant mobile D-loops that mimic structures in HR strand invasion and at telomere ends.

40|$|International audienceTo {{gain insight}} into the dry season {{survival}} strategies of Anopheles gambiae s. l., a new contained semi-field system was developed and used {{for the first time}} in Burkina Faso, West Africa. The system consisted of a screened greenhouse within which the local environment was reproduced, including all ecological requirements for mosquito development cycle completion. The system was seeded with the progenies of female Anopheles gambiae, Anopheles coluzzii, and Anopheles arabiensis collected in the vicinity of the greenhouse during the rainy season. After successful establishment in the semi-field system, mosquito populations were monitored over a 1 -yr period by regular surveys of larval and adult specimens. We provided evidence for the persistence of adult mosquitoes throughout the dry season, in the absence of any suitable larval development site. During the hot and dry periods, adult insects were observed in artificial shelters (clay <b>pots,</b> building <b>blocks,</b> and dark corners). The mosquito population rapidly built up with the return of the rainy season in the area, when artificial breeding sites were refilled in the enclosure. However, only An. coluzzii and, later, An. arabiensis were detected in the subsequent rainy season, whereas no An. gambiae specimen was found. Our findings suggest that An. coluzzii and An. arabiensis may be able to aestivate throughout the dry season in Southwestern Burkina Faso, whereas An. gambiae might adopt a different dry-season survival strategy, such as long-distance re-colonization from distant locations. These results may have important implications for malaria control through targeted vector control interventions...|$|R

The sediment only (BS), soil only (S) and soil-sediment composite (S+BS) were each amended with poultry manure (PM), cow dung (CD) and biochar (BC), then maize (Obatanpa variety) grown for 45 days. Plant height, leaf length, girth and width were measured weekly. The dredged sediment from the Odaw River was found to be good and quite similar to the soil from the cultivated field in terms of organic matter, organic carbon and macro nutrients.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryBarry J. BradfordDeclining {{ground water}} {{supplies}} are putting significant {{pressure on the}} dairy industry in the United States. The water needed for forage production represents {{the great majority of}} total water use on most dairy farms, posing a major challenge in the pursuit of improved drought resilience. Teff (Eragrostis tef), a drought-tolerant annual grass (C 4 physiology) native to Ethiopia, could prove an attractive alternative to traditional forage crops. While teff grass has potential to fit the needs for forage production in water-stressed regions, very little is currently known about its nutritional characteristics and whether it can support high levels of milk production by dairy cattle. An experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of variety and cutting age on dry matter yield, nutritive values, and digestibility of teff grass. Eighty <b>pots</b> were <b>blocked</b> by location in a greenhouse and randomly assigned to 4 teff varieties (Tiffany, Moxie, Corvallis, and Dessie) and to 5 cutting ages (40, 45, 50, 55, or 60 d after planting [DAP]). Results from this study indicate that, under greenhouse conditions, the first cutting of teff grass should be harvested at 45 to 50 DAP to optimize forage yield, quality, and digestibility in that cutting and in subsequent cuttings. A second experiment was conducted to assess the productivity of lactating dairy cows fed diets with teff hay as the sole forage. Nine multiparous Holstein cows were randomly assigned treatment sequence in a 3 × 3 Latin square design. Diets were either a control, where dietary forage consisted of a combination of corn silage, alfalfa hay, and prairie hay, or 1 of 2 teff diets, where teff hay was the sole forage. The teff diets maintained yields of milk and milk fat while increasing milk protein yield. Together, these two studies suggest that teff-based diets have potential to maintain high levels of milk production while improving the resilience of the dairy industry to future water shortages...|$|R

40|$|The {{extreme value}} theory for {{applications}} {{in such a}} responsible branch of industry as offshore and maritime engineering requires a robust, straightforward and reliable method for estimating the statistics of extremes. A method {{must be able to}} extract as much statistical information as possible from a recorded time series of data. In addition, a method must be capable to utilize the information regarding the temporal dependence structure of the process, as well as spatial dependence characteristics of the given time series in the bivariate case. In this thesis, a newly developed method for the purpose of predicting extremes associated with the observed process is studied thoroughly and improved. The method {{is referred to as the}} average conditional exceedance rate (ACER) method. It avoids the problem of having to decluster the data to ensure independence, which is a requisite component in the application of, for example, the standard peaks-over-threshold (POT) method. Moreover, the ACER method is specifically designed to account for statistical dependence between the sampled data points in a precise manner. The proposed method also targets the use of sub-asymptotic data to improve prediction accuracy. The research shows that the ACER method, if properly implemented, is able to provide a statistical representation with error bounds of the exact extreme value distribution given by the data. In the first part of the thesis, the method is demonstrated in detail by application to both synthetic and real environmental data. From a practical point of view, it appears to perform better than the <b>POT</b> and <b>block</b> maxima methods, and, with an appropriate modification, it is directly applicable to non-stationary time series. In the second part of the thesis, the ACER method for estimation of extreme value statistics is extended in a natural way to also cover the case of bivariate time series. This is achieved by introducing a cascade of conditioning approximations to the exact bivariate extreme value distribution. The results show that when the cascade converges, an accurate empirical estimate of the extreme value distribution can be obtained. It is also revealed that the possible functional representation of the empirically estimated bivariate ACER surface can be derived from the properties of the extreme-value copula. In this thesis, application of the bivariate ACER method is substantially studied for bivariate synthetic data. Finally, performance of the method is demonstrated for measured coupled wind speed and wave height data as well as simultaneous wind speed measurements from two separate locations...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} herein {{focuses on}} the assembly of polyoxotungstates (POTs) from nanosized clusters to dimensional frameworks with transition metal (AgI, CuII, CoII and MnII) linkers. It shows two ways of producing such POTs: one is ‘stepwise’ synthesis, where <b>POT</b> building <b>blocks</b> are first produced and then coordinate with other addenda metal ions or links to form multiple POTs. The other method is the frequently used ‘one-pot’ method, where all chemical reagents are added together in a ‘one-pot’ aqueous solution, then acidified. With the ‘stepwise’ method, an all-inorganic polyoxometalate open-framework (POMOF) 1 was obtained based on the P 8 W 48 building block with intrinsic porosity and Co cations. This compound displays unprecedented structural flexibility. Not only does this material undergo the largest single-crystal to single crystal transformation thus far reported, the framework itself can be ‘reprogrammed’ (1 - 3) using the addition and removal of small molecule guests (water, ammonia and methanol). All these occur through multiple single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformations, allowing snapshots of the mechanism of solid-state conversion to be obtained. By changing the transition metal to Ag, three totally different three dimensional (3 D) frameworks were formed with different reagents ratios and reaction temperatures. 4 is the uninodal 8 -connected network, while 5 is a complex network with special building blocks P 10 W 68, consisting of one P 8 W 48 ring with a P 2 W 15 cap attached. 6 is a cubic nano-sized porous framework assembled from cubic Ag 3 -P 8 W 486 units, which has two different cavities in the structure: one is the cubic cavity with a diameter of 2. 4 nm {{and the other is}} the one dimensional (1 D) cavity, with a diameter of 1 nm. With the ‘one-pot’ method, a time dependent supramolecular assembly of three giant POTs containing a Ag 12 -in-W 76 cluster-in-cluster was discovered. This work gives the structural hierarchy as Cl-  Ag 12 Cl  Ag 12 ClTe 3 W 76 (monomer) 7  [Ag 12 ClTe 3 W 76] 2 (dimer) 8  [Ag 12 ClTe 3 W 76]n (3 D) 9. Each of these compounds was isolated in turn by employing a time resolved crystallisation process, allowing an unprecedented degree of kinetic control for this reaction system. The proposed mechanism for the formation of the clusters has been studied with Electrospray Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS) to identify the key Te 3 W 38 building block. Further, control experiments (forming 10 and 11) demonstrate the crucial role that TeO 32 -, Cl-, and Ag+ play in the self-assembly of 7 - 9. In order to further prove the crucial role of hetero-templates and Ag+ cations in forming this kind of high nuclearity POTs, with the hetero-template SeO 32 - instead of TeO 32 -, three other similar clusters, 12 - 14, were produced. Without the heteroatom, four POTs formed with the lacunary W 11 and W 12 building blocks linked by copper cations at higher pH value, especially, a tetrameric POT 15, which contains a hexadecacopper(II) core consisting of four cubane-like [Cu 4 O 4] units was successfully prepared. While, 16 is a 1 D polyanion chain constructed by lacunary W 11 clusters with copper dimer linkers. The electrochemical behavior of 15 and 16 is fairly similar, which shows the gradual reduced processes of the CuII/CuI and the CuI/Cu 0. Utilising the same strategy, another two novel compounds 17 and 18 have been synthesized by changing the ratio of Cu(OAc) 2 /Na 2 WO 4, the reaction time and the pH value. 17 is the first polyanionic transition metal POM chain known to date. 18 is a porous two dimensional (2 D) network which is built from ‘paddle-wheel’ shaped copper dimers and Keggin type POMs, W 12 O 40. Furthermore, a new family of isopolyoxotungstates (isoPOTs) possessing the newly discovered W 21 O 72 building block was obtained. This unit comprises an open W 19 shell supported internally by two WO 6 octahedral templates. The open shell has growth sites which facilitate the aggregation of the W 21 O 72 units into the larger architectures of 19 - 22. 19 represents the first example of a molecular metal oxide cluster containing a chiral ‘double-stranded’ motif, whilst 21 {{is one of the largest}} transition metal substituted isoPOTs known and is helical in nature. The four clusters described here each contain pentagonal W(W 5) motifs and related WO 7 containing species, W(W 3) and W(W 4), observed for the first time in isoPOTs, serving as an important milestone towards the discovery of gigantic POTs compared to those frequently observed in polyoxomolybdates (POMos) ...|$|R
