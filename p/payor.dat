5|$|The legal {{elements}} and {{features of the}} major federal public corruption offenses differ. The various jurisdictional elements of the offenses require that the prosecution prove, alternatively: that the payee was a federal official; that the payee organization received $10,000 in federal funds; that the corrupt communications involved {{the use of the}} mail or interstate wires; that the corruption affected interstate commerce or interstate travel. The mens rea elements differ in whether they require a quid pro quo; a mere nexus is an easier element to prove; more difficult elements to prove include the intent to be influenced and inducement. The offenses also differ in whether the act to be procured from the public official must be an official, a violation of an official duty, a fraud on the United States, or an official transaction. The offenses also differ in whether the <b>payor</b> may be prosecuted in addition to the public official. Finally, the offenses differ in whether they are predicates for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and money laundering prosecutions, and in the maximum authorized prison sentence that may be imposed upon conviction.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{charge and}} payment differentials for home health services across different <b>payors.</b> DATA SOURCES: The 1992 National Home and Hospice Care Survey, a nationally representative survey {{of home and}} hospice care agencies and their patients, collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. STUDY DESIGN: We compare the average charge for a Medicare home health visit to the average charge for patients with other sources of payment. In making such comparisons, we control for differences across <b>payors</b> in service mix and agency characteristics. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Agencies charge various <b>payors</b> different amounts for similar services, and Medicare is consistently charged more than other <b>payors.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Findings imply the potential existence of payment differentials across <b>payors</b> for home health services, with Medicare and privately insured patients likely to be paying more than others for similar services. Such conclusions raise the possibility that, as in other segments of the healthcare market, cost-shifting and price discrimination might exist within the home health industry. Future research should explore these issues, along {{with the question of}} whether Medicare is paying too much for home health services...|$|R

25|$|At common law, {{and under}} some earlier tax statutes, {{the filing of}} a protest {{at the time of}} payment of an {{erroneous}} tax was a requirement in order for the <b>payor</b> to recover a refund of the tax at a later time. In the case of U.S. federal taxes, the rule was abolished by Congress in 1924. Under the current Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the taxpayer's failure to protest does not deprive the taxpayer of the right to file an administrative claim with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for a refund and, if the claim is not allowed by the IRS, to sue for a tax refund in Federal district court.|$|E

500|$|Having {{established}} this expansive objective as {{the starting}} point, Yong C.J. dismissed {{the notion that the}} over- and under-inclusiveness of section 37(1) meant it was unconstitutional. In considering over-inclusiveness, he considered the argument that the [...] "net cast by the legislature" [...] would include a person whom the provision was not intended to catch, such as a Singapore citizen who is a foreign permanent resident, employed in the foreign country by the foreign government, receiving a bribe paid in foreign currency by a foreign <b>payor.</b> He held, however, that such alleged over-inclusiveness was irrelevant to the constitutional issue of equality, as it would apply to all citizens as a class. In addressing under-inclusiveness, he cited the need to respect international comity, thereby rendering impractical the extension of section 37(1) to govern non-citizens living abroad. The differences in the High Court and the Court of Appeal's approaches are summed up in the following table: ...|$|E
500|$|Referring to the {{parliamentary}} material {{relating to the}} original Act and the subsequent addition of section 37(1), the Court found that section 37(1) was added to [...] "address acts of corruption taking place outside Singapore but affecting events within it". To this end, it held that classification {{along the lines of}} citizenship was an unreasonable means of attaining the objective of section 37(1) of PCA, for it was both over-inclusive and under-inclusive. Legislation is over-inclusive if it catches a class of persons not originally contemplated as falling within the objective of the Act, and under-inclusive if it catches a class of persons who clearly do not fall within the mischief sought to be addressed by the Act. On the facts, section 37(1) was over-inclusive as a Singapore citizen who was now a permanent resident of a foreign country and employed there who received a bribe in a foreign currency from a foreign <b>payor</b> would be guilty of an offence under the Act. Conversely, it was simultaneously under-inclusive since a Singapore permanent resident or a foreigner working for the Government of Singapore who takes a trip outside Singapore to receive a bribe in Singapore dollars in relation to an act he will do in Singapore is not caught under the Act.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Alito also {{rejected}} Ocasio's {{argument that}} the Court's [...] "interpretation makes the Hobbs Act sweep too broadly, creating a national antibribery law and displacing a carefully crafted network {{of state and federal}} statutes". In Evans v. United States, the Court had explained that an act of extortion under the Hobbs act was the [...] "rough equivalent" [...] of bribery. Because Ocasio did not ask the court to overrule Evans and because the Court had [...] "no occasion to do so" [...] sua sponte, Justice Alito held that [...] "we have no principled basis for precluding the prosecution of conspiracies to commit" [...] extortion under the Hobbs act. Justice Alito also rejected the {{argument that the}} Court's ruling would [...] "transform every bribe of a public official into a conspiracy to commit extortion" [...] because [...] "n cases where the bribe <b>payor</b> is merely complying with an official demand, the <b>payor</b> lacks the mens rea necessary for a conspiracy". Consequently, because Ocasio entered into an agreement to extort money [...] "under color of official right", the Court affirmed Ocasio's conviction.|$|E

2500|$|Because of the tax-free {{nature of}} death benefits, the IRC prohibits the {{deduction}} of the premiums paid for life insurance when the premium <b>payor</b> {{is also the}} beneficiary of the death benefit rather than the individual employee and their family. In addition, loans from insurers secured by policy values are not income and earnings credited to an owner's policy values (known as [...] "inside buildup") by the insurance company are not currently taxed (and may escape taxation altogether if such earnings are not distributed other than {{as part of the}} death benefits paid upon the death of the insured).|$|E
2500|$|Under U.S. tax law, U.S. persons (regardless {{of country}} of residence) are {{generally}} {{required to report}} and pay U.S. federal income tax on income from all sources. The U.S. is unique in taxing not only non-resident citizens but also non-resident [...] "U.S. Persons for tax purposes". The law requires U.S. citizens living abroad to pay U.S. taxes on foreign income if the foreign tax should be less than U.S. tax ("taxing up"), independently within each category of earned income and passive income. For this reason, the increased reporting requirements of FATCA have had extensive implications for U.S. citizens living abroad. Taxpayer identification numbers and source withholding are also now used to enforce asset reporting requirements upon non-resident U.S. citizens. For example, mandatory withholding can be required via FATCA when a U.S. <b>payor</b> cannot confirm the non-U.S. status of a foreign payee.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a {{dissenting opinion}} {{in which he}} argued that Ocasio's {{conviction}} should be reversed because [...] "an extortionist cannot conspire to commit extortion with the person whom he is extorting". He stated that the majority opinion [...] "further exposes the flaw in this Court’s understanding of extortion". Justice Thomas argued that this misunderstanding originated in the Court's prior opinion in Evans v. United States, which, according to Justice Thomas, [...] "wrongly equated extortion with bribery". In Evans, Justice Thomas wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that under the Hobbs Act, [...] "the only perpetrator is the public official; the <b>payor</b> is a victim and not a participant". Relying upon this principle, Justice Thomas reiterated {{that it is not}} possible for an extortionist and [...] "his payor-victim can be co-conspirators to extortion of the payor". Justice Thomas criticized the majority for taking [...] "another step away from the common-law understanding of extortion that the Hobbs Act adopted", and argued that [...] "nly by blurring the distinction between bribery and extortion could Evans make it seem plausible that an extortionist and a victim can conspire to extort the victim".|$|E
