50|$|<b>Perry</b> <b>pear</b> trees {{can live}} {{to a great}} age, and can be fully {{productive}} for 250 years. They also grow to a considerable height and can have very large canopies; the largest recorded, a tree at Holme Lacy which still partly survives, covered three quarters of an acre and yielded a crop of 5-7 tons in 1790. Their size often led to them being planted to provide a windbreak for apple orchards.|$|E
5000|$|However, perry (often marketed {{under the}} name [...] "pear cider", below) has in very recent times {{increased}} in popularity, with around 2.5 million British consumers purchasing it in one year. In addition, various organisations have been actively seeking out old <b>perry</b> <b>pear</b> trees and orchards and rediscovering lost varieties, many of which now exist only as single trees on isolated farms; for example, the Welsh Cider Society recently rediscovered the old Monmouthshire varieties [...] "Burgundy" [...] and the [...] "Potato Pear" [...] {{as well as a}} number of further types unrecorded up to that point.|$|E
50|$|As with cider apples, special pear cultivars {{are used}} to make <b>Perry.</b> <b>Perry</b> <b>pears</b> {{are thought to be}} descended from wild hybrids, known as wildings, between the {{cultivated}} pear Pyrus communis subsp. communis, brought to northern Europe by the Romans, and the now-rare wild pear Pyrus communis subsp. pyraster. <b>Perry</b> <b>pears</b> are higher in tannin and acid than eating or cooking pears, and are generally smaller.|$|R
5000|$|CAMRA takes makers like Brothers to task, {{defining}} <b>perry</b> and <b>pear</b> cider {{as quite}} different drinks, stating that [...] "pear cider" [...] as {{made by the}} large industrial cidermakers is merely a pear-flavoured drink, or more specifically a cider-style drink flavoured with pear concentrate, whereas [...] "perry" [...] should be made by traditional methods from <b>perry</b> <b>pears</b> only. (Brothers, Bulmers and other pear ciders are made from pear concentrate, often imported.) Others, including the industry trade National Association of Cider Makers, maintain that the terms <b>perry</b> and <b>pear</b> cider are interchangeable. Its own rules specify that <b>perry</b> or <b>pear</b> cider may contain no more than 25% apple juice.|$|R
50|$|Southwest of the {{municipality}} is located {{parallel to the}} country road L1214 a <b>perry</b> <b>pears</b> trail. The 500 m long path {{was built in the}} years 1998 to 2003, and shows various most pear varieties.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of <b>perry</b> <b>pear</b> varieties in the UK originate from {{the counties of}} Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire in the west of England. Of these, most originate in parishes around May Hill on the Gloucestershire/Herefordshire border. The standard reference work on these varieties of pear was published in 1963 by the Long Ashton Research Station; since then many varieties have become critically endangered or lost. There were over 100 varieties, known by over 200 local names, in Gloucestershire alone. Perry pears were particularly known for their picturesque names, such as the various Huffcap varieties (Hendre Huffcap, Red Huffcap, Black Huffcap, all having an elliptical shape), those named {{for the effects of}} their product (Merrylegs, Mumblehead), pears commemorating an individual (Stinking Bishop, named for the man who first grew it, or Judge Amphlett, named for Assizes court judge Richard Amphlett), or those named for the place they grew (Hartpury Green, Bosbury Scarlet, Bartestree Squash). In the UK the most commonly used variety is the Blakeney Red. Unsuitable for eating, it produces superior perry.|$|E
40|$|<b>Perry</b> <b>pear</b> {{polyphenols}} {{were characterized}} in fruit, juice and pomace for two cultivars and at two maturity stage. Cell walls were characterized only in fruits and pomaces. The phenolic contents and compositions of fruits {{did not change}} during overripening. However, their extraction to juice was modified. Juices of ripe fruits contained 38 % (Plant de Blanc) and 28 % (De Cloche) of initial polyphenols, whereas overripe pear juices contained only 26 % and 15 % respectively. Thus, procyanidins had more affinity for cell walls after overripening. Pear cell walls from De Cloche cultivar lost arabinose and galactose from pectic side chains during overripening promoting non-covalent interactions between procyanidins and cell walls...|$|E

50|$|Both English perry making, and the {{orchards}} that supplied it, {{suffered a}} catastrophic {{decline in the}} second half of the 20th century as a result of changing tastes and agricultural practices (in South Gloucestershire alone, an estimated 90% of orchards were lost in the last 75 years). Many pear orchards were also lost to Fire blight in the 1970s and 1980s. As well as the clearing of orchards, the decline of day labouring on farms meant that the manpower to harvest <b>perry</b> <b>pears</b> - as well as its traditional consumers - disappeared. It also lost popularity due to makers turning to dessert or general purpose pears in its manufacture rather than <b>perry</b> <b>pears,</b> resulting in a thin and tasteless product. In the UK prior to 2007, the small amounts of traditional perry still produced were mainly consumed by people living in farming communities.|$|R

40|$|The {{flesh and}} peel of 19 pear cultivars (8 Tunisian dessert cultivars, 8 European dessert cultivars and 3 French <b>perry</b> <b>pear</b> cultivars) were studied for their {{phenolic}} composition. Phenolic compounds {{were identified by}} HPLC/ESI-MS 2 and individually quantified by HPLC-DAD. Five classes of polyphenols were present: flavan- 3 -ols, phenolic acids, flavonols, anthocyanins and simple phenolics (hydroquinones). The total phenolic content ranged between 0. 1 g/kg Fresh Weight (FW) ('Conference' cultivar) and 8. 6 g/kg FW ('Plant De Blanc' cultivar) in the flesh and between 1. 6 g/kg FW ('William vert' cultivar) and 40. 4 g/kg FW ('Arbi Chiheb' cultivar) in the peel. Procyanidins, analyzed after thioacidolysis, were the main phenolic compounds in all pear cultivars either in the pulp or the peel, their constitutive units being essentially (-) -epicatechin. Tunisian dessert pears and French perry pears are richer in procyanidins with very high degree of polymerization (> 100) for Tunisian pears. Peel procyanidins were less polymerized (from 4 to 20). Pear peel phenolic profile was more complex especially for Tunisian cultivars, with flavonols and in some cultivars anthocyanins...|$|E
50|$|<b>Perry</b> <b>pears</b> {{often have}} {{higher levels of}} sugar than cider apples, {{including}} unfermentable sugars such as sorbitol, which can give the finished drink a residual sweetness. They also have a very different tannin content to cider apples, with a predominance of astringent over bitter flavours. The presence of sorbitol can also give perry a mild laxative effect.|$|R
5000|$|... "Pear cider" [...] has {{in recent}} years been used as an {{alternative}} name for alcoholic drinks containing pear juice, in preference to the term perry [...] According to the BBC, the term was first used when Brothers Cider, a product industrially made from pear concentrate, rather than the traditional method using <b>perry</b> <b>pears,</b> was sold at Glastonbury Festival in 1995: nobody understood what perry was and were told that it was [...] "like cider, but made from pears".|$|R
5000|$|The {{beverage}} is {{also becoming}} increasingly popular in Australia. Small local manufacturers {{are beginning to}} appear such as Gypsy Cider, brewed by 2 Brothers Brewery in Melbourne, Henry's of Harcourt (VIC) and LOBO Cider in the Adelaide Hills as well as Paracombe Premium Perry also in the Adelaide Hills. Few traditional European <b>Perry</b> <b>pears</b> are available, {{it is believed that}} Moorcroft, Gin, Green Horse & Yellow Huffcap varieties are in Australia. [...] Eating pears are generally used with differing results in Australia. Australian Food Standards permit up to 25% of apple juice in <b>Perry</b> or <b>Pear</b> cider. The importation of pear ciders from abroad include brands such as Weston's, St Helier, Magners, Rekorderlig and Kopparberg now available. The only true Perry imported comes from Weston's where it also has the European Union Geographical indication protection. Weston's also import an Organic Pear Cider into Australia.|$|R
5000|$|The {{production}} of traditional perry {{began to decline}} during the 20th century, {{in part due to}} changing farming practices - <b>perry</b> <b>pears</b> could be difficult and labour-intensive to crop, and orchards took many years to mature. The industry was, however, to a certain degree revived by modern commercial perry making techniques, developed by Francis Showering of the firm Showerings of Shepton Mallet, Somerset, in the creation of their sparkling branded perry Babycham. Babycham, the first mass-produced branded perry, was developed by Showering from application of the Long Ashton Institute's research, and was formerly produced from authentic <b>perry</b> <b>pears,</b> though today it is produced from concentrate, the firm's pear orchards having now been dug up. Aimed at the female drinker at a time when wine was not commonly available in UK pubs, Babycham was sold in miniature Champagne-style bottles; the drink was for many years a strong seller and made a fortune for the Showering family. Another competing brand of light perry, Lambrini, is manufactured in Liverpool by Halewood International, and marketed under the slogan [...] "Lambrini Girls Just Wanna Have Fun". It now dominates the light perry market and has a somewhat downmarket image in Britain. The Irish drinks company Cantrell and Cochrane, Plc (C&C), more famous for its Magners and Bulmers ciders, launched a similar light perry, Ritz, in 1986.|$|R
50|$|Like {{commercial}} pale lager {{and commercial}} cider, commercial perry is highly standardised, and today often contains {{large quantities of}} cereal adjuncts such as corn syrup or invert sugar. It is also generally of lower strength, and sweeter, than traditional perry, and is artificially carbonated to give a sparkling finish. However, unlike traditional perry it is a consistent product: the nature of <b>perry</b> <b>pears</b> means {{that it is very}} difficult to produce traditional perry in commercial quantities. Traditional perry was overwhelmingly a drink made on farms for home consumption, or to sell in small quantities either at the farm gate or to local inns.|$|R

50|$|Pears are {{consumed}} fresh, canned, as juice, and dried. The juice {{can also be}} used in jellies and jams, usually in combination with other fruits, including berries. Fermented pear juice is called <b>perry</b> or <b>pear</b> cider and is made {{in a way that is}} similar to how cider is made from apples.|$|R
50|$|By {{the sixteenth}} and seventeenth century, however, perry making had become well {{established}} in the west of England, where the climate and soil was especially suitable for pear cultivation. In the three counties of Worcestershire, Gloucestershire and Herefordshire in particular, as well as in Monmouthshire across the Welsh border, it was found that <b>perry</b> <b>pears</b> grew well in conditions where cider apple trees would not. Smaller amounts were also produced in other cider-producing areas such as Somerset. Perry may have grown in popularity after the English Civil War, when the large numbers of soldiers billeted in the Three Counties became acquainted with it, and reached a zenith of popularity during the eighteenth century, when intermittent conflicts with France made the importing of wine difficult. Many farms and estates had their own orchards, and many varieties of pear developed that were unique to particular parishes or villages.|$|R
40|$|The INRA pear {{rootstock}} {{breeding programme}} {{is dealing with}} interspecific hybridization between the INRA pear rootstock 'Pyriam' as female and Pyrus species as male parents in order to introduce new agronomic traits. INRA Pyrus species germplasm contains a large range of phenotypes and the pear rootstock breeding programmes {{have led to a}} wide range of dwarfing to vigorous selections. Cytogenetic characterization, done by flow cytometry, has shown that the analyzed Pyrus species are diploids as well as the released rootstocks. It has also shown that the group of <b>perry</b> <b>pears,</b> belonging to the P. nivalis species, contains diploid and triploid genotypes. As P. nivalis dwarfing rootstocks selections are aneuploids, further investigations by evaluation of the total DNA content and chromosome number counting have been done. The results demonstrate that dwarfing in Pyrus is linked with an aneuploid structure found in hybrids between a P. nivalis triploid genotype and a Pyrus species diploid one...|$|R
5000|$|In {{more recent}} years, {{commercial}} perry {{has also been}} referred to as [...] "pear cider", but some organisations (such as CAMRA) do not accept this as a name for the traditional drink. The National Association of Cider Makers, on the other hand, disagrees, insisting that the terms <b>perry</b> and <b>pear</b> cider are interchangeable. [...] An over twenty-fold increase of sales of industrially manufactured [...] "pear cider" [...] produced from often imported concentrate makes the matter especially contentious.|$|R
5000|$|Alcoholic {{beverages}} {{made from}} the fermentation of sugars derived from non-grain sources are generally not called [...] "beer," [...] despite being produced by the same yeast-based biochemical reaction. Fermented honey is called mead, fermented apple juice is called cider, fermented pear juice is called <b>perry</b> (sometimes, <b>pear</b> cider), fermented plum juice is called plum jerkum, and fermented grape juice is called wine. Chinese jiu and Japanese sake are made using much the same process as beer with one additional step in the fermentation as well as using rice instead of primarily barley malt.|$|R
50|$|With hard cider sales on the {{increase}} in the American alcoholic beverage market, the production of perry has increased alongside, with many craft cideries making <b>perries</b> (typically called <b>pear</b> cider in the United States) alongside their apple ciders. As the craft beer and cider industries took off in the United States in the 1990s, a few players experimented with perries. One of the first commercially available domestic perries in the US was Ace Cider's Perry Cider, introduced in 1996. Today, even mass market brands, such as MillerCoors' Crispin Hard Cider Company and Boston Beer Company's Angry Orchard, are producing perries.|$|R
