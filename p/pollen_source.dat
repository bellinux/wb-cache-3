25|$|Beekeepers may harvest honey from July until October, {{according}} to the honey flows in their area.

Exterminators therefore often offer bee-safe and honey-safe treatment methods targeted towards beekeepers.

40|$|International audienceAbstractPollination is an {{ecosystem}} service sustained by a differentiated {{use of resources}} among sympatric species. The bee size can influence the similarity {{in the use of}} resources, and poricidal anthers limit the access to pollen. Therefore, we evaluated the influence of body size and the anther type of <b>pollen</b> <b>sources</b> in Centridiniâ€“flower interaction network. We expected that the low niche overlap, promoted by these morphological parameters, would result in the formation of subgroups and lead to greater network resilience. We studied 15 bee species (n[*]=[*] 73 females) and identified their <b>pollen</b> <b>sources.</b> The bee size and anther type influenced the formation of subgroups in the community, and the larger bees used a higher proportion of flowers with poricidal anthers. Only the anther type influenced the robustness of the network. We conclude that the parameters analyzed influence both the use of resources by oil-collecting bees and their food niche breadth...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHomomorphic {{self-incompatibility}} (SI) {{evolved in}} many plant families to enforce selfing avoidance, and {{is controlled by}} a single multiallelic locus (the S-locus). In a fragmented landscape, strong variation in population size and in local density is expected to cause strong variation in allelic diversity at the S-locus, which could generate an Allee effect on female reproductive success by constraining compatible pollen availability. In this experimental study, we aimed at detecting this SI-specific Allee effect (or S-Allee effect) in the endangered species Biscutella neustriaca. We demonstrated the occurrence of a SI mating system in the species and determined compatibility relationships among genotypes through a large set of controlled pollinations. For the experiment, we chose three different pollen receptor genotypes, each compatible with respectively 100, 75 and 25 % of four other genotypes, which constituted the <b>pollen</b> <b>sources.</b> We placed different ramets of each receptor at different distances from the <b>pollen</b> <b>sources</b> to control for pollen limitation due to low local density, and we measured the seed set on each receptor plant three times consecutively. Analyses performed with generalized linear mixed models showed that both {{the distance to the}} <b>pollen</b> <b>sources</b> and the mate availability due to SI had a significant effect on seed set, with a strong reduction observed when mate availability was limited to 25 %. Our results suggest that pollen limitation due to a restriction in compatible mate availability could occur in small or scattered populations exhibiting low allelic diversity at the S-locus...|$|R

40|$|Apis dorsata {{is one of}} the {{important}} honeybee species in tropical and subtropical regions that forage on various plants including herbs, grasses, forest trees and plantation trees.

The objectives of this study were: (1) to identify the <b>pollen</b> <b>sources</b> of Apis dorsata and (2) to develop a pollen atlas for selected plants foraged by Apis dorsata. Pollen cell samples from twenty one different colonies of Apis dorsata combs were collected, identified and quantified based on several reference materials. A total of twelve different <b>pollen</b> <b>sources</b> were identified in the samples. Pollen sizes were 8 - 9 x 38 - 40 Î¼m, comprising five different shape classes. Inaperturate granulum pollen grains were observed in Ceiba pentandra and Garcinia hombroniana while rugulate grains were found in Mangifera indica. Pantoporate, syncolpate and pericolpate pollen grains with reticulum to microreticulate exine patterns occurred in Acacia auriculiformis, Melaleuca cajuputi and Ixora congesta. Elaeis guineensis showed trichotomosulcate pollen grains with a microreticulate sexine. Pantocolpate areola pollen was found in Mimosa pudica while granulum pollen was observed in Cocos nucifera. Anacardium occidentale showed a disulcate grain with a striate sexine pattern. Pollen grains of Averrhoa carambola and Dimocarpus longan were tricolpate and fossulate perforate to striate perforate.
