50|$|IAP charts are {{aeronautical}} charts that {{portray the}} aeronautical data {{that is required}} to execute an instrument approach to an airport. Besides depicting topographic features, hazards and obstructions, they depict the procedures and airport diagram. Each <b>procedure</b> <b>chart</b> uses {{a specific type of}} electronic navigation system such as an NDB, TACAN, VOR, ILS/MLS and RNAV. The chart name reflects the primary navigational aid (NAVAID), if {{there is more than one}} straight-in procedure or if it is just a circling-only procedure. A communication strip on the chart lists frequencies in the order they are used. Minimum, maximum and mandatory altitudes are depicted in addition to the minimum safe altitude (MSA) for emergencies. A cross depicts the final approach fix (FAF) altitude on NPAs while a lightning bolt does the same for PAs. NPAs depict the MDA while a PA shows both the decision altitude (DA) and decision height (DH). Finally, the chart depicts the missed approach procedures in plan and profile view, besides listing the steps in sequence.|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate flight crew performance of the "Precision Descent," a new cockpit procedure designed to support the Descent Advisor (DA), one of the components in a new air traffic control advisory system called the "Center-TRACON Automation System" (CTAS). The DA predicts when aircraft will reach a specific waypoint on the arrival route, and presents controllers with clearance advisories designed to improve the sequencing of arriving aircraft. The effectiveness of the DA depends on the aircraft's descent trajectory: where it begins descent, what speed it maintains, how fast and at what altitude it crosses the bottom-of-descent waypoint. The Precision Descent allows controllers to assign these descent parameters to the flight crew. A Field Evaluation of the DA was conducted in Denver in 1995. Three separate clearances using standard ATC phraseology were used to support the cockpit descent procedure during this evaluation. The number and length of these clearances caused problems for both controllers and flight crews, causing readback errors, repeat requests and procedure misunderstandings. These observations led to a focus group meeting in which controller and pilot participants in the 1995 FE assisted in the redesign of the procedure. The Precision Descent eliminates one clearance used in the earlier study, and greatly reduces {{the length of the}} remaining clearances. This was accomplished by using non-standard clearance phraseology that relies on a published <b>procedure</b> <b>chart</b> for correct interpretation. Eight type-rated flight crews flew eight Precision Descents in a Boeing 747 - 400 simulator. No training was provided: crews received either a <b>procedure</b> <b>chart</b> or a <b>procedure</b> <b>chart</b> with a flight manual bulletin describing procedure techniques. Video and digital data were recorded for each descent. Preliminary results indicate that moving information from the verbal clearance to the chart was successful: the shorter clearances and the procedure's default crossing restriction were understood, and procedure compliance of 81 % was observed across all descents on six independent compliance measures. Some readback errors and procedure misunderstandings were still observed, however; particularly when descent clearances deviated from the normative procedure...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In the author’s opinion, Spot Welding <b>Procedures</b> <b>Chart</b> D. 1 (hereafter {{referred}} to as Figure D. 1) in Appendix D of International Standard ISO 15609 - 5 [1] is not accurate in principle. This figure is not suitable for materials need exerting forging force for spot welding such as aluminum alloy, especially hard aluminum alloy, for it does not correctively reflect loading moment of forging force. In the author’s opinion, the loading moment of forging force given by Figure D. 1 is too late, which {{will lead to the}} generation of crack. In addition, two important reasons equally considered to advance loading moment of forging force are: (1) different spot welding equipments have different response time for welding pressure; (2) electric response speed is faster than that of mechanical or pneumatic mechanism, that is to say, response speed of current shall be faster than implementation speed of forging force. Is this paper, we discuss such above-mentioned kinds of different situations. We suggest advancing the forging force in Figure D. 1 to the maintenance course of welding current. We propose an amended spot welding course schematic diagram and a simplified schematic diagram...|$|R
