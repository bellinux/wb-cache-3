5000|$|Construction {{accounting}} {{is a form}} {{of project}} accounting applied to construction projects. See also production accounting. Construction accounting is a vitally necessary form of accounting, especially when multiple contracts come into play. The construction field uses many terms not used in other forms of accounting, such as [...] "draw" [...] and <b>progress</b> <b>billing.</b> Construction accounting may also need to account for vehicles and equipment, {{which may or may not}} be owned by the company as a fixed asset. Construction accounting requires invoicing and vendor payment, more or less as to the amount of business done.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} method for {{tracking}} policy ideas in legislation. In the US Congress, {{only a very small}} proportion of bills become law. Surviving bills likely serve as vehicles for policy ideas originating in other bills, but there is currently no reliable way to learn when this occurs. Using the legislative history of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as our test bed, we investigate whether ”text reuse” methods can help to shed additional light on policy development and lawmaking. In particular we ask whether lawmaking is more inclusive when judged in terms of the progress of ideas rather than the <b>progress</b> of <b>bills.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The {{progress}} of legislation {{is a widely}} used metric of congressional research. Yet studies that rely on the <b>progress</b> of <b>bills</b> to test important institutional and behavioral theories rarely consider whether a bill’s subject affects its success. We illustrate why accounting for bill content may be important. Next we propose a general typology for distinguishing bill subjects by their scope and by the urgency of required action. Finally we apply this typology to a longstanding subject of congressional research – studies of legislative effectiveness and bill success – to show how controlling for bill type can inform and perhaps revise our current understandings of important institutional and behavioral questions...|$|R

Peel (who normally, even in opposition, deprecated obstruction of government business by backbenchers) supported Ashley: he held very different views on the issue from Ashley, but the issue was important, contentious, {{and should not be}} evaded : [...] "so long as ineffectual attempts at legislation remained on the table of the house, the excitement of the manufacturing districts would continue to be kept up" [...] Ashley's motion was lost narrowly 111 to 119.|$|R

40|$|Many emphasise {{the need}} for {{policies}} that support women's agency in highly coercive settings, {{and the importance of}} involving target women in public deliberation to inform policy design. The Ugandan Marriage and Divorce Bill seeks to strengthen women's agency in marriage, but has faced many obstacles, including objections from many women themselves in public consultations. We explore key stakeholders’ accounts of the difficulties facing the <b>Bill's</b> <b>progress</b> to date, through focus groups with 24 rural and urban men and women, interviews with 14 gender champions in government, non-governmental organisations and legal sectors, and 25 relevant media and radio reports. Thematic analysis revealed an array of representations of the way the <b>Bill's</b> <b>progress</b> was shaped by the public consultation process, the nature of the Ugandan public sphere, the understanding and manipulation of concepts such as ‘culture’ and ‘custom’ in public discourse, the impact of economic inequalities on women's understandings of their gendered interests and low women's trust in the law and the political process. We discuss the complexities of involving highly marginalised women in public debates about gender issues and highlight possible implications for conceptualising agency, gender and social change as tools for gender policy and activism in extreme inequality...|$|R
