2500|$|The {{prototype}} of the LaGG-3, I-301, was designed by Semyon A. Lavochkin, Vladimir P. Gorbunov and Mikhail I. Gudkov. It was designated LaGG-3 in serial production. Its airframe was partially made of wood delta-veneer (a resin-wood multi-ply veneer composed of very thin, 0.35 to 0.55mm, wood veneer and phenol formaldehyde resin, baked at high temperature and pressure) used for the crucial parts. This novel construction material had tensile strength {{comparable to that of}} non-hardened aluminum alloys and only 30% lower than that of <b>precipitation</b> <b>hardened</b> D-1A grade [...] duralumin. It was also incombustible and completely invulnerable to rot, with service life measured in decades in adverse conditions. The full wooden wing (with plywood surfaces) was analogous to that of the Yak-1. The only difference was that the LaGG's wings were built in two sections. The fuselage was of similar construction to the MiG-3's. The LaGG-3's armament consisted of a 20mm ShVAK cannon, with 150 rounds, which was installed in the motornaya pushka in the cylinder block split- between the [...] "V" [...] of the engine cylinders and firing through a hollow propeller shaft, and two synchronized 12.7mm Berezin UBS machine guns with 170 rpg. Consequently, the combined weight of rounds fired per second was 2.65kg/s, making the LaGG-3 superior in burst mass to all contemporary Russian fighters, particularly to the MiG-3. Most other Russian fighters of that era were considered under-gunned in relation to western contemporary fighters. This is somewhat true even for the Yak-1, which had a 20mm cannon and two 7.62mm machine guns, but not the later versions of the Polikarpov I-16, which had two cannons and two machine guns.|$|E

The precipitation of S" on dislocations is the predominant cause of strengthening during the initial stage of <b>precipitation</b> <b>hardening</b> (up to 30 min at 180 degrees C). Guinier-Preston-Bagaryatsky (GPB) zones (or better, the recently introduced "Cu/Mg clusters") also appear in the initial stage, but their contribution to the hardness. which up to now was considered to be predominant, is shown to be smaller then the one of the S" precipitates. Since the density of the S" nucleation sites is related to the amount of dislocations, this mechanism is important in the case of a bake hardening treatment when ageing is preceded by cold deformation. Uniform S" precipitation has also been found at the later ageing stage, which suggests that the contribution of S" to the <b>precipitation</b> <b>hardening</b> at that stage is not less important.

40|$|Abstract. In this study, the <b>precipitation</b> and <b>precipitation</b> <b>hardening</b> {{behavior}} of a 0. 3 %V and 2 %Cu bearing middle carbon steel has been investigated in comparison {{with that of a}} 0. 3 %V bearing steel and a 2 %Cu bearing steel.

The amount of the <b>precipitation</b> <b>hardening</b> of the 0. 3 %V and 2 %Cu bearing steel is nearly equal to the sum of the <b>precipitation</b> <b>hardening</b> of the 0. 3 %V bearing steel and the 2 %Cu bearing steel In the 0. 3 %V bearing steel, precipitates were observed in rows, which indicates the occurrence of the interphase precipitation while precipitates observed in the 2 %Cu bearing steel were randomly dispersed.

5000|$|During {{hydrogen}} embrittlement, {{hydrogen is}} {{introduced to the}} surface of a metal and individual hydrogen atoms diffuse through the metal. Because the solubility of hydrogen increases at higher temperatures, raising the temperature can increase the diffusion of hydrogen. When assisted by a concentration gradient where there is significantly more hydrogen outside the metal than inside, hydrogen diffusion can occur even at lower temperatures. These individual hydrogen atoms within the metal gradually recombine to form hydrogen molecules, creating pressure from within the metal. This pressure can increase to levels where the metal has reduced ductility, toughness, and tensile strength, up {{to the point where it}} cracks open (hydrogen-induced cracking, or HIC). Though hydrogen atoms embrittle a variety of substances, including steel, aluminium (at high temperatures only), and titanium, hydrogen embrittlement of high-strength steel is of the most importance. Austempered iron is also susceptible, though austempered steel (and possibly other austempered metals) display increased resistance to hydrogen embrittlement. Steel with an ultimate tensile strength of less than 1000 MPa (~145,000 psi) or hardness of less than 30 HRC is not generally considered susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement. In tensile tests carried out on several structural metals under high-pressure molecular hydrogen environment, it has been shown that austenitic stainless steels, aluminium (including alloys), copper (including alloys, e.g. beryllium copper) are not susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement along with a few other metals. [...] As an example of severe hydrogen embrittlement, the elongation at failure of 17-4PH <b>precipitation</b> <b>hardened</b> stainless steel was measured to drop from 17% to only 1.7% when smooth specimens were exposed to high-pressure hydrogen.|$|E
50|$|Magnesium alloys, {{especially}} <b>precipitation</b> <b>hardened</b> alloys, {{are used}} in casting. Sand, permanent mold and die casting methods are used, but plaster-of-Paris casting {{has not yet been}} perfected. Sand casting in green-sand molds requires a special technique, because the magnesium reacts with moisture in the sand, forming magnesium oxide and liberating hydrogen. The oxide forms blackened areas called burns {{on the surface of the}} casting, and the liberated hydrogen may cause porosity. Inhibitors such as sulfur, boric acid, ethylene glycol, or ammonium fluoride are mixed with the damp sand to prevent the reaction. All gravity-fed molds require an extra high column of molten metal to make the pressure great enough to force gas bubbles out of the casting and make the metal take the detail of the mold. The thickness of the casting wall should be at least 5/32 in. under most conditions. Extra-large fillets must be provided at all re-entrant corners, since stress concentration in magnesium castings are particularly dangerous.Permanent mold castings are made from the same alloys and have about the same physical properties as sand castings. Since the solidification shrinkage of magnesium is about the same as that of aluminium, aluminium molds can often be adapted to make magnesium-alloy castings (although it may be necessary to change the gating).Pressure cold-chamber castings are used for quantity production of small parts. The rapid solidification caused by contact of the fluid metal with the cold die produces a casting of dense structure with excellent physical properties. The finish and dimensional accuracy are very good, and machining is necessary only where extreme accuracy is required. Usually these castings are not heat treated.|$|E
