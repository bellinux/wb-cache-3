5|$|The castle is {{approached}} {{through the}} castle meadow, {{an area of}} open parkland, lined with Holm oaks planted in the 1860s, and is surrounded by the dry moat, now a garden dating from at least the 1850s and <b>planted</b> <b>with</b> trees and shrubs. Adjacent to the castle are the Queen Mother's Garden and the kitchen garden and glasshouses. The Queen Mother's Garden was built by English Heritage as a 95th birthday gift for the then Lord Warden in 1997, the site having been originally part of the wider kitchen gardens, before being turned into a tennis court in the 1920s. Designed by Penelope Hobhouse, the garden incorporates classical and Islamic themes, with a 92-foot-long (28 m) pool, a viewing mound and a classical pavilion. The two glasshouses have been restored, functioning as cold greenhouses, while {{the remainder of the}} kitchen garden is <b>planted</b> <b>with</b> a mixture of vegetables, fruit trees and flowers.|$|E

40|$|Wheat {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{essential}} foods in the world. To increase its productivity, nutrient man-agement {{is one of the}} most important factors. To assess the possible role of micronutrients in im-proving wheat yield, an experiment was conducted to evaluate the wheat performance by foliar application of micronutrients. Treatments consist of T 1 = No spray, T 2 = Spraying <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> tube well water (control), T 3 = Spraying <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> 1. 6 kg FeSO 4 / 100 L water/acre, T 4 = Spraying <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> 3 kg ZnSO 4 (21 %) / 100 L water/acre, T 5 = Spraying <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> 1 kg MnSO 4 / 100 L wa-ter/acre, T 6 = Spraying <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> (FeSO 4 + MnSO 4), T 7 = Spraying <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> (FeSO 4 + ZnSO 4), T 8 = Spraying <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> (ZnSO 4 + MnSO 4), and T 9 = Spraying <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> (FeSO 4 + ZnSO 4 + MnSO 4).

40|$|Chromosome pairing was {{studied at}} {{metaphase}} I in PMCs by C-banding in diploid rye <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> 1 – 3 monosomic-substitution wheat chromosomes and 1 monosomic-addition wheat chromosome. In <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> chromosome 5 A, no univalents were found. In other <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> 1 monosomic-substitution wheat chromosome (7 A, 2 A, or 1 A), only rye univalents occurred, on average 0. 02 – 0. 18 per PMC. Wheat chromosomes paired with homoeologous rye chromosomes in bivalents. The addition chromosome 6 A occurred as a univalent with a frequency of 0. 92 per PMC. In <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> 2 – 3 monosomic-substitution wheat chromosomes, no univalents were found. In 2 diploid rye <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> substitution chromosomes 2 A, 5 A and in 1 <b>plant</b> <b>with</b> 2 A, 7 A, wheat chromosomes paired mainly with rye homoeologues, {{but sometimes they}} paired with each other, forming heteromorphic wheat bivalent. In the other 3 <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> wheat chromosomes 2 A, 5 A, 2 <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> 2 A, 7 A, and 4 <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> 5 A, 7 A, a reverse situation was observed: nonhomoeologous wheat chromosomes paired with one another (forming a heteromorphic bivalent) more frequently than with rye homoeologues. In <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> 3 substitution wheat chromosomes (2 A, 5 A, 7 A), 2 of them paired with each other, forming first of all a heteromorphic ring bivalent, while the third wheat chromosome paired with a rye chromosome in a ring bivalent or rarely in a rod bivalent. Wheat chromosomes sporadically occurred in multivalents. The presented data show that the rye genome promotes both homoeologous pairing of wheat and rye chromosomes and nonhomoeologous pairing of wheat chromosomes...|$|R

40|$|The {{causes of}} poor {{fertility}} and female infertility of Swedish clover <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> reduced leaves were investigated.

The ovaries of <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> reduced leaves are frequently not coalesced and the ovules hang out beyond the ovary on tong funiculus.

40|$|Inheritance {{study of}} {{groundnut}} {{indicated that a}} single dominant gene governed the flower with red stripe on standard. All F 1 plants had red stripe on standard. The segregation of F 3 : 2 families (derived from individual F 2 plants) showed 1 : 2 : 1 expected ratio (χ 2 = 0. 659) of 1 non-segregating (<b>plants</b> <b>with</b> red stripe on standard) to 2 segregating (<b>plants</b> <b>with</b> red stripe on standard and <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> no red stripe on standard) to 1 non-segregating (<b>plant</b> <b>with</b> no red stripe on standard). When the F 3 groundnut families which had <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> red stripe on standard were combined, the segregation ratio was not different from the 3 : 1 Mendelian ratio (χ 2 = 0. 073). The symbols for standard flower trait were designated St for dominant trait and st for recessive trait. For peg's color characteristic, the <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> red stripe on standard flower had purple peg. It {{is possible that the}} red stripe on standard flower gene had a pleiotropic effect on peg color or this may indicate linked genes. For characters of pod, the F 1 showed moderately reticulate pods. The segregation of F 3 : 2 families showed also a 1 : 2 : 1 expected ratio (χ 2 = 0. 067) giving 1 non-segregating (<b>plants</b> <b>with</b> reticulate pod) to 2 segregating (<b>plants</b> <b>with</b> reticulate pod and <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> smooth pod) to 1 non-segregating (<b>plants</b> <b>with</b> smooth pod). When the F 3 groundnut families which had <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> reticulate pod were combined, the segregation ratio was not different from the 3 : 1 Mendelian ratio (χ 2 = 0. 065). The results indicated that pod characters were governed by a single gene. The symbols of pod character were designated Re for dominant gene and re for recessive gene. For yield components study, the F 3 generation had lower yield than their parents did but some of them had similar yield with their parents. Yield components were highly correlated with each other. In addition, yield components of F 3 families were also correlated with their leaf characters. The <b>plants</b> <b>with</b> larger leaf had bigger pods, more prolific pods, and heavier seeds...|$|R
