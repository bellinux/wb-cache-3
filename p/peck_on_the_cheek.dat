She informed Cooper in 1947, following a weekend in the country with Anthony Eden, at which the only other guest was the French Ambassador to Britain, that Eden [...] "never stops trying to make love to her".

What's more, {{he does the}} little things that are unbecoming of a millionaire. He looks people in the eye when they talk to him, as if he cares about what they're saying. He frequently doles out handshakes, half-hugs and, to women, <b>pecks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheek.</b> He returns phone calls. He mends fences, lifts spirits, makes others feel special." [...] Following a community outreach event, Gwen Knapp of the San Francisco Chronicle stated that [...] "Jackson couldn't have been more charming or more engaged, the perfect face of the franchise." ...|$|R

The peck and ceremony were emblematic, as they sought to remove traditional restrictions on courtship practices and celebrate love as liberating. Many who attended the wedding found the joyous moment to be a symbol of hope and happiness. Their marriage {{was seen as a}} light backdrop to the movement; Li referred to it as “marriage <b>on</b> <b>the</b> execution ground.” Toward the end of his memoir, Moving the Mountain, Li does not mention his married life after <b>the</b> crackdown <b>on</b> June 4.

60|$|Miss Deemas strode up to Miss Tippet, and <b>pecked</b> her <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right <b>cheek,</b> much as {{an eagle}} might peck a tender rabbit, which it could slay and devour if it chose, but which it {{preferred}} to spare for a time. She was immediately introduced to Mr Tippet, whom she favoured with a stiff bow, intended to express armed neutrality in the meantime; with a possibility, if not a probability, {{of war in the}} future. The eccentric gentleman felt chilled, but ventured to express an opinion in regard to the weather, glancing for confirmation of the same towards the window, through which he naturally enough expected to see the sky; but was baffled by only seeing the green venetian blinds, which ruled off the opposite houses in narrow stripes. Before he had recovered himself to make any further observation, Miss Deemas had attempted, in a condescending way, to peck <b>the</b> <b>cheek</b> of Emma Ward; but that young lady, feeling disinclined, so managed that she received <b>the</b> <b>peck</b> <b>on</b> her forehead.|$|R

Kiss-and-Ride is usually conducted when the train/bus/ferry station is close to home, so that the driver doing dropping the commuter off has a short journey to and from home.|$|E
50|$|Kannathil Muthamittal (A <b>Peck</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cheek)</b> is a 2002 Indian Tamil-language musical war drama film written, {{produced}} {{and directed by}} Mani Ratnam. It features Madhavan, P. S. Keerthana and Simran in the leading roles with Nandita Das, J. D. Chakravarthy, Prakash Raj and Pasupathy portraying other pivotal characters. The film's score and soundtrack were composed by A. R. Rahman, while Ravi K. Chandran handled the cinematography. Mani Ratnam presents {{the story of a}} child of Sri Lankan Tamil parentage adopted by Indian parents, who desires to meet her biological mother {{in the midst of the}} Sri Lankan Civil War.|$|E
50|$|The {{title of}} the film was finally {{announced}} as Kannathil Muthammittal (A <b>peck</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheek)</b> in July 2001, after a famous phrase from a poem written by Subramanya Bharathi. Parts of the film shown to be Colombo in the film were shot in Puducherry. Further schedules were {{carried out in the}} forests of Kerala to depict the base of the LTTE in northern Sri Lanka. As most of the cast were non-native Tamil speakers, dubbing artistes were used with actresses Sukanya and Deepa Venkat lending their voices for Nandita Das and Simran respectively. Furthermore, Mounika lent her voice for Easwari Rao's character, while Thalaivasal Vijay spoke lines for Chakravarthy.|$|E
40|$|A pigeon's rate of <b>pecking</b> <b>on</b> a red key, {{reinforced}} at {{a constant}} frequency, may be changed by increasing or decreasing the frequency of reinforcement of <b>pecking</b> <b>on</b> a successively presented green key. The changes in <b>the</b> rate of <b>pecking</b> <b>on</b> red, called interactions, are of two types: contrast, in which the changes in <b>the</b> rates of <b>pecking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> two colors are in opposite directions; and, induction, in which {{the changes in the}} rates are in the same direction. In previous data, a change in the frequency of reinforcement associated with the green key produced a corresponding change in the rate of pecking the green key and an opposite change (contrast) in <b>the</b> rate of <b>pecking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> red key. The present data suggest that the magnitude of contrast is very small if <b>pecking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> red key is reinforced at a high enough frequency (about 40 reinforcements per hr in the present experiment). Also, given that interactions occur, induction rather than contrast may result from small changes in a low frequency of reinforcement associated with green...|$|R

Tom is also in the competition with Colin but loses in the last round. Tom takes Hannah out for a walk, hoping to tell her how he feels. The other bridesmaids interrupt for Hannah's bachelorette party. On her Hen Night, Hannah parades around a pub and sells her kisses for change. As she goes around, Hannah then kisses Tom. Though it just started as a <b>peck</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheek,</b> it turns into a passionate kiss.|$|E

5000|$|When Eoin {{eventually}} leaves, he is {{annoyed by}} the fact that he has to wear the cakejumper, which is covered in crumbs and large chunks of dough. However, he kindly gives Mrs Doyle a <b>peck</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheek</b> and thanks her, which leads to her fainting again. Patsy invites Ted onto the show, Dougal having told her how much Ted is always trying to get on TV. Ted initially declines, but quickly agrees when he hears there's a cash prize. Eoin's obtuse behaviour is finally explained with the line, [...] "I've no willy". When Ted appears on the quiz, he breezes through the first round answering questions on his specialist subject—William Shatner's TekWar—and gets through to the final round, where Eoin asks him what should be a simple question for a priest: what was John Paul II's name before he became Pope? However, Ted does not know. After struggling to think of the answer throughout the closing credits, he finally offers a guess of [...] "Jim".|$|E

40|$|A within-subjects {{comparison}} {{was made}} of pigeons' performance on two temporal discrimination procedures that were signaled by differently colored keylight samples. During stimulus trials, a <b>peck</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> key displaying a slanted line was reinforced following short keylight samples, and a <b>peck</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> key displaying a horizontal line was reinforced following long keylight samples, regardless of the location of <b>the</b> stimuli <b>on</b> those two choice keys. During position trials, a <b>peck</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left key was reinforced following short keylight samples and a <b>peck</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right key was reinforced following long keylight samples, regardless of which line stimulus appeared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> correct key. Thus, <b>on</b> stimulus trials, <b>the</b> correct choice key could not be discriminated prior to {{the presentation of the}} test stimuli, whereas <b>on</b> position trials, <b>the</b> correct choice key could be discriminated during the presentation of the sample stimulus. During Phase 1, with a 0 -s delay between sample and choice stimuli, discrimination learning was faster on position trials than on stimulus trials for all 4 birds. During Phase 2, 0 -, 0. 5 -, and 1. 0 -s delays produced differential loss of stimulus control under the two tasks for 2 birds. Response patterns during the delay intervals provided some evidence for differential mediation of the two delayed discriminations. These between-task differences suggest that the same processes may not mediate performance in each...|$|R
50|$|Even after {{everything}} that had happened, Blindfold still couldn’t get David out of her mind. Using astral projection, she decided to spy on him and found him at a strange religious cult called the Church of the Happy Host. When the church leaders gave David a pill {{to see whether or}} not he was a mutant, Blindfold managed to dispose of the pill without anyone knowing. Blindfold soon realized that the cult was actually the one that had corrupted her brother years ago and was furious with David for being there. When he soon let on that he knew she was watching, she told him off for meddling in things he shouldn’t. As he was explaining his intentions, though, he let slip that he considered the meeting a date and Blindfold started blushing. When he was called away by the church leader, she gave him a <b>peck</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cheek</b> and continued to watch over him. David managed to work events so that the church goers were arrested by SWORD for supposed crimes that David committed. As they were taken away, Ruth thanked David for dishing out some justice on the hateful group. Ruth left too but not before she made it clear to David she would be interested in seeing him again. Without Ruth realizing, though, David managed to get his hands on a diary full of prophesies that Luca had written and left at the church.|$|E
