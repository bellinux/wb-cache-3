5000|$|The {{principle}} of nonviolence (Ahimsa) applied to animals {{is connected with}} the intention to avoid negative karmic influences which result from violence. The suffering of all beings is believed to arise from craving and desire, conditioned by the karmic effects of both animal and human action. The violence of slaughtering animals for food, and its source in craving, reveal flesh eating as one mode in which humans enslave themselves to suffering. Hinduism holds that such influences affect the <b>person</b> <b>who</b> permits the slaughter of an animal, the <b>person</b> <b>who</b> kills it, the <b>person</b> <b>who</b> cuts it up, the <b>person</b> <b>who</b> buys or sells meat, the <b>person</b> <b>who</b> cooks it, the <b>person</b> <b>who</b> serves it up, and the <b>person</b> <b>who</b> eats it. They must all be considered the slayers of the animal. [...] The question of religious duties towards the animals and of negative Karma incurred from violence (himsa) against them is discussed in detail in Hindu scriptures and religious law books.|$|R

The question of whether SV40 causes cancer in humans remains controversial however, and the development of improved assays for detection of SV40 in human tissues will be needed to resolve the controversy.|$|E
