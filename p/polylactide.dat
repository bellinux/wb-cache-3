25|$|In semi-{{crystalline}} polymers, the crystalline {{regions are}} considered to be gas impermeable. Due to relatively high crystallinity, in combination with the ability of the nanofibers to form a dense network held together by strong inter-fibrillar bonds (high cohesive energy density), {{it has been suggested that}} nanocellulose might act as a barrier material. Although the number of reported oxygen permeability values are limited, reports attribute high oxygen barrier properties to nanocellulose films. One study reported an oxygen permeability of 0.0006 (cm3µm)/(m2daykPa) for a ca. 5µm thin nanocellulose film at 23°C and 0% RH. In a related study, a more than 700-fold decrease in oxygen permeability of a <b>polylactide</b> (PLA) film when a nanocellulose layer was added to the PLA surface was reported.|$|E

The aluminum-salalen complexes were found to polymerize all varieties of lactide, namely: L-, D-, rac- and meso-lactide, and showed moderate productivities. rac-LA gave rise to isotactic <b>polylactides</b> (with Pm up to 72 %), while meso-LA gave rise to heterotactic <b>polylactides</b> (with a Pm of 79 %). An experiment was designed for distinguishing between chain-end control and enantiomorphic-site control combined with polymeryl exchange for the isotactic stereoblock microstructure observed for the PLA produced from rac-LA; it gave strong evidence for polymeryl exchange between propagating species.

40|$|Branched and {{crosslinked}} degradable polyesters {{based on}} lactic acid, lactide and ε-caprolactone were prepared by utilizing different polymerization methods. Chain linking of hydroxyl telechelic lactic acid oligomers with 1, 6 -hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDI) as a chain extender, yielded lactic acid based poly(ester-urethanes). When {{an excess of}} HMDI was used, polymers with broader molecular weight distribution and long-chain branching were obtained. Long-chain branching was confirmed by NMR and was seen in high shear thinning and melt strength in rheological measurements.

As observed in solution, the presence of the DMAP center dot HX (X Cl, CH 3 SO 3, CF 3 SO 3) salt enhanced yields. Linear and star-like <b>polylactides</b> with 3 and 4 branches were prepared. <b>Polylactides</b> were thus easily prepared reaching high molar masses (up to 75 000 g mol(- 1) for linear PLLA and 140 000 g mol(- 1) for star-like PLLA) with good control in less than 1 h.

40|$|Blends of {{isotactic}} <b>polylactides</b> of opposite configurations lead to {{the formation}} of stereocomplexes, provided the enantiomeric excess of the two homopolymers in contact is high enough. In this study, the stereocomplex formation between a poly(L-lactide) (100 L) having an enantiomeric excess of 100 % and a poly(D-lactide) having an enantiomeric excess of 80 % (80 D) has been investigated using differential scanning calorimetry and optical microscopy. These results have been compared to those obtained between two <b>polylactides</b> having both an enantiomeric excess of 100 % (100 L/ 100 D blend). The melting temperatures of blends 100 L/ 100 D and 100 L/ 80 D are 230 and 208 degrees C, respectively. In both cases, the stereocomplex formation is preferred to the homopolymer crystallization and the stereocomplex controls the morphology of the blends over a wide range of concentrations. However, this control is more rigorous when the D component is 100 % isotactic. This difference leads to a more complete crystallization of homopolymer 100 L and to a greater influence of crystallization conditions in 100 L/ 80 D blends in comparison with 100 L/ 100 D blends. An epitaxial crystallization between the homopolymer 100 L and the stereocomplex 100 L/ 80 D has also been observed at certain compositions. Peer reviewe...|$|R
