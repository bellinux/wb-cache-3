40|$|Hydrophobic PEO {{coatings}} were fabricated in an electrolyte containing <b>potassium</b> <b>stearate.</b> The wetting behaviour of coated samples was studied using {{dynamic and}} static contact angle. Also, the corrosion behaviour {{of the samples}} was evaluated by polarization method. The dynamic contact angle and hysteresis of the contact angle for PEO coating were evaluated by Wilhelmy plate method. There {{was an increase in}} the contact angle of the nanocomposite and traditional PEO coatings when <b>potassium</b> <b>stearate</b> was added to the electrolyte up to 130 °. The more hydrophobic coatings, showed more corrosion resistance in 3. 5 wt. % NaCl solution. The synergistic effect of <b>potassium</b> <b>stearate</b> and nanoparticles increased the hydrophobicity because of assembling of fatty acid on ceramic powder...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: High-quality point {{clouds are}} {{the bases of}} high-accuracy {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) model. How to obtain the corresponding surface point clouds is always an important work in reverse engineering. Faro Laser Scanner Fonton 120 was used to scan an organic material which is composed of <b>potassium</b> <b>stearate,</b> sodium stearate, polyvinyl alcohol and paraffin liquid in a dark room. The organic material has fewer reflectors and is penetrated by laser of scanner. For increasing the reflector and obtaining high-accuracy 3 D model, the flash sliver was coated on organic material’s surface. Flash sliver was found not only increasing the high reflector but also preventing laser penetrating. It indicated that coating flash sliver was an efficient method to obtain high-quality point clouds. These findings have supplied a basis for 3 D laser scanner appling {{to the field of}} organic material...|$|E
40|$|A thin <b>potassium</b> <b>stearate</b> (KSt) film {{combined}} with an optimized ZnO film was introduced to improve the fill factor (FF) of highly efficient inverted polymer solar cells (PSCs). Atomic force microscopy and contact angle measurements were used {{to show that the}} introduction of KSt did not change the morphology of interlayer. On the contrary, it is beneficial for the spread of the active layer on the interlayer. The origin of enhanced FF was systematically studied by the ideal current-voltage model for a single heterojunction solar cell and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. On the basis of the data analysis, the reduced charge recombination loss was responsible for this improved FF. At last, when KSt was replaced by sodium stearate (NaSt), the similar experiment phenomenon was observed. This indicates that inserting a metallic stearate modified layer is a promising strategy to enhance inverted PSCs performance. Published by AIP Publishing...|$|E
50|$|It is {{also the}} main {{component}} of soap scum, a white solid that forms when soap is mixed with hard water. Unlike soaps containing sodium and <b>potassium,</b> calcium <b>stearate</b> is insoluble in water and does not lather well.Commercially it is sold as a 50% dispersion in water or as a spray dried powder. As a food additive it is known by the generic E number E470.|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} of structural changes of double ionic layer at mesomorphous transitions of sodium and potassium stearates {{has been carried}} out with IR spectroscopy method. We managed to trace correlation of frequencies of valent oscillation bands of carboxylate-ions with their coordination in <b>potassium</b> <b>stearate,</b> obtained by the method of X-ray structure analysis. The performed calculations of frequencies, forms and intensity of νСОО-oscillation bands with various types of coordination for isolated propionate-ion, monodentate and chelated bidentate complexes correlate with experimentally observable data. The whole body of data collected by DSC, X-ray structure analysis and obtained IR spectroscopy makes it possible to assume, that double ionic layer remains constant up to the moment of the transition to isotropic liquid. The scheme of structural rearrangements at phase transitions of investigated soaps has been put to consideration. The changes of liquid-crystal properties at temperature variations of sodium and potassium salts of fatty monocarboxylic acid...|$|E
40|$|Studies on the {{properties}} of soaps are of importance because of their common use as detergents, {{in the preparation of}} vaccines, in the treatment of disease, and because of their natural occurrence in the animal body where they may have some effect in deter-mining the resistance of the animal organism to infection. Reichenbach (1908) studied the action of soaps on Escherichia coli and found that <b>potassium</b> <b>stearate,</b> pahmitate, and myristate were effective in killing this organism, while the oleate, erucate, and linoleate were inactive. Walker (1924 - 1926) showed that sodium and potassium soaps of the same acid did not vary greatly in their germicidal action. The lower members of the series such as the butyrate, valerate, caprylate, and caproate, had little or no germicidal effect. He found the pneumococcus to be very susceptible to laurates, oleates linoleates, and linolenates. Streptococci were killed much like the pneumococci but at higher concentrations of the soap. Escherichia coli, Eberthella typhi, Shigella paradysenteriae, Sal-monella paratyphi were killed by moderate concentrations (N/ 20 to N/ 40) of the saturated soaps (laurates to stearates) but were very resistant to the unsaturated soaps. Eggerth (1926 - 1931) studied the germicidal action of alpha substituted soaps. He found that the soaps of the alpha bromo fatty acids were usually more germicidal than the unsubstituted. The alpha hydroxy soaps exhibited a high germicidal activit...|$|E
