50|$|When the Dumbarton Rail Bridge was in use, boaters would {{signal the}} operator, who would start a diesel engine and rotate {{the bridge to}} the open {{position}} on a large gear. The bridge could swing open or closed in two minutes. The bridge has now been <b>welded</b> <b>permanently</b> into the open position.|$|R
5000|$|The prison houses {{many foreign}} prisoners. It is a harsh prison that handles death row and long-sentence prisoners. All prisoners are {{required}} to wear leg irons {{for the first three}} months of their sentences. Death row inmates were required to have their leg irons <b>permanently</b> <b>welded</b> on, although this practice ended in 2013. In the book The Damage Done, former prisoner and drug courier Warren Fellows recounts that the prison was nicknamed [...] "Big Tiger" [...] by the Thais because it [...] "prowled and ate". Fellows's associate Paul Hayward also served part of his sentence there.|$|E
50|$|MV Delphin is {{a cruise}} ship owned by the India-based Vishal Cruises Pvt. Ltd., under charter to the Germany-based Passat Kreuzfahrten. Built 1975 by Oy Wartsila AB in Finland and renovated 1986 and 1993 by Lloyd Werft, Bremerhaven, Germany and got {{converted}} into {{a cruise ship}}, with her bow unloading doors <b>permanently</b> <b>welded.</b> In 1992, while being serviced at Singapores Singmarine Dockyard, she toppled over when a floating dock sank with her in it. In 1993, she went through renovations at Lloyd-Werft again and got completely modernized and elegantly re-equipped. At the same time, the Delphin Seereisen and later Delphin-owned Hansa Kreuzfahrten of Germany, had been chartered until bankruptcy. The ship was managed by MTC Marine Trade Consulting GmbH.|$|E
5000|$|Semi-automatic carbine version, {{featuring}} a 6.5 inch barrel with a 9.5 inch muzzle device <b>permanently</b> <b>welded</b> to it, {{which is actually}} {{a modified version of}} the baffle core of the integrally suppressed variant. SIG contended that this device was a muzzle brake, but in 2013 the BATFE ruled that the component was a suppressor, and classified the MPX-C as possessing an integral silencer and thus as a Title II NFA weapon. The BATFE rejected an appeal against this ruling in February 2014; SIG responded by filing a civil lawsuit against the BATFE, alleging they had acted in an [...] "arbitrary and capricious manner". In September 2015, Federal Judge Paul Barbadora upheld the BATFE's ruling.|$|E
50|$|The station {{came on the}} air in 1958 as KPOR, 1,000 watts, daytime only, {{licensed}} to Donald R. Nelson, and utilized an aluminum tower and a Collins 20V-1 transmitter. Nelson, and his wife Ann, operated the station for over ten years from a building which formerly contain a bank. With the door <b>welded</b> <b>permanently</b> open, the station used the abandoned bank vault for a news room. KPOR serviced Quincy and the surrounding farming community with a country music format. During program testing prior to officially going on the air, a crop dusting airplane crashed into the tower's guy wires. The tower crashed to the ground and, with some of the guy wires dangling from its wings, the plane made it safely back to its airport at Wenatchee, Washington.|$|R
50|$|Everyday manual wheelchairs come in {{two major}} varieties, folding or rigid. Folding chairs are {{generally}} low-end designs, whose predominant advantage {{is being able to}} fold, generally by bringing the two sides together. However this is largely an advantage for part-time users who may need to store the wheelchair more often than use it. Rigid wheelchairs, which are increasingly preferred by full-time and active users, have <b>permanently</b> <b>welded</b> joints and many fewer moving parts. This reduces the energy required to push the chair by eliminating many points where the chair would flex and absorb energy as it moves. Welded rather than folding joints also reduce the overall weight of the chair. Rigid chairs typically feature instant-release rear wheels and backrests that fold down flat, allowing the user to dismantle the chair quickly for storage in a car. A few wheelchairs attempt to combine the features of both designs by providing a fold-to-rigid mechanism in which the joints are mechanically locked when the wheelchair is in use.|$|E
50|$|The {{technique}} {{consists of}} stitching together plywood panels {{with some sort}} of wire or other suitable device, such as cable ties or duct tape and staples. All these methods of stitching or suturing the plywood panels of the hull are simple methods of clamping the hull parts together before they are <b>permanently</b> <b>welded</b> or fused by epoxy and fiberglass tape joints. Once the epoxy sets solid in most cases the stitches or other clamping structures are removed leaving only the fused plywood panels behind. Copper wire is popular because the wires can be twisted tighter or looser to precisely adjust fit, and because it is easy to sand after gluing, and it is suitable in a marine environment if left in place, but mild steel electric fencing wire can be used just as easily and then can be removed completely from the hull structure. To join, the cut panels are drilled with small holes along the joining edges and stitched. Once together, the joint is glued, usually with thickened epoxy and fiberglass {{on the inside of the}} hull.|$|E
50|$|In around 1942 the Swiss army {{initiated}} a competition {{for a new}} service machine gun to replace both the “heavy” MG 11 and the “light” Lmg25, adopted in 1911 and 1925 respectively. Three participants joined the competition-government-owned Waffenfabrik Bern, and privately owned factories SIG and Hispano-Suiza. Waffenfabrik Bern based its development on the hugely successful German MG 42. The first prototypes emerged in around 1944, and looked much like MG42, although the shape of receiver and butt was somewhat different. The final design, which appeared in 1950, was in most respects similar to the MG 42, although many parts were produced by machining instead of stamping, and the locking system was changed from roller to flap locking. The resulting weapon was heavier than the German original, and much more finely made and finished. In certain respects it was a “Rolex” of machine guns. Until very recently MG 51 served as a primary infantry and vehicle machine gun for Swiss army, although it is now being gradually replaced in service with lighter and less expensive, but also less powerful 5.56mm FN Minimi machine gun of Belgian origin and manufacture. The MG 51 is a short-recoil-operated, locked breech, air-cooled and automatic only, belt-fed weapon. It uses a modified MG 42 type locking system with a two-piece bolt and dual locking flaps located in the front part of the bolt. These flaps engage the cuts made in the short barrel extension to provide rigid locking. Upon recoil, the flaps are retracted {{toward the center of}} the bolt, to unlock it. An additional lever-type bolt accelerator is provided; it is located in receiver, next to the barrel breech and below the bolt. The gun housing also somewhat resembles the German MG 42, although it is made from two separate parts - the barrel jacket (made from stamped steel) and receiver (a solid machined body). The barrel jacket is <b>permanently</b> <b>welded</b> to the front of the receiver. The barrel can be changed rapidly if required; the barrel change procedure is similar to that of the MG 42, with the locking latch located at the right side of the jacket, which is opened to provide a barrel replacement window.|$|E
40|$|Thermal energy welded {{material}} unevenly {{heated and}} thus supports {{the creation of}} tension. During the fusing process welding transient tensions generated in the welded material. Generation of the transient tensions depends on the thermal expansion and fixed <b>permanently</b> <b>welded</b> parts. Tensions {{are the result of}} the interaction of material particles. For welded parts and constructions it is necessary to know the size and direction of application of tensions. The emerging tensions can cause local change or a total deformation of welded materials. Deformations and residual stresses impair the performance of a welded construction, reduces the stability of the parts. To reduce or eliminate of action or a screening direction stresses and strains it is necessary to know the mechanism of their emergence. It is now possible to examine the emergence of tensions numerical experiments on any model using numerical simulation using FEM. Results of numerical experiment is the analysis of stress and deformation course. In the plane the tension it divided into normal σ and τ tangential folders. Decomposition stress on components simplifies the stress analysis. The results obtained from numerical analysis are correct to predict the stress distribution and size. The paper presents the results of numerical experiments stress analysis solutions fillet welds using FEM numerical simulation of welding of non-ferrous metals...|$|E
40|$|Passive, secure cells (PSCs) {{have been}} used for over 50 years at the Sellafield nuclear site in the UK for {{radioactive}} processing plants. PSCs are designed and constructed with the expectation {{that there will be no}} need to enter them throughout the life of the plant. EnergySolutions has full and exclusive rights in North America to use the intellectual property and knowhow generated at the Sellafield site and this includes all the design and operational data for PSCs. These data are thus available for use in the new build of nuclear plant currently being envisaged under the GNEP initiative. There are three types of PSC. Type 1 PSCs contain plant items with no maintainable moving parts, and pipework is all welded and radiographed to nuclear standards. Type 2 PSCs contain plant items with slowly rotating or intermittently moveable parts, but all maintainable items such as motors and gearboxes are located outside the cell, with sealed through-cell-wall drives. Type 3 PSCs are a newer design, dating from the 1980 s, in which all maintainable in-cell items are designed as removable modules. The housings for the equipment are <b>permanently</b> <b>welded</b> into the in-cell pipework, and the modules can be withdrawn from these housings, through removable hatches in the PSC roof, into shielded steel “flasks”. The flasks are moved to a maintenance cell where the modules are repaired or prepared for disposal. The process is reversed to re-instal...|$|E
40|$|Presented on April 26, 2016 at 12 : 00 p. m. in room 1116 of the Marcus Nanotechnology Building. Amanda Stockton is an Assistiant Professor in the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Georgia Tech. Her {{research}} centers around three related astrobiological themes: {{the analysis of}} extraterrestrial organic molecules {{in the search for}} life beyond Earth, fingerprinting life at Earth’s extremes, and exploring the origins of biomolecules and the emergence of life. Runtime: 50 : 44 minutesMicrofluidics offers multiple unique and powerful tools with which to address astrobiology’s big questions, including “Is there life beyond Earth?” One key microfluidic technology in the search for life beyond Earth is the Extraterrestrial Organic Analyzer (EOA) microcapillary electrophoresis (CE) laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection system. EOA, because it uses a programmable microfluidic architecture (PMA) in tandem with µCE-LIF, enables rapid, automated, and extremely sensitive analyses of organic biomarkers (down to 70 pM or sub pptr) including amines, amino acids, dipeptides, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The PMA, based on normally-closed or lifting-gate monolithic membrane microvalves, enables automated sample processing with complex fluidic manipulation including mixing, dilution, labeling, and transfer for analysis of multiple compound classes within minutes. EOA technology has been proposed for Mars rover missions and Enceladus fly-by missions. Recent work in our group has looked at hardening the technology for a 50, 000 g 5 km/s impact mission for Europa. This requires the entire optical subsystem be assembled with sub-micron precision and <b>permanently</b> <b>welded</b> as a single monolithic stack. It also requires that we transition from pneumatically-actuated microvales to hydraulic valves with incompressible fluids. This talk will present an overview of EOA, with detailed descriptions of the microfluidics that makes this technology possible...|$|E
