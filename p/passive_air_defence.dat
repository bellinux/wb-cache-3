50|$|For {{the next}} ten years this {{committee}} looked into issues of new aerial weapons development and the possible impact on civilians. The use of gas attacks in the First World War played heavy on the decisions and protection via gas masks was a core decision taken by the committee.

Together with ideas around the building of air raid shelters, evacuations of people and blackout requirements these were all termed <b>passive</b> <b>air</b> <b>defence.</b>|$|E
