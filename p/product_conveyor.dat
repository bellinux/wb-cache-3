The task of the plant is to pick randomly incoming <b>products</b> from a <b>conveyor</b> belt which can never be stopped, and pack them into boxes with multiple capacity, with the goal to lose as less products as possible.

In addition, the optimal scheduler decides also the speeds of the conveyors, to maximize the throughput.

50|$|A Fork lift can be {{arranged}} {{in more ways than}} an L-shaped conveyor or a platform lift and a spiral conveyor. A fork-lift is a product lift which lifts <b>products</b> from a <b>conveyor</b> using a fork and then places them at a different level on another conveyor. Such a fork-lift makes it possible to introduce or remove products at an angle of 90 degrees. As a result, the number of possible input and output combinations is somewhat larger. Because of the possibility of sliding conveyors in or out of the lift, a fork-lift can also be used as a vertical sorting system. With such a sorting installation, a product can be entered and removed at any level and a product can be lifted and lowered using one lift. The power and thus the energy consumption of the drive is considerably lower with a fork-lift than with other systems, since only the product weight needs to be transported and the forks maintain a balance between each other in the rising and lowering section. Another difference between a fork-lift and an L-shaped conveyor or platform lift is the complexity of the control. With an L-shaped conveyor or platform lift, input and output must be completely synchronous, whereas this is not necessary with a fork-lift. This ensures considerably simpler controls.|$|R

40|$|The Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) {{technology}} has been widely applied to labeling moving objects. In some RFID application scenarios, e. g., <b>product</b> checking on <b>conveyor</b> belt, the tags labeled on the products need to be identified and accessed before {{moving out of the}} reader's probing range. Due to the uncertainty of ALOHA protocol and unreliability of wireless links, passing tags will suffer from collisions and link failures, and then move away without successful response. One important requirement for RFID systems is to reliably identify and access all the tags. There is naturally a tradeoff between system throughput and reliability, e. g., tag may have no chance to successfully respond in high moving speed and system throughput drops in low tag moving speed. In this paper, we introduce an integrated software system Reliable Splitting Aware ALOHA (RSAA), which is used to improve system throughput while maintaining a threshold of tag loss probability. Given a tag loss probability, RSAA is able to approach to the optimal system throughput. We implement RSAA on our NI EPC Class 1 Generation 2 UHF RFID Reader Emulator to read and access commercial tags. Experiments in indoor and outdoor scenarios are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of RSAA. Compared with moving unaware schemes, RSAA can reliably enhance the throughput by 50 %similar to 100 %. We further use trace-driven simulation to show that RSAA is able to support diverse tag density and large-scale UHF RFID systems...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{secondary}} packaging plants is to pick food <b>products</b> from a <b>conveyor</b> belt and {{to place them}} into boxes. The typical configuration of these packaging plants consists {{of a set of}} sequential robot stations, performing pick and place cycles from one conveyor to another parallel one, which transport the products and the boxes to be filled. Depending on the relative movement of the two conveyors, the plant operates in co-current or counter-current flow configuration. Undesired perturbations in the product flow rate from its nominal value can lead to critical events, i. e. unpicked product {{at the end of the}} first conveyor or not-completely filled boxes. Even if the structures of co-current flow and of counter-current flow plants, are very similar, their behaviour in non-nominal or perturbed conditions can be significantly different. The aim of this paper is to deeply investigate the behaviour of these two kinds {{of secondary}} packaging lines, evaluating their performances in the case of different pick and place strategies, using discrete events simulation techniques. Results show to which extent the different proposed control strategies can improve the performances of both co-current and counter-currents plants and, in particular, how co-current plant layouts can achieve performances which are equivalent to, or perhaps even better than, those that can be obtained with a counter-current plant layout, that cannot be freely used since it has been patented.

Different carbon blacks, as well as different accelerators and silica are shown to have a great influence on the amount of rubber adhesion to brass plated steel wire. The state of the wire plating as well as the contamination of its surface affects bonding and these parameters were studied using the scanning electron microscope. XPS techniques are employed to explain the role of some accelerators in the mechanism of bonding rubber to brass plated steel wire. A relationship has been found to exist between bind strength and rubber fracture properties.

50|$|The {{advantage}} of a spiral conveyor {{is that it can}} be used with a minimum amount of control software. The disadvantages are that a relatively large area (floor space) is required compared with other product lifts and vertical transport takes {{a great deal of time}} on account of the number of cycles which the transport belt completes. Certain products can also become misshapen since they are transported at an angle. One only has to think of plastic bottles which are wrapped in clingfilm which can become permanently misshapen if the clingfilm has still not completely cooled. A product is only supported at two angles on a spiral conveyor, because of the lifting angle and the radius within which the transport conveyor is placed. If a product has to be supported so that it is flat during transport, this will not be possible with a spiral conveyor. The drive motor of a spiral conveyor must always be controlled with a frequency regulator in order to prevent excessive slippage of the transport belt. It is also necessary to take account that products must not touch at intake. If products are touching each other at intake, the products can become jammed, which can result in the transport belt breaking down. It is, therefore, recommended that a good feed mechanism be provided for a spiral conveyor. In the case of most spiral <b>conveyors,</b> <b>products</b> must also be presented centrally, as the eccentric loading of spiral conveyors can cause excessive slippage. If a product becomes stuck for any reason, there is a good to a very good chance that the lamellae of the transport belt will disintegrate, which can cause a considerable loss in production along the whole of the production line, something which is associated with huge additional costs for replacements.|$|R

In the future, the system could be also applied in the grading of other delicate fruits such as guava, wax apple and honey peach. 本研究主要目的，旨在開發一套楊桃採收後分級處理作業系統，具有秤重、分級判斷、級數顯示、語音分級判讀等功能，主要由電腦語音重量分級系統及資料自動化處理軟體系統所組成，包括電腦、秤量裝置、相關控制軟體、輸送機、印表機與條碼機等設備。利用此系統進行電腦重量分級，以提高分級精確度，並建立分級作業資料庫、自動計價管理、自動分析資料，即時提供交易明細，以供帳務處理。 經由試驗得知電腦語音重量分級系統，在不拆紙袋的分級作業方式下，分級作業能力每小時為 1300 粒；於集貨處理場配合輸送機分級楊桃之作業能力每小時為 750 粒，作業能力為原來利用人工處理的三至四倍，分級精確度可達 96 %以上，秤量值的誤差皆在± 5 公克之內，穩定性高，此種分級方式確可達到零損傷與提高分級精確度，是一套適合楊桃採收後分級儲運管理作業自動化之系統，未來可應用於番石榴、蓮霧、水蜜桃等精緻水果之分級。誌謝辭	i 中文摘要	ii Abstract	iii 目 錄	v 表目錄	viii 圖目錄	ix 第一章 緒 論	 1 1. 1 前言	 1 1. 2 研究動機	 2 第二章 研究目的	 3 第三章 文獻探討	 4 3. 1 楊桃採收後處理現況	 4 3. 2 楊桃品質分類標準	 7 3. 3 微電腦與秤量裝置之應用	 8 3. 4 電子式重量選別機	 9 3. 5 資料庫管理系統之應用	 10 3. 6 語音辨識系統之應用	 10 3. 7 條碼於農業上的應用	 11 第四章 理論分析與應用	 12 4. 1 Delphi基本操作與環境設定	 12 4. 1. 1 Delphi整合開發環境	 12 4. 1. 2 Delphi 編程架構	 16 4. 1. 3 專案的編譯與執行	 19 4. 1. 4 Delphi的資料庫元件	 19 4. 1. 5 BDE管理員與ACCESS連線設定	 21 4. 1. 6 De 1 phi安裝系統需求	 23 4. 2 Microsoft Access 資料庫管理系統	 24 4. 3 多媒體應用	 26 4. 4 電腦與通訊協定	 28 4. 5 條碼識別系統	 30 第五章 分級處理作業系統之建立	 31 5. 1 系統架構	 31 5. 2 分級處理作業系統作業流程規劃	 32 第六章 分級處理作業系統設計	 34 6. 1 分級處理作業系統硬體設備	 34 6. 2 分級處理作業系統軟體之開發	 40 6. 2. 1 電腦語音重量分級系統控制軟體撰寫內容	 42 6. 2. 2 資料管理自動化系統與主功能操作視窗之建立	 44 6. 3 條碼標籤系統之規劃設計	 51 第七章 實驗設備、材料與方法	 52 7. 1 實驗配置	 52 7. 2 實驗設備	 54 7. 3 實驗材料	 59 7. 4 實驗方法	 60 7. 4. 1 楊桃分級實例之調查實驗	 60 7. 4. 2 楊桃橫斷面面積、長度與重量之關係實驗	 60 7. 4. 3 楊桃採收後分級處理作業系統之測試	 63 7. 4. 4 電腦語音重量分級機分級精確度測試	 65 7. 4. 5 作業能力測試	 66 7. 4. 6 機械損傷程度測試	 67 第八章 結果與討論	 68 8. 1 楊桃產地分級實例調查結果與討論	 68 8. 2 楊桃橫斷面面積、長度與重量之關係實驗結果與討論	 71 8. 2. 1 楊桃橫斷面面積與重量之關係實驗結果與討論	 72 8. 2. 2 楊桃長度與重量之關係實驗結果與討論	 74 8. 3 分級處理作業系統軟體之測試結果與討論	 76 8. 3. 1 靜態穩定性測試實驗結果與討論	 76 8. 3. 2 取果實振動對系統影響測試實驗結果與討論	 77 8. 3. 3 分級處理作業系統軟體可行性之測試結果與討論	 78 8. 4 電腦語音重量分級機分級精確度試驗結果與討論	 85 8. 5 作業能力測試結果與討論	 86 8. 5. 1 電腦語音重量分級機單機作業能力測試結果	 86 8. 5. 2 現場分級作業能力測試結果	 87 8. 6 機械損傷程度測試結果與討論	 87 第九章 結論與建議	 90 9. 1 結 論	 90 9. 2 建 議	 91 第十章 參考文獻	 92 附 錄	 95 附錄 1 楊桃採收後分級處理作業系統使用說明	 95 附錄 2 卓蘭農會果菜市場楊桃分級實例重量值	 112 附錄 3 楠西鄉集貨處理場楊桃分級實例重量值	 112 附錄 4 楊桃投影面積、長度與重量之量測值	 113 附錄 5 靜態穩定性測試之重量值(一) 	 114 附錄 6 靜態穩定性測試之重量值(二) 	 116 附錄 7 頂層位置取果實振動對系統影響測試結果	 118 附錄 8 內層位置取果實振動對系統影響測試結果	 118 附錄 9 卓蘭農會果菜市場特大級楊桃秤量結果	 11...|$|R
