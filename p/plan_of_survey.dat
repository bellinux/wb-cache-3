50|$|The Ohio Company petitioned Congress in March, 1792 {{to donate}} some land {{along the north}} {{boundary}} of their lands to form a buffer against the Indians. With the Act of April 21, 1792, Congress donated 100000 acre to the officers of the Company. The land was to be conveyed in lots of 100 acre, free of expense, to each male of at least 18 years of age who settled on the land. The Donation Tract is in parts of modern day Adams, Fearing, Salem, Muskingum, Palmer, Waterford, and Watertown Township in Washington County, and Windsor Township in Morgan County. The land was divided into “allotments”, and each allotment was further divided into 100 acre lots. These lots did not follow the usual surveying <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>survey</b> townships and one square mile sections. That part of the tract that was not conveyed by the Company to settlers within five years was {{to be returned to}} the federal government. However, nothing was done about the unsold lots until an act in 1818, when Congress required their return so they could be sold by the Marietta Land Office. After settlement of the Donation Tract, the Ohio Company did not suffer another raid as large as the Big Bottom Massacre.|$|E

This point was selected because of the available water power and of the likelihood that main roads from east to west would pass here. The town became a railroad and manufacturing center and justified the wisdom of its founders. An elaborate circular, called the [...] "Articles of Association for the City of Mount Carmel," [...] was issued at Chillicothe in 1817. The purpose of the association was announced to be [...] "to build a city on liberal and advantageous principles, and to constitute funds for the establishment of seminaries of learning and for religious purposes." [...] The proprietors reserved for themselves one-fourth of the lots, these being called [...] "proprietors' lots;" [...] one-fourth were called [...] "private donation lots." [...] The <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>survey</b> and sale was described as follows: [...] "The in-lots are six poles in front, and eleven and a half in back; containing each sixty-eight perches, nearly half an acre. The most of the out-lots contain four acres and eight square poles; some of them more, (five and six acres on the back range); and a few of them less. There are 748 in-lots, and 331 out-lots --1079 in the whole.|$|E

Traditionally, the team used paper maps or CAD drawings to present the proposal which is not {{an efficient way to}} present and share idea on the site investigation proposal such as sitting of borehole location or seismic survey lines. This paper focuses on how a GIS approach can be utilised to develop a web-based system to support decision making process in the <b>planning</b> <b>of</b> geological <b>survey</b> works and also to plan site activities carried out by Singapore Geological Office (SGO). The authors design a framework of building an interactive web-based GIS system, and develop a prototype, which enables the users to obtain rapidly existing geological information and also to plan interactively borehole locations and seismic survey lines via a web browser. This prototype system is used daily by SGO and has shown to be effective in increasing efficiency and productivity as the time taken in the <b>planning</b> <b>of</b> geological <b>survey</b> works is shortened.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{documented}} a noticeable disparity between design and operating speeds. An {{important reason for}} driving errors on two-lane rural roads is the misjudgment of road users concerning the real course of the road. Most {{of the problems we}} can detect at the road infrastructure on two-lane rural roads are related to unfavorable conditions of visibility. Inadequate sight distance is an important aspect and their availability influences driver’s behavior with a increase of the hazard. Mathematical models were developed to estimate vehicular speed on curves; in particular the 85 th percentile speed for curves was estimated by using the radius of the curve under consideration, the radius of the previous curve and sight distance. The experimental investigation has been conducted employing traffic counters, able to record, for every vehicular passage in both senses: length, instant speed and direction of the vehicle. The <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>survey</b> has been elaborated to satisfy different objectives of search (speed in free flow conditions, in entry and in gone out of the intersections, in rural to urban transition, etc.) and it has been applied to some roads belonging to the network of the Province of Salerno. The measures have been performed holding every section under observation for 2 or 3 hours. Then the data have been used for starting the formalization of some analytical relationships to predict the operating speeds...|$|E
40|$|The {{prediction}} {{of the operating}} speeds is a very remarkable aspect for the adjustment planning of the existing road network. The problem can be solved more easily on curve than on tangent, because the drivers’ behaviour depends on few factors as curvature, slope and adherence. Instead, on tangent, the elements that influence the adopted speeds are more numerous. They are related to different features, like length, radius of preceding and following curves, transversal section, vertical alignment, etc. Numerous studies have been conducted, in different Countries and on various typologies of roads, to determine, {{on the basis of}} the statistic analysis of instrumental direct measurements, the links among operating speeds and some characteristic parameters of the roads. The objective of this experimental study is to get relationships of general validity for the prediction, in phase of project, of the speeds that will be indeed practiced on the infrastructure. The experimental investigation, object of the present paper, has been conducted employing traffic counters, able to record, for every vehicular passage in both senses: length, instant speed and direction of the vehicle. The <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>survey</b> has been elaborated to satisfy different objectives of search (speed in free flow conditions, in entry and in gone out of the intersections, in rural to urban transition, etc.) and it has been applied to some roads belonging to the network of the Province of Salerno. The measures have been performed holding every section under observation for 2 or 3 hours. Then the data have been used for starting the formalization of some analytical relationships to predict the operating speeds. This paper introduces a prediction model of operating speed and the other parameters of free flow conditions on more than 36 tangents. In meaningful way, the surveyed speeds are correlated to the entrance one that depends on geometric parameters of the preceding curve...|$|E
40|$|The {{models that}} {{correlate}} the road characteristics and the operating speed on tangent are studied {{all around the}} world. Although the issue of speeds on tangent sections has not been studied extensively, several U. S. and international researchers have studied operating speeds and average running speeds, design speeds, speed limits, {{and the impact of}} geometric and traffic measures on speeds. The objective of this experimental study is to get relationships of general validity for the prediction, in phase of project, of the speeds that will be indeed practiced on the infrastructure.

Speeding is a general problem in traffic and exploring factors underlying the choice of speed is an important task. The relationship between various measures of traffic speed, under free flow conditions, and speed limits is investigated in Southern Italy. The effect of speed limits on traffic speed is estimated. Increased speeding will likely result in augmenting the number of traffic accidents, as well as the severity of the injuries, resulting from high-speed accidents. Many drivers are aware of the negative effects of speed, exceeding the speed limit is nevertheless one of the most frequent traffic violations. This paper introduces a prediction model of operating speed and the other parameters of free flow conditions. In meaningful way, the surveyed operating speeds, always superior to posted speed limits, are correlated to the entrance one that depends on geometric parameters of the preceding curve...|$|E

40|$|Validation is a {{familiar}} topic in computing, generally as a mechanism to protect a database {{from the effects of}} inappropriate data with the side effect of detecting some errors. As such, the validation rules are determined from the database schema using well understood methodologies. This paper takes a different view by examining digital validation as one of a set of processes that are designed to ensure that the incoming data (in this case, a <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> cadastral <b>survey)</b> is unambiguous and contains sufficient detail to define the legal spatial extents of a property. This is a complex question, especially since the rules and the decisions based on these processes must be defensible (therefore cannot contain arbitrary requirements imposed by a specific database model). Using the jurisdiction of Queensland, Australia, as a case study, this paper discusses the manual submission and lodgement <b>of</b> cadastral <b>survey</b> <b>plans</b> and the current 2 D digital process as precursors to the automatic lodgement <b>of</b> all <b>plans</b> <b>of</b> <b>survey.</b> A set <b>of</b> validation rules is proposed for application to single geometric objects, to the relationship of objects on a single survey plan, and to objects that are independently defined on separate plans. It is asserted that, {{by the nature of the}} problem, this set is incomplete and will remain so. However, this research has identified a 'checklist' of issues to be addressed by jurisdictions hoping to implement digital cadastral survey plan lodgement. The implications of this work in the context of the broader challenges in land administration and within the topic of 3 D cadastral data are discussed. ...|$|R

Total age, settlement date, age at settlement, and birth date were determined from otolith microstructure. Fish off Mendocino settled mostly in June and fish off Monterey settled mostly in May (average difference in settlement= 23 days). Although {{the difference in the}} timing of settlement followed this same pattern for both areas over the five years, settlement occurred later in 2002 and 2003 than in the prior years of sampling. The difference in the timing of settlement was due primarily to differences in birth dates for the two areas. The time of settlement was positively related to upwelling and negatively related to sea level anomaly for most of the months before settlement. Knowledge of the timing of settlement has implications for design and placement of marine protected areas because protection of nursery grounds is frequently a major objective of these protected areas.
