25|$|The Z3 computer, {{invented by}} Konrad Zuse (1941) in Germany, was a digital and {{programmable}} computer. A digital computer uses electricity as the calculating component. The Z3 contained 2,400 relays {{to create the}} circuits. The circuits provided a binary, floating-point, nine-instruction computer. Programming the Z3 was through a specially designed keyboard and <b>punched</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|E
25|$|Starting in December 1959, {{the fully}} {{automatic}} train was tested on the BMT Sea Beach Line express tracks between the 18th Avenue and New Utrecht Avenue stations. The train {{was equipped with}} a telephone system to keep voice communication with human dispatchers at the two shuttle terminals. At each station there was a cabinet that housed 24 relay systems that made up electronic dispatchers. The relays controlled the starting of the train, the acceleration, braking, and stopping of the train, {{as well as the}} opening and closing of the car doors. The relays were operated by electrical impulses initiated by a <b>punched</b> <b>tape.</b> When operating at full speed, the train operated at 30 miles per hour, and the train slowed to 5.5 miles per hour when coming into the two stations. When entering stations, the train passed through a series of detectors, which caused a series of tripper arms at trackside to go into the open position if the train was going at the speed. If the train was going too quickly, the tripper arms would stay upright and the train's brakes would automatically be set.|$|E
500|$|As {{part of a}} {{demonstration}} for automation, Track 4 was briefly automated from 1962 to 1964. It was the first automated service in the New York City subway system. Starting in December 1959, the fully automatic train was tested on the BMT Sea Beach Line express tracks between the 18th Avenue and New Utrecht Avenue stations. The train was equipped with a telephone system to keep voice communication with human dispatchers at the two shuttle terminals. At each station there was a cabinet that housed 24 relay systems that made up electronic dispatchers. The relays controlled the train's starting, acceleration, braking, and stopping, {{as well as the}} opening and closing of the car doors. The relays were operated by electrical impulses initiated by a <b>punched</b> <b>tape.</b> At full speed, the train ran at , slowing to [...] when coming into the two stations. When entering stations, the train passed through a series of detectors, which caused a series of tripper arms at trackside to go into the open position if the train was going at the speed. If the train was going too quickly, the tripper arms would stay upright and the train's brakes would automatically be set. The equipment was built and installed by the General Railway Signal Company and the Union Switch and Signal division of the Westinghouse Air Brake Company, after several years of research and development. The NYCTA contributed between $20,000 to $30,000 on the project, while the bulk of it, between $250,000 and $300,000, was contributed by the two companies. The automation of the shuttle was opposed {{by the president of the}} Transport Workers Union, Michael J. Quill, who pledged to fight the project and called the device [...] "insane." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the 1950s {{through the}} 1970s, [...] "RTTY art" [...] {{was a popular}} on-air activity. This {{consisted}} of (sometimes very elaborate and artistic) pictures sent over rtty {{through the use of}} lengthy <b>punched</b> <b>tape</b> transmissions and then printed by the receiving station on paper.|$|E
2500|$|As soon as EDSAC was operational, {{it began}} serving the University's {{research}} needs. [...] It used mercury delay lines for memory, and derated vacuum tubes for logic. [...] Cycle time was 1.5 ms for all ordinary instructions, 6 ms for multiplication. [...] Input was via five-hole <b>punched</b> <b>tape</b> and output was via a teleprinter.|$|E
2500|$|Word {{processors}} are {{descended from}} the Friden Flexowriter, which had two <b>punched</b> <b>tape</b> stations and permitted switching {{from one to the}} other (thus enabling what was called the [...] "chain" [...] or [...] "form letter", one tape containing names and addresses, and the other the body of the letter to be sent). It did not wrap words, which was begun by IBM's Magnetic Tape Selectric Typewriter (later, Magnetic Card Selectric Typewriter).|$|E
50|$|Input to {{the machine}} was {{performed}} {{in the form of}} <b>punched</b> paper <b>tape,</b> after experiments with punch cards proved unsatisfactory. The machine was controlled through a console which allowed programs to be stepped through one at a time, and featured CRT displays which showed the contents of registers. Output was through a standard teleprinter or to <b>punch</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|R
50|$|The PDP-1 was {{supplied}} standard with 4096 {{words of}} core memory, 18-bits per word, and ran at a basic speed of 100,000 operations per second. It was constructed using many System Building Blocks that were packaged into several 19-inch racks. The racks were themselves packaged {{into a single}} large mainframe case, with a hexagonal control panel containing switches and lights mounted to lay at table-top height {{at one end of}} the mainframe. Above the control panel was the system's standard input/output solution, a <b>punch</b> <b>tape</b> reader and writer. Most systems were purchased with two peripherals, the Type 30 vector graphics display, and a Soroban Engineering modified IBM Model B Electric typewriter that was used as a printer. The Soroban system was notoriously unreliable, and often replaced with a modified Friden Flexowriter, which also contained its own <b>punch</b> <b>tape</b> system. A variety of more-expensive add-ons followed, including magnetic <b>tape</b> systems, <b>punched</b> card readers and punches, and faster <b>punch</b> <b>tape</b> and printer systems.|$|R
50|$|Founded in 1949 in Kent, Washington, United States by Philip Renshaw, {{the company}} was a leading {{manufacturer}} of <b>punch</b> <b>tape</b> readers. In 1970 Tally developed line matrix printer technologies and became {{a leader in the}} printer industry.|$|R
2500|$|Colossus {{included}} {{the first ever}} use of shift registers and systolic arrays, enabling five simultaneous tests, each involving up to 100 Boolean calculations, {{on each of the}} five channels on the <b>punched</b> <b>tape</b> (although in normal operation only one or two channels were examined in any run). Initially Colossus was only used to determine the initial wheel positions used for a particular message (termed wheel setting). [...] The Mark 2 included mechanisms intended to help determine pin patterns (wheel breaking). Both models were programmable using switches and plug panels in a way their predecessors had not been.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, a {{computer}} could execute only one {{program at a}} time. [...] Each user had sole use of the computer for a limited {{period of time and}} would arrive at a scheduled time with program and data on punched paper cards or <b>punched</b> <b>tape.</b> The program would be loaded into the machine, and the machine would be set to work until the program completed or crashed. Programs could generally be debugged via a front panel using toggle switches and panel lights. It is said that Alan Turing was a master of this on the early Manchester Mark 1 machine, and he was already deriving the primitive conception of an operating system from the principles of the universal Turing machine.|$|E

50|$|Backing {{store was}} {{magnetic}} drum and optionally one-inch-, half-inch- or quarter-inch-wide magnetic tape. Input was from 80-column punched cards and optionally 160-column punched cards and <b>punched</b> paper <b>tape.</b> Output was to 80-column punched cards, line printer, and optionally to <b>punched</b> paper <b>tape.</b>|$|R
50|$|The KL-7 was {{designed}} for off-line operation. It was {{about the size of}} a Teletype machine and had a similar three-row keyboard, with shift keys for letters and figures. The KL-7 produced printed output on narrow paper strips that were then glued to message pads. When encrypting, it automatically inserted a space between five-letter code groups. One of the reasons for the five letter groups was messages might be given to a morse code operator. The number of five letter groups was easily verified when transmitted. There was an adaptor available, the HL-1/X22, that allowed 5-level Baudot <b>punched</b> paper <b>tape</b> from Teletype equipment to be read for decryption. The standard KL-7 had no ability to <b>punch</b> <b>tapes.</b> A variant of the KL-7, the KL-47, could also <b>punch</b> paper <b>tape</b> for direct input to teleprinters.|$|R
50|$|Weighing 800 kg, in 1955 it {{was built}} with relays and {{stepwise}} relays. Beginning in 1957 the Z11 could be programmed by <b>punched</b> <b>tapes.</b> It consumed 2 kW of electricity, and operated mechanically at a frequency of 10 to 20 Hz. Both input and output were in decimal numbers, and it used floating point arithmetic.|$|R
50|$|The main {{units of}} the system were: keyboard, controlling-reading unit, input <b>punched</b> <b>tape,</b> output <b>punched</b> <b>tape,</b> printer, {{magnetic}} tape memory, ferrite memory, ALU (arithmetical logical unit), CPU (central processing unit), and power supply.|$|E

50|$|The Z1 {{contained}} {{almost all}} the parts of a modern computer, i.e. control unit, memory, micro sequences, floating-point logic and input-output devices. The Z1 was freely programmable via <b>punched</b> <b>tape</b> and a <b>punched</b> <b>tape</b> reader. There was a clear separation between the <b>punched</b> <b>tape</b> reader, the control unit for supervising the whole machine and {{the execution of the}} instructions, the arithmetic unit, and the input and output devices.The input tape unit read perforations in 35-millimeter film.|$|E
50|$|For storage, {{the systems}} could write out {{a stream of}} {{characters}} as they were received from the host, allowing them to be played back locally to recreate the display. Storage options included the 4911 <b>punch</b> <b>tape,</b> the 4912 using cassette tapes based on a Sykes TT120 mechanism, and later added the 4923 based on the 3M DC300 digital tape system.|$|R
50|$|The BRPE <b>tape</b> <b>punches</b> {{operate at}} 110 {{characters}} per second, with two adjustable-level versions for reading either 5 or 8-level paper tape or 6, 7 or 8-level paper tape.

5000|$|Many of the {{commands}} {{for the experimental}} parts were programmed [...] "by hand" [...] to produce the <b>punch</b> <b>tapes</b> that were used as input. During the development of Whirlwind, MIT's real-time computer, John Runyon coded a number of subroutines to produce these tapes under computer control. Users could enter a list of points and speeds, and the program would calculate the points needed and automatically generate the <b>punch</b> <b>tape.</b> In one instance, this process reduced {{the time required to}} produce the instruction list and mill the part from 8 hours to 15 minutes. This led to a proposal to the Air Force to produce a generalized [...] "programming" [...] language for numerical control, which was accepted in June 1956. Doug Ross was given leadership of the project and was made head of another newly created MIT research department.
