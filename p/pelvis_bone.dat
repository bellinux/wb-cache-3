50|$|The {{discovery}} of the backpack led to {{a new wave of}} intense searches along the Culubre. Two Ngobe women from a search party had discovered Kremers' jeans shorts which were zipped and neatly folded on top of a rock on the opposite, or eastern, bank of the tributary, a few kilometers away from the bank where Froon's backpack was discovered. Two months later, even closer to where the backpack was discovered, a boot with a foot inside was found along with a part of a <b>pelvis</b> <b>bone,</b> reportedly behind a tree. In a short time span, over 33 bones would be discovered at the same river bank, with long distances between them. DNA testing in the Netherlands eventually confirmed that they were the bones of Froon and Kremers. Of the 33 bones discovered, 28 were those of Froon's left foot. The boot was a product by a Dutch company. It still had the foot and ankle of Froon in the sock within the boot. The <b>pelvis</b> <b>bone</b> belonged to Kremers. It has also been noted, that while Froon's bones still had some skin attached to them, Kremers's bones appeared to have been bleached.|$|E
50|$|A {{diagnosis}} of Waldenström's macroglobulinemia {{depends on a}} significant monoclonal IgM spike evident in blood tests and malignant cells consistent with the disease in bone marrow biopsy samples.

A bone marrow biopsy provides a sample of bone marrow, usually {{from the back of the}} <b>pelvis</b> <b>bone.</b> The sample is extracted through a needle and examined under a microscope. A pathologist identifies the particular lymphocytes that indicate WM. Flow cytometry may be used to examine markers on the cell surface or inside the lymphocytes.|$|E

40|$|The current {{development}} of computerized tomography (CT) has {{enable us to}} obtain cross sectional image using multi slicing techniques in an order of few seconds. The obtained images represent several tissue structures on cross section slice being imaged. One challenge to help diagnosis using CT images is extracting an anatomic structure of interest using a method of image segmentation and volumetric visualization {{with the assistance of}} computers. In case of volumetric visualization of pelvis bones extracted from multi-slice CT images, whole images which are containing part of <b>pelvis</b> <b>bone</b> structures must be segmented. In this research, an image segmentation technique based on active contour is implemented for semi-automatic multi slice image segmentation. Image segmentation steps are initialized with a define model of 2 D curve on the first slice image manually. Next, its model curve is deformed to reach the final result of 2 D curve that fits to boundary edges of <b>pelvis</b> <b>bone</b> image. The final result of 2 D curve on previous slice image was used as an initialization model of 2 D curve on the next slice images. This process will continue until the final slice image. This segmentation method was compared with the segmentation method based on threshold from homogenous intensity distribution and manual segmentation method. Quantitative analysis from the results of segmentation on each slice and qualitative analysis on the representation of volumetric visualization are performed in this research...|$|E
50|$|Finding a pair {{of these}} birds for {{breeding}} is not easy because their sex is not easily determined. The sex can {{be determined by the}} distance between the <b>pelvis</b> <b>bones</b> which in males measures 1-3 mm while measuring 6-8 mm in females. The nest is built in a rock crevice or within a compartment of the large communal nests built by sociable weavers. Man-made structures such as the roofs of houses may also be used. 4-6 eggs are laid between February and April. They are dull white and measure 23.5 mm by 17.3 mm. They are incubated for about 23 days. The young birds fledge after 43 days.|$|R
50|$|Similar to the pentadactyl limb in mammals, the {{earliest}} dinosaurs {{split into two}} distinct orders—the saurischia and ornithischia. They are classified as {{one or the other}} in accordance with what the fossils demonstrate. Figure 2d, shows that early saurischians resembled early ornithischians. The pattern of the pelvis in all species of dinosaurs is an example of homologous structures. Each order of dinosaur has slightly differing <b>pelvis</b> <b>bones</b> providing evidence of common descent. Additionally, modern birds show a similarity to ancient saurischian pelvic structures indicating the evolution of birds from dinosaurs. This can also be seen in Figure 5c as the Aves branch off the Theropoda suborder.|$|R

Here, we report a case of Primary osseous Hodgkin lymphoma in a 35 -year-old male presenting with osteolytic lesions of iliac and sacral bone without other symptoms. Histopathology examination revealed Hodgkin′s disease. All other investigations (including computed tomography of the chest, abdomen and <b>pelvis,</b> <b>bone</b> marrow aspiration) were negative for occult disease.

40|$|An {{efficient}} voxel representation scheme {{coupled with}} algorithms for voxelisation, display and thickness analysis of complex free form shapes is presented. The binary voxel model is stored as {{a stack of}} layers represented as bit-arrays. Polygonal solid models are converted into voxel format with a maximum resolution of 1000 (one billion voxels) in less than 2 minutes. Near real-time visualization of the voxel model is achieved by direct point rendering using a look-up table based on a finite set of neighbour voxel configurations. Thickness analysis is performed in terms of cross-sectional visualisation, progressive skin removal and radiography with minimum, maximum and total thickness along an orthographic direction. Testing of the algorithms for intricate shapes like Ganesha idol, <b>pelvis</b> <b>bone</b> and automobile cylinder gave satisfactory results. The voxel framework can be coupled to traditional CAD/CAM systems, providing additional capabilities to product engineers...|$|E

40|$|Influence of raw ham weight, {{trimming}} {{form and}} pressing on seasoning weight loss of Istrian dry-cured hams were studied. Swine thighs were shaped traditionally with skin and subcutaneous fat removed. The <b>pelvis</b> <b>bones</b> {{were left in}} the ham (B hams) or experimentally deboned (boneless or BL hams). After trimming the raw hams were weighted and classified into the weight classes. The hams were pressed after dry salting with different loads. High seasoning weight loss (46. 31 %) of Istrian hams was expected due to raw ham skinning. However, deboning had no influence on differences in seasoning weight loss. Significantly higher weight loss of light class hams suggest to use raw hams heavier than 10 kg and 9 kg after B and BL dressing, respectively. There was no significant press load effect on seasoning weight loss...|$|R
30|$|Due to {{the high}} age of {{specimens}} the bone quality was low and labrums were calcified, which {{made it more difficult}} to determine the border between the labrum and the acetabular bone on the CT-scans. Hereby, much of the labrum was segmented along with the bone during model-construction making the <b>pelvis</b> <b>bone</b> model less accurate in the acetabular rim region. Therefore, measurements of the CE angle are expected to be higher and {{it was not possible to}} measure the amount of bone removed from the acetabulum. Further, the inability to differentiate between the bone and the labrum made it impossible to measure bone-bone distances at impingement and determine whether the bones collided at end range FADIR. Further, the low bone quality influenced the conditions for bone removal at a consistent depth because the burr would easily penetrate into the bone in soft regions. This may have contributed to the large variation between subjects in volume of removed bone.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Our paper {{summarizes}} experiments {{for measuring}} the accuracy of deformable 2 D- 3 D registration between sets of simulated x-ray images (DRR’s) and a statistical shape model of the <b>pelvis</b> <b>bones,</b> which includes x-ray attenuation information (“density”). In many surgical scenarios, the images contain a truncated view of the pelvis anatomy. Our work specifically addresses this problem by examining different selections of truncated views as target images. Our atlas is derived by applying principal component analysis to a population of up to 110 instance shapes. The experiments measure the registration error with a large and truncated FOV. A typical accuracy of about 2 mm is achieved in the 2 D- 3 D registration, compared with about 1. 4 mm of an “optimal ” 3 D- 3 D registration. ...|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackgroundHydatid cysts {{caused by}} Echinococcus sp can produce tissue cysts {{anywhere}} in the body. Skeletal cystic lesions are rare, yet because of their unusual presentation diagnosis can be missed. Case reportWe report a case of extensive hydatidosis of the femur with pathological fracture and involvement of the <b>pelvis</b> <b>bone,</b> without involvement of abdominal viscera, in a 51 -year-old woman. The patient presented with swelling and deformity of the upper and middle third of the left thigh. The diagnosis was confirmed clinico-radiologically and the patient was treated with hindquarter amputation and chemotherapy. The patient died of sepsis and extensive bedsores one month after surgery. ConclusionsOrthopedic surgeons should be alert to this morbid condition and this disease should be suspected in cystic lesions affecting any organ {{of the body in}} pathological fractures with non-union, especially in endemic areas of the world. Early diagnosis helps in eradication and salvage of the bone; misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis are always fraught with the danger of amputation, recurrence, and sepsis...|$|E
40|$|A 16 -year-old male {{patient with}} type II {{autosomal}} dominant benign osteopetrosis (ADO) was genotyped {{and found to}} harbor a novel mutation in exon 25 of the gene encoding for the osteoclast-specific chloride channel, CLCN 7, inherited from the father, who was asymptomatic. The patient had normal biochemical findings and acid-base balance, except for increased serum levels of creatine kinase, lactic dehydrogenase, and the bone formation markers bone alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme, osteocalcin and N-terminal type I collagen telopeptide/creatinine ratio. Unusual generalized osteosclerosis was observed together with a canonical increase in vertebral and <b>pelvis</b> <b>bone</b> mass. An affected first grade cousin presented with normal biochemical findings and a milder osteosclerotic pattern of the pelvis. At the cellular level, cultured osteoclasts from the patient showed increased motility, with lamellipodia, membrane ruffling and motile pattern of podosome distribution, all of which could have contributed to functional impairment of bone resorption.

30|$|Between March 2007 and May 2012, 16 {{patients}} with advanced bladder cancer underwent a prostatocystectomy with our hybrid procedure that employs perineal and abdominal approaches at our institution. Our indications for this hybrid procedure include (i) previous pelvic operation or irradiation with resultant dense adhesions and scarring, and (ii) indication for a urethrectomy {{because of the}} possibility of carcinomatous involvement of the prostatic urethra with extension into the prostatic stroma or CIS. Preoperative staging parameters included computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging of the <b>pelvis,</b> <b>bone</b> scan, cystourethroscope, transurethral tumor biopsy, and 3 - and 9 -hour lateral verumontanum biopsy findings. All 16 patients underwent pelvic lymph node dissection during the operation. Surgical duration was measured from the time of perineal skin incision until harvesting the prostatocystectomy specimen and starting the diversion. Routine postoperative follow-up examinations were conducted at 3 -month intervals from years 1 to 5, then annually thereafter. Computed tomography, bone scan, and chest radiography examinations were scheduled for 4  months after surgery in years 1 to 2 and annually thereafter, unless otherwise clinically indicated. Local recurrence was defined as that occurring within the soft tissue field of exenteration, while distant recurrence was that occurring outside the pelvis.|$|E
