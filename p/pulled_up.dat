An inquiry determined that modifications to the windscreen had contributed to the accident but the main factor had been the pilot's handling of the highly sensitive controls. Engineers recalculated the stress factors on the airframe and they {{were found to be}} safe; the crash was attributed to pilot error and the sensitivity of the controls.|$|E

Later at around 1a.m., security guard Richard Abath returned to the front desk after patrolling the museum to switch positions with the other security guard. The two guards were the only people in the building. At this time, Abath opened and quickly shut the Palace Road door, claiming he was trained to do this to ensure the door was locked. He claimed security logs from other nights would show that he had done this many times previously. The FBI has seized the logs, but has not commented on the issue further.|$|E
5|$|At the 2006 U.S. Championships, the {{de facto}} Olympic qualifier, Lysacek was third after the short program, but <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> to win the free skate, {{finishing}} second overall.

After considering withdrawing, he decided to skate the next day and went on to skate a career-best free skate. He finished his free skate with eight triple jumps and was ranked third of the night. He finished fourth overall, seven points below the bronze. He commentated on his free-skating program on Olympic Ice the next day with Scott Hamilton and Mary Carillo.|$|E
