Each of these facilities has a permanent aluminum liner having an inside diameter of 1.584 in. (4.02 cm). The facilities are located concentric with the core on two circles of radii 15.43 in. (39.2 cm) and 17.36 in. (44.1 cm), respectively. Those located on the inner circle (11 in all) are referred to as the inner small VXFs. Those located on the outer circle (five in all) are referred to as the outer small VXFs. Normally, non-instrumented experiments are irradiated in these facilities. VXF-7 is dedicated to one of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>irradiation</b> facilities that supports the Neutron Activation Analysis Laboratory and is unavailable for other use.A pressure drop of approximately 100 psi (6.89 x 105 Pa) at full system flow is available to provide primary system coolant flow for cooling experiments. When not in use, these facilities may contain a beryllium or aluminum plug or a flow-regulating orifice and no plug.Large neutron poison loads in these facilities are of no particular concern with respect to fuel element power distribution perturbations or effects on fuel cycle length because of their distance from the core; however, experiments are carefully reviewed with respect to their neutron poison content, which is limited to minimize their effect on adjacent neutron scattering beam tubes.|$|R

There is also a health risk and a danger of exposure to radioactive material in installations that use energy sources for generation of gamma rays and other types of radiation. In general, Micro-wave and Irradiation technology was used to treat hazardous pathogenic waste before the widespread adoption of moist-heat sterilization that both autoclaves and converters use.

The probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) was performed for the plant to develop the quantified indicators of safety for various situations.

In Arabidopsis, plants deficient in chromatin remodeling are also affected in the accumulation of pigments by UV-B. Plants treated with an inhibitor of histone acetyltransferases, curcumin, previous to the UV-B treatment show deficiencies in DNA repair; in addition, the chromatin remodeling-deficient plants have altered levels of acetylated histones after the UV-B treatment, demonstrating that histone acetylation is important during DNA repair in these two plant species. Arabidopsis mutants ham 1 and ham 2 also showed increased DNA damage after UV-B, suggesting that the role of these proteins in DNA damage repair has been conserved through evolution. However, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer accumulation was higher in ham 1 than in ham 2; suggesting that HAM 1 has a major role in DNA repair after UV-B.

For distinct plant responses such as shade avoidance, far-red light or shifts in spectral light quality similarly have disparate impacts on distinct plant tissues, resulting in elongation of stems or petioles {{and a reduction in}} growth of leaf blades for many species. The physiological bases of such tissue- and organ-specific light responses were initially studied using localized irradiation of specific tissues and organs, or <b>irradiation</b> of dissected <b>plant</b> parts. These historical approaches were used to identify spatial-specific pools of photoreceptors responsible for regulating local, i. e., tissue- or organ-specific, or distal, i. e., interorgan, plant responses. The red/far-red responsive phytochromes have been the most widely studied among photoreceptors in this regard. Whereas, the spatial localization of photoreceptors regulating many tissue- or organ-specific light responses were identified, the underlying signaling networks responsible for mediating the observed responses have not been well defined.

Background. Plant {{expression}} {{systems are}} being increasingly used in scientific and industrial biotechnology. Research {{of the influence}} of different factors on efficiency of plant transient expression systems expands scientific basis for largescale and economically efficient application of these systems in industrial biotechnology. Objective. The object of this research was to determine the influence of Irradiation by blue light of plants Nicotiana benthamiana immediately before agroinfiltration on transient accumulation of reporter recombinant protein GFP. Methods. <b>Irradiation</b> of <b>plants</b> was performed using LED light sources (? = 440 nm). Quantity of accumulated reporter protein in plant leaves was measured by fluorimetric method. Results. It was demonstrated that GFP accumulation in irradiated plant biomass was higher than in not irradiated biomass. Increase of level of accumulation was between 60 ? 87 % depending on other agroinfiltration conditions. Conclusions. Shown effect seems to be promising as a methodological procedure either in labs or in industrial practices. That is because the apparatus for irradiation is constructively simple, cheap, energy efficient and a period of irradiation time is short. ????????????. ???????????? ?????????????? ??????? ??? ???? ???????????? ? ??????? ? ???????????? ?????????????. ???????????? ??????? ????????? ???????? ?? ????????????? ???????????? ???????????? ?????????????? ?????? ????????? ??????? ????? ??? ??????????? ? ???????????? ????????????? ????????????? ???? ?????? ? ?????????????????? ????????????. ???? ????????????. ??????????? ??????? ????????? ????????
