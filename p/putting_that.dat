Both hotels burned down, and a {{proposal}} by the Marriott Corporation to redevelop the area as a private resort and condominiums led to widespread opposition.

500|$|The Royal Navy's 1936 Naval Programme {{authorised}} {{the construction}} of two aircraft carriers. Admiral Sir Reginald Henderson, Third Sea Lord and Controller of the Navy, {{was determined not to}} simply modify the previous unarmoured [...] design. He believed that carriers could not be successfully defended by their own aircraft without some form of early-warning system. Lacking that, there was nothing to prevent land-based aircraft from attacking them, especially in confined waters like the North and Mediterranean Seas. This meant that the ship had to be capable of remaining in action after sustaining damage, and that her fragile aircraft had to be protected entirely from damage. The only way to do this was to completely armour the hangar in which the aircraft would shelter, but <b>putting</b> <b>that</b> much weight so high in the ship allowed only a single-storey hangar due to stability concerns. This halved the aircraft capacity of the Illustrious class compared with the older unarmoured carriers, trading offensive potential for defensive survivability.|$|E

The Stone Mountain project was initially a UDC endeavor. [...] Officials originally contemplated a monument of perhaps [...] by [...] [...] <b>Putting</b> <b>that</b> on Stone Mountain, Borglum supposedly stated, would be like putting a postage stamp on a barn. He proposed a much larger sculpture, [...] high and [...] long, and drew up plans in his Stamford, Connecticut, studio. He envisioned a huge depiction of the Confederate army, including artillery and infantry, as well as 65Confederate generals, five to be nominated by the governor of each Southern state. In 1917, the Stone Mountain Confederate Monumental Association (the Association) was founded to publicize and raise funds for a colossal sculpture at Stone Mountain. Samuel H. Venable and his family, owners of the land, agreed to deed it over for a monument, on condition that if the project was not completed in 12years, title would revert to them. [...] A formal dedication took place in May 1916; the preliminary work was interrupted by the US entry into World WarI in 1917.|$|E

2500|$|He {{elaborated}} on {{his opposition}} to the program: [...] "I think we are removing much of the burden from those that could actually help reach these objectives, particular the growth and employment objectives, and we are <b>putting</b> <b>that</b> onus strangely on ourselves rather than letting it rest where it should lie. We are too accepting of dangerous policies from others that have been long in the making, and we should put the burden on them." [...] While Federal Reserve officials routinely offer their views on non-monetary questions such as taxes, spending and regulations, it is unusual for a Federal Reserve official to suggest that monetary support should be withheld in order to compel other branches of government to enact the Federal Reserve's favored policies.|$|E

2500|$|Critic Stephanie Zacharek of Salon {{states that}} [...] "this {{adaptation}} of Cormac McCarthy's novel touches on brutal themes, but never really gets its hands dirty. The movie's violence isn't pulpy and visceral, {{the kind of}} thing that hits like a fist; it's brutal, and rather relentless, but there are still several layers of comfortable distance between it and us. At one point a character lifts his cowboy boot, daintily, so it won't be mussed by the pool of blood gathering at his feet ... The Coens have often used cruel violence to make their points– that's nothing new– but <b>putting</b> <b>that</b> violence to work in the service of allegedly deep themes isn't the same as actually getting your hands dirty. No Country for Old Men feels less like a breathing, thinking movie than an exercise. That may be partly because it's an adaptation of a book by a contemporary author who's usually spoken of in hushed, respectful, hat-in-hand tones, as if he were a schoolmarm who'd finally brought some sense and order to a lawless town." ...|$|E

The first act of the Acharya was to plant a sampling of the holy Bodhi tree from Bodh Gaya at the premises of the proposed Society. This tree has grown with the Society and is venerated. The Maha Bodhi Society Temple, a relatively new structure, was then built with the main shrine replicating the historic tower at Bodh Gaya. Temple as built is a brick structure with a central tower of [...] height. The Stupa that represents a basic factor in the teaching of the Buddha has also been built {{at the entrance to the}} temple, which is made of granite and it enshrines a relic of the Buddha. The temple, the stupa and the Bodhi tree in the temple complex now form a unique landmark in Bangalore. It is a place of worship and meditation, a centre of pilgrimage for people from all over India and other countries.|$|E
