5|$|The {{season was}} {{statistically}} {{one of the}} most dominant in the Open Era. He won 11 singles titles, which tied his 2004 season as the most in over two decades, his 81 match victories were the most since <b>Pete</b> <b>Sampras</b> in 1993, and his record of 81–4 (95.2%) remains the second-best winning percentage in the Open Era behind only John McEnroe in 1984.|$|E
5|$|Federer {{immediately}} {{turned his}} sights {{to the grass}} courts of Wimbledon, where he breezed {{his way to the}} final. In the championship match he faced long-time rival Andy Roddick in what would be their eighth and eventually final meeting at a Grand Slam. Roddick pushed Federer into a record-setting fifth set, which the Swiss claimed 16–14 to win his 15th men's singles Grand Slam singles title, breaking the all-time record of <b>Pete</b> <b>Sampras.</b>|$|E
5|$|His {{international}} breakthrough {{came at the}} 2001 Wimbledon Championships where a 19 {{year old}} Federer faced the four-time defending champion and all-time Grand Slam leader <b>Pete</b> <b>Sampras.</b> The teenage Swiss stunned the seven time Wimbledon champion and #1 seed in a dramatic five set epic to reach the quarterfinals. In the quarters he faced Englishman Tim Henman, eventually losing in an overtime fourth set tiebreaker. Federer's breakthrough at Wimbledon signaled the record breaking dominance he would display at the All England Club {{over the next two}} decades.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} {{partners}} leads the Simpson family to begin arguing and aggressively competing against one another. The tournament takes place, {{and in the}} stands, are leading tennis professionals Andre Agassi, <b>Pete</b> <b>Sampras,</b> Venus Williams, and Serena Williams. At the tournament, Homer ditches Lisa for Venus Williams. In response, Marge replaces Bart with Serena Williams as her partner. Ultimately, Serena and Venus replace Marge and Homer with Sampras and Agassi, respectively. This forces the family {{to go back to}} the bench and resume their normal places in the family. As they enjoy the exhibition of top-class tennis, they agree that it is better to watch things than to do things, and Homer offers to buy the family dinner with money he took from Sampras' wallet.|$|E
5|$|Federer's season {{turned around}} in the final masters event of the clay season when he {{defeated}} Nadal on clay {{for only the second}} time to capture the Madrid Masters. Federer entered the French Open with few predicting him to win the elusive Parisian title having lost to Nadal in the final weekend for the past four seasons. After Nadal's unexpected defeat to Robin Söderling, Federer suddenly became the overwhelming favorite. It would not be easy as in his next match as he was forced to come from two sets and break point down in the third set to defeat Tommy Haas in five sets. He was also forced to fight back from a two-sets-to-one deficit against a young Juan Martín del Potro to win a five setter in the semifinals. In the final, he faced Söderling, and with a straight sets victory, he finally captured the Coupe des Mousquetaires and career Grand Slam. This victory tied him with <b>Pete</b> <b>Sampras</b> for the most Grand Slam singles titles.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 Wimbledon Gentlemen's singles final was the {{championship}} tennis match of the Gentlemen's Singles tournament at the 2012 Wimbledon Championships. It pitted world No. 3 Roger Federer against world No. 4 Andy Murray in a Major final {{for a third}} time. This final snapped a streak of four consecutive Major finals reached by Djokovic and Nadal. Nadal was ousted {{in the second round}} while Federer defeated Djokovic in the semi-finals. In what was the most historic Major final of the year, Federer sought to win a record shattering seventeenth Major title and a record-tying seventh Wimbledon to match his idol <b>Pete</b> <b>Sampras.</b> Both of these records are amongst the most prestigious in all of tennis. Murray on the other hand had become the first British man since Bunny Austin in 1938 to reach the Wimbledon final, and was attempting to become the first Briton to win any Major title since Fred Perry in 1936.|$|E
5|$|It was lauded {{as one of}} the {{greatest}} matches ever by former players, legends, and analysts of the sport. John McEnroe claimed it surpassed the 2008 Wimbledon final as the best tennis match of all time, while legends <b>Pete</b> <b>Sampras,</b> Mats Wilander, and Björn Borg said it was the best match they saw in their lifetime. After the 2012 Australian Open, Rod Laver came out with his greatest in the amateur and Open Era lists, Djokovic was ranked 6th and Nadal 5th on the Open Era list. Laver said the 2012 Australian Open final was a main reason for including both players. Nadal called it the toughest loss of his career but the best match he ever played. Djokovic said it was the finest win in his career and also commented on the high level of tennis played. Not only was this the longest Grand Slam tournament final, but according to Tennis Channel and the Australian Open TV networks, this w{{as one of the}} most-watched finals, despite ending late into the night locally. Soon after the conclusion of the 2012 Australian Open, there were sources claiming that Djokovic sealed his spot as a tennis great and in the Tennis Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Nadal {{defeated}} Federer in 5 sets in 4 {{hours and}} 19 minutes, with the match finishing after midnight, {{to become the}} first Spaniard to win the Australian Open. The match was lauded {{as one of the greatest}} ever at the Australian Open and it was yet another high quality match between two of the greatest players of all time, only 6 months since their epic 2008 Wimbledon final. It was a match of huge significance as had Federer won the match he would have equalled the all-time Grand Slam tournament record of 14 by <b>Pete</b> <b>Sampras</b> and the open-era record for most Australian Open titles of 4 with Andre Agassi (he would go on to achieve these in the near future). However, as a result of Nadal winning he set his own records, holding 3 of the 4 slams at the same time for the first time in his career. Not only that but he became the first man in the open-era to hold 3 Grand Slam tournament titles on 3 different surfaces at the same time. This victory over Federer many believed brought about a change in the tennis standings as Nadal was now clearly the number 1 player after Federer had that title for over 4 and a half years consecutively with Nadal deemed the second best for nearly 3 years of that. The defeat brought Federer to tears as he came to terms with his loss.|$|E
5|$|The doubles team of Paes and Bhupathi grew {{stronger}} in 1998, reaching the semifinals of three Grand Slams, the Australian Open, the French Open, and the US Open. In the same year, Paes had {{two of his}} biggest singles results in the ATP tour. The first one came by winning his only ATP singles title at Newport, and the second was beating <b>Pete</b> <b>Sampras,</b> 6–3, 6–4, at the New Haven ATP tournament in the only meeting in their career. In 1999, the duo reached the finals of all four Grand Slams, winning Wimbledon and the French Open, thus becoming the first Indian pair to win a doubles event at a Grand Slam. Paes also teamed up with Lisa Raymond to win the mixed doubles event at Wimbledon. The year also marked his ascent to the no. 1 ranking in doubles. The following year, Paes partnered with Sébastien Lareau for the Australian Open and Jan Siemerink for the French Open, losing {{in the first round}} on both occasions. Paes teamed up again with Bhupathi for the US Open, but lost in the first round again. The duo had a disappointing second round exit to Australian duo of Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde at the Sydney Olympics, despite high hopes. Paes was given the honour of carrying the Indian Flag at the opening ceremony of the Sydney Olympics. In spite of a winning the French Open in 2001, the team of Bhupathi and Paes had first-round exits in the other three Grand Slams. Paes was awarded the Padmashri by the Government of India in 2001. The duo of Paes and Bhupathi won the gold medal at the 2002 Asian Games in Busan. In 2002, Leander paired up with Michael Hill for a number of tournaments, with moderate success.|$|E

25|$|In 1998, Agassi began a {{rigorous}} conditioning program and {{worked his way}} back up the rankings by playing in Challenger Series tournaments, a circuit for pro players ranked outside the world's top 50. After returning to top physical and mental shape, Agassi recorded the most successful period of his tennis career and also played classic matches in that period against <b>Pete</b> <b>Sampras</b> and Patrick Rafter.|$|E
25|$|Johnson {{was born}} and raised in Townsville, Queensland. His first {{sporting}} love was tennis with his idol being <b>Pete</b> <b>Sampras.</b> At 14 he was offered the opportunity to move to Brisbane to further his tennis career but turned it down. It wasn't until the age of 17 that Johnson gave up on his childhood dream of being a professional tennis player and began focusing on cricket.|$|E
25|$|Later that year, McEnroe {{reached the}} semifinals of the US Open, {{losing to the}} {{eventual}} champion, <b>Pete</b> <b>Sampras</b> in four sets. He also won the Davidoff Swiss Indoors in Basel, defeating Goran Ivanišević in a five-set final. The last time McEnroe was ranked in the world top ten was on October 22, 1990, when he was ranked 9th. His end-of-year singles ranking was 13th.|$|E
25|$|His next tournament was the Stockholm Open. He got a bye in {{the first}} round, {{defeated}} the American Taylor Dent in the next round, and defeated fellow Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka afterwards. Up next in the semifinals was Ivan Ljubičić, whom Federer beat in two sets. Federer won his 64th Tour-level title, tying with <b>Pete</b> <b>Sampras</b> for fourth place on the Open Era titles list, as he beat Florian Mayer in the final to win his first Stockholm crown.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, Agassi won {{the only}} doubles {{title of his}} career, at the Cincinnati Masters, partnered with Petr Korda. He missed much of {{the early part of}} that year due to injuries. Although he made the quarterfinals in his Wimbledon title defense, he lost to {{eventual}} champion and world no. 1 <b>Pete</b> <b>Sampras</b> in five sets. Agassi lost in the first round at the US Open to Thomas Enqvist and required wrist surgery late in the year.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, {{at the age}} of 19, he was the {{youngest}} player in the year-end top 50. In 1996, he reached the 4th round of the Australian Open upsetting <b>Pete</b> <b>Sampras</b> in the 3rd round and in doubles with Patrick Rafter. On 25 May 1997, he recorded a personal best 229.0km/h (142.3mph) serve in a game he lost to Albert Costa. During the height of his career, Mark was known as having one of the fastest serves in the game.|$|E
25|$|In 1951, {{at the age}} of 24, he won {{both the}} Australian and Wimbledon men's singles championships. Savitt was mostly ranked World No. 2 the same year behind fellow amateur Frank Sedgman, though was {{declared}} World No. 1 by The New York Times and The Owosso Argus-Press following his Wimbledon victory. He retired the following year. Savitt is one of four American men who have won both the Australian and British Championships in one year, following Don Budge (1938) and preceding Jimmy Connors (1974) and <b>Pete</b> <b>Sampras</b> (1994 & 1997).|$|E
25|$|In February 1996, Muster {{attained}} {{the world}} no. 1 ranking {{for the first}} time. He held the ranking initially for just one week, and then regained it for five weeks over March and April 1996. The validity of Muster's number one ranking was called into question by top Americans <b>Pete</b> <b>Sampras</b> and Andre Agassi, who argued that he had achieved the top spot based almost solely on his clay court results, although Muster had beaten Sampras on indoor carpet at the 1995 Masters event in Germany, and Agassi had only won tournaments on hardcourt in 1995.|$|E
25|$|During {{the open}} era, first Rod Laver and more {{recently}} Björn Borg and <b>Pete</b> <b>Sampras</b> were regarded by many of their contemporaries as among the greatest ever. Andre Agassi, {{the first of two}} male players in history to have achieved a Career Golden Slam in singles tennis (followed by Rafael Nadal), has been called the best service returner {{in the history of the}} game. He is the first man to win slams on all modern surfaces (previous holders of all slams played in an era of grass and clay only), and is regarded by a number of critics and fellow players to be among the greatest players of all time.|$|E
25|$|Safin {{began his}} {{professional}} tennis career in 1997, {{and held the}} No. 1 world ranking {{for a total of}} 9 weeks between November 2000 and April 2001. He won his first Grand Slam title at the 2000 US Open, defeating <b>Pete</b> <b>Sampras,</b> and won the 2005 Australian Open, defeating Australian Lleyton Hewitt in the final. Safin helped lead Russia to Davis Cup victories in 2002 and 2006. Despite his dislike of grass courts, he became the first Russian man to reach the semifinals of Wimbledon at the 2008 Wimbledon Championships. At the time of his retirement in November 2009, he was ranked No. 61 in the world.|$|E
25|$|For about 14 {{years from}} around 1920 to 1934, Bill Tilden was {{generally}} considered the greatest player of all time. From 1934 through 1967, during the Golden Age of Tennis, when Vines, Perry, Budge, Riggs, Kramer, Gonzales, Segura, Sedgman, Trabert, Hoad, Rosewall, and Laver were {{the top tier}} players, Gonzales was considered the best of this period. Since 1968, with the first Grand Slam of the Open Era at the French Open, Champions such as Rod Laver, Jimmy Connors, Björn Borg, John McEnroe, <b>Pete</b> <b>Sampras,</b> Rafael Nadal, and Roger Federer have been considered by their contemporaries to be greater players than Tilden or Gonzales.|$|E
25|$|Chang {{was a key}} {{member of}} the US team which won the Davis Cup in 1990. In the semifinals at Austria, his {{dramatic}} comeback from two-sets down against Horst Skoff, 3–6, 6–7, 6–4, 6–4, 6–3, led the US into its first Davis Cup final since 1984. Chang went on to defeat Darren Cahill in straight sets, as the US defeated Australia in the final. He was also on the US team which won the World Team Cup in 1993. His best performance in the year-end singles championship came in 1995, when he defeated Muster, Jim Courier, and then dominated <b>Pete</b> <b>Sampras</b> in the semifinals, before losing in the final to Boris Becker.|$|E
25|$|Oversize {{and larger}} racquets are {{generally}} used by older recreational players, {{as a way}} to reduce the impact of aging on their tennis competitiveness. The largest legal racquets, which are known as super-oversize frames, have proven extremely rare in professional competition, with only Monica Seles being a top 10 or higher ranked player who used one (a 125 square inch Yonex) during her career at any time. Andre Agassi achieved considerable success with an oversize racquet, a fact that was often noted due to his rivalry with <b>Pete</b> <b>Sampras,</b> a player who used a much smaller midsize frame. Oversize racquets are generally considered to offer more power but less control, a trend that exists from the smallest racquet size ("standard") to the largest legal size, which is 135 square inches.|$|E
25|$|Federer {{entered the}} match {{attempting}} {{to win his}} thirteenth Grand Slam title and a record fifth consecutive in New York, while the 21-year-old Murray had reached the finals of a Slam {{for the first time}} in his career. Federer came roaring out of the gates and comfortably secured the first set. The Swiss continued his dominance by achieving an early break in the second before Murray broke back to get back on serve. Federer would save three break points in the second set and eventually take the set. Federer would run away with the final set, sealing his victory with a pair of overhead smashes. This title pulled Federer within one of the all-time record of 14 majors held by <b>Pete</b> <b>Sampras.</b> Federer's victory also made him the only man to win five consecutive titles at two different majors (Wimbledon 2003-2007 and US Open 2004-2008).|$|E
25|$|In March in Miami, in {{the first}} round Roddick had his first ATP level victory as he beat World No. 41 Fernando Vicente of Spain, 6–4, 6–0. In August in Washington, D.C., he beat World No. 30 Fabrice Santoro of France, 4–6, 6–3, 6–3. Roddick played the Banana Bowl in the city of São Paulo and won, beating Joachim Johansson in the final. Roddick also won the Australian Junior Open, {{defeating}} Mario Ančić in the final. In 2001, Roddick defeated former French Open champion Michael Chang in five sets {{in the second round of}} the tournament, despite the fact that clay was Roddick's worst surface. During the following Wimbledon, he further showed potential by taking a set from eventual winner Goran Ivanišević. At the age of 18, he also defeated 7-time Wimbledon champion, World No. 4, and fellow American <b>Pete</b> <b>Sampras</b> at the Miami Masters 7–6, 6–3, and World No. 1 Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil, 6–7, 6–4, 6–2, in August.|$|E
25|$|Chang met Edberg in {{the semifinals}} of the US Open in 1992, this time Edberg winning in a five-set encounter, 6–7, 7–5, 7–6, 5–7, 6–4. The 5-hour, 26-minute match is the longest in US Open history. Chang reached three further Grand Slam finals after his 1989 French Open triumph, losing the 1995 French Open final to Thomas Muster, the 1996 Australian Open final to Boris Becker, and the 1996 US Open final to <b>Pete</b> <b>Sampras.</b> In the 1995 French Open, he {{defeated}} Michael Stich and then two-time defending champion Sergi Bruguera {{in the semifinals}} in straight sets, eventually losing to Muster. In both the 1996 Australian and U.S. Opens, he defeated Andre Agassi in the semifinals in straight sets; a win over Sampras at the U.S. Open would have made Chang the no. 1 player in the world. In the 1997 U.S. Open, he was the odds-on favorite to win after Sampras was upset by Petr Korda; however, Chang lost to eventual champion Patrick Rafter in the semifinals in straight sets.|$|E
25|$|He then {{dominated}} the spring clay court season. He won 24 consecutive singles matches, which broke Andre Agassi's Open Era record of consecutive match wins {{for a male}} teenager. Nadal won the Torneo Conde de Godó in Barcelona and beat 2004 French Open runner-up Guillermo Coria in the finals of the 2005 Monte Carlo Masters and the 2005 Rome Masters. These victories raised his ranking to world No. 5 and {{made him one of}} the favorites at his career-first French Open. On his 19th birthday, Nadal defeated Federer in the 2005 French Open semifinals, being one of only four players who defeated the top-seeded player that year (along with Marat Safin, Richard Gasquet, and David Nalbandian). Two days later, he defeated Mariano Puerta in the final, becoming the second male player after Mats Wilander to win the French Open on his first attempt. He also became the first teenager to win a Grand Slam singles title since <b>Pete</b> <b>Sampras</b> won the 1990 US Open at age 19. Winning the French Open improved Nadal's ranking to world No. 3.|$|E
