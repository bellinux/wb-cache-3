40|$|Styrene readily polymerizes to {{polystyrene}} by {{a relatively}} conventional free radical chain mechanism. Either heat or initiators will begin the <b>polymerization.</b> <b>Initiators</b> thermally decompose, thereby forming active free radicals that {{are effective in}} starting the <b>polymerization</b> process. Typically <b>initiators</b> used in the suspension process include benzoyl peroxide and di-tert-butyl per-benzoate. Potassium persulfate is a typical initiator used in emulsion polymerizations. In the presence of inert materials, styrene monomer will react with itself to form a homopolymer. Styrene monomer will react {{with a variety of}} other monomers to form a number of copolymers. Polystyrene is an odorless, tasteless, rigid thermoplastic. Pure polystyrene has the following structure. The homopolymers of styrene are also referred to as general purpose, or crystal, polystyrene. Because of the brittleness of crystal polystyrene, styrene is frequently polymerized in the presence of dissolved polybutadiene rubber to improve the strength of the polymer. Such modified polystyrene is called high-impact, or rubber-modified, polystyrene. The styrene content of high-impact polystyrene varies from about 88 to 97 percent.

Later on, in 1949 Dickey reported the polymerization of sodium silicate in the presence of four different dyes (namely methyl, ethyl, n-propyl and n-butyl orange). The dyes were subsequently removed, and in rebinding experiments it was found that silica prepared in the presence of any of these [...] "pattern molecules" [...] would bind the pattern molecule in preference to the other three dyes. Shortly after this work had appeared, several research groups pursued the preparation of specific adsorbents using Dickey's method. Some commercial interest was also shown by the fact that Merck patented a nicotine filter, consisting of nicotine imprinted silica, able to adsorb 10.7% more nicotine than non-imprinted silica.

"Single" polymerization, "multiple"polymerization (four or eight reactions at the same time), and time-dependent studies are described. Single <b>polymerizations</b> using constant <b>initiator</b> concentrations resulted in a broad scattering of nonreproducible molecular weight values. Multiple <b>polymerizations</b> at constant <b>initiator</b> concentrations, however, resulted in nearly identical molecular weight profiles.

Both the single and multiple melt polymerizations resulted in rather broad molecular weight distributions. The presence of hydrolysis products of lactide during the melt polymerization most likely has a detrimental effect on molecular weight. After a short induction period the rather slow polymerization of D,L-lactide resulted in a maximal molecular weight followed by a slight decrease in molecular weight to a constant value.

Using this process, {{we were able to}} invert the charge in a continuous manner without losing colloidal stability upon passing the isoelectric point. The straightforward reaction mechanism together {{with the fact that the}} reaction could be quenched rapidly resulted in a colloidal system in which the zeta potential can be tuned between - 80 and 45 mV.

Graphite has a lamellar structure, with an interlayer distance of 0. 335 nm. Besides the large number of reagents that can be intercalated, a number of different types of graphites are used. The most commonly used potassium–graphite intercalation compound, C 8 K, shows an interlayer distance of 5. 34 A, and all carbon layers are separated by a layer of K. Differences among the alkali metals in behavior toward graphite have been explained in terms of electron transfer. Pure yellow, first-stage compounds of Ba and Sr with graphite were prepared by the direct action of metal vapor on graphite in metallic tubes sealed under vacuum.
