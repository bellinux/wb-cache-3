We will present the basic ideas behind three of these applications: that of linear <b>programming</b> <b>to</b> probabilistic logic, that of nonlinear <b>programming</b> <b>to</b> Bayesian logic, and that of integer <b>programming</b> <b>to</b> Dempster-Shafer theory. A mathematical programming approach not only provides a practical means of computing inferences, as in probabilistic logic and Dempster-Shafer theory, but it can suggest new types of logic for dealing with uncertainty, as in the cas [...] ...|$|R

5|$|A local landmark, the Fremont Troll—a large cement {{sculpture}} of a troll clutching a real-life Volkswagen Beetle—was installed under the bridge's north end in 1990. Up to half of the $40,000 cost for the artwork was donated from Seattle's Neighborhood Matching Fund, a local <b>program</b> <b>to</b> raise money for community projects. The sculpture was heavily vandalized in the year following its construction and large floodlights were installed on the bridge to discourage further damage.|$|E
