40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{define a}} risk profile for <b>post-transfusion</b> <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> in {{patients}} receiving massive transfusion. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Hepatitis C {{accounts for more}} than 90 % of post-transfusion hepatitis. METHODS: Two-hundred twenty-one of 8, 765 consecutive trauma admissions to a Level I trauma center received more than 20 units of erythrocytes. Sixty-nine survivors had positive viral serologic tests at least 1 year after transfusion. Surrogate testing for hepatitis C using alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (Core) began in October 1986 and January 1987, respectively. Donor blood for group 1 (pre-ALT/Core) was transfused before surrogate screening was introduced. Donor blood for group 2 (post-ALT/Core) was transfused after surrogate screening. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients received blood products from 4, 987 donors (mean, 72. 3 units of exposure). No patient tested positive for antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen, human immunodeficiency virus, or human T-lymphotrophic virus type 1. However 23. 2 % tested positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) as measured by a second-generation enzyme immunoassay (HCV 2. 0) and a recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA), and 21. 7 % tested positive by HCV 1. 0. Antibodies to Core were found in 8. 7 % of patients. The risk for <b>post-transfusion</b> <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> per unit of exposure is estimated to be 1. 52 % group 1 (pre-ALT/Core) and 0. 239 % for group 2 (post-ALT/Core). CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of ALT/Core donor screening by a blood bank reduced the incidence of <b>post-transfusion</b> <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> by 84 %. The risk for <b>post-transfusion</b> <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> depends on units of exposure, screening techniques, and prevalence of hepatitis C in the donor population. In our community, the risk for <b>post-transfusion</b> <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> is less than 0. 2 % per unit of exposure. The population of massively transfused patients may serve as our effective resource for monitoring the safety of the blood supply...|$|E

After a total mean 31 months of follow up in 23 patients, nine (six treated, three controls) had self limited disease while 14 (five treated, nine controls) developed chronic liver disease; all patients with spontaneous or self limited hepatitis C (HCV) infection maintained normal serum alanine amino-transferase activity and absence of HCV-RNA, and tended to lose anti-HCV antibodies...|$|E
40|$|The Blood Transfusion Service {{introduced}} {{screening for}} Hepatitis C antibody (HCV) in September 1991.

In this way we prevented the blood donor from spreading the virus via subsequent blood donations. There were some interesting discrepancies in the HCV assays. Blood samples, when tested by different methods, gave both positive and negative results. The results also varied according to when the blood samples to be tested were taken.

40|$|Because the {{majority}} of patients with chronic <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> {{do not respond to}} interferon, alternative treat-ments need to be established. Several lines of evidence suggest that iron depletion is beneficial for such patients. Thus, gastrectomized patients with a reduced capacity for iron absorption might have an advantage in treatment of their liver damage over patients with intact gastrointestinal tracts. Four male gastrectomized patients had <b>post-transfusion</b> chronic <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C.</b> The iron load in three patients was adjusted below 10 ng/ml of serum ferritin level by phlebotomy. Subsequent interferon treat-ment for the four patients without iron load cleared circulating <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus RNA in one patient only. However, serum ferritin concentrations were stabilized at low levels without maintenance phlebotomy, and sustained normalization of serum liver enzyme activities was obtained in all four patients. Similar treatments were done for 10 male patients with intact gastrointestinal tracts. The amount of removed iron from these patients was more than that from gastrectomized patients. Interferon also failed to clear circulating <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus RNA except in one case. Low ferritin levels and sustained normalization of liver enzymes were seen in three patients. A transient elevation of ferritin levels with low enzyme activities was seen in two patients. Relapsing hepatitis was seen in five of the seven patients who needed maintenance phlebotomy due to a rebound in serum ferritin levels, probably because of active iron absorption from the intestine.

40|$|Acute {{hepatitis}} B is a self limiting {{disease that}} resolves spontaneously in 95 % {{of patients who}} acquire the infection in adulthood. Patients with acute hepatitis B, however, usually take between four and 12 weeks to recover; the personal, social, and sanitary costs associated with this are high. Also, 5 - 10 % of patients with acute hepatitis B go on to develop chronic liver disease. Hepatitis C, by comparison, is an asymptomatic disease associated with a high progression to the chronic stage. At least 50 % of patients with <b>post-transfusion</b> <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> develop chronic liver disease or cirrhosis. While the efficacy of alpha interferon in chronic hepatitis B and C is now well established, only preliminary evidence {{for use in the}} acute phase exists.

40|$|The {{identification}} of a specific immunogenic candidate that will effectively activate the appropriate pathway for neutralizing antibody production is fundamental for vaccine design. By using a monoclonal antibody (1 H 8) that neutralizes HCV in vitro, we have demonstrated here that 1 H 8 recognized an epitope mapped between residues A 524 and W 529 of the E 2 protein. We {{also found that the}} epitope residues A 524, P 525, Y 527 and W 529 were crucial for antibody binding, while the residues T 526, Y 527 and W 529 within the same epitope engaged in the interaction with the host entry factor CD 81. Furthermore, we detected " 1 H 8 -like" antibodies, defined as those with amino acid-specificity similar to 1 H 8, in the plasma of patients with chronic HCV infection. The time course study of plasma samples from Patient H, a well-characterized case of <b>post-transfusion</b> <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C,</b> showed that " 1 H 8 -like" antibodies could be detected in a sample collected almost two years after the initial infection, thus confirming the immunogenicity of this epitope in vivo. The characterization of this neutralization epitope with a function in host entry factor CD 81 interaction should enhance our understanding of antibody-mediated neutralization of HCV infections...|$|E

Estes foram divididos em 2 grupos com cirrose (n = 92) e sem cirrose (n = 83). O tempo médio de desenvolvimento de cirrose foi de 11 ± 6 anos. Pacientes com cirrose eram mais velhos à época da transfusão, apresentavam maior prevalência de alcoolismo e tinham tempo de evolução mais longo. O prognóstico foi pior no grupo com cirrose com 28, 4 % de mortalidade e 9, 1 % de carcinoma hepatocelular, comparados a 5, 5 % e 0 % no grupo sem cirrose, respectivamente.

40|$|Although the {{population}} prevalence of hepatitis C in Canada is not known, stud-ies in defined populations have provided {{some information about}} the epidemiology of hepatitis C. In the United States, preva-lence in blood donors is between 0. 3 and 0. 7 %, 1 and is probably slightly higher in the unscreened general population. 2 - 3 For Canada, recent figures indicate that about 0. 04 % of blood donors are anti-HCV pos-itive {{at the time of}} screening. 4 The major route of transmission for hepatitis C is parenteral, with injection drug use being the most significant risk factor for infection. 1, 2, 5, 6 For Canadian populations, estimates of seroprevalence in injection drug users range from 45 to 52 %, and in prison populations, from 27 to 39 %. 7 - 11 Receipt of blood or blood products not screened for hepatitis C antibody is a well-documented risk factor. 6 The risk of trans-fusion-associated hepatitis C infection in Canada has declined since 1983; prior to the introduction of any screening for hepatitis C, about 4. 5 % of transfusion recipients became infected. With the intro-duction of specific anti-HCV testing, the incidence of <b>post-transfusion</b> <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> fell to 1. 1 %, and has continued to decline. 12 A recent survey of Canadian hemophiliacs indicates an overall sero-prevalence of 63 %. 13 Preliminary findings from the Sentinel Health Unit Surveillance System (SHUSS) have provided additional information on the risk factors for hepatitis C infection in the Canadian population. SHUSS is a net-work of Canadian health units, represent-ing a mix of urban and rural communities and including about 10 % of the Canadian population.

This study identified <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> genotypes in pediatric and adolescent thalassemic {{patients and their}} correlation with age, blood transfusion, HCV RNA viral titer and liver function. Methods: This study considers cross-sectional data from the Center for Thalassemia in Zahedan (Iran) carried out between August 2005 and September 2007. Twenty multitransfused patients suffering from β-thalassemia major and chronic HCV infection (13 males, 7 females) {{were included in the}} study. Patients were considered eligible for the study if they were seropositive for HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) before initiation of evaluation. Blood sample was taken for HCV genotype and viral titer as well as biochemical markers. Type specific primer and real-time RT-PCR HCV were used for determination of viral genotype and HCV-RNA titer. Findings: There was a significant positive correlation between serum HCV RNA titer and genotypes (P< 0001). Serum HCV RNA levels were found higher in genotype 3 a than in others. The most prevalent genotype in thalassemic patients was genotype 3 a (40 %) followed by 1 b (25 %), unclassified (20 %) and la (15 %). There was no meaningful relationship between genotype, Alanine aminotranferease, ferritin and alkaline phosphatase. Age, serum HCV RNA titer and number of transfusions were the only significant factors associated with genotypes (P< 015, P< 0. 0001 and P< 0. 001 respectively). Conclusion: This study showed that HCV genotype and viral titer are related to the number of blood transfusions received by thalassemic patients.

Methods: This study was conducted to assess the patients with beta-thalassemia in Isfahan hospitals during 1996 - 2011 for HCV infection. A structured interview questionnaire was developed by the trained researcher to collect the demographic and risk factors. Statistical analysis was done by Chi-square test, Mann-Withney and multiple logistic regressions using SPSS software, version 15. Results: 466 patients with major thalassemia participated in this study. The mean age of patients was 17. 46 ± 8. 3. Two hundred and seventy (58. 3 %) and 193 (41. 7 %) of participants were male and female, respectively. The prevalence of HCV was estimated 8 % among thalassemia patients. History of surgery, history of dental procedure, number of units transfused per month, number of transfusion per month and duration of transfusion had significant association with HCV seropositivity in univariate analysis. There were no statistical significant risk factors for HCV seropositivity in multiple logistic regression models.

PTH-NANB patients received 151 blood product transfusions and control patients 140. 4 of 9 PTH-NANB patients (3 / 5 chronic, 1 / 4 acute resolved hepatitis) and 0 / 9 controls seroconverted. 7 of the transfusions given to PTH-NANB patients but none of those given to control patients were anti-HCV positive. In 7 of 9 serum sets from PTH-NANB index cases plus implicated donors, either a donor or the recipient was anti-HCV positive. Among the donors implicated in transmission of PTH-NANB there was a strong correlation between raised alanine aminotransferase levels and the presence of anti-HCV antibodie...|$|R

The assessment of 70 224 blood donations in three regions showed that E. H. A. I. detected more antigen-positive blood donations than C. E. P. Results of retesting more than 100 blood donors implicated in 10 cases of <b>post-transfusion</b> <b>hepatitis</b> suggested that the use of E. H. A.

40|$|Objective:Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an {{etiological}} agent {{responsible for}} occurrence of <b>post-transfusion</b> <b>hepatitis</b> in thalassemic patients. This study identified <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> genotypes in pediatric and adolescent thalassemic {{patients and their}} correlation with age, blood transfusion, HCV RNA viral titer and liver function. Methods:This study considers cross-sectional data from the Center for Thalassemia in Zahedan (Iran) carried out between August 2005 and September 2007. Twenty multitransfused patients suffering from ?-thalassemia major and chronic HCV infection (13 males, 7 females) {{were included in the}} study. Patients were considered eligible for the study if they were seropositive for HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) before initiation of evaluation. Blood sample was taken for HCV genotype and viral titer as well as biochemical markers. Type specific primer and real-time RT-PCR HCV were used for determination of viral genotype and HCV-RNA titer. Findings:There was a significant positive correlation between serum HCV RNA titer and genotypes (P< 0001). Serum HCV RNA levels were found higher in genotype 3 a than in others. The most prevalent genotype in thalassemic patients was genotype 3 a (40 %) followed by 1 b (25 %), unclassified (20 %) and la (15 %). There was no meaningful relationship between genotype, Alanine aminotranferease, ferritin and alkaline phosphatase. Age, serum HCV RNA titer and number of transfusions were the only significant factors associated with genotypes (P< 015, P< 0. 0001 and P< 0. 001 respectively). Conclusion:This study showed that HCV genotype and viral titer are related to the number of blood transfusions received by thalassemic patients. Screening donated blood in blood banks would prevent the occurrence of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> in this high-risk group...|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-1970s, Harvey J. Alter, Chief of the Infectious Disease Section in the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the National Institutes of Health, and his {{research}} team demonstrated how most <b>post-transfusion</b> <b>hepatitis</b> cases were {{not due to}} hepatitis A or B viruses. Despite this discovery, international research efforts to identify the virus, initially called non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH), failed for the next decade. In 1987, Michael Houghton, Qui-Lim Choo, and George Kuo at Chiron Corporation, collaborating with Daniel W. Bradley at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, used a novel molecular cloning approach to identify the unknown organism and develop a diagnostic test. In 1988, Alter confirmed the virus by verifying its presence in a panel of NANBH specimens. In April 1989, the discovery of HCV was published in two articles in the journal Science. The discovery led to significant improvements in diagnosis and improved antiviral treatment. In 2000, Drs. Alter and Houghton were honored with the Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research for [...] "pioneering work leading {{to the discovery of}} the virus that causes <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> and the development of screening methods that reduced the risk of blood transfusion-associated hepatitis in the U.S. from 30% in 1970 to virtually zero in 2000." ...|$|R

40|$|Patients with decompensated liver {{cirrhosis}} (n 1441) {{and those with}} <b>post-transfusion</b> <b>hepatitis</b> (n 343), whose medical expenses were subsidized by the Aichi Prefectural Government, were followed up for three years by record linkage with the Aichi Cancer Registry. During the follow-up period, 122 incident cases of liver cancer were identified. Compared with the general popu-lation, patients with decompensated {{liver cirrhosis}} were at a 64. 9 times greter risk (50. 5 times in males and 100. 4 times in females) and those with <b>post-transfusion</b> <b>hepatitis</b> were at a 9. 4 times greater risk (8. 9 times in males and 13. 7 times in females) of developing liver cancer. In-formation on prognostic factors for 1, 068 patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis was also collected in a questionnaire survey by the physicians in charge. Patients positive to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs Ag) and those positive to HBe Ag had a significantly increased risk of sub-sequent liver cancer. The risk of developing liver cancer was positively associated with base-line levels of GPT and AFP and age and, inversely associated with total alcohol intake and female sex. In multivariate analyses, the associations with HBe Ag, AFP, sex and age remained statistically significant, whereas the associations with GPT, total alcohol intake and HBs Ag were of borderline significance...|$|R
40|$|AbstractResponse-guided {{therapy is}} of limited use in {{developing}} countries because <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus RNA detection by sensitive molecular methods is time- and labor-consuming and expensive. We evaluated early predictive efficacy of serum <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus core antigen kinetics on sustained virologic response in patients with genotype 1 <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus during pegylated interferon plus ribavirin treatment. For 478 patients recruited, <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus RNAs were detected at baseline, and at weeks 4, 12, 24, 48, and 72 using Cobas TaqMan. Architect <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus core antigen was performed at baseline, and weeks 4 and 12. Predictive values of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus core antigen on sustained virologic response were compared to <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus RNA. In the first 12 weeks after treatment initiation the dynamic patterns of serum <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus core antigen and <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus RNA levels were similar in sustained virologic response, relapse, and null response patients groups. Although areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus core antigen were {{lower than those of}} <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus RNA at the same time points, modeling analysis showed that undetectable <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus core antigen (rapid virological response based on <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus core antigen) had similar positive predictive value on sustained virologic response to <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus RNA at week 4 (90. 4 % vs 93. 3 %), and <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus core antigen decrease greater than 1 log 10 IU/mL (early virological response based on <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus core antigen) had similar negative predictive value to <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus RNA at week 12 (94. 1 % vs 95. 2 %). Analysis on the validation group demonstrated a positive predictivevalue of 97. 5 % in rapid virological response based on <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus core antigen and a negative predictive value of 100 % in early virological response based on <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus core antigen. In conclusion, <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus core antigen is comparable to <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus RNA in predicting sustained virologic response of chronic genotype 1 <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus infected patients, and can be used to guide anti-hepatitis C virus treatment, especially in resource-limited areas...|$|R
