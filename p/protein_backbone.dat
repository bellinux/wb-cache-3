5|$|The {{amino acids}} in a {{polypeptide}} chain are linked by peptide bonds. Once linked in the protein chain, an individual amino acid {{is called a}} residue, and the linked series of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms are known as the main chain or <b>protein</b> <b>backbone.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because protein {{structures}} {{are composed of}} amino acids whose side chains are linked by a common <b>protein</b> <b>backbone,</b> {{a number of different}} possible subsets of the atoms that make up a protein macromolecule can be used in producing a structural alignment and calculating the corresponding RMSD values. When aligning structures with very different sequences, the side chain atoms generally are not taken into account because their identities differ between many aligned residues. For this reason it is common for structural alignment methods to use by default only the backbone atoms included in the peptide bond. For simplicity and efficiency, often only the alpha carbon positions are considered, since the peptide bond has a minimally variant planar conformation. Only when the structures to be aligned are highly similar or even identical is it meaningful to align side-chain atom positions, in which case the RMSD reflects not only the conformation of the <b>protein</b> <b>backbone</b> but also the rotameric states of the side chains. Other comparison criteria that reduce noise and bolster positive matches include secondary structure assignment, native contact maps or residue interaction patterns, measures of side chain packing, and measures of hydrogen bond retention.|$|E
5|$|The {{peptide bond}} has two {{resonance}} forms that contribute some double-bond character and inhibit rotation around its axis, {{so that the}} alpha carbons are roughly coplanar. The other two dihedral angles in the peptide bond determine the local shape assumed by the <b>protein</b> <b>backbone.</b> The end with a free amino group {{is known as the}} N-terminus or amino terminus, whereas the end of the protein with a free carboxyl group is known as the C-terminus or carboxy terminus (the sequence of the protein is written from N-terminus to C-terminus, from left to right).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Molecular Distance Geometry Problem (MDGP) is {{the problem}} of finding the {{conformation}} of a molecule from inter-atomic distances. In some recent work, we proposed the interval Branch & Prune (iBP) algorithm for solving instances of the MDGP related to <b>protein</b> <b>backbones.</b> This algorithm is based on an artificial ordering given to the atoms of the <b>protein</b> <b>backbones</b> which allows the discretization of the problem, and hence the applicability of the iBP algorithm. This algorithm explores a discrete search domain having the structure of a tree and prunes its infeasible branches by employing suitable pruning devices. In this work, we use information derived from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) to conceive and add new pruning devices to the iBP algorithm, and we study their influence on the performances of the algorithm. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{most common}} current {{homology}} modeling method takes its inspiration from calculations required {{to construct a}} three-dimensional structure from data generated by NMR spectroscopy. One or more target-template alignments are used to construct a set of geometrical criteria that are then converted to probability density functions for each restraint. Restraints applied to the main protein internal coordinates – <b>protein</b> <b>backbone</b> distances and dihedral angles – {{serve as the basis}} for a global optimization procedure that originally used conjugate gradient energy minimization to iteratively refine the positions of all heavy atoms in the protein.|$|E
25|$|The {{assessment}} of homology models' accuracy is straightforward when the experimental structure is known. The most common method of comparing two protein structures uses the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) metric {{to measure the}} mean distance between the corresponding atoms in the two structures {{after they have been}} superimposed. However, RMSD does underestimate the accuracy of models in which the core is essentially correctly modeled, but some flexible loop regions are inaccurate. A method introduced for the modeling assessment experiment CASP is known as the global distance test (GDT) and measures the total number of atoms whose distance from the model to the experimental structure lies under a certain distance cutoff. Both methods can be used for any subset of atoms in the structure, but are often applied to only the alpha carbon or <b>protein</b> <b>backbone</b> atoms to minimize the noise created by poorly modeled side chain rotameric states, which most modeling methods are not optimized to predict.|$|E
500|$|With Jay Ponder in 1987, {{as part of}} an {{exploration}} of using internal packing of sidechains to enumerate the possible sequences compatible with a given <b>protein</b> <b>backbone</b> structure (a foreshadowing of protein engineering and design), Richards developed the first side-chain rotamer library. (...) Increasingly detailed rotamer libraries have been made since then by other research groups, with some used primarily for structure validation and others for homology modeling or protein design.|$|E
40|$|Arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs) are a {{class of}} {{proteoglycans}} found in cell secretions and plasma membranes of plants. Attention is currently focused on their structure and their potential role in growth and development. We present evidence that two members of a major class of AGPs, the classical AGPs, AGPNa 1 from styles of Nicotiana alata and AGPPc 1 from cell suspension cultures of Pyrus communis, undergo C-terminal processing involving glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane anchors. The evidence is that (i) the transmembrane helix at the C terminus predicted from the cDNA encoding these proteins is not present—the C-terminal amino acid is Asn 87 and Ser 97 for AGPNa 1 and AGPPc 1, respectively; (ii) both AGP <b>protein</b> <b>backbones</b> are substituted with ethanolamine at the C-terminal amino acid; and (iii) inositol, glucosamine, and mannose {{are present in the}} native AGPs.

This sequence information allowed the cloning of a 712 -bp cDNA, AGPNa 1. AGPNa 1 encodes a 132 -amino acid protein with three domains: an N-terminal secretion signal sequence, which is cleaved from the mature protein; a central sequence, which contains {{most of the}} hydroxyproline/proline residues; and a C-terminal hydrophobic region. AGPNa 1 is expressed in many tissues of N. alata and related species.

2500|$|The alpha sheet {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a possible intermediate state in the conformational change {{in the formation of}} amyloid fibrils by peptides and proteins such as amyloid beta, poly-glutamine repeats, lysozyme, prion proteins, and transthyretin repeats, all of which are associated with protein misfolding disease. For example, amyloid beta is a major component of amyloid plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients, and polyglutamine repeats in the huntingtin protein are associated with Huntington's disease. These proteins undergo a conformational change from largely random coil or alpha helix structures to the highly ordered beta sheet structures found in amyloid fibrils. Most beta sheets in known proteins are [...] "twisted" [...] about 15° for optimal hydrogen bonding and steric packing; however, some evidence from electron crystallography suggests that at least some amyloid fibrils contain [...] "flat" [...] sheets with only 1-2.5° of twist. An alpha-sheet amyloid intermediate is suggested to explain some anomalous features of the amyloid fibrillization process, such as the evident amino acid sequence dependence of amyloidogenesis despite the belief that the amyloid fold is mainly stabilized by the <b>protein</b> <b>backbone.</b>|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Molecular Distance Geometry Problem (MDGP) is {{the problem}} of finding the {{possible}} conformations of a molecule by exploiting available information about distances between some atom pairs. When particular assumptions are satisfied, the MDGP can be discretized, so that the search domain of the problem becomes a tree. This tree can be explored by using an interval Branch & Prune (iBP) algorithm. In this context, the order given to the atoms of the molecules plays an important role. In fact, the discretization assumptions are strongly dependent on the atomic ordering, which can also impact the computational cost of the iBP algorithm. In this work, we propose a new partial discretization order for <b>protein</b> <b>backbones.</b> This new atomic order optimizes a set of objectives, that aim at improving the iBP performances. The optimization of the objectives is performed by Answer Set Programming (ASP), a declarative programming language that allows to express our problem by a set of logical constraints.
