2500|$|Regular table-style fully {{automated}} tenpin pinspotters from AMF and Brunswick, from their beginnings {{earlier in the}} 20th century, have been required by the United States Bowling Congress {{to be able to}} accurately re-spot [...] "off-spot" [...] pins that have been knocked out of position, sometimes up to 15cm from the normal setting position, and then place them back onto the lane in the same location.

In 1936, Harry Franklin invented the mechanical pinsetter while with the AMF firm, which largely did away with pinsetting as a manual profession, although a small number of bowling alleys still use human pinsetters. [...] While humans usually no longer set the pins, a pinchaser, or in slang 'pin monkey', often is stationed near the equipment to ensure that it is clean and working properly, and to clear minor jams.|$|E

In 1956 it was expanded and AMF automatic <b>pinspotters</b> were installed and the remodeled Fireside was expanded by four lanes bringing the total to 16.|$|R
2500|$|Regular duckpin bowling {{is popular}} in the northeastern and mid-Atlantic United States. [...] One popular <b>pinspotter</b> in this sport is the Sherman model, named after its inventor, Ken Sherman, which was {{produced}} from 1953-1973.

2500|$|The GSX is Brunswick's current pinsetter. This machine uses a {{conveyor}} belt on the pit floor to move the pins to a vertical elevator system {{similar to the ones}} utilized on the AMF 82 series <b>pinspotters,</b> while the ball exits the pit at the side through a ball door. Pins are loaded using a combination of belts. [...] The ball return system on this machine uses an under-lane accelerator as opposed to a lift. It lowers the pin table on every cycle to determine scoring.|$|R
50|$|American Machine and Foundry (AMF, Inc.) began a {{joint venture}} to {{manufacture}} <b>pinspotters</b> in Australia in 1959 {{in view of the}} growing popularity of ten-pin bowling in the country. By 1964 1,600 bowling lanes existed in Australia, but the popularity of the sport had begun to decline. After Commonwealth Ventures' 1985 purchase of AMF's bowling division to form AMF Bowling Companies, Inc. (later known as AMF Bowling Worldwide), the company bought two major Australian bowling chains to revive interest in bowling. AMF Australia expanded from 16 bowling centres to 30 by 1987, and to over 40 by 2004.|$|R
5000|$|An {{elevator}} {{composed of}} a rotating rack of open frames (similar to an industrial toaster) catches the candlepins and hauls them towards {{the top of the}} machine, and then turns 90 degrees to bring the pins horizontally across, bringing the pins past ten conveyors each wide enough to hold pins in a lengthwise orientation. Unlike the <b>pinspotters</b> used for tenpins and duckpins, since candlepins have identical [...] "ends" [...] to them, the machine does not have to orient the candlepins in one particular direction. The pins fall off the end of the conveyors into spotting tubes, mounted at their base onto the plate that forms {{the main part of the}} spotting table. As the sweep nears the forward end of its travel, and then begins its ascent to its resting position, the table drops to the metal plate pindeck at the end of the lanebed, and release a set of pins, and then ascends to its own resting position, ready to be filled with pins once more.|$|R

50|$|Originally an ironworks-foundry {{building}} in the 1880s, Brooklyn Bowl was opened by Peter Shapiro on July 7, 2009. It took over two years to construct and cost millions. Upon opening, it became the first bowling alley in the country, and possibly the world, to be LEED certified, with its <b>pinspotter</b> machines using 75% less energy than typical pinspotters.|$|E
50|$|Many {{products}} of its predecessor companies remain in wide use. For example, the company's current <b>pinspotter</b> is the QubicaAMF XLi Edge, but many AMF 82-30, 82-70, and 82-90 models remain in active service in bowling {{centers on the}} world. Similarly, many centers still use Qubica Bowland, AMF AccuScore, AMF BOSS, or AMF MagicScore scoring systems while newer products have the QubicaAMF label.|$|E
2500|$|The 82-30's {{operation}} and mechanics, having been significantly developed from AMF's , which depended {{much on the}} use of suction to hold the pins in a double-sided spotting table for both spotting remaining pins and setup of new racks of pins, are quite different from the Model A, A-2 and JetBack units from Brunswick (which the AMF 82-10 pre-dated by almost a decade), with differing sweep and table designs, and especially in how the pins are handled for storage, after they got {{to the top of the}} machinery. After the bowler rolls their ball, and knocking down the pins, the ball strikes the pit cushion block. This activates the machine, which lowers the sweep to the guard position. Then the table descends and the respot cells close around the heads of the standing pins. The cells that have pins in them complete electrical circuits that send scoring information to the display, and turned on one or more of ten [...] "pindicator" [...] lights – pioneered by AMF in May 1953 – in an electrically illuminated triangular framed screen on the <b>pinspotter's</b> masking unit in front of the machine, to identify remaining pins.|$|R
50|$|Patterson {{encountered}} {{a prototype of}} an automatic bowling-pin setter. To get the cash to develop the invention, Patterson swapped AMF stock to acquire eight small companies with fast-selling products. After incorporating key features developed by Leslie L.
