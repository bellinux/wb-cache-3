5|$|Some {{parts of}} Western Europe, {{especially}} Scandinavian {{countries have been}} creating family friendly policies that have aided them in equalizing the gender difference in {{participation in the work}} force.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2010. Major: Sociology. Advisor: DR. Phyllis Moen. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 336 pages, appendices 1 - 16. Women‟s labor force participation {{has increased dramatically}} across all advanced capitalist democracies over the last 50 years. However, women continue to face significant employment inequality in hours of employment, pay, and occupational gender segregation. These changes in women‟s employment outcomes have {{captured the attention of}} welfare state researchers and policymakers and have radically altered our understanding of the welfare state. In this dissertation, I empirically assess how both welfare state policies and changes in the labor market influence women‟s employment outcomes across 14 welfare states from 1960 to 2008. The countries in this analysis are Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, (West) Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In this research, I focus primarily on family policies, a subset of state social policies that mediate the relationship between the market and family, and allow men and women to engage in care-taking responsibilities without losing their labor market position and rewards. The family policies I consider include <b>parental</b> <b>leaves,</b> publicly funded childcare, and family allowances, support benefits, and tax credits. These policies are intriguing because there is evidence that much of the gap between men‟s and women‟s employment outcomes is caused by motherhood. Family policies are targeted specifically at mothers and families with children, and so should, theoretically, reduce the inequality between men‟s and women‟s employment outcomes. However, there is relatively little research into the role that family polices play in employment inequality at the aggregate level, especially in hours of work, the wage gap, or occupational gender segregation. This dissertation fills in that research gap by investigating the impact of family policies on women‟s labor force participation rates, women‟s rate of and share of part-time work and involuntary part-time work, the male/female wage gap, and occupational gender segregation, while accounting for other welfare state policies and activities and labor market factors that have been linked to women‟s employment outcomes. In my analysis, I find that <b>parental</b> <b>leaves</b> increase labor force participation rates among young women and reduce the male-female wage gap. Publicly funded childcare increases labor force participation rates among young women, decreases women‟s concentration in part-time employment and in involuntary part-time employment, and reduces the male-female wage gap. Importantly, neither <b>parental</b> <b>leaves</b> nor childcare policies appear to be strongly related to occupational gender segregation. On the other hand, family allowances and support benefits decrease labor force participation rates for women ages 25 - 34 and increase occupational gender segregation. My analysis provides evidence that generous maternity and <b>parental</b> <b>leaves</b> and high levels of publicly funded childcare work to reduce employment inequality between men and women by reducing inequalities in hours of work and reducing the male-female pay gap. The finding for the pay gap is particularly exciting because recent research has found that much of the pay gap across countries {{has been shown to be}} due to motherhood. I conclude with implications and directions for future research...|$|R

25|$|In 1984, a law {{was passed}} to ensure that {{divorced}} women who were not in receipt of maintenance would be provided with assistance in recovering the shortfall in their income from their former husband. By 1986, particular attention was being focused on assisting women in single-parent families {{to get back into}} employment, in recognition of the growing problems associated with extra-marital births and marital breakdown. <b>Parental</b> <b>leave</b> was extended to firms with 100 employees in 1981 (previously, <b>parental</b> <b>leave</b> provision had been made in 1977 for firms employing at least 200 employees) and subsequently to all employees in 1984.

25|$|An Act of January 1984 {{asserted}} a {{right for}} all parents {{to benefit from}} a <b>parental</b> <b>leave</b> of absence for childrearing, providing that they have one year’s seniority.

For those with disabilities, a 1982 law on urban transport reform stated that special measures {{must be taken to}} accommodate the special needs of people with limited mobility. A law passed on 9 July 1984 provided that a worker with at least two years' service must receive a redundancy payment based on gross earnings prior to termination of the work contract. The law further provided that workers aged 60 or above who voluntarily left the firm would receive a retirement severance grant.|$|E

The measure takes into consideration the ethics of caretaking and is characterized by the value of reciprocity.

The theoretical part examines the current Czech legislation in this area within an international context. Both the legislative and financial tools are subsequently analyzed in the practical part.

30|$|The {{factor of}} the first PCA (Factor 1, {{henceforth}} called POL) is highly correlated with <b>parental</b> <b>leaves</b> and family subsidies (with factor loadings larger than 0.8) and moderately correlated with the extent of subsidies to the elderly (factor loading approximately equal to 0.26). The higher the load the more relevant it is in defining the factor’s dimensionality. Hence our first factor reasonably represents the generosity of national welfare regimes to households with dependent children. The factor of the second PCA (Factor 2, henceforth called INST 24) is defined by active and passive labour market policies (with factor loadings larger than 0.9), while the extent of employment protection legislation exerts an inverse impact on it (with negative factor loading, - 0.15). Hence, this factor resumes the degree of flexicurity of national labour market institutions 25.|$|R

40|$|Female {{employment}} {{rates in}} Russia have declined substantially {{since the end}} of the Soviet period. At the same time, there has been pronounced change in policies enabling women to balance work and family, or “familial policies. ” The availability of child care has contracted sharply, and long maternity and <b>parental</b> <b>leaves</b> have been introduced. This paper describes these changes within the context of Russia in transition, and explores the effect of child care and leave policy on women’s employment using the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey. We conclude that, over the longer-term, women are more likely to remain employed if they work for enterprises which provide child care and maternity leaves. Yet new, private enterprises are less likely to provide such leaves, painting a somewhat bleak picture of the long-term employment prospects for women in Russia.

40|$|Using nationally {{representative}} {{data on the}} employed, we assess the effects of gender {{as well as the}} intersection of race and gender on family leave taking post-FMLA.

Although men across race are less likely to take leaves for newborns, they are almost as likely as women to take leaves for seriously ill children and parents and as likely to take leaves for spouses. Men, regardless of race, tend to take shorter leaves than women. Our results have important implications for the design of leave policy: the broadening of family <b>leaves</b> beyond <b>parental</b> <b>leaves</b> reduces inequality in likelihood of leave; the introduction of leaves for routine family demands probably does little to reduce gender inequality; unpaid leaves mandated by the FMLA may sustain inequality...|$|R

Through case studies of newspaper carriers, rural route mail couriers, personal care workers, and freelance editors - four groups who have led pioneering efforts to organize - the authors provide a window into the ways political and economic conditions interact with class, ethnicity, and gender to shape the meaning and strategies of working men and women and show how these strategies have changed over time. They argue that the experiences of these workers demonstrate a pressing need to expand collective bargaining rights to include them. [URL]...|$|R
