40|$|The common legal {{assumptions}} {{in regard}} to memory come most clearly to the surface in the rules governing present recollection revived, <b>past</b> <b>recollection</b> <b>recorded,</b> and cross-examination to impeach. Between the first two, sharp distinctions are drawn which result partly {{from the fact that}} a memorandum used to refresh recollection generally does not go to the jury as evi dence - whereas a memorandum of past recollection does - and partly from the psychological theories of the courts. Thus a federal judge lately remarked: 2 ̆ 2 It is one thing to awaken a slumbering recollection of an event, but quite another to use a memorandum of a recollection, fresh when it was correctly recorded, but presently beyond the power of the witness so to restore that it will exist apart from the record. In the former case it is quite immaterial by what means the memory is quickened; it may be a song, or a face, or a newspaper item, or a writing of some character. It is sufficient that by some mental operation, however mysterious, the memory is stimulated to recall the event, for when so set in motion it functions quite independently of the actuating cause. 2 ̆...|$|E

50|$|A <b>recorded</b> <b>recollection</b> (sometimes {{referred}} to as a prior <b>recollection</b> <b>recorded),</b> in the law of evidence, is an exception to the hearsay rule which allows witnesses to testify to the accuracy of a recording or documentation of their own out-of-court statement based on their recollection of the circumstances under which the statement was recorded or documented - even though the witness does not remember the events attested to in the statement. It is sufficient that the witness is able to testify to having made the recording, and to having written an accurate statement at that time.|$|R
60|$|No {{one else}} was at hand, and the {{emergency}} was a serious one.

The alternative lay between irritating and alarming her by leaving her inquiries unanswered, or trusting Captain Wragge. In the doctor's opinion, the second risk was the least serious risk of the two--and the captain was now seated at Magdalen's bedside in discharge of the trust confided to him.|$|R

40|$|The article investigates Harold Pinter’s play Silence from a {{linguistic}} and phenomenological point of view. Silence {{is probably one}} of the least studied – though one of the most difficult and compelling – of Pinter’s plays. The author iden­tifies the broken syntax and the combi­nation of utterances and silences as indicators of time and space shifts. She claims that the patchwork which appears from the structure of the play depicts the loss of logic, and that the abandonmen­t of chronological time in linguistic terms conveys the subjecti­ve, circular, and illogical elemen­t of the human experience of time. Characters’ bodies and utterances materialize both their own <b>past</b> <b>recollections</b> and their presen­t experiences. The presen­t work may be useful to theatre scholars as an example of drama as a portrayal of philosophical and linguistic theories about time and discourse...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Human {{experience}} {{takes place}} in the line of mental-time (MT) created through imagination of oneself in different time-points in past or future (self-projection in time). Here we manipulated self-projection in MT not only with respect to one's life-events but also with respect to one's faces from different past and future time-points. Methods: We here compared MTT with respect to one's facial images from different time points in past and future (study 1 : MT-faces) as well as with respect to different past and future life events (study 2 : MT-events). Participants were asked to make judgments about past and future face images and past and future events from three different time-points: the present (Now), eight years earlier (Past) or eight years later (Future). In addition, as a control task participants were asked to make recognition judgments with respect to faces and memory-related judgments with respect to events without changing their habitual self-location in time. Behavioral measures and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity after subtraction of recognition and memory related activities show both absolute MT and relative MT effects for faces and events, signifying a fundamental brain mechanism of MT, disentangled from episodic memory functions. Results: Behavioural and event-related fMRI activity showed three independent effects characterized by (1) similarity between <b>past</b> <b>recollection</b> and future imagination, (2) facilitation of judgments related to the future as compared to the past, and (3) facilitation of judgments related to time-points distant from the present. These effects were found with respect to faces and events suggesting that the brain mechanisms of MT are independent of whether actual life episodes have to be re-/pre-experienced and recruited a common cerebral network including the medial-temporal, precuneus, inferior-frontal, temporo-parietal, and insular cortices. Conclusions: These behavioural and neural data suggest that self-projection in time is a crucial aspect of MT, relying on neural structures encoding memory, mental imagery, and self. Furthermore our results emphasize the idea that mental temporal processing is more strongly directed to future prediction than to <b>past</b> <b>recollection...</b>|$|R

Jack's motive in making his revelations might possibly have been tinctured with jealousy, but a desire to save one as young and innocent as Rose was at its bottom. Few persons but a wife would have supposed our heroine could have been in any danger from a lover like Spike; but Jack saw him with the eyes of her own youth, and of <b>past</b> <b>recollections,</b> rather than with those of truth. A movement of the wounded man first drew Rose from the window. Drying her eyes hastily, she turned toward him, fancying she might prove the better nurse of the two, notwithstanding Jack's greater interest in the patient.|$|R
40|$|Individuals {{perceive}} beauty as {{a function}} of physical attributes paired with the subjective experience of an object or a space. Yet, little or no research has investigated how either relational or emotional experiences shape perceptions of the physical world. Four studies were conducted to address this question using self-determination theory (Ryan and Deci in Psychol Inq 11 : 319 – 338, 2000) as a guiding framework. Studies 1 and 2 indicated that satisfaction of the needs for competence, relatedness, and autonomy in one’s childhood home was linked to perceptions of beauty directly and indirectly through emotions of the <b>past</b> (<b>recollections</b> of happiness) and present (nostalgia). Two additional studies focused on present-day spaces. In Study 3, we found that need satisfaction impacted perceptions of the university campus as beautiful. In a final study, we manipulated needs in the lab to identify a causal model of aesthetic perceptions. Findings are contextualized within the self-determination theory and perceived beauty literatures...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} an autoethnography {{exploring}} my experiences {{of living with}} Obsessive Compulsive “disorder” (OCD). The stigma surrounding mental health {{is one of the}} most devastating and problematic issues in Western society today. Many individuals with a mental “disorder” suffer in silence due to the shame and fear of being ridiculed and discriminated against within their intimate and wider social networks. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is currently one of the most prevalent anxiety “disorders” and is characterized by intruding obsessive thoughts and ritualized or compulsive behaviours. Individuals experience a great deal of distress and embarrassment in dealing with the stigma and misunderstanding surrounding the “disorder”. Currently, however, there is a dearth of research literature examining the subjective and intimate accounts of those struggling with mental health issues in general and OCD in particular. In this study, I address this gap in the literature by providing deeply personal autoethnographic accounts of my own experiences of living with OCD. My data sources are current self-observations, <b>past</b> <b>recollections,</b> and a collection of personal poems, reflections, stories, and journal entries. By using an interpretive approach within the social constructionist framework, I look at both my internal subjective struggles and external societal stigmatization. Three major themes emerge from my thematic analysis of the data: guilt, shame, and hope. I discuss these findings in three chapters and provide the implications for social work in my concluding remark. In narrating my personal struggles and successes, I hope to contribute to deeper understanding of mental health and OCD, while also challenging dominant societal discourses and misrepresentations of mental “disorders”...|$|R
