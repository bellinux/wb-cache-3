This, however, follows a long-term trend which is, at least in part, endogenous, i.e. not strictly depending on the reform itself, and in part it falls under {{the dynamics of the}} long-term history of the sector. An interesting aspect of this trend leads to outline the relation between the role, which should have been played by <b>preferential</b> <b>sugar</b> imports from ACP/LDCs, and the strategies of the EU sugar companies, which have probably tried to counteract the potential effect of preferential imports on internal competition by reshaping the organisation of the sugar supply chain (also in its geographic aspects, as mentioned in “Concentration and competition”).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the performance}} of the Fiji Sugar Corporation {{on the basis of its}} annual financial reports for the period 1997 - 2002. The analysis shows the following: that despite FSC undertaking an internal restructuring, there is no evidence of any material improvement in operating efficiency; there is no evidence of FSC having taken any initiative to foster grower-miller collaboration; and that despite FSC’s calls for a renegotiation of the Master Award there is no evidence to suggest that the revision of the Master Award sought would of itself solve FSC long term financial problems. The analysis indicates that with the removal of Fiji’s access to the <b>preferential</b> <b>sugar</b> markets equity holders’ interest in the corporation would be rapidly destroyed, given the industry’s current cost structure. The study also raises concern at the delays in the FSC taking out its annual reports...|$|E

These are analysed under three different policy settings: a continuation of current policies, except for export refunds which are phased out by 2013, a continuation of current policies including export refunds and finally a World Trade Organisation agreement. Preferential imports are estimated to clearly exceed current estimates by the European Commission. In all scenarios, however, they are not found to threaten the reference price of the new Common Market Organisation.

Results {{are discussed in the}} framework of the bioprotection phenomena. The analysis of the relative concentration of water oxygen atoms around lysozyme suggests that lysozyme is preferentially hydrated. When comparing the three sugars, trehalose is seen more excluded than maltose and sucrose. The <b>preferential</b> exclusion of <b>sugars</b> from the protein surface induces some differences in the behavior of trehalose and maltose, particularly at 50 and 60 wt% concentrations, that are not observed experimentally in binary sugar/mixtures. The dynamical slowing down of the solvent is suggested to mainly arise from the homogeneity of the water/sugar matrices controlled by the percolation of the sugar hydrogen bonds networks. Furthermore, lysozyme strongly increases relaxation times of solvent molecules at the protein/solvent interface. © 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|In a {{press release}} on July 10 th 2003 the European Commission {{condemned}} the Brazilian, Australian and Thai challenge to the EU's 'C' sugar exports, claiming it was 'nothing less than {{an attack on the}} EU's trade preferences for developing countries'. The Commission argued that the challenge risks 'undermining the benefits of the EU regime for many sugar-dependent developing countries, especially ACP countries'. EU Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy maintained that the WTO action could 'destabilise the sugar-dependent economies of small ACP countries', whilst merely deflecting attention form the real causes of depressed world market prices, namely the rapid expansion of Brazilian and Australian sugar exports (from 1. 6 million tonnes to 12 million tonnes in the case of Brazil). Comment: While the Commission maintains that EU exports of sugar are largely the result of the preferential import of 1. 9 million tonnes of sugar, {{the reality is that the}} EU has been exporting around 5 million tonnes per annum in recent years, with the system of quota administration within the EU encouraging overproduction. The Commission implies that the EBA preferences extended to LDCs are allowing increased sugar exports from developing countries. However the EU maintains in place a maximum-supply-needs ceiling which limits the total amount of <b>preferential</b> <b>sugar</b> imported into the EU. Increased LDC exports of sugar are thus at the expense of ACP beneficiaries of the special <b>preferential</b> <b>sugar</b> arrangement. This will remain the case until the EU raises the maximum-supply-needs ceiling or LDCs are given full duty-free access in 2009. While the European Commission maintains that the WTO challenge is likely to destabilise ACP sugar-dependent economies, the eventual extension of CAP reform to the sugar sector, involving a shift from price support to direct aid to farmers, is likely to profoundly affect the value of sugar preferences extended to ACP sugar suppliers. The prospect of sugar-sector reform may however have been deferred by the June 26 th 2003 decision to retain the vast majority of the funds generated by 'modulation' for investment in rural development rather than additional sectoral reform.

40|$|BioengineeringMicroorganisms often {{encounter}} {{a mixture of}} different carbon sources and therefore have control systems to selectively take up and metabolize those substrates that promise the best success in competition with other species through rapid growth. The aim of this thesis is to understand and eliminate carbon catabolite repression (CCR) in Escherichia coli for efficient utilization of multiple energy and carbon sources simultaneously. We studied a new CCR hierarchy that causes the <b>preferential</b> utilization of <b>sugars</b> (arabinose, galactose, glucose, mannose, and xylose) over a short-chain fatty acid (propionate). Meanwhile, the native promoters of xylose catabolic genes and xylose transporter genes were replaced with synthetic constitutive promoters to construct an E. coli strain capable of co-metabolizing glucose and xylose by eliminating the CCR of xylose metabolism by glucose. We showed that such an approach can provide a potential to eliminate CCR. This knowledge will be valuable to help strain improvement strategies for the simultaneous consumption of sugar mixtures, leading to shorter fermentation time and higher substrate range and productivity. ope...|$|R
40|$|Carbon catabolite {{repression}} (CCR) {{is a well-known}} phenomenon that involves the preferential utilization of glucose as a carbon source. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and the CAMP receptor protein (CRP) mediate CCR. Recently, a second CCR hierarchy {{that leads to the}} preferential consumption of arabinose over xylose, mediated by arabinose-bound AraC, has been identified. In this study, we report yet another CCR hierarchy that causes the <b>preferential</b> utilization of <b>sugars</b> (arabinose, galactose, glucose, mannose, and xylose) over a short-chain fatty acid (propionate). Expression of the propionate catabolic (prpBCDE) genes is down-regulated in the presence of these sugars. Sugar-mediated repression of the propionate catabolic genes is independent of sugar-specific regulators such as AraC and dependent on global regulators of sugar transport such as the cAMP-CRP complex and the Phosphotransferase System (PTS). Inhibition of the prpBCDE promoter is encountered during rapid sugar uptake and metabolism. This unique regulatory crosstalk between sugar metabolism and fatty acid metabolism may help provide new insights into CRP-dependent {{catabolite repression}} acting in conjunction with non-carbohydrate metabolism. close...|$|R
40|$|World sugar {{production}} has consistently overrun {{demand in the}} past five years. Moreover, in 2017 the European Sugar Regime will expire, ending the quota system and <b>preferential</b> <b>sugar</b> prices, largely affecting small producers, particularly in Africa. Diversification emerges as an option for sugar-oriented mills. Two evident alternatives are ethanol and electricity production that allow better use of molasses and cane fibers, respectively. Molasses is the cheapest feedstock for ethanol production, while the cane fibers—in the form of bagasse—are readily available at the mill. The transition from sugar to sugar, ethanol and electricity may require substantial investment capital, yet our results show that significant progress can start at relatively small cost. In this work, we use simulations to explore the impact of ethanol and electricity production in an existing sugar mill in Mozambique. In spite of the large amounts of energy obtained from ambitious scenarios, such as Ethanol- 2 and Ethanol/EE, molasses-based ethanol (Ethanol- 1 scenario) seems more attractive in economical and infrastructural terms.

40|$|Carbon catabolite {{repression}} (CCR) {{is a key}} regulatory system found in most microorganisms that ensures preferential utilization of energy-efficient carbon sources. CCR helps microorganisms obtain a proper balance between their metabolic capacity and the maximum sugar uptake capability. It also constrains the deregulated utilization of a preferred cognate substrate, enabling microorganisms to survive and dominate in natural environments. On {{the other side of}} the same coin lies the tenacious bottleneck in microbial production of bioproducts that employs a combination of carbon sources in varied proportion, such as lignocellulose-derived sugar mixtures. <b>Preferential</b> <b>sugar</b> uptake combined with the transcriptional and/or enzymatic exclusion of less preferred sugars turns out one of the major barriers in increasing the yield and productivity of fermentation process. Accumulation of the unused substrate also complicates the downstream processes used to extract the desired product. To overcome this difficulty and to develop tailor-made strains for specific metabolic engineering goals, quantitative and systemic understanding of the molecular interaction map behind CCR is a prerequisite. Here we comparatively review the universal and strain-specific features of CCR circuitry and discuss the recent efforts in developing synthetic cell factories devoid of CCR particularly for lignocellulose-based biorefinery. close 11...|$|E

MeSGal {{accumulated in}} the cell as MeSGal-phosphate (MeSGalP). Three effects were noted when various sugars were added to MeSGal preloaded cells: (i) no decrease in intracellular MeSGalP concentration after addition of fructose, sucrose, o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactoside, glycerol, 6 -deoxyglucose, alpha-methyl D-glucoside, 2 -deoxygalactose, glucose 1 -phosphate, or glucose 6 -phosphate; (ii) slow loss of preaccumulated MeSGalP evoked by lactose, 2 -deoxy-D-glucose, or unlabeled MeSGal; and (iii) a short lag followed by extremely rapid expulsion of intracellular MeSGalP elicited by glucose or mannose and a slower expulsion elicited by glucosamine. The expelled compound was free MeSGal, indicating the involvement of dephosphorylation in the expulsion mechanism. Deoxyglucose inhibited the expulsion evoked by mannose, and prepoisoning of cells with fluoride or arsenate prevented the glucose-dependent expulsion. The expulsion is due to activation of an expulsion mechanism rather than to turnover of MeSGalP and leak of internal MeSGal with concomitant inhibition of MeSGal influx. The results {{suggest the need for}} phosphotransferase-dependent translocation of a <b>preferential</b> <b>sugar</b> or accumulation of the sugar catabolite for expulsion activation.

To enhance its genetic stability, several genomic DNA [...] integrated strains of Z. mobilis have been developed through the insertion of all seven genes necessay for xylose and arabinose fermentation into the Zymomonas genome.

Without these preferences, sugar export revenues would decline significantly. These preferences are likely to erode in the next several years as the sugar programs of both the European Union and the United States are under pressure to reform as part of already agreed international commitments, internal pressures, and the ongoing Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations. The European Commission has already proposed reforms that would reduce internal sugar prices by 39 percent, directly affecting Caribbean sugar exporters. This presents a serious challenge to the sugar producers of the Caribbean who are mostly high-cost producers who will find it difficult to compete in the world market. St. Kitts&Nevis have recently announced plans to close their sugar industry and Trinidad&Tobago began a major restructuring program in 2003. Other sugar producers of the Caribbean will need to become more competitive by reducing costs and adding value to their sugar industries through cogeneration of energy and other activities.

Swaziland’s other key trading partners are the United States and the EU, from whom the country has received trade preferences for apparel exports (under the African Growth and Opportunity Act - AGOA - to the US) and for sugar (to the EU). Under these agreements, both apparel and sugar exports did well, with rapid growth and a strong inflow of foreign direct investment. Textile exports grew by over 200 percent between 2000 and 2005 and sugar exports increasing by more than 50 percent over the same period.

40|$|Genomic {{analysis}} and physiological experiments {{conducted on the}} lignocellulosic biomass degrading bacterium C. phytofermentans, indicates that it can degrade and utilize a wide-range of carbohydrates as possible growth substrates. Previous experiments characterized gene expression using custom whole genome oligonucleotide microarrays. The results indicated that C. phytofermentans utilizes ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters for carbohydrate uptake and does not use the sole phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system (PTS) {{for any of the}} tested substrates. Distinct sets of Carbohydrate Active Enzymes (CAZy) genes were also up-regulated on specific substrates indicative of C. phytofermentans ability to selectively degrade lignocellulosic biomass. We also identified a highly expressed cluster of genes which includes seven extracellular glycoside hydrolases and two ABC transporters with unknown specificity on a number of substrates. These results lead to the hypothesis that when grown on plant biomass, C. phytofermentansis capable of degrading and transporting all major carbohydrate components of lignocellulose biomass. To test this, C. phytofermentans was grown on three different lignocellulosic biomass substrates (Brachypodium distachyon, cornstover, and switchgrass). Gene expression and HPLC analysis indicated that C. phytofermentans is utilizing multiple substrates with multiple sugar ABC transporter clusters, glycoside hydrolases, and sugar utilization pathways being expressed. To further test this,the sugar utilization pattern for C. phytofermentans was investigated. Growth studies were performed on individual saccaharides (glucose, cellobiose, xylose, and fucose) as well as combinations of all these sugars. From these studies we determined that C. phytofermentans does not show a characteristic diauxic shift indicative of <b>preferential</b> <b>sugar</b> utilization or carbon catabolite repression (CCR). This result was supported further by HPLC analysis indicating that co-utilization of sugars was occurring, however their were differences in the rates of consumption. Expression analysis of dual sugar combinations of glucose/cellobiose, glucose/xylose, and glucose/fucose also shows that genes involved in the transport and utilization of each sugar are expressed. We also noted glucose repression of some of the glyocside hydrolases which are normally expressed on xylose and fucose.

40|$|The ongoing trade negotiations, {{unilateral}} trade {{concessions and}} {{obligations under the}} WTO are pushing the EU sugar regime to undertake reforms. These reforms will alter the positions of developing countries in the global sugar markets. This paper will describe the trade preferences granted to developing countries under the EU sugar regime. Sugar imports into the EU from the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) {{are expected to be}} totally liberalised from year 2009 onwards because of the ?Everything But Arms? (EBA) concession. During the transition period until year 2009, the EBA concession is gradually granting quota preferences and partial duty-free access to sugar imports from the LDCs. Simultaneously, the temporary import quotas (Special <b>Preferential</b> <b>Sugar)</b> given to the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries are assumed to be decreasing during the transition period. Within this background, a complete unilateral liberalisation of the EU sugar sector is simulated to depict the winners and losers in the global sugar markets if no preferences are governing the imports of sugar into the EU. The supply responses, which strongly affect the outcomes, are dependent on both the nature of substitution for sugar {{as well as on the}} efficiency of sugar production in different countries. The multi-region general equilibrium framework (GTAP) is used for this analysis. The results show that small concessions will not threaten the EU internal market, but total liberalisation of sugar imports from the LDCs will be a major threat to the EU sugar regime. The current regime limits sugar imports from all developing countries or some efficient producers, if the cost data is a right estimate of the potential supply response from developing countries. The LDCs will be the winners under the EBA concession supported by the current regime, but a few efficient sugar producers will be the winners if the current regime is entirely liberalised.

To investigate the consequences of decreased TK expression for primary and secondary metabolism, we transformed tobacco with a construct containing an antisense TK sequence. The results were as follows: (1) a 20 to 40 % reduction of TK activity inhibited ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate regeneration and photosynthesis. The inhibition of photosynthesis became greater as irradiance increased across the range experienced in growth conditions (170 to 700 �mol m � 2 sec � 1). TK almost completely limited the maximum rate of photosynthesis in saturating light and saturating CO 2. (2) Decreased expression of TK led to a <b>preferential</b> decrease of <b>sugars,</b> whereas starch remained high until photosynthesis was strongly inhibited.

The erosion of <b>preferential</b> prices for <b>sugar</b> and the declining production in the agricultural sector is going to further reduce the demand for agricultural land leases and this could lead to more land being left idle.
