5|$|In 1975 {{the local}} Morris dancer John Byfleet made {{a replica of}} the {{original}} Ooser, which he carved from a log using a <b>penknife.</b> This replica is on display at Dorset County Museum in Dorchester. It is taken from the museum twice a year, on May Day and St. George's Day, when it is used by the Wessex Morris Men as part of their seasonal festivities. In 2005, a journalist from The Guardian reported on a dawn ceremony performed by the troupe on May Day atop Giant Hill near Cerne Abbas. The ceremony involved one member carrying the Dorset Ooser replica atop his head, with other Morris men dancing around him; after the rite they proceeded, still dancing, to a local pub, the Red Lion. In summer 2006, the Wessex Morris Men took the replica to Melbury Osmond for the first time, where they performed a dance in a local street.|$|E

25|$|Corrigan {{had just}} stepped {{out the front}} door when he heard a second shot behind him. He turned and saw Switzer sliding down the wall with a {{surprised}} look on his face. Stiltz had shot him. Corrigan said he saw a closed <b>penknife</b> at Switzer's side, which he presumed fell out of his pocket or his hand. He then saw his stepfather shove Piott against the kitchen counter and threaten to kill him too. As Piott begged for his life, they heard emergency sirens. Corrigan thought this was the only reason Stiltz did not kill Piott. Corrigan said his stepfather lied in his account of the event before the coroner's jury.|$|E

25|$|Mailer {{married his}} second wife, Adele Morales, in 1954. She was a painter, {{well known in}} New York City. They had two daughters, Danielle and Elizabeth. Mailer stabbed her twice with a <b>penknife</b> during a party, {{puncturing}} her pericardium which needed emergency surgery. His wife would not press charges and he later pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of assault for a suspended sentence. Morales recovered and in 1997 published a memoir of their marriage entitled The Last Party, which recounted her husband stabbing her at a party and the aftermath. This incident has been {{a focal point for}} feminist critics of Mailer, who point to themes of sexual violence in his work.|$|E
500|$|A {{scene of}} the Pinchwife plot that {{combines}} farce and nightmare is Pinchwife's attempt to force Mrs Pinchwife to write a haughty farewell letter to Horner, using the Freudian threat to [...] "write whore with this <b>penknife</b> in your face" [...] (IV.ii.95). Like all Pinchwife's efforts it misfires, giving Mrs Pinchwife instead an opportunity to send Horner a fan letter.|$|E
500|$|From 1842 onwards, Chopin {{showed signs}} of serious illness. After a solo recital in Paris on 21 February 1842, he wrote to Grzymała: [...] "I have to lie in bed all day long, my mouth and tonsils are aching so much." [...] He was forced by illness to decline a written {{invitation}} from Alkan {{to participate in a}} repeat performance of the Beethoven Seventh Symphony arrangement at Érard's on 1 March 1843. Late in 1844, Charles Hallé visited Chopin and found him [...] "hardly able to move, bent like a half-opened <b>penknife</b> and evidently in great pain", although his spirits returned when he started to play the piano for his visitor. Chopin's health continued to deteriorate, particularly from this time onwards. Modern research suggests that apart from any other illnesses, he may also have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy.|$|E

60|$|It {{was good}} to see the little man eating the fowl. Ethel, who had never cut {{anything}} in her young existence, except her fingers now and then with her brother's and her governess's <b>penknives,</b> bethought her of asking Miss Honeyman to carve the chicken. Lady Anne, with clasped hands and streaming eyes, sate looking on at the ravishing scene.|$|R

500|$|Ellen's {{body was}} {{examined}} by five physicians: police surgeon Charles Templeman, his colleague Alexander Stalker, Edinburgh surgeon Henry Littlejohn and two local doctors, David Lennox and William Kinnear. They concluded that Ellen had been strangled from behind. Her right leg was broken {{in two places}} {{so it could be}} crammed into the crate. Incisions, made by the <b>penknife,</b> ran downwards along her abdomen and had been made [...] "within at most ten minutes of the time of death" [...] according to Templeman, Stalker and Littlejohn. Lennox disagreed and thought the wounds were made later on the basis that when he examined the body the wound was not everted, but Templeman and Stalker said the wound was everted when they examined the body. Littlejohn explained that as Lennox made his examination three days after the others, the shape of the wounds could have changed, to which Lennox agreed.|$|E
500|$|Bury was {{orphaned}} at {{an early}} age and was educated at a charitable school in the English Midlands. After a few years in regular employment, he fell into financial difficulty, was dismissed for theft, and became a street peddler. In 1887 he moved to London, where he married Ellen Elliot, who was probably a prostitute. During their stormy marriage, which lasted just over a year, they faced increasing financial hardship. In January 1889, they moved to Dundee. The following month, Bury strangled his wife with a rope, stabbed her dead body with a <b>penknife,</b> and hid the corpse in a box in their room. A few days later, he presented himself to the local police and was arrested for her murder. Tried and convicted, he was sentenced to death by hanging. Shortly before his execution, he confessed to the crime. Although Bury's guilt was not in doubt, Dundee had a history of opposition to the death penalty and The Dundee Courier printed an editorial the day after his execution decrying the [...] "judicial butcheries" [...] of capital punishment.|$|E
500|$|The first {{songs to}} be {{released}} were [...] "I Know His Blood Can Make Me Whole" [...] and [...] "Jesus Make Up My Dying Bed", on Columbia's popular 14000 Race series. Johnson's debut became a substantial success, as 9,400 copies were pressed, more than the latest release by one of Columbia's most established stars, Bessie Smith, and an additional pressing of 6,000 copies followed. His fifth recorded song, [...] "Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground", eventually the B-side of Johnson's second release, best exemplifies his unique guitar playing in open D tuning for slide. For the session, Johnson substituted a knife or <b>penknife</b> for the bottleneck and—according to Harris—he played with a thumb pick. His melancholy, indescribable humming of the guitar part creates the impression of [...] "unison moaning", a style of singing hymns that is common in southern African-American church choirs. In 1928, the blues critic Edward Abbe Niles praised Johnson in his column for The Bookman, emphasizing his [...] "violent, tortured, and abysmal shouts and groans, and his inspired guitar playing".|$|E
6000|$|Five {{minutes of}} his stroll {{brought him to}} a certain corner, where a number of silent, pale-faced men are {{accustomed}} to stand, immovably, for hours, busy with the file blades of their <b>penknives,</b> with their hat brims on a level with their eyelids. Wall Street speculators, driving home in their carriages, love to point out these men to their visiting friends and tell them of this rather famous lounging-place of the [...] "crooks." [...] On Wall Street the speculators never use the file blades of their knives.|$|R
5000|$|The pair began asserting their {{perceived}} immunity from normal restrictions with acts of petty theft and vandalism. Breaking into a fraternity {{house at the}} university, they stole <b>penknives,</b> a camera, and a typewriter that they later used to type their ransom note. Emboldened, they progressed {{to a series of}} more serious crimes, including arson, but no one seemed to notice. Disappointed with the absence of media coverage of their crimes, they decided to plan and execute a sensational [...] "perfect crime" [...] that would garner public attention, and confirm their self-proclaimed status as [...] "supermen".|$|R
50|$|Grierson {{was very}} overweight, {{and used to}} go {{red in the face}} from bending over, due to high blood pressure, and Edmonds later claimed that his staff were issued with <b>penknives</b> to bleed him if necessary. He died of an aneurism of the heart on a train, near Amiens at 7:00 a.m. on 17 August 1914. His {{replacement}} as commander of II Corps was Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien. Grierson spoke French fluently and was a personal friend of Haig, the commander of I Corps, so it is possible that relations over the next few days, both between the two British corps and with the French, might have been better had he lived.|$|R
500|$|Tintin infiltrates the Soviet {{army and}} warns {{some of the}} kulaks to hide their grain, but the army catches him and {{sentences}} him to death by firing squad. By planting blanks in the soldiers' rifles, Tintin fakes his death {{and is able to}} make his way into the snowy wilderness, where he discovers an underground Bolshevik hideaway in a haunted house. A Bolshevik then captures him and informs him, [...] "You're in the hideout where Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin have collected together wealth stolen from the people!" [...] With Snowy's help, Tintin escapes, commandeers a plane, and flies into the night. The plane crashes, but Tintin fashions a new propeller from a tree using a <b>penknife,</b> and continues to Berlin. The OGPU agents appear and lock Tintin in a dungeon, but he escapes with the aid of Snowy, who has dressed himself in a tiger costume. The last OGPU agent attempts to kidnap Tintin, but this attempt is foiled, leaving the agent threatening, [...] "We'll blow up all the capitals of Europe with dynamite!" [...] Tintin returns to Brussels amidst a huge popular reception.|$|E
500|$|Lamb {{returned}} {{to the police station}} and charged William with Ellen's murder. Ellen's jewellery, found in William's pockets, was confiscated. A preliminary search of the premises revealed chalk graffiti on the rear door of the flat, which read [...] "Jack Ripper [...] is at the back of this door", and on the stairwell leading up {{from the rear of the}} property, which read [...] "Jack Ripper is in this seller [...] ". The press and the police thought they had been written by a local boy before the tragedy, but the writer was never identified. A more extensive search the following morning found blood-stained clothing in the crate that had contained the body, and the remains of more clothing and some of Ellen's personal effects burned in the fireplace. The flat was bereft of furniture, indicating that it may have been burnt on the fire, either for heat or to destroy evidence. A large <b>penknife</b> was found with human flesh and blood upon it, and the rope that William had bought on the morning of 4 February was found with strands of Ellen's hair caught in the fibres.|$|E
500|$|In 1890, the Bridegrooms {{had moved}} to the National League. Burns, now 26, led the league in home runs (13) and RBI (128). He hit for the cycle on August 1, 1890—becoming the first Bridegroom to do so. The team won the National League pennant, and faced the Louisville Colonels in the 1890 World Series. The series ended in a 3–3–1 tie: bad weather led to the {{cancellation}} of more games. After the 1891 season, Burns's 1892 RBI total was third in the league, and his hits, doubles, triples, and batting average marks were the second highest on the Brooklyn team, now named the Grooms. In 1893, between games of a doubleheader, a teammate of Burns, Tom Daly, was sleeping in center field when Burns stabbed Daly with a <b>penknife.</b> Daly awoke and turned on the knife, leading to a severed tendon which kept Daly out for two weeks. Burns' 1894 batting average (.355) was the highest of his career; his hit and run totals were also the second highest in his career. Burns continued to play for the club until 1895, when he played for the New York Giants. In his final MLB year, Burns batted a combined [...]258 over 25 games.|$|E
50|$|Bowen's {{policies}} of activism {{on behalf of}} black civil rights outraged well-to-do white citizens of Washington, but even the Republicans who had enforced black rights and suffrage in the capital concluded that Bowen was far more interested in civil rights for blacks than in governing the city and administering public services. He spent extravagant portions of the city budget in creating schools and employment for blacks, which, while regarded as noble by the Republicans, drained the coffers of money that was intended for maintaining the city. Bowen was even charged with reducing street service to men using <b>penknives</b> to cut the grass between the cobblestones on Pennsylvania Avenue.|$|R

60|$|The {{next was}} a very unpropitious morning for a journey--muggy, damp, and drizzly. The horses in the stages that were going out, and had come through the city, were smoking so, that the outside {{passengers}} were invisible. The newspaper-sellers looked moist, and smelled mouldy; the wet ran off the hats of the orange-vendors as they thrust their heads into the coach windows, and diluted the insides in a refreshing manner. The Jews with the fifty-bladed <b>penknives</b> shut them up in despair; the men with the pocket-books made pocket-books of them. Watch-guards and toasting-forks were alike at a discount, and pencil-cases and sponges were a drug in the market.|$|R
500|$|During the 1820s and 1830s, Sherwood wrote a {{great many}} tracts for the poor; like her novels for the middle class, they [...] "taught the lessons of {{personal}} endurance, reliance on Providence, and acceptance of one's earthly status." [...] Emphasizing individual experience and one's personal relationship with God, they discouraged readers from attributing their successes or failures to [...] "larger economic and political forces." [...] In this, they resembled the Cheap Repository Tracts, {{many of which were}} written by Hannah More. [...] As Linda Peterson, a scholar of nineteenth-century women's literature, argues, Sherwood's tracts use a Biblical [...] "interpretative frame" [...] in order to highlight the fleetingness of earthly things. For example, in A Drive in the Coach through the Streets of London (1819), Julia is granted the privilege of shopping with her mother only if she will [...] "behave wisely in the streets" [...] and [...] "not give [...] mind to self-pleasing." [...] Of course, she cannot keep this promise and she eagerly peeks in at every store window and begs her mother to buy her everything she sees. [...] Her mother therefore allows her to select one item from every shop. Julia, ecstatic, chooses, among other things, blue satin boots, a <b>penknife,</b> and a new hat with flowers, until the pair reach the undertaker's shop. There her mood droops considerably and she realizes the moral of the lesson, recited by her mother, as she picks out a coffin: [...] "but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth" [...] (1 Timothy 5:6).|$|E

Liverpool, or Birmingham,--smokier than all England besides, unless Newcastle be the exception. It might have been Pluto's own metropolis, shrouded in sulphurous vapor; and, indeed, our approach to it had been by the Valley of the Shadow of Death, through a tunnel three miles in length, quite traversing the breadth and depth of a mountainous hill.|$|R

The scriptorium would also have contained desks where the monks could sit and copy texts, {{as well as the}} necessary ink wells, <b>penknives,</b> and quills. Cassiodorus also established a library where, {{at the end of the}} Roman Empire, he attempted to bring Greek learning to Latin readers and to preserve texts both sacred and secular for future generations. As its unofficial librarian, Cassiodorus collected as many manuscripts as he could, he also wrote treatises aimed at instructing his monks in the proper uses of texts.

Many fobs are small flashlights, compasses, calculators, <b>penknives,</b> discount cards, bottle openers, security tokens and USB flash drives. As electronic technology continues to become smaller and cheaper, miniature key-fob versions of (previously) larger devices are becoming common, such as digital photo frames, remote control units for garage door openers, barcode scanners and simple video games (e.g. Tamagotchi) or other gadgets such as breathalyzers.|$|R
