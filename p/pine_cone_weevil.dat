40|$|Pitch canker, {{caused by}} the {{pathogen}} Fusarium circinatum, is a serious disease of pines, Pinus species. It {{is a threat to}} natural and planted pine forests, and to date it has invaded countries across five continents. Pine-feeding insects can {{play a key role in}} the epidemiology of the disease, as wounding agents allowing pathogen access or as vectors transmitting the pathogen from infected to healthy trees. We reviewed the role of insects in the epidemiology of pitch canker worldwide and assessed which insects are present in New Zealand that may act as wounding agents or vectors to determine whether pathogen invasion could adversely affect Pinus radiata plantation forests and urban trees. We also evaluated whether cone or seed insects of pines could be introduced as biological control agents of invasive Pinus contorta and how this may affect the impact of a potential F. circinatum invasion. As there are no native pines or other Pinaceae in New Zealand, there are only a few pine insects, mainly accidental introductions. None of the insects recorded on pines in New Zealand is likely to be a vector, suggesting low disease risk. Of six potentially suitable biocontrol candidates, the European <b>pine</b> <b>cone</b> <b>weevil</b> Pissodes validirostris is the most promising regarding host specificity and impact on seed production, but there is uncertainty about its ability to act as a vector of F. circinatum. Our methodology to review and evaluate the vector potential of pine associates can be used as a generic framework to assess the potential impacts of F. circinatum invasion...|$|E

40|$|A {{study on}} the removal of cadmium ions from aqueous {{solutions}} by <b>pine</b> <b>cone</b> was conducted in batch conditions. Kinetic data and equilibrium removal isotherms were obtained. The influence of different experimental parameters such as contact time, initial concentration of cadmium, <b>pine</b> <b>cone</b> mass and particle size, and temperature on the kinetics of cadmium removal was studied. Results showed that the main parameters that {{played an important role}} in removal phenomenon were initial cadmium concentration, particle size and <b>pine</b> <b>cone</b> mass. The necessary time to reach equilibrium was between 4 and 7 hours based on the initial concentration of cadmium. The capacity of cadmium adsorption at equilibrium increased with the decrease of <b>pine</b> <b>cone</b> particle size. The capacity of cadmium adsorption at equilibrium by <b>pine</b> <b>cone</b> increased with the quantity of <b>pine</b> <b>cone</b> introduced (1 – 4 g/L). Temperature in the range of 20 - 30 °C showed a restricted effect on the removal kinetics (13. 56 mg/g at 20 °C and a low capacity of adsorption about 11. 48 mg/g at 30 °C). The process followed pseudo second-order kinetics. The cadmium uptake of <b>pine</b> <b>cone</b> was quantitatively evaluated using adsorption isotherms.

40|$|<b>Pine</b> <b>cone,</b> {{a popular}} {{agricultural}} waste, was investigated as a novel ammonium biosorbent in its raw and sodium hydroxide modified form. Surface modification of <b>pine</b> <b>cone</b> powder {{were carried out}} using sodium hydroxide solution of concentarions (0, 05 and 0, 1 mg/L). The effects of physico-chemical parameters such as solution pH, contact time and biosorbent dosage were investigated in the biosorption of ammonium onto <b>pine</b> <b>cone</b> powder. It {{was found that the}} biosorption capacity was optimal using 6 – 10 solution pH range and the rate of sorption was very fast, during the first 15 min. Biosorption kinetics and equilibrium data for the romoval of NH 4 + ions onto <b>pine</b> <b>cone</b> powder were examined by fitting the experimental data to various model. The biosortion was described by a pseudo-second-order model predicting a chemisorption process. In addition, the equilibrium data were well characterized by the Langmuir isotherm model that confirmed the mono-layer coverage. The surface properties of raw <b>pine</b> <b>cone</b> powder and its sodium hydroxide modified form were analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). The chemical composition of <b>pine</b> <b>cone</b> powder before and after biosorption of ammonium is discussed in relation to the XRD and SEM-EDS results.

30|$|The <b>cones</b> {{of sugar}} <b>pine</b> (Pinus lambertiana Douglas) {{are among the}} largest of all conifers, {{reaching}} 56 cm long (Kinloch and Scheuner 1990). Sugar <b>pine</b> <b>cones</b> are a locally abundant component of the surface fuel bed in middle elevation mixed-conifer forests of the Sierra Nevada (Figure 1). Sugar <b>pine</b> <b>cones</b> were investigated by van Wagtendonk et al. (1998 b) and reported to have an ash free heat content of 21.82 MJ kg− 1. The burning characteristics of sugar <b>pine</b> <b>cones</b> (sensu Fonda and Varner 2004), however, are unknown. Despite their large size and local abundance, sugar <b>pine</b> <b>cones</b> remain one of the least-understood components of the surface fuel complex in Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forests.|$|R
30|$|We {{discovered}} that sugar <b>pine</b> <b>cones</b> burn with greater flame lengths and flaming times than the cones of other North American resister pines (sensu Agee 1993) studied to date. Sugar <b>pine</b> <b>cone</b> flaming times were only exceeded by the resin-coated serotinous <b>cones</b> of knobcone <b>pine</b> and Monterey pine (Fonda and Varner 2004). Sugar <b>pine</b> <b>cones</b> burned with greater flame length, flaming time, smoldering time, and mass loss than sugar pine foliage (Fonda et al. 1998), indicating that cones augment surface fire behavior of sugar pine forests, and likely do so {{to a greater}} degree than do cones of other resister pine species (Fonda 2001, Fonda and Varner 2004). Finally, we found that flammability of sugar <b>pine</b> <b>cones</b> varied dramatically and was dependent on degree of cone maturation and post-deposition decomposition. Our results indicate that the developmental stage at which cones become surface fuels and the time since deposition exert strong control over the contribution of sugar <b>pine</b> <b>cones</b> to surface fire behavior.|$|R

During the battle of Al Mansurah, an episode of the Seventh Crusade, the lord of Châteaubriant saved Louis IX of France.

30|$|Sugar <b>pine</b> <b>cones</b> {{comprised}} 1.3 % of {{the total}} forest floor fuel (duff, litter, and woody fuels < 10 cm in diameter) mass in the YFDP (Lutz et al. 2012). On sites with active frequent fire regimes, sugar <b>pine</b> <b>cones</b> may comprise a larger fraction of the surface fuel load that is {{more in line with}} their relative representation in annual litterfall inputs (up to about 10 %; Stohlgren 1988): frequent fires preclude development of a deep duff layer, which should increase the proportional representation of apparently rapidly decaying <b>pine</b> <b>cones</b> in the surface fuel bed in an active fire regime (Figure 1). In addition, fire may stimulate cone production. For example, thinning alone, and in combination with prescribed fire, increased ponderosa <b>pine</b> <b>cone</b> production (Peters and Sala 2008).|$|R
30|$|Our {{laboratory}} {{measurements of}} cone burning characteristics implicate sugar <b>pine</b> <b>cones</b> as {{contributors to the}} surface fire regime created by litterfall in Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forests (sensu Fonda and Varner 2004). Sugar <b>pine</b> <b>cones</b> burn with greater flame lengths and longer flaming times than <b>cones</b> of ponderosa <b>pine</b> and Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi Balf.), two other pine species that commonly co-occur with sugar pine. Maximum flame length and flame duration for mature sugar <b>pine</b> <b>cones</b> exceeded previously reported values for ponderosa pine and Jeffrey pine by ca. 58 cm and 120 s (Fonda and Varner 2004). The relatively greater potential contribution of sugar <b>pine</b> <b>cones</b> to surface fire behavior compared to <b>cones</b> of ponderosa <b>pine</b> and Jeffrey pine becomes more apparent when burning characteristics of cones are considered alongside those of conspecific foliage. Maximum flame lengths of ponderosa pine and Jeffrey pine needles were similar to maximum flame lengths of conspecific cones (Fonda et al. 1998). Maximum flame lengths of sugar <b>pine</b> <b>cones,</b> however, were twice that of sugar pine needles, in addition to cones having longer flaming time and smoldering time compared to needles (Fonda et al. 1998). Thus, it appears that sugar <b>pine</b> <b>cones</b> can be relatively greater contributors to surface fire behavior than <b>cones</b> of ponderosa <b>pine</b> or Jeffrey pine. By enhancing the flammability of the surface fuels, sugar <b>pine</b> <b>cones</b> may {{play an important role}} in the fuel dynamics of in mixed-conifer forests that lack a significant ponderosa pine or Jeffrey pine component, such as the YFDP.|$|R
50|$|Opportunity {{providing}} is {{a social}} learning mechanism in which the experienced individual puts the observer {{in a situation that}} facilitates the acquisition of knowledge or a new skill. A well known example of unintentional opportunity providing is the transmission of feeding behavior in black rats (Rattus rattus). One pilot study determined that black rats living in the forests of Israel preferentially fed on <b>pine</b> <b>cones</b> instead of other fresh fruits and vegetation nearby. These rats also methodically stripped <b>pine</b> <b>cones</b> rather than gnawing at them randomly. To determine how these food preferences developed, researchers provided naive adult black rats with fresh <b>pine</b> <b>cones</b> in captivity and observed their behavior. After three months of experimentation, they found that none of the rats had successfully opened the <b>pine</b> <b>cones</b> and had instead haphazardly and inefficiently attempted to feed on the cones. In further experiments, the rats were allowed to observe experienced individuals opening the <b>pine</b> <b>cones</b> but were still unable to pick up the skill of pinecone stripping. Eventually, the researchers determined that naive adult rats could learn to strip <b>pine</b> <b>cones</b> efficiently if presented with an already partially stripped cone. This is consistent with opportunity providing because experienced individuals inadvertently provide naive rats with partially stripped cones that facilitate their learning without altering the experienced rats' behavior.|$|R
