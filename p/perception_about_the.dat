They cold-called Nintendo and began work together in June 2016, prior to the Switch's announcement. Designer Greg Wohlwend saw the game as sharing classic Nintendo attributes, including a wide color palette, accessibility, and difficulty. Nintendo, at the time, was thawing its relations with indie developers by removing restrictions for development on their consoles. Wohlwend said that their partnership was positive and the port of the game's code to the Switch platform was painless. Originally planned for release in 2015, TumbleSeed was released on May 2, 2017, on Nintendo Switch, macOS, PlayStation 4, and Windows platforms. The Nintendo Switch release includes an exclusive King of the Hill-style Battle Mode.|$|E
