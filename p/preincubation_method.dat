40|$|Amoebiasis is an {{important}} public health problem in developing countries. Entamoeba histolytica, the causative agent of amoebiasis, may develop resistance to nitroimidazoles, a group of drugs {{considered to be the}} most effective against this parasitic disease. Therefore, research on new drugs for the treatment of this common infection still constitutes {{an important}} therapeutic demand. In the present study we determined the effects of a carbamate derivative, ethyl 4 -chlorophenylcarbamate (C 4), on trophozoites of E. histolytica strain HM- 1 :IMSS. C 4 was subject to various toxicity tests, including the determination of mutagenicity for bacterial DNA and changes in the enzymatic activities of eukaryotic cells. Genotoxicity studies were performed by the mutagenicity Ames test (plate incorporation and <b>preincubation</b> <b>methods)</b> with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, with or without metabolic activation produced by the S 9 fraction of rat liver. C 4 toxicity studies were performed by measuring enzymatic activity in eukaryotic cells by the 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide-formazan test with Fischer 344 rat hepatocytes. C 4 did not induce either frame-shift mutations in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium TA 97 or TA 98 or base pair substitutions in strains TA 100 and TA 102. The compound was not toxic for cultured rat hepatic cells. Trophozoites treated with 100 Î¼g of C 4 per ml were inhibited 97. 88 % at 48 h of culture; moreover, damage to the amoebae was also confirmed by electron microscopy. The antiamoebic activity of C 4 was evaluated by using an in vivo model of amoebic liver abscess in hamsters. Doses of 75 and 100 mg/ 100 g of body weight reduced the extent of the amoebic liver abscess by 84 and 94 %, respectively. These results justify further studies to clearly validate whether C 4 is a new suitable antiamoebic drug...|$|R
40|$|Background: In various {{regions of}} Brazil, {{several species of}} the genus Byrsonima (Malpighiaceae) are widely used to treat {{gastrointestinal}} complications. This genus has about 150 species of shrubs and trees distributed over the entire Neotropical region. Various biological activities {{have been identified in}} these plants, especially antioxidant, antimicrobial and topical and systemic anti-inflammatory activities. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the mutagenicity and antimutagenicity of hydroalcoholic leaf extracts of six species of Byrsonima: B. verbascifolia, B. correifolia, B. coccolobifolia, B. ligustrifolia, B. fagifolia and B. intermedia by the Salmonella microsome assay (Ames test). Methods: Mutagenic and antimutagenic activity was assessed by the Ames test, with the Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA 100, TA 98, TA 97 a and TA 102, with (+S 9) and without (-S 9) metabolization, by the <b>preincubation</b> <b>method.</b> Results: Only B. coccolobifolia and B. ligustrifolia showed mutagenic activity. However, the extracts of B. verbascifolia, B. correifolia, B. fagifolia and B. intermedia were found to be strongly antimutagenic against at least one of the mutagens tested. Conclusions: These results contribute to valuable data on the safe use of medicinal plants and their potential chemopreventive effects. Considering the excellent antimutagenic activities extracted from B. verbascifolia, B. correifolia, B. fagifolia and B. intermedia, these extracts are good candidate sources of chemopreventive agents. However, B. coccolobifolia and B. ligustrifolia showed mutagenic activity, suggesting caution in their use...|$|E

Pueraria lobata is also a phytoestrogen-rich herb traditionally used in Japan, Korea and China {{for the treatment of}} hypertension and alcoholism. We evaluated the mutagenic and antimutagenic activity of the two plant extracts using the Ames test <b>preincubation</b> <b>method</b> plus or minus the rat liver mixture S 9 for metabolic activation using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 98 and TA 100 as indicator strains. The cytotoxicity of the two extracts to the two S. typhimurium indicators was evaluated before the mutagenic and antimutagenic tests. Both extracts at a final concentration of 2. 5, 5, 10, or 20 mg/plate exhibited only mild cytotoxic effects. The plant extracts at the concentrations of 2. 5, 5 and 10 mg/plate in the presence and absence of the S 9 mixture were negative in the mutagenic Ames test. In contrast, both extracts were positive in the antimutagenic Ames test towards either {{one or both of the}} tested mutagens 2 -(2 -furyl) - 3 -(5 -nitro- 2 -furyl) -acrylamide and benzo(a) pyrene. The absence of mutagenic and the presence of anti-mutagenic activities of the two plant extracts were confirmed in rec-assays and further supported by a micronucleus test where both plant extracts at doses up to 300 mg/kg body weight (equivalent to 16 g/kg body weight plant tuberous powder) failed to exhibit significant micronucleus formation in rats. The tests confirmed the non-mutagenic but reasonably antimutagenic activities of the two plant extracts, supporting their current use as safe dietary supplements and cosmetics...|$|E
40|$|Hydroryapatite (HA) {{used for}} bone {{replacement}} {{is one of}} the most active areas of ceramic biomaterials research currently. It has been used clinically for the last 20 years due to its excellent biocompatibility, osseoconduction and osseointegration. Many modifications have been done to develop a stronger tougher and biocompatible ceramic biomaterial because pure HA is brittle. Researchers in Universiti Sains Malaysia had developed this value added HA that is stronger and less brittle compared to pure HA. The objective of this in vitro study was to evaluate the genotoxic characteristic of the value added HA based material by using Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay (Ames test). The Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay of HA was performed on Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535, TAl 537 and Eschenchia coli strain WP 2 uvrA using the <b>preincubation</b> <b>method</b> in the presence and absence of an exogenous metabolic activation system. All the bacterial tester strains treated with and without S 9 Mix showed no increase of revertant colonies with increase in concentration of test substance for both the dose finding test and the main test. The nurmber of revertant colonies was less than twice that of the solvent control for all the five bacterial strain; and this was reproducible for both the dose finding test and the main test. The numbers of revertant colonies in the negative and positive controls were within the background data of our laboratory. In conclusion the results of the tests showed that the value added HA was considered to have no reverse mutagenic potential under the present test conditions...|$|E
40|$|By osmotic lysis of pinocytic vesicles we {{were able}} to inject ricin or ricin A chain {{directly}} into the cytosol of Chinese hamster ovary cells. The lag time of 1 to 2 h before the onset of the inhibition of protein synthesis by ricin in intact cells was reduced to 15 to 30 min by this <b>method.</b> <b>Preincubation</b> of cells with a low concentration of nigericin, which was shown earlier to enhance the cytotoxicity of ricin, had no effect under this condition. Direct transfer of either intact ricin or the ricin A subunit by osmotic lysis of pinocytic vesicles into the cytosol of the ricin-resistant CHO mutant cell line 4 - 10 rendered the mutant 4 - 10 cells as sensitive to ricin as the CHO pro wild-type cells. Both the lag time and the rate of inhibition of protein synthesis in the wild-type and mutant cell lines after the introduction of ricin by osmotic lysis of pinocytic vesicles were the same. These results indicate that injection of ricin into the cytosol by osmotic lysis of pinosomes bypasses the internalization defect in the mutant cell line...|$|R
40|$|Radioimmunoassay (RIA) for the {{determination}} of plasma secretin was investigated fundamentally and was clinically applied for the examination of secretin release {{in response to an}} intraduodenal acid infusion. The secretin RIA was finally established by use of anti-porcine secretin rabbit serum, 125 (125 ãã) I labelled 6 -tyrosyl secretin as a tracer hormone, and Squibb's synthetic secretin as the standard hormone. We devised a way to the incubation of a two step <b>method</b> namely, <b>preincubation</b> and postincubation <b>method,</b> and to a single antibody method by means of polyethyleneglycol. The measurable lowest limit of this RIA was 100 pg/ml of secretin. In clinical investigations, basal plasma immunoreactive secretin levels before intraduodenal acidification in 13 out of 15 control patients were less than the measurable limit and the mean was 109 pg/ml when the value less than 100 pg/ml was used for tentative calculations as 100 pg/ml. However, the mean values calculated as before showed increases after intraduodenal acidification to 243. 5 pg/ml at 5 minutes, 397. 7 pg/ml after 10 minutes indicating the maximum, 217. 3 pg/ml at 20 minutes, and 126. 7 pg/ml at 30 minutes. In patients with chronic pancreatitis, the secretin level prior to acidification showed more than 100 pg/ml in 4 out of 5 cases with a mean of 180 pg/ml, while the secretin releasing responses to the acidification were remarkably lower than the control, and the responses were also impaired in case of diabetes mellitus showing intermediate levels between chronic pancreatitis and the control. On the other hand, the responses of secretin release to duodenal acidification in patients with duodenal ulcer were lower and the delay of appearance of the peak was noted. It was suggested from the above descrived results that the secretin release was also impaired in duodenal ulcer in spite of the hypersecretion of gastric acid...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Context: Urtica dioica L. (Urticaceae), {{stinging}} nettle, {{has been}} {{employed as a}} folklore remedy for {{a wide spectrum of}} ailments, including urinary disorders, prostatic hyperplasia, and liver diseases. It has been also used traditionally for cancer treatment. Object: To evaluate the potential chemopreventive properties of a protein fraction from the aerial part of Urtica dioica (namely UDHL 30). Materials and methods: UDHL 30 has been tested for the antimutagenic activity in bacteria (50 - 800 [*]Î¼g/plate; Ames test by the <b>preincubation</b> <b>method)</b> and for the cytotoxicity on human hepatoma HepG 2 cells (0. 06 - 2 [*]mg/mL; 24 and 48 [*]h incubation). Moreover, the antioxidant activity of UDHL 30 (0. 1 - 1200 [*]Î¼g/mL; ABTS and superoxide-radical scavenger assays) was evaluated as potential protective mechanisms. Results: UDHL 30 was not cytotoxic on HepG 2 cells up to 2 [*]mg/mL; conversely, it exhibited a strong antimutagenic activity against the mutagen 2 -aminoanthracene (2 AA) in all strains tested (maximum inhibition of 56, 78, and 61 % in TA 98, TA 100, and WP 2 uvrA strains, respectively, at 800 [*]Î¼g/plate). In addition, a remarkable scavenging activity against ABTS radical and superoxide anion (IC 50 values of 19. 9 [*]Â±[*] 1. 0 [*]Î¼g/mL and 75. 3 [*]Â±[*] 0. 9 [*]Î¼g/mL, respectively) was produced. Discussion and conclusions: UDHL 30 possesses antimutagenic and radical scavenging properties. Being 2 AA a pro-carcinogenic agent, we hypothesize that the antimutagenicity of UDHL 30 can be due to the inhibition of CYP 450 -isoenzymes, involved in the mutagen bioactivation. The radical scavenger ability could contribute to 2 AA-antimutagenicity. These data encourage further studies in order to better define the potential usefulness of UDHL 30 in chemoprevention...|$|E
40|$|Background: Crotalaria pallida Ailton is a plant {{belonging}} to the Fabaceae family, popularly known as rattle or rattlesnake and used in traditional medicine to treat swelling of the joints and as a vermifuge. Previous pharmacological studies have also reported anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antifungal activities. Nevertheless, scientific information regarding this species is scarce, {{and there are no}} reports related to its possible estrogenic and mutagenic effects. Thus, {{the purpose of the present}} study was to investigate the estrogenic potential of C. pallida leaves by means of the Recombinant Yeast Assay (RYA), seeking an alternative for estrogen replacement therapy during menopause; and to reflect on the safe use of natural products to assess the mutagenic activity of the crude extract from C. pallida leaves, the dichloromethane fraction and stigmasterol by means of the Ames test. Methods: The recombinant yeast assay with the strain BY 4741 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was performed with the ethanolic extract, dichloromethane fraction and stigmasterol isolated from the leaves of C. pallida. Mutagenic activity was evaluated by the Salmonella/microsome assay (Ames test), using the Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA 100, TA 98, TA 97 and TA 102, with (+S 9) and without (-S 9) metabolization, by the <b>preincubation</b> <b>method.</b> Results: All samples showed estrogenic activity, mainly stigmasterol. The ethanolic extract from C. pallida leaves showed mutagenic activity in the TA 98 strain (-S 9), whereas dichloromethane fraction and stigmasterol were found devoid of activity. Conclusion: Considering the excellent estrogenic activity performed by stigmasterol in the RYA associated with the absence of mutagenic activity when evaluated by the Ames test, stigmasterol becomes a strong candidate to be used in hormone replacement therapy during menopause.

40|$|Ethnopharmacological relevance: The {{aerial parts}} of Sisymbrium officinale Scop. are {{commonly}} used to treat airway ailments, moreover in antiquity the herbal drug was reputed to possess anticancer properties. The results obtained in present work support the traditional use and the properties ascribed to Sisymbrium officinale. Aim of the study: In order to give a scientific basis to the traditional uses of Sisymbrium officinale, this study was aimed to evaluate in vitro the myorelaxant activity, the antimicrobial properties and the antimutagenic effect of an aqueous dry extract of the aerial parts of the plant. A phytochemical characterization of the extract was also performed. Materials and methods: The myorelaxant activity was studied against the contractions induced by carbachol, histamine and leukotriene C(4), in isolated guinea-pig trachea. The antimicrobial activity was tested against six bacteria and one yeast. The Ames test, performed by the <b>preincubation</b> <b>method,</b> was used to study the antimutagenic activity of the extract by its capability to inhibit the mutagenic effect of 2 -nitrofluorene, sodium azide, methyl methanesulfonate and 2 -aminoanthracene, in Salmonella typhimurium TA 98, Salmonella typhimurium TA 100 and Escherichia coli WP 2 uvrA strains. The chemical composition of the extract was analyzed by TLC and HPLC. Results: Sisymbrium officinale showed to reduce the chemically-induced contractions of isolated guinea-pig trachea with major potency against leukotriene C(4) and histamine. The extract did not show any antibacterial activity. The Ames test showed a strong antimutagenic activity against 2 -aminoanthracene, in Escherichia coli WP 2 uvrA and in Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 strains. The phytochemical study highlighted the presence of putranjivine, the glucosinolate marker of Sisymbrium officinale, and of proline. Conclusions: The myorelaxant activity of Sisymbrium officinale offers a scientific basis to its use in traditional medicine. The strong antimutagenic effect suggests further studies to evaluate its possible chemopreventive activity...|$|E

This study was conducted to compare the mutagenicity of mainstream whole-smoke (WS) and wet total particulate matter (WTPM) from two sets of experimental cigarettes to determine if menthol has an effect on this endpoint. The first pair of experimental cigarettes (delivering ~ 6 mg WTPM / cig) included a mentholated (0. 6 % w/w menthol) and a comparable non-mentholated control. The second set consisted of four experimental cigarettes (delivering ~ 9 mg WTPM / cig) with increasing levels of menthol (0. 1 %- 0. 7 % w/w) and a non-mentholated control. Within each set, the cigarettes were comparable in construction, composition, and WTPM deliveries with added menthol spanning typical user levels. All cigarettes were smoked under ISO puff profile (35 mL volume, 2 second duration and 1 minute interval) on a VITROCELL Â® VC 10 smoking robot, with WTPM being pad collected and extracted in dimethylsulfoxide. TA 98 and TA 100 were exposed to WS or WTPM with metabolic activation (S 9 +) utilizing either the VITROCELL Â® Ames exposure modules and whole-smoke (WS) dilution system or the <b>preincubation</b> <b>method</b> (WTPM). The WS specific activity (revertants / Âµg) from the first pair of sample cigarettes showed the mentholated cigarette had significantly lower activity then the non-mentholated control (TA 98, p = 0. 0027; TA 100, p = 0. 0297). For the second set of cigarettes, only small differences in WS activities were observed, with a trend of decreasing activity with increasing menthol that was not statistically significant. No differences were detected for WTPM specific activities. No significant differences in WS activities occurred when cigarettes were removed from packs and conditioned (18 hours, 23 Â°C, 60 % RH) prior to smoking. With no changes in smoke delivery or cytotoxicity and with the reduction of menthol from the tobacco during conditioning, these results suggest menthol may have a role in the observed reduction of WS Ames activity...|$|E
