500|$|Thompson {{first met}} Janet Reno in November 1975, when {{he applied for}} {{a job as an}} {{assistant}} state's attorney in Miami-Dade County, Florida, but was not hired. In 1988, he ran for prosecutor against then-incumbent Dade County State Attorney Janet Reno, after she had declined his request to prosecute Neil Rogers. Thompson gave Reno a letter at a campaign event requesting that she check a box to indicate whether she was homosexual, bisexual, or heterosexual. Thompson said that Reno then <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his shoulder and responded, [...] "I'm only interested in virile men. Thatâ€™s why I'm not attracted to you." [...] He filed a police report accusing her of battery for touching him. In response, Reno asked Florida governor Bob Martinez to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate. The special prosecutor rejected the charge, concluding that it was [...] "a political ploy". Reno was ultimately re-elected with 69% of the vote. Thompson repeated allegations that Reno was a lesbian when she was nominated as U.S. Attorney General, leading one of her supporters, lieutenant governor Buddy MacKay, to dismiss him as a [...] "kook".|$|E
2500|$|Some {{scholars}} {{believe that}} Sophocles' Tereus {{was influenced by}} Euripides' Medea, and thus must have been produced after 431. [...] However, this is not certain and any influence {{may well have been}} in the opposite direction, with Sophocles' play influencing Euripides. [...] Jenny Marsh believes that Euripides' Medea did come before Sophocles' Tereus, based primarily on a statement in Euripides' chorus [...] "I have heard of only one woman, only one of all that have lived, who <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> her own children: Ino." [...] Marsh takes this to imply that as of the time of Medeas production, the myth of Tereus had not yet incorporated the infanticide, as it did in Sophocles' play.|$|E

60|$|She <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> my mouth, {{and stopped}} me before I could say any more.|$|E

60|$|George gave a cry and {{sinking into}} a chair, burst into tears. Lucy <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|Nevertheless, {{he showed}} the signs of thought, and badly; for after dinner Sylvia, <b>putting</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his forehead, said: ...|$|R
