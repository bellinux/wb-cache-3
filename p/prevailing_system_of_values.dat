40|$|In {{this paper}} the term ‘globalisation’ means the {{international}} integration of nationally organised markets {{in conjunction with}} increasing cross-country flows of factors of production. According to this globalisation has been under way for centuries. Globalisation is not a completely autonomous, not even a solely market driven process. Historically, {{it is for the}} most part determined by decisions of nation states. In times of globalisation speeding up, typically social and political debates start about the driving forces, extent and impact of globalisation. Already two centuries ago, globalisation has been discussed in a similar way as today. Initially, there is a debate about the organisation of the foreign trade regime. Because change of social and economic structures {{is an integral part of}} globalisation, the debate about the impact of structural change is constituent in globalisation discourses. Winners and losers of the structural change try to improve their social position through foreign trade policy. These two levels of globalisation discourses are usually distorted by the argument that globalisation and the induced change of societal structures provoke adverse effects on the <b>prevailing</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>values.</b> Because of this the globalisation discourse becomes a matter of emotion and disproportionately complex. The paper demonstrates the three levels of a typical globalisation discourse by using three examples. First, the actual globalisation discourse will be discussed. Second, in Germany at the beginning of the 20 th century globalisation has been hotly debated under the heading “agrarian versus industrial state”. Third, the typical globalisation discourse can also be outlined by the dispute about the reform policy in Prussia in the early 19 th century. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} the organisational field of general dental practice and how agents change or maintain the institution <b>of</b> <b>values</b> {{associated with the}} everyday work of health care provision. Our dataset comprise archival literature and policy documents, interview data from field level actors, as well as service delivery level interview data and secondary data gathered (2011 – 12) from 16 English dental practices. Our analysis provides a typology <b>of</b> institutional logics (<b>prevailing</b> <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>value)</b> experienced {{in the field of}} dental practice. Confirming current literature, we find two logics dominate how care is assessed: business-like health care and medical professionalism. We advance the literature by finding the business-like health care logic further distinguished by <b>values</b> <b>of</b> commercialism {{on the one hand and}} those of accountability and procedural diligence on the other. The logic of professionalism we also find is further distinguished into a commitment to clinical expertise and independence in delivering patient care on the one hand, and concerns for the autonomy and sustainability of a business enterprise on the other...|$|R

Secondary data was collected for the years 1974 and 2004 from the General Social Survey. 12 variables were used for analysis (2 Dependent: Ideal Number of Children and Actual Number of Children, and 10 Independent: Years of Education, Total Family Income (1974 and 2004), Country of Family Origin, Religious Preference, Strength of Affiliation, Political Ideology, Region, Size of Place (in thousands), and Type of Place resided at age 16), and grouped into cultural, socio-economic, and geographic categories. The data was analyzed using a Poisson Log-Linear Regression analysis. Frequency analysis of the two dependent variables suggests a decrease in ideal family size as well as a decrease in larger (3 to 8 + children) families. Regression analysis suggests a decrease in the influence of geographic factors between 1974 and 2004, as well as a consistent influence of socio-economic factors on actual family size. Cultural factors (specifically related to religion) were influential on both dependent variables for the two different years...|$|R

2500|$|Peter Singer's 1975 book Animal Liberation critiqued anthropocentrism and put {{the case}} for animals to be given moral consideration.

However, Singer has disagreed with deep ecology's belief in the intrinsic <b>value</b> <b>of</b> nature separate from questions of suffering, taking a more utilitarian stance. The feminist and civil rights movements also brought about expansion <b>of</b> the ethical <b>system</b> for their particular domains. Likewise deep ecology brought the whole of nature under moral consideration.

40|$|We {{compare the}} <b>prevailing</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> {{compulsory}} pre-merger notification with the Australian <b>system</b> <b>of</b> voluntary pre-merger notification. It is shown that, for a non-trivial set <b>of</b> parameter <b>values,</b> a perfect Bayesian equilibrium exists in mixed strategies {{in which the}} regulator investigates un-notified mergers with probability less than one and the parties choose notification with probability less than one. Thanks to the signaling opportunity that arises when notification is voluntary, voluntary notification leads to lower enforcement costs for the regulator and lower notification costs for the merging parties. Some of the theoretical predictions are supported by exploratory empirical tests using merger data from Australia. Overall, our results suggest that voluntary merger notification may achieve objectives similar to those achieved by compulsory systems at lower costs to the merging parties {{as well as to}} the regulator. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{political}} and social theory, accelerationism {{is the idea that}} either the <b>prevailing</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> capitalism, or certain technosocial processes that have historically characterised it, should be expanded, repurposed, or accelerated in order to generate radical social change. Some contemporary accelerationist philosophy takes as its starting point the Deleuzo-Guattarian theory of deterritorialisation, aiming to identify, deepen, and radicalise the forces of deterritorialisation with a view to overcoming the countervailing tendencies that suppress the possibility of far-reaching social transformation. Accelerationism may also refer more broadly, and usually pejoratively, to support for the deepening of capitalism in the belief that this will hasten its self-destructive tendencies and ultimately lead to its collapse.|$|R
