40|$|Crystallization of pure <b>Pentaerythritol</b> <b>Tetralaurate</b> (PETD) {{can be done}} {{by using}} melt {{crystallization}} technique. PETD is important chemical used as an essential varnish additive in magnetic wire production and has high demand in Malaysia industry such as Kaneka Chemical. The technology to crystallize PETD has not been localized yet, and study the characteristic of PETD crystal will help industry to store this chemical. PETD is a new chemical produced for {{a few years ago and}} the physical property of PETD has not known, made the crystallization process more difficult to handle because of this lack of knowledge. In this study, the melt crystallization technique was used for pure substance crystallization. The crystallization process used temperature as the parameter to study their time of crystallization. The crystals that had been produced then were analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The SEM micrograph can view the crystals size at magnifier 120 and 200. The result from SEM showed the topography and morphology of PETD crystal which direct water contact cooling method gave circle shape crystal and non-direct water contact cooling method had the crystal shape looked like it container...|$|E
