500|$|Like {{many other}} U2 songs, [...] "City of Blinding Lights" [...] can be {{interpreted}} in a religious manner. Author Cameron Conant related the opening verse to the doubt he felt about his convictions on politics, marriage, and faith as he aged, concluding that a person's confidence in their beliefs makes {{it seem as if}} they know more than they do. Music critic Bill Friskics-Warren felt that the final line, [...] "Blessings not just for the ones who kneel, luckily", was a way for Bono to berate himself for not praying enough, and was an attack on Christianity because [...] "faith often perpetuates the misery and divisiveness that he decries." [...] Steve Stockman, a chaplain at Queen's University of Belfast, believed the song was a metaphor for growing up, and that the final line meant that not just <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> could be blessed.|$|E

Mac Powell's vocal range spans from the low note of B3 to the high note of F5. The lyrics to the song {{have been described as}} being from the perspective of God, although the members of Third Day have described them differently; David Carr, the drummer for Third Day, described the lyrics as [...] "crying out to God and calling out his name", while Mac Powell described them as [...] "kind of a prayer. It's about when people are going through hard times and going through struggles that we've gotta call out to someone, and for us as <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> it's calling out to God and hearing his voice... and for someone else it could be a friend or a family member that you've gotta reach out to kind of help share those burdens you go through". Carr also described the drum part on [...] "Call My Name" [...] as [...] "basic", and the song itself has been described as [...] "pop rock", [...] "AC-friendly", and [...] "pop".|$|E
500|$|Despite many {{explicit}} {{allusions to}} several world religions, Ingrid Reichel {{states that the}} novel is a book for “readers with humor, for reasoners (…), for darwinists, on no account for creationists, {{to a lesser extent}} for <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith,</b> but rather for atheists, … and fundamentalists drop out entirely”. Another aspect is identified by Karin Gayer when pinpointing the parallel evolution of the patriarchal hierarchy in the narrated society and the alluded social matriarchy, the first resembling chimpanzee communities and the second representing those of bonobos. In addition, she points out the strength of the women characters. She declares {{that at the time of}} the Australopithecus, neither chimpanzees nor bonobos existed, but [...] "the author is not interested in paleoanthropologic precisenesses—he is interested in mirroring our society, in exposing human behavior". She compares Costello with the alpha of a community of chimpanzees and a classical manager, and Akshaya with bonobo females and a modern-day career woman. With regard to these underlying comparisons, Gayer says, [...] "On another level we are struck by the permanent notional commingling of the simian and the human, a composition which leaves us pensive and asks the legitimate question where we, who consider ourselves sapiens in a double sense, should finally classify man." ...|$|E
