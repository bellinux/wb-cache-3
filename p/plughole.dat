5|$|Series 6 {{began on}} 26 September 1998 and {{began with the}} leprechaun Mr Onion being {{temporarily}} written out of the show after supposedly being swept down the <b>plughole</b> in the bath. This was done intentionally as puppeteer John Eccleston was in Australia filming for Farscape for the year {{and would not be}} available. To compensate for Eccleston's absence, a new leprechaun puppet was added called 'Shamrock' (voiced by Rebecca Nagan of Rosie and Jim fame) who made her debut {{at the end of the}} first show as their long lost sister. She then became a regular fixture from the following week and performed alongside Mr Sage for the rest of the series as a replacement to Mr Onion.|$|E
5|$|The {{seasonal}} frosting {{of areas}} near the southern ice cap {{results in the}} formation of transparent 1-metre-thick slabs of dry ice above the ground. With the arrival of spring, sunlight warms the subsurface and pressure from subliming CO2 builds up under a slab, elevating and ultimately rupturing it. This leads to geyser-like eruptions of CO2 gas mixed with dark basaltic sand or dust. This process is rapid, observed happening {{in the space of a}} few days, weeks or months, a rate of change rather unusual in geology – especially for Mars. The gas rushing underneath a slab to the site of a geyser carves a spiderweb-like pattern of radial channels under the ice, the process being the inverted equivalent of an erosion network formed by water draining through a single <b>plughole.</b>|$|E
25|$|Several undeveloped caves are {{available}} for adventure caving (2 hours to all-day tours). These adventure caving tours include the <b>Plughole</b> Tour, which runs daily and includes basic abseiling. Other more challenging adventure caving tours {{are available}}.|$|E
500|$|In 2002 the {{accommodation}} in {{the tower}} was criticised - partly due to overcrowding, but also regarding {{the state of the}} building itself, with damp wardrobes, rusty bath <b>plugholes,</b> stained baths and generally [...] "damp and squalid conditions". The complex was last used for student accommodation in 2005.|$|R
50|$|The ‘Runzknecht’ {{ensures the}} {{distribution}} of water. 142 brass valves 35 help the regulation, through which the water can also be turned off during the cleaning of the Bächle. Furthermore, there are <b>plugholes</b> on the bases of the Bächle, which connect the Bächle water systems with the central sewerage system into which the water drains. 15 overflow thresholds in the sewers or the industrial stream prevent basements being flooded {{with high levels of}} water 15.|$|R
40|$|ASHRAE (899 -RP), the National Research Council of Canada used {{full-scale}} {{physical model}} studies combined with CFD modeling {{to investigate the}} effectiveness of mechanical smoke exhaust systems used for atrium smoke management.

In this paper,the research resultsare used to investigate the impact on smoke venting of the ceiling jet formed when the plume impinges on the ceiling. Also, algebraic equations and a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model were used to estimate smoke properties in the smoke layer. The numerical results are compared with the experimental results...|$|R
25|$|The {{reason for}} this is that human {{activities}} are adding CO2 to the atmosphere faster than natural processes can remove it (see carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere for a complete explanation). This is analogous to a flow of water into a bathtub. So long as the tap runs water (analogous to the emission of carbon dioxide) into the tub faster than water escapes through the <b>plughole</b> (the natural removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere), then the level of water in the tub (analogous to the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere) will continue to rise.|$|E
500|$|Distribution {{rights for}} the United States were picked up at Sundance by IFC Films. Trinity Filmed Entertainment was the British distributor. The film was {{released}} in the United States and the United Kingdom on 24 September 2010. In both these countries, the film was distributed without the seventh of its nine reels. The running time was therefore 137 minutes at 25 frames per second, which the director had instructed that the film should be played at, or 142 minutes at the more common 24 frames per second. Noé says {{that none of the}} cut material is essential for the film. He describes it as [...] "some astro-visions, an orgy scene with Linda and the Japanese girl, the scene where you see [...] waking up at the morgue and he thinks he's alive but he's not, and then the camera goes down the <b>plughole</b> where she's tipping his ashes." [...] The reason the shorter version was made was that Noé had promised the investors to make an alternative edit if the film ended up being longer than two hours and 20 minutes. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in France on 1 December 2010. Each edition features both the complete version and the shorter cut.|$|E

50|$|Some modern plugholes {{dispense}} {{with the need}} for a separate plug, having instead a built-in 'pop-up plug' operated by a handle on the sink, that can move up or down to open or close the <b>plughole.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Some {{critics have}} argued that all forms of posthumanism, {{including}} transhumanism, {{have more in common}} than their respective proponents realize.

50|$|The Doctor and Susan scale a {{drainpipe}} to {{gain access}} to the house and locate their friends, braving the height as they go. Meanwhile, Ian and Barbara examine the laboratory and encounter a giant fly, which is killed instantly when it contacts sample seeds that had been sprayed with DN6. Barbara foolishly touched one seed earlier and soon starts to feel unwell. Nevertheless, attracted by Susan’s voice in the reverberating <b>plughole,</b> the four friends are reunited.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the player}} {{arrives at a}} {{location}} known as [...] "Y2", the player may (with 25% probability) receive the message [...] "A hollow voice says 'PLUGH'." [...] This magic word takes the player between the rooms [...] "inside building" [...] and [...] "Y2". A popular {{theory is that the}} word is short for [...] "plughole" [...] (allegedly a caver term) but no evidence supports this claim, and the game does not feature a <b>plughole</b> in this location.|$|E
5000|$|In 1977, Walker {{described}} the party's membership as being [...] "like a bath with both taps running and the <b>plughole</b> empty. Members pour in and pour out." [...] Fielding echoed this, {{stating that the}} NF's [...] "stable membership" [...] was lower {{than the number of}} people who have [...] "passed through" [...] it. Thurlow noted that even at its peak in the 1970s, the Front's membership was still only half the size of that of the British Union of Fascists during their 1930s heyday.|$|E
50|$|McCorkell {{was born}} on 18 September 1921 in the Indian hill station of Ootacamund, the second {{daughter}} of Lieutenant-Colonel E.B. Booth DSO, RAMC, who was serving in India after the First World War (during which he had met and married Aileen's mother, a nurse). Her obituary noted that “Aileen had no memories of India, but a lifelong fear of snakes was reliably attributed to an incident in her infancy when a cobra came up through the bath’s <b>plughole,</b> only to be quickly dispatched by a capable ayah with a meat cleaver”.|$|E

5000|$|As social {{activities}} became more important, a Drama Society {{was founded in}} 1959 which continues to operate to this day. Throughout this period Charity week stunts gained press attention following [...] "Screams, roaring rockets, explosions and shouts for help." [...] In 1959 students built a motorized cast-iron bath which they named 'Sambo'. In 1961 they successfully drove it from John O'Groats in Scotland to Land's End in Cornwall, albeit with a slight mishap on the A6 near Penrith where they scraped the sides of two cars standing at traffic lights. Despite the evasive action taken by bath-driver Peter Lackenby; villagers crowded round as two police motor patrolmen, summoned {{to the scene of}} the collision, checked the bath’s controls, which included motor cycle handlebars, brakes, a horn, windshield, as well as the more usual fittings of <b>plughole</b> and hot and cold taps! The students successfully completed the journey and earned international notoriety as they raised £1000 for the British Empire Cancer Research Fund (almost £18,000 in 2014).|$|E
5000|$|Ned gets Ralph {{to ride a}} {{clockwork}} {{car with}} a cannon. As Ralph prepares to fire the cannon on the cat, the cat backfires the cannon on Ralph, forcing Ralph to retreat. Next Ralph paints so-called invisible ink (water) on Ned convincing him he is invisible. Ned confidently walks past the cat plucking a whisker. When Ned returns, he has eaten the cake {{he was supposed to}} bring. Ralph getting impatient has Ned paint him with [...] "invisible ink" [...] and Ralph goes to towards the fridge only to be massacred by the cat. Next Ned launches Ralph from a champagne bottle cork right into the cat's mouth and through his tail right over to the fridge, but the cat forces Ralph to retreat again. Both mice lure the cat on to the sink so that they can put his tail down the <b>plughole.</b> Then they activate the disposal pipe causing the cat to lose much of his fur and giving the mice the chance to take a cupcake from the fridge.|$|E

After discussing the criticism this article describes the work of the medical audit advisory group in Manchester.

40|$|The heart {{acts as a}} pump pushing blood {{round the}} body, which {{supplies}} oxygen and nutrients to all cells and removes waste products. The average adult has about eight pints of blood which the heart continuously circulates by beating around 100, 000 times a day. The heart and the blood vessels (arteries, veins and capillaries) make up our circulatory system called the cardiovascular system. How Does CVD Happen? CVD (such as heart disease and stroke) occurs {{when there is a}} build up of fatty deposits (plaques) on the inside walls of the arteries. These plaques can clog up the arteries making them narrower and restricting the blood flow {{in the same way that}} sewerage pipes get blocked when people pour animal fat down the <b>plughole!</b> Reduced blood flow to the heart can then lead to chest pain and discomfort (angina).

40|$|The {{proposed}} work is {{a prediction}} of the propagation of seismic waves induced by the cultivation of quarries {{through the use of}} explosives. The paper is divided in two different stages: first of all it is necessary to choose, among the various explosives for industrial use and all possible blasting designs, the one with which {{it would be possible to}} get an embraceable result from the industrial point of view and with the minimal possible forecasted disturbance for the buildings present in the surrounding areas (receptors); as a second step it was found, with the simulations, the indicative values (for different distances) for the peak particle velocity (PPV - peak particle velocity). In order to work with the values as real as possible, we used the data contained in a draft E. I. A. (Environmental Impact Assessment) of the Lazio Region, regarding the project of a quarry. The optimal blasting design choice was made considering that a substantial amount of the work has to be spent at the foot of each blastholes; therefore, we considered two different types of <b>plughole,</b> one obtained with two different diameters of drilling (the larger for the lower portion of the blasthole) containing only one type of explosive, and another one having the same diameter along its entire length, but containing two different types of explosives [...] . Obtained the mine parameters (blasting design), the peak particle velocity (PPV) and its trend was determined, assuming an exponential decaying of the mathematical function f[*]=[*]PPV(t). At the conclusion of the paper “iso[*]−[*]PPV” maps were created regarding the quarry adjacent area [...] ...|$|E
