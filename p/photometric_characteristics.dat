For larger projects or those with irregular floor plans, lighting design software can be used. Each fixture has its location entered, and the reflectance of walls, ceiling, and floors can be entered. The computer program will then produce a set of contour charts overlaid on the project floor plan, showing the light level to be expected at the working height. More advanced programs can include the effect of light from windows or skylights, allowing further optimization of the operating cost of the lighting installation. The amount of daylight received in an internal space can typically be analyzed by undertaking a daylight factor calculation.|$|E

Here, we analyze the multi-band light curves and extensive spectroscopic coverage of a sample of 35 SNe II and find that 11 of them could be SNe II-L. The spectra of these SNe are hydrogen de-ficient, typically have shallow Hα absorption, may show indirect signs of helium via strong O I λ 7774 absorption, and have faster line velocities consistent with a thin hydrogen shell. The light curves can be mostly differentiated from those of the regular, hydrogen-rich SNe II-P by their steeper decline rates and higher luminosity, and we propose as a defining <b>photometric</b> <b>characteristic</b> the decline in the V band: SNe II-L seem to decline by more than 0. 5 mag from peak brightness by day 50 after explosion.

40|$|In this work, the {{influence}} of oxygen partial pressure on structural, morphological, and optical properties of TiO 2 thin films grown on fused quartz substrate at different oxygen partial pressure by pulsed laser deposition were examined. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns show the formation of TiO 2 anatase phase deposited at high oxygen pressure. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) reveals that surface roughness of the films increases with oxygen pressure. Variation of surface morphology of films with increasing oxygen partial pressure was studied by AFM. It is observed that energy band gap of the films increases from 3. 27 eV to 3. 52 eV {{with the increase of}} oxygen pressure and is attributed to the decrease of oxygen defects. TiO 2 thin films exhibited blue emission under the excitation of 320 nm wavelength. De-convoluted photoluminescence (PL) peaks showed that defect states are responsible for visible emission in TiO 2 thin films. The intensity of PL emission associated with oxygen vacancies decreases with increasing oxygen pressure. <b>Photometric</b> <b>characteristic</b> analysis shows that the films deposited 1 x 10 - 4 mbar oxygen pressure exhibited intense blue emission with high luminescence efficacy of radiation.

40|$|During {{photometric}} measurements involving {{the use of}} photometric lamps {{it is necessary that}} the filament of lamp takes a strictly predetermined position with respect to the photodetector and the optical axis of the photometric setup. The errors in positioning of alignment filament with respect to the optical axis of the measuring system lead to increase the uncertainty of measurement of the <b>photometric</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the light sources. A typical method for alignment of filament of photometric lamps is based on the use a diopter tubes (telescopes). Using this method, the mounting of filament to the required position is carried out by successive approximations, which requires special concentration and a lot of time. The aim of this work is to develop an apparatus for alignment which allows simultaneous alignment of the filament of lamps in two mutually perpendicular planes.

40|$|Variations in the {{photometric}} {{parameters of}} stellar systems {{as a function}} of their evolution and the stellar populations comprising them are investigated. A set of seven evolutionary models with an exponential decrease in the star-formation rate and 672 models with a secondary burst of star formation are considered. The occurrence of a secondary burst of star formation can shift the position of a stellar system on two-color diagrams to the right or left of the normal color sequence for galaxies and the extinction line. This makes it possible to estimate the composition of the stellar population of a galaxy with a nonmonotonic star formation history from its position on two-color diagrams. Surface photometry in both the optical (UBVRI) and near-IR (JHK) is used to study the stellar populations and star-formation histories in the structural components (nucleus, bulge, disk, spiral arms, bar, ring) of 26 galaxies of various morphological types (from S 0 to Sd). Components (nucleus, bulge, bar) with color characteristics corresponding to stellar systems with secondary bursts of star formation are indicated in 10 of the 26 galaxies. The parameters of these secondary bursts are estimated. Five of the 10 galaxies with complex star-formation histories display clear structural perturbations. Appreciable differences in the <b>photometric</b> <b>characteristics</b> of relatively red early-type galaxies (S 0 -Sb) and relatively blue later-type galaxies (Sb-Sd) have been found.
