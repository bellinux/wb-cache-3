5|$|The {{emission}} {{of dust and}} particles could have covered the entire surface of the Earth for several years, possibly a decade, creating a harsh environment for living things.

Using conventional non-phylogenetic and phylogenetic generalized least-squares approaches, we found no support for a relationship between BMR and NPP, despite including species captured throughout the world in environments spanning a 35 -fold range in NPP.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between primary and bacterial production in two dimictic Indiana lakes with different <b>primary</b> <b>productivities</b> was examined {{during the summer}} stratification period in 1982. Primary production rates were calculated from rates of H 14 CO 3 − incorporation by natural samples, and bacterial production was calculated from rates of [3 H-methyl]thymidine incorporation by natural samples. Both vertical and seasonal distributions of bacterial production in the more productive lake (Little Crooked Lake) were strongly influenced by primary production. A lag of about 2 weeks between a burst in primary production and the subsequent response in bacterial production was observed. The vertical distribution of bacterial production {{in the water column}} of the less productive lake (Crooked Lake) was determined by the vertical distribution of primary production, but no clear {{relationship between}} seasonal maxima of primary and bacterial production in this lake was observed. High rates of bacterial production in Crooked Lake during May indicate the importance of allochthonous carbon washed in by spring rains. Bacterial production accounted for 30. 6 and 31. 8 % of total (primary plus bacterial) production in Crooked Lake and Little Crooked Lake, respectively, from April through October. High rates of bacterial production during late September and October were observed in both lakes. Calculation of the fraction of bacterial production supported by phytoplankton excretion implies an important role for other mechanisms of supplying carbon, such as phytoplankton autolysis.

40|$|The study compiles the {{controlling}} factors for organic matter sedimentation patterns from {{a suite of}} organogeochemical parameters in surface sediments off Spitsbergen and direct seabed observations using a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV). In addition we assess its storage rates {{as well as the}} potential of carbon sinks on the northwestern margin of the Barents Sea with short sediment cores from a selected fjord environment (Storfjord). While sedimentation in the fjords is mainly controlled by river/meltwater discharge and coastal erosion by sea ice/glaciers resulting in high supply of terrigenous organic matter, Atlantic water inflow, and thus enhanced marine organic matter supply, characterizes the environment on the outer shelf and slope. Local deviations from this pattern, particularly on the shelf, are due to erosion and out washing of fine-grained material by bottom currents. Spots dominated by marine productivity close to the island have been found at the outer Isfjord and west off Prins Karls Forland as well as off the Kongsfjord/Krossfjord area and probably reflect local upwelling of nutrient-rich Atlantic water-derived water masses. Accumulation rates of marine organic carbon as well as reconstructed <b>primary</b> <b>productivities</b> decreased since the middle of the last century. Negative correlation of the Isfjord temperature record with reconstructed productivities in the Storfjord could be explained by a reduced annual duration of the marginal ice zone in the area due to global warming.

25|$|The {{sequence}} of events leading to anoxic oceans may have been triggered by carbon dioxide emissions from the eruption of the Siberian Traps. In that scenario, warming from the enhanced greenhouse effect would reduce the solubility of oxygen in seawater, causing the concentration of oxygen to decline. Increased weathering of the continents due to warming and the acceleration of the water cycle would increase the riverine flux of phosphate to the ocean. The phosphate would have supported greater <b>primary</b> <b>productivity</b> in the surface oceans. The increase in organic matter production would have caused more organic matter to sink into the deep ocean, where its respiration would further decrease oxygen concentrations. Once anoxia became established, {{it would have been}} sustained by a positive feedback loop because deep water anoxia tends to increase the recycling efficiency of phosphate, leading to even higher productivity.|$|E
25|$|In salt marshes, early ecologists like Eugene Odum and John Teal {{sparked the}} current {{bottom-up}} paradigm in ecology through work on Sapelo Island, GA (U.S.A) that stressed the dominant role of physical factors like temperature, salinity, and nutrients in regulating plant <b>primary</b> <b>productivity</b> and ecosystem structure (Teal 1962, Odum 1971). Ecologists noted that marsh plants were not heavily grazed {{and appeared to}} be relatively unpalatable, and thus argued that most plants entered salt marsh food chains as detritus (Teal 1962). A corollary of this dogma is that consumers play an unimportant or subtle role in controlling salt marsh primary production (Smalley 1960, Teal 1962). This paradigm was widely accepted for decades and applied to other ecosystems like mangroves and seagrass beds (Bertness 2007), and has thus “become entrenched in the conceptual understanding of coastal ecosystems” (quote from Bertness and Silliman 2008; Smalley 1960, Nixon 1982).|$|E

40|$|Summary We modeled {{the effects}} of climate change and two forest {{management}} scenarios on wood production and forest carbon balance in French forests using process-based models of forest growth. We combined data from the national forest in-ventory and soil network survey, which were aggregated over a 50 × 50 -km grid, i. e., the spatial resolution of the climate sce-nario data. We predicted and analyzed the climate impact on potential forest production over the period 1960 – 2100. All models predicted a slight increase in potential forest yield until 2030 – 2050, followed by a plateau or a decline around 2070 – 2100, with overall, a greater increase in yield in northern France than in the south. Gross and net <b>primary</b> <b>productivities</b> were more negatively affected by soil water and atmospheric water vapor saturation deficits in western France because of a more pro-nounced shift in seasonal rainfall from summer to winter. The rotation-averaged values of carbon flux and production for different forest management options were estimated during four years (1980, 2015, 2045 and 2080). Predictions were made using a two-dimensional matrix covering the range of lo-cal soil and climate conditions. The changes in ecosystem fluxes and forest production were explained by the counterbal-ancing effect of rising CO 2 concentration and increasing water deficit. The effect of climate change decreased with rotation length from short rotations with high production rates and low standing biomasses to long rotations with low productivities and greater standing biomasses. Climate effects on productiv-ity, both negative and positive, were greatest on high fertility sites. Forest productivity in northern France was enhanced by climate change, increasingly from west to east, whereas in the southwestern Atlantic region, productivity was reduced by cli-mate change to an increasing degree from west to east...|$|R
