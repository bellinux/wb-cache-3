Results on the measurement of interfacial area per volume (IAV) in this natural three-dimensional porous medium by the method of image analysis are presented. In Wood 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>metal</b> injection experiments, Wood 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>metal</b> was used to represent a non-wetting fluid and ethylene glycol (EG) was used to represent a wetting phase fluid. To determine the IAV for a Wood 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>metal</b> injected sample, images of the Wood 2 ̆ 7 s-metal-injected core were taken with a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). This is the first attempt to perform IAV measurements within Berea sandstone based on a large quantity of SEM images. ^ Measurements were performed on two-dimensional micro-models to quantify interfacial area per volume for known pore geometry {{as a function of}} fluid pressure and saturation. The transparent micro-models make it possible to visualize and quantify the fluid distributions within the samples and study the detailed capillary pressure-saturation-IAV relationship of each micro-model. The results have shown that as porosity increases, the hysteresis of IAV-saturation relationship decreases. The difference between the drainage and imbibition surfaces from the same sample is small. The theoretical capillary pressure values based on a theoretical equation cannot fit the measured values well and changes need to be made to this equation. ...|$|R

40|$|In 2004, Andy Paparozzi of the National Association of Printing Leadership (NAPL) {{reported}} {{that it was a}} good year for the U.

However, this good news cannot appease the complaints from U. <b>S.</b> <b>printers</b> who are concerned about losing their jobs to overseas printers. According to a survey conducted by the Printing Industries of America/Graphic Arts Technical Foundation (PIA/GATF), 40 % of printers think that their customers are seeking global sourcing for their printing needs. Offshoring is the new reality of globalization. Journalists constantly mention the benefits and dangers in offshoring. No one is really sure if offshoring is beneficial or not, or if it is just overwhelming the printing industry. For the following thesis, the researcher conducted two surveys. One targeted U. S. print buyers (buyers, brokers, and book publishers); the other survey targeted Chinese printers. This research discusses the following issues: • How do Chinese <b>printers</b> view U. <b>S.</b> offshore print buying trends? • How are Chinese printers planning to upgrade and to improve their capabilities to acquire and to handle offshore print jobs? • Is there a trend (an increase or a decrease) in offshore print buying from China? • How do U.

In this case transport properties are similar for the S/DW/S and S/DW/N junctions and are controlled by sequential tunneling of spatially separated Cooper pairs across the domain wall. In the absence of inelastic scattering we find that a Josephson current circulates only if the size of the ferromagnetic region is smaller than the elastic mean free path meaning that the Josephson effect associated to crossed Andreev reflection cannot be observed under usual experimental conditions. Nevertheless a finite dc current can circulate across the S/DW/S junction due to crossed Andreev reflection associated to sequential tunneling.
