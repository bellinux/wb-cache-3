With these remarkably few structural elements it is possible to obtain simple explicit formulas where the only material parameters are given by standard tests in terms of short span compression test and bending resistance. The BCR for different packages is then obtained by a simply summation of the load from the panels and corner panels.

The research was conducted in three stages, namely: the measurement of physical and mechanical properties of fruit (Stage I); the packaging design i. e. determining the <b>packaging</b> <b>dimension</b> (Stage II); and packaging design testing (Stage III). Compression and vibration testing were conducted. For the vibration testing, transport simulations were conducted using the vibration simulator of 3. 50 Hz and amplitude of 4. 61 cm for 3 hours. The packaging was designed with a capacity of 8 kg and 15 kg using two packing pattern, namely the fcc and Jumble. Based on the physical and mechanical properties, optimal packing pattern of 8 kg container was 8, 4, and 4 pieces of fruit for the long x, y, and z direction, respectively, with the density of 62 %. Therefore, gave <b>packaging</b> <b>dimension</b> of 39. 4 x 21 x 21 cm. For the 15 kg container, the optimal packing pattern was 8, 6 and 5 pieces of fruit for the x, y, and z direction, respectively, with the packing density of 65. 6 %.

The computational results of product shelf life showed that the choice of respiration models, including a transition state model and an enzyme kinetic model, had a strong impact on the accuracy of shelf life estimation. A shelf life prediction of broccoli in MAP also revealed that the package dimension had little effect on time to reach steady-state condition, but had a significant effect on the level of O 2 remaining inside the package at equilibrium.

40|$|Work {{is being}} {{performed}} {{to develop a}} versatile micro-power sensor platform {{for the purpose of}} periodic, remote sensing of environmental variables such as subsurface moisture or radiation. The key characteristics of the platform architecture are that the components are passive, thereby requiring no internal power source and that it communicates with a &# 34;reader&# 34; via short range telemetry, i. e. no wires need penetrate barrier structure. Other significant attributes include the potential for a long service life and a compact size that makes it well suited for retrofitting existing barrier structures. Functionally, the sensor package is read by a short range induction coil that both activates/powers the sensor platform and detects the sensor output via a radio frequency signal generated by the onboard programmable interface controller microchip. To date, a prototype of the platform has been constructed and tested with a commercial moisture sensor. Work is now in progress to extend the capabilities of the existing platform to permit moisture sensing through landfill surface barriers (caps).

As a matter of fact, much of our knowledge of thermosonic flip chip bonding comes from wirebonding technology, where it is commonly agreed that {{the flexibility of the}} process windows in wirebonding decreases with the increase in ultrasonic frequency, even though the bond time and the bond temperature are usually lower under higher ultrasonic frequency. Our main objective is to compare the process windows under different ultrasonic frequencies for thermosonic flip chip application. The interaction effects of bond power and bond force on the die shear strength and package standoff height are elucidated. The effects due to different substrate materials (FR- 4 and ceramic substrates) are also included. It is interesting to notice that apparently the vibrating amplitude and thence the bonding frequency {{play a key role in}} determining the robustness of the thermosonic flip chip bondings. Based on our findings the process windows of 63 kHz and 109 kHz bonding on FR- 4 and ceramic substrates are established respectively and compared. Unlike some earlier studies on high frequency bonding in wirebonding, the findings in this work suggests that the process window of the 109 kHz bonding is in fact wider than the 63 kHz bonding on both substrate materials, where rigid ceramic substrates allowed larger process windows for both frequencies bondings than FR- 4 substrates...|$|E

Albeit extremely rare, accidental drop impacts may occur during transportation or mounting ECUs on automobiles, damaging the built-in printed circuit board (PCB) /ball grid array (BGA) package assembly. However, due to larger <b>package</b> <b>dimensions</b> together with heavy components such as capacitors mounted on the board surface, higher acceleration and stress levels can be achieved on ECU electronic components than on hand-held electronic devices during a drop impact. In such cases, the board level drop test methodology defined in the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC) standard needs to be modified in order to match the requirements in automotive applications. The experimental setup {{used in this study}} includes a test board clamped between two aluminum frames with the help of screws, in order to reproduce the real clamping condition s of the PCB in an ECU.

In this work, the mechanical behavior of PCB/BGA assemblies used in automotive applications when subjected to drop events is assessed. Numerical simulations of the board behavior are performed in order to analyze the transient structural response of the PCB and evaluate the local stresses on the board/joint interface responsible for pad cratering.

This results, however, in increased <b>package</b> <b>dimensions</b> which makes its placement and the design of the surgery more critical. This problem is increased by {{the fact that we have}} considered it important to be able to remove the package and replace it with another without disturbing the implanted electrode array, should the first receiver-stimulator fail or an improved design become available. This has meant the design of a special connector (Patrick, 1977; Clark et al., 1978) which adds to the dimensions of the implanted unit. In addition the placement of the coils for transmitting power and information has to be considered. Not only is it desirable to site the coils at a convenient location behind the ear to facilitate the placement and wearing of the external transmitter, but there should also be no relative movement between the coils and the electronic package. These design considerations have led to the sitting of the coils on top of the hermetically-sealed box, and further increased the height of the package.

40|$|Out-of-plane {{displacement}} (warpage) {{is one of}} {{the major}} thermomechanical reliability concerns for board-level electronic packaging. Printed wiring board (PWB) and component warpage results from CTE mismatch among the materials that make up the PWB assembly (PWBA). Warpage occurring during surface-mount assembly reflow processes and normal operations may cause serious reliability problems. In this research, a convective reflow and projection moire warpage measurement system was developed. The system is the first real-time, non-contact, and full-field measurement system capable of measuring PWB/PWBA/chip package warpage with the projection moire technique during different thermal reflow processes. In order to accurately simulate the reflow process and to achieve the ideal heating rate, a convective heating system was designed and integrated with the projection moire system. An advanced feedback controller was implemented to obtain the optimum heating responses. The developed system has the advantages of simulating different types of reflow processes, and reducing the temperature gradients through the PWBA thickness to ensure that the projection moire system can provide more accurate measurements. Automatic package detection and segmentation algorithms were developed for the projection moire system. The algorithms are used for automatic segmentation of the PWB and assembled packages so that the warpage of the PWB and chip packages can be determined individually. The effect of initial PWB warpage on the fatigue reliability of solder bumps on board assemblies was investigated using finite element modeling (FEM) and the projection moire system. The 3 -D models of PWBAs with varying board warpage were used to estimate the solder bump fatigue life for different chip packages mounted on PWBs. The simulation results were validated and correlated with the experimental results obtained using the projection moire system and accelerated thermal cycling tests. Design of experiments and an advanced prediction model were generated to predict solder bump fatigue life based on the initial PWB warpage, <b>package</b> <b>dimensions</b> and locations, and solder bump materials.
