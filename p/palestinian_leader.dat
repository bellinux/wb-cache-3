5|$|Persistent {{attempts}} by the Israeli government to identify another <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leader</b> to represent the Palestinian people failed. Arafat was enjoying the support of groups that, given his own history, would normally have been quite wary of dealing with or supporting him. Marwan Barghouti (a leader of al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades) emerged as a possible replacement during the Second Intifada, but Israel had him arrested for allegedly {{being involved in the}} killing of twenty-six civilians, and he was sentenced to five life terms.|$|E
5|$|Like Nasser, Gaddafi favoured the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leader</b> Yasser Arafat and his group, Fatah, {{over more}} militant and Marxist Palestinian groups. As the years progressed however, Gaddafi's {{relationship}} with Arafat became strained, with Gaddafi considering him too moderate {{and calling for}} more violent action. Instead he supported militias like the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, As-Sa'iqa, the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, and the Abu Nidal Organization. He funded the Black September Organization whose members perpetrated the 1972 Munich massacre of Israeli athletes in West Germany, and had the killed militants' bodies flown to Libya for a hero's funeral.|$|E

25|$|During the Second World War, the Jewish Agency {{worked to}} {{establish}} a Jewish army that would fight alongside the British forces. Churchill supported the plan but British Military and government opposition led to its rejection.

25|$|Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni {{was killed}} during the night of 7–8 April, {{in the middle of}} the battles taking place in Al-Qastal. The loss of the charismatic <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leader</b> 'disrupted the Arab {{strategy}} and organisation in the area of Jerusalem.' His successor, Emil Ghuri, changed tactics: instead of provoking a series of ambushes throughout the route, he had a huge road block erected at Bab-el-Oued, and Jerusalem was once again isolated as a consequence.|$|E
25|$|The Intifada is {{sometimes}} called the Oslo War (מלחמת אוסלו) by some Israelis who consider {{it to be the}} result of concessions made by Israel following the Oslo Accords, and Arafat's War, after the late <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leader</b> whom some blamed for starting it. Others have named what they consider disproportionate response to what was initially a popular uprising by unarmed demonstrators as the reason for the escalation of the Intifada into an all out war.|$|E
25|$|After {{the suicide}} bombing, Palestinian {{university}} {{students at the}} An-Najah University in the West Bank city of Nablus created an exhibition celebrating {{the first anniversary of}} the Second Intifada. The exhibit’s main attraction was a room-sized re-enactment of the bombing at Sbarro. The installation featured broken furniture splattered with fake blood and human body parts. The entrance to the exhibition was illustrated with a mural depicting the bombing. The exhibit was later shut down by <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leader</b> Yasser Arafat.|$|E

500|$|Abnormally high {{concentrations}} of 210Po were detected in July 2012 in clothes and personal belongings of the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leader</b> Yasser Arafat, a heavy smoker, who died on 11 November 2004 of uncertain causes. The spokesman for the Institut de Radiophysique in Lausanne, Switzerland, where those items were analyzed, stressed that the [...] "clinical symptoms described in Arafat's medical reports were not consistent with polonium-210 and that conclusions could not be drawn {{as to whether the}} <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leader</b> was poisoned or not", and that [...] "the only way to confirm the findings would be to exhume Arafat's body to test it for polonium-210." [...] On 27 November 2012 Arafat's body was exhumed, and samples were taken for separate analysis by experts from France, Switzerland and Russia. On 12 October 2013, The Lancet published the group's finding that high levels of the element were found in Arafat's blood, urine, and in saliva stains on his clothes and toothbrush. The French tests later found some polonium but stated it was from [...] "natural environmental origin". Following later Russian tests, Vladimir Uiba, the head of the Russian Federal Medical and Biological Agency, stated in December 2013 that Arafat died of natural causes, and they had no plans to conduct further tests.|$|E

500|$|Al-Wazir and the Fatah {{leadership}} {{settled in}} Damascus, Syria in 1965, in order {{take advantage of}} the large number of Palestine Liberation Army (PLA) members there. On May 9, 1966, he and Arafat were detained by Syrian police loyal to air marshal Hafez al-Assad after an incident where a pro-Syrian <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leader,</b> Yusuf Orabi was thrown out of the window of a three-story building and killed. Al-Wazir and Arafat were either considering uniting Fatah with Orabi's faction—the Revolutionary Front for the Liberation of Palestine—or winning Orabi's support against Arafat's rivals within the Fatah leadership. An argument occurred, eventually leading to Orabi's murder; however, al-Wazir and Arafat had already left the scene shortly before the incident. According to Aburish, Orabi and Assad were [...] "close friends" [...] and Assad appointed a panel to investigate what happened. The panel found both Arafat and al-Wazir guilty, but Salah Jadid, then Deputy Secretary-General of the President of Syria, pardoned them.|$|E

[...] Some Israeli supporters said that Clinton never should have kissed the wife of the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leader,</b> especially after such inflammatory remarks. The following day, Clinton denounced Suha Arafat's allegations, and said that Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat had told her Suha Arafat had been referring to 'tear gas' and not 'poison gas'. The kiss became a campaign issue, especially with Jewish voters. [...] Clinton said it as a formality akin to a handshake, saying that to not have done so would have caused a diplomatic incident. [...] Clinton later wrote that the live Arabic-to-English translation had failed to convey the accurate nature of her remarks: [...] "Had I been aware of her hateful words, I would have denounced them on the spot." ...|$|E
