5000|$|Saunders' {{success with}} the {{relatively}} unpolished [...] "On & On" [...] inspired other Chicago DJs to try their hand at producing and releasing original songs in a similar style, using electronic instrumentation. Early such recordings included Jamie Principle and Frankie Knuckles' [...] "Your Love"; and Chip E.'s [...] "The Jack Trax" [...] record, featuring the songs “It’s House” and “Time to Jack”, each of which used complex rhythms, simple bassline, sampling technology, and sparse vocals. [...] These producers were aided in their efforts by the availability of affordable, mass-produced electronic music instruments, including synthesizers, compact sequencers, drum machines (like the Roland TR-909, TR-808 and TR-707, and Latin <b>percussion</b> <b>machine</b> the TR-727) and bass modules (such as the Roland TB-303).|$|E
