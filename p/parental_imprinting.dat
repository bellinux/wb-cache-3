40|$|AbstractInduction of mouse {{germ cells}} occurs from the {{proximal}} epiblast at around embryonic day (E) 7. 0. These germ cells then migrate to, {{and enter the}} gonads at about E 10. 5 after which they undergo epigenetic reprogramming including erasure of <b>parental</b> <b>imprints.</b> However, the epigenetic properties acquired by nascent germ cells and the potential remodeling of these epigenetic marks in the subsequent migratory period have been largely unexplored. Here we have used immunohistochemistry to examine several genome-wide epigenetic modifications occurring in germ cells from their specification to their colonization of the genital ridges. We show that at around E 8. 0, germ cells concomitantly and significantly reduce H 3 -K 9 dimethylation and DNA methylation, two major repressive modifications for gene expression. These events are preceded by the transient loss of all the DNA methyltransferases from their nuclei. By contrast, germ cells substantially increase the levels of H 3 -K 27 trimethylation, another repressive modification with more plasticity, at E 8. 5 – 9. 0 and maintain this state until at least E 12. 5. H 3 -K 4 methylation and H 3 -K 9 acetylation, modifications associated with transcriptionally permissive/active chromatin, are similar in germ and surrounding somatic cells but germ cells transiently increase these marks sharply upon their entry into the genital ridge. H 3 -K 9 trimethylation, a hallmark of centromeric heterochromatin, is kept relatively constant during the periods examined. We suggest that this orderly and extensive epigenetic reprogramming in premigratory and migratory germ cells might be necessary for their reacquisition of underlying totipotency, for subsequent specific epigenetic remodeling, including the resetting of <b>parental</b> <b>imprints,</b> and {{for the production of}} gametes with an appropriate epigenotype for supporting normal development...|$|R

First, the protamines associated with male DNA are replaced with histones from the female's cytoplasm, most of which are acetylated due to either higher abundance of acetylated histones in the female's cytoplasm or through preferential binding of the male DNA to acetylated histones. Second, male DNA is systematically demethylated in many organisms, possibly through 5-hydroxymethylcytosine.

Both in specialized and in ordinary language, guilt is an affective state in which one experiences conflict at having done something that one believes one should not have done (or conversely, having not done something one believes one should have done). It gives rise to a feeling which does not go away easily, driven by 'conscience'. Sigmund Freud described this as the result of a struggle between the ego and the superego - <b>parental</b> <b>imprinting.</b> Freud rejected the role of God as punisher in times of illness or rewarder in time of wellness. While removing one source of guilt from patients, he described another.

40|$|Some {{genes in}} mammals and {{flowering}} plants {{are subject to}} <b>parental</b> <b>imprinting,</b> a process by which differential epigenetic marks are imposed on male and female gametes so that one set of alleles is silenced on chromosomes contributed by the mother while another is silenced on paternal chromosomes. Therefore, each genome contributes {{a different set of}} active alleles to the offspring, which develop abnormally if the parental genome balance is disturbed. In Arabidopsis, seeds inheriting extra maternal genomes show distinctive phenotypes such as law weight and inhibition of mitosis in the endosperm, while extra paternal genomes result in reciprocal phenotypes such as high weight and endosperm overproliferation, DNA methylation is known to be an essential component of the <b>parental</b> <b>imprinting</b> mechanism in mammals, but there is less evidence for this in plants. For the present study, seed development was examined in crosses using a transgenic Arabidopsis line with reduced DNA methylation. Crosses between hypomethylated and wild-type diploid plants produced similar seed phenotypes to crosses between plants with normal methylation but different ploidies, This is consistent with a model in which hypomethylation of one parental genome prevents silencing of alleles that would normally be active only when inherited from the other parent - thus phenocopying the effects of extra genomes, These results suggest an important role for methylation in parent-of-origin effects, and by inference <b>parental</b> <b>imprinting,</b> in plants. The phenotype of biparentally hypomethylated seeds is less extreme than the reciprocal phenotypes of uniparentally hypomethylated seeds, The observation that development is less severely affected if gametes of both sexes (rather than just one) are 'neutralized' with respect to parent-of-origin effects supports the hypothesis that <b>parental</b> <b>imprinting</b> is not necessary to regulate development...|$|E
40|$|Genomic {{imprinting}} in mammals {{marks the}} two parental alleles resulting in differential gene expression. Imprinted loci {{are characterized by}} distinct epigenetic modifications such as differential DNA methylation and asynchronous replication timing. To determine the role of DNA methylation in replication timing of imprinted loci, we analyzed replication timing in Dnmt 1 - and Dnmt 3 L-deficient embryonic stem (ES) cells, which lack differential DNA methylation and imprinted gene expression. Asynchronous replication is maintained in these ES cells, indicating that asynchronous replication is parent-specific without the requirement for differential DNA methylation. Imprinting centers are required for regional control of imprinted gene expression. Analysis of replication fork movement and three-dimensional RNA and DNA fluoroscent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of the Igf 2 -H 19 locus in various cell types indicate that the Igf 2 -H 19 imprinting center differentially regulates replication timing of nearby replicons and subnuclear localization.

Deletions in the transcription unit of the imprinted SNRPN gene have been found in patients who have PWS or Angelman syndrome because of a <b>parental</b> <b>imprint</b> switch failure in this chromosomal domain. It has been suggested that the SNRPN exon 1 region, which is deleted in the PWS patients, contains an imprint switch element from which the maternal and paternal epigenotypes of the 15 q 11 -q 13 domain originate. Using the model organism Drosophila, we show here that a fragment from this region can function as a silencer in transgenic flies. Repression was detected specifically from this element and could not be observed with control human sequences. Additional experiments allowed the delineation of the silencer to a fragment of 215 bp containing the SNRPN promoter region.

In addition, an excess of maternal DR 3 and paternal DR 4 alleles among patients (DR 3 DR 4) is observed.

Using the marker-association-segregation-chi 2 method, we have tested four hypotheses with different parental effects of two susceptibility alleles, alpha 0 and beta 0, at two different closely linked loci.

40|$|In {{mammals and}} plants, <b>parental</b> genomic <b>imprinting</b> restricts the {{expression}} of specific loci to one <b>parental</b> allele. <b>Imprinting</b> in mammals relies on sex-dependent de novo deposition of DNA methylation during gametogenesis but a comparable mechanism was not shown in plants. Rather, paternal silencing by the maintenance DNA methyltransferase 1 (MET 1) and maternal activation by the DNA demethylase DEMETER (DME) cause maternal expression. However, genome-wide studies suggested other DNA methylation-dependent imprinting mechanisms. Here, we show that de novo RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) regulates imprinting at specific loci expressed in endosperm. RdDM in somatic tissues is required to silence expression of the paternal allele. By contrast, the repression of RdDM in female gametes participates with or without DME requirement in the activation of the maternal allele. The contrasted activity of DNA methylation {{between male and female}} gametes appears sufficient to prime imprinted maternal expression. After fertilization, MET 1 maintains differential expression between the parental alleles. RdDM depends on small interfering RNAs (siRNAs).

40|$|A unique {{feature of}} the germ cell lineage is the {{generation}} of totipotency. A critical event {{in this context is}} DNA demethylation and the erasure of <b>parental</b> <b>imprints</b> in mouse primordial germ cells (PGCs) on embryonic day 11. 5 (E 11. 5) after they enter into the developing gonads 1, 2. Little is yet known about the mechanism involved, except that it is apparently an active process. We have examined the associated changes in the chromatin to gain further insights into this reprogramming event. Here we show that the chromatin changes occur in two steps. The first changes in nascent PGCs at E 8. 5 establish a distinctive chromatin signature that is reminiscent of pluripotency. Next, when PGCs are residing in the gonads, major changes occur in nuclear architecture accompanied by an extensive erasure of several histone modifications and exchange of histone variants. Furthermore, the histone chaperones HIRA and NAP- 1 (NAP 111), which are implicated in histone exchange, accumulate in PGC nuclei undergoing reprogramming. We therefore suggest that the mechanism of histone replacement is critical for these chromatin rearrangements to occur. The marked chromatin changes are intimately linked with genome-wide DNA demethylation. On the basis of the timing of the observed events, we propose that if DNA demethylation entails a DNA repair-based mechanism, the evident histone replacement would represent a repair-induced response event rather than being a prerequisite...|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{disorders}} involving imprinted genes such as Angelman syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) {{can have}} a mutation in the imprinting mechanism. Previously, we identified an imprinting center (IC) within chromosome 15 q 11 -ql 3 and proposed that IC mutations block resetting of the imprint, fixing on that chromosome the <b>parental</b> <b>imprint</b> (epigenotype) on which the mutation arose. We now describe four new microdeletions of the IC, the smallest (6 kb) of which currently defines the minimal region sufficient to confer an AS imprinting mutation. The AS deletions all overlap this minimal region, centromeric to the PWS microdeletions, which include the first exon of the SNRPN gene. None of five genes or transcripts in the 1. 0 Mb vicinity of the IC (ZNF 127, SNRPN, PAR- 5, IPW, and PAR- 1), each normally expressed only from the paternal allele, was expressed in cells from PWS imprinting mutation patients. In contrast, AS imprinting mutation patients show biparental expression of SNRPN and IPW but must lack expression of the putative AS gene 250 - 1000 kb distal of the IC. These data strongly support a model in which the paternal chromosome of these PWS patients carries an ancestral maternal epigenotype, and the maternal chromosome of these AS patients carries an ancestral paternal epigenotype. The IC therefore functions to reset the maternal and paternal imprints throughout a 2 -Mb imprinted domain within human chromosome 15 q 11 -q 13 during gametogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Genome-wide {{epigenetic}} reprogramming in mammalian germ cells, zygote {{and early}} embryos, plays {{a crucial role}} in regulating genome functions at critical stages of development. We show here that mouse primordial germ cells (PGCs) exhibit dynamic changes in epigenetic modifications between days 10. 5 and 12. 5 post coitum (dpc). First, contrary to previous suggestions, we show that PGCs do indeed acquire genome-wide de novo methylation during early development and migration into the genital ridge. However, following their entry into the genital ridge, there is rapid erasure of DNA methylation of regions within imprinted and non-imprinted loci. For most genes, the erasure commences simultaneously in PGCs in both male and female embryos, which is completed within 1 day of development. Based on the kinetics of this process, we suggest that this is an active demethylation process initiated upon the entry of PGCs into the gonadal anlagen. The timing of reprogramming in PGCs is crucial since it ensures that germ cells of both sexes acquire an equivalent epigenetic state prior to the differentiation of the definitive male and female germ cells in which new <b>parental</b> <b>imprints</b> are established subsequently. Some repetitive elements, however, show incomplete erasure, which may be essential for chromosome stability and for preventing activation of transposons {{to reduce the risk of}} germline mutations.

We previously described a form of imprinted X inactivation in Caenorhabditis elegans where dimethylation on histone 3 at lysine 4 (H 3 K 4 me 2), a mark of active chromatin, is excluded from the paternal X chromosome (Xp) during spermatogenesis and persists through early cell divisions in the embryo. Based on the observation that the Xp (unlike the maternal X or any autosome) is largely transcriptionally inactive in the paternal germ line, we hypothesized that transcriptional activity in the parent germ line may influence epigenetic information inherited by and maintained in the embryo. We report that chromatin modifications and histone variant patterns assembled in the germ line can be retained in mature gametes. Furthermore, despite extensive chromatin remodeling events at fertilization, the modification patterns arriving with the gametes are largely retained in the early embryo. Using transgenes, we observe that expression in the parental germline correlates with differential chromatin assembly that is replicated and maintained in the early embryo.

The IC controls resetting of <b>parental</b> <b>imprints</b> in 15 q 11 -q 13 during gametogenesis. We have identified a larger series of cases of familial PWS, including one case with a deletion of only 7. 5 kb, that narrows the PWS critical region to < 4. 3 kb spanning the SNRPN gene CpG island and exon 1. Identification of a strong DNase I hypersensitive site, specific for the paternal allele, and six evolutionarily conserved (human-mouse) sequences that are potential transcription-factor binding sites is consistent with this region defining the SNRPN gene promoter.
