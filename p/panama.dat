In 1980, however, he declined an offer to become provost, and instead {{returned to}} Panamanian politics.|$|E

5|$|Noriega {{acted as}} a conduit for U.S. support to the Contra militants in Nicaragua for many years, {{including}} funds and weapons. He allowed the CIA to establish listening posts in <b>Panama,</b> and also helped the U.S.-backed Salvadoran government against the leftist Salvadoran insurgent Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front. U.S. spy ships used bases in <b>Panama</b> in their operations against the Nicaraguan government, {{and much of the}} intelligence gathered by these ships was processed in the U.S. bases in <b>Panama.</b> Noriega permitted these activities despite the <b>Panama</b> Canal treaties restricting the use of the U.S. bases to protecting the canal.|$|E
5|$|<b>Panama</b> asked France to {{extradite}} Noriega {{so he could}} face trial for human rights violations in <b>Panama.</b> The French government had previously stated that extradition would not happen before the case in France had run its course. On September 23, 2011, a French court ordered a conditional release for Noriega to be extradited to <b>Panama</b> on October 1, 2011. Noriega was extradited to <b>Panama</b> on December 11, 2011, and incarcerated at El Renacer prison to serve time for crimes committed during his rule.|$|E
5|$|After the United States {{occupation}} of Veracruz on 21 April 1914 (which found six American-Hawaiian ships in Mexican ports), the Huerta-led Mexican government closed the Tehuantepec National Railway to American shipping. This loss of access, {{coupled with the}} fact that the <b>Panama</b> Canal was not yet open, caused American-Hawaiian to return to its historic route of sailing around South America via the Straits of Magellan in late April. With the opening of the <b>Panama</b> Canal on 15 August, American-Hawaiian ships switched to taking that route. In October 1915, landslides closed the <b>Panama</b> Canal and all American-Hawaiian ships, including American, returned to the Straits of Magellan route again.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1969 Torrijos went to Mexico on holiday. A coup was {{launched}} in his absence, in which Noriega's loyalty allowed Torrijos {{to hang on to}} power, greatly enhancing Torrijos's image. Torrijos promoted Noriega to the position of lieutenant colonel and appointed him chief of military intelligence in August 1970: Noriega had gone from being a captain to a lieutenant colonel in just a year and a half, and according to Dinges, had left his undisciplined past behind him. Torrijos retained power as a military ruler until 1981: during this time he negotiated the Torrijos–Carter Treaties with U.S. President Jimmy Carter, which ensured that control over the <b>Panama</b> Canal would pass to <b>Panama</b> in 1999. These treaties, as well as a new labor code that included maternity leave, collective bargaining rights, and bonus pay, made Torrijos popular in <b>Panama</b> despite the absence of democratic elections. Galván writes that Torrijos's relationship with Noriega was symbiotic; Torrijos provided the political acumen, while Noriega enforced his unpopular decisions with force, when necessary. Noriega would provide intelligence, and carry out covert operations, that were critical to Torrijos successfully negotiating the release of the <b>Panama</b> Canal from the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Between 1847 and 1870, the {{population}} of San Francisco increased from 500 to 150,000. The Gold Rush wealth and population increase led to significantly improved transportation between California and the East Coast. The <b>Panama</b> Railway, spanning the Isthmus of <b>Panama,</b> was finished in 1855. Steamships, including those owned by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, began regular service from San Francisco to <b>Panama,</b> where passengers, goods and mail would take the train across the Isthmus and board steamships headed to the East Coast. One ill-fated journey, that of the S.S. Central America, ended in disaster as the ship sank in a hurricane {{off the coast of}} the Carolinas in 1857, with approximately three tons of California gold aboard.|$|E
5|$|Butler and {{his family}} were living in <b>Panama</b> in January 1914 when he was ordered to report as the Marine officer of a {{battleship}} squadron massing off the coast of Mexico, near Veracruz, to monitor a revolutionary movement.

50|$|The {{high levels}} of Panamanian trade are in large part from the Colón Free Trade Zone, the largest free trade zone in the Western Hemisphere. Last year the zone {{accounted}} for 92% of <b>Panama's</b> exports and 64% of its imports, {{according to an analysis}} of figures from the Colon zone management and estimates of <b>Panama's</b> trade by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. <b>Panama's</b> economy is also very much supported by the trade and export of coffee and other agricultural products.|$|R

50|$|Despite <b>Panama's</b> upper-middle {{per capita}} GDP, {{it remains a}} country of stark contrasts.

5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, American law {{enforcement}} officials had reports of Noriega's possible involvement with narcotics trafficking. No formal criminal investigations were begun, however, with news reports attributing the lack of action to factors including U.S. interest in concluding the <b>Panama</b> Canal treaty, the value of intelligence from <b>Panama,</b> and Panama's support for U.S. foreign policy.|$|E

5|$|During her {{tenure in}} office, she {{presided over the}} {{handover}} of the <b>Panama</b> Canal from the US to <b>Panama</b> and the economic downturn that resulted {{from the loss of}} US personnel. Hobbled by new spending restrictions passed by the opposition-controlled Legislative Assembly, and her administration's corruption scandals, she had difficulty passing her legislative initiatives. Her popularity declined, and her party's candidate José Miguel Alemán lost to the PRD's Torrijos in the subsequent general elections to succeed her.|$|E
