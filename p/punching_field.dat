5000|$|In 1998, Coleman {{was charged}} with assault while he {{was working as a}} {{security}} guard. Tracy Fields, a Los Angeles bus driver and fan of Coleman's work on Diff'rent Strokes, approached him in a California mall and requested his autograph, while Coleman was shopping for a bulletproof vest. Coleman refused to give her an autograph, an argument ensued, and Fields reportedly mocked Coleman's lackluster career as an actor. Coleman then <b>punched</b> <b>Fields</b> in the face several times in front of witnesses. He was arrested and later testified in court that she threatened him, and he defended himself. [...] "She wouldn't leave me alone. I was getting scared, and she was getting ugly," [...] he said. Coleman pleaded no contest to one count of assault, received a suspended jail sentence, and was ordered to pay Fields' $1,665 hospital bill, as well as take anger management classes.|$|R

5000|$|Thoughts of Yesterday: 1981-1982 is a {{compilation}} album of early material by the American hardcore punk band T.S.O.L. (True Sounds of Liberty), released in 1987 by Posh Boy Records. It combines the band's two EPs, 1981's T.S.O.L. and 1982's Weathered Statues, {{as well as}} an early version of [...] "Peace Thru' Power", a song that was re-recorded for their first full-length album Dance with Me (1981). The album's release stemmed from a dispute between T.S.O.L. and Posh Boy owner Robbie Fields that began when the band left Posh Boy after releasing T.S.O.L., moving to Frontier Records for Dance with Me. Fields maintained that the band owed his label another EP, and withheld royalties from them as a result. The dispute culminated in singer Jack Grisham <b>punching</b> <b>Fields</b> in the face. Several years later, after Grisham and drummer Todd Barnes had both left T.S.O.L., a settlement was negotiated in which the band members received back royalty payments and Posh Boy acquired the rights to Weathered Statues, originally released through Alternative Tentacles. Posh Boy combined the two EPs to create Thoughts of Yesterday.|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} T.S.O.L. {{lineup of}} singer Jack Grisham, guitarist Ron Emory, bassist Mike Roche, and drummer Todd Barnes released their debut EP, T.S.O.L., in 1981 through Posh Boy Records. According to Grisham, the band had already written {{most of the}} songs that would end up on their first full-length album, but were distrustful of Posh Boy owner Robbie Fields and chose to put out an EP through the label instead: [...] "We knew Posh Boy was gonna burn us, {{but we wanted to}} put out a record. So it was like 'Let's give him these songs, and we'll save the good stuff for later. Shortly after the EP's release the band moved to Frontier Records for their first studio album, 1981's Dance with Me. This caused a dispute with Fields, who claimed the band had not honored their contractual commitment to record a second EP for his label. [...] "That chameleon Grisham had me drink the sweetest wine of fraternal love," [...] said Fields, [...] "and with my next breath I tasted the bitter bile of betrayal as he unleashed the running dogs of hatred upon me." [...] The dispute culminated in Grisham <b>punching</b> <b>Fields</b> in the nose in 1982 outside a roller rink in Fullerton, California.|$|R

50|$|MPS is column-oriented (as {{opposed to}} {{entering}} the model as equations), and all model components (variables, rows, etc.) receive names. MPS {{is an old}} format, so it is set up for <b>punch</b> cards: <b>Fields</b> start in column 2, 5, 15, 25, 40 and 50. Sections of an MPS file are marked by so-called header cards, which are distinguished by their starting in column 1. Although it is typical to use upper-case throughout the file for historical reasons, many MPS-readers will accept mixed-case for anything except the header cards, and some allow mixed-case anywhere. The names that you choose for the individual entities (constraints or variables) are not important to the solver; one should pick meaningful names, or easy names for a post-processing code to read.|$|R

50|$|Pittsburgh {{was not at}} all {{accustomed}} to playing Nebraska from the perspective of avenging a loss, but after having their 12-game streak over the Cornhuskers broken the previous year, sights were set on putting Nebraska back in their place as they were brought to Pitt Stadium. The Cornhuskers scored first in a bid to prove that 1939 was no fluke, but the Panthers answered right back soon after. As Nebraska had failed to convert, Pittsburgh now held a 7-6 lead and fought to a standoff until halftime. Before {{the end of the third}} quarter, though, the Cornhuskers managed to <b>punch</b> in a <b>field</b> goal to go ahead, and successfully held off the Panthers for the rest of the game. It was the first time Nebraska had defeated Pittsburgh twice in a row in all 15 tries, and the victory moved the Cornhuskers up to #8 in the AP Poll, though they still lagged in the series at 3-9-3.|$|R
50|$|This {{hotel was}} built in 1840 and was then called the Victoria Hotel. It was then renamed the Royal Hotel and at this time was the last and most {{southern}} hotel on the seafront. In 1847 the English writer and social critic Charles Dickens stayed in the hotel, along with his friend and colleague Mark lemon who was the founding editor of both <b>Punch</b> and The <b>Field.</b> at the time Dickens was occupied writing his Novel David Copperfield which was first published as a serial. During his stay at the hotel, Dickens had described Great Yarmouth to his wife in a letter thus Yarmouth was the most wondrous sight his eyes had ever beheld.

50|$|Granger got her {{start in}} the {{entertainment}} industry when she won a beauty contest at the age of 13 at Silver Beach Summer Resort near Houston. Her budding figure and confident stage presence were perfect for studios that made comedy shorts. In 1930 her father took her to producer Hal Roach, who was then testing talent for his upcoming comedy series, The Boy Friends. Granger’s natural comedy timing got her the job immediately and she was placed under contract to Hal Roach Studios. She became a charter member of the two-reel-comedy community, appearing opposite many major comedians at Roach, Mack Sennett, Educational Pictures, Columbia Pictures, and RKO Radio Pictures. Among her famous credits are Hog Wild with Laurel & Hardy, The Dentist with W.C. <b>Fields,</b> <b>Punch</b> Drunks and Termites of 1938 with The Three Stooges. Granger also appeared with Andy Clyde, Charley Chase, Edgar Kennedy, Harry Langdon, Gus Schilling & Richard Lane, and Joe DeRita, as well as on live television with Abbott & Costello. Granger is best remembered as the sarcastic, suspicious wife in Leon Errol’s series of two-reelers for RKO.|$|R
