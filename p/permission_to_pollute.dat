30|$|Figure  7 b shows {{a decline}} in the area of {{interior}} forests from 64.42  % (1979) to 53.33  % (1989), with increase in edge forests (12  %). The major activities during this period were industrialization, infrastructure development, intensified agriculture, manganese mining, a ferromanganese plant, a paper mill and plantations. The provision of forest resources to industries at highly subsidized rates and <b>permission</b> <b>to</b> <b>polluting</b> industries in the ecologically sensitive regions have contributed to the decline of forests and contamination of natural resources. Unplanned developmental activities such as a series of large scale power projects, manganese mining, a ferromanganese plant, a paper mill and several irrigation projects have led to the retreat of forests, with their degradation evident in the form of barren hilltops. The mismanagement of Kans (‘sacred forests’ protected by local communities) and reserve forests also aggravated the situation towards the loss of interior, contiguous forests (Chandran 1989). Figure  7 c shows the fragmentation status for the year 1999; the region lost a major portion of its interior forest and reached 40.74  % from 53.33  % (1989) with the increase in edge forests to 16.35  %. Drivers of these changes are the implementation of a series of hydroelectric projects, the construction of national routes NH- 17, NH- 63, NH- 204, the Konkan railway line and other infrastructure projects. Figure  7 d illustrates the status of forests (in 2013) with 25.62  % interior forests and 17.48  % of edge forests, as well as the loss of connectivity between interior forest patches. These interior forests exist now only in the form of protected areas - sanctuaries, protected areas, sacred groves or Kans. The area under non-forests has increased from 36.07 (1999) to 47.3  % (2013) with an increase of edge and perforated patches.|$|R
40|$|Polluted rivers are {{harmful to}} human, {{animals and plants}} living along it. To reduce the harm, {{cleaning}} costs are generated. However, when the river passes through several different countries or regions, a relevant question is how should the costs be shared among the agents. Ni and Wang (2007) first consider this problem as cost sharing problems on a river network, shortly called polluted river problems. They consider rivers with one spring which was generalized by Dong, Ni, and Wang (2012) to rivers with multiple springs. They introduce and axiomatize three cost sharing methods: the Local Responsibility Sharing (LRS) method, the Upstream Equal Sharing (UES) method and the Downstream Equal Sharing (DES) method. In this paper, we show that the UES and DES methods can also be obtained as the conjunctive permission value of an associated game with a permission structure, where the <b>permission</b> structure corresponds <b>to</b> the river structure and the game {{is determined by the}} cleaning costs. Then, we show that several axiomatizations of the conjunctive permission value also give axiomatizations of the UES and DES methods, of which one is comparable with the one from Dong, Ni, and Wang (2012). Besides, by applying another solution, the disjunctive <b>permission</b> value, <b>to</b> <b>polluted</b> river games with a permission structure we obtain a new cost allocation method for polluted river problems. We axiomatize this solution and compare it with the UES method...|$|R
