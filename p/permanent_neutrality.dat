40|$|Abstract In April 1978, {{after nine}} months of {{national}} debate, the Senate narrowly ratified new Panama Canal treaties. Voting was apparently influenced by numerous opinion polls, which were seen as snowing increased support for the treaties. But sev-eral analysts have shown that this interpretation was erroneous; public opinion consistently opposed the treaties. This study at-tempts to determine what went wrong. It begins by arraying and analyzing all national poll results on the topic {{in order to establish}} a coherent picture of public opinion. It then identifies a number of polling and reporting practices which {{may have contributed to the}} misinterpretation of the findings. The study concludes with rec-ommendations for alleviating these problems. On 6 September 1977, Presidents Jimmy Carter of the United States and Omar Torrijos of Panama met in Washington to sign two new treaties governing the status of the Panama Canal. The first, known as the Panama Canal Treaty, acknowledged Panama's sovereignty over the Canal Zone and provided for the United States to gradually shift complete control of the Canal to Panama by the year 2000. The second, known as the Neutrality Treaty, provided for a <b>permanent</b> regime of <b>neutrality</b> after the year 2000. TED J.

50|$|The 1977 Panama Canal Treaties {{entered into}} force on October 1, 1979.

The treaties comprise a basic treaty governing the operation and defense of the Canal from October 1, 1979 to December 31, 1999 (Panama Canal Treaty) and a treaty guaranteeing the <b>permanent</b> <b>neutrality</b> of the Canal (Neutrality Treaty).|$|E

5000|$|The United States {{also has}} a history of {{bilateral}} agreements with Panama, beginning with the Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty (1903) which established the United States' right to build a canal and own it and adjacent property across the otherwise-sovereign nation of Panama. This was replaced by The Treaty Concerning the <b>Permanent</b> <b>Neutrality</b> and Operation of the Panama Canal and the Panama Canal Treaty (both signed 1977).

Also, the EDU is in support for <b>permanent</b> <b>neutrality</b> and is against peace-keeping missions of the Swiss military.

Under this treaty, the U.S. retained the permanent right to defend the canal from any threat that might interfere with its continued neutral service to ships of all nations. The second treaty is titled The Panama Canal Treaty (Tratado del Canal de Panamá), and provided that as from 12:00 on December 31, 1999, Panama would assume full control of canal operations and become primarily responsible for its defense.|$|E
5000|$|This view of {{the events}} of 1938 has deep roots in the 10 years of Allied {{occupation}} and the struggle to regain Austrian sovereignty: the [...] "victim theory" [...] played an essential role in the negotiations for the Austrian State Treaty with the Soviets, and by pointing to the Moscow Declaration, Austrian politicians heavily relied on it to achieve a solution for Austria different from the division of Germany into separate Eastern and Western states. The state treaty, alongside the subsequent Austrian declaration of <b>permanent</b> <b>neutrality,</b> marked important milestones for the solidification of Austria's independent national identity {{during the course of the}} following decades.|$|E

50|$|Though {{controversial}} {{within the}} United States, {{a process of}} handing the Panama canal lead to Panamanian control of the Panama Canal Zone by the Panama Canal Authority (ACP). It was effective at noon on December 31, 1999. Before this handover, the government of Panama held an international bid to negotiate a 25-year contract for operation of the Canal's container shipping ports (chiefly two facilities at the Atlantic and Pacific outlets), which was won by the Chinese firm Hutchison Whampoa, a Hong Kong-based shipping concern whose owner Li Ka Shing is the wealthiest man in Asia. One of the conditions on the handover to the Panama Canal Authority by the United States was the <b>permanent</b> <b>neutrality</b> of the Canal and the explicit statements that allowed the United States to come back at any time.|$|E
5000|$|The second treaty, the Treaty Concerning the <b>Permanent</b> <b>Neutrality</b> and Operation of the Panama Canal, {{or simply}} the Neutrality Treaty, {{was a much}} shorter document. Because it had no fixed {{termination}} date, this treaty was {{the major source of}} controversy. Under its provisions, the United States and Panama agreed to guarantee the canal's neutrality [...] "in order that both in time of peace and in time of war it shall remain secure and open to peaceful transit by the vessels of all nations on terms of entire equality". In times of war, however, United States and Panamanian warships were entitled to [...] "expeditious" [...] transit of the canal under the provisions of Article VI. A Protocol was attached to the Neutrality Treaty, and all nations of the world were invited to subscribe to its provisions.|$|E

But {{at the onset of}} the Second World War, the government, becoming justifiably nervous, decided to expand the capabilities of the National Police (Ríkislögreglan) and its reserves into a military unit. Chief Commissioner of Police Agnar Kofoed Hansen had been trained in the Danish Air Force and he moved swiftly to train his officers. Weapons and uniforms were acquired and near Laugarvatn they practiced rifle shooting and military tactics. Agnar barely managed to train his 60 officers before the United Kingdom invaded Iceland on May 10, 1940. The next step in the drive towards militarisation was to have been the training of the 300 strong reserve forces, but the invasion effectively stopped it.|$|E
