50|$|Unlike dogs, <b>panting</b> {{is a rare}} {{occurrence}} in cats, except in warm weather environments. Some cats may <b>pant</b> in response to anxiety, fear or excitement.

If <b>panting</b> continues, the owner should consult a veterinarian. In many cases, feline <b>panting,</b> especially if accompanied by other symptoms, such as coughing or shallow breathing (dyspnea), is considered to be abnormal, and treated as a medical emergency.|$|R

40|$|Fossils {{from two}} fissure {{fillings}} in <b>Pant</b> Quarry (designated <b>Pant</b> 4 and <b>Pant</b> 5), South Wales, United Kingdom, probably of Early Jurassic age document a taxonomically diverse vertebrate fauna, the Morganucodon -sphenodont fauna, composed of {{several kinds of}} reptiles, non-mammalian synapsids, and mammals. Six isolated molariform teeth from <b>Pant</b> 4 and 5 fissures clearly record the presence of Thomasia (Mammalia, Allotheria, Haramiyidae), a genus previously known only from purported Late Triassic faunas of southwestern England, France, Belgium, Luxemburg, Germany, and Switzerland. Small morphological differences from teeth in the larger English and continental European samples warrant identification of the Welsh material as Thomasia cf. moorei. The highly derived morphology of an isolated molariform tooth from <b>Pant</b> 5 fissure indicates the presence of another, possibly allotherian, taxon. Fossilien aus zwei wahrscheinlich unterjurassischen Spaltenfüllungen (<b>Pant</b> 4 und <b>Pant</b> 5) im Steinbruch <b>Pant</b> in Süd-Wales dokumentieren eine taxonomisch diverse Wirbeltierfauna. Diese Morganucodon-Sphenodontiden -Fauna besteht aus verschiedenen Formen von Reptilien, Synapsiden und Säugetieren. Sechs isolierte molariforme Zähne aus den Spaltenfüllungen <b>Pant</b> 4 und <b>Pant</b> 5 belegen eindeutig das Vorkommen von Thomasia (Mammalia, Allotheria, Haramiyidae), einer bisher nur aus vermutlich obertriassischen Faunen Südwest-Englands, Frankreichs, Belgiens, Luxemburgs, Deutschlands und der Schweiz bekannten Gattung. Geringe morphologische Unterschiede zu dem umfangreicheren Material aus England und Kontinental-Europa sprechen für die Identifikation des neuen Materials als Thomasia cf. moorei. Die stark abgeleitete Morphologie eines isolierten molariformen Zahnes aus der Spalte <b>Pant</b> 5 belegt das Vorkommen eines anderen Taxons, das möglicherweise auch den Allotheria zuzuordnen ist. doi: 10. 1002 /mmng. 200600018 </a...|$|R
