The {{purpose of this paper}} was to systematically identify and review techniques and interventions proven to <b>prevent</b> <b>or</b> <b>avoid</b> inappropriate enrolment {{of patients}} into RCTs. Methods EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Methodology Register, online abstract repositories, and conference websites were searched. Experts were contacted and bibliographies of retrieved papers hand-searched. The search cut-off date was 31 August 2009. Results No primary publications were found. We identified one study in the grey literature (conference abstracts and presentations) reporting the results of an evaluation of the effectiveness of an intervention designed to <b>prevent</b> <b>or</b> <b>avoid</b> inappropriate enrolment of patients into an RCT. In the context of a multicentre trial, use of a dummy enrolment run-in phase was shown to reduce enrolment errors significantly (P Conclusions Our systematic search yielded only one technique or intervention shown to improve adherence to eligibility criteria during enrolment into RCTs.

40|$|In a {{democratic}} country like South Africa where the Constitution is the supreme law, governance entails {{enforcement of the}} basic principle of public participation. In practice, though, public participation appears to have remained a pipe dream, especially {{in the sphere of}} service delivery. Hence, the service delivery protests are increasingly linked to the apparent voicelesness of people in the decision-making processes. Theoretically, the fierce and often violent service delivery protests could be <b>prevented</b> <b>or</b> <b>avoided</b> by enforcing meaningful public participation in decisions about municipal priorities. This paper makes a theoretical argument about the association between public participation and service delivery in order to insinuate that public anger breeds on the sense of voicelessness among community members.

40|$|Conflicts of {{interest}} (COI) {{in the university}} context are receiving growing attention, but the focus has been largely on problematic financial COI arising from university-industry relations, which clearly need to be avoided. The result, unfortunately, is a pejorative perception of COI as being equivalent to fraud and thus an issue of academic misconduct. In this paper, {{the aim is to}} show that while some financial and non-financial COI are particularly problematic and so should be avoided, many are pervasive and actually the norm in academia even if they are still largely ignored and misunderstood. Through a reflection on my own experiences as a university professor, I describe a diversity of common financial, non-financial and institutional COI of varying degrees of risk, that arise in the day-to-day activities of a professor, in order to then consider how these COI can and should be managed in practice. It is essential to attend to the full range of COI and to think about appropriate policies, procedures, or guidelines to prohibit some COI and mitigate the risks of others; but these “hard” mechanisms {{are only part of the}} solution.

40|$|Tree grids {{and tree}} rings pose certain {{challenges}} to the designer of landscapes especially designing hard landscapes such as pavements, parking areas and roadsides. One challenge is insufficient knowledge of lateral growth space required by tree stems over time. Inappropriate size selection may cause damage to tree rings, tree grids and trees, resulting in costly repairs and unsightly landscape features. Lack of a rigorous knowledge base may prevent the designer or urban forester from choosing appropriate ring or grid sizes. However, these situations may be <b>prevented</b> <b>or</b> <b>avoided</b> should the choices be based on scientific knowledge of tree stem growth rates. This paper {{presents the results of}} an investigation of stem growth rates of three indigenous savannah street trees species growing in the City of Pretoria, Gauteng Province, South Africa. The stem diameters of each species were measured at ground level. Random stratified sampling was conducted, with the total sample size being 282, the oldest tree being more than 46 years of age. Stem diameter was regressed on tree age to compute estimated stem diameter growth rates. Thereafter comparisons were made to rings found in the local landscape industry. The differences in growth rates showed that Combretum erytrophyllum, Searsia lancea and Searsia pendulina will outgrow small tree grids in approximately 10. 75, 18. 50, and 15. 50 years, respectively. The paper suggests that the statistical analysis and modelling of field data increase certainty for design parameters, enhancing the excellence of urban landscapes and forests.

The primary purpose of this research was to explore school principals’ perception of progressive disciplinary procedures for educators. The study adopted a qualitative approach that used inductive data analysis techniques. Some findings were that most principals do not apply progressive discipline consistently and were ambiguous about the effect of the process on educator conduct. Many were threatened and intimidated when using the procedure. This was aggravated by delays in completing the formal process. Principals prefer the least adversarial approach in progressive discipline practice. They spend much time monitoring to <b>prevent</b> <b>or</b> <b>avoid</b> the disciplinary procedure and deviate from the procedure to cope with their anxieties and concern for relations with staff...|$|R

Environmental Defensive Expenditures are not borne to increase households' welfare, but to <b>prevent</b> <b>or</b> <b>avoid</b> {{the effects of a}} worsening environmental quality. The literature on environmental accounting argues that economic growth in industrialized countries is accompanied by an increasing load of defensive activities that may lead to a reorientation of consumption behaviour. In this work this hypothesis is tested using annual data on mean consumption expenditures of Italian households from 1985 to 1996. A complete system of demand is estimated and short-run price elasticities of demand for Defensive Expenditures are calculated. The complete system of demand functions is specified using the Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System proposed by Banks, Blundell and Lewbel. Results show that there is very low substitution between the demand for the six aggregate goods in which total expenditure is here divided and the Environmental Defensive Expenditures. Thus it seems that an increase in Environmental Defensive Expenditures, driven by a change in environmental quality, would not lead to a change in the consumption pattern, {{at least as far as}} Italian households are concerned. ...|$|R

As teachers enter the profession, they encounter a range of new challenges and responsibilities {{as they attempt to}} establish a professional identity within the school culture (McCormack & Thomas, 2003). Accompanying feelings of enthusiasm and eagerness are feelings of stress and anxiety as they face the challenge of being on their own in the classroom without supervision. Beginning teachers are put to the ultimate test as they are expected to take on the same responsibilities as experienced teachers; often being allocated the least desirable and most difficult classes to teach (Carter & Francis, 2001). It should come as no surprise, then, that novice teachers are vulnerable to stress and burnout. There are however, marked individual differences in the way teachers respond to their early years of teaching. Whilst some choose to exit the profession, others develop a set of coping strategies to deal with the complex tasks of being a full-time teacher (McCormack & Thomas, 2003).

The continuing increase of mean age of HIV-infected population, plus the existing, sometimes unmodifiable risk factors for cardiovascular, dysmetabolic, and renal disorders, plus the adjunct of anecdotal illnesses prompting the resort to different drugs and medications, either prescribed for HIV infection itself, or taken for concurrent or subsequent diseases, or self-prescribed occasionally due to an intercurrent, trivial disorders per se, may prompt a complicated scenario culminating with a life-threatening acute renal failure of tubular origin.

This article reports a study of evaluation by describing how readers monitor the concerns of characters {{over the course of a}} narrative. The main hypothesis is that readers tract the well-being via the expression of a character's internal states. Reader evaluations were revealed in think aloud protocols obtained during reading of narrative texts, one sentence at a time. Five kinds of evaluative inferences were found: appraisals (good versus bad), preferences (like versus don't like), emotions (happy versus frustrated), goals (want versus don't want), or purposes (to attain or maintain X versus to <b>prevent</b> <b>or</b> <b>avoid</b> X). Readers evaluated all sentences. The mean rate of evaluation per sentence was 0. 55. Positive and negative evaluations over the course of the story indicated that things initially went badly for characters, improved with the formulation and execution of goal plans, declined with goal failure, and improved as characters formulated new goals and succeeded. The kind of evaluation made depended upon the episodic category of the event and the event's temporal location in the story. Evaluations also served to explain or predict events. In making evaluations, readers stayed within the frame of the story and perspectives of the character or narrator. They also moved out of the narrative frame and addressed evaluations towards the experimenter in a communicative context...|$|R
