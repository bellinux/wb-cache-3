5|$|Todd is briefly {{questioned}} {{about his relationship}} with Dussander, but he manages to convince the police that he knew nothing of the old man's true identity. At the hospital, Dussander hears a group of Neo-Nazis demonstrating outside the hospital; realizing his identity has been hopelessly compromised, he commits suicide by giving himself an air embolism. When French learns that the man who met Todd at school was not Todd's grandfather but a war criminal, he confronts Todd, who then blackmails him into silence by threatening to accuse him of making inappropriate sexual advances towards him, and to thereby expose him publicly as a homosexual and <b>pederast.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shaw wrote The Christening, {{his only}} novel, in 1975. It centres around Miles Madgwick, who {{believes}} that he is bisexual but is too timid to find out through physical intercourse, so he instead describes his most intimate thoughts in his diary. He then meets a married woman named Alice and her son, Rodney; he comes to identify with Rodney's childhood innocence, and in Alice sees a symbol both {{of his mother and}} a heterosexual lover. Alice starts to tire of her husband and grow fonder of Madgwick, who experiences mixed emotions in his continued interactions with her and Rodney. One night, Rodney stays overnight at Madgwick's house and, when he takes the boy home in a taxicab, the driver observes their strange behaviour and accuses Madgwick of being a <b>pederast.</b> When Alice asks Madgwick to become the godfather to her new child, the driver threatens to expose Madgwick, creating a conflict between losing his first feelings of intimacy with others or facing humiliation and ridicule at the driver's exposure.|$|E

500|$|Some modern authors {{suggest that}} Druitt was {{dismissed}} {{because he was}} a homosexual or <b>pederast</b> and that may have driven him to suicide. One speculation is that the money found on his body was going to be used for payment to a blackmailer. Others, however, think that {{there is no evidence of}} homosexuality and that his suicide was instead precipitated by an hereditary psychiatric illness. His mother suffered from depression and was institutionalised from July 1888. She died in an asylum in Chiswick in 1890. His maternal grandmother committed suicide while insane, his aunt attempted suicide., and his eldest sister committed suicide in old age. A note written by Druitt and addressed to his brother William, who was a solicitor in Bournemouth, was found in Druitt's room in Blackheath. It read, [...] "Since Friday I felt that I was going to be like mother, and the best thing for me was to die." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several authors {{believe that}} despite his {{marriage}} Bacon was primarily {{attracted to the}} same sex.

[...] The well-connected antiquary John Aubrey noted in his Brief Lives concerning Bacon, [...] "He was a <b>Pederast.</b> His Ganimeds and Favourites tooke Bribes".

2500|$|In London, Burroughs {{had begun}} to write {{what would become the}} first novel of a trilogy, {{published}} as Cities of the Red Night (1981), The Place of Dead Roads (1983), and The Western Lands (1987). Grauerholz helped edit Cities when it was first rejected by Burroughs's long-time editor Dick Seaver at Holt Rinehart, after it was deemed too disjointed. The novel was written as a straight narrative and then chopped up into a more random pattern, leaving the reader to sort through the characters and events. This technique differed from the author's earlier cut-up methods, which were accidental from the start. Nevertheless, the novel was reassembled and published, still without a straight linear form, but with fewer breaks in the story. The trilogy featured time-travel adventures in which Burroughs's narrators rewrote episodes from history to reform mankind. Reviews were mixed for Cities. Novelist and critic Anthony Burgess panned the work in Saturday Review, saying Burroughs was boring readers with repetitive episodes of <b>pederast</b> fantasy and sexual strangulation that lacked any comprehensible world view or theology; other reviewers, like J. G. Ballard, argued that Burroughs was shaping a new literary [...] "mythography".|$|E
2500|$|Through the {{determined}} {{efforts of}} future Nobel Prize winner for Literature Octavio Paz, {{who at the}} time was in Mexico's diplomatic service, Los olvidados was chosen to represent Mexico at the Cannes Film Festival of 1951, and Paz promoted the film assiduously by distributing a supportive manifesto and parading outside the cinema with a placard. [...] Opinion in general was enthusiastic, with the Surrealists (Breton and poet Jacques Prevert) and other artistic intellectuals (painter Marc Chagall and poet/dramatist/filmmaker Jean Cocteau) laudatory, but the communists objected to what they saw as the film's [...] "bourgeois morality" [...] for containing a scene in which the police stop a <b>pederast</b> from assaulting a child. [...] Buñuel won the Best Director prize that year at Cannes, and also won the FIPRESCI International Critics' Award. [...] After receiving these accolades, the film was reissued in Mexico where it ran for two months to much greater acceptance and profit. [...] Los olvidados and its triumph at Cannes made Buñuel an instant world celebrity and the most important Spanish-speaking film director in the world. [...] In 2003, Los olvidados was recommended by UNESCO for inclusion in the Memory of the World Register, calling it: [...] "the most important document in Spanish about the marginal lives of children in contemporary large cities".|$|E
2500|$|The Warren Cup is a {{piece of}} convivial silver, usually dated to the time of the Julio-Claudian dynasty (1st century AD), that depicts two scenes of male-male sex. It has been argued that the two sides of this cup {{represent}} the duality of pederastic tradition at Rome, the Greek in contrast to the Roman. On the [...] "Greek" [...] side, a bearded, mature man is mounted by a young but muscularly developed male in a rear-entry position. The young man, probably meant to be 17 or 18, holds on to a sexual apparatus for maintaining an otherwise awkward or uncomfortable sexual position. A child-slave watches the scene furtively through a door ajar. The [...] "Roman" [...] side of the cup shows a puer delicatus, age 12 to 13, held for intercourse in the arms of an older male, clean-shaven and fit. The bearded <b>pederast</b> may be Greek, with a partner who participates more freely and with a look of pleasure. His counterpart, who has a more severe haircut, appears to be Roman, and thus uses a slave boy; the myrtle wreath he wears symbolizes his role as an [...] "erotic conqueror". The cup may have been designed as a conversation piece to provoke the kind of dialogue on ideals of love and sex that took place at a Greek symposium. The antiquity of the Warren Cup has been challenged, and it may instead represent perceptions of Greco-Roman homosexuality {{at the time of its}} manufacture, possibly the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries.|$|E

2500|$|In 184 BC Flamininus was {{expelled}} from the Senate by the Censor, Cato the Elder, reportedly for unbecoming conduct during his consulship. In a speech before the Senate, Cato accused Flamininus {{of a number of}} charges, including being a <b>pederast,</b> a practice which he had picked up in Greece. Cato reported that during his consulship, Flamininus took his mistress with him to the north of Italy. Whilst there, a noble Boii and his family sought sanctuary in Flamininus’ tent. As the mistress had often told Flamininus that she had never seen a man die, the consul turned to her and asked her whether she wanted to see a Gaul die. The Boii noble was still speaking through an interpreter when Flamininus ordered his lictor to behead the Boii noble. However Anthony Everitt provides a different possible version of events. On page 305 of his book The Rise of Rome he says that Flamininus had been jokingly enticed by his young male lover and prostitute, Phillipus the Carthaginian, to make up for dragging Phillipus away from Rome and missing the Gladiatorial games, upon which Flamininus had a Celt seeking asylum called in and ran him through personally with his gladius. Everitt goes on to explain, on page 448, [...] "There are variations on this story, one being that the boy was a girl, another that the man killed was a condemned criminal rather than a distinguished Celt, a third that the prostitute requested the execution and, finally, that the deed was done by the lictor, not the consul himself. However in his account of the affair, Livy (39 42) claims to have read the speech Cato made about the affair, {{and there is no reason}} to doubt him. Cato's version is likely to be the nearest to the truth." ...|$|E

50|$|The Lex Scantinia (less often Scatinia) is {{a poorly}} {{documented}} ancient Roman law that penalized a sex crime (stuprum) against a freeborn male minor (ingenuus or praetextatus).

It was thus aimed at protecting the citizen's body from sexual abuse (stuprum), but did not prohibit homosexual behavior as such, as long as the passive partner was not a citizen in good standing.
