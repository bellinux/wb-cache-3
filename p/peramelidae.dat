50|$|The {{placement}} of bilbies within the Peramelemorphia {{has changed in}} recent years. Vaughan (1978) and Groves and Flannery (1990) both placed this family within the family <b>Peramelidae.</b> Kirsch et al.

5000|$|Classification {{within the}} Peramelemorphia {{used to be}} simple. There {{were thought to be}} two {{families}} in the order—the short-legged and mostly herbivorous bandicoots, and the longer-legged, nearly carnivorous bilbies. In recent years, however, it has become clear that the situation is more complex. First, the bandicoots of the New Guinean and far-northern Australian rainforests were deemed distinct from all other bandicoots and were grouped together in the separate family Peroryctidae. More recently, the bandicoot families were reunited in <b>Peramelidae,</b> with the New Guinean species split into four genera in two subfamilies, Peroryctinae and Echymiperinae, while the [...] "true bandicoots" [...] occupy the subfamily Peramelinae. The only exception is the now extinct pig-footed bandicoot, which has been given its own family, Chaeropodidae.|$|E
50|$|The eastern barred {{bandicoot}} is {{most closely}} related to the other species of bandicoot in its genus, of which only two species are still extant today. These surviving relatives are the western barred bandicoot (P. bougainville) and the long-nosed bandicoot (P. nastua). It is also {{closely related to}} the desert bandicoot of the same genus, but this species has become extinct. There are about 20 other bandicoots in the same family, <b>Peramelidae.</b> They share similar features of long pointed snouts, and small ears. The bandicoots are {{closely related to the}} bilbies, which share the same order, Peramelemorphia. These are all from the infraclass Marsupialia, shared of course with other species such as koalas and kangaroos, which means they diverged from the other placental mammals about 100 million years ago.|$|E

The status of Neodiplostomum minor, N. flabelliformis, N. intermedius, N. sarcophilus, N. diaboli and Pharyngostomoides dasyuri is reviewed.

40|$|A {{review of}} {{birthing}} in marsupials {{shows that there}} are at least three distinct methods. In the opossums (Didelphidae), possums, and kangaroos (Phalangeroidea), the expelled newborns crawl from the urogenital sinus to the pouch. In the bandicoots (<b>Peramelidae),</b> the expelled newborn remain attached to the placenta via the umbilical cord while they swim from the urogenital sinus to the pouch. In the carnivorous Dasyuridae, the newborn are expelled in a column of viscous fluid in which they “swim up” to the tunnel between the urogenital sinus and the pouch and then move to the pouch. Some of the recent anatomical studies, on the relative development of the neural system in newborn marsupials and on the behaviours of the newborns within the three birthing methods, have reawakened interest in the mechanisms that might be used to find the pouch. The motor patterns occurring in the newborn marsupials have many similarities to the motor patterns that appear in eutherian embryos at these same developmental stages. Studies that correlate the motor behaviours with the sensory and neural development of newborn marsupials could have important benefits for the understanding of the early organization of behaviour in mammals in general...|$|E

40|$|The diet of dingoes (Canis familiaris dingo) in the Australian Wet Tropics was {{examined}} by analyzing 383 dingo scats collected {{throughout the region}} {{for the presence of}} mammal prey remains. The scats yielded 29 native and 4 introduced mammal prey species from 14 families. The most important species in terms of percentage occurrence in the scats were Melomys cervinipes (22. 2 %), hoodon macrourus (17. 0 %), Perameles nasuta (12. 5 %), and Thylogale stigmatica (12. 5 %). The most important families were Muridae (37. 1 %), <b>Peramelidae</b> (29. 5 %), and Macropodidae (25. 8 %). Examination of small-scale habitat preferences revealed species that preferentially use the forest edge ranked significantly higher in the diet than those that do not, and species that are terrestrial ranked higher in the diet than those that are arboreal. Relative abundance was also a significant factor in the ranked dietary occurrence of each species, with abundant species ranked significantly higher than those that are less abundant.

40|$|Bandicoots and bilbies (Peramelemorphia) {{represent}} a distinct lineage within the marsupial adaptive radiation, which despite several curious anatomical traits has received little morphological attention. Many bandicoot species (family <b>Peramelidae)</b> dig for subterranean food, while bilbies (family Thylacomyidae) employ their forelimbs to dig extensive burrow systems for shelter. In the current study, dissections {{of the southern}} brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus) (n≤ 7) and greater bilby (Macrotis lagotis) (n≤ 4) provide the first anatomical descriptions of forelimb musculature in these species. The anatomical arrangement of forelimb muscles in I. obesulus and M. lagotis {{differs from that of}} other marsupials and corresponds to the aclaviculate pectoral girdle and modified arrangement of digits in the study species. Comparative and functional interpretations indicate that the forelimb of I. obesulus is well equipped for scratch digging and demonstrates muscular modifications in order to generate large out-forces. The bones of the forelimb, and in particular the antebrachium, are relatively short, stout bones, improving both their resistance to mechanical forces and providing a mechanical advantage via a reduced out-lever length. There has been an increase in the absolute volume of muscles employed during digging, thereby increasing the magnitude of the in-force. Increased in-lever lengths have been achieved via the migration of muscle insertions, including the elongate olecranon for the insertion of the m. triceps brachii, and the distal migration of the humeral attachments of the teres major, latissimus dorsi and superficial pectoral muscles...|$|E
40|$|Animals that forage {{for food}} or dig burrows by biopedturbation {{can alter the}} biotic and abiotic {{characteristics}} of their habitat. The digging activities of such ecosystem engineers, although small at a local scale, may be important for broader scale landscape processes by influencing soil and litter properties, trapping organic matter and seeds, and subsequently altering seedling recruitment. We examined environmental characteristics (soil moisture content, hydrophobicity and litter composition) of foraging pits created by the southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus; <b>Peramelidae),</b> a digging Australian marsupial, over a 6 -month period. Fresh diggings typically contained a higher moisture content and lower hydrophobicity than undisturbed soil. A month later, foraging pits contained greater amounts of fine litter and lower amounts of coarse litter than adjacent undug surfaces, indicating that foraging pits may provide a conducive microhabitat for litter decomposition, potentially reducing litter loads and enhancing nutrient decomposition. We tested whether diggings might affect seedling recruitment (seed removal by seed harvesters and seed germination rates) by artificially mimicking diggings. Although {{there were no differences}} in the removal of seeds, seedling recruitment for three native plant species (Acacia saligna, Kennedia prostrata and Eucalyptus gomphocephala) was higher in plots containing artificial diggings compared with undug sites. The digging actions of bandicoots influenced soil moisture and hydrophobicity, the size distribution of litter and seedling recruitment at a local scale. The majority of Australian digging mammals are threatened, with many suffering substantial population and range contraction. However, their persistence in landscapes {{plays an important role in}} maintaining the health and function of ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|Endocrinology of the oestrous cycle, {{pregnancy}} and early lactation {{was investigated in}} captive Western Australian greater bilbies (Macrotis lagotis). Initially, six females were monitored for changes in urogenital cytology, plasma progestogen, pericloacal and pouch morphology {{in the absence of}} a male. This was followed by the introduction of a male and a reproductive assessment through mating, gestation and early lactation. In the absence of a male, there was no cyclical pattern of urogenital cytology, pericloacal or pouch development, and progestogen concentrations remained basal. Within 5 days of the introduction of a male, all females had a karyopycnotic index of 100 %. Spermatozoa were present in the urogenital smear within 3 days of male introduction in all five females that gave birth. Five to 9 days after the introduction of a male, there was an increase in plasma progestogen concentration that remained elevated for 14 - 19 days. Six of the seven females gave birth approximately 3 days after reaching peak plasma progestogen concentrations. Gestation length ranged between 14 and 17 days. Plasma progestogen concentrations of the postpartum and early lactation period were lower (P < 0. 0001) than during gestation, but greater (P < 0. 0001) than those recorded before the introduction of a male. One female that gave birth early in the study that was examined until weaning of the pouch young showed a cyclical pattern of plasma progestogen secretion that ended at weaning. This study provides evidence that the luteal phase in the greater bilby is induced by the presence of a male. Similar to female reproductive physiology in the <b>Peramelidae,</b> elevated progestogen concentration in the greater bilby was extended into lactation...|$|E
40|$|The {{degree to}} which females {{allocate}} resources between current reproduction, future fecundity and survival is a central theme in life history theory. We investigated two hypotheses proposed to explain patterns of reproductive investment, terminal investment and senescence, by examining the effects of maternal traits (age and maternal mass) on annual fecundity in female northern brown bandicoots, Isoodon macrourus (Marsupialia: <b>Peramelidae).</b> We found that annual fecundity in females declined in their final year of reproduction, indicating reproductive senescence. Maternal mass significantly influenced the rate of senescence and, in turn, a female's lifetime reproductive output. Mass {{had little effect on}} fecundity in 1 st and 2 nd year females, but a positive relationship with fecundity in 3 rd year females. This meant that heavy, 3 rd year females did not suffer the decline in fecundity shown in light 3 rd year females. For 1 st year females, mass and leg length increased between their first and second reproductive seasons, indicating a temporary shift, from the allocation of resources to reproduction, to increasing condition or structural size post their first breeding event. There were no net changes to body mass in subsequent years. We suggest that this year of post-reproductive growth has important consequences for senescent effects on reproduction. Overall, results provided support for the effects of senescence on annual fecundity. Our findings were not consistent with the terminal investment hypothesis; reproductive output did not increase in females' final reproductive season despite a rapid decline in survival. However, this notion cannot be entirely dismissed; other measures of reproductive performance not examined here (e. g. offspring mass) may have provided an indication that females did increase their effort {{at the end of their}} lifespan. This study highlights the difficulty of measuring reproductive costs and the importance of understanding the combined effects of specific characteristics of an individual when interpreting reproductive strategies in iteroparous organisms...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{behaviour}} and ecology of marsupials has been a neglected area of research {{for a long time}} and few quantitative studies of this subject have been undertaken to date. However, recently (particularly during the past twenty years), there has been a recrudescence of interest in these spheres of investigation as the ensuing review of the relevant literature shall demonstrate, although the amount of this research-effort is still meagre in comparison with the volume of information published about many species of eutherian mammals. This neglect of research on marsupials is both surprising and unfortunate, as marsupials are widely distributed, occupy all of the major habitats occurring in Australia and have adapted diverse modes of life almost, if not precisely comparable in variety to that of analogous eutherian mammals occupying comparable ecological niches. Earlier studies on marsupials were of a comparative nature often specifically dealing with differences between metatherian and eutherian mammals. In addition, these investigations mainly concentrated on only a few species, particularly the larger members of the family Macropodidae (the kangaroos and wallabies) and the Virginia opossum, Didelphis marsupialis. Research-activities were further limited by the fact that these studies were largely centred on reproduction, a process of considerable importance in view of its uniqueness in marsupials. It is the above factors and the fact that the majority of other marsupials are nocturnal, timid and cryptic, (rendering investigations difficult, particularly in the field) that have resulted in the paucity of behavioural and ecological information available on the numerous diverse groups of the sub-class Metatheria. As previously mentioned, D. marsupialis has received considerable attention, being the only specie of marsupial endemic to North America. Investigations have covered behavioural characteristics and seasonal changes in behaviour (McManus 1970, 1971), the daily activity cycle (Bombardieri and Johnson 1969) and population density and movement patterns (Holmes and Sanderson 1965; Shirer and Fitch 1970). Studies on the family Macropodidae have included observations on daily activities and social behaviour of Macropus rufus (Frith 1964; Russell 1970 a; Croft 1981 a), agonistic encounters and social behaviour in M. giganteus (Grant 1973; Kaufmann 1975) and locomotion in several species of the larger macropods (Windsor and Dagg 1971; Alexander and Vernon 1975). Locomotion has also been observed in the genus Potorous by Buchmann and Guiler (1974). Russell and Pearce (1971) studied the investigation of novel objects by selected species of four marsupial families, of which two species belonged to the family Macropodidae and 2 one to the family <b>Peramelidae.</b> Observations have been made in captivity on the quokka (Setonix brachyurus), the pademelon (Thylogale billardierii) and the burrowing bettong (Bettongia lesueuri) by Packer (1969), Morton and Burton (1973) and Stodart (1966), respectively and Kitchener (1973) has investigated the home ranges and movements of S. brachyurus and P. apicalis. By comparison, all of the other families of marsupials have received scant attention. Studies on the family Dasyuridae have been mainly concerned with prey-killing and feeding behaviour in Dasycercus cristicauda (Ewer 1969) and in Sarcophilus harrisii (Buchmann and Guiler 1977). Hutson (1975) investigated sequences of prey-catching in Dasyuroides byrnei and in 1976 he also presented an account of maintenance activities in the same species, as did Moss (unpubl.) in a study of Dasyurus viverrinus. The ecology of S. harrisii was described by Green (1967) and its home range and movements by Guiler (1970 a). The smaller representatives of the family have received some attention in that investigations of certain aspects of the behaviour and ecology of Antechinus stuartii, A. minimus and A. swainsonii have been conducted by Marlow (1961), Braithwaite (1974, 1979), Hocking (unpubl.) and Haynes (in press). Hall (1980) studied the diets of two sympatric species of Antechinus. Finally, the family <b>Peramelidae</b> (bandicoots), forming the subject of the present investigation, has received a small amount of attention with respect to their behaviour and ecology. Lyne (1964 a) and Stodart (1966 a) studied the breeding of Perameles nasuta in captivity. Heinsohn (1966) and Braithwaite and Gullan (1978) investigated the ecology of P. gunnii and Isoodon obesulus. Reproduction was also studied in I. macrourus (Mackerras and Smith 1960; Lyne 1974) and observations on the behaviour of the same species were undertaken by Day, Kirkby and Stenhouse (1974) using an open field arena. Activity-patterns and social behaviour were analysed in I. obesulus (Watts 1974, O'Callaghan, unpubl.) as were ranging movements in I. macrourus (Gordon 1974). Discrimination-reversal learning in I. obesulus was investigated by Buchmann and Grecian (1974) and studies of other behavioural and ecological aspects undertaken included burrowing in I. obesulus (Kirsch 1968), feeding and foraging in I. macrourus (Anon. 1970), the status of P. gunnii in Victoria (Seebeck 1979) and grooming in I. macrourus (Clarke and Clarke 1969). Lyne (1951, 1952) described the external characters (particularly of pouch young) of P. gunnii and four other species of bandicoots and Stoddart and Braithwaite (1979) made a {{study of the}} utilization of regenerating heathland habitats by I. obesulus. In view of the relative lack of detailed information on members of the family <b>Peramelidae</b> the present investigation was undertaken to examine two distinctive but comparable species of the family. Heinsohn (1966) described the same two species, Isoodon obesulus and Perameles gunnii as being sympatric. Consequently this study is an attempt to provide quantitative data on four specific aspects of their behaviour and ecology, in order to acquire a general appreciation of the relationship of the two species to their environment and to each other. The aspects investigated were maintenance activities (Chapter 3), feeding behaviour and diet (Chapter 4), home ranges and habitat utilization (Chapter 5) and intra- and inter-specific interactions (Chapter 6). It was hoped and is the avowed aim of this study, that a comparison of these aspects may assist in explaining why these two species are able to co-exist in the same habitat while presumably utilizing somewhat similar resources...|$|E
