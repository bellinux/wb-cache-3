Keating and as a substantive law act following Southland. It discusses the Erie doctrine as applicable to federal courts and state law <b>preemption.</b> The <b>article</b> concludes that Southland by-passed Erie using the Commerce Clause and the Supremacy Clause to create a federal common law of arbitration...|$|R

The dialect is most noticeable in speech than in writing, such as f and x are allophones, (e.g., Juana is pronounced /fana/), {{especially when it}} is next to one or semivowel. (Los fríos de San Juan; Los fríos de San Fän), the double preposing and possessive genitive (De Antonio sus amigos; From Antonio his friends), and the <b>preemption</b> of <b>articles</b> against the names (Juana, Lä Fuana). There are also other languages spoken as Iquito, Yagua, Ese Ejja, or other native languages in Loreto, and foreign languages like English and French because of increasing globalization.|$|R
40|$|The {{imminent}} {{prospect of}} federal climate change legislation raises two questions: will {{state and local}} governments continue to press forward with climate change initiatives in the wake of congressional action and, if so, what is the likelihood these initiatives will survive the threat of federal <b>preemption?</b> The <b>article</b> concludes that state and local action on climate change is motivated only in part by the federal government's failure to adopt a national climate regulatory program and hence is likely to continue and perhaps even intensify. While a cap and trade program is likely to preempt state regulation of emissions allowances, it is unlikely to preempt many of the climate initiatives being pursued. However, the effect upon existing regional cap and trade regimes remains the biggest question mark. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
40|$|This Article first {{examines}} the problem currently facing the appellate courts {{as to whether}} a party may initially raise ERISA preemption after trial or on appeal. The Article then reviews the various approaches to the problem by the appellate courts. Next, the <b>Article</b> {{examines the}} <b>preemption</b> principle enunciated by the Supreme Court under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) that some appellate courts regard as dispositive. The Article then explores {{the failure of the}} appellate courts to follow the ERISA mandate. Finally, the Article outlines the analysis appellate courts should conduct relating the legislative intent to the procedural effect of ERISA preemption in answering the question of whether a party can waive the <b>preemption.</b> This <b>Article</b> asserts that ERISA preemption is jurisdictional and, therefore, may be raised {{for the first time on}} appeal. This approach gives ERISA preemption the same procedural effect as NLRA preemption and preserves a uniform federal common law with respect to employee benefit plans, thereby encouraging the growth of private employee benefit plans...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{interest}} in consumerism has brought intensified efforts {{at every level}} of government to protect the consumer. While federal regulation seems desirable for nationally marketed products and interstate activities, the states retain the duty to protect {{the health and safety of}} their citizens. Where state regulation is more restrictive than concurrent federal regulation, however, the constitutional issue of <b>preemption</b> arises. This <b>Article</b> analyzes the factors which have influenced the courts in resolving conflicts between federal and state regulation in the consumer field. Emphasizing the need for concurrent regulation, the author formulates guidelines by which the courts can examine the purposes and extent of consumer protection by competing governmental entities to resolve the issue of preemption...|$|R
40|$|In this Article, Professor Drummonds {{examines}} {{the division of}} workplace regulatory authority between {{the states and the}} federal government. The Article first explores the decline of the New Deal system of collective bargaining and reviews the debates ignited by this decline. It then reviews the role of state law in regulating the workplace, and illustrates the complex relationship between federal and state law in the workplace by examining reductions in coverage for AIDS in employer-provided group medical plans. The Article sets forth a framework and theory for deciding federal-state authority issues. It analyzes traditional preemption doctrine and recent Supreme Court decisions outside of labor and employment law, and then applies these lessons to preemption doctrine in employment law, urging congressional revision of ERISA 2 ̆ 7 s preemption provisions, and judicial abrogation of current Federal Arbitration Act <b>preemption</b> doctrine. The <b>Article</b> concludes by recommending major revisions in the primary preemption doctrines that evolved out of the New Deal-era statutes concerning unionized employees...|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} regulatory gaps that are created through imprecise preemption rulings. It begins with a detailed case study of how railroads were able to enter the highly regulated solid waste industry, to claim that all state oversight is preempted by a federal statute intended to deregulate railroad economics, and to obtain the economic benefits of operating in a regulatory gap. The net result of current preemption doctrine in those cases has been to strip citizens of the power to ensure that waste transfer stations are safe, and this fundamental injustice serves as a backdrop to analyzing current preemption jurisprudence. The Court’s reliance on a presumption against preemption of state laws to interpret federal statutes has declined over time, and this article provides an additional explanation for the presumption’s decline based upon flaws in the original formulation of the doctrine. The article also explores the Court’s current use of regulatory gaps as marking the plausible limits of Congressional intent to preempt, particularly {{when faced with the}} preclusion of all tort remedies for individual victims, and argues that the Court’s concern about regulatory gaps should extend to preventive measures that are also based on the states’ police powers and that are the expression of collective rights of self-protection. In addition to the standard federalism concerns that animate restraints on <b>preemption,</b> the <b>article</b> builds on scholarship that suggests additional Constitutional limitations on Congress’s powers to strip remedies from citizens. Finally, the article proposes to correct these trends through a revitalized presumption against preemption, whereby courts would consider whether a preemption ruling will create a regulatory gap, and in those circumstances should require a clear statement that Congress intended to strip remedies designed to prevent the underlying conduct at issue. Such a prudential rule of construction would avoid potential Constitutional issues...|$|R
40|$|Although a goodly {{amount of}} recent {{commentary}} {{provides guidance to}} practitioners on the pitfalls of perfecting a security interest in intellectual property collateral, and another body of work has undertaken the laudable task of proposing reform in the area, no comprehensive attempt has yet been made to help judges resolve the complex priority disputes that arise under existing law. In light of {{the increased use of}} intellectual property as collateral and the concomitant rise in litigation, guidance on the resolution of priority disputes in intellectual property collateral is sorely needed. For example, recent cases find Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (U. C. C.) to be broadly preempted by federal intellectual property law and create significant differences between the way copyright and patent priority disputes are addressed, without providing a detailed analysis of the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s most recent pronouncement on intellectual property <b>preemption.</b> This <b>Article</b> criticizes these and other cases, provides guidelines for resolving the puzzling priority disputes that arise when intellectual property is taken as collateral, and clearly defines the proper contours of federal preemption. Part I of the Article will review well-established preemption principles, determine whether federal or state rules of decision apply to familiar patterns of dispute involving copyright collateral, and suggest the appropriate result in each case. The conclusions contradict recent academic and judicial discussion of the preemption issue that suggests an inappropriately broad preemptive scope for federal law. The key is not to examine preemption questions in the abstract, but to identify the precise disputes that federal law settles and leave for state law the disputes for which federal law provides no answer. Part II applies the same method of analysis to priority disputes involving patents as collateral and examines whether the current disparate treatment of patents and copyrights is warranted. To round out the discussion, Part III evaluates the effect of the Lanham Act on disputes over security interests taken in trademarks...|$|R
40|$|The Supreme Court has {{developed}} a standard account of the Erie doctrine. The Court has directed different analyses of Erie cases depending upon whether the federal law in question {{is in the form}} of a federal rule (or statute) or is instead a judge-made law. But the cases applying the doctrine are difficult to explain using the standard account. Although the Court and commentators have noted that Erie is a type of preemption, they provide little, if any, rigorous analysis of Erie in light of <b>preemption</b> doctrines. This <b>Article</b> attempts to fill that void, offering an extended analysis of Erie as a preemption doctrine. The analysis demonstrates how and why Erie constitutes a species of preemption. It then shows the appropriateness of preemption analysis to Erie problems whether one is dealing with a federal rule of civil procedure or with federal common law. Because preemption underlies both wings of the Erie doctrine, the standard account’s bifurcated approach is wrong. Moreover, employing doctrines developed in other preemption contexts explains the results of the Supreme Court’s Erie cases better than the Court’s own standard account. By making explicit the linkage between Erie and preemption, one can clarify the analysis and better predict and explain the results of the Supreme Court’s cases...|$|R
40|$|In a {{preemption}} case decided over {{a decade}} ago, Justice Breyer wrote that “in today’s world, filled with legal complexity, the true test of federalist principle may lie... in those many statutory cases where courts interpret the mass of technical detail that is the ordinary diet of the law. ” This article surveys the Roberts Court’s preemption jurisprudence, focusing on five cases decided in OT 2010. Young argues that Justice Breyer was right — that is, that because current federalism jurisprudence largely eschews any effort to define exclusive spheres {{of state and federal}} regulatory jurisdiction, the most important federalism cases involve efforts to determine the preemptive scope of federal legislation. The key doctrinal tool in preemption cases is the “presumption against preemption” — a canon of statutory construction recognized by the Court in the 1947 case of Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp. The Rice presumption is under nearly constant siege today from both litigants and commentators. This article explores the Roberts Court’s use (and non-use) of the presumption and defends the presumption against its academic critics. In particular, the author addresses Caleb Nelson’s important argument that Rice’s presumption is inconsistent with the original meaning of the Supremacy Clause, concluding that Professor Nelson’s historical argument does not rule out the presumption as it is presently applied. Even if the original history did disfavor the presumption, Rice is a necessary doctrinal innovation that balances other developments in federalism doctrine, such as the contemporary Court’s unwillingness to enforce a robust enumerated powers doctrine. Nelson’s argument has a second aspect, however, which would considerably raise the bar for conflict preemption. In a series of separate opinions, Justice Thomas has adopted this approach and rejected the contemporary notion of “purposes and objects” preemption. Young argues that this approach can and should coexist with Rice’s presumption against preemption in express preemption cases, and that in any event one cannot consistently cite Nelson’s historical argument to reject Rice and, at the same time, maintain broad notions of implied <b>preemption.</b> The <b>article</b> concludes with a discussion of the politics of preemption cases, which frequently find conservative and liberal justices reversing their usual stances on federalism. Although a number of factors contribute to this ironic reversal, the fact that federal preemption is generally de-regulatory in its effect. Young suggests that a libertarian theory of federalism favoring widespread preemption is shortsighted, because robust state institutions remain necessary to our system of vertical checks and balances...|$|R
40|$|Conventional wisdom {{holds that}} federal law’s conferring banking powers on {{national}} banks presumptively preempts state laws seeking {{to control the}} exercise of those powers. This conventional wisdom springs from a long-standing legal tradition, originating with McCulloch v. Maryland, that nationally chartered banks are federal instrumentalities entitled to regulate themselves free from state law, even when national law fails to address the risks that state law seeks to regulate. Incorporated into National Bank Act of 1864 by 19 th century precedents but then abandoned by the New Deal Court, McCulloch’s theory of preemption is being revived today by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) to preempt broad swathes of state law. This article maintains {{that it is time}} to exorcise McCulloch’s theory from our preemption jurisprudence. Far from being sanctioned by legal tradition, McCulloch’s theory that national banks are federal instrumentalities offends a deeply rooted tradition in American political culture and law that I call the “anti-banker non-delegation principle. This principle has been manifest in campaigns against national banks’ immunities from political oversight ranging from Andrew Jackson’s 1832 veto of the charter of the Second Bank of the United States message to Louis Brandeis’ 1912 campaign against the “House of Morgan” as a “financial oligarchy. ” Rather than accept McCulloch’s view of banks as impartial instruments of the federal government, the American political system and, since the New Deal, the federal courts, have adopted the view that federal law should not delegate unsupervised power to private banks to determine the honesty, safety, and soundness of their own operations. Accordingly, if federal regulators set aside state laws regulating banking practices, then those federal regulators must explain how federal law addresses the risks the state law attempts to control. The most recent effort to eliminate McCulloch’s theory of preemption, according to this article, § 1044 (a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, which provides detailed standards governing the power of the OCC to preempt state law. This article argues that the OCC’s 2011 rules mistakenly revive McCulloch’s theory of preemption, contradicting not only § 1044 (a) but also the more general tradition of distrusting unsupervised delegations of immunity from state law to national banks. In particular, like McCulloch, the OCC’s rules draw irrational distinctions between states’ general common-law doctrines and states’ rules specifically directed towards banking practices, subjecting the latter to a sort of field preemption. Rather than accept such <b>preemption,</b> this <b>article</b> urges that courts ought to follow the ordinary principles of conflict preemption, barring preemption of state law unless the OCC has specifically approved the banking practice that state law forbids...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{will examine}} the state courts 2 ̆ 7 {{approach}} to FAA preemption on a vacatur motion since the most recent Supreme Court FAA <b>preemption</b> decisions. This <b>Article</b> will demonstrate that, {{with little or no}} analysis, state courts over-apply the FAA to commercial arbitration awards, particularly the 2 ̆ 2 manifest disregard 2 ̆ 2 prong, causing what I call 2 ̆ 2 over-preemption 2 ̆ 2 and frustrating their own state 2 ̆ 7 s interests in the application of its arbitration law. Part II of this Article will briefly review Supreme Court FAA preemption jurisprudence. Part III of this Article will use illustrative state court decisions to demonstrate that the state courts are applying FAA preemption in the vacatur context in an inconsistent manner and thus over-preempt the FAA. Part IV of this Article will show that, even after balancing the competing policy concerns of federalism and judicial uniformity, this 2 ̆ 2 over-preemption 2 ̆ 2 is not required under the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s jurisprudence and that only in very limited circumstances must a state court apply the grounds for vacatur set forth in section 10 of the FAA. Part IV will also demonstrate that state courts need not apply the 2 ̆ 2 manifest disregard 2 ̆ 2 prong as part of the FAA, even if the FAA were held to apply. Part V will conclude by setting forth a framework for state courts to use when considering what law applies to a motion to vacate that takes into account Supreme Court precedent and policy considerations...|$|R
40|$|A long {{tradition}} in legal theory views the judicial role as centrally including {{the duty to}} make the entire body of law “speak with one voice. ” This coherence ideal permeates much {{of the law of}} statutory interpretation, but one body of doctrine that it has particularly influenced is the set of standards that federal courts use to determine when a newly enacted statute overrides preexisting legal rules. Determining whether Congress implicitly intends to preempt state law, repeal previous legislation, or displace federal common law is an increasingly important part of the “ordinary diet of the law. ” And although, this <b>Article</b> maintains, modern <b>preemption</b> doctrine is largely consistent with the presumptive judicial role in statutory interpretation—that of Congress’s faithful agent—the desire for coherence has motivated the Court to develop standards governing repeal and displacement that deviate from the <b>preemption</b> framework. This <b>Article</b> argues that courts should abandon the quest for coherence in statutory interpretation. In a reasonably pluralistic society like ours, widespread agreement on a coherent ranking of basic values is unlikely. Against this backdrop of deep disagreement, collective social action is purchased only by hammering out specific compromises, and the overall pattern of compromises is unlikely to be coherent. Imposing coherence on the body of law accordingly unravels the very compromises that allowed the legislature to act and, in doing so, both disrespects the process of mutual compromise that made collective action possible and impedes future legislative action. Recognizing the importance of compromise to modern legislation should lead to the rejection of normative coherence as an ideal in statutory interpretation. And, absent some other justification for their current divergence, the doctrinal standards for repeal and displacement should be unified with the current preemption framework...|$|R
40|$|Section 301 of the Copyright Act of 1976 {{expressly}} preempts {{state law}} {{actions that are}} within the 2 ̆ 2 general scope of copyright 2 ̆ 2 and that assert claims that are 2 ̆ 2 equivalent to 2 ̆ 2 the rights conferred by the Act. The Act eliminated the previous system of common law copyright for unpublished works, which had prevailed under the prior 1909 Copyright Act. By federalizing copyright law, the drafters of the statute sought to achieve uniformity and to avoid the potential for state protection of infinite duration. The legislative history of § 301 stated that this preemption provision was set forth 2 ̆ 2 in the clearest and most unequivocal language possible, so as to foreclose any conceivable misinterpretation [...] . and to avoid the development of any vague borderline between State and Federal protection. 2 ̆ 2 In fact, this goal has never been realized. Instead, there are literally hundreds {{of federal and state}} decisions interpreting this provision, which can charitably be described as inconsistent and even incoherent. And, despite the plethora of court of appeals decisions that have overruled district court decisions, and/or that have contained strong dissenting opinions, the U. S. Supreme Court has never decided a case under § 301. In short, it would not be an overstatement to describe this important provision in the Copyright Act as a 2 ̆ 2 legislative failure. 2 ̆ 2 This Article first reviews the background of the 1909 and 1976 Acts, including the rationales for copyright protection and the role played by the preemption provision in advancing those goals. This Article canvasses extensively the judicial treatment of § 301, including detailed critiques of many of these decisions. This Article also examines the constitutional aspects of preemption, including the role played by the Supremacy Clause. Most importantly, this Article seeks to provide ways to advance the original goal of the drafters of § 301, of federalizing copyright law, and of affording consistent interpretation of the <b>preemption</b> provisions. This <b>Article</b> continually returns to first principles - the goals of the drafters - and uses them to argue for expanded preemption of many state law claims...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary focus}} of this article is whether California’s forty-year old droit de suite statute; the California Resale Royalty Act (CRRA), is subject to federal {{preemption}} under the Copyright Act. This issue is now being litigated in the Ninth Circuit, and this article concludes that the CRRA is preempted under section 301 (a) of the Copyright Act and under the Supremacy Clause because it at odds with copyright’s well-established first sale doctrine. The basic idea of droit de suite is that each time an artist’s work is resold by a dealer or auction house, the artist is entitled to a royalty, typically five percent, on the resale price even though he or she has not retained copyright to the art object let alone ownership. France has granted its artists this right since the 1920 s, the EU harmonized droit de suite in 2001, and about 70 countries now have resale royalty laws but not the United States even though resale royalty legislation has been introduced in Congress sporadically since the late 1970 s. Resale royalty legislation was introduced in 11 states but California is the only state to have passed such a law. This statute, enacted in 1976, withstood a preemption challenge under the Copyright Act of 1909 in Morseburg v. Balyon, a 1980 ruling by the Ninth Circuit. Everything then remained relatively quiet until 2011 when Sotheby’s and other art dealers were sued by artists seeking their royalties under the statute. The Ninth Circuit ruled in 2015 that the CRRA violated the dormant Commerce Clause by attempting to regulate transactions outside of California but it treated the CRRA’s sections regulating in-state sales as severable. After the U. S. Supreme Court denied certiorari the case was remanded to the U. S. District Court for the Central District of California which held earlier this year in Estate of Robert Graham v. Sotheby’s, Inc. that the remaining sections of the CRRA were preempted under section 301 of the Copyright Act. Notwithstanding the law of the circuit doctrine the court also concluded that recent decisions by the United States Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit had so eroded Morseburg that it no longer represented a binding interpretation of copyright’s first sale doctrine and the California statute. Accordingly, the CRRA was preempted under the Supremacy Clause because it conflicted with first sale. The Estate of Robert Graham decision certainly will be reviewed by the Ninth Circuit and it could eventually find its way to the U. S. Supreme Court. The high court has not addressed a preemption issue in the general field of intellectual property since the Bonito Boats decision in 1989, and it has never addressed a preemption issue arising under section 301 of the Copyright Act of 1976. The {{focus of this article}} is not about whether the United States should implement droit de suite. Rather, it concentrates on two relatively narrow questions: (1) whether the CRRA is preempted under the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause (conflict preemption) because it disrupts Congress’s efforts to balance the interests of copyright right owners and consumers; and, (2) whether it is preempted under section 301 of Copyright Act (express <b>preemption).</b> This <b>article</b> concludes that although the federal district court might have overstated the impact of the U. S. Supreme Court’s first sale decisions and failed to consider several arguments supporting the California statute, it still got things right: California’s droit de suite statute is preempted under section 301 of the Copyright Act and under conflict preemption analysis because it frustrates the purposes of copyright’s wellestablished first-sale doctrine...|$|R
