The same forty-eight statement Q sort was used in two time periods to track movement of communication behavior among members: a <b>pre-sort</b> before the process and a post-sort at the end. Using a public relations theory, the situational theory of publics, as a framework, the Q sort was aligned with the theory's dependent variables of active and passive communication behavior. The data from the completed Q sorts was then entered into the PQMethod software. Four factors were identified in the <b>pre-sort,</b> and two factors were identified in the post-sort. Findings indicate that the four <b>pre-sort</b> groups lacked consensus in their behavior on how to approach problems. However, the two post-sort groups exhibited a change in behavior, showing consistency in their interpretation of problems.

50|$|The {{feedstock}} for plasma {{waste treatment}} {{is most often}} municipal solid waste, organic waste, or both. Feedstocks may also include biomedical waste and hazmat materials. Content and consistency of the waste directly impacts performance of a plasma facility. <b>Pre-sorting</b> and recycling useful material before gasification provides consistency. Too much inorganic material such as metal and construction waste increases slag production, which in turn decreases syngas production. However, a benefit is that the slag itself is chemically inert and safe to handle (certain materials may affect {{the content of the}} gas produced, however). Shredding waste before entering the main chamber helps to increase syngas production. This creates an efficient transfer of energy which ensures more materials are broken down.|$|E
50|$|Techniques for {{improving}} perceived performance may include {{more than just}} decreasing the delay between the user's request and visual feedback. Sometimes an increase in delay can {{be perceived as a}} performance improvement, such as when a variable controlled by the user is set to a running average of the users input. This can give the impression of smoother motion, but the controlled variable always reaches the desired value a bit late. Since it smooths out hi-frequency jitter, when the user is attempting to hold the value constant, they may feel like they are succeeding more readily. This kind of compromise would be appropriate for control of a sniper rifle in a video game. Another example may be doing trivial computation ahead of time rather than after a user triggers an action, such as <b>pre-sorting</b> a large list of data before a user wants to see it.|$|E

50|$|After 1850 {{the small}} and {{scattered}} stamp mills and ore washeries were replaced by central ore dressing plants. The basic steps - coarse crushing - manual separation - sieving - jigging - fine crushing - table work and slime washing - remained much the same. The process was increasingly mechanised and perfected. In 1905 the most modern ore dressing plant in Germany went into operation in Clausthal using the gravity dressing process. It was located near the Ottiliae Shaft {{on the site of}} the old central ore processing plant of 1872. It employed up to 650 workers and processed all ore from the Clausthal and Zellerfeld pits until 1930. A change occurred in the 1920s with the introduction of the froth floatation in Bad Grund and later in Lautenthal. This technique enabled the required production of metal concentration without manual <b>pre-sorting</b> and a much higher yield.

40|$|This {{experimental}} investigation {{examines the}} processes that control the grain-size sorting and geometry of cross strata in dunes and unit bars, in particular the effects of bedform superimposition and flow unsteadiness. Cross stratification formed by dunes and unit bars {{is the most common}} sedimentary structure in river-channel deposits, and is common in many other depositional environments. Previous work by Reesink and Bridge (2007) shows that the grain-size variation that allows cross strata to be recognized is determined by three main factors: (1) <b>pre-sorting</b> by superimposed bedforms and flow unsteadiness; (2) sorting during deposition on the lee slope, and; (3) reworking of the slope by currents in the lee of the bedform. Differences in the relative importance of these three factors cause cross strata to be more varied in their geometry, grain-size sorting and permeability than commonly realized, and provide information for detailed quantitative interpretation of river-channel deposits. The experiments presented in this paper cover a wide range of steady and unsteady flow conditions with different combinations of host and superimposed bedforms. Lee-side deposition was highly variable at the time required for the buildup of cross strata, but systematic variations related to bed morphology provided good indicators of flow conditions. Water currents in the lee-side flow separation zone affect initial deposition on the lee slope and can re-distribute sediment on the lee slope. Centimeter-scale turbulent eddies were observed to increase the tangential shape, decrease the (vertical) grain-size separation, and reduce the thickness of the cross strata. These effects of turbulent eddies were found to increase with increasing flow velocity, decreasing grain size, and decreasing bedform height. Flow unsteadiness was primarily expressed in a change of host and/or superimposed bedform type. The <b>pre-sorting</b> pattern formed by the superimposed bedforms is lost if the <b>pre-sorting</b> involves less sediment than {{the processes that}} re-sort the sediment on the lee slope (e. g. grainflows). If the <b>pre-sorting</b> pattern of the superimposed bedforms can be identified, the cross strata they form can be used to interpret host and superimposed bedform geometries. The presence of reactivation surfaces indicates that superimposed bedform heights (Hs) exceed 25 % of the host bedform height (H; Hs/H > 0. 25). <b>Pre-sorting</b> by superimposed bedforms is recognizable as cross stratification where Hs/H < 0. 25, and comprises: (i) drapes of fine-grained sediment that settles from suspension during the passage of the superimposed trough, and; (ii) a body of coarse-grained bedload with a cross-sectional area that equals the cross-sectional area of the formative superimposed bedform. The distinctiveness and lateral extent of fine-grained drapes represent the distinctiveness and lateral extent of their formative superimposed troughs. The lateral extent and internal grain-size sorting of the thick, coarser-grained body represents the lateral extent and internal grain-size sorting of the body of the superimposed bedform. The plan view shape of the host lee slope controls the cross-stream geometry of cross strata. Thus, cross strata can be used to interpret type, size, and geometry of the host and superimposed bedforms, hence flow and sediment transport condition {{on the back of the}} host bedfor...|$|E

40|$|Copenhagen Municipality {{has with}} its plan ‘KBH 2025 Klimaplanen’ an overall target of {{becoming}} CO 2 neutral {{in the year}} of 2025. One of the means to reach this goal is to recycle all the rigid plastic in the combustible municipal household waste. This report views this change as a transition from the current incumbent regime to an alternative and more sustainable niche regime. We find that one of the required initiatives that make this plan possible is to establish a plastic sorting facility related to the waste stream in Copenhagen. The amount of rigid plastics generated within the municipality of Copenhagen is not enough to make the investment in a full-scale plastic sorting facility feasible. For the establishment of the facility to succeed, the municipality needs to cooperate with the neighbouring municipalities and combining their amount of rigid plastics waste and instead focus on a much smaller <b>pre-sorting</b> facility. We find that this can be done through their already established I/S Partnerships within the combined-heat-and-power plant Amagerforbrænding.
