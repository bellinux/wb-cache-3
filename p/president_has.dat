5|$|Articles 87 through 89 of the Constitution {{deal with}} how the {{presidency}} can change hands in-between election cycles. The <b>President</b> <b>has</b> the ability to resign from office at any time under Article 87. The letter of resignation {{is sent to the}} House of Representatives and is accepted by them. The <b>President</b> <b>has</b> the ability to be removed from office if his physical or mental health is impaired under Article 88. In order for this to happen, a two-thirds majority must be reached in the House of Representatives and the Council of the Republic on the resolution to remove the President. An ad hoc committee is formed and must make the determination about the state of health before any motion can begin. If the <b>President</b> <b>has</b> committed a grave crime, such as treason, one-third of the House must bring charges against the President formally. The investigation of the charges will be conducted by the Council of the Republic. In order to evict the President from office, a two-thirds majority is needed to vote in favor of conviction. The criminal case is further sent to the Supreme Court for review. The actions of either option must occur one month after the resolution is passed or the action will be considered void by the Constitution.|$|E

5|$|The {{suppression}} of the Whiskey Rebellion met with widespread popular approval.

The government's response to the rebellion was, therefore, viewed by the Washington administration as a success, a view that has generally been endorsed by historians. This also was one of only two times in U.S. history that an incumbent <b>president</b> <b>has</b> personally commanded the military in the field; James Madison would command an army in 1814.|$|E
