40|$|Purpose - This paper {{studies the}} effects of varying laser trim {{patterns}} on several performance parameters of thin film resistors such as the {{temperature coefficient of resistance}} (TCR) and target resistance value. Design/methodology/approach - The benefits and limitations of basic trim patterns are taken into consideration and the <b>plunge</b> <b>cut,</b> double <b>plunge</b> <b>cut</b> and the curved L-cut were selected to be modelled and tested experimentally. A computer simulation of the laser trim patterns has been developed for the modelling process of the resistors. The influence of the trim length and resistor dimensions on the TCR performance and resistance value of the resistors is investigated. Findings - It is found that variation in trim length, within the range of 5 to 15 mm, can give significant increases in the TCR of the thin films. Thus, for the plunge TCR cut can reach up to 11. 51 ppm/oC, for the double <b>plunge</b> <b>cut</b> up to 14. 34 ppm/oC and for the curved L-cut up to 5. 11 ppm/oC. Originality/value – Research on {{the effects of}} various laser trimming geometries on the TCR and target resistance accuracy is limited, especially for patterns such as the curved L-cut,which is investigated in this paper...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of different trim patterns {{on the performance of}} laser trimmed film resistors. A variety of popular trim pattern geometries including the plunge and L-cut were modelled and tested and their effect on resistance value, temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) and heat-affected-zone (HAZ) sensitivity was investigated. It is shown that variation in resistor dimensions and trim length in the trimming algorithm can increase the TCR of the resistors with results of 100 – 140 ppm/°C for the <b>plunge</b> <b>cut</b> and 100 – 130 ppm/°C for the L-cut. It is also found that the L-cut has lower sensitivity in the HAZ with a value of 11 % in comparison with the <b>plunge</b> <b>cut</b> with a value of 12 % for the same resistor dimensions...|$|E
50|$|Vertically-oriented CNC {{machines}} utilize cylindrical cutters on {{a vertical}} spindle axis to create <b>plunge</b> <b>cuts</b> and drilled holes, {{as well as}} custom shapes, slots, and details on three-dimensional parts. Equipment used {{in this type of}} milling includes vertical lathes, vertical machining centers, and 5-axis machines.|$|R
50|$|Chainsaw carving {{often makes}} {{deliberate}} use of <b>plunge</b> <b>cuts,</b> and cuts {{on the tip}} of the bar. By simply reducing the diameter of the chain nose, the amount of chain, and thus the force generated during a kickback, may be reduced. Specialist carving bars are available with small pointed noses.|$|R
50|$|In the {{vertical}} mill the spindle axis is vertically oriented. Milling cutters {{are held in}} the spindle and rotate on its axis. The spindle can generally be extended (or the table can be raised/lowered, giving the same effect), allowing <b>plunge</b> <b>cuts</b> and drilling. There are two subcategories of vertical mills: the bed mill and the turret mill.|$|R
40|$|A {{demonstration}} part will {{be manufactured}} in Japan {{on one of}} the large Toshiba machines with a diameter of 2. 5 meters. This will be a flat PMMA disk that is cut between 0. 5 and 1. 25 meters radius. The cut should demonstrate manufacturing the most difficult parts of the 2. 5 meter Fresnel pattern and the blazed grating on the diffractive surface. Optical simulations, validated with the subscale prototype, will be used to determine the limits on manufacturing errors (tolerances) that will result in optics that meet EUSO s requirements. There will be limits on surface roughness (or errors at high spatial frequency); radial and azimuthal slope errors (at lower spatial frequencies) and <b>plunge</b> <b>cut</b> depth errors in the blazed grating. The demonstration part will be measured to determine whether it was made within the allowable tolerances...|$|E
5000|$|The cutters {{most often}} used to cut spotfaces are {{counterbore}} cutters and endmills. In manual machining especially, the former is useful because its pilot guides the cutter into the correct location (established by the bolt hole), and its cutting lips are perpendicular to the hole axis with no relief angle, meaning that a <b>plunging</b> <b>cut,</b> moving in only the Z-axis, will leave a flat surface. In contrast, most general-purpose endmills have a relief angle such that a <b>plunging</b> <b>cut</b> (Z-axis-only toolpath) will leave a very slightly convex surface. But in CNC machining this is irrelevant, because the flat spotface is left by circular interpolation of the endmill as it traces a circular toolpath in the XY plane. Zero-angle cutters obviate this, functioning similarly to the traditional counterbore cutters of manual machining but needing no pilot. Spot facing of larger planar surfaces sometimes employs face mills.|$|R
50|$|A {{boring bar}} {{is a tool}} used in {{metalworking}} and woodworking. Boring is a technique used in many aspects of building. Woodworkers have used boring {{as a form of}} drilling for centuries. In woodworking, the boring tool is static in size and used to form circular <b>plunge</b> <b>cuts.</b> In metalworking, boring is slightly different in that the hole that results need not be circular. In metal boring the tool can be plunged and dragged on the X or Y axes to create a slot or asymmetrical hole or channel, or it may be moved only in an up-and-down motion (on the Z axis) to create a perfect circular hole.|$|R

40|$|AbstractSingle point diamond turning (SPDT) {{of large}} {{functional}} surfaces on silicon remains a challenge owing to severe diamond tool wear. Recently, tremendous {{efforts have been}} made in understanding the machining mechanics, especially wear mechanism of diamond tools in SPDT of silicon. However, the localised transition of machining mode from ductile to brittle as a result of progressive tool wear has not been well understood yet. In this paper both experimental and numerical simulation studies of SPDT were performed in an effort to reveal the underlying phenomenon of ductile to brittle transition (DBT) as a consequence of diamond tool wear. Series of facing and <b>plunging</b> <b>cuts</b> were performed and the profile of machined surface was evaluated together with the progression of tool wear. The transition stages from ductile to brittle were identified by analysing the surface profiles of <b>plunging</b> <b>cuts</b> using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a 2 D contact profilometer and a white light interferometer. The progressive degradation of the cutting edge of diamond tool and its wear mechanism was determined using Least Square (LS) arc analysis and SEM. The study reveals that at initial tool wear stage, the ductile to brittle transition initiates with the formation of lateral cracks which are transformed into brittle pitting damage with further tool edge degradation. Numerical simulation investigation using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) was also conducted in this paper in order to gain further insight of variation of stress on the cutting edge due to tool wear and its influence on brittle to ductile transition. A significant variation in frictional resistance to shear deformation as well as position shift of the maximum stress values was observed for the worn tools. The magnitude and distribution of hydrostatic stress were also found to change significantly along the cutting edge of new and worn diamond tools...|$|R
30|$|Open cat {{faces on}} bigcone Douglas-fir trees are an {{uncommon}} occurrence and, when present, are relatively poor recorders due to decay and burning out by subsequent fires. Trial and error sampling of full bark trees revealed that buried scars were very common on most trees within stands. At {{each of the}} stands we visited, an abundant tree-ring based fire history was evidently available for sampling (i.e., presence of bark charring and basal wounds) and no stands were passed over {{due to a lack}} of material. We subsequently targeted our sampling toward obviously older trees (as indicated by bole size, branch characteristics, etc.,) and those with characteristic furrows in the boles, which indicated healed over scars. Using a chainsaw, a skilled sawyer made <b>plunge</b> <b>cuts</b> to extract partial sections on upslope sides of living and standing dead trees as well as on downed snags. Typically, the partial wedge sections extracted were about 25 cm to 35 cm wide, 3 cm to 5 cm thick, and 50 cm to 70 cm long, extending to the tree center when feasible. Approximately 88 % of all full bark trees sampled had buried scars evident in the partial section. The average number of scars per sample was 3.2, while the maximum number of scars on one sample was 11.|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{offensive}} credentials of both teams, the game {{turned out to}} showcase the defenses of both teams. Stanford took the opening kickoff into East Carolina territory before the drive failed. On its next possession, Stanford appeared to be driving again, but Butterfield's pass was intercepted by Daren Hart, who raced 39 yards for a touchdown. Early in the second quarter, Pirate kicker Chad Holcomb kicked a 46-yard field goal. Stanford finally scored on an Adam Salina one-yard <b>plunge</b> to <b>cut</b> the lead to 10-7, but two Holcomb field goals in the last 2:01 of the half made the halftime score 16-7.|$|R
40|$|Nanometrically smooth {{infrared}} silicon optics can {{be manufactured}} by the diamond turning process. Due to its relatively low density, silicon {{is an ideal}} optical material for weight sensitive infrared (IR) applications. However, rapid diamond tool edge degradation and {{the effect on the}} achieved surface have prevented significant exploitation. With the aim of developing a process model to optimise the diamond turning of silicon optics, a series of experimental trials were devised using two ultra-precision diamond turning machines. Single crystal silicon specimens (1 1 1) were repeatedly machined using diamond tools of the same specification until the onset of surface brittle fracture. Two cutting fluids were tested. The cutting forces were monitored and the wear morphology of the tool edge was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The most significant result showed the performance of one particular tool was consistently superior when compared with other diamond tools of the same specification. This remarkable tool performance resulted in doubling the cutting distance exhibited by the other diamond tools. Another significant result was associated with coolant type. In all cases, tool life was prolonged by as much as 300 % by using a specific fluid type. Further testing {{led to the development of}} a novel method for assessing the progression of diamond tool wear. In this technique, the diamond tools gradual recession profile is measured by performing a series of <b>plunging</b> <b>cuts.</b> Tool shape changes used in conjunction with flank wear SEM measurements enable the calculation of the volumetric tool wear rate...|$|R
50|$|It is {{composed}} of Cretaceous metamorphic rocks (predominantly schists and gneisses) and quartzdioritic intrusives of Tertiary age. The Quaternary of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta is mainly represented by colluvial-alluvial valley fill and by recent beach deposits. The coastlines of the northwestern part of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta are indented, reflecting the alternation of rocky headlands and deep, NNW trending tectonically controlled bays. The headlands are typically 100 to 150 m high <b>plunging</b> cliffs <b>cut</b> into schists and granites, whereas the embayments front alluvial valley deposits. The bay shores are typically steep, reflective beaches composed of very coarse sand to granules eroded from adjacent cliffs and alluvial deposits. Wide pocket beaches and tombolos are common along sectors with abundant rocky erosional remnants and stacks.|$|R

40|$|Florida International University's (FIU) Hemispheric Center for Environmental Technology (HCET) {{evaluated}} five saws {{for their}} effectiveness in cutting specially prepared fiberglass-reinforced plywood crates. These crates were built as surrogates for crates that presently hold radioactively contaminated glove boxes at the Department of Energy's (DOE) Los Alamos facility. The Milwaukee worm drive circular saw was assessed on August 14, 2001. During the FIU test of efficacy, {{a team from}} the Operating Engineers National Hazmat Program (OENHP) evaluated {{the occupational safety and}} health issues associated with this technology. The Milwaukee worm drive circular saw is a hand-held tool with a 7 1 / 4 -inch diameter circular blade for cutting wood. The saw contains a fixed upper and a retractable lower blade guard to prevent access to the blade during use. The unit is operated with an on/off guarded trigger switch; and is supported with a handgrip mounted on top of the saw. An adjustable lever sets the depth of cut. The retractable blade guard permits blind or <b>plunge</b> <b>cuts</b> and protects from blade access during shutdown and blade coast. Kickback, the sudden reaction to a pinched blade, is possible when using this saw and could cause the saw to lift up and out of the work piece toward the operator. Proper work position and firm control of the saw minimizes the potential for a sprain or strain. Care needs to be exercised to support the work piece properly and to not force the tool. Personal noise sampling indicated that one worker was near the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Action Level of 85 decibels (dBA) while the other was at the Action Level with time-weighted averages (TWA's) of 82. 7 and 84. 6 dBA, respectively. These data are not entirely representative as they were gathered during a simulation and not at the actual worksite. Additional sampling should be conducted on-site, but the workers should wear hearing protection until it is determined that it is no longer necessary. Air sampling was performed while the workers dismantled the fiberglass-reinforced crates. The total nuisance dust sample for the Milwaukee circular saw was 36. 07 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m{sup 3 }), which is much higher than the OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) of 15 mg/m{sup 3 } and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists' (ACGIH) Threshold Limit Value (TLV) of 10 mg/m{sup 3 }. Galson Laboratories considered the fiber analysis void due to the overloading of the filter. The PEL for fiberglass is 1 fiber per cubic centimeter (f/cc) ...|$|R

25|$|With the Sri Lankan {{military}} on {{the verge}} of winning the war, the Tamil Tigers launched their first suicide air attack on the night of February 20, 2009. Two aircraft took off from a narrow road in Puthukkudiyirippu in the Mullaithivu District, and were sighted by Sri Lanka Army personnel operating along the front lines around 8:30 pm. The aircraft were soon detected by a Sri Lanka Air Force radar installation at Vavuniya. The aircraft, which had switched off their lights to avoid detection, proceeded towards Mannar and then southwards towards Colombo. Twenty minutes after the detection of the aircraft, an F-7 interceptor of the Sri Lanka Air Force was scrambled to intercept the planes, but was unable to do so due to the low altitude of the Tamil Tiger aircraft. The two Tamil Tiger aircraft then flew past the Bandaranaike International Airport, and three international flights were subsequently canceled. At 9:47 pm the aircraft entered airspace above Colombo, and air defense systems were activated. As a precaution, the power supply to the city of Colombo was <b>cut,</b> <b>plunging</b> the city into darkness.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{machining}} {{in manufacturing}} industry {{has become more}} competitive and demanding than ever before. Grinding {{as one of the}} last stages in the manufacturing process {{has been the focus of}} the research studies in the field of manufacturing for quite some time. Grinding process compared to the other machining operations involves in low rates of material removal. The thermal, metallurgical, and mechanical phenomena coupled with the grinding process, make the contact dynamics unpredictable and complicated; hence the grinding wheel life and cycle times cannot be determined from any available standard tables and charts. This is due to the fact that, a large number of parameters are influencing each other in a grinding process. During a grinding process there are undesirable experiences that can be included as thermal effects, chatter vibration, rapid grinding wheel wear, etc. In order to overcome these problems associated with the grinding process a correct understanding of the involving factors in the process is of great significance. This thesis work is focused on design and implementation of a bench scale plain type cylindrical grinding machine for grinding of the rolls in <b>plunge</b> and traverse <b>cut</b> in the laboratory environment. The servo controlled feed-drives and slide-way motions, which allow an efficient operation, are presented for each axis of the machine. Nonlinear friction effect as one of the major disturbances affecting the motion control systems is identified for the in-feed axis of the machine tool based on LuGre model. A novel method for grinding force estimation by monitoring of the thrust force in the infeed axis is presented based on the identified friction. The implementation of such an approach benefits the low cost compared to the common methods which use the dynamometer sensors for condition monitoring of the grinding process. A traverse grinding cut model is presented in succeeding chapter to show how this type of vibration can give rise to the grinding force value and make it unstable. The stability analysis for demonstration of the stability boundaries is presented, and the time domain cutting force in tangential and normal directions are presented numerically. Further investigations need to be conducted to validate the stability results...|$|R
