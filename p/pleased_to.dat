5|$|Force B {{commenced}} its attack {{after the}} Tallboy Lancasters had completed theirs {{so that the}} shock waves from bomb explosions did not prematurely set off the JW mines. As none of the Force B aircrew were able to spot Tirpitz due to the smokescreen, they dropped the mines on the battleship's estimated position. These weapons did not cause any damage. The smokescreen over Kaafjord prevented the Allied aircrew {{from being able to}} assess the results of their bombing, though several large spouts of water and explosions were observed. Tait was also <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> see a column of black smoke rising through the smokescreen. However, some of the bombs and mines landed up to a mile from the battleship.
