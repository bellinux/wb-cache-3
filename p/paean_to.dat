5|$|Twelve {{publishers}} {{rejected the}} manuscript before {{an editor at}} the Bobbs-Merrill Company risked his job to get it published. Contemporary reviewers' opinions were mixed. Some praised the novel as a powerful <b>paean</b> <b>to</b> individualism, while others thought it overlong and lacking sympathetic characters. Initial sales were slow, but the book gained a following by word of mouth and became a bestseller. More than 6.5million copies of The Fountainhead have been sold worldwide and it has been translated into more than 20 languages. The novel attracted a new following for Rand and has enjoyed a lasting influence, especially among architects and right-libertarians.|$|E
5|$|The song has a bright, {{expansive}} {{melody and}} has become famous in particular for its surrealistic imagery, influenced by artists as diverse as French poet Arthur Rimbaud and Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini. The lyrics call on the title character to play a song and the narrator will follow. Interpretations of the lyrics have included a <b>paean</b> <b>to</b> drugs such as LSD, {{a call to the}} singer's muse, a reflection of the audience's demands on the singer, and religious interpretations. Dylan's song has four verses, of which The Byrds only used the second for their recording. Dylan's and The Byrds' versions have appeared on various lists ranking the greatest songs of all time, including an appearance by both on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 best songs ever. Both versions also received Grammy Hall of Fame Awards.|$|E
25|$|Coupland then {{published}} his photographic <b>paean</b> <b>to</b> Vancouver, City of Glass. The book incorporates sections from Life After God and Polaroids from the Dead into a visual narrative, formed from photographs of Vancouver locations and life supplemented by stock footage mined from local newspaper archives.|$|E

25|$|The {{song was}} written about his {{observations}} of girls from and around The Avenue, Rose Bay (Sydney) though {{was seen as}} a <b>paean</b> <b>to</b> prostitutes by the record label, radio commentators and the prostitutes themselves. The song itself took a half an hour to write.|$|E
25|$|His {{body of work}} exerted {{a strong}} {{influence}} {{on some of the}} more adventurous British and American musicians and producers. The most notable are probably David Bowie and Brian Eno, who worked together on the late-70s 'Berlin Trilogy' of albums, Low, Heroes, and Lodger, all of which showed the strong influence of Plank's earlier German productions. Bowie's song 'Heroes' is a virtual <b>paean</b> <b>to</b> the Plank style, featuring radical sounds and dramatic alterations of sound in various elements, such as the lead vocal, to heighten the emotional or dramatic effect; this is placed against a swirling, droning electronic backing track that interweaves elements such as multitracked synthethisers and feedback guitar. In 1977, through Eno, Plank recruited Dave Hutchins from Island Studios, as house engineer. Hutchins undertook recording & mixing roles on many of the productions originating from the studios in the following ten years.|$|E

5|$|The Mangalkavyas were devotional <b>paeans</b> <b>to</b> local deities such as Manasa, {{composed}} in Bengal between the 13th and the 18th centuries. The Manasa Mangalkavya by Bijay Gupta and Manasa Vijaya (1495) by Bipradas Pipilai trace {{the origin and}} myths of the goddess.|$|R
5000|$|The Awls Noah Berlatsky {{describes}} VI: Flora as a [...] "long, sweeping, chthonic drone as Otrebor growls {{about his}} beloved plants ... he chokes and spits and whispers {{with all the}} reverent bile that black metal bands usually reserve for <b>paeans</b> <b>to</b> Satan." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1904 {{the critic}} Yuri Dyagilev (writing under the {{pseudonym}} Yu. Chereda), analyzed [...] "Anna on the Neck" [...] and [...] "The House with the Mezzanine" [...] {{along the lines}} of his own conception according to which Chekhov and Dostoyevsky were the masters of <b>paeans</b> <b>to</b> the 'philistine's happiness'.|$|R
500|$|In a less {{enthusiastic}} review, Scott Causer of Contactmusic.com stated, [...] "the song is a cheesy <b>paean</b> <b>to</b> their past. To {{their credit}} they don't pretend it's {{anything other than}} that." [...] MusicOMH's Nic Oliver called the collaboration [...] "wooden musically", but noted that Williams succeeds to [...] "turn in wry, self-deprecating lyric that bodes well for his mature years".|$|E
500|$|Dictators {{were not}} just glorified in fiction. Columbia's Mussolini Speaks (1933) was a 76-minute <b>paean</b> <b>to</b> the Fascist leader, narrated by NBC radio {{commentator}} Lowell Thomas. After showing some of the progress Italy has made during Il Duce's 10-year reign, Thomas opines, [...] "This {{is a time when}} a dictator comes in handy!" [...] The film was viewed by over 175,000 jubilant people during its first two weeks at the cavernous Palace Theater in Albany, New York.|$|E
500|$|... "Long, Long, Long" [...] {{is a song}} by the English {{rock band}} the Beatles from their 1968 album The Beatles (also known as [...] "the White Album"). It was written by George Harrison {{following}} the group's attendance at Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's Transcendental Meditation course in India in early 1968. Although Harrison later stated that he was addressing God in the lyrics, {{it is the first}} of his compositions that invites interpretation as both a standard love song and a <b>paean</b> <b>to</b> his deity.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} {{legend of}} Bernardo del Carpio was sung by the jongleurs of the Kingdom of León. Later, the Castilian poet Pero Ferrús (fl. 1380) mentions Bernardo del Carpio {{in one of}} his cantigas, which combines the theme of the good life in Castile with a series of loores, or lyric <b>paeans,</b> <b>to</b> a series of Greek, Roman, Biblical, chivalric, and Arab heroes.|$|R
5000|$|Writing in The Guardian, {{political}} journalist Gaby Hinsliff described Strange Death as [...] "Chapter after chapter {{circles around}} the same repetitive themes: migrants raping and murdering and terrorising; <b>paeans</b> <b>to</b> Christianity; long polemics about how Europe is too “exhausted by history” and colonial guilt to face another battle, and is thus letting itself be rolled over by invaders fiercely confident in their own beliefs." ...|$|R
40|$|We {{make much}} of 2 ̆ 2 Our Federalism. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 The Supreme Court {{routinely}} crafts doctrine to further its ends, and <b>paeans</b> <b>to</b> federalism regularly appear in law reviews. Federalism {{is a system that}} permits minorities to rule, and we are intimately familiar with its benefits: federalism promotes choice, competition, participation, experimentation, and the diffusion of power. The Court reels these arguments off as easily as do scholars...|$|R
500|$|According to Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe, [...] "Daughters" [...] is [...] "an emotionally complex <b>paean</b> <b>to</b> {{raising a}} girl" [...] by {{a father who}} [...] "struggles to let her find her way". Pitchfork Medias Jayson Greene said the song [...] "finds him {{examining}} the responsibilities of fatherhood with fond bewilderment." [...] New York Times critic Jon Caramanica remarked that Nas sounded conflicted [...] "between forgiving his daughter her occasional transgressions and indicting himself for not being a stern enough parent". In the opinion of Billboards Erika Ramirez, he drew on an allegory of fatherhood that seemed universal.|$|E
500|$|The {{first phase}} of {{development}} begins as a women's chorus of the younger angels invoke a [...] "happy company of blessed children" [...] who must bear Faust's soul heavenwards. The blessed boys receive the soul gladly; their voices are joined by Doctor Marianus (tenor), who accompanies their chorus before breaking into a rapturous E major <b>paean</b> <b>to</b> the Mater Gloriosa, [...] "Queen and ruler of the world!". As the aria ends, the male voices in the chorus echo the soloist's words to an orchestral background of viola tremolos, in a passage described by La Grange as [...] "emotionally irresistible".|$|E
500|$|The {{new owner}} of TSR, WotC's Peter Adkison, clearly did not harbor any of Lorraine Williams' ill-will toward Gygax: Adkison {{purchased}} all of Gygax's residual rights to D and AD for a six-figure sum. Although Gygax {{did not write}} any new supplements or books for TSR or WotC, he did agree to write the preface to the 1998 adventure Return to the Tomb of Horrors, a <b>paean</b> <b>to</b> Gygax's original AD adventure Tomb of Horrors. He also returned to the pages of Dragon Magazine, writing the [...] "Up on a Soapbox" [...] column from Issue #268 (January, 2000) to Issue #320 (June, 2004).|$|E
5000|$|There {{is also a}} long {{established}} and distinctive [...] "Mongolian pop" [...] genre that occupies the same place on the musical spectrum as Japanese Enka music or Western soft-pop-oriented folk music or country music. Classic singers from the late 20th and early 21st centuries include Vandan and Dulamsüren, Batsükh, Tömörkhuyag and Egshiglen. Some of the repeatedly heard lyrical themes are very distinctive for Mongolia: heartfelt tributes to the songwriter's mother, for example, or <b>paeans</b> <b>to</b> great horses.|$|R
5000|$|Cosmism {{was one of}} the {{influences}} on Proletkult, and after the October Revolution, the term came to be applied to [...] "the poetry of such writers as Mikhail Gerasimov and Vladimir Kirillov...: emotional <b>paeans</b> <b>to</b> physical labor, machines, and the collective of industrial workers ... organized around the image of the universal 'Proletarian,' who strides forth from the earth to conquer planets and stars." [...] This form of cosmism, along with the writings of Nikolai Fyodorov, was a strong influence on Andrei Platonov.|$|R
5000|$|The All About Jazz {{review by}} Clifford Allen notes that [...] "Smith's sense of {{orchestration}} {{has always seemed}} entirely different from Cherry's, whether in a solo or group context. The phrasing of both sound and silence, ever natural, has always appeared utterly poised, pinched and cutting front-porch <b>paeans</b> <b>to</b> downriver ancestry wrapped into a massive, fluffed whole. But {{it would be difficult}} to look at this set of duos without thinking of Mu, even when conscious of the contrast between the pairings." ...|$|R
500|$|Written in the CBS {{recording}} studio in Nashville over {{the space of}} eight hours {{on the night of}} February 15–16, [...] "Sad Eyed Lady" [...] eventually occupied the whole of side four of Blonde On Blonde. Critics have observed that [...] "Lowlands" [...] hints at [...] "Lownds", and Dylan biographer Robert Shelton wrote that this was a [...] "wedding song" [...] for Sara Lownds, whom Dylan had married just three months earlier. In his <b>paean</b> <b>to</b> his wife, [...] "Sara", written in 1975, Dylan amends history slightly to claim that he stayed [...] "up for days in the Chelsea Hotel/ Writin' 'Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands' for you".|$|E
500|$|The action {{takes place}} in two {{contrasting}} locations: the fields of Thrace (acts 1, 2 and 5) and the Underworld (acts 3 and 4). An instrumental toccata (English: [...] "tucket", meaning a flourish on trumpets) precedes the entrance of La musica, representing the [...] "spirit of music", who sings a prologue of five stanzas of verse. After a gracious welcome to the audience she announces that she can, through sweet sounds, [...] "calm every troubled heart." [...] She sings a further <b>paean</b> <b>to</b> the power of music, before introducing the drama's main protagonist, Orfeo, who [...] "held the wild beasts spellbound with his song".|$|E
500|$|The album fully {{established}} Jackson {{as a gay}} icon for its themes regarding {{homosexuality and}} protesting homophobia. [...] "Together Again", a [...] "post-Aids pop song", and [...] "Free Xone", considered [...] "a <b>paean</b> <b>to</b> homosexuality" [...] and an [...] "anti-homophobia track", were praised for their lyrical context, in addition to Jackson's lesbian reinterpretation of Rod Stewart's [...] "Tonight's the Night". The Velvet Rope received an award for [...] "Outstanding Music Album" [...] at the 9th Annual GLAAD Media Awards and was honored by the National Black Lesbian and Gay Leadership Forum. A portion of the proceeds from [...] "Together Again" [...] were donated to the American Foundation for AIDS Research.|$|E
5000|$|The {{song was}} {{described}} by Los Angeles Times music writer Mikael Wood as [...] "a total banger, with a killer electro-disco groove ... and a delightfully raunchy guest verse by Nicki Minaj." [...] Jon Blistein of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "'Back Together' boasts a bumping Studio 54 disco beat and buzzsaw synths reminiscent of the electro-pop surge led by Justice and Daft Punk. Thicke, however, sounds as soulful as ever, breezily crooning devoted <b>paeans</b> <b>to</b> a destructive love over Martin's catchy production." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 305. Dezir de Pero Ferruz a Pero López de Ayala (between 1379 and 1390; this cantiga {{combines}} {{the theme of}} the good life in Castile with a series of loores, or lyric <b>paeans,</b> <b>to</b> a series of Greek, Roman, Biblical, chivalric, and Arab heroes. These include Geryon, Cacus, Scipio Africanus, Joshua, King David, Arthur, Galahad, Roland, Amadis de Gaula, Saladin, Bernardo del Carpio, El Cid, and Ferdinand III of Castile. The list culminates with a mention of Henry II of Castile).|$|R
50|$|While {{the whole}} of McGuane’s fiction has only {{sporadic}} episodes of serenity and hopefulness - with Nothing But Blue Skies {{being one of the}} most hopeful novels -- Larry McMurtry has observed that McGuane’s nonfiction writing displays a markedly contrasting inner peace and natural spirituality. McGuane’s <b>paeans</b> <b>to</b> fly fishing (The Longest Silence), horses (Some Horses) and his life in the outdoors (An Outside Chance) capture his belief in the redeeming potential of nature and sporting ritual, and are widely considered among the finest writing in those genres.|$|R
500|$|... "Cool" [...] {{received}} acclaim {{from music}} critics. Yahoo! Music's Jennifer Nine {{referred to the}} song as [...] "a liltingly sweet <b>paean</b> <b>to</b> post-break-up friendships", while Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic called it a [...] "high school anthem-in-waiting" [...] theme; it also was selected {{as one of the}} album's highlights. Richard Smirke of Playlouder commented that the song successfully used the same production formula as fellow album tracks [...] "Serious" [...] and [...] "What You Waiting For?", and described it as a [...] "crisp blend of edgy 21C production and early 80s Madonna-esque pop". Jason Damas, in a review for PopMatters, characterized it as [...] "a slippery slice of keyboard" [...] New Wave song referring to it as a [...] "pitched halfway between The Go-Go's and Cyndi Lauper".|$|E
500|$|A 1997 {{review in}} Salon {{stated that the}} novel could almost be {{described}} as propaganda, and was terrifying as a result, particularly in its belief that the boot camp had to be an ingredient of any civilization. This {{was described as a}} highly unusual utopian vision. [...] Moorcock stated that the lessons Rico learns in boot camp: [...] "wars are inevitable, [...] that the army is always right". In discussing the book's utility in classroom discussions of the form of government, Alan Myers stated that its depiction of the military was of an [...] "unashamedly Earth-chauvinist nature". In the words of science fiction scholar Darko Suvin, Starship Troopers was an [...] "unsubtle but powerful black-and-white <b>paean</b> <b>to</b> combat life", and an example of agitprop in favor of military values.|$|E
500|$|Scar {{sings the}} musical number [...] "Be Prepared," [...] written by songwriters Elton John and Tim Rice, while contemplating Mufasa's death plot and {{bringing}} the hyenas along. Described as the film's [...] "darkest" [...] song, a [...] "pompous," [...] "fascistic <b>paean</b> <b>to</b> usurpers," [...] the musical sequence depicts the lion [...] "as a big-cat fascist." [...] According to Business Insider, {{in addition to}} loosely basing the character on Adolf Hitler to further emphasize Scar's tyranny, the filmmakers very much directly based his song [...] "Be Prepared," [...] which references Nazism by having Scar's army of hyenas goose step while addressing them from a high ledge – {{similar to the way}} in which Hitler would have from a balcony – on the Nazi propaganda film Triumph of the Will (1935), a film that documents Nazi Germany during 1934.|$|E
500|$|Sarah Rodman of Boston Globe {{depicted}} the song as a [...] "dance thumper" [...] and invites listeners to [...] "lose {{themselves in the}} music". Los Angeles Times Jeff Weiss viewed the song as [...] "generic" [...] with Usher [...] "singing generic <b>paeans</b> <b>to</b> a paramour’s eyes over a Eurovision-like Max Martin production." [...] Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine disapproved of the track as a whole, writing [...] "DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love is, while indistinguishable from any other overdriving club banger, {{one of the only}} songs in which Usher Raymond acknowledges an aphrodisiac more powerful than his own ab musk".|$|R
50|$|In the meanwhile, Togliatti as Minister of Justice decreed {{a general}} amnesty of fascist leaders and rank-and-file members amidst <b>paeans</b> <b>to</b> “the new man” and “the reborn democracy,” his party denounced the Internationalists as “fascists,” inciting a policy calling for their {{physical}} elimination. The culmination of this defamatory campaign was {{the assassination of}} two comrades, Mario Acquaviva and Fausto Atti, and others massacred by Stalinists but whose fate has remained shrouded in anonymity. Togliatti and the PCI, while advocating the freedom of real fascists, petitioned in the CLN to have {{the leaders of the}} Internationalist Communist Party condemned to death.|$|R
5000|$|Paul Lester of The Guardian {{described}} [...] "Ant Rap" [...] {{as one of}} [...] "the weirdest chart hits of all time:" [...] "Adam Ant {{is easily}} dismissed as pop pantomime, but his <b>paeans</b> <b>to</b> insects weren't just lyrically peculiar, they were examples of populist daring at its best, all yelps and Burundi beats - I'd single out his clattering Ant Rap as the weirdest of the weird, with extra points for reaching 3 with a song with no verse, no chorus, and a refrain comprising {{a list of the}} band members: 'Marco, Merrick, Terry-Lee, Gary Tibbs and yours tru-ly'." ...|$|R
