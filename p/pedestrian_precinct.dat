The article presents the survey and appreciation of the illumination solutions and artistic designs that were to create an effective light space of the Vladivostok coastal zones. Basing on the on-site investigations, conclusions have been drawn regarding the comfort, safety, and artistic expression of the light space of the named embankments as well as weather the illuminometer indications are in agreement with the accepted lightning standards...|$|R

Cities which adopted this strategy – the {{pedestrian zone}}s – have recorded better urban attitudes regarding the urban environment, a continuous growth of the urban quality, an improved urban ecosystem and continuous attractiveness for investment and tourism. This article explores the evolution of the pedestrian zones as ideas in utopian urban models in the early 1900 and later as efﬁcient environmental friendly strategies adopted by cities. After identifying the path this concept followed, from a simple idea to an important strategy of urban development, the paper focuses on the major characteristics and beneﬁts of the <b>pedestrian</b> <b>precincts.</b> Next, the article focuses on the newest pedestrian zone in one of the Romanian cities, Alba Iulia and it tries to identify the types of impact this area has so far on the community and entire city...|$|R

50|$|In the United States, bricks {{have been}} used for both {{buildings}} and pavements. Examples of brick use in buildings can be seen in colonial era buildings and other notable structures around the country. Bricks {{have been used}} in pavements especially during the late 19th century and early 20th century. The introduction of asphalt and concrete reduced the use of brick pavements, but it is used as a method of traffic calming or as a decorative surface in <b>pedestrian</b> <b>precincts.</b> For example, in the early 1900s, most of the streets in the city of Grand Rapids, Michigan, were paved with bricks. Today, there are only about 20 blocks of brick-paved streets remaining (totalling less than 0.5 percent of all the streets in the city limits). Much like in Grand Rapids, municipalities across the United States began replacing brick streets with inexpensive asphalt concrete by the mid-20th century.|$|R

40|$|For some time, the SWOV Institute for Road Safety Research has had at its {{disposal}} key risk indexes {{that describe}} the safety level on various road types. Since 1996, these figures have been determined by means of KenPro, a calculation program that contains a sample of main roads located {{both inside and outside}} urban areas. Since the greatest percentage of accidents involving road casualties occurs on the more important roads, it was decided to focus primarily on these. Data about `lower-order roads' (residential roads, roads in <b>pedestrian</b> <b>precincts</b> and rural roads) is not represented in the key risk indexes. The same applies to data about slow traffic, limited in this study to bicycle traffic. The study lists the costs and benefits involved in order to arrive at a well-considered choice {{as to whether or not}} to determine key risk indexes for the underlying road network and slow traffic. Adding the data associated with slow traffic to KenPro's total sample would cost approximately 200, 000 to 250, 000 Dutch guilders. For gathering the necessary sample of lower-order roads, an amount of approximately 200, 000 Dutch guilders is estimated. For the second part see C 11054 (IRRD 491569) ...|$|R
50|$|Pedestrian zones (also {{known as}} auto-free zones and car-free zones, and as <b>pedestrian</b> <b>precincts</b> in British English) are areas {{of a city}} or town {{reserved}} for pedestrian-only use and in which most or all automobile traffic may be prohibited. Converting a street or an area to pedestrian-only use is called pedestrianisation. Pedestrianisation usually aims to provide better accessibility and mobility for pedestrians, to enhance the volume of shopping and other business activity in the area and/or to improve the attractiveness of the local environment in terms of aesthetics, air pollution, noise and accidents involving pedestrians. However, pedestrianisation can sometimes lead to reductions in business activity, property devaluation, and displacement of economic activity to other areas. In some cases traffic in surrounding areas may increase, due to displacement rather than substitution of car traffic. Nonetheless, pedestrianisation schemes are often associated with significant drops in local air and noise pollution, accidents, and frequently with increased retail turnover and increased property values locally. A car-free development generally implies a large scale pedestrianised area that relies on modes of transport other than the car, while pedestrian zones may vary in size from a single square to entire districts, but with highly variable degrees of dependence on cars for their broader transport links.|$|R

40|$|Electric-motored {{personal}} mobility devices (PMDs) are appearing on Australian roads. While legal to import and own, their use is typically illegal for adult riders within the road transport system. However, these devices could provide {{an answer to}} traffic congestion by getting people out of cars for short trips ("first-and-last mile" travel). City of Ryde council, Macquarie University, and Transport for NSW examined PMD use within the road transport system. Stage 1 of the project examined PMD use within a controlled pedestrian environment on the Macquarie University campus. Three PMD categories were used: one-wheelers (an electric unicycle, the Solowheel); two-wheelers (an electric scooter, the Egret); and three-wheelers (the Qugo). The two-wheeled PMD was most effective in terms of flexibility. In contrast, the three-wheeled PMD was most effective in terms of speed. One-wheeled PMD riders were very satisfied with their device, especially at speed, but significant training and practice was required. Two-wheeled PMD riders had less difficulty navigating through <b>pedestrian</b> <b>precincts</b> and favoured the manoeuvrability of the device as the relative narrowness of the two-wheeled PMD {{made it easier to}} use on a diversity of path widths. The usability of all PMDs was compromised by the weight of the devices, difficulties in ascending steeper gradients, portability, and parking. This was a limited trial, with a small number of participants and within a unique environment. However, agreement has been reached for a Stage 2 extension into the Macquarie Park business precinct for further real-world trials within a fully functional road transport system. 13 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This article {{deals with}} the impact of certain retail {{strategies}} on urban life. More specifically it deals with two recent tendencies of the retail environment: (a) spatial homogenisation and clustering of retail into large areas or territories, and (b) the synchronisations of retail with different kinds of public activities and events. For the last decades, retail areas have tended to grow larger and more legible, whereas a lot of stores in residential areas have been forced to close. The stores of the city centre tend to concentrate to certain streets or <b>pedestrian</b> <b>precincts.</b> However, in addition to this we have the seemingly contradictive tendency of retail deterritorialization and spreading, in order to make use of public places, such as railways stations, bus stations, museums, libraries, etc. In this article, I use Malmö as an example. Malmö has been quite successful (in a Swedish context) during the last decade, with an increasing number of customers and stores. Here, we do not just have the territorialization and consolidation of (for example) the centre as a shopping district, but also retailers that try to organize and in different ways synchronize commercial rhythms with important urban rhythms and mobilities of everyday life. These two trends of territorialization and synchronisation both feed and counteract each other in different ways. The article makes use of Lefebvre’s rhythmanalysis as well as a territorial analysis (Kärrholm, 2004, 2005) in an effort of first identifying and defining these current trends of the retail environment (in Malmö). I then go on to focus mainly on the neglected but influential aspect of synchronization in order to discuss some {{of the ways in which}} affect territorial production and public life, i. e. supporting certain urban rhythms, uses and identities while undermining others...|$|R
