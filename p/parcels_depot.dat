5|$|Plans for {{the club}} {{to move to a}} new groundMaine Roadin Moss Side were {{announced}} in 1922. The final Manchester City match at Hyde Road was a league fixture against Newcastle United on 28 April 1923, and in August 1923 a public practice game was the last football match played at Hyde Road. Manchester City began the 192324 season at Maine Road, which had an 80,000 capacity. Parts of Hyde Road were used elsewhere; the roof of the Main Stand was sold to Halifax Town, and erected at The Shay, where even in the 21st century, part of the Hyde Road roof is still in place. Within a decade, all traces of the football ground had disappeared from Hyde Road. The bulk of the area was taken over by Manchester Corporation Tramways department, whose major Hyde Road depot and works was alongside, for use as their Permanent Way yard for assembling and storing tramway rails and materials. The Tramways system also provided at this time a substantial parcels handling service within the city, using both vans and special parcels trams, and a new central <b>parcels</b> <b>depot</b> was built on the Bennett Street side of the former site, against the railway viaduct. After the end of Manchester's trams in 1949 (most of the old trams were scrapped on this site) it was used for storing old buses and as a bus drivers' training area. As of 2000, the site of the pitch is Olympic Freight Terminal, a container storage and warehousing facility.|$|E

There was speculation that air filter changing undertaken by the two men affected, shortly after the Chernobyl accident in 1986, may have exposed them to concentrated radioactive fallout. A radiation survey of the <b>parcel</b> <b>depot</b> was undertaken and revealed no evidence of abnormal radioactivity. A total of 27 past and present engineering staff were screened for thyroid cancer. No cases of thyroid cancer were found. Investigation of clusters of rare disease In the occupational setting Is Indicated mainly in order to address the concerns of the workforce.

500|$|The {{first phase}} of {{construction}} involved building 18 new platforms with two track bays to handle parcels above this, along with a signal and communications building and various staff offices. The parcel deck was reinforced by 5,500 tons of structural steelwork. The signalling on the main routes leading {{out of the station}} was completely reworked along with the electrification of the lines, including the British Rail Automatic Warning System. Fifteen platforms had been complete by 1966, and the full electric service began on 3 January. A fully automated <b>parcel</b> <b>depot,</b> sited above platforms 3 to 18, opened on 7 August 1966.

50|$|The {{original}} {{station was}} built in 1838 {{as part of the}} London and Birmingham Railway and could be entered from Warwick Road, where two flights of stairs took the passengers down to the platform. Within two years it had been replaced, with a new larger station, a few hundred feet nearer to Rugby, this time, accessed via Eaton road. In the late 19th century the Coventry tram network extended to the station at Eaton Road. The original station remained in service as the station masters offices, until the station was redeveloped in the early 1960s by the London Midland Region of British Railways.The new 1840 station saw a significant number of modifications and extensions over the years, there was an engine shed, water column and turntable, in its later days an inclined walkway from the platform directly to Warwick Road for summer excursions, and a <b>parcel</b> <b>depot</b> formed from old carriages. However, the station was constrained by bridges {{at either end of the}} station, Stoney Road Bridge to the south, and Warwick Road bridge to the north. The bridges effectively restricted the station to two lines, and prevented the platforms from being extended.|$|R
50|$|The A15 moves southward {{as a minor}} dual {{carriageway}} from its junction with the A47 with several more roundabouts lining its route.

40|$|There is {{a looming}} public {{interest}} in the land administration dimension of local transportation infrastructure redevelopment. Such interest is conditioned by the belief that franchised public bus companies were able to obtain government leasehold land parcels on favourable terms. By scrutinizing the land title documents using professional valuation techniques and available internal government documents, this paper provides further and better information for evaluating {{the proposition that the}} land <b>parcels</b> for <b>depots</b> were obtained on favourable terms from the government. This interdisciplinary paper identifies the actual sources and methods the franchised China Motor Bus and Kowloon Motor Bus obtained depots from the land market to develop and change their use. It also investigates if there is any evidence of government concessions in terms of land values and development permissions. The findings refute the conspiracy thesis that there are such concessions. The case of the franchised public bus companies in Hong Kong should be of wider academic interest not only because, unlike counterparts {{in many parts of the}} world, they have been making profits without direct government subsidies. This does not only shed light on whether or not there was any implicit assistance informed by the corollary of the Coase Theorem, but also the conditions for public bus and other public transport modes are able to provide viable alternatives to private transport...|$|R

40|$|AbstractUrban goods {{distribution}} {{is important for}} the economy. However urban transport causes traffic, noise and pollution. The European Research project CityLog (part of Framework Programme 7) aims at increasing efficiency in urban distribution by proposing a logistics model based on two types of vehicles and containers solution in the context of parcel delivery. The urban delivery scheme currently consists of a number of vehicles that leave the hub and drive towards the city. The innovative logistics model for urban deliveries introduces a concept which make use of two types of vehicles: a Freight bus which is loaded at the depot with several load units that can carry generic parcels, and a Delivery van which is a light vehicle with high eco-compatible characteristics that make it very suitable {{to be used in the}} inner city Each load unit, when transferred from the Freight bus to the Delivery van, replaces the body of the van. These interoperable vehicles and containers form an improved logistics chain, reducing the number of vehicles entering the city, chilometers driven and pollutant emissions. Another source of unnecessary driven chilometers is unsuccessful deliveries when the receiver is not home during the delivery. The Modular BentoBox is the second concept introduced by the project. It allows to obtain a balance between optimisation of logistics and customer's interests by delivering goods to the bentobox, instead that to the customer location. There parcels are stored in the bentobox until the customer picks them up. The Modular BentoBox System introduces the concept of removable modules that is trolleys with various size drawers. These trolleys and their drawers are filled in with <b>parcels</b> at the <b>depot.</b> The carrier transports the trolleys downtown and inserts them into the bentobox. As soon as the customer is notified, the parcel is ready at the bentobox. To access the parcel, the customer enters his special code on a user interface. The Modular BentoBox System can also be provided with a weighting and payment system and used for shipping parcels. The trolleys with shipments are taken back to the depot by the carrier. These CityLog concepts will be implemented and tested in 2012 in three European cities: Berlin, Lyon and Turin...|$|R
