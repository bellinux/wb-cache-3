40|$|This report {{describes}} the design, development, {{and testing of}} a system capable of locating and striking vertically launched ping pong balls. The system relies on a pan-tilt mechanism with the <b>pan</b> <b>axis</b> being utilized for striking the ball with a specific velocity and the tilt axis used to control the angle at which the ball is struck. A variety of challenges are posed to the system, many of them stemming from the inherent difficulties in assembling a system reliant on the solutions to many smaller problems...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} ArmillEye, a 3 -degree {{of freedom}} (DOF) flexible hybrid platform designed for agile underwater stereoptic vision. Effective telecontrol systems of remote operated vehicles require active and dexterous camera support {{in order to}} allow the operator to easily and promptly change the point of view, also improving the virtual reconstruction of the environment in difficult operative conditions (dirtiness, turbulence, and partial occlusion). The same concepts hold for visual servoing of autonomous underwater vehicles. ArmillEye was designed for this specific application; {{it is based on the}} concept of using a parallel-hybrid mechanism architecture that, in principle, allows us to minimize the ad hoc waterproof boxes (generally only for cameras) while the actuators, fixed to the base of the mechanism, can be placed into the main body of the underwater vehicle. This concept was revealed effective and was previously proposed for underwater arms. The synthesis of ArmillEye followed the specific aims of visual telecontrol and servoing, specifying vision workspace, dexterity, and dynamics parameters. Two versions of ArmillEye are proposed: the first one with two cameras to obtain a steroptic vision by using two viewpoints (two rotational freedoms with a fixed tilt or <b>pan</b> <b>axis</b> and vergence); the second one with one camera operated to obtain a stereoptic vision by using one viewpoint (two rotational freedoms with a fixed tilt or <b>pan</b> <b>axis</b> and extrusion) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} active vision systems {{requires}} {{the integration of}} action and perception components and therefore involves a range of disciplines, including computer vision, control theory, and mechatronics. Assessments {{of the performance of}} the resulting system are needed at all stages of the development. ^ This dissertation addresses the problem of finding both measures and means for evaluating the performance of an active vision system in a systematic and quantitative way. In particular, we examine the performance of a camera <b>pan</b> <b>axis</b> in a monocular fixation task. ^ The work combines model-based analysis with experiments on a real active vision system. We start by constructing models for all components of the system and match the models with the actual hardware through calibration or system identification. ^ For the performance evaluation experiments we built a testbed consisting of two robot manipulators that generate controllable and repeatable target motions. Several factors have been identified that influence the geometry and accuracy of the target motion and its mapping onto the image plane. ^ The first set of experiments tests the linear properties of the active vision system. The experiments measure the frequency response of the system, which is used to identify a linear model of the active vision system. ^ The main problem of linear characterizations of performance is that they cannot model the loss of the target. The second set of experiments explores some of the conditions under which the linear model fails and the system loses the target from its field of view. The knowledge of these performance limits can be used to increase the range of operation of the active vision system by adapting the operating parameters dynamically to the motion characteristics of the target. ...|$|E
50|$|Modest image {{stabilization}} systems can degrade image quality if the photographer is intentionally panning (as the system tries to negate the panning motion), {{or if the}} camera is mounted on a very sturdy tripod (the system drifts around slowly due to spurious measurements {{over the course of}} a long exposure). Some more recent IS systems can automatically detect these situations and disable the IS along the <b>panning</b> <b>axis,</b> or disable it completely if the camera is on a tripod. Sweep panoramic photography certainly use panning system. So, modern {{image stabilization}} system is not use 2 axis anymore, but up to 5 axis: horizontal axis, vertical axis and rotation of 3 axis.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} visually servoing a legged vehicle with unicycle-like nonholonomic constraints subject to second-order fore-aft dynamics in its horizontal-plane. We target applications to rugged environments char-acterized by complex terrain likely to perturb significantly the robot’s nominal dynamics. At the same time, {{it is crucial that}} the camera avoid “obstacle ” poses where absolute localization would be compromised by even partial loss of landmark visibility. Hence, we seek a controller whose robustness against disturbances and obstacle avoidance capabilities can be assured by a strict global Lyapunov function. Since the nonholonomic constraints preclude smooth point stabilizability we introduce an extra degree of sensory freedom, affixing the camera to an actuated <b>panning</b> <b>axis</b> mounted on the robot’s back. Smooth stabilizability to the robot-orientation-indifferent goal cycle no longer precluded, we construct a controller and strict global Lyapunov function with the desired properties. We implement several versions of the scheme on a RHex robot maneuvering over slippery ground and document its successful empirical performance. I...|$|R
50|$|A panning {{time-lapse}} can {{be easily}} and inexpensively achieved by using a widely available Equatorial telescope mount with a Right ascension motor (*360 degree example using this method). Two <b>axis</b> <b>pans</b> can be achieved as well, with contemporary motorized telescope mounts.|$|R
50|$|Image {{stabilizer}} mode switch: This switch {{is found}} on many EF lenses that feature an image stabilizer, {{particularly those of}} longer focal lengths. The switch has two settings on most lenses: Mode 1 and Mode 2. The newest IS Mark II versions of certain EF super telephoto lenses (the 300mm f/2.8L, 400mm f/2.8L, 500mm f/4L, and 600mm f/4L), plus the 200-400mm f/4L IS and 100-400mm f/4-5.6L IS II, have a third setting, Mode 3. Mode 1 is normal mode, used for typical photography, where the subject does not move. Mode 2 is used for panning; this is useful for sports or wildlife photography, where the subject moves constantly and one will need to pan. Mode 3, intended to track action, is similar to Mode 2 in that it ignores panning; however, it only applies stabilization when the shutter is released—the viewfinder image is not stabilized. One should not use Mode 1 for panning as this will typically cause blurred photographs; the image stabilizer will attempt to correct for all motion, including the panning motion, but cannot do so due to the limited range of motion of the IS mechanism. Older lenses that have an image stabilizer, but do not feature this switch, are permanently in Mode 1. Some newer lenses, such as the Canon EF-S 18-200mm lens, are able to detect if they are being <b>panned</b> in either <b>axis</b> and will automatically disable the stabilization for the axis parallel to movement and therefore do not require this switch.|$|R
50|$|Stabilization qualities {{enhanced}} by placement of Kenyon gyros onto mount Helicopter mounts {{are based on}} the principle of a balanced beam that has its gimbal point (center of gravity) behind the operator’s head. The gimbal point is the exact balance point of the roll, pitch and yaw. At the front of the balanced beam is the camera and camera control. At the back of the beam are the counterweights and batteries. The camera has an additional <b>pan</b> and tilt <b>axis</b> (yaw and pitch axis). These are balanced in their own right about the sub camera tilt axis of the balanced beam. This balanced beam in itself has a certain amount of inertia and will resist minimal angular disturbances coming up the gimbal mounting frame. However, in order to achieve a further degree of stabilization, Kenyon gyro modules are added. The Kenyon gyro module is an off-the-shelf motorized flywheel in a cage with one degree of freedom. When the spinning masses (flywheels) within the Kenyon gyro housing, are activated, they add an increased inertia (synthetic) to the overall system, which improves the mount’s ability to absorb the base angular disturbances from reaching the camera. These helicopter mounts with or without Kenyon gyros, can work quite well if: the weather conditions are perfect; the helicopter has the minimum of low frequency vibration (blades have been ‘tracked’ correctly); and you have a “qualified movie pilot” in control of the ship. An operator can achieve good stability for medium focal length lenses with short duration shots at the longer end of the lens. The drawbacks of (C) systems are that the operator’s physical strength is needed to position the camera while they are hanging out the side door of the helicopter. It is hard for the operator to maneuver the camera’s line of site when they are following a subject. The Kenyon gyros will resist their camera positioning, as the gyro will consider it part of the angular base motion. Because of this interaction, the helicopter pilot must undertake most of the camera positioning; the operator will just point the camera at the subject, relying on the pilot for keeping the subject in frame.|$|R
