25|$|Montreal and Toronto {{were well}} suited {{to benefit from the}} {{development}} of large-scale manufacturing and extensive railway systems in Quebec and Ontario, these being the goals of the Macdonald and Laurier governments. In the Maritimes the situation was very different. Today New Brunswick has several mid-sized centres in Saint John, Moncton, and Fredericton but no significant population centre. Nova Scotia has a growing metropolitan area surrounding Halifax, but a contracting population in industrial Cape Breton, and several smaller centres in Bridgewater, Kentville, Yarmouth, and Pictou County. Prince Edward Island's only significant population centres are in Charlottetown and Summerside. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, just the opposite was the case with little to no <b>population</b> <b>concentration</b> in major industrial centres as the predominantly rural resource-dependent Maritime economy continued on the same path as it had since European settlement on the region's shores.|$|E

Rødkleiva was regarded as more favorable because of the ease of transport, high <b>population</b> <b>concentration,</b> and that an all-new hill would allow for better television pictures. The federation's goal was for Norway to regain its status as the prime organizer of ski jumping competitions. President of the Norwegian Ski Federation Sverre Seeberg stated that they had offered the International Ski Federation (FIS) to use Vikersundbakken every year, but that FIS had prioritized Granåsen for the World Cup. Seeberg stated that Norway would therefore focus on making Granåsen the regular venue for the World Cup opening.|$|E
