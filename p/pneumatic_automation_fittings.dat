40|$|Abstract — Industrial Automation {{is a broad}} field {{among other}} {{engineering}} disciplines. The major activities of Automation stem from manufacturing industries and include cycle time improvement, productivity improvement, cost reduction, efficiency improvement, materials handling, analyze and improve the work methods, to eliminate waste and proper allocation and utilization of resources. Automation in a manufacturing shop {{is one of the}} most challenging tasks, as it has an impact of many interrelated variables and parameters. A detailed study by large data acquisition and analysis is essential for understanding the trends in productivity improvement. Productivity improvement is achieved through analyzing the current method by eliminating unnecessary movements, reducing cycle time and providing appropriate solutions to various problems during the machining of components to improve productivity. The project titled “Productivity Improvement on a CNC Lathe by Automatic Loading and Unloading of Throttle Valve Component ” includes analysis and detailed study of manufacturing process including loading and unloading methods of components on a machine. This project involves the use of <b>automation</b> techniques namely <b>pneumatics</b> <b>automation</b> to increase the productivity and efficiency.

40|$|Compressibility of air used as {{a working}} medium in {{pneumatic}} control systems raise certain difficulties in calculating dynamic characteristics of the pneumatic drive and solving problems of its regulation. These difficulties are due {{to a number of}} factors:    - flow of compressed air through the narrow working splits of distributive and throttling devices of pneumatic control;    - filling in and discharging the pneumatic actuator cavities of variable volume (piston and rod cavities of the air-cylinder) under conditions of heat and mass transfer;    - simultaneous filling in and discharging a pneumatic cavity of permanent volume (receiver);    - pneumatic cylinder piston end positioning alteration under variable loading and at the moment of shutdown; A number of factors {{have a significant impact on}} the piston end positioning alteration value, namely an initial positioning of the piston at the moment of its shutdown, which determines the volume of the pneumatic cylinder cavity; a value of the permanent component of the load at the moment the piston shuts down and its change during keeping time period; transmission coefficient of the positioning component of the load; a working area of the air-cylinder piston and also an atmospheric pressure reduction, which can significantly affect the operation of control systems of a small aircraft at high altitudes. With a view to deepening the problem of calculation and design of pneumatic actuators, it is shown that the relationship between the parameters of compressed air and their changes is determined by the properties of thermodynamic processes under conditions of heat and mass transfer. In pneumatic actuators for general industrial use, the pressure of compressed air does not exceed a value equal to 1 MPa. In this case, the working medium can be regarded as an ideal gas in simplified calculations. Based on the general equation of thermodynamics, the paper considers the particular cases of a changing gas state process under its constant temperature, pressure, and volume and also in the absolute or partial absence of heat exchange with the surrounding medium. The inconstancy of the compressed air mass during filling in and discharging of pneumatic cavities of variable volume causes non-stationary thermodynamic processes in the pneumatic actuators and requires their specifying in conditions of heat and mass exchange. The pneumatic actuator piston speed is related to the peculiarities of the working medium movement through the narrow slits of distribution and control devices of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>automation</b> due to dependency of the flow on the outflow parameter, which in turn is related to the criticality of the outflow process (the ratio of the pressure at the outlet of the throttling device and at its inlet). It is shown that when calculating and designing the pneumatic drives, including closed-loop ones, as well as for evaluating their dynamic characteristics, a system solution of the equations determining the processes of filling and discharging the cavities of the pneumatic cylinder is required, taking into account the peculiarities of compressed air movement through the narrow slits of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>automation</b> devices. The outflow parameter available in the equations of the pneumatic drive dynamics and determined by the outflow process criticality and by the heat exchange conditions (a poly-tropic index) requires their numerical solution. </p...|$|R

The aim here is to minimize the production cycle time, and to improve the economic performance and system productivity. The system designed can be partitioned into five major parts: vision module, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>automation</b> module, manipulator, conveyor-belt and a software that manages and integrates these modules. The developed software captures raw image data from a camera that is connected to a PC via usb port. Using image processing methods, this software determines the proper coordinates and pose of the moving parts on the conveyor belt in real time. The pick and place system locates the parts to the packaging area as part. s predefined orientation. The software communicates with a controller card via serial port, manages and synchronizes the peripherals (conveyor belt stepper motors- pneumatic valves,etc) of the system. C programming language {{is used in the}} implementation. OpenCV library is utilized for image acquisition. The system has the following characteristics: The Conveyor belt runs with a constant speed and objects on the conveyor belt may have arbitrary position and orientation. The vision system detects parts with their position and orientation on the moving conveyor belt based on a reference position. The manipulator picks the part and then corrects its position comparing the information obtained by vision system with predefined position, and it places the object to the packaging area.

40|$|The turbulent-flow {{throttles}} {{are used}} in pneumatic systems and gas-supply ones to restrict or measure gas mass flow. It is customary to install the throttles in joints of pipelines (in teejoints and cross tees) or in joints of pipelines with <b>pneumatic</b> <b>automation</b> devices Presently, in designing the pneumatic systems and gas-supply ones a gas mass flow through a throttle is calculated by a known equation derived from the Saint-Venant-Vantсel formula for the adiabatic flow of ideal gas through a nozzle from an unrestrictedly high capacity tank. Neglect of gas velocity at the throttle inlet {{is one of the}} assumptions taken {{in the development of the}} above equation. As may be seen in practice, in actual systems the diameters of the throttle and the pipe wherein it is mounted can be commensurable. Neglect of the inlet velocity therewith can result in an error when determining the required throttle diameter in design calculation and a flow rate in checking calculation, as well as when measuring a flow rate in the course of the test. The theoretical study has revealed that the flow velocity at the throttle inlet is responsible for two parameter values: the outlet flow velocity and the critical pressure ratio, which in turn determine the gas mass flow value. To calculate the gas mass flow, the dependencies are given in the paper, which allow taking into account the flow rate at the throttle inlet. The analysis of obtained dependencies has revealed that the degree of influence of inlet flow rate upon the mass flow is defined by two parameters: pressure ratio at the throttle and open area ratio of the throttle and the pipe wherein it is mounted. An analytical investigation has been pursued to evaluate the extent to which the gas mass flow through the throttle is affected by the inlet flow rate. The findings of the investigation and the indications for using the present dependencies are given in this paper. By and large the investigation allowed the conclusion that the inlet flow rate must be taken into account when calculating the gas mass flow through the throttles of pneumatic systems and gas supply systems...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that if dynamic electricity pricing tariffs {{were to be}} introduced, their effectiveness in controlling domestic loads will be curtailed if consumers were relied on to respond in their own interests. The complexities of relating behavior to load to price are so burdensome {{that at least some}} degree of automation would be required to take advantage of pricing signals. However, a major issue with home <b>automation</b> is <b>fitting</b> in with the lifestyles of individual consumers. Truly smart appliances that can learn the details of their routine operation may be several years away from widespread adoption making integrated home energy management systems unfeasible. Similarly, usage patterns of these same appliances may be substantially different from household to household. The contribution of this paper is the proposal and demonstration of a set of probabilistic models that act in a framework to reduce appliance usage data into contextual knowledge that accounts for variability in patterns in usage. Using sub-metered load data from various domestic wet appliances, the proposed technique is demonstrated learning the appliance operating likelihood surfaces from no prior knowledge...|$|R

40|$|Guillermo Baquero (Quito, 1967) is {{assistant}} professor of Finance and Investments at the Rotterdam School of Management of Erasmus University Rotterdam since 2005. He holds a degree in mechanical engineering (Quito, 1992) and has a professional experience of several years {{in the field of}} hydraulic and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>automation.</b> Later he obtained an MBA from the Université Catholique de Louvain and an MSc in Economics from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, in Belgium. Between 1999 and 2001 he worked as a research associate at the Centre for Economic Studies (CES) of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. In September 2001 he joined the Financial Management Department of the Rotterdam School of Management and the ERIM PhD program. Guillermo’s research has focused on the persistence of hedge funds and mutual funds, the behaviour of hedge fund investors, behavioural finance and experimental economics. The article at the basis of Chapter 3 of this book was awarded the prize for the best paper on hedge funds at the European Finance Association meetings in Zurich in 2006. The article at the basis of Chapter 2 was published in the Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis in 2005 and was awarded the prize for the second best paper on hedge funds at the European Finance Association meetings in Glasgow in 2003. Guillermo’s teaching experience includes a number of courses in Corporate Finance, Investments and Behavioural Finance, both at the bachelor and master level, and courses in Industrial Engineering at the executive level. He has worked as a consultant for several firms and organizations in Belgium and Ecuador in matters related to Finance and Development. He is also a guest lecturer at the Latin-American Faculty of Social Sciences (FLACSO) in Quito, Ecuador. In {{a relatively short period of}} time, hedge funds have become major players in the financial markets. In 2004, the estimated total reached nearly 8000 funds, and the assets under management had risen to $ 1 trillion, from nearly $ 100 billion in 1994. The client base for hedge funds has expanded beyond foundations and endowments to company pensions, public pensions, and to less “sophisticated” investors. However, the increasing and widespread acceptance of hedge funds as an alternative investment vehicle is disconcerting if we consider their limited transparency and the restricted liquidity conditions imposed to investors. On these grounds, serious questions arise about investors’ ability to make the right investment choices in hedge funds. This book speaks to these concerns. The four essays presented here examine the investment process of investors, the underlying factors determining their choices and the implications for investors’ wealth and for hedge funds’ performance. Four main conclusions follow. First, that hedge fund managers exhibit, on average, persistence in their performance at quarterly horizons, justifying to some extent an active search for skilled managers; however, large informational asymmetries prevent investors from taking timely decisions and exploiting the persistence of good performing funds while incurring high opportunity costs. In contrast, investors are able to divest swiftly from the poor performers, which may have a moderating effect on the risk-taking incentives of managers. Finally, investors appear to misread the information available and overreact to persistence patterns, both at the individual fund level and at the style level. Overall, this study confirms a potentially suboptimal allocation of capital flows across hedge funds, calling for higher levels of transparency in the demand side for capital, and more cautious due diligence and increased prudence in the supply side...|$|R
40|$|Manufacturing {{flexibility}} can {{be generally}} defined as system ability to counter {{external and internal}} changes rapidly and cost-effectively. This concept {{has become a major}} issue for survival and development of firms operating in mechanical manufacturing line of business, and {{also one of the most}} effective leverages to attain the desired system performances both in terms of product quantities, costs and quality. This paper deals with the practical assessment of flexibility indexes in real manufacturing system; the aim being to investigate which and how commonly available manufacturing data can be used for this purpose, rather then proposing further theoretical measures to a well established framework. A careful literature review and the analysis of common data available have in fact pointed out that flexibility measures can be often determined only as a result of massive, expensive and ad hoc data collection campaigns. On the other hand, general manufacturing and costs available data, such as production mix, bill of materials, manufacturing and assembly cycles, ABC sales, and main costs elements, may anyway be helpful in evaluating some flexibility dimensions [1]. These themes have been empirically tested and experienced through the analysis of a real manufacturing case represented by a firm producing <b>pneumatic</b> equipment for <b>automation.</b> The case, for the issues presented, can be considered representative of how flexibility indexes, particularly machine flexibility one, can be built in modern firms of mechanical line of business. Main outcomes underline how meaningful and useful flexibility parameters can be determined using system common manufacturing data...|$|R
