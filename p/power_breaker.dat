30|$|Through EIS control, TCPST can be {{acted as}} {{a new type of}} {{short-circuit}} current suppresser for power system secure operation, it might also have several potential issues from the viewpoint of power equipments, including fault interruption time requirements for <b>power</b> <b>breakers</b> and the potential ancillary mechanical support.|$|R

The main contribution of this study is providing new thoughts of changing the equivalent series impedance of TCPST that is associated with the transmission line, thus suppressing the short-circuit fault current level when the <b>power</b> <b>breakers</b> are ordered to interrupt the fault.|$|R
40|$|The {{past years}} showed {{to the world}} and to the European Union that {{classical}} approaches are not enough to be a <b>power</b> <b>breaker</b> in the Caucasian region, where the overlap of history, myth, and cultures creates a unique geopolitical context marked by century old grudges and imaginary or real socio-economical issues. It is clear that concepts like “ring of friends” or Eastern Partnership need a rebranding and an upgrade due to contemporary context changes. Russian expansion, Turkish political shifts, Ukrainian crisis, Iranian ambitions, Kurd issues, energy policies and socio-economical convulsions are defining the new shape of the geographical areas on both side of the Caucasus Mountain. In this context the European leadership needs to rethink the foreign policy approach to the region and to create a new set of actions in this context. This difficult task is needed not only from the perspective of Europe’s energetic security but from the point of regional stability, because Europe and its global development depend on its involvement in the neighboring regions. From this perspective our paper would like to analyze and create a realistic image on the dynamic of the relations of EU with the countries in this region and the perspectives in the contemporary context where the overlapping geopolitical interests are making this region a key one for several future issues...|$|E
40|$|Transmission of {{reactive}} power {{is well known}} to cause active power losses. Thus, new components who can help minimizing these expensive {{reactive power}} flows are {{of great interest to}} the power distribution companies. ABB Corporate Research has developed the first electronic <b>power</b> <b>breaker.</b> One possible application for this breaker is transient-free switching of capacitor banks. This could prove a useful distribution voltage complement to the switch-sync technique, mainly applied to transmission voltage level. The Swedish grid is characterized by long distances between power plants and customers, hence long transmission lines carrying loads of varying sizes are frequent. This implies that reactive power compensation by capacitors will be necessary. Furthermore, a freedom of choice when to put specific capacitor banks into operation is desired to keep power losses at a minimum. However, capacitor bank switching at voltage levels below 130 kV is strictly regulated today due to the problems of transients. The scope of this report is to assess the economic potential of the electronic breaker concerning transient-free switching of capacitor banks. This has been achieved by comparing two cases of operating systems, controlling the shunt capacitors in a west-Swedish region network. The first case models todays operation scheme where shunts are divided into four categories, depending on how often they can be employed. The second case resembles a future situation where all capacitor banks can be put into/out of operation anytime, hence assuming transient-free switching. The two cases were implemented as IPLAN-programs in a PSS/E context. The shunt operations were controlled by an optimal power flow tool. A full year has been succesfully simulated on hour-basis. Load statistics were used in order to resemble how the active and reactive loads fluctuate over the year. The results show a significant decrease in active power losses for the future case. Consequently, the economic potential for applications of this kind could not be dismissed...|$|E

5000|$|When first encountering {{this type}} of mine in the 1940s the British Royal Navy responded {{with a series of}} devices that {{produced}} loud noises underwater to trigger the mines [...] Experiments were made with jackhammers, sirens, handgrenades , and bundles of loose metal pipes. They eventually settles on the jackhammer also called a breaker. This was initially set up to hammer against a bulkhead of a minesweeper but this resulted in the mine exploding dangerously close to the vessel. The hammer was then located in a metal box that was extended over the bows of the ship so that its sound preceded the ship itself. Towing the hammer in a floating vessel {{off to the side of}} the ship was also used.

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{of the relationship between}} wave and meteorological variables and beach morphology was undertaken during the summer and winter periods, 1971 - 1972, on Plum Island, Massachusetts. Variables were measured or computed bihourly, 24 hours per day, throughout both study periods. The variables were wave period, wave height, breaker type, breaker angle, longshore current velocity, wave steepness, <b>breaker</b> <b>power,</b> wind speed and direction, barometric pressure, air and water temperature, and ground water elevation. Daily topographic maps of the intertidal zone were constructed for 12 beach profiles spaced at 60 -meter intervals. Variations in beach process variables, during both the summer and winter periods, were directly related to the passage of high- and low-pressure systems and to the proximity of the system to Plum Island. With an increase in <b>breaker</b> <b>power</b> and <b>breaker</b> steepness, the high tide beach-face gradient increased. Increases in <b>breaker</b> <b>power</b> also resulted in a {{rise to the level of}} the ground water surface. Although most process variables were similar for the summer and winter periods, strong offshore winds and extreme low temperatures that accompany polar high-pressure systems are unique to the winter period. Difference in bach morphology within a small area appear to reflect the state of recovery of the beach profiles after a storm. Adjacent profiles at different stages of maturity are controlled by the proximity of the nearshore bar. The closer the bar is to shore, the faster the sediment is returned to the beach zone...|$|R

The proposed method allows to discriminate different signals acquired by sensors and coming contemporarily from different sources. A subsequent recognition technique based on signal processing procedures is then applied to identify any anomalies in the different parts of the structure.

50|$|A small motor can {{be started}} by simply {{plugging}} {{it into an}} electrical receptacle or by using a switch or circuit breaker. A larger motor requires a specialized switching unit called a motorstarter or motor contactor. When energized, a direct on line (DOL) starter immediately connects the motor terminals directly to the power supply. Reduced-voltage, star-delta or soft starters connect the motor to the power supply through a voltage reduction device and increases the applied voltage gradually or in steps. In smaller sizes a motor starter is a manually operated switch; larger motors, or those requiring remote or automatic control, use magnetic contactors.
