5|$|Unaware of Bart's shoplifting, Marge {{takes the}} family to the same store to get their annual Christmas <b>picture</b> <b>taken.</b> Bart tries to avoid {{detection}} and trouble, but is spotted by Brodka, who shows a disbelieving Marge and Homer the security tape of Bart shoplifting. Disappointed by Bart's actions and concerned that she may be mothering him too much, Marge decides that he {{is old enough to}} make his own decisions and becomes distant with him. Fearing he has lost Marge's love, Bart decides he must regain it.|$|E
5|$|The Birmingham Mail {{reported}} on 9 January that the programme had attracted {{an influx of}} tourists to the street, who wished to have their <b>picture</b> <b>taken</b> by the James Turner Street road sign. Police advised visitors to stay away. Steve Chalke, founder of the Oasis Academy Foundry, a charity that runs a primary school in James Turner Street, subsequently said that visitors had disrupted activity at the school {{and that he was}} preparing a complaint for Ofcom. Shortly afterwards, he submitted a letter to the watchdog alleging that children had been subject to public harassment because of the programme, and that Ofcom's rules regarding the welfare of those under the age of majority had been breached. On 13 February, newspapers, including the Daily Mirror and Daily Star, reported the theft of the James Turner Street road sign from outside the school.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the size}} of objects is {{increased}} {{in proportion to the}} enhanced depth, there is no miniaturization effect as with hyperstereo, but the same telephoto compression seen in extreme zoom flat photographs also occurs. Specifically, there is a reduction in the relative sizes of objects at different distances so that objects that are further away appear to be larger than closer objects that are actually the same size. Note that this effect is negligible at lower zoom levels and most observers cannot distinguish between telephoto <b>pictures</b> <b>taken</b> with wide base and normal <b>pictures</b> <b>taken</b> with a normal base at an equivalent distance. So <b>pictures</b> <b>taken</b> at 40 feet with a 4x zoom and a 10-inch base will appear similar to <b>pictures</b> <b>taken</b> at 10 feet with no zoom and a 2.5-inch base.|$|R

Elsewhere, a man named Martin (Guy Fauchon) is arrested after slitting a babysitter's throat at a public park; despite the seemingly random nature of the crime, Black believes that the man may be connected to Bletcher's murder. However, he soon starts to suspect that Martin may be innocent of the crime he has been arrested for. Black also has a dream in which a mutilated Bletcher tries and fails to speak to him, which leads Black to believe he has lost his ability to see into the minds of others.|$|E

25|$|The {{airport was}} {{designed}} to be larger than any in the world, bigger in size than the New York, London, Berlin, Paris, Chicago, and Philadelphia ones put together. Woodhouse claimed it would eventually become the combined size of the airports of Croydon in London, Le Bourget in Paris, Tempelhof in Berlin, Roosevelt Field in New York, Chicago's Air Park, and Boston's Jeffery Field. However, the airport never did develop as intended and a 1949 <b>picture</b> <b>taken</b> from an airplane showed no evidence of the three world's longest runways which had been illustrated in earlier depictions.|$|E
25|$|The {{scientific}} {{goals of}} both surveys {{range from the}} nature of dark energy to assessing near-Earth objects. Teams of European astronomers will conduct the surveys; some will cover most of the southern sky, while others will focus on smaller areas. VISTA and the VST are expected to produce large amounts of data; a single <b>picture</b> <b>taken</b> by VISTA has 67megapixels, and images from OmegaCam (on the VST) will have 268megapixels. The two survey telescopes will collect more data every night {{than all the other}} instruments on the VLT combined. The VST and VISTA will produce more than 100 terabytes of data per year.|$|E

25|$|Memorabilia are {{singular}} objects {{which are}} passed {{down through the}} family with the stories and memories about events or individuals attached to them. In one family a doll, given once as a Christmas present, continued to be brought out each year to celebrate Christmas and have her <b>picture</b> <b>taken</b> with the (changing) family. For her hundredth birthday, a birthday cake for the doll {{was included in the}} Christmas celebration. Like the doll, almost any object imbued with family stories and memories can become a family heirloom. As such, it holds in the family a value often unrelated to its monetary value. As the stories and memories enveloping the object are slowly lost, the object itself becomes a simple hand-me-down, usually in poor condition and ready to be discarded.|$|E
25|$|He {{appeared}} in The Abominable Dr. Phibes (1971), its sequel Dr. Phibes Rises Again (1972), and Theatre of Blood (1973), {{in which he}} portrayed one {{of a pair of}} campy serial killers. That same year Price appeared as himself in Mooch Goes to Hollywood, a film written by Jim Backus. Price was an admirer of the works of Edgar Allan Poe and in 1975 visited the Edgar Allan Poe Museum (Richmond, Virginia), where he had his <b>picture</b> <b>taken</b> with the museum's popular stuffed raven. Price recorded dramatic readings of Edgar Allan Poe's short stories and poems, which were collected together with readings by Basil Rathbone. In 1975, Price and his wife Coral Browne appeared together in an international stage adaptation of Ardèle which played in the USA as well as in London at the Queen's Theatre. During this run, Browne & Price starred together in a BBC Radio play Night of the Wolf first airing in 1975.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Sultaana Freeman (formerly Sandra Keller, who {{converted}} to Islam in 1997 when marrying a Muslim man), sued the U.S. state of Florida {{for the right}} to wear a niqab for her driver's license photo. However, a Florida appellate court ruled that there was no violation in the state requiring her to show her face to a camera in a private room with only a female employee to take the picture, in exchange for the privilege of driving. The prevailing view in Florida is currently that hiding one's face on a form of photo identification defeats the purpose of having the <b>picture</b> <b>taken,</b> although 15 other states (including Arkansas, California, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, and Louisiana) have provisions that allow for driver's licenses absent of an identifying photograph in order to accommodate individuals who may have a religious reason to not have a photograph taken. In 2012, a string of armed robberies in Philadelphia were committed by people disguised in traditional Islamic woman's garb; Muslim leaders were concerned that the use of the disguises could put Muslim women in danger of hate crimes and inflame ethnic tensions.|$|E

After the photograph was published in newspapers across the United States, Hartnett received a telegram from Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis instructing him not to have his photograph taken with Capone in the future. Hartnett replied with a telegram to the Commissioner whimsically stating, [...] "OK, but if you don't want me to have my <b>picture</b> <b>taken</b> with Al Capone, you tell him." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} for [...] "I've Got a Feeling" [...] was created with an unknown release date.

As Durand continues singing, several individuals enter and exit the room while getting their <b>picture</b> <b>taken,</b> each leaving with a CD in their hand.
