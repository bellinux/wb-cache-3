The influences of hydrolysis time and molar mass of NC on the molar ratio of nitrite-to-nitrate ions were investigated, and new insights into the understanding of the alkaline denitration mechanism of NCs, underlying this analytical strategy is provided.

40|$|The Las Vegas Wash {{receives}} {{runoff from}} the Las Vegas Valley {{which includes the}} City of Las Vegas, City of North Las Vegas, City of Henderson, and other outlying areas. The annual precipitation in this arid region is approximately four to five inches. In this study, intense spatial and temporal sampling of urban runoff was performed in washes located throughout the Las Vegas Valley. The source of these flows comes primarily from irrigating landscapes, shallow groundwater, and rainfall excess. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the quality of runoff at these locations and to characterize the temporal variability of urban runoff during wet and dry periods. This is critical since there is a lack of comprehensive data for arid regions. <b>Preliminary</b> <b>dry</b> weather runoff results show a clear difference between locations that are influenced by shallow groundwater and locations that have runoff generated only from urban areas. During wet weather, the water quality analysis suggests that the peak concentrations in many constituents (e. g., chemical oxygen demand, Nitrogen, and Phosphorous) occurs about one to two hours prior to the peak water level in the storm channels. This is important when suggesting solutions for minimizing the adverse impacts to water quality. There is also an increase in total suspended solids (TSS) during rainfall events which is important for determining the potential of contaminants being transported downstream.

40|$|Abstract- A {{technique}} for estimating the thermal dispersion coefficients in a granular medium (packed bed of monodisperse glass beads), originally developed for {{water as a}} flowing fluid, has been adapted for an air flow. Thermocouples in the downstream neighbourhood of a line heat source measure the temperature response to a step power input. The estimation of the different parameters of the model (one-temperature model) is made by least squares minimization of the temperature residuals term that is augmented by a regularization term based on the prior approximate knowledge of the thermocouple locations. It is shown, both theoretically and experimentally that, contrary to the water case, both dispersion coefficients (longitudinal and transverse) {{as well as the}} Darcy velocity, can be reached for air as a working fluid. The same technique has been tested for solid grains with internal micro-porosity. The first experimental temperature responses do not obey the previous model. The presence of adsorbed water in micro-pores of the grains, whose evaporation is caused by the decrease of the relative humidity of air, constitutes an additional negative heat source term. An experimental work, where ambient air is replaced by dry nitrogen, allows the <b>preliminary</b> <b>drying</b> of the grains. Correction of the strong temperature drifts caused by initial non-equilibrium, yields temperature signals that can be inverted with satisfactory residuals. 1...|$|E

Higher magnification electron micrographs of the OsO 4 -fixed preparations showed a sequence of modifications of the myelin layers which could be correlated with changes in the small-angle x-ray diffraction data which were recorded during drying. An intermediate stage of drying was characterised by a partial collapse of layers and a disappearance of the intraperiod dense line in some regions of the myelin sheath. Continuity between collapsed and non-collapsed layers was maintained throughout the sheath. The fully dried preparation showed two main modifications of the myelin layers. In many regions the layers (principal layers) resembled those of normal preparations, but showed an intensification and frequently a doubling of the intraperiod dense line. In addition, there was a very extensive system of fine (40 A periodicity) dense layers, some of which could be demonstrated to be continuous with the principal layers.

Its major {{considerations}} are kiln design, moisture content data (for use in drying schedules), and <b>preliminary</b> <b>drying</b> schedules. Project conclusions result from literature review and experimentation. Regarding kiln design for uniformity and efficiency, the researcher found the following principles of utmost importance: 1) proper direction of airflow (achieved by incorporating measures that will direct the airflow, such as baffling and air deflectors); 2) maximizing space by fitting the maximum number of drying racks into the kiln and using a small spacing (9 cm) between drying trays; and 3) minimizing electric costs by installing a heat source other than electric auxiliary heat, as well as operating the kiln continuously until materials are dry. Regarding moisture content (MC), the research found that herbal teas should be dried to 5 - 10 percent MC (green basis), and that the moisture contents of most green materials collected in Haines were too variable to use for creating drying schedules. Regarding drying schedules, the research found that pre-drying plant materials in ambient air for about a day improves quality and efficiency of the kiln drying process. Material depth for some materials, including dandelion and fireweed leaf. The main problem identified was the variation in drying rates between different leaf parts (leaf blades dried out much faster than midveins and became brittle).

40|$|Water is a safe, harmless, and {{environmentally}} benign solvent. From an eco-sustainable chemistry perspective, {{the use of}} water instead of organic solvent is preferred to decrease environmental contamination. Moreover, water has unique physical and chemical properties, such as high dielectric constant and high cohesive energy density compared to most organic solvents. The different interactions between water and substrates, make water an interesting candidate as a solvent or co-solvent from an industrial and laboratory perspective. In this regard, organic reactions in aqueous media are of current interest. In addition, from practical and synthetic standpoints, a great advantage of using water is immediately evident, since {{it does not require}} any <b>preliminary</b> <b>drying</b> process. This thesis was found on this aspect of chemical research, with particular attention to the mechanisms which control organo and bio-catalysis outcome. The first part of the study was focused on the aldol reaction. In particular, for the first time it has been analyzed {{for the first time the}} stereoselectivity of the condensation reaction between 3 -pyridincarbaldehyde and the cyclohexanone, catalyzed by morpholine and 4 -tertbutyldimethylsiloxyproline, using water as sole solvent. This interest has resulted in countless works appeared in the literature concerning the use of proline derivatives as effective catalysts in organic aqueous environment. These studies showed good enantio and diastereoselectivities but they did not present an in depth study of the reaction mechanism. The analysis of the products diastereomeric ratios through the Eyring equation allowed to compare the activation parameters (ΔΔH≠ and ΔΔS≠) of the diastereomeric reaction paths, and to compare the different type of catalysis. While morpholine showed constant diasteromeric ratio at all temperatures, the O(TBS) -L-proline, showed a non-linear Eyring diagram, with two linear trends and the presence of an inversion temperature (Tinv) at 53 ° C, which denotes the presence of solvation effects by water. A pH-dependent study allowed to identify two different reaction mechanisms, and in the case of O(TBS) -L-proline, to ensure the formation of an enaminic species, as a keyelement in the stereoselective process. Moreover, it has been studied the possibility of using the 6 - aminopenicillanic acid (6 -APA) as amino acid-type catalyst for aldol condensation between cyclohexanone and aromatic aldehydes. A detailed analysis of the catalyst regarding its behavior in different organic solvents and pH, allowed to prove its potential as a candidate for green catalysis. Best results were obtained in neat conditions, where 6 -APA proved to be an effective catalyst in terms of yields. The catalyst performance in terms of enantio- and diastereo-selectivity, was impaired by the competition between two different catalytic mechanisms: one via imine-enamine mechanism and one via a Bronsted-acid catalysis. The last part of the thesis was dedicated to the enzymatic catalysis, with particular attention to the use of an enzyme belonging to the class of alcohol dehydrogenase, the Horse Liver Alcohol Dehydrogenase (HLADH) which was selected and used in the enantioselective reduction of aldehydes to enantiopure arylpropylic alcohols. This enzyme has showed an excellent responsiveness to this type of aldehydes and a good tolerance toward organic solvents. Moreover, the fast keto-enolic equilibrium of this class of aldehydes that induce the stereocentre racemization, allows the dynamic-kinetic resolution (DKR) to give the enantiopure alcohol. By analyzing the different reaction parameters, especially the pH and the amount of enzyme, and adding a small percentage of organic solvent, it was possible to control all the parameters involved in the reaction. The excellent enatioselectivity of HLADH along with the DKR of arylpropionic aldehydes, allowed to obtain the corresponding alcohols in quantitative yields and with an optical purity ranging from 64...|$|E

The results showed, large bulbs or bulbs of larger neck diameter had lower quality after 8 month ventilated storage, mainly due to high weight loss, mould decay or insect decay. 本篇試驗研究係就不同型態之蒜球(Carlic,Allium sativum L.) ，包括三種粗細之梗(直) 徑與三種球大小之球(直) 徑等級，於自然通風環境下(22 ~ 31 ℃、 70 ~ 87 ％RH) 貯藏 8 個月，比較其出庫品質優劣，藉以瞭解其貯藏力之高低。結果顯示，大球徑(5. 91 ± 1. 5 mm) 以及粗梗徑(12. 7 ± 1. 7 mm) 的蒜球，貯藏品質較差，貯藏可售率皆有偏低現象。不同梗粗徑的蒜球之中，粗梗蒜球的貯藏失重率、乾腐情形以及蟲蛀的發生比率皆明顯偏高，細梗(8. 9 (0. 99 mm) 蒜球除了失重率、乾腐少及蟲蛀的現象較少之外，黴腐之發生率亦較低，因此細梗蒜球的貯藏可售率明顯高於粗梗蒜球(約 3. 7 倍) 。不同球徑大小的蒜球之中球徑越大者越容易出現貯藏失重、黴腐與蟲蛀現象，於通風貯藏 8 個月後，大球徑者貯藏可售率明顯偏低(＜ 40 ％) ，小球的可售率則仍高達 70 ％。球徑大小與梗徑粗細不同的蒜球，貯藏後芽長比及瓣肉品質皆頗為接近，差異並不大；在曲褶芽發生情形方面，細梗蒜球較中、粗梗蒜球容易發生，中、小球之曲褶芽發生率則比大球多；在發根長度方面，梗徑不同的蒜球之間，差異並不大，但球徑大小不同蒜球之間，大球較容易長根，中、小球發根長度皆較短而且兩者長度相近。由於大球徑與粗梗徑的蒜球，在自然通風環境下的長期貯藏品質，明顯不如小球徑與細梗球徑的蒜球，因此宜避免採用大球徑與粗梗的蒜球進行長期自然通風貯藏...|$|R
30|$|The {{first stage}} {{began with the}} painted sketch and underpaint. This initial design, traces of which are still visible in many areas, defined Saul’s tunic, sleeve, and a cloak hanging at his back with freely sketched lines of black paint and yellow and white impasto highlights, typical for Rembrandt’s practice. At this point, {{the arm of the}} chair was fairly developed, as best seen in the false-color {{reflectance}} image (Fig.  2). After this <b>preliminary</b> sketch had <b>dried,</b> the forms were refined: the white and yellow in the torso were muted with dull greenish paint and several changes expanded the cloak over Saul’s arm, his leg, and the arm of the chair. Still in the first stage, black paint was used to resketch the cloak on the shoulder and upper arm. Subsequently, this black resketch as well as the yellow and white highlights were scraped down in the sleeve, a red-lake glaze was hastily brushed over most of the cloak, and a mass of parallel back-and-forth strokes in dull red paint defined the fall of fabric across the top part of the arm of the chair (faintly visible in the false-color reflectance image).|$|R
40|$|Our study {{involves}} {{the design and}} fabrication of semiconductor devices in the first semiconductor fabrication laboratory at the Virginia Military Institute. As {{this is a new}} laboratory, <b>preliminary</b> wet and <b>dry</b> silicon oxidation studies are performed to 1) develop necessary photolithography skills, 2) thoroughly characterize oxidation equipment, and 3) determine the proper processing parameters for both barrier and transistor gate oxide layers for device realization. The final portion of our study {{involves the}} fabrication of semiconductor devices, including resistors, p-n junction diodes, and n-channel E-MOS transistors. Here, our preliminary studies are extended to include mask design, dopant diffusion processing, aluminum contact deposition, and device characterization. Results of the study include oxide thickness measurements, sheet resistivity measurements, and device I-V curves. In addition, each device is replicated {{across the surface of the}} wafer to provide multiple data, and to allow us to evaluate process uniformity. The experiences and the results of this study will benefit the students at Virginia Military Institute who are interested in the semiconductor fabrication field. In this regard, we have completed processing guidelines and equipment-use instructions for students who will attend this laboratory in the future...|$|R
40|$|CO 2 is a {{greenhouse}} gas {{that has been}} increasing in concentration in the atmosphere, and rivers and streams {{have been identified as}} sources of carbon dioxide. However, little is known about CO 2 fluxes from intermittent rivers and streams, which have channels that cease to flow at one point or another and make up around one half of the global river network length. The objective of this project is to measure CO 2 fluxes from an intermittent stream network in SE Idaho to assess the relationship between CO 2 flux and air and stream temperature, dissolved organic carbon concentration and stream flow, including the dry stream sections. CO 2 fluxes were measured every 200 meters in the stream network (100 points total), once in early summer and again in the later months of summer to capture changes with the stream <b>drying.</b> <b>Preliminary</b> CO 2 fluxes ranged from 0. 01 to 4. 6 g/m 2 hr, with an average flux of 0. 63 g/m 2 hr. The CO 2 fluxes measured will increase the understanding of the role that intermittent streams play in global CO 2 emissions...|$|R
40|$|An XRF {{specimen}} {{preparation method}} {{was developed to}} quantify the concentration of gallium in plutonium metal while minimizing the risk of contaminating the instrument with radioactive material. To ensure that homogeneous specimens are examined, plutonium is dissolved in dilute HCl and HNO{sub 3 } prior to analysis. In the preliminary work here, non-radioactive aqueous gallium standards were prepared, and zinc was added as an internal standard to improve the accuracy and precision. Aliquots from these solutions were cast on Mylar XRF films and air dried prior to analysis. Two methods of casting the solutions were evaluated: (1) casting as a thin layer using a surfactant to wet the support film and (2) casting multiple small spots on the support film. Aqueous gallium standards were prepared and cast as dried residue specimens using each method. These specimens were then analyzed, and calibration curves were prepared. Highly linear calibrations were obtained for each preparation method when zinc {{was used as the}} internal standard (RMS values {le} 1 % of the standards concentration range in both cases). Based on this <b>preliminary</b> work, this <b>dried</b> residue process appears very promising for the accurate quantification of gallium in plutonium...|$|R
40|$|Good {{combination}} of pulping variables {{is required to}} obtain the quality pulp and paper characteristics. Thus, in this <b>preliminary</b> work, naturally <b>dried</b> durian rind were pulped under Soda-Anthraquinone (Soda-AQ) pulping process with 18 % to 22 % alkali charge, 0 % to 0. 1 % Anthraquinone (AQ) charge, 90 minutes to 150 minutes of cooking time and 150 °C to 170 °C to investigate the effect of pulping variables {{on the characteristics of}} the pulp and paper. Pulping condition with 0 % of AQ charge was also conducted for comparison. Results indicated that the best screen yield percentage, reject yield percentage, freeness, drainage time, tear index, number of folds and optical properties were shown by the pulp produced with {{combination of}} the highest active alkali (22 %), AQ charge (0. 1 %), cooking time (150 minutes) and cooking temperature (170 °C) except apparent density, tensile index and burst index. This preliminary result shows that the optimum quality of durian rind pulp as a potential papermaking raw material pulp could be produced by selecting the good combination of pulping variables which influences the pulp and paper characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Hollow glass {{microspheres}} (HGMs) are {{a unique}} class of materials with interconnected nano-pores in the microsphere walls, which can adsorb, retain and release hydrogen and other gases. In this study, HGMs was prepared from amber coloured and borosilicate glass frits. The glass frits after the <b>preliminary</b> washing and <b>drying</b> was sized to particles below 120 µm. The hollow glass microspheres were successfully fabricated {{from the glass}} powder by flame spheroidisation using air-acetylene flame. Effect of glass feed particle size as well as feed rate, {{in the formation of}} HGMs was studied. Amber glass feed particle size> 75 µm was found to give very poor yield ( 95 %) for HGMs. In the case of borosilicate glass feed, particle size 38 - 63 µm gave around 80 % conversion to HGMs. Further, study of the process parameters and constant monitoring to regulate the process are being carried out in our laboratory to arrive at a correct figure for the yield of HGMs. Characterisation of the HGMs prepared was done using Image analysing system, SEM, and XRD. The composition of the raw material and the product HGMs were determined using ICP-AES...|$|R
40|$|Dry etching {{techniques}} employing {{ion beam}} induced surface reaction {{and the possibility}} of highly charged ion beam in dry etching are described, and the <b>preliminary</b> work on <b>dry</b> etching of GaAs using highly charged ion (HCI) is also presented. In usual dry etching, total etch rate is a summation of the physical sputtering rate, the chemical etching rate, and the ion-induced chemical etching rate. When Ar q+ /Cl 2 /GaAs system is used, the ion-induced chemical etching yield which is the key issue in dry etching to obtain the good controllability is enhanced by the charge state of HCI as well as the physical sputtering yield. Application of HCI to materials processing is also discussed briefly. Key issues in dry etching As well known, dry etching {{is one of the most}} important technique in materials processing, especially in large scale integrated circuit (LSI) fabrication. Figure 1 shows a schematic illustration of the dry etching process. Etching reactions proceed at surface which is partially covered with photoresist mask under the ion bombarding. Though ions direct onto the surface and does not etch under the mask pattern, active radicals generated in plasma etch side walls and causes undercutting...|$|R
