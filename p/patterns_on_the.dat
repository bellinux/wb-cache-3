5|$|The pygmy slow loris has a diploid {{chromosome}} number of 2n=50. Although the banding <b>patterns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chromosomes of all slow lorises are similar, this species may be distinguished from the Bengal slow loris (N.bengalensis) by distinct differences in the number and location of nucleolus organizer regions.|$|E

5|$|Unknown {{before the}} Apollo 15 mission, there are {{parallel}} linear <b>patterns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{faces of the}} mountains in the area. Although {{they appeared to be}} occurrences of fracturing or layering appearing through the regolith, determining this is made difficult by the lighting circumstances during the mission. A dark band on Mount Hadley, believed to be a marking left by lava after receding, was observed by the Apollo 15 crew.|$|E
5|$|A {{comprehensive}} analysis {{conducted in}} 1980 by Hopson questioned Thulborn's ideas. Hopson {{showed that the}} wear facet <b>patterns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> teeth in fact indicate vertical and lateral rather than back and forth jaw movements. Furthermore, Hopson demonstrated variability {{in the degree of}} tooth wear, indicating continuous tooth replacement. He did acknowledge that X-ray images of the most complete specimen showed that this individual indeed lacked unerupted replacement teeth. According to Hopson, this indicated that only juveniles continuously replaced their teeth, and that this process ceased when reaching adulthood. Thulborn's aestivation hypothesis was rejected by Hopson due to lack of evidence.|$|E
5|$|Arson {{investigators}} testified as to {{how they}} had located the origin and cause of the house fire, stressing that the multiple unconnected, small fires they had found in the home's basement were evidence of the fire having been set purposely and that char <b>patterns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> house's floors were evidence of a liquid accelerant having been used to start the fire. The living room floor had contained the most significant amount of accelerant, and the trail of accelerant had ended {{at the door of the}} master bedroom, which had been open while the fire burned. The state of the bedroom door contradicted Green's prior testimony to investigators that her bedroom door had been closed and she had only opened it briefly to look into the hallway.|$|E
50|$|The Philippine hawk-owls are earless. The {{males and}} females look much alike. They differ in size and <b>pattern</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bottom side. N. reyi and N. spilonota are the biggest and N. philippensis, N. spilocephala and N. mindorensis <b>the</b> smallest. <b>The</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bottom side of N. reyi, N. p. spilonota and N. mindorensis is checked. <b>The</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>on</b> all <b>the</b> other species are striped.|$|R

Their away kit is the mirror image of this, all white shirts, shorts and socks with <b>the</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shirt in sky blue.|$|R
50|$|Many {{specimens}} have {{a somewhat}} regular dark 'hourglass' <b>pattern</b> located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scapular region, {{and may also}} have small reddish-brown tubercles in a scattered <b>pattern</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dorsum.|$|R
5|$|Besides {{having the}} world's largest {{collection}} of captive wildfowl, Slimbridge takes part in research and is involved in projects and internationally run captive breeding programmes. It was there that Peter Scott developed a method of recognising individual birds through their characteristics, after realising that the coloured <b>patterns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beaks of Bewick's swans were unique. The public can visit the reserve throughout the year. Besides examining the collections, they can view birds from hides and observatories and take part in educational activities.|$|E
5|$|Nokian Tyres {{produces}} tyres {{for passenger}} cars, SUVs, and vans. Nokian branded tyres {{are sold in}} over 60 countries. Nokian Tyres designed the first winter tyres in 1934 and has more winter tyre patents than any other manufacturer. Nokian Tyres {{is known for its}} winter tyres, {{not to be confused with}} all-season tyres. Nokian winter tyres have been described as a favourite of critics and have been well received in winter test results by several publications. Nokian also has designed some winter tyre models with low rolling resistance, offering lower fuel consumption. Nokian was the first company to produce a tyre that allowed for year-round use by having different tread <b>patterns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lateral and medial aspect of the tread. One pattern is optimised for winter and another pattern is designed as an all-season pattern.|$|E
5|$|The {{stopping}} <b>patterns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line {{have generally}} been determined by several different termini. The steam era saw these termini change quite frequently as more terminating facilities were constructed: the first trains on the line after the Waterfall extension in 1887 either ran to Hurstville (16 per day), Sutherland (two per day) and Waterfall (two per day), with all trains stopping at every intermediate station. By 1907, however, Como and Oatley had {{been added to the}} list of termini, with nine and seven trains per day respectively. Seven trains per day at this time also ran to Sutherland, and one to Waterfall. Most trains terminated at Hurstville.|$|E

5|$|The two Amtrak tracks {{share an}} island platform; the RTA tracks {{do not have}} any platforms. The {{structure}} has a porte-cochère, which protects passengers from inclement weather. The interior was built with a similar design to that of the exterior, and features a central skylight. Shadows from its exposed trusses create different <b>patterns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> brown brick floor, built in a basket-weaved pattern. Exposed ductwork is visible throughout the trusses, as are the light fixtures. All of the ceiling elements are painted white, which tend to recede and produce a sense of airiness which is further enhanced by the floor-to-ceiling windows. Banks of seats are located close to public telephones and a vending area.|$|E
5|$|The varying <b>patterns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tail flukes {{distinguish}} individual animals. A {{study using}} data from 1973 to 1998 on whales in the North Atlantic gave researchers detailed information on gestation times, growth rates and calving periods, as well as allowing more accurate population predictions by simulating the mark-release-recapture technique. A photographic catalogue of all known North Atlantic whales was developed over this period and is maintained by College of the Atlantic. Similar photographic identification projects operate around the world.|$|E
