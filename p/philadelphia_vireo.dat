50|$|The {{songs and}} calls of <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>vireo</b> are {{three to five}} notes, weeezh weeezh weeezh, {{very similar to those}} of the red-eyed vireo.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>vireo</b> (Vireo philadelphicus) {{is a small}} North American {{songbird}} in the vireo family (Vireonidae). [...] "Vireo" [...] is a Latin word {{referring to}} a green migratory bird, perhaps the female golden oriole, possibly the European greenfinch. The specific philadelphicus is {{for the city of}} Philadelphia.|$|E
50|$|Adults {{are mainly}} olive-brown on the upperparts with yellow underparts; they have {{dark eyes and}} a grey crown. They have no wing bars and no eye ring. There is a dark line through the eyes and a white stripe just over them. They have thick blue-grey legs and a stout bill. The <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>vireo</b> is similar in {{appearance}} to the warbling vireo, but can be reliably distinguished by having much yellower underparts, and dark lores.|$|E
50|$|The species whose nests {{are known}} all build a {{cup-shaped}} nest that hangs from branches. Its outer layer {{is made of}} coarse leaf and bark strips or of moss, depending on the species; in either case the material is bound with spider silk and ornamented with spider egg cases. The lining is made of fine grass stems neatly circling the cup. In most species both sexes work on the nest, but the female adds the lining. In the red-eyed, black-whiskered, Yucatan, and <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>vireos</b> the male does not help, instead singing and accompanying the female while she builds the nest. The female {{does most of the}} incubation, spelled by the male except in the red-eyed vireo complex.|$|R
40|$|Overall, {{this fall}} {{migration}} was routine (waterfowl, warblers, sparrows), {{but there were}} a few unexpected highlights. The flooded Missouri River Valley provided habitat that led to some amazing fall counts: 3000 pelicans, 5700 coots, 338 American Golden-Plovers, and 1200 Pectoral Sandpipers. The 10, 000 cormorants at Harlan County Reservoir may not have been affected by the Missouri River flooding, and were a record count also. While we 2 ̆ 7 re talking numbers, the martin roost in Omaha topped out at 50, 000 – 55, 000, and seasonal totals of 4 Red-necked Grebes and 15 <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>Vireos</b> for the state, 34 Mississippi Kites over Ogallala (it 2 ̆ 7 s often hard to find one), and 45 Lesser Goldfinches banded at Wildcat Hills Nature Center were interesting tallies. Surprising many was the rare occurrence of 4000 – 5000 Sandhill Cranes lingering late into fall; the reports of 5 Snowy Owls {{before the end of the}} period also was a hint of what might follow. Also surprising was the low number of Black-capped Chickadees reported in south-central Nebraska; the NOU meeting held at Audubon Rowe Sanctuary reported chickadees in only one of the 12 counties covered by participants. And, of course, there is always the weird. Two species of vagrant psittacids were reported, neither a threat to our native birds: a Rosy-faced Lovebird and a Budgerigar. One reporter found a Burrowing Owl on the grounds of an Omaha Lowes store (strange enough), but a subsequent reporter, looking for the owl, turned up a Smith 2 ̆ 7 s Longspur in the same place. Maybe I’ve been trying too hard for the Smith 2 ̆ 7 s! And finally, a Rufous Hummingbird appeared in a Lincoln yard in mid·Sep and stayed there all fall until it was captured on 10 Nov and sent to hummingbird heaven at the Henry Doorly Zoo...|$|R
40|$|This {{spring was}} a {{definite}} mixed bag ornithologically, {{in large part}} due to the mixed bag of weather conditions. Spring Beauty flowers bloomed 10 – 14 days early at Fontenelle Forest (RBa). Observers were decidedly mixed in their assessments of the season; veteran observers commenting on the passerine migration noted “poorest spring for passerines that I can recall” (LE) and “the sheer numbers of birds seemed ridiculously high for this early date of May 3 rd” (JR). It {{should be noted that the}} 3 May date saw record counts of a few passerine species at Fontenelle Forest: 65 American Redstarts, 60 Blackpoll Warblers, and 80 Rose-breasted Grosbeaks. Acadian Flycatcher was ubiquitous at Indian Cave SP. Impressive seasonal totals for rare migrants included 13 <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>Vireos</b> and 20 Gray-cheeked Thrushes. Few passerine migrants were found westward, however. Regarding waterbirds, similar mixed opinions and data came to hand; even though few ibises were seen in the Rainwater Basin, the overall numbers seemed about average, including 2 Glossy Ibis. Perhaps of greatest interest ecologically was the earliness of the spring in several respects. Nesting began early for Cooper 2 ̆ 7 s Hawk and Great Blue Heron, and there were numerous record-early arrival dates, both in shorebirds and passerines in general; there were 4 record early dates for shorebirds (American Golden-Plover, Lesser Yellowlegs, Western Sandpiper, Stilt Sandpiper) and 3 for passerines (Yellow-rumped “Audubon’s” Warbler, Clay-colored Sparrow, Field Sparrow). Interesting observations included the first state record for Black-chinned Hummingbird, a species that is spreading northward in the western Great Plains, an amazingly late Snowy Owl picked up alive at Big Springs 29 May, but which died soon after, and a minor incursion of White-winged Cross bill...|$|R

40|$|Notable this Fall {{was very}} heavy {{coverage}} of the Panhandle during Sep-Oct, which yielded several outstanding records (all, of course, pending NOURC approval). Incredible were first Panhandle records of Golden-winged, Chestnut-sided, Bay-breasted, and Prothonotary Warblers, 3 rd record of Northern Waterthrush, and 4 th record of Blackburnian Warbler. <b>Philadelphia</b> <b>Vireo</b> {{was found in the}} Panhandle for the 3 rd time. Important also were 3 records of Hammond 2 ̆ 7 s Flycatcher, the 3 rd- 6 th for the state, and likely a regular migrant, and 5 of Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s vireo, previously known only by 2 specimens. Finally, from the Panhandle, 4 reports of Blue-Gray Gnatcatcher may be changing the status of this species there; there are still fewer than 10 such records. Just as significant were 2 surprising easterly records, Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Grebe in Lancaster Co and a Plumbeous Vireo in Stanton Co. Rarities independent of location were a potential 1 st state record Eurasian Collared-Dove at Shelton; the NOURC will decide if this was (is!) a wild bird. It was a good fall for jaegers, 4 reported (2 identified to species, a 2 nd state record Parasitic and a 4 tn state record Pomarine. A Roseate Spoonbill flew into NE airspace for the state 2 ̆ 7 s 3 rd record. The OPPD Wetlands mitigation project in e Otoe Co yielded interesting waterbirds which are lacking in e NE due to virtually lacking cattail marsh habitat. Species seen there were Least Bittern, Yellow-crowned Night-Heron, King Rail, and Common Moorhen. Other species appeared in surprising numbers. There were single-locality, single-day counts of 3 Red-necked Grebes, 20, 000 + Western Grebes, 10 Tundra Swans, 191 Hooded Mergansers, 54 Northern Harriers, 35, 000 and 30, 000 Franklin 2 ̆ 7 s Gulls, up to 30 Sabine 2 ̆ 7 s Gulls (for the season), 4000 Cliff Swallows, and 39 Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s Warblers. Late dates were provided by Common Tern, Indigo Bunting, and Nelson 2 ̆ 7 s Sharp-tailed Sparrow, for no discernible pattern! Finally, a new altitude record was set by a Brewer 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow at Panorama Point in Kimball Co, the state 2 ̆ 7 s highest point. Eat your heart out, Colorado...|$|E
