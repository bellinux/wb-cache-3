Recent results {{obtained in the}} area of transition metal photochemistry are presented. Previous developments in this field are included. The two introductory chapters deal with structure, bonding, and electronic absorption spectroscopy of transition metal complexes. The remaining six chapters deal with pathways for decay of electronically excited states: radiative decay, nonradiative decay, electronic energy transfer, redox photochemistry, photosubstitution, and photoreactions of the coordinated ligands. Highlights of this work include new convincing evidence for assigning the low lying transitions in [ [...] . ] metal carbonyls as ligand field excitations; the first definitive study of luminescence phenomena of metal carbonyls; a study of the nonradiative decay of metal carbonyl excited states with the conclusion that specific ligands can dominate the process of nonradiative decay; the first correlation of the quenching activity of a transition metal complex and its electronic properties; intramolecular energy transfer studies where one chromophore is a transition metal complex; data showing that the direct formation of CO(II) occurs via photolysis of some disubstituted cyanocobaltate(III) complexes; presentation of an associative type mechanism for the photoaquation of [ [...] . ]; a description of a set of considerations (Wrighton-Gray rules) to predict and interpret <b>photo</b> <b>substitution</b> reactions; and a discussion of the photoreactivity of alkenes, dienes, and stilbenes when coordinated to Cr(0), Mo(0) or W(0). ...|$|E
40|$|The <b>photo</b> ligand <b>substitution</b> {{reaction}} of the bisphenanthroline complex [Ru(phen) 2 B] 2 + (where phen= 1, 10 -phenanthroline, B=ethylenediamine (en), trimethylenediamine (tn), or butanediamine (bn)) in acetonitrile solution was studied using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The photochemical {{reaction of}} a diamineruthenium(II) complex {{has been known to}} proceed by oxidation of a diamine ligand to an α,α′-diimine by oxidative dehydrogenation. The final reaction product was a solvent substituted complex [Ru(phen) 2 S 2] 2 +, where S is the solvent acetonitrile. We detected two monodentate complexes, an imine complex [Ru(phen) 2 (B- 2) S] 2 + and a nitroso complex [Ru(phen) 2 (en+ 14) S] 2 + in the ESI-MS analysis of the photoreaction products of [Ru(phen) 2 B] 2 +. These monodentate complexes were not observed with a bipyridine complex [Ru(bpy) 2 B] 2 + (where bpy= 2, 2 ′-bipyridine, B=en or tn). In addition, photochemical reactivity of the phen complex was found to be higher than that of the bpy complex. The difference in the photochemical reactivity {{can be explained by the}} difference in configurational flexibility of the phen and bpy ligands in the ruthenium complexes...|$|R
