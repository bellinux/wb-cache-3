A system of cooperative wells is proposed to supplement surface water sources {{to meet the demand}} during the non-monsoon season, without inducing excessive saltwater intrusion.

The management models are solved by interfacing simulated annealing (SA) algorithm with an existing SHARP interface flow model to determine an optimal policy for location and <b>pumpages</b> of cooperative wells.

40|$|MODRSP is program {{used for}} calculating drawdown, velocity, storage losses and capture {{response}} functions for multi - aquifer ground -water flow systems. Capture {{is defined as}} the sum of the increase in aquifer recharge and decrease in aquifer discharge {{as a result of an}} applied stress from pumping [Bredehoeft et al., 19821. The capture phenomena treated by MODRSP are stream- aquifer leakance, reduction of evapotranspiration losses, leakance from adjacent aquifers, flows to and from prescribed head boundaries and increases or decreases in natural recharge or discharge from head dependent boundaries. The response functions are independent of the magnitude of the stresses and are dependent on the type of partial differential equation, the boundary and initial conditions and the parameters thereof, and the spatial and temporal location of stresses. The aquifers modeled may have irregular -shaped areal boundaries and non -homogeneous transmissive and storage qualities. For regional aquifers, the stresses are generally <b>pumpages</b> from wells. The utility of response functions arises from their capacity to be embedded in management models. The management models consist of a mathematical expression of a criterion to measure preference, and sets of constraints which act to limit the preferred actions. The response functions are incorporated into constraints that couple the hydrologic system with the management system (Maddock, 1972). MODRSP is a modification of MODFLOW (McDonald and Harbaugh, 1984, 1988). MODRSP uses many of the data input structures of MODFLOW, but there are major differences between the two programs. The differences are discussed in Chapters 4 and 5. An abbreviated theoretical development is presented in Chapter 2, a more complete theoretical development may be found in Maddock and Lacher (1991). The finite difference technique discussion presented in Chapter 3 is a synopsis of that covered more completely in McDonald and Harbaugh (1988). Subprogram organization is presented in Chapter 4 with the data requirements explained in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 contains three example applications of MODRSP...|$|R

50|$|We {{typically}} {{think of}} a cone of depression as being a circular feature surrounding the pumped well. However, aquifer characteristics can affect {{the shape of the}} cone of depression. For example, if there is a steep ground-water gradient in the area of <b>pumpage,</b> the cone will tend to be shorter in the upgradient direction and elongated in the downgradient direction. This is because the water is already flowing towards the well from the upgradient direction, so the cone of depression doesn’t need to extend as far out to obtain water, whereas the water is flowing away from the well in the downgradient direction, so the cone of depression needs to reach further to obtain water.|$|E

5000|$|However, {{it should}} be {{stressed}} that during this period Thornton Heath was still largely rural, and aside from the hamlet around the Pond, {{there was no indication}} it would develop into a residential suburb. Moreover, there was little distinction over boundaries. Thornton Heath was just the western edge of Croydon. Perhaps the most important contribution of the Local Board of Health was the implementation of systematic water supply, drainage and sewerage. [...] It was Edwin Chadwick, a leading government advisor on sanitation, who personally administered the rectification of the sanitation problem. Croydon subsequently became known as [...] "Chadwick's model". He oversaw {{the construction of a new}} pumping system and a sewerage farm. The water supply, which was thought to be disease-ridden as it was supplied from under ground, was temporarily replaced by a supply from the Lambeth Water Company. When the remedies had been completed it was hailed as a complete success: [...] "Drainage and <b>pumpage</b> combined with water works have almost banished typhus from towns like Croydon and reduced the death rate by a third." [...] Indeed, by 1867 the death rate had fallen to 16.6 per 1,000. However, a report into the cholera epidemic of 1866 revealed that water-borne disease was still claiming lives in Thornton Heath.|$|E
5000|$|Tulsa built a {{pumping plant}} in 1904 to deliver {{water from the}} Arkansas River to consumers. However, the source soon proved unsatisfactory, and {{unsuitable}} for domestic use. The water was high in silt, salt and gypsum. Wells also proved unsatisfactory because the water was either hard and salty or ran dry after a relatively short time.Spavinaw Dam, {{near the town of}} Spavinaw, Oklahoma and about 50 mi northeast of Tulsa, was completed in 1924. It created Lake Spavinaw, which was fed by Spavinaw Creek, a perennial stream that drained 400 sq mi of Ozark Mountain foothills. In 1922, a pipeline was begun to bring this water to Lake Yahola in Tulsa's Mohawk Park. On June 23, 1923, the Arkansas River flooded the city waterworks. The flood caused the city to relocate the waterworks to Mohawk Park. The line became operational in 1924, and was the longest such line in the U. S. at that time. Five years later, the city completed the Mohawk Water Treating Plant. This has been the principal source of Tulsa's domestic water since then. Tulsa completed a second pipeline in 1954, doubling the capacity. According to the City of Tulsa, the average monthly water <b>pumpage</b> rate in 2009 was [...] per day.

5000|$|Fertilizers and pesticides: Farmers use {{fertilizers}} and pesticides to promote growth and reduce insect damage. These products {{are also used}} on golf courses and suburban lawns and gardens. The chemicals in these products may end up in ground water. The extent of contamination depends on the types and amounts of chemicals used {{and how they are}} applied. Local environmental conditions (such as soil types, seasonal snow, and rainfall) also impact their contamination potential. Groundwater will normally look clear and clean because the ground naturally filters out particulate matter. But, natural and human-induced chemicals can be found in groundwater. As groundwater flows through the ground, metals such as iron and manganese are dissolved and may later be found in high concentrations in the water. Industrial discharges, urban activities, agriculture, groundwater <b>pumpage,</b> and disposal of waste all can affect groundwater quality. Contaminants can be human-induced, as from leaking fuel tanks or toxic chemical spills. Pesticides and fertilizers applied to lawns and crops can accumulate and migrate to the water table. Leakage from septic tanks and/or waste-disposal sites also can introduce bacteria to the water, and pesticides and fertilizers that seep into farmed soil can eventually end up in water drawn from a well. Or, a well might have been placed in land that was once used for something like a garbage or chemical dump site. Polluted runoff is created by rainfall or snow-melt moving over and through the ground. As the runoff moves, it picks up and carries away natural and human-made pollutants, finally depositing them into watersheds via lakes, rivers, wetlands, coastal waters, and even our underground sources of drinking water. In 2002, in the National Water Quality Inventory report to U.S. Congress, the states reported that agricultural non-point source (NPS) pollution {{is the leading cause of}} river and stream impairment and the second leading cause of impairment in lakes, ponds, and reservoirs.|$|E
40|$|Mr. Jones {{requested}} a Groundwater Availability Model (GAM) run using the GAM for the Igneous {{and parts of}} the West Texas Bolsons aquifers. Mr. Jones requested that we evaluate the impact of <b>pumpage</b> on water levels in the West Texas Bolsons aquifer. METHODS: To determine the impacts of pumping on water levels in the Culberson County GCD, we used the GAM for the Igneous {{and parts of the}} West Texas Bolsons aquifers and increased <b>pumpage</b> to the West Texas Bolsons aquifer incrementally, essentially providing a “sensitivity analysis ” of water levels to <b>pumpage.</b> The portions of the West Texas Bolsons aquifer included the GAM are Wildhorse Flat, Michigan Flat, Ryan Flat, and Lobo Flat and are locally referred to as being part of the Salt Basin Bolson aquifer. To avoid confusion with other parts of the West Texas Bolsons aquifer, we refer to the West Texas Bolsons aquifer in this GAM as the Salt Basin Bolson aquifer in this report. The baseline <b>pumpage</b> that we used in the predictive runs was the year 2000 estimated historic <b>pumpage</b> from the transient calibration/verification run. This year was the last of the historic <b>pumpage</b> estimates and therefore was considered to be the most accurate recent <b>pumpage</b> estimate for the model area. The year 2000 baseline <b>pumpage</b> was repeated for each year in the predictive model runs. We added an additional zero to two acre-feet per acre per year in all of Culberson County to this baseline <b>pumpage</b> for our predictive model runs. It {{is important to note that}} many model cells in the Salt Basin Bolson aquifers contained significant <b>pumpage</b> in the 2000 historic <b>pumpage</b> estimate. When creating uniform <b>pumpage</b> rates for the predictive runs, we only changed the <b>pumpage</b> in a model cell if the existing <b>pumpage</b> was less than the desired uniform <b>pumpage</b> rate.

40|$|The chief {{sources of}} {{groundwater}} for the Texas Winter Garden are the Carrizo (Dimmit, Zavala, Frio, and LaSalle Counties) and Edwards (Uvalde County) Aquifers. The major user of groundwater {{in the region}} is irrigation. However, insufficient aquifer recharge relative to groundwater use has stimulated interest in alternatives to ease adjustments to diminished groundwater supplies. The impact on net revenue, groundwater utilization, and land use of new crops (guar, guayule, and short-season irrigated cotton), row damming, and conversion of range to cropland was evaluated using a regional linear programming model. Temporal analysis, 1981 - 2001, incorporated changes in groundwater availability, static groundwater levels, and corresponding fixed and variable costs. Introduction of guar and short-season irrigated cotton (base solution) was associated with increased groundwater <b>pumpage</b> from the Carrizo Aquifer, increased net revenue, and increased irrigated acreages. Edwards Aquifer <b>pumpage</b> remained constant at an upper limit. When guayule entered the base solution, net revenue rose by four million dollars and groundwater <b>pumpage</b> and irrigated acreages declined only in the Carrizo Aquifer. Land clearing without guayule added 17, 25. 2, and 26. 3 million dollars to net revenue for light; light and medium; and light, medium, and heavy brush clearing; respectively. Under light brush clearing about 480, 000 acres were added to cropland and groundwater <b>pumpage</b> remained steady. <b>Pumpage</b> increased under the other land clearing activities. Land clearing with guayule almost doubled net revenue compared to land clearing without guayule. Row damming was the most effective alternative in reducing dependence on groundwater. Row damming in dryland grain sorghum and dryland cotton decreased groundwater <b>pumpage</b> and increased net returns above the base by 6. 7 million dollars without land clearing and 18. 6, 30. 3, and 32. 9 million dollars with the respective land clearing alternatives. Carrizo Aquifer groundwater <b>pumpage</b> was significantly reduced {{in each of the four}} alternatives and Edwards <b>pumpage</b> was reduced in all but the heavy brush clearing alternative. Under temporal and static analysis for projected (forecast) groundwater <b>pumpage,</b> net revenue, groundwater <b>pumpage,</b> and irrigated acres exceeded those of solutions with restricted (forced conservation) groundwater.

40|$|Conventional {{irrigation}} schedules {{are typically}} based on {{portions of the}} field where root zones hold the least available soil water. This leaves undepleted available water in areas with larger water holding capacities. The undepleted water could be used through variable-rate irrigation (VRI) management; however, the benefits of VRI without in-field mapping are unexamined. In this research, the field-averaged amount of undepleted available soil water in the root zone was calculated from the NRCS Soil Survey Geographic database for 49, 224 center-pivot irrigated fields in Nebraska. Potential reductions in <b>pumpage</b> from mining undepleted available water were then estimated. Results of the analysis show that widespread adoption of zone control VRI technology based only on the pumping savings from mining undepleted available water may be unwarranted for current VRI costs and average pumping energy expenses in the Central Plains ($ 0. 0026 m- 3 to $ 0. 0947 m- 3). <b>Pumpage</b> reductions exceeded 51 mm year- 1 for only 2 % of the fields and exceeded 25 mm year- 1 for 13 % of the fields; thus, reductions may be small compared to annual <b>pumpage</b> requirements. If VRI were im-plemented on all fields with a potential <b>pumpage</b> reduction greater than 51 or 25 mm year- 1, the volume of <b>pumpage</b> reduction would be approximately 0. 35 % or 1. 3 %, respectively, of the total irrigation <b>pumpage</b> in Nebraska. These data may be a conservative estimate of <b>pumpage</b> reduction in fields where the measured variability in soil properties exceeds that described by the NRCS Soil Survey, or if undepleted water is mined {{early in the season}} and the soil water profile is refilled by precipitation, allowing undepleted water to be mined again. Adoption of zone control VRI is most feasible for fields where the <b>pumpage</b> reduction from VRI is large and pumping costs are above normal. Pivot fields with high un-depleted water were sparsely distributed across Nebraska and were often located along streams and or in associated alluvial areas. The prevalence of fields with large quantities of undepleted water differed among and within soil associations. We were unable to assign feasibility of VRI based on the soil association, as the occurrence of undepleted water varied significantly within a soil association. These findings should assist producers and other entities interested in VRI technology; however, <b>pumpage</b> reduction through use of undepleted soil water is only one benefit of VRI technology and management. Producers are encouraged to consider all potential benefits when analyzing VRI investments...|$|E
40|$|We ran the {{groundwater}} availability {{model for the}} Hill Country portion of the Trinity Aquifer using average recharge rates with a specified annual baseline <b>pumpage</b> for a 60 -year predictive simulation. Model run results indicate up to 10 foot water level recovery {{over most of the}} Edwards Group and up to 3 feet water level decline where the aquifer is thin. We adjusted <b>pumpage</b> to try to achieve an average 15 foot water level decline across Groundwater Management Area 9 over the 60 -year predictive simulation for the Middle Trinity Aquifer. We were able to adjust <b>pumpage</b> to produce about a 13 foot average water level decline in the Middle Trinity Aquifer (the most widely used aquifer in the area) across Groundwater Management Area 9. The results of this model run indicate that achieving an average 13 foot water level decline results in a slight reduction in baseflow to the local rivers, springs, and lakes/reservoirs. Larger water level declines in the Upper and Middle Trinity aquifers occur in the northern parts of Bexar and western parts of Kerr counties. Comparison of baseline <b>pumpage</b> and adjusted <b>pumpage</b> for an average of 13 feet of water level decline shows that an additional 1, 540 acre-feet of groundwater could potentially be pumped regionally across most of Groundwater Management Area 9. In other words, <b>pumpage</b> that is close to current annual pumping volumes, as described by the districts in the baseline run, may produce an average of 13 feet of water level decline if pumping is continued at the same level through 2060 assuming average recharge conditions.

40|$|We ran the {{groundwater}} availability {{model for the}} Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) Aquifer for a 71 -year simulation, which consisted of 20 years (1980 - 1999) of historic conditions followed by a 51 -year (2000 - 2050) predictive time period. Average recharge conditions {{were used for the}} entire 51 years of the predictive portion of the simulation. The <b>pumpage</b> used in this simulation was based on {{the groundwater}} availability estimates from the 2007 State Water Plan and baseline <b>pumpage</b> discussed in GAM Run 07 - 03 (Donnelly, 2007). Results of this model run indicate that water-level declines after 51 years range from 50 feet to 100 feet for most counties in the model area. This mainly resulted from the increase in <b>pumpage</b> from the baseline <b>pumpage</b> that was approved by the Groundwater Management Area 7 and used in the previous GAM Run 07 - 03 (Donnelly, 2007). Extreme drawdowns (up to 600 feet) in Pecos, Glasscock, and Reagan counties in the Trinity part of the Edwards-Trinity (Plateau) Aquifer were predicted by the model at the end of 51 years, but research into the model performance during the calibration time period indicates that the model is not appropriately simulating the response of the Trinity Aquifer to <b>pumpage</b> in these areas (Donnelly, 2007). It is recommended that this model not be used to evaluate groundwater conditions in Pecos, Glasscock, and Reagan counties.

40|$|Abstract: This report {{discusses}} ground-water {{levels and}} <b>pumpage</b> in the Metro-East area {{just south of}} Alton, Illinois, to Dupo, Illinois, and between the Mississippi River and the river bluffs from 1986 - 1990. Large quantities of ground water, primarily for industrial and municipal use, are withdrawn from wells penetrating a sand-and-gravel aquifer along the valley lowlands of the Mississippi River. Ground-water <b>pumpage</b> declined from 62. 8 million gallons per day (mgd) in 1986 to 58. 7 mgd in 1990. Of the total 1990 <b>pumpage,</b> 76. 2 percent (or 44. 7 mgd) was industrial; 20. 8 percent (or 12. 2 mgd) was for public water supplies; 2. 0 percent (or 1. 2 mgd) was for irrigation; and 1. 0 percent (or 0. 6 mgd) was for domestic use. <b>Pumpage</b> in the Metro-East area is concentrated at five major pumping centers (Alton, Wood River, Roxana, National City, and Granite City) and four minor pumping centers (Poag, Glen Carbon, Collinsville, and Venice). <b>Pumpage</b> in the Sauget (Monsanto) area, once considered a minor pumping center (Kohlhase, 1987), was negli-gible in 1990 because of declining industrial use. Ground-water levels throughout the entire area were stable but elevated during 1986 and 1987. Water levels declined from 1988 to 1989 and increased in 1990. Factors contributing to this pattern were above-normal precipitation, the Midwestern drought of 1988 - 1989, changes in river stages, and the response of water levels t...|$|E
40|$|We ran the {{groundwater}} availability model (GAM) {{for the southern}} part of the Queen City and Sparta aquifers, which includes the Carrizo-Wilcox Aquifer, using 1999 estimated <b>pumpage</b> annually for a 60 -year predictive simulation along with average recharge, evapotranspiration rates, and initial streamflows. These model runs indicate that maintaining 1999 <b>pumpage</b> in the GAM results in the following: • maximum water level declines of less than 40 feet in the Sparta and Queen City aquifers, with some areas of recovery (increase in water levels); • maximum water level declines of 130 feet in the Carrizo Aquifer, centering around northern Frio County; and • water level declines of more than 80 feet in all three zones of the Wilcox Aquifer, also centering on northern Frio County and apparently caused by <b>pumpage</b> in the overlying Carrizo Aquifer.

40|$|Four {{parameters}} {{were examined}} to detect changes in ground-water {{quality in the}} Hueco bolson near El Paso, Texas. Sulfate (SO 4), chloride (CL), nitrate (NO 3), total dissolved solids (TDS) and <b>pumpage</b> data from 148 wells from 1970 through 1985 {{were used in the}} investigation. Regression analyses and contouring were used to determine if changes occurred with time, <b>pumpage,</b> depth or space. Results from the statistical tests indicate CL and TDS increase with time and average values of CL, NO 3 and TDS increase with total <b>pumpage.</b> Contour maps of the 4 constituents for the years 1970, 1975, 1980 and 1985 show a spatial increase in concentration. Contour maps of the regression coefficients pinpoint areas where the concentrations of the parameters are increasing with time. Degradation of the water quality appears to be due to several sources: urban runoff; leakage of saline water; lateral intrusion of saline water; and industrial pollution...|$|E
