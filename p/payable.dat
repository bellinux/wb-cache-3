40|$|Working capital {{management}} assists a firm in achieving improved liquidity through {{management of the}} components of receivables, inventory and <b>payables.</b> Previous studies have established that working capital has a strong positive correlation to profitability. These studies have also shown that the components of receivables and inventory have a positive correlation to profitability, while <b>payables</b> have an inverse relationship. The inverse correlation of <b>payables</b> in relation to profitability is contrary to the theory that advocates extending payables’ payment terms as a means of managing working capital and improving liquidity. This study attempted to ascertain whether, by applying a style-based test, to an extensive database of Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) listed South African companies, there is evidence to support a positive relationship between returns to investors and <b>payables</b> days. The study further applied the style-based test to the relationship between returns to investors and the management of <b>payables</b> in the form of change in <b>payables</b> days. Further data stratification was applied to industries that are more significantly invested in <b>payables</b> as well as to companies of increasing or decreasing momentum to differentiate the <b>payables</b> strategy of an increasingly profitable company versus an increasingly unprofitable company. The results of the study indicated that for those companies in industries that have significant investment in <b>payables,</b> management of their <b>payables</b> will achieve superior returns. The study also revealed that this relationship is significant for companies in the top 40 % momentum return and that higher change in <b>payables</b> could be applied as a means of obtaining a competitive edge.

40|$|Regarding {{the proper}} company management, <b>payables</b> {{are one of}} the {{important}} fields, which must be dealt with and which is important to optimise. The B. A. thesis is divided into two main parts, theoretical and practical. The practical one was produced in a particular company, which concentrates on production and distribution of building materials for both Czech and international market. Firstly, I analysed the <b>payables</b> of the company and then I examined the <b>payables</b> using the financial analysis. The analysis of the <b>payables</b> shows that the company has managed to reduce its overdue <b>payables</b> in the past three years, and that it has improved its liquidity in this way. Along with reducing the overdue <b>payables,</b> it is important to reduce also such receivables. However, the company is not very successful in doing it. Therefore, I suggest that the company should apply all and any legal instruments and secure its receivables by means of security tools to achieve reduction of the overdue receivables. As a result, the company will receive the financial means in time, which will be used to settle its <b>payables.</b> This creates good reputation in the market. The good reputation among business partners, authorities and the public guarantees long-term development of a company and its position in the market. Such a company can plan in the long term and develop its activity in the field, which it concentrates on...|$|R
