25|$|To conclude, {{the above}} {{limitations}} help to clearly outline its parameters. This essay has defined {{with the use}} of cases to demonstrate the successful attempts to depart from the traditional approach set by the Hughes and the High Trees cases. The parameters of this doctrine seem presently not to be clearly defined. These consequences have caused the parameters of <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> to be no longer an established and well-settled area, which may interpret a huge problem to the development of contract law. The threats to the limitations of <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel,</b> manifested from the continuing evolution of <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel,</b> may pose turbulence in contract law and open the flood gate to litigation. Therefore, the application of the modern <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> replaces the traditionally limitations set in the landmark cases. This equitable doctrine which originally acts as an exception to the doctrine of accord and satisfaction with subject to limitations now appears as an open and unlimited doctrine.|$|E
25|$|The {{proof of}} {{possible}} detriment or prejudice, which will appear if the promisor {{is allowed to}} revert to his original promise, is required. In Ajayi V. Briscoe (1964) 1 WLR 1326 or where he alters his position {{as a result of}} relying on that promise when though he suffers no detriment. In Alan Co. Ltd V El Nasr & Import Co. (1972) 2 QB 18, Denning detained that detriment is not an essential element of <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel.</b> Therefore, for a plea of <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> to succeed, there must be a change in circumstances of the promisee. This elementary composition of <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> has been the core and central topic of discussion {{in the evolution of the}} doctrine.|$|E
25|$|The {{promises}} {{within a}} contract will be enforced under the <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> doctrine, when enforcing the contract promises avoids injustice.|$|E
25|$|As noted above, under English law, <b>promissory</b> and {{proprietary}} <b>estoppel</b> {{are both}} species of equitable estoppel.|$|R
5000|$|Under English and Australian legal systems, estoppels {{in equity}} include <b>promissory</b> and {{proprietary}} <b>estoppels,</b> described below. (Contrast with estoppel by representation, {{which is a}} claim (under the English system) at law.) ...|$|R
25|$|The {{doctrine}} of <b>Promissory</b> <b>Estoppel</b> was first developed in Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co but was lost {{for some time}} until it was resurrected by Lord Denning in the leading case of Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, persons under 18 are {{typically}} minor and their contracts are considered voidable; however, if the minor voids the contract, benefits {{received by the}} minor must be returned. The minor can enforce breaches of contract by an adult while the adult's enforcement may be more limited under the bargain principle. <b>Promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> or unjust enrichment may be available, but generally are not.|$|E
25|$|<b>Promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> is not {{available}} when one party promises to accept a lesser sum in full payment of a debt, unless the debtor offers payment at an earlier date than was previously agreed. This is the rule formulated in Pinnel's Case, and affirmed in Foakes v Beer. This rule has, however, been thrown into doubt by the recent decision of Collier v Wright Ltd.|$|E
25|$|Note that <b>Promissory</b> <b>Estoppel</b> {{should not}} be {{confused}} with Estoppel for Non-disclosure of Knowledge, colloquially known as 'Nolissory Estoppel'. This arises when a party to a contract indicates that they have some knowledge about the value or the potential success/failure of a contract to the other party, but refuses to share this knowledge or 'nol'. The party with the 'nol' is estopped from their non-disclosure, and is forced to impart it equitably.|$|E
25|$|<b>Promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> is the {{doctrine}} that prevents a party from {{acting in a}} certain way because the first party promised not to, and the second party relied on that promise and acted upon it. In English law, a promise made without consideration is generally not enforceable, and is known as a gratuitous promise. For example, a car salesman promises not to sell a car over the weekend, but does so, the promise cannot be enforced. If however, the car salesman accepts one penny in consideration for the promise, the promise is binding and enforceable in court. Estoppel is one of the exceptions to this rule.|$|E
500|$|In 1947 {{he decided}} in Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd [...] KB 130 (known as the 'High Trees' case), {{which was a}} {{milestone}} in English contract law. It resurrected the principle of <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> established in Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co (1876–77) LR 2 App Cas 439 and has been both praised and criticised by lawyers and legal theorists.|$|E
500|$|In 1951 {{he gave a}} noted dissenting {{judgment}} in the case Candler v Crane, Christmas & Co regarded as a 'brilliant advancement {{to the law of}} negligent misstatements' and which was later approved of by the House of Lords in Hedley Byrne v Heller & Partners Ltd [...] 2 All ER 575. In Combe v Combe in 1952 he elaborated on his resurrected doctrine of <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel,</b> saying that it could be a 'shield' not a 'sword'; it could be used to defend a claim, but not to create a cause of action where none existed. In 1954 his decision in Roe v Minister of Health [...] 2 AER 131 altered the grounds on which hospital staff could be found negligent, a legal precedent he himself had set in Gold v Essex County Council in 1942. In 1955 his leading {{judgment in}} Entores Ltd v Miles Far East Corporation [...] 2 QB 327 implemented a way to judge the moment of acceptance in an instantaneous or near-instantaneous method of communication; like the 'High Trees' case it is still valid.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> is a {{term used}} in {{contract}} law that applies where there may not otherwise be an enforceable contract. [...] The importance of <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> in contract law {{is that it has}} enabled legal obligations, which fall into the category of contract law but fail to show any consideration, to be argued for. <b>Promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> provides a way in which promises can be legally binding even if no consideration has been given. <b>Promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> relates to a form of future conduct. The doctrine of <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> may not make the total contract fully enforceable. The specific facts in the case must actually establish the elements of <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> before the contract becomes enforceable in law.|$|E
2500|$|The {{full force}} {{application}} of the equitable maxim estoppel only allows a litigant to “use it as a shield {{and not as a}} sword” restricts the application of this doctrine to as far as only to provide a defence to a party and not {{to be used as a}} cause of action against another. In Combe v Combe [...] 2 KB 215, CA a husband promised to make maintenance payments to his separated wife but failed to do so. The wife brought an action to enforce the promise invoking <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel.</b> The court held that <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> does not create a cause of action and as such the requirement of consideration in formation of contract is still relevant. <b>Promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> is a rule of evidence that prevents the promisor from denying the truth of statement which the promisee had relied. Denning LJ said: [...] "The principle does not create new causes of action where none existed before. It only prevents a party from insisting on his strict legal rights when it would be unjust to allow him to enforce them". However, this requirement seemed changed in light of the decisions in Evenden v Guildford City AFC [...] QB 917, here the courts held [...] "that <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> can be a cause of action." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{doctrine}} {{does not}} operate to completely extinguish the original {{rights of the}} parties accruing from the contract. It only provides for the suspension of such right, which can subsequently be revived after certain event or time. In Tool Metal Manufacturing v Tungsten [...] 1 WLR 761 HL, The courts held that generally <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> will merely suspend legal rights rather than extinguish them. However, where periodic payments are involved and a promise {{has been made to}} reduce the payments because of pressing circumstances which are not likely to persist, <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> can be used to extinguish legal rights. This final limitation to the scope of estoppel operates {{in the sense that the}} doctrine applies to representations relating to past and present events only by excluding the future events executory promise. However, <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> may permanently extinguish the rights of the promisor to claim lump sum after part-payment. In D & C Builders v Rees [...] 2 QB 617, Lord Denning expressed that the: ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2008 the House of Lords re-visited the {{doctrine}} of proprietary estoppel, {{and in the process}} was quite fierce in describing its limits. [...] In that light, it must be very doubtful that Mr Jennings would have got the result he did: properly understood, Jennings v Rice {{is a bit of a}} muddle, probably concerning <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel,</b> with a bit of quantum meruit thrown in for good measure.|$|E
2500|$|Under English law, {{estoppel}} by, <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> and {{proprietary estoppel}} {{are regarded as}} reliance-based estoppels by Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol 16(2), 2003. [...] Both Halsbury's and Spencer Bower (see below) describe all three estoppels collectively as estoppels by representation. [...] These estoppels can be invoked when a promisee/representee wishes to enforce a promise/representation when no consideration was provided by him. [...] The court will only enforce this lack-of-consideration promise {{if and only if}} it would be [...] "unconscionable" [...] for the promisor/representor to rescind from his promise/representation ("it's not fair!"). [...] Estoppel when invoked in such a manner is often considered a rival or alternative to the doctrine of consideration under contract law. [...] Only proprietary estoppel can create a cause of action in English law, though the other two can act in support of a cause of action or a reply to a defence. [...] Under American jurisprudence, equitable estoppel is available only as a defense, while <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> can be used as the basis of a cause of action.|$|E
2500|$|Estoppel by {{representation}} of fact and <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> are mutually exclusive: [...] the former is based on {{representation of}} existing fact (or of mixed fact and law), while the latter {{is based on a}} promise not to enforce some pre-existing right (i.e., an intention as to the future). [...] Proprietary estoppel can operate only between parties who, at the time of representation, were in a pre-existing relationship, while this is not a pre-requisite under estoppel by {{representation of fact}}.|$|E
2500|$|It remains {{unsettled}} whether <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> {{may arise}} in pre-contractual relationships. In the case Brikom Investments Ltd v Carr [...] 2 All ER 753 CA, a landlord made an oral promise to his tenants {{that if they}} bought a 99 year lease to their flats he would repair the roofs of the flats at his own expense. After the leases had been signed by the tenants, the landlord repaired the roof {{at a cost of}} £15,000. The landlord then claimed a contribution from the tenants towards the cost of the repairs. The tenants refused to pay because of the promise made. The landlord claimed that Carr could not rely on her promise since she had not acted on his promise because she would have entered into the lease without any such promise having been made. However, Lord Denning was of the view that <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> may arise from promise made by parties negotiating contracts. Similar views was expressed in Durham Fancy Goods v Michael Jackson [...] 2 QB 839, [...] where Donaldson J. held that contractual relationship is irrelevant provided that there is “a pre-existing legal relationship which could, in certain circumstances, give rise to liabilities and penalties”.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, {{courts have}} upheld {{the rights of}} {{trademark}} owners with regard to commercial use of domain names, even in cases where goods sold there legitimately bear the mark. In the landmark decision Creative Gifts, Inc. v. UFO, 235 F.3d 540 (10th Cir. 2000) (New Mexico), defendants had registered the domain name [...] "Levitron.com" [...] to sell goods bearing the trademark [...] "Levitron" [...] under an at-will license from the trademark owner. The 10th Circuit affirmed {{the rights of the}} trademark owner with regard to said domain name, despite arguments of <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Estoppel by {{convention}} as {{understood in}} English law (also known as estoppel by agreement) occurs where two parties negotiates or operates a contract {{based on a}} shared assumption or mutual understanding of a legal effect (or interpretation) of that contract, they are bound by that belief, assumption or understanding if (i) they both knew the other operated under the same, and (ii) they both regulated their subsequent dealings on the same. [...] It {{has been said that}} estoppel by convention is not truly an estoppel but merely an instance of estoppel by representation, <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> or proprietary estoppel, though the first of the three is its most frequent manifestation.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> {{requires}} (1) an unequivocal promise by {{words or}} conduct, (2) {{a change in}} position of the promisee {{as a result of}} the promise (not necessarily to their detriment), (3) inequity if the promisor were to go back on the promise. Estoppel is [...] "a shield not a sword" [...] – it cannot be used as the basis of an action on its own. It also does not extinguish rights. In High Trees the plaintiff company was able to restore payment of full rent (although estopped back rent was lost) from early 1945, but would have been able to restore full rent at any time after the initial promise provided a suitable period of notice had been given.|$|E
2500|$|Lord Justice Denning is {{a leading}} figure {{in the field of}} <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> in the case of Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd [...] KB 130 (the High Trees case), was {{concerned}} with the modification of the rent payable on a block of flats during the Second World War. The importance of the case, however, lies in an obiter statement of principle which Denning LJ set out, “a promise intended to be binding, intended to be acted on, and in fact acted on, is binding so far as its terms properly apply”. Applying this principle, Denning held that a promise to accept a lower rent during the war years was binding on the landlord, regardless {{of the fact that the}} tenant had supplied no consideration for it.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{consideration}} is a doctrine deriving {{from the common}} law, and can be suspended under the principles of equity. Historically, England had two separate court systems, and the Courts of Chancery which derived their ultimate authority from the King via the Lord Chancellor, took precedence over the common law courts. So does its body of equitable principles since the systems were merged in 1875. The doctrine of <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> holds that when one person gives an assurance to another, the other relies on it {{and it would be}} inequitable to go back on the assurance, that person will be estopped from doing so: an analogue of the maxim that nobody should profit from their own wrong (nemo auditur propriam turpitudinem allegans). So in Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co the House of Lords held that a tenant could not be ejected by the landlord for failing to keep up with his contractual repair duties because starting negotiations to sell the property gave the tacit assurance that the repair duties were suspended. And in Central London Properties Ltd v High Trees House Ltd Denning J held that a landlord would be estopped from claiming normal rent during the years of World War II because he had given an assurance that half rent could be paid till the war was done. The Court of Appeal went even further in a recent debt repayment case, Collier v P J Wright (Holdings) Ltd. Arden LJ argued that a partner who had been assured he was only liable to repay one third of the partnership's debts, rather than be jointly and severally liable for the whole, had relied on the assurance by making repayments, and it was inequitable for the finance company to later demand full repayment of the debt. Hence, <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> could circumvent the common law rule of Foakes. <b>Promissory</b> <b>estoppel,</b> however, has been thought to be incapable of raising an independent cause of action, so that one may only plead another party is estopped from enforcing their strict legal rights as a [...] "shield", but cannot bring a cause of action out of estoppel as a [...] "sword". In Australia, this rule was relaxed in Walton Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher, where Mr Maher was encouraged to believe he would have a contract to sell his land, and began knocking down his existing building before Walton Stores finally told him they did not wish to complete. Mr Maher got generous damages covering his loss (i.e. reliance damages, but seemingly damages for loss of expectations as if there were a contract). Yet, where an assurance concerns rights over property, a variant [...] "proprietary estoppel" [...] does allow a claimant to plead estoppel as a cause of action. So in Crabb v Arun District Council, Mr Crabbe was assured he would have the right to an access point to his land by Arun District Council, and relying on that he sold off half the property where the only existing access point was. The council was estopped from not doing what they said they would. Given the complex route of legal reasoning to reach simple solutions, it is unsurprising that a number of commentators, as well as the Principles of European Contract Law have called for simple abandonment of the doctrine of consideration, leaving the basic requirements of agreement and an intention to create legal relations. Such a move would also dispense with the need for the common law doctrine of privity.|$|E
2500|$|As {{opposed to}} tort and unjust enrichment, {{contract}} is typically {{viewed as the}} part of the law of obligations which deals with voluntary undertakings, and accordingly gives a high priority to ensuring that only bargains to which people have given their true consent will be enforced by the courts. While it is not always clear when people have truly agreed in a subjective sense, English law takes the view that when one person objectively manifests their consent to a bargain, they will be bound. However, not all agreements, even if they are relatively certain in subject matter, are considered enforceable. There is a rebuttable presumption that people do not wish to later have legal enforcement of agreements made socially or domestically. The general rule is that contracts require no prescribed form, such as being in writing, except where statute requires it, usually for large deals like the sale of land. In addition and in contrast to civil law systems, English common law carried a general requirement that all parties, in order to have standing to enforce an agreement, must have brought something of value, or [...] "consideration" [...] to the bargain. This old rule is full of exceptions, particularly where people wished to vary their agreements, through case law and the equitable doctrine of <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel.</b> Moreover, statutory reform in the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 allows third parties to enforce the benefit of an agreement that they had not necessarily paid for so long as the original parties to a contract consented to them being able to do so.|$|E
5000|$|Equitable {{estoppel}} {{is distinct}} from <b>promissory</b> <b>estoppel.</b> <b>Promissory</b> <b>estoppel</b> involves a clear and definite promise, while equitable estoppel involves only representations and inducements.
