5|$|NIF's laser uses {{a system}} of large flashtubes (like those in a {{photography}} flashlamp) to optically pump {{a large number of}} glass plates. Once the plates are flashed and have settled into a <b>population</b> <b>inversion,</b> a small signal from a separate laser is fed into the optical lines, stimulating the emission in the plates. The plates then dump their stored energy into the growing beam, amplifying it billions of times.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the masing molecule, {{there are}} a few {{requirements}} that must be met for a strong maser source to exist. One requirement is a radio continuum background source to provide the radiation amplified by the maser, as all maser transitions take place at radio wavelengths. The masing molecule must have a pumping mechanism to create the <b>population</b> <b>inversion,</b> and sufficient density and path length for significant amplification to take place. These combine to constrain when and where megamaser emission for a given molecule will take place. The specific conditions for each molecule known to produce megamasers are different, as exemplified by {{the fact that there is}} no known galaxy that hosts both of the two most common megamaser species, hydroxyl and water. As such, the different molecules with known megamasers will be addressed individually.|$|E
5|$|Water megamasers {{were the}} first type of megamaser discovered. The first water megamaser was found in 1979 in NGC 4945, a galaxy in the nearby Centaurus A/M83 Group. The first {{hydroxyl}} megamaser was found in 1982 in Arp 220, which is the nearest ultraluminous infrared galaxy to the Milky Way. All subsequent OH megamasers that have been discovered are also in luminous infrared galaxies, {{and there are a}} small number of OH kilomasers hosted in galaxies with lower infrared luminosities. Most luminous infrared galaxies have recently merged or interacted with another galaxy, and are undergoing a burst of star formation. Many of the characteristics of the emission in hydroxyl megamasers are distinct from that of hydroxyl masers within the Milky Way, including the amplification of background radiation and the ratio of hydroxyl lines at different frequencies. The <b>population</b> <b>inversion</b> in hydroxyl molecules is produced by far infrared radiation that results from absorption and re-emission of light from forming stars by surrounding interstellar dust. Zeeman splitting of hydroxyl megamaser lines may be used to measure magnetic fields in the masing regions, and this application represents the first detection of Zeeman splitting in a galaxy other than the Milky Way.|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} hydrodynamics code post-processed by {{an atomic}} collisional-radiative model {{is used to}} calculate <b>population</b> <b>inversions</b> which occur in lithium-like ions in recombining aluminium laser-produced plasmas. Time and spatial evolution of the 5 f- 3 d and 4 f- 3 d <b>population</b> <b>inversions</b> in Al 10 + are obtained. The investigation of these inversions according to a range of incident laser parameters emphasizes a set of optimal plasma values of electron density and temperature as well as relative abundance of He-like and Li-like ions. The laser flux density range required for the production of <b>population</b> <b>inversions</b> in Al 10 + is shown to be relatively moderate (about 5. 1012 W/cm 2). The role of the cooling of the plasma and of the "frozen ionization" is emphasized...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{measurements}} and theoretical calculations of the vibrational population distribution in nonequilibrium nozzle expansion flows of gas mixtures are reported. These studies were directed toward determining whether vibrational energy exchange pumping {{could lead to}} laser action on the vibrational bands of a diatomic molecule. Three different types of experiments were conducted. These showed (1) that vibrational energy was preferentially transferred from N 2 to CO in supersonic nozzle flows containing these gases; (2) that under some conditions this vibrational energy exchange pumping mechanism created <b>population</b> <b>inversions</b> in the vibrational levels of CO; and (3) that at large expansion ratios the magnitude of these <b>population</b> <b>inversions</b> was sufficient to sustain lasing in the nozzle. A theoretical model was developed to calculate vibrational state population distributions in gas dynamic expansions of a mixture of diatomic gases. Although only isothermal calculations have been completed, these data indicate that <b>population</b> <b>inversions</b> are predicted for conditions similar to those obtained in the nozzle expansion flows...|$|R
40|$|Description of a {{combined}} analytical and experimental investigation of rapidly expanded CO 2 laser mixtures. Study of the vibrational kinetics indicates that <b>population</b> <b>inversions</b> with high vibrational energy density {{can be produced}} at high pressures by utilizing low (starved) concentrations of CO 2. Scaling laws for predicting the gain of starved systems are developed. A description is given of gain measurements carried out using a CO 2 laser to probe the flow in a nozzle {{at the point where}} the Mach number is approximately four. <b>Population</b> <b>inversions</b> at static pressures as high as about 1 atm have been observed and found to be in reasonable agreement with predictions...|$|R
25|$|To {{create a}} <b>population</b> <b>inversion</b> under these conditions, it is {{necessary}} to selectively remove some atoms or molecules from the system based on differences in properties. For instance, in a hydrogen maser, the well-known 21cm wave transition in atomic hydrogen, where the lone electron flips its spin state from parallel to the nuclear spin to antiparallel, can be used to create a <b>population</b> <b>inversion</b> because the parallel state has a magnetic moment and the antiparallel state does not. A strong inhomogeneous magnetic field will separate out atoms in the higher energy state from a beam of mixed state atoms. The separated population represents a <b>population</b> <b>inversion</b> which can exhibit stimulated emissions.|$|E
25|$|N2/N1 > 1; In other words, a <b>population</b> <b>inversion</b> is {{required}} for laser operation.|$|E
25|$|As before, the {{presence}} of a fast, radiationless decay transition results in the population of the pump band being quickly depleted (N4 ≈ 0). In a four-level system, any atom in the lower laser level E2 is also quickly de-excited, leading to a negligible population in that state (N2 ≈ 0). This is important, since any appreciable population accumulating in level 3, the upper laser level, will form a <b>population</b> <b>inversion</b> with respect to level 2. That is, as long as N3 > 0, then N3 > N2, and a <b>population</b> <b>inversion</b> is achieved. Thus optical amplification, and laser operation, can take place at a frequency of ν32 (E3-E2 = hν32).|$|E
40|$|The {{propagation}} {{of a normal}} shock wave into the CO_ 2 -N_ 2 -He gas mixture seeded with solid particles is analyzed. The translation-vibration and vibration-vibration molecular energy exchange processes in the gas mixture {{are included in the}} analysis. The results indicate the creation of <b>population</b> <b>inversions</b> due to these processes in the relaxation region behind the shock wave for transitions at 50 and 22 μ m in CO_ 2 molecules. The presence of solid particles in the flow is found to be advantageous for observing the laser radiation behind the shock wave. Effects of the frozen shock Mach number, the particle size, the particle-to-gas mass loading ratio, and the laser gas mixture composition on the <b>population</b> <b>inversions</b> are discussed...|$|R

25|$|To {{understand}} the concept of a <b>population</b> <b>inversion,</b> it is necessary to understand some thermodynamics and the way that light interacts with matter. To do so, it is useful to consider a very simple assembly of atoms forming a laser medium.|$|E
25|$|In some media it is possible, by {{imposing}} an additional optical or microwave field, to use quantum coherence effects {{to reduce the}} likelihood of an excited-state to ground-state transition. This technique, known as lasing without inversion, allows optical amplification to take place without producing a <b>population</b> <b>inversion</b> between the two states.|$|E
25|$|We may {{calculate}} {{the ratio of}} the populations of the two states at room temperature (T≈300K) for an energy difference ΔE that corresponds to light of a frequency corresponding to visible light (ν≈5×1014Hz). In this case ΔE = E2 - E1 ≈ 2.07eV, and kT ≈ 0.026eV. Since E2 - E1 ≫ kT, it follows that the argument of the exponential in the equation above is a large negative number, and as such N2/N1 is vanishingly small; i.e., there are almost no atoms in the excited state. When in thermal equilibrium, then, it is seen that the lower energy state is more populated than the higher energy state, and this is the normal state of the system. As T increases, the number of electrons in the high-energy state (N2) increases, but N2 never exceeds N1 for a system at thermal equilibrium; rather, at infinite temperature, the populations N2 and N1 become equal. In other words, a <b>population</b> <b>inversion</b> (N2/N1 > 1) can never exist for a system at thermal equilibrium. To achieve <b>population</b> <b>inversion</b> therefore requires pushing the system into a non-equilibrated state.|$|E

40|$|We numerically {{investigate}} {{the possibilities of}} driving quantum algorithms with laser pulses in a register of ultracold NaCs polar molecules in a static electric field. We focuse on the possibilities of performing scalable logical operations by considering circuits that involve intermolecular gates (implemented on adjacent interacting molecules) to enable the transfer of information from one molecule to another during conditional laser-driven <b>population</b> <b>inversions.</b> We study the implementation of an arithmetic operation (the addition of 0 or 1 on a binary digit and a carry in) which requires <b>population</b> <b>inversions</b> only and the Deutsch-Josza algorithm which requires a control of the phases. Under typical experimental conditions, our simulations show that high fidelity logical operations involving several qubits can be performed in a time scale {{of a few hundred}} of microseconds, opening promising perspectives for the manipulation {{of a large number of}} qubits in these systems...|$|R

Gain coefficients between 1 and 5 per cm have been measured in the 60 A - 200 A wavelength range...|$|R
25|$|As {{described}} above, a <b>population</b> <b>inversion</b> {{is required}} for laser operation, but cannot be achieved in our theoretical group of atoms with two energy-levels {{when they are in}} thermal equilibrium. In fact, any method by which the atoms are directly and continuously excited from the ground state to the excited state (such as optical absorption) will eventually reach equilibrium with the de-exciting processes of spontaneous and stimulated emission. At best, an equal population of the two states, N1 = N2 = N/2, can be achieved, resulting in optical transparency but no net optical gain.|$|E
25|$|Because {{at least}} half the {{population}} of atoms must be excited from the ground state to obtain a <b>population</b> <b>inversion,</b> the laser medium must be very strongly pumped. This makes three-level lasers rather inefficient, despite being the first type of laser to be discovered (based on a ruby laser medium, by Theodore Maiman in 1960). A three-level system could also have a radiative transition between level 3 and 2, and a non-radiative transition between 2 and 1. In this case, the pumping requirements are weaker. In practice, most lasers are four-level lasers, described below.|$|E
25|$|Since {{only a few}} atoms must {{be excited}} into the upper laser level to form a <b>population</b> <b>inversion,</b> a four-level laser is much more {{efficient}} than a three-level one, and most practical lasers are of this type. In reality, many more than four energy levels {{may be involved in}} the laser process, with complex excitation and relaxation processes involved between these levels. In particular, the pump band may consist of several distinct energy levels, or a continuum of levels, which allow optical pumping of the medium over a wide range of wavelengths.|$|E
40|$|Here we use {{perturbation}} techniques {{based on}} the averaging method to investigate Rabi oscillations in cw and pulse-driven two-level systems (TLS's). By going beyond the rotating-wave approximation, especifically to second-order in perturbation, we obtain the Bloch-Siegert shift of the TLS resonant frequency, in which the resonant frequency increases with the driving field amplitude. This frequency shift implies that short resonant π-pulses in which the Rabi frequency is approximately 40 % or higher of the transition frequency do not achieve complete inversion in TLS's. Hence, guided by analytical results {{based on the}} averaging technique, we propose two methods for obtaining <b>population</b> <b>inversions</b> in the TLS driven by short π-pulses: one with chirping {{and the other with}} pulse shaping and near resonance blue-shifted detuning. Both methods minimize dephasing due to the Bloch-Siegert shift, reduce the dependance of the excitation of the TLS on the pulse phase, and are very effective in achieving complete <b>population</b> <b>inversions.</b> Comment: 27 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

25|$|The {{process is}} {{identical}} in form to atomic absorption {{in which the}} energy of an absorbed photon causes an identical but opposite atomic transition: from the lower level to a higher energy level. In normal media at thermal equilibrium, absorption exceeds stimulated emission because there are more electrons in the lower energy states than in the higher energy states. However, when a <b>population</b> <b>inversion</b> is present, the rate of stimulated emission exceeds that of absorption, and a net optical amplification can be achieved. Such a gain medium, along with an optical resonator, {{is at the heart}} of a laser or maser.|$|E
25|$|Prior to firing, the Nd:glass {{amplifiers}} {{are first}} pumped {{with a series}} of Xenon flash lamps surrounding them. Some of the light produced by the lamps is captured in the glass, leading to a <b>population</b> <b>inversion</b> that allows for amplification via stimulated emission. This process is quite inefficient, and only about 1 to 1.5% of the power fed into the lamps is actually turned into laser energy. In order to produce the sort of laser power required for Nova, the lamps had to be very large, fed power from a large bank of capacitors located under the laser bay. The flash also generates a large amount of heat which distorts the glass, requiring time for the lamps and glass to cool before they can be fired again. This limits Nova to about six firings a day at the maximum.|$|E
500|$|Masers and lasers {{built on}} Earth and masers {{that occur in}} space both require <b>population</b> <b>inversion</b> in order to operate, but the {{conditions}} under which <b>population</b> <b>inversion</b> occurs are very different in the two cases. Masers in laboratories have systems with high densities, which limits the transitions that may be used for masing, and requires using a resonant cavity in order to bounce light back and forth many times. Astrophysical masers are at low densities, and naturally have very long path lengths. At low densities, being out of thermal equilibrium is more easily achieved because thermal equilibrium is maintained by collisions, meaning <b>population</b> <b>inversion</b> can occur. Long path lengths provide photons traveling through the medium many opportunities to stimulate emission, and produce amplification of a background source of radiation. These factors accumulate to [...] "make interstellar space a natural environment for maser operation." [...] Astrophysical masers may be pumped either radiatively or collisionally. In radiative pumping, infrared photons with higher energies than the maser transition photons preferentially excite atoms and molecules to the upper state in the maser in order to produce <b>population</b> <b>inversion.</b> In collisional pumping, this <b>population</b> <b>inversion</b> is instead produced by collisions that excite molecules to energy levels above that of the upper maser level, and then the molecule decays to the upper maser level by emitting photons.|$|E

40|$|Two of {{the most}} {{promising}} classes of schemes for X-ray laser action are the recombination approach, in which <b>population</b> <b>inversions</b> are produced by the decay cascade following electron recombination into high-lying quantum states of a recombining ion, and the photo-pumping approach, in which <b>population</b> <b>inversions</b> are produced by direct pumping of the upper quantum state by photo-excitation from the ground state. In this paper, the recombination and photo-pumping approaches for producing x-ray lasing on the hydrogen-like Balmer alpha line are compared and the effects of the hydrogen-like fine structure on the plasma and other conditions required to achieve Balmer alpha gain are examined. For electron densities Ne ≤ 1012 Z 7 cm - 3 (where Z is the atomic number of the hydrogen-like ion), it is shown that Balmer alpha gain can be much more difficult to produce than is predicted by simple calculations assuming all sub-levels are populated statistically. It is shown, for example, that Balmer alpha gain produced by 1 s- 3 p photo-pumping becomes impossible for electron densities Ne ≤ 1010 Z 7 cm- 3 because the 2 s 1 / 2 sub-level becomes metastable...|$|R
500|$|The word maser {{derives from}} the acronym MASER, which stands for [...] "Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation". The maser is a {{predecessor}} to lasers, which operate at optical wavelengths, and is named by the replacement of [...] "microwave" [...] with [...] "light". Given a system of atoms or molecules, each with different energy states, an atom or molecule may absorb a photon and move to a higher energy level, or the photon may stimulate emission of another photon of the same energy and cause a transition to a lower energy level. Producing a maser requires <b>population</b> <b>inversion,</b> which is when a system has more members in a higher energy level relative to a lower energy level. In such a situation, more photons will be produced by stimulated emission than will be absorbed. Such a system is not in thermal equilibrium, and as such requires special conditions to occur. Specifically, it must have some energy source that can pump the atoms or molecules to the excited state. Once <b>population</b> <b>inversion</b> occurs, a photon with a photon energy corresponding to the energy difference between two states can then produce stimulated emission of another photon of the same energy. The atom or molecule will drop to the lower energy level, {{and there will be}} two photons of the same energy, where before there was only one. The repetition of this process is what leads to amplification, and since all of the photons are the same energy, the light produced is monochromatic.|$|E
