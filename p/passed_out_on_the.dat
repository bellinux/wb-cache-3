25|$|From {{the second}} verse, Rihanna {{and her boyfriend}} are seen happily running amok in a supermarket, pushing {{each other in a}} {{shopping}} cart and spraying canned drinks at each other. This scene is interrupted with Rihanna in a Pontiac Trans Am outside with her boyfriend who begins to recklessly drive in circles, resulting in Rihanna asking him to stop the car which ensues into an argument between the pair. The video then progressively shows the couple experiencing mounting difficulties in their relationship. Rihanna removes herself from the car and returns moments later where we see her boyfriend grab her chin to look at him, suggesting that he is domestically violent towards her. During the final chorus Rihanna can be seen vomiting what appears to be pink and white streamers; she is also seen <b>passed</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> street while her boyfriend tries to revive her. In another scene, Rihanna is seen lying on a couch while her boyfriend tattoos the word 'MINE' on her backside. Eventually, Rihanna decides to leave her boyfriend after finding him <b>passed</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor of his apartment – and most likely due to the previous events shown throughout the video. The clip ends with Rihanna curled up in the corner of a room, crying.|$|E

[...] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Mikael Wood thought that the song confirmed the description of the album as [...] "a turn toward darkness from a singer who first topped the country chart with 'Jesus, Take the Wheel'." [...] USA Today columnist Brian Mansfield thought the song's [...] "synthesizers, strings sounds, vocal overdubs and echoing guitars" [...] combined dramatically, creating a [...] "neo-80s feel - think an Oklahoma version of the Eurythmics." [...] "Blown Away" [...] received a five-star rating from Billy Dukes of Taste of Country, who called it [...] "dangerous, but irresistible." [...] He also praised Underwood for recording darker material than her previous singles. Also giving it five stars, Bobby Peacock of Roughstock called it [...] "more grandiose" [...] than Underwood's previous efforts, also saying that it [...] "makes itself known by sounding like absolutely nothing else on radio."

At first, they built the drums and the string parts that of the introduction and verses. Tompkins started playing his keyboard to find sound effects for the introduction, and ended up using one that was a thunderstorm. [...] "I think that's what kind of threw us into it. We just started writing it," [...] he said. The songwriters then {{came up with the}} first verse of the song: [...] "Dry lighting cracks across the skies / Those storm clouds gather in her eyes / Her daddy was a mean old mister / Momma was an angel in the ground / The weatherman called for a twister / She prayed blow it down." [...] Kear commented that it was not the duo's intent or goal to make it a dark, revenge-themed song.

[...] "We knew if we stuck with that lyric [...] it was Carrie's song or maybe no one would ever record it," [...] Kear commented.
