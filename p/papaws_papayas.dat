Recent attempts at alternative {{crops such as}} tea trees, mangoes, sugar cane, coffee, lemons, limes, avocados, <b>papaws,</b> <b>papayas,</b> peanuts, soya beans, lychees, grapes and cash crops (pumpkins, melons, etc.) have met with mixed success. Farming is a significant employment option in Dimbulah and many travelers, including backpackers, are employed as short-term farm labourers, particularly during the busy mango harvest from November to January. Holders of a working holiday visa may be eligible for an extension to their visa {{after a period of}} work on farms in the area. Accommodation is available at the town's caravan park or the Junction Hotel. If employed on a farm, accommodation is often available in small 'dongas' or barracks. Public transport from Cairns is possible, although infrequent, on Trans North's bus service which stops at Mareeba, 45 km from Dimbulah. The Savannahlander tourist train stops in Dimbulah as well but does not operate year-round.|$|E
40|$|Tropical fruit growers {{are seeking}} to {{understand}} the values that underlie consumers' purchasing behaviours of <b>papaw</b> and <b>papaya</b> in Australia. Accordingly, studies that identify consumer preferences for <b>papaw</b> and <b>papaya</b> are needed to aid industry success. This study took an exploratory approach to profile urban Australian <b>papaw</b> and <b>papaya</b> buyers using a sample of 819 shoppers. The purpose was to identify buyer types and sociology-demographic variables influencing purchase frequency. The results revealed three buyer types: regular, occasional and irregular. Results showed that for both <b>papaw</b> and <b>papaya</b> purchasing frequency, regular and occasional buying habits decrease with age, and irregular buying habits increase with age. Overall, sensory studies are required to evaluate buyer taste preferences. Marketing communications highlighting the health and nutritional benefits of the fruit are recommended. Future research should focus on clearly understanding the buyer proposition for fresh and cut <b>papaw</b> and <b>papaya.</b> Griffith Business School, Department of International Business and Asian StudiesFull Tex...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects on}} <b>papaw</b> (Carica <b>papaya</b> L.) shoot {{growth of the}} {{carbohydrates}} sucrose, fructose, glucose and ribose singly and combined, were compared at a range of concentrations, in both autoclaved and filtered media. Fructose (10 g L- 1), when autoclaved together with other media components, consistently promoted growth of shoots from buds on nodal sections or buds excised with a wedge of stem tissue. This enhancement was seen if the fructose was used singly or in combination with 10 g L- 1 sucrose. By contrast, autoclaved media containing fructose reduced growth of small axillary bud explants. Decreasing the pH of fructose solution from 5. 8 to 4. 4 before autoclaving enhanced growth of buds from nodal sections. Other sugars in the D-ketose group inhibited papaw shoot growth totally when autoclaved with other media components. A radish cotyledon bioassay of solutions of fructose autoclaved singly or with NH 4 NO 3 (20 mM) showed no evidence of cytokinin effects...|$|R
30|$|In 1997, antocyanins {{extracted}} from blackberries gave a conversion efficiency of 0.56 % [268]. The roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa containing anthocyanin) flowers and <b>papaw</b> (Carica <b>papaya</b> containing chlorophyll) leaves {{were also investigated}} as natural sensitizers for DSSCs. Eli et al. sensitized TiO 2 photoelectrode with roselle extract (η[*]=[*] 0.046 %) and papaw leaves (η[*]=[*] 0.022 %), respectively and found better efficiency for roselle extract-sensitized cell because of the broader absorption of the roselle extract onto TiO 2 [278]. Tannins have also been attracted as a sensitizer in DSSCs due to their photochemical stability. DSSCs using natural dyes tannins and other polyphenols ({{extracted from}} Ceylon black tea) have given photocurrents of up to 8  mAcm−[*] 2 [168]. Haryanto et al. fabricated a DSSC using annato seeds (Bixa orellana Linn) as a sensitizer [279]. They demonstrated VOC and JSC for 30  g, 40  g, and 50  g as 0.4000  V, 0.4251  V, and 0.4502  V and 0.000074  A, 0.000458  A, and 0.000857  A, respectively. The efficiencies of the fabricated solar cells using annato seeds as a sensitizer for each varying mass were 0.00799 %, 0.01237 %, and 0.05696 %. They observed 328 – 515  nm wavelength range for annato seeds {{with the help of}} a UV-vis spectrometer. Hemalatha et al. reported a PCE of 0.22 % for the Kerria japonica carotenoid dye-sensitized solar cells in 2012 [280].|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Carica <b>papaya</b> (<b>papaw)</b> is {{the largest}} edible fruit of the family Caricacae. The fruit had been found to contain some {{important}} nutrients that the body need, hence, the fruit is used at homes and industrial work locations as food. In this research, the nutritional content of three different varieties of C. papaya (indigenous variety, solo kapoho and solo sunrise) at various ripening stages was investigated. The result revealed that the indigenous ripe variety contained the highest fat, protein and vitamin the values of 2. 94 %, 1. 65 % and 390. 33 mg/ml respectively while the unripe variety has the highest ash content with value of 9. 16 %. While solo kapoho ripe was highest in carbohydrate (79. 20 %), the semi ripe was the highest in crude fibre and vitamin A with values of 28. 38 % and 218. 96 IU respectively. Solo kapoho unripe was highest in acidity (0. 20 %). Solo sunrise ripe was highest in moisture content (24. 41 %). There is a significant (p < 0. 05) difference in the various parameters assayed among the various varieties. The results were discussed in respect to the nutritional statuses of the different varieties at various ripening stages...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of the Efficiency of Ethanolic Extracts of <b>Papaw</b> Seeds (Carica <b>papaya</b> L.) against Ascaridia galli Ascaridiasis in Broiler Chicken. A {{study was}} carried out to study the {{efficiency}} of ethanolic extracts of papaw seeds against Ascaridia galli ascaridiasis in broiler chicken. Fifty-four 7 days old ISA 15 VEDETTE broilers raised in the Practical Training and Research Farm of Dschang University in Cameroon were inoculated with 1 ml of suspension containing approximately 100 embryonated A. galli eggs per bird. The broilers, divided into 3 groups of 18 birds, after 47 days, received either 0 g/l, 1. 5 g/l and 3 g/l of ethanolic papaw seeds extracts administered one time only and corresponding to Do, D 3 / 2 and D 3 treatments. The reduction rates of number of eggs per gramme of faeces were 2. 4 %, 72. 7 %, 82. 1 % for treatment Do, D 3 / 2 and D 3 respectively. The reduction rates of parasitic load were 49 % and 76 % respectively for treatment D 3 / 2 and D 3 compared to parasitic load obtained from control Do at autopsy. Average weight gains a week after treatment was 108 g, 297 g and 400 g in Do, D 3 / 2 and D 3 treatment respectively. Ethanolic extracts of papaw seed appear to be efficient {{in the treatment of}} A. galli ascaridiasis at the doses of 1. 5 g/l and 3 g/l in broiler...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of the Efficiency of Aqueous Extracts of <b>Papaw</b> Seeds (Carica <b>papaya</b> L.) for the Treatment of Caecum Eimeria tenella Coccidiosis in Broiler Chicken. A {{study was}} carried out to study the {{efficiency}} of aqueous extracts of papaw seeds {{for the treatment of}} caecum Eimeria tenella coccidiosis in broiler chicken. Eighty eight 37 -day old caged ISA 15 VEDETTE broiler chickens were inoculated with a suspension of 3500 ± 1050 E. tenella oocysts/ml. The birds then divided into 4 groups of 22 birds received 10 days later either 0 (D 0 dose), 10 (D 10 dose), 20 (D 20 dose) or 40 g/l (D 40 dose) of aqueous extracts of papaw seeds. Mortality rates of 45. 5 %, 34. 8 %, 18. 2 % and 9. 1 % were recorded for D 0, D 10, D 20 and D 40 groups respectively. As compared to infestation rate before treatment, the reduction rate of the number of oocysts/g of faeces was respectively 6. 6 %, 42. 8 %, 73. 6 % and 91. 8 % for D 0, D 10, D 20 and D 40. Average daily weight gain was 42. 7 g, 47. 8 g, 69. 8 g and 86 g for treatments D 0, D 10, D 20 and D 40, respectively while average weekly feed efficiency ratio values of 3. 9, 4. 1, 2. 4 and 1. 9 were respectively recorded for D 0, D 10, D 20 and D 40 treatments. Aqueous extracts of papaw seeds seemed to be efficient in the treatment of caecum E. tenella coccidiosis in broiler chickens...|$|R
6000|$|So back to {{our little}} beach we went, and walked it all over again, finding, of course, many things which had escaped us the night before. We saw our first Melocactus, and our first night-blowing Cereus {{creeping}} over the rocks. We found our first tropic orchid, with white, lilac, and purple flowers on a stalk three feet high. [...] We saw our first wild pines (Tillandsias, etc.) clinging parasitic on the boughs of strange trees, or nestling among the angular limb- like shoots of the columnar Cereus. We learnt to distinguish the poisonous Manchineel; and were thankful, in serious earnest, that we had happily plucked none the night before, when we were snatching at every new leaf; for its milky juice, by mere dropping on the skin, burns like the poisoned tunic of Nessus, and will even, when the head is injured by it, cause blindness and death. We gathered a nosegay of the loveliest flowers, under a burning sun, within ten days of Christmas; and then wandered off the shore up a little path in the red lava, toward a farm where we expected to see fresh curiosities, and not in vain. On {{one side of the}} path a hedge of Pinguin (Bromelia)--the plants like huge pine-apple plants without the fruit--was but three feet high, but from its prickles utterly impenetrable to man or beast; and inside the hedge, a tree like a straggling pear, with huge green calabashes growing out of its bark- -here was actually Crescentia Cujete--the plaything of one's childhood--alive and growing. The other side was low scrub--prickly shrubs like acacias and mimosas, covered with a creeping vine with brilliant yellow hair (we had seen it already from the ship, gilding large patches of the slopes), most like European dodder. Among it rose the tall Calotropis procera, with its fleshy gray stems and leaves, and its azure of lovely lilac flowers, with curious columns of stamens in each--an Asclepiad introduced from the Old World, where it ranges from tropical Africa to Afghanistan; and so on, and so on, up to a little farmyard, very like a Highland one in most things, want of neatness included, save that huge spotted Trochi were scattered before the door, instead of buckies or periwinkles; {{and in the midst of}} the yard grew, side by side, the common accompaniment of a West India kitchen door, the magic trees, whose leaves rubbed on the toughest meat make it tender on the spot, and whose fruit makes the best of sauce or pickle to be eaten therewith- -namely, a male and female <b>Papaw</b> (Carica <b>Papaya),</b> their stems some fifteen feet high, with a flat crown of mallow-like leaves, just beneath which, in the male, grew clusters of fragrant flowerets, in the female, clusters of unripe fruit. On through the farmyard, picking fresh flowers at every step, and down to a shady cove (for the sun, even at eight o'clock in December, was becoming uncomfortably fierce), and again into the shore-grape wood. We had already discovered, to our pain, that almost everything in the bush had prickles, of all imaginable shapes and sizes; and now, touching a low tree, one of our party was seized as by a briar, through clothes and into skin, and, in escaping, found on the tree (Guilandina, Bonducella) rounded prickly pods, which, being opened, proved to contain the gray horse-nicker-beads of our childhood.|$|R
