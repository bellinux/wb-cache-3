The service, however, {{like most other}} convergence services of its kind, is facing an array of regulatory uncertainties. <b>Portable</b> <b>mobile</b> broadcasting service providers in Korea have been complaining about {{the absence of a}} stable regulatory framework, which, they say, interferes with their ability to deploy business.

40|$|Abstract—Portable mobile {{computing}} and communication applications demand low-power and low-energy with high performance. These competing demands drive SoC development. Especially, 3 D graphics-intensive applications are predicted to become widely {{available on a}} variety of <b>portable</b> <b>mobile</b> devices ranging from laptops to PDAs to mobile phones. Such 3 D graphics coprocessors were originally developed for home computers and game consoles, which use steady power supplies. But a <b>portable</b> <b>mobile</b> device has a limited battery life, which needs to be prolonged as much as possible. Consequently, low power design is the most important segment in order to become competitively <b>portable</b> <b>mobile</b> consumer electronics. We are developing a high-performance, low-power, 3 D-graphics SoC to meet such requirements.
