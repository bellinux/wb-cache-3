40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the effects from Directive 2009 / 49 /EC. This directive amend the Fourth and Seventh Company Directives, the Accounting Directives, regarding {{the information that}} Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SME) have to present in notes connected to both the annual reports and notes to the consolidated accounts, in situations with subsidiaries when its necessary to draw up consolidated accounts. The Accounting Directives does not affect all <b>companies,</b> almost only <b>private</b> <b>limited</b> <b>liability</b> <b>companies,</b> is this type of companies the only one discussed. Directive 2009 / 49 /EC is not affecting all sizes of <b>private</b> <b>limited</b> <b>liability</b> <b>companies</b> within the European Union, since {{the most important reason}} for implementing it is to give SMEs less administrative burden by lower requirements regarding the information presented in notes attached to the reports. The implementation of Directive 2009 / 49 EC is a positive change since it is in line with the idea of an Internal Market with equal rights and obligations to all sized of <b>limited</b> <b>liability</b> <b>companies,</b> <b>private</b> or public. The lower obligations in the annual reports in the Fourth Directive are for SMEs to the better because of the less administrative burden and the loss of information for interested is not more important, but of course, for some it is crucial. Amending the Seventh Directive may have larger effect to some companies, most likely medium-sized SMEs, since the obligation to draw consolidated accounts will for some companies not be necessary...|$|R

I take a social sciences approach to the legal question: How does the design of clauses establishing restrictions on transfer of shares of <b>private</b> <b>limited</b> <b>liability</b> <b>companies</b> affect investment made in these companies and their consequent development? To answer this question, I develop two parallel lines of investigation. First, I undertake an embedded historical study to trace the evolutionary patterns of PLLCs in six countries. Furthermore, I longitudinally track the standards of behavior of market agents in the selected jurisdictions. Second, I develop my legal research by looking at an anomaly regarding the transfer of shares and changes in the ownership structure of these business organizations. Transfer of shares in PLLCs is, for the most part, regulated by default rules which impose restrictions on transfers. Typically, the parties do not contract around these default rules. The anomaly lies in the fact that, even though shareholders of these companies do not opt out of these rules, shareholders often ignore them and/or breach them at a later stage...|$|R

40|$|We use {{the history}} of <b>private</b> <b>limited</b> <b>liability</b> <b>companies</b> (PLLCs) to {{challenge}} two pervasive assumptions in the literature: (1) Anglo-American legal institutions were better for economic development than continental Europe 2 ̆ 019 s civil-law institutions; and (2) the corporation was the superior form of business organization. Data on the number and types of firms organized in France, Germany, the UK, and the US show that that the PLLC became the form of choice for small- and medium-size enterprises wherever and whenever it was introduced. The PLLC's key advantage was its flexible internal governance rules that allowed its users to limit the threat of untimely dissolution inherent in partnerships without taking on the full danger of minority oppression that the corporation entailed. The PLLC was first successfully introduced in Germany, a code country, in 1892. Great Britain, a common-law country followed in 1907, and France, a code country, in 1925. The laggard was the US, a common-law country whose courts had effectively killed earlier attempts to enact the form...|$|R

40|$|In 2013, the Fourth and Seventh Directives were {{replaced}} by a new Accounting Directive – Directive 2013 / 34 /EC. The Directive is the outcome of EU aspirations to ease the business environment of {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} by simplifying the requirements with regard to reporting and mandatory disclosures for that category of enterprises. The entities of the practical sector (public and <b>private</b> <b>limited</b> <b>liability</b> <b>companies,</b> partnerships, general partnerships, etc.) come within the scope of the Directive. The scope of the Directive excludes non-profit legal entities. The provisions of the Directive should, for the first time, be applied with regard to financial statements for reporting years beginning on or after January 1, 2016. Being an EC Member State, the Republic of Bulgaria has to transpose the Directive into the national accounting legislation by July 2015. The emphasis in this article is put on the basic problematic areas which occur in the process of the transposition of the Directive. As the possible solutions are based on established traditions and practices, the authors of this article try to identify the solutions to these problems taking into consideration the requirements imposed by the Directive itself. Four principal prob-lems are defined in the article: should there be a new Accounting Law and what should it include; should the Accounting Law include accounting principles; what groups and categories of enterprises should be differentiated and which accounting basis should be applied by any of them...|$|R
40|$|In 2008, the European Commission {{proposed}} a regulation {{for a new}} European private company, called the Societas Privata Europeaea. This proposal did not get unanimous approval and was therefore withdrawn {{after five years of}} attempt to find a compromise. In 2014, the European Commission {{proposed a}} directive on single-member <b>private</b> <b>limited</b> <b>liability</b> <b>companies,</b> called the Societas Unius Personae. The aims of the new proposal have a few similarities as the European private company, as will be mentioned in the introduction. However, the proposed directive introduces a few changes, which the European Commission hopes will make this proposal successful. The purpose with this thesis is mainly to examine whether there is a need of a new European company form on the market today. The conclusion is taken by examining who would benefit the most with this company form. This thesis contains an explanation of the proposed directive, a comparison between this new company form and the corresponding Swedish company, as well as opinions on this directive. In the end there is a discussion regarding this subject and lastly my conclusions. The result has shown that there are still great amount of uncertainties that are in need of further discussion in order for this proposal to eventually pass unanimous consent. My conclusions are that there is not an urgent need of a new European company form on the market right now. However, it is a work in progress, and I believe a European company form like this one is a good way towards the aim of uniting the Member States of the European Union...|$|R
40|$|Danmarks Nationalbank {{introduced}} its annual report on financial stability in Denmark in 2000. The {{purpose of the}} analyses is to identify risks currently faced by the financial sector. As the stability in the financial sector depends on the customers' financial circumstances, and as the majority of lending from Danish banks is granted to companies in Denmark, analyses of the development in the non-financial sector are crucial in a financial stability context. The primary goal {{of this paper is}} to make a tool that can assist the regular analyses of the non-financial sector, namely to make a model that is able to predict the firms that end up in financial distress. As the firms in the non-financial sector may go out of business for various reasons (financial distress, voluntary liquidation, and because they are merged or acquired, etc.) the method of competing-risks models seems appropriate. To get point identification a parametric competing-risks model is suggested. The parametric competing-risks model is estimated and the results are reported. The empirical analysis is based on a panel data set containing information on the whole population of Danish non-financial public <b>limited</b> <b>liability</b> <b>companies</b> (aktieselskaber) and <b>private</b> <b>limited</b> <b>liability</b> <b>companies</b> (anpartsselskaber) that existed between 1995 and 2001, covering around 30, 000 firms and more than 150, 000 firm-year observations. After application of certain criteria (e. g. exclusion of holding companies and financial institutions), the sample is representative. More than 20 explanatory variables are included in the estimations. Compared to the existing literature this study introduces a number of novel elements to the empirical analysis. Firstly, the empirical distinction between three modes of exit is developed, namely between firms in financial distress, voluntarily liquidated firms, and firms that merge with other firms or are acquired by other firms, and a competing-risks model is estimated. Secondly, a large number of proxies are used for inherently unobservable variables (e. g. uncertainty, ability and motivation). As is discussed in the paper, proxies are important. Thirdly, the extraordinary data set provides an opportunity to compare different specifications of credit risk models, and so the competing-risks specification is compared to a pooled logit model (where all exits are pooled) and to a simple financial distress model (where the exit to financial distress is modelled and all other firms are treated as censored) ...|$|R
