40|$|The {{subject of}} this study is {{scholarly}} and scientific communication among a group of agriculture researchers in Mozambique.

The study gathered data to answer these questions in two ways: a bibliometric survey of <b>publications</b> <b>and</b> web sites; and a questionnaire survey of the researchers in Mozambique’s leading Agricultural Research Institute.
