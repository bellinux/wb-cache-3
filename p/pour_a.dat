In stanza 10, Odin finally relents to the rules of hospitality, urging Víðarr to stand and <b>pour</b> <b>a</b> drink for the quarrelsome guest. Víðarr does so, and then Loki toasts the Æsir before beginning his flyting.|$|E

25|$|The {{world record}} for the largest {{continuously}} poured concrete raft was achieved in August 2007 in Abu Dhabi by contracting firm Al Habtoor-CCC Joint Venture and the concrete supplier is Unibeton Ready Mix. The <b>pour</b> (<b>a</b> part of {{the foundation for the}} Abu Dhabi's Landmark Tower) was 16,000 cubic meters of concrete poured within a two-day period. The previous record, 13,200 cubic meters poured in 54 hours despite a severe tropical storm requiring the site to be covered with tarpaulins to allow work to continue, was achieved in 1992 by joint Japanese and South Korean consortiums Hazama Corporation and the Samsung C Corporation for the construction of the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.|$|E

25|$|The feast {{in honour of}} Jean de Brienne's arrival {{is taking}} place. Raymonda welcomes her guests, but cannot hide her uneasiness caused by Jean de Brienne’s delay. Abderakhman {{approaches}} her repeatedly and reveals his passion for her, but remembering the warnings of the White Lady, Raymonda rejects him with contempt. Abderakhman becomes even more insistent and realises {{the only way to}} possess Raymonda is by force. He calls his slaves to dance for her, after which he summons his cup bearers and they <b>pour</b> <b>a</b> potion into everyone’s cup, causing all the guests to become drunk. Seizing his chance, Abderakhman grabs Raymonda in an attempt to abduct her, but luckily Jean de Brienne arrives just in time, accompanied by King Andre II and his knights. Jean de Brienne saves Raymonda from the hands of the Saracens and tries to seize Abderakhman. The King commands the two rivals {{to put an end to}} the matter in a duel, during which the White Lady appears on the castle tower. Abderakhman is dazed and dies, slain by Jean de Brienne's sword. Raymonda joyfully embraces her fiancé and the two reaffirm their love as the King joins their hands.|$|E

500|$|Since no one {{below the}} status of {{governor}} held the legal power to enforce capital punishment, most recalcitrant Christians would {{have been sent to}} Caesarea to await punishment. The first martyr, Procopius, was sent to Caesarea from Scythopolis (Beit She'an, Israel), where he had been a reader and an exorcist. He was brought before the governor on June 7, 303, and asked to sacrifice to the gods, and to <b>pour</b> <b>a</b> libation for the emperors. Procopius responded by quoting Homer: [...] "the lordship of many is not a good thing; let there be one ruler, one king". The governor beheaded the man at once.|$|E

Three of the four M1895 Colt–Browning machine guns accompanying the Marines were used by Company C in the fighting. According to Pvt.

2500|$|A common folk {{test for}} the quality of moonshine was to <b>pour</b> <b>a</b> small {{quantity}} of it into a spoon and set it on fire. The theory was that a safe distillate burns with a blue flame, but a tainted distillate burns with a yellow flame. Practitioners of this simple test also held that if a radiator coil had been used as a condenser, then there would be lead in the distillate, which would give a reddish flame. This led to the mnemonic, [...] "Lead burns red and makes you dead." [...] or [...] "Red means dead." [...] Although the flame test will show the presence of lead and fusel oils, it will not reveal the presence of methanol (also poisonous), which burns with an invisible flame.|$|E

2500|$|Some of the game's {{criticism}} {{stemmed from}} the limitations of what procedural generation can bring to a game. While the engine can produce {{a vast array of}} different planets, it is built atop a finite number of predetermined assets, such as basic creature shapes or planetary biomes, and one quickly exhausts these core assets even with the variations allowed by procedural generation. An evaluation of the game's code showed that Hello Games had the foresight to enable new predetermined assets to be added into the game through updates, which Gamasutra Alissa McAloon suggested that with more artists to provide more content, Hello Games or third-parties could exponentially expand the perceived uniqueness of each planet. Kate Compton, who worked on the procedural generation elements of Spore, called this issue [...] "procedural oatmeal", in that while you can <b>pour</b> <b>a</b> near infinite number of bowls of oatmeal with various differences, the end result still will look like a bowl of oatmeal. Compton noted that No Man's Sky lacks a quality of perceptual uniqueness, a problem that other game researchers are looking to try to solve to provide a more crafted but still procedurally generated experience to the player, placing less emphasis on the vastness of potential outcomes as No Man's Skys marketing relied on.|$|E
2500|$|Pseudoscorpions {{are small}} {{arthropods}} with a flat, pear-shaped body and pincers that {{resemble those of}} scorpions. They range from [...] long. The opisthosoma {{is made up of}} twelve segments, each guarded by plate-like tergites above and sternites below. The abdomen is short and rounded at the rear, rather than extending into a segmented tail and stinger like true scorpions. The colour of the body can be yellowish-tan to dark-brown, with the paired claws often a contrasting colour. They may have two, four or no eyes. They have two very long pedipalps with palpal chelae (pincers) that strongly resemble the pincers found on a scorpion. The pedipalps generally consist of an immobile [...] "hand" [...] and [...] "finger", with a separate movable finger controlled by an adductor muscle. A venom gland and duct are usually located in the mobile finger; the poison is used to capture and immobilise the pseudoscorpion's prey. During digestion, pseudoscorpions <b>pour</b> <b>a</b> mildly corrosive fluid over the prey, then ingest the liquefied remains. Pseudoscorpions spin silk from a gland in their jaws to make disk-shaped cocoons for mating, molting, or waiting out cold weather. Another trait they share with their closest relatives, the spiders, is breathing through spiracles. Most spiders have one pair of spiracles, and one of book lungs, but pseudoscorpions do not have book lungs.|$|E
2500|$|There is a {{practice}} in many Orthodox communities {{to wash the}} hands before reciting birkat hamazon. This practice is called mayim acharonim (final waters). It is held that this, though a chovah (duty), is not a mitzvah (a commandment), as the practice was instituted for health reasons (specifically, to avoid the danger of touching the eyes with harmful salts). There is therefore no blessing said for this washing. A special ritual dispenser {{can be used to}} dispense the water, but does not need to be. [...] Although the practice is based on a ruling recorded in the Talmud, whether or not this ruling is still binding is a matter of dispute among various Orthodox communities, given that the practice of eating with knives and forks seems to remove the practical reason for it. [...] Some practice it as a binding halachah, others as an optional custom, and others do not practice it at all. [...] Among those who do practice mayim acharonim, the majority simply <b>pour</b> <b>a</b> small amount of water over their finger tips (note that according to the Mishna Berurah, this does not fulfill the terms of the obligation at all but according to the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch(43:1) [...] one [...] "need not wash the entire hand. It is sufficient to wash until the second joint of the fingers", while a minority, usually Yemenite Jews or related groups, will wash up to the wrist. One should not pause between the washing and saying birkat hamazon.|$|E
