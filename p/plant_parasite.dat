40|$|The {{coexistence}} of closely related <b>plant</b> <b>parasites</b> is widespread. Yet, understanding the ecological determinants of evolutionary divergence in <b>plant</b> <b>parasites</b> remains an issue. Niche differentiation through resource specialization {{has been widely}} researched, but it hardly explains the {{coexistence of}} parasites exploiting the same host plant. Time-partitioning has so far received less attention, although in temperate climates, parasites may specialize either in the early or in the late season. Accordingly we investigated whether seasonality can also promote phenotypic divergence. For <b>plant</b> <b>parasites,</b> seasonality generally engenders periodic host absence. To account for abrupt seasonal events, we made use of an epidemic model that combines continuous and discrete dynamics. Based on the assumption there is a trade-off between in-season transmission and inter-season survival, we found out through an 'evolutionary invasion analysis' that evolutionary divergence of the parasite phenotype can occur. Since such a trade-off has been reported, this study provides further ecological bases for the coexistence of closely related <b>plant</b> <b>parasites.</b> Moreover, this study provides original insights into the coexistence of sibling plant pathogens which perform either a single or several infection cycles within a season (mono- and poly-cyclic diseases, or uni- and multi-voltine life cycles) ...|$|R

40|$|Within the species-rich and trophically diverse phylum Nematoda, {{at least}} four {{independent}} major lineages of <b>plant</b> <b>parasites</b> have evolved, and {{in at least one}} of these major lineages plant parasitism arose independently multiple times. Ribosomal DNA data, sequence information from nematode-produced, plant cell wall–modifying enzymes, and the morphology and origin of the style(t), a protrusible piercing device used to penetrate the plant cell wall, all suggest that facultative and obligate <b>plant</b> <b>parasites</b> originate from fungivorous ancestors. Data on the nature and diversification of plant cell wall–modifying enzymes point at multiple horizontal gene transfer events from soil bacteria to bacterivorous nematodes resulting in several distinct lineages of fungal or oomycete-feeding nematodes. Ribosomal DNA frameworks with sequence data from more than 2, 700 nematode taxa combined with detailed morphological information allow for explicit hypotheses on the origin of agronomically important <b>plant</b> <b>parasites,</b> such as root-knot, cyst, and lesion nematodes...|$|R

50|$|Dendropemon emarginatus is {{commonly}} known as proud tree because it is said to be proud enough as to never touch the ground since it is always growing with support of some other plant.It is a <b>plant</b> <b>parasite</b> and is able to undergo photosynthesis during at least one stage of its life cycle (hemiparasite). It obtains water and required nutrients from its host plant's xylem through a structure called the haustorium, which also provides support by attaching and penetrating the host plant's bark. It is used to prepare tea to treat colds, worms and pain in general.|$|E
50|$|Phoradendron tomentosum, {{the leafy}} {{mistletoe}}, hairy mistletoe or Christmas mistletoe, is a <b>plant</b> <b>parasite.</b> It {{is characterized by}} its larger leaves and smaller berries than dwarf mistletoe. Leafy mistletoe seldom kill but they do rob their hosts of moisture and some minerals, causing stress during drought and reducing crop productions on fruit and nut trees.

50|$|Trichodoridae (stubby-root nematodes, trichodorids) is {{a family}} of {{terrestrial}} root feeding nematodes, being one of two that constitute suborder Triplonchida. They are economically important <b>plant</b> <b>parasites</b> and virus vectors.|$|R
50|$|The genus Acremonium {{is a large}} polyphyletic genus of {{approximately}} 150 species, {{many of which are}} derived from a closely related families in the Sordariomycetes. The genus includes many slow growing, simply structured, anamorphic filamentous fungi, typically encountered in wet, cellulose-based building materials suffering form chronic wet conditions. Characteristic morphology in this genus is septate hyphae giving rise to thin, tapered aculeate phialides that are usually unicellular, or weakly branched conidiophores. Human infections, though rare, usually occur in severely immunodeficient individuals. A. strictum is mostly known to be involved with myparasitic relationships, as well as being a <b>plant</b> <b>parasite</b> and endophyte.|$|E
5000|$|Botrytis is a genus of {{anamorphic}} {{fungi in}} the family Sclerotiniaceae. Botrytis (also known as grey mold) belongs to the group hyphomycetes and has about 30 different species. It is a <b>plant</b> <b>parasite</b> as well as saprophytes on both agricultural and forest trees. It produces stout, dark, branching conidiophores that bear clusters of paler conidia (grey in mass) on denticles from apical ampullae. It is a common outdoor fungus and can be detected in spore trap samples. The fungus is often found growing on indoor plants. Although no mycotoxin has been reported from this fungus, it may cause hay fever, asthma and keratomycosis.|$|E

Observations {{and descriptions of}} plant parasitic nematodes, which were less conspicuous to ancient scientists, didn't receive as much or as early attention as did animal parasites. The earliest allusion to a plant parasitic nematode is, however, preserved in famous writ. [...] "Sowed cockle, reap'd no corn," [...] a line by William Shakespeare penned in 1594 in Love's Labour's Lost, Act IV, Scene 3, most certainly has reference to blighted wheat caused by the <b>plant</b> <b>parasite,</b> Anguina tritici.|$|E

50|$|The Taphrinomycetes are dimorphic <b>plant</b> <b>parasites</b> (e.g. Taphrina) {{with both}} a yeast state and a {{filamentous}} (hyphal) state in infected plants. They characteristically infect leaves, catkins, and branches, not roots.|$|R
50|$|X. americanum is a <b>plant</b> <b>parasite</b> {{that lives}} {{entirely in the}} soil and is {{attracted}} to young, growing roots due to source-sink dynamics. These nematodes are migratory ectoparasites {{and all of the}} life stages of the American Dagger Nematode feed at the root tips of plants. Since it is a migratory ectoparasite, they remain outside the root or other feeding areas and feed on epidermal cells or on cells deeper in the root. This ectoparasitism allows the nematode to move freely to different hosts throughout its life cycle. This nematode is considered to be an obligate parasite. It can survive within plant debris, however it needs living plant tissue to feed.|$|E
50|$|In Burkina Faso and Mali, flowers tend {{to appear}} between December and March, but this varies from area to area and flowers may appear {{as late as}} July. The fruit is a four-winged {{elliptic}} samara, and has a sticky feel, reddish and turns yellowish {{towards the end of}} the season. The fruit typically measures 2.5 - 4 cm long and 1.5 - 3 cm across. It bears fruits generally in January and fruiting lasts until November. Seeds are collected by shaking the branches of the tree. The seeds are oil bearing and one kilogram contains about 20,000 seeds, and it has an oil potential yield of c. 24%. The <b>plant</b> <b>parasite</b> which infects Combretum glutinosum is Loranthaceae.|$|E
5000|$|Birds are {{the primary}} disease vector in the {{dispersal}} of the <b>plant</b> <b>parasite</b> leafy mistletoe. Birds consume the seeds from the fruit of P. tomentosum, also called drupes, and excrete or regurgitate the seeds onto the branches of which the birds perch. The most important birds for effective dispersal include cedar waxwings, euphonias, silky flycatcher, bluebirds, thrushes, robins, and solitaires. The seeds germinate within the tree for several years, eventually producing a haustorium, a root-like structure, that penetrates the host plant and extracts water and minerals from the infected tree or plant. Phoradendron is a hemiparasite, meaning that it produces its own chlorophyll, but relies on the host plant to provide essential elements for growth and survival. [...] Stems, flowers, and fruits also grow from the seed following germination with fruits being produced several years after infection.|$|E
50|$|Ustilaginomycotina {{comprises}} 115 genera {{with more}} than 1700 species. The subdivision is mostly <b>plant</b> <b>parasites</b> on vascular <b>plants,</b> {{and the distribution of}} the subdivision is therefore restricted to the distribution of the host. The group is also called the true smut fungi because of the production of teliospores. The name smut is still used as a term since it circumscribes the organization and life cycle of Ustilaginomycotina, {{but it is not a}} taxonomic term. Ustilaginomycotina has some of the best known and studied genera of <b>plant</b> <b>parasites</b> like Ustilago and Tilletia and it is also of great economic importance.|$|R
40|$|Soil is {{teeming with}} life, and {{rhizosphere}} soil {{is even more}} densely in habited than bulk soil. In terms of biomass, bacteria and fungi are dominant groups, whereas nematodes (roundworms) are the most abundant Metazoans. Bulk soil, soil not directly affected by living plant roots, typically harbours around 2000 – 4000 nematodes per 100 g, while in the rhizosphere these numbers should be multiplied by a factor 3 – 5. This difference is not only explained by a higher density of <b>plant</b> <b>parasites,</b> as also bacterivorous and fungivorous nematodes benefit from the local boost of the bacterial and fungal community. Most nematodes feeding on higher <b>plants</b> are obligatory <b>parasites.</b> In this chapter four independent lineages of plant-parasitic nematodes are discussed. Facultative <b>plant</b> <b>parasites</b> often occupy basal position...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{parasitism}} {{has arisen}} {{time and again}} in multiple phyla, including bacteria, fungi, insects and nematodes. In most of these organismal groups, the overwhelming diversity hampers a robust reconstruction of the origins and diversification patterns of this trophic lifestyle. Being a moderately diversified phylum with ≈ 4, 100 <b>plant</b> <b>parasites</b> (15 % of total biodiversity) subdivided over four independent lineages, nematodes constitute a major organismal group for which the genesis of plant parasitism could be mapped. Since substantial crop losses worldwide {{have been attributed to}} less than 1 % of these <b>plant</b> <b>parasites,</b> research efforts are severely biased towards this minority. With the first molecular characterisation of numerous basal and supposedly harmless <b>plant</b> <b>parasites</b> as well as their non-parasitic relatives, we were able to generate a comprehensive molecular framework that allows for the reconstruction of trophic diversification for a complete phylum. In each lineage <b>plant</b> <b>parasites</b> reside in a single taxonomic grouping (family or order), and by taking the coverage of the next lower taxonomic level as a measure for representation, 50, 67, 100 and 85 % of the known diversity was included. We revealed distinct gain and loss patterns with regard to plant parasitism per se as well as host exploitation strategies between these lineages. Our map of parasitic nematode biodiversity also revealed an unanticipated time reversal in which the two most ancient lineages showed the lowest level of ecological diversification and vice versa. </p...|$|R
