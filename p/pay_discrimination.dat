25|$|Lilly Ledbetter sued Goodyear {{claiming}} she {{was paid}} less than men {{doing the same}} work. She won the suit and was awarded $360,000, the jury deciding that Goodyear had clearly engaged in discrimination. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court. In Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 550 U.S. ___ (2007), Justice Alito held for the five-justice majority that employers are protected from lawsuits over race or gender <b>pay</b> <b>discrimination</b> if the claims are based on decisions made by the employer 180 days ago or more. The United States Congress overturned this decision by passing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 {{which was the first}} bill signed into law by President Obama.|$|E
25|$|The {{antecedents of}} the case were posed when Lilly Ledbetter, a {{production}} supervisor at a Goodyear tire plant in Alabama, filed an equal-pay lawsuit regarding <b>pay</b> <b>discrimination</b> under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, six months before her early retirement in 1998. The courts gave opposite verdicts, first supporting the complaint and later opposing; in conclusion the complaint brought {{the case to the}} attention of the Supreme Court. The latter ruled in 2007 by a 5-4 majority vote that Ledbetter's complaint was time-barred because the discriminatory decisions relating to pay had been made more than 180 days prior to the date she filed her charge, as explained by Justice Samuel Alito. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's dissenting opinion proposed an interpretation according to which the law runs from the date of any paycheck that contains an amount affected by a prior discriminatory pay decision.|$|E
30|$|Yet, {{as pointed}} out by Arrow ([1973]), in equilibrium, {{non-discriminatory}} employers employ more women at below-productivity wages than their discriminatory counterparts and therefore gain a competitive advantage over their competitors. Put differently, indulging discriminatory preferences comes at a cost in this framework. Indeed, empirical studies have documented that discriminatory employers make lower profits (Hellerstein et al.[2002]; Kawaguchi [2007]) {{and are more likely}} to exit the market (Weber and Zulehner [2014]). Employers actually seem to <b>pay</b> for <b>discrimination.</b>|$|R
30|$|Theoretical {{attempts}} of explaining {{this sort of}} wage discrimination typically take up Becker’s (1971) concept of employer discrimination due to distaste. In this framework, discriminatory employers are prejudiced against women and offer lower wages to women compared to equally productive men, giving rise to an unexplained gender pay gap in the sense given above. Since non-discriminatory employers employ more women at wages below their productivity, discriminating employers forego profits and discrimination comes at a competitive disadvantage. Discriminatory employers thus <b>pay</b> for <b>discrimination.</b>|$|R

25|$|By her own account, Casco {{began working}} with women's groups around 1946, mainly because she {{had the support of}} her brother Adolfo. While as a woman she had no real {{political}} power, she felt she had been less marginalized than others. Initially, women helped each other with social service needs, but in 1953, she and other professional women founded the Intituto Cultural de Amparo a la Mujer (Cultural Institute of Refuge for Women). Made up primarily of teachers, with a few doctors and lawyers, their objective was to counsel women and assist them in overcoming societal impediments, such as poor <b>pay,</b> <b>discrimination,</b> poverty, lack of health care, though at times they provided material support. They also attempted to refer women to other benevolent associations that {{might be able to help}} them. In 1954, a coup d'etat brought the dictator Alfredo Stroessner to power and within two years, he issued a decree banning the Institute and placing the women who organized it on lists of suspicious persons. The group did not disband, but instead transformed into the Women's Department of the Liberal Party, though in fact, the Liberal Party was still an illegal organization, as the one-party state was limited to the Colorado Party. Women were not allowed to run for office or participate in any decision-making process. Instead they performed benevolent works, visiting prisoners, raising money, hosting meetings and providing food for functions.|$|E
500|$|Ginsburg dissented in the Court's {{decision}} on Ledbetter v. Goodyear, , {{a case where}} plaintiff Lilly Ledbetter {{filed a lawsuit against}} her employer claiming <b>pay</b> <b>discrimination</b> based on her gender under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. [...] In a 5–4 decision, the majority interpreted the statute of limitations as starting to run at the time of every pay period, even if a woman did not know she was being paid less than her male colleague until later. Ginsburg found the result absurd, pointing out that women often do not know they are being paid less, and therefore it was unfair to expect them to act at the time of each paycheck. She also called attention to the reluctance women may have in male-dominated fields to making waves by filing lawsuits over small amounts, choosing instead to wait until the disparity accumulates. As part of her dissent, Ginsburg called on Congress to amend Title VII to undo the Court's decision with legislation. Following the election of President Barack Obama in 2008, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, making it easier for employees to win <b>pay</b> <b>discrimination</b> claims, became law. Ginsburg was credited with helping to inspire the law.|$|E
500|$|For {{the train}} ride to Washington, Obama invited 41"everyday Americans" [...] {{that he met}} during his presidential {{campaign}} to accompany him on the tour and attend other inaugural events, including the swearing-in ceremony, the parade and an inaugural ball. The group of citizens who joined the tour had shared stories with then-candidate Obama about {{themselves and their families}} during the presidential campaign, and included Matt Kuntz and Lilly Ledbetter. Kuntz, who lost his own step‑brother to suicide after returning home from the GulfWar, dedicated his efforts to improve mental health screening for IraqWar veterans. Ledbetter, who learned years later that her employer had discriminated against her in pay based on gender, lost her case before the Supreme Court because she did not file her claim within 180days of the discriminatory act. Nine days after his inauguration, Obama as president signed into law the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, allowing claims filed against employers not only within 180days of the <b>pay</b> <b>discrimination,</b> but also restarting the 180-day period for claims upon receiving any paycheck based on a discriminatory pay action.|$|E

In the prestigious University of Nairobi, according to Chege and Sifuna, less than 20% of teachers are female.|$|R
2500|$|Justice Ginsburg dissented {{from the}} opinion of the Court, joined by Justices Stevens, Souter, and Breyer. She argued against {{applying}} the 180-day limit to <b>pay</b> <b>discrimination,</b> because discrimination often occurs in small increments over large periods of time. Furthermore, the pay information of fellow workers is typically confidential and unavailable for comparison. Ginsburg argued that <b>pay</b> <b>discrimination</b> is inherently different from adverse actions, such as termination. Adverse actions are obvious, but small pay discrepancy is often difficult to recognize until more than 180 days of the pay change. Ginsburg argued that the broad remedial purpose of the statute was incompatible with the Court's [...] "cramped" [...] interpretation. Her dissent asserted that the employer had been, [...] "Knowingly carrying past <b>pay</b> <b>discrimination</b> forward" [...] during the 180-day charging period, and therefore could be held liable.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} {{of the concept of}} equal pay appears to derive from the notion that unequal <b>pay</b> represents <b>discrimination</b> against women, and hence is unjust. There is however a basic difficulty in defining "equal pay". The Commission felt that "outside the public service such a provision would affect only a small proportion of women workers". We certainly concur in this reasoning, since about 25 per cent of women workers are in occupations that are 90 per cent or more female and no doubt if more detailed data were available on grades etc. it would be clear that very few women are doing work for which there is an exactly comparable male rate of pay...|$|R
40|$|The paper asks why {{retirement}} {{can be so}} abrupt {{in countries}} such as France (½% of the workforce over 65), yet staged in Japan (8 % over 65). We find part of the answer in tax laws that prevent people working and receiving a pension, and make little allowance for fair pension increases if retirement is deferred. While these laws have begun to change, we find another part of the answer in employment protection laws. These laws coupled with inflexible collectively agreed wages make employers choosy about hiring the old. The advent of "age discrimination" law reinforces employment protection and may well reduce older workers' hiring opportunities especially where wages are rigid. mandatory retirement, deferred <b>pay,</b> age <b>discrimination,</b> older workers...|$|R
