25|$|The {{application}} of human security is highly relevant within {{the area of}} humanitarian intervention, as it focuses on addressing the deep rooted and multi-factorial <b>problems</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> humanitarian crises, and offers more long term resolutions. In general, the term humanitarian intervention generally applies to when a state uses force against another state in order to alleviate suffering in the latter state (See, humanitarian intervention).|$|E
25|$|The Mullum Mullum Creek {{suffers from}} many of the <b>problems</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> the {{development}} of urban environments and pollution in and around the creek is unfortunately quite prominent. Two of the most significant problems affecting the creek is sewage spills after heavy rain and leakage of septic tank effluent from residential properties into watercourses and subsequently, the creek itself. This is a problem that extends to the Yarra River and has become a major issue affecting the ecology of central Victoria and state politics.|$|E

25|$|In {{communicating}} with patients {{a major challenge}} in the campaign is the <b>problem</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> patient-centered care of giving patients some basis for understanding how {{to make decisions about}} their health care.

25|$|In late April, revelations {{occurred}} as the PRC government admitted to underreporting {{the number of}} cases of SARS due to the <b>problems</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> the healthcare system. Dr. Jiang Yanyong exposed the coverup that was occurring in China, at great personal risk. A number of PRC officials were fired from their posts, including the health minister and mayor of Beijing, and systems were set up to improve reporting and control in the SARS crisis. Since then, the PRC has taken a much more active and transparent role in combating the SARS epidemic.|$|E
25|$|Planar {{magnetic}} speakers (having printed or embedded conductors {{on a flat}} diaphragm) {{are sometimes}} described as ribbons, but are not truly ribbon speakers. The term planar is generally reserved for speakers with roughly rectangular flat surfaces that radiate in a bipolar (i.e., front and back) manner. Planar magnetic speakers consist of a flexible membrane with a voice coil printed or mounted on it. The current flowing through the coil interacts with the magnetic field of carefully placed magnets {{on either side of}} the diaphragm, causing the membrane to vibrate more or less uniformly and without much bending or wrinkling. The driving force covers a large percentage of the membrane surface and reduces resonance <b>problems</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> coil-driven flat diaphragms.|$|E
25|$|In December 1932 – January 1933, {{the actors}} were {{called back to}} film a number of optical effects shots which were mostly rear-screen projections. Technical <b>problems</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> the process made filming {{difficult}} and time-consuming. Wray spent most of a twenty-two hour period sitting in a fake tree to witness the battle between Kong and a Tyrannosaurus. She was sore for days after. Many of the scenes featuring Wray in the articulated hand were filmed at this time. In December, Cooper re shot {{the scene of the}} female New Yorker falling to her death. Stunt doubles were filmed for the water scenes depicting Driscoll and Ann escaping from Kong. A portion of the jungle set was reconstructed to film Denham snagging his sleeve on a branch during the pursuit scene. Originally, Denham ducked behind a bush to escape danger, but this was later considered cowardly and the scene was re shot. The final scene was originally staged {{on the top of the}} Empire State Building, but Cooper was dissatisfied and re shot the scene with Kong lying dead in the street with the crowd gathered about him.|$|E

25|$|Another factor {{important}} to consider {{in the understanding of}} the fishery's collapse is the uncertainty inherent in the assessment of the cod as a resource. Management of a resource is an extremely complex task, with a multitude of interests, perspectives, and sources of information to take into account; when knowledge regarding the resource is limited, or clouded by imprecision, the task of managing it becomes even more difficult. The management of fisheries are associated with an especially high degree of uncertainty due to <b>problems</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> the nature of the resource. Newfoundland's cod fisheries were no exception: an imperfect understanding of the ocean ecosystem; technical and environmental challenges associated with observation techniques, which led to incomplete data on the resource (the cod); and the naturally high levels of variability in the population due to dynamic environmental factors (such as ocean temperature) combined to make the discernment of the effects of exploitation an arduous task. Unfortunately, this led to predictions about the condition and future of the cod stock that were mired in uncertainty, making it more difficult for the government to choose the appropriate course of action.|$|E
25|$|Frere {{impressed}} {{upon the}} Colonial Office {{his belief that}} Cetshwayo's army had to be eliminated, an idea that was generally accepted until Frere sent Cetshwayo a provocative and impossible ultimatum in December 1878 and the home government began to realise the <b>problems</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> a native war. Cetshwayo was unable to comply with Frere's ultimatum-even if he had wanted to; Frere ordered Lord Chelmsford to invade Zululand, and so the Anglo-Zulu War began. Fourteen days later the disaster of Isandlwana was reported, and the House of Commons demanded that Frere be recalled. Beaconsfield supported him, however, and in a strange compromise he was censured but allowed to stay on. The Zulu trouble, and disaffection brewing in the Transvaal, reacted upon each other most disastrously. The delay in giving the country a constitution afforded a pretext for agitation to the discontented Boers, a rapidly increasing minority, while the reverse at Isandlwana had lowered British prestige. On his return to Cape Town, Frere found that his achievement had been eclipsed—first by 1 June 1879 death of Napoleon Eugene, Prince Imperial in Zululand, {{and then by the}} news that the government of the Transvaal and Natal, together with the high commissionership {{in the eastern part of}} South Africa, had been transferred from him to Sir Garnet Wolseley. Meanwhile, Boer resentment had boiled over and full-blown rebellion broke out in the Transvaal, leading to the First Boer War(1880–1881) and the independence of the Boer republics.|$|E

500|$|For one, Cobb has {{stressed}} the <b>problems</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> {{what he calls}} the “substantialist” worldview—ultimately derived from Classical Greek philosophy—that still dominates Christian theology, as well as most of western thought. [...] This [...] "substantialist" [...] way of thinking necessitates a mind-matter dualism, in which matter and mind are two fundamentally different kinds of entities. [...] It also encourages seeing relations between entities as being unimportant to what the entity is [...] "in itself." [...] In contrast to this view, Cobb follows Whitehead in attributing primacy to events and processes rather than substances. [...] In this Whiteheadian view, nothing is contained within its own sharp boundaries. [...] In fact, the way in which a thing relates to other things is what makes it [...] "what it is."

Sega reported the game sold 810,000 units worldwide during their last fiscal year period of 2008. However, consumer response was hampered by technical problems arising from incompatibility with certain Nvidia drivers released after the game's development was completed and reports of installation problems with the Steam content delivery system. In an interview with IGN, Studio Communications Manager Kieran Brigden discussed the <b>problems</b> <b>inherent</b> <b>in</b> developing such a huge and ambitious game, saying: [...] "Are there some issues with Empire? Yes there are." [...] As part of its post-release support, he said that Creative Assembly is planning on addressing issues with stability and performance, as well as adding improvements for gameplay and artificial intelligence.|$|E
