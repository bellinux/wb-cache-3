Prominent subfields of optical engineering include illumination engineering, photonics, and optoelectronics with practical applications like lens design, fabrication and testing of optical components, and image processing.

25|$|Although Burzynski and his {{associates}} claim success {{in the use of}} antineoplaston combinations for the treatment of various diseases, and some of the clinic's patients say they have been helped, {{there is no evidence of}} the clinical efficacy of these methods. The consensus among the <b>professional</b> <b>community,</b> as represented by the American Cancer Society and Cancer Research UK among others, is that antineoplaston therapy is unproven and the overall probability of the treatment turning out to be as claimed is low due to lack of credible mechanisms and the poor state of research after more than 35 years of investigation. While the antineoplaston therapy is marketed as a non-toxic alternative to chemotherapy, it is a form of chemotherapy with significant known side effects including severe neurotoxicity.|$|E

In this article the concept of <b>professional</b> <b>communities</b> is examined for certain subject departments in Dutch secondary schools. The authors report on research into {{the extent to which}} mathematics departments operate as <b>professional</b> <b>communities.</b> At the same time, it was investigated whether the level at which departments operate as <b>professional</b> <b>communities</b> is related to student achievement. The results indicate that departments are cohesive bodies regulating teacher behaviour in several respects. However, as <b>professional</b> <b>communities</b> they do not focus on improving the quality of their teachers and instruction. Some characteristics of <b>professional</b> <b>communities</b> prove to be beneficial for student achievement, while others are not.

This plan came to fruition in 1900 when the Sonnenhalde Clinic was opened in Riehen near Basel. Burckhardt served as the clinic's Medical Director from 1900 until 1904 and he remained a physician at the facility until his death from pneumonia on 6 February 1907. He was a marginal figure within the <b>professional</b> <b>community</b> of his psychiatric peers, attending few medical symposia and conferences in his discipline. However, he is often seen as a precursor to the Portuguese neurologist, Egas Moniz, who performed the first leucotomy, later known as lobotomy, in 1936.|$|E
500|$|When the {{war ended}} and the United States turned its focus toward re{{building}}, Roebling started building his Brooklyn Bridge. [...] As the monumental task could affect naval navigation, it required state approval, and the government wanted a thorough review of the engineer's credentials; hence, a Bridge Party was organized. [...] Comprising Roebling and his son, {{as well as their}} fellow bridge engineers, generals, businessmen, and high society figures, the party toured the country to review four bridges Roebling had built before the civil war. [...] The final item on their itinerary was Roebling's Niagara Suspension Bridge. [...] At the dinner to commemorate the end of the bridge tour, civil war veteran General Henry Warner Slocum gave a toast and called the Suspension Bridge a symbol of inspiration for the United States in its rebuilding efforts. [...] This sentiment was shared by the guests and was expressed at later dinners across the United States. [...] The achievement of building a large suspension bridge over a gorge in the face of overwhelming adversityconstant put-downs by the <b>professional</b> <b>community,</b> American and Europeangave the United States a sense of pride. [...] Nationalism rose as the country lauded the bridge. [...] The completion of the bridge that had been deemed impossible by the Western world gave Americans, who had lesser technical accomplishments than Europe at that time, a trophy that stood above any other. [...] The Suspension Bridge became the American symbol to brave the toughest of challenges and do the impossible, pushing their drive for industrialization even harder. Charles W. Woodman specifically drew attention to the Suspension Bridge in his 1865 address to the United States Senate for approval to build a rail system to transport a ship {{out of the water and}} up around the Niagara Falls.|$|E

The goal of this research was to describe the administrator and teachers 2 ÃÜ 7 perceptions with respect to <b>professional</b> learning <b>communities</b> as it related to teacher practice in their school. Educators and administrators were asked what types of practices teachers took from collaborative <b>professional</b> learning <b>communities</b> and tried in their classrooms. ^ This reputation-based, multiple-site case study was important to Nebraska educators because many school districts had implemented <b>professional</b> learning <b>communities</b> in a variety of forms in the schools.

The researcher found that <b>professional</b> learning <b>communities</b> had impacted teacher practice in that teachers had changed what they do from a pedagogical standpoint, as a result of interactions and collaboration in <b>professional</b> learning <b>communities.</b> The extent to which teacher pedagogical practice had been impacted is open to judgment. The fact that teachers had positively changed their pedagogy as a result of <b>professional</b> learning <b>community</b> function, including collaboration and interactions in <b>professional</b> learning <b>community</b> groups, is not open to judgment, as that is the primary finding of this study. ...|$|R

These dimensions involve the sharing of leadership, vision, values, and expertise as well as investigating student needs through collaborative inquiry. <b>Professional</b> learning <b>communities</b> need to meet regularly in order to address these dimensions.

The analyses indicated that <b>professional</b> learning <b>communities</b> have the potential to promote academic goals but expanded allocations of time and resources, improved acceptance by teachers, and stronger support of school leaders are needed. Recommendations include conducting a broader study to include more North Carolina School systems that are using <b>professional</b> learning <b>communities.</b> In addition, conducting a study that encompasses all grade levels using <b>professional</b> learning <b>communities</b> would be advantageous.
