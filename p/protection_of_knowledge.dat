40|$|I note, with interest, {{that the}} policy document, The <b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> Indigenous <b>Knowledge</b> through the Intellectual Property System, has paid {{particular}} heed {{to the experience of}} Australasia in dealing with traditional knowledge: “Lessons can be learned from New Zealand and Australia, which are both good examples of countries whose courts use the common law to protect traditional knowledge. ” I would comment that the Australian experience has been a mixed one. It is true that von Doussa J of the Federal Court of Australia has shown judicial innovation in a number of cases – most notably, the “Carpets” case, and the “Bulun Bulun” decision. However, there have been limits to the extent of judicial innovation in Australia – as illustrated by the refusal of the High Court of Australia to recognise the linkage between native title rights and traditional knowledge in the case of Ward v Western Australia. The case law has demonstrated {{that there is a need}} for a more fundamental legislative reform of laws with respect to traditional knowledge in Australia. Unfortunately, the Australian Parliament has thus far failed to heed the recommendations of Terri Janke’s landmark report, Our Culture, Our Future. The old Howard Conservative Government showed little interest in the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> traditional <b>knowledge.</b> A Federal bill on the recognition of communal moral rights in respect of copyright works created by Indigenous communities has not been implemented. Thus far, there have only been piecemeal reforms. The authenticity trade marks scheme, which was set up in 2000, has collapsed. The Federal access to genetic resources scheme does make reference to native title rights; but only provides limited remedies for non-compliance with the regime. The Queensland access to genetic resources regime fails to adequately address the issue <b>of</b> the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> traditional <b>knowledge.</b> The new Rudd Labor Federal Government has yet to establish its priorities in respect <b>of</b> the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> traditional <b>knowledge.</b> It has expressed an interest in establishing a right of resale – which would have the potential to benefit Indigenous artists and communities. Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities have been promoting the need for greater legislative <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> Indigenous Intellectual Property. I would note that Professor Mick Dodson of the National Centre for Indigenous Studies at the Australian National University has been instrumental in lobbying for the greater <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> traditional <b>knowledge</b> both in Australia and at an international level. He was influential in pushing for the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> Indigenous intellectual property as part of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 2007. In light of this experience, I would like to commend the Government of South Africa on its initiative in developing a substantive piece of legislation on the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> traditional <b>knowledge.</b> It is a shame that the Australian Government has not yet shown the same sense of purpose in developing a comprehensive regime for the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> traditional <b>knowledge...</b>|$|R

Through a case study of Late Babylonian colophons from Uruk, it is suggested that there is a strong correlation between texts related to the professional specialism of the tablet owner, and the occurrence of protective formulae in the colophon. This implies that it is fruitful to consider “secret knowledge” less as an abstracted corpus of esoteric texts and more as a mutable categorisation strongly linked to professional and individual intellectual identity...|$|E

40|$|The {{movement}} {{towards the}} <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> traditional <b>knowledge</b> {{particularly on the}} medicinal uses of plants (TKMUP) in South Africa reflects a global albeit belated interest in the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> traditional <b>knowledge</b> associated with biological resources. Hence, {{it was not surprising}} South Africa like most developing nation, sought in response to instances of the misappropriation of its TKMUP and other TK associated with its biological resources, to provide a measure <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> for such <b>knowledge</b> using the intellectual property (IP) system. This is evident in the adoption of the Policy Framework for the <b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> Indigenous <b>Knowledge</b> through the Intellectual Property System in 2008 which identified patent as one of the major IP tools in the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> the TK. The Policy Framework represents a paradigmatic shift from South Africa’s earlier sceptical and dialectical approach to, and experience with the IP system in context of TK. This paper therefore examines the benefits and challenges involved in using the patent system in the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> TK particularly those relating to the medicinal uses of plants (TKMUP). Such examination became necessary as South Africa’s natural capital of biological diversity, together with its wealth of indigenous TK, has been recognised as an important resource base for promoting economic growth through biological innovations under the recently adopted Bio-economy Strategy. It finds that patents offer a great potential in not only protecting TKMUP from misappropriation, but also in promoting the commercialisation of innovative TKMUP or inventions based on or derived from TKMUP in South Africa. However, this can only be possible if the challenges identified in this paper can be successfully navigated...|$|R
