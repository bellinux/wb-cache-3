The ability of this technology to shape student interests towards learning process is deemed as a learning development pattern for students particularly in the stage of childhood education. Therefore based on this scenario, two main research objectives are recognized i. e. to identify patterns of student scientific process skills aided by apps technology and thereon to identify student level of <b>proficiency</b> <b>profile</b> based on the patterns of preschool’s basic scientific process proficiency {{on the basis of}} collaborative learning strategy in authentic learning environment. Three research instruments are produced i. e.

The quasi-experimental design is applied on 25 preschool students from a controlled group and 25 preschool students from a treatment group that are selected based on quota sampling technique. Data analysis findings of the research through Mann-Whitney U Test found significant impact towards both groups with significant value (P value) = 0. 000. Hence, it can be concluded that there is {{a significant difference in the}} post-tests for both controlled and treatment groups with P value < 0. 05.

40|$|One {{of the big}} surprises I {{had when}} I started working with the latest OECD data on adult skills {{was that there were}} hardly any changes in the overall {{literacy}} <b>proficiency</b> <b>profiles</b> across countries that had participated in both PIAAC (the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies conducted in 2012) and IALS (the International Adult Literacy Survey in the 1990 s). In fact, small average declines were recorded in a number of countries. This was particularly strange given the fact that tertiary level qualifications among adult populations had increased substantially in the interim period in the majority of the countries. How could this be? Should I begin to doubt the highly intuitive idea that schooling and formal education develops literacy proficiency or at least reinforces it (especially at the higher level) ? Or should I believe, like far too many still do, that intelligence is fixed at birth and in the family? And that the measure of literacy in PIAAC and IALS simply reflects IQ that is untrainable? In any case, the apparent stagnation in overall literacy at the population level in so many OECD countries prompted me {{to take a closer look}} at the trend data made available from IALS and PIAAC, and to consider some of the major drivers affecting literacy <b>proficiency</b> <b>profiles</b> across countries. There are few other comparative data like these that can help us improve our insights on what drives the development and maintenance of literacy in adult populations...|$|R

A profile captures some key descriptors or preferences of a user and their browsing device. Individual users may maintain any number of profiles which they can edit for use in different situations, for different tasks or with different devices. A profile is {{described in terms of}} essentiality and proficiency. Essentiality is used to control the quantity of information that is transmitted and proficiency is used to control the format.

A key feature of the <b>proficiency</b> <b>profile</b> is the accessibility component which captures the user's tolerance of accessibility issues in a document, for example the presence of images or the markup of tables. The document delivery tool works as a kind of filter to reduce the content to the level of essentiality requested, to make the various presentation changes and to warn of accessibility issues as specified in the user's profile.

40|$|AbstractIf {{speaking}} {{today about}} the skills in the foreign languages field is an absolutely logical approach and without a need of additional justifications, the matter of their classification from the teaching and/or psychological point of view certainly remains open. The teacher's <b>proficiency</b> <b>profile</b> and the occupational standards which define the teaching career are in the centre of European debates on education topics in the last years, a significant attention being paid to all the challenges that decision makers face all the time: the elaboration of some attractive and incentivising initial training patterns adjusted to the current requirements, awareness of the teacher's role as co- ordinator and active factor of the educational process, identification of the best measures to facilitate the access into the profession, establishment {{of a set of}} skills which should properly meet the education quality criteria, increase of the conceptual coherence between the initial and the in-service training and, last but not least, the creation of some fair work conditions (financially and not only). The foreign language teaching profession is currently faced with increasing enrolments and a shortage of qualified teachers. At the same time, a rapidly changing student population, nationwide education reform and the development of national standards for foreign language learning are placing a number of new demands on foreign language teachers. Curtain and Pesola [1] suggest that foreign language teachers today “require a combination of competencies and background that may be unprecedented in the preparation of language teachers” and that strong professional development is critical. The present paperwork intends to briefly examine the competency profile of the modern language teacher of the XXIst century in Europe, with emphasis on his general needs of initial and in-service training, which are responsible for the shaping of a creative space for the study of foreign languages and of a “rejuvenated” portrait of the nowadays’ linguistic educator...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Globalization imposes {{challenges}} {{to the field of}} behavioural neurology, among which is an increase in the prevalence of bilingual aphasia. Thus, aphasiologists have increasingly focused on bilingual aphasia therapy and, more recently, on the identification of the most efficient procedures for triggering language recovery in bilinguals with aphasia. Therapy in both languages is often not available, and, thus, researchers have focused on the transfer of therapy effects from the treated language to the untreated one. Aim. This paper discusses the literature on bilingual aphasia therapy, with a focus on cross-linguistic therapy effects from the language in which therapy is provided to the untreated language. Methods. Fifteen articles including two systematic reviews, providing details on pre- and posttherapy in the adult bilingual population with poststroke aphasia and anomia are discussed with regard to variables that can influence {{the presence or absence of}} cross-linguistic transfer of therapy effects. Results and Discussion.

40|$|A {{common problem}} faced by most {{organizations}} in today 2 ̆ 7 s world {{is one of}} worker-task assignments. Assigning {{a large number of}} complex tasks to workers at various training levels can be a complicated process which has the potential to cost or to save a company large sums of money. The aim of this project is to develop a heuristic tool designed to match tasks to workers given the workers skills <b>proficiency</b> <b>profiles.</b> This heuristic should also provide a training plan which will rectify current worker skills gaps while minimizing training costs. Prior research maintained a focus on utilizing mathematical models of this skills management problem. The main difficulty with these mathematical models is that they were unable to reach feasible solutions in a reasonable amount of time when the problem size became large. It is therefore wise to investigate possible heuristic solution techniques. This research will compare and contrast three specific heuristic techniques: a Greedy Assignment Algorithm, Meta-RaPS Greedy Heuristic, and Meta-RaPS Shortest Augmenting Path (SAP) Heuristic. Meta-RaPS is a meta-heuristic that is used to improve the performance of algorithms by strategically infusing randomness which allows the exploration of more of the solution space.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{substantial}} research {{evidence on the}} role of attachment theory in hearing but not deaf children, whose families often receive inconsistent interventions, with adverse impact on the parent-child attachment. Such research is impeded by the lack of appropriate attachment measures. The aim {{of this study was to}} adapt such an attachment measure, and to evaluate its application with deaf children. The Manchester Child Attachment Story Task (MCAST) was initially administered to four deaf children, where an alternative transcript of the vignettes and interpreter protocol had to be developed. The researcher subsequently established a new pictorial method, the Deaf Child Attachment Story Task (DCAST), with supplementary administration, coding, and communication procedures. This was applied with 18 deaf children aged 3 - 9 years, recruited from eight Local Educational Authorities. The mental age obtained from the non-verbal scale of the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children was between 2. 50 to 12. 5 years. The Language <b>Proficiency</b> <b>Profile</b> (LPP) was also completed, with equivalent scores of 1 - 7 years. Assigned ratings of attachment (secure: 50 % vs. insecure: 50 %) were different to norms obtained for the general population, but partially supported previous studies in deaf children and attachment. A questionnaire (QoFL) and a semi-structured interview collected data to explore the context for the development of the child‟s attachment. Significant associations for secure attachment were identified for ten variables, including family life not being affected by communication, the child being confident and outgoing, and the child having both deaf and hearing friends. This provides relative validation of the new measure. These associations had partial support from themes identified in transcripts, including attitudes and difficulties with communication, and child behavioural problems. The findings can contribute to a better understanding of deaf children‟s attachment strategies. The adapted attachment measure has implications for future research and clinical practice with deaf children. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

This study compared the cognitive and social skills of two groups with differing language experiences: hearing-impaired (HI) children (n = 29) and younger hearing children (n = 45). The younger hearing children (5 to 8 years old) were expected to be similar to the HI children (8 to 11 years old) in their development of language and cognitive abilities. Parents and teachers rated children's social competence with the Social Skills Rating Scale. Children's skills were assessed with primarily nonverbal measurements of concept formation, emotional understanding (DANVA [...] -recognition of facial expression, and CAM [...] -recognition of emotional contexts), and cognitive perspective-taking ("hidden view" and "changed location" false-belief tasks). Teachers rated the HI children's expressive language skills with the Language <b>Proficiency</b> <b>Profile.</b> All of the data was utilized for within-group correlations; however, 29 hearing children were selected with a group-matching method (gender, race, and school) for between-group analyses. In comparison to the younger hearing children, the HI children performed similarly on emotional understanding tasks and more poorly on cognitive perspective-taking tasks. No clinically significant differences were found in ratings of social competence. All within-group correlations controlled for age effects. Exposure to signing programs and mothers' signing skills were positively correlated with the HI children's expressive language and concept formation abilities. The HI children's expressive language skills were positively associated with emotional understanding skills and ratings of social competence. For both groups, emotional understanding and cognitive perspective-taking were correlated, while concept formation was not correlated with any cognitive or social variables. Emotional understanding correlated with only the HI children's ratings of social competence. The HI children appeared to have qualitatively different development of cognitive and social skills as evidenced by (a) their uneven pattern of cognitive and social development in comparison to hearing children and (b) the different role that emotional understanding skills played in hearing and HI children's social competence.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Deciding how to construct a training programme or a training exercise, and especially what and how training media and methods should be selected to deliver effective and efficient training is an ongoing endeavour that preoccupies training analysts and designers alike. There are many interactions and dependencies {{that one has to}} take into consideration when making decisions, about cost, safety, or interactions between various components of a training system (e. g. between various types of media; between media and methods; between media, methods and trainees) to produce the desired outcome. The focus of this PhD research is to develop an understanding of the challenges faced by decision-makers within the military fast-jet training domain in constructing the training and, further, to develop solutions that support the decision-making effort. A significant challenge faced by decision-makers in constructing training programmes, identified through this research, is the ever increasing amount of information that they need to have at their disposal to enable fully informed decision-making and the lack of methods and tools to facilitate the management and analysis of this information. This research specifically investigated the problem of media selection to construct the training and developed a series of concept solutions to support differentiation between training media, assessment of trainees previous experiences, management of TNA outputs, selection of instructional methods and understanding of the cognitive relationship between media, method and trainee. The thesis firstly introduces the problem to be addressed; the research context and research questions set to be answered. This research, sponsored by Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSERC) and BAE Systems, is preceded by another BAE Systems funded research project (the Training Optimisation Case Study), which provided the background for the work presented in this thesis. Secondly, it reviews the literature relevant to the subject matter to understand the current state of knowledge in the area of: UK RAF training programmes construction and training media selection; assessment of competencies; impact of media and method on learning; development of decision making support systems; and construction and management of knowledge. The main part of the work presented in this thesis is the development of a series of support solutions to aid the decision-making process of construction of UK fast-jet pilot training. These include: TNA output Analysis (ToA) tool; Trainee Contextual <b>Proficiency</b> <b>Profile</b> (TCPP) tool; Training Media Classification Framework; models that map the cognitive relationship between media, method and trainee, and a unified Framework of Selection of Instructional Process alongside a novel approach towards training media selection. This research work was initially scoped through an exploratory study (a case study) into the domain area, followed by requirements elicitation. This part of research helped at identifying the issues within the problem area and in defining the research questions. The TCPP and ToA were verified through two case studies and presented alongside the rest of the research to the customer (BAE Systems) that gave positive feedback on the research outcomes...|$|E

40|$|At the University of California, Los Angeles, the Test of Oral Proficiency (TOP), an {{internally}} developed oral proficiency test, {{is administered}} to international teaching assistant (ITA) candidates to ensure an appropriate level of academic oral English proficiency. Test taker performances are rated live by two raters according to four subscales. While the subscale scores have potential as valuable feedback to major stakeholders, only a weighted {{average of the}} four subscale scores are currently reported and used. This study presents a way of extracting valuable information from the TOP subscale scores. In particular, it investigates an approach to obtaining oral English <b>proficiency</b> <b>profiles</b> based on the subscale score patterns of 960 TOP test takers. This study utilized item response theory and finite mixture modeling to investigate profiles of academic oral English proficiency {{in terms of the}} TOP subscales. A higher-order generalization of the graded response model was formulated to estimate subscale scores that accounted for structural dependencies and rater effects in the observed TOP scores. The estimated scores were clustered using a multivariate normal mixture model to yield subscale score profiles. The mixture model suggested seven profile groups and classified the TOP test takers into the seven groups. The profile groups were then interpreted and labeled based on characteristic score patterns and linguistic background shared by group members. To achieve a thorough understanding of the resulting profiles, discourse features of test taker performances sampled from different profile groups were closely examined. A small corpus was constructed based on the sampled test taker performances and compared to a reference corpus to explore the overall pattern of TOP test takers' language use. The comparison showed that the TOP test takers tended to use relatively fewer function words than speakers in the reference corpus. Characteristic features of each profile group's discourse were investigated through an identification and examination of discourse organizing lexical bundles. The results suggested that the use of metadiscourse and textual reference bundles with an explicit past reference point might be related to test takers' academic oral English proficiency...|$|R

40|$|The {{convergence}} of computer and communication technology, the readily availability, affordability and popularity {{of this new}} technology, {{as well as the}} impact of consumer behaviour of a diversity of technology-centred generations on global economic activities, all contribute to the provision of a base for the emerging of an information revolution that will both be far-reaching and unsettling. Society accordingly needs an appropriate and effective frame of reference, terminology and methodology for the establishment of psychological skills with which to equip people to handle the complexity of change in the future. The promovenda recognized the challenge to equip individuals and organizations with the required psychological skills. She studied the change phenomenon through action research and did this by way of a theoretical and empirical investigation. The thesis investigated change, planned change, transformation and related phenomena, such as technological development, globalization, diversity of the work force, ethical issues and generational differences in order to construct a context with which to understand the complexity of escalating and accelerating change. Predictable individual and organizational reactions to change were emphasized, whilst the principles of a learning organization were put forward as the best option for effectively dealing with change and transformation. Individual reactions to change formed the base of an integrated framework for the understanding of the psychodynamics of the phenomenon. Change cycles with characteristic phases were discussed. A holistic model of a phased approach to change was formulated, based on preceding research work by the candidate and also served as a frame of reference for the effective handling of change. The psychological dynamics of each phase were described and these also formed the foundation of a questionnaire, workshop and follow-up session related to the management of change. The theoretical investigation led to proposals on how leaders might render individual assistance to employees during interventions of planned change. The empirical component of the investigation consisted of a preliminary and a main investigation. The presentation of a workshop and accompanying follow-up session were assessed by means of a questionnaire that was completed prior to, during and after the intervention, amongst other by use of Cronbach’s approach to reliability assessment of the instrument, multiple analysis of variance with concomitant Scheffé tests as well as Hotelling’s T 2 test for the comparison of <b>profiles.</b> <b>Proficiency</b> in the handling of change was continually presented as the most preferred option that individuals and organizations could use for the establishment of learning skills with which to realize future change in the present day.
