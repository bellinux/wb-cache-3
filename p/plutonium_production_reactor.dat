5|$|The Hanford Site is {{a mostly}} {{decommissioned}} nuclear production complex {{operated by the}} United States federal government on the Columbia River in the U.S. state of Washington. The site has been known by many names, including: Hanford Project, Hanford Works, Hanford Engineer Works and Hanford Nuclear Reservation. Established in 1943 {{as part of the}} Manhattan Project in Hanford, south-central Washington, the site was home to the B Reactor, the first full-scale <b>plutonium</b> <b>production</b> <b>reactor</b> in the world. Plutonium manufactured at the site was used in the first nuclear bomb, tested at the Trinity site, and in Fat Man, the bomb detonated over Nagasaki, Japan.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{reactors}} {{were shut down}} between 1964 and 1971, with an average individual life span of 22 years. The last reactor, N Reactor, continued to operate as a dual-purpose reactor, being both a power reactor used to feed the civilian electrical grid via the Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) and a <b>plutonium</b> <b>production</b> <b>reactor</b> for nuclear weapons. N Reactor operated until 1987. Since then, most of the Hanford reactors have been entombed ("cocooned") to allow the radioactive materials to decay, and the surrounding structures have been removed and buried. The B-Reactor has not been cocooned and is accessible to the public on occasional guided tours. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992, and some historians advocate converting it into a museum. B reactor was designated a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service on August 19, 2008.|$|E
25|$|After the 1965 India-Pakistan War, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Foreign {{minister}} at that time, began {{to lobby for}} a nuclear weapons option. 'If India builds the bomb, we will eat grass or leaves, even go hungry, but we will get one of our own. We have no other choice'. 'In October 1965, Bhutto visited Vienna to attend the International Atomic Energy Agency meeting. While there, he met with Munir Ahmad Khan, and other Pakistani scientists working at IAEA. Pakistani IAEA scientists briefed Bhutto on the rapid development of Indian nuclear programme. According to Munir Ahmad Khan, the nuclear facility at Trombay consisted of a <b>plutonium</b> <b>production</b> <b>reactor,</b> a reprocessing plant, and other facilities associated to weapon production. Bhutto quickly arranged a meeting with Ayub Khan. After this meeting, Ayub Khan remained unconvinced, and rejected the proposal made by Munir Ahmad Khan. Khan notified Bhutto immediately and told him about what had happened.|$|E

500|$|At the Combined Policy Committee {{meeting in}} February 1946, without prior {{consultation}} with Canada, the British announced {{their intention to}} build a graphite-moderated nuclear reactor in the United Kingdom. An outraged Howe told Canadian ambassador Lester B. Pearson to inform the Committee that nuclear cooperation between Britain and Canada was at an end. The Canadians had been given what they deemed assurances that the Chalk River Laboratories would be a joint enterprise, and regarded the British decision as a breach of faith. Anglo-American cooperation largely ended in April 1946 when Truman declared that the United States would not assist Britain in the design, construction or operation of a <b>plutonium</b> <b>production</b> <b>reactor.</b> The Americans had agreed that such a facility could be built in Canada, but the British were not willing {{to be dependent on}} Canada for the supply of fissile material.|$|E
2500|$|Even though Zia {{had removed}} the Bhutto {{sentiment}} in the nuclear energy project, Zia did not completely disband Bhutto's policy on nuclear weapons. [...] After the retirement of Zahid Ali Akbar, Zia transferred control of the nuclear weapons programme to Bhutto's close aide Munir Ahmad Khan, Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission. Soon, Zia promoted Khan as the technical director of the entire programme as well as appointing Khan as his Science Adviser. With the support of handpicked civilian Prime Minister Muhammad Juneijo, Zia sanctioned {{the launch of the}} 50 Megawatt (MW) heavy water <b>plutonium</b> <b>production</b> <b>reactor,</b> known as Khushab-I, at Khushab in 1985. Zia also took initiatives to launched the space projects as spin-off to nuclear project. Zia appointed nuclear engineer Salim Mehmud as the Administrator of the Space Research Commission. Zia also launched the work on the country's first satellite, Badr-1, a military satellite. In 1987, Zia launched the clandestine aerospace project, the Integrated Missile Research Programme under General Anwar Shamim in 1985, and later under Lieutenant-General Talat Masood in 1987.|$|E

25|$|Since uranium and {{plutonium}} are {{nuclear weapons}} materials, {{there have been}} proliferation concerns. Ordinarily (in spent nuclear fuel), plutonium is reactor-grade plutonium. In addition to plutonium-239, which is highly suitable for building nuclear weapons, it contains large amounts of undesirable contaminants: plutonium-240, plutonium-241, and plutonium-238. These isotopes are extremely difficult to separate, and more cost-effective ways of obtaining fissile material exist (e.g. uranium enrichment or dedicated <b>plutonium</b> <b>production</b> <b>reactors).</b>|$|R

5000|$|Weapons-grade {{plutonium}} {{is defined}} as being predominantly Pu-239, typically about 93% Pu-239. [...] Pu-240 is produced when Pu-239 absorbs an additional neutron and fails to fission.

This makes plutonium unsuitable for use in gun-type nuclear weapons. To reduce the concentration of Pu-240 in the plutonium produced, weapons program <b>plutonium</b> <b>production</b> <b>reactors</b> (e.g. B Reactor) irradiate the uranium for a far shorter time than is normal for a nuclear power reactor.
