25|$|Central or {{traditional}} electricity planning {{is designed to}} expand supply resources to meet demand growth and to minimize the economic costs of this expansion by improving economies of scale in electricity generation. Economies of scale exist for a vertically integrated electric utility because a larger generating system can provide power to many users, and additional users can be accommodated with small increases in <b>power</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|E

In 2009, NAB became the largest Fairtrade accredited workplace in Australia through purchasing Fairtrade tea, coffee and hot chocolate for their offices and retail branches. In March 2010 NAB stated it expected to save nearly $1 million in annual <b>power</b> <b>costs</b> from a $6.5 million tri-generation plant at its main data centre. NAB became one of Australia's largest carbon neutral companies in September 2010.

Even though they are typically very poor, these people have to pay far more for lighting than people in rich countries because they use inefficient kerosene lamps. Solar <b>power</b> <b>costs</b> half as much as lighting with kerosene. An estimated 3 million households get power from small solar PV systems. Kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita. More than 30,000 very small solar panels, each producing 12 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya annually.|$|E
25|$|Currently, many HF {{units are}} {{operating}} below the design isobutene-to-olefin ratio, but {{to obtain the}} required octane, due to increasingly tight gasoline specifications, these ratios {{will need to be}} increased back to design ratios. The SAAU process employs either electric or turbine drives for the reactors and compressor to optimize refinery utilities. Horsepower input to the HF reaction zone is lower than to the H2SO4 reaction zone. In addition, the HF process does not require refrigeration. Therefore, <b>power</b> <b>costs</b> are less for HF units. Normally, the difference in fractionation costs outweighs this advantage when comparing overall utility costs. However, HF units may show a utility advantage if fuel cost is low relative to power cost.|$|E
25|$|The {{petition}} from Ayr urged {{an extension}} {{south and west}} but the Caledonian and the L {{were more interested in}} extending east and north. The L had been successful in capturing the majority of the mineral traffic from Lanarkshire to Ardrossan, but it still required the heavy and slow trains to travel via the junctions {{on the south side of}} Glasgow, along congested routes. Part of the haul was along the Glasgow Barrhead and Kilmarnock joint line, shared with the GS, which had difficult gradients, incurring significant extra engine <b>power</b> <b>costs.</b> In 1897 the Caledonian decided to subscribe £152,000 towards the £502,000 cost of extending the L line back from Giffen to Newton. This would considerably shorten the route from the mineral areas and escape involvement with the G altogether.|$|E
