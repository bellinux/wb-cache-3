Population and hybrid varieties of rye were grown during 2003 – 2005. Trials were situated in three different locations of the Czech Republic – Hradec nad Svitavou, Krásné údolí and Staňkov. Content of <b>pentosans</b> varied between 6. 60 – 9. 21 %. The highest content of <b>pentosans</b> (average of the three years and three locations) achieved the hybrid variety Picasso (8. 11 %), which had the highest Falling number (235. 8 s) and amylograph maximum (625. 5 AJ), too.

40|$|Keywords: <b>pentosans,</b> gluten yield, gluten properties, {{glutenin}} macropolymerThe gluten protein polymeric network plays {{a pivotal}} role in determining the end-use quality of wheat in many food products. The properties of this polymeric network are strongly affected by wheat flour composition (protein, starch and <b>pentosans</b> etc.), ingredients (i. e. salt, fat), processing aids (i. e. enzymes) and process parameters (mixing time, mixing water, temperature). Although the content of <b>pentosans,</b> usually divided into water unextractable solids (WUS) and water extractable <b>pentosans</b> (WEP) in wheat flour is low (1 - 2 %w/w), these polymers {{play an important role in}} gluten formation and properties. Unravelling the underlying relationships and understanding the effect of <b>pentosans</b> on gluten network formation is, therefore, of extreme importance. The aim of this thesis is to clarify the mechanism of action of <b>pentosans</b> on gluten formation and properties. The study was greatly facilitated by the use of a miniaturized set-up for gluten-starch separation. This allowed us to systematically study the effect of <b>pentosans</b> on gluten formation and properties gluten.  The results show that both WUS and WEP affect gluten yield, composition and properties in a similar fashion. Pretreatment of WUS and WEP with xylanase did not remove the negative effect on gluten yield, but addition of xylanase or ferulic acid (FA) during gluten extraction did. Added <b>pentosans</b> hinder gluten agglomeration even if they are only present during the dough dilution phase. This is only partly related to a viscosity effect. FA related interactions are more important here. Both act on the ability of glutenin macropolymer (GMP) particles to form gluten, affecting both gluten yield and gluten rheological properties. We propose that <b>pentosans</b> interfere with gluten formation in both an indirect and a direct way. The indirect effect is related to water availability. The direct effect is related to an interaction between <b>pentosans</b> and gluten in which FA plays an important role. The interference of WUS or WEP with gluten formation caused an incomplete aggregation of gluten protein, which was reflected in a larger average GMP particle size and a smaller tendency of these particles to aggregate. If xylanase or FA were added, aggregation was more complete, which was reflected in a smaller average GMP particle size and a larger tendency of these particles to aggregate. Now, also smaller GMP particles were recovered. The same trend was found with three wheat cultivars of very different qualities. Based on our results, we propose a possible explanation for the effect of <b>pentosans</b> on gluten formation and properties. Both a physical effect and a chemical effect are involved. The physical effect is related to viscosity and likely also depletion attraction between protein particles. The chemical effect is related to FA and 'controls' the tendency of the particles to aggregate and hence also gluten yield. In our explanation <b>pentosans</b> do not so much affect the growth of these particles directly after mixing, but hinder the further agglomeration of especially smaller particles to end up in the gluten. The partial agglomeration of GMP particles will result in turn in GMP with a different GMP particle size distribution and hence in gluten with changed rheological properties...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{series of}} {{experiments}} was designed to analyze the antinutritive compound(s) in rye that depress nutrient utilization; these {{were found to be}} mainly associated with the rye flour fraction. The bran fraction, however, more effectively depressed feed intake than the flour fraction. A starch-rich isolate, which contained most of the antinutritive activity from rye, as well as a protein-rich isolate devoid of activity, were prepared from the flour. Treating the starch-rich isolate of rye flour with. 1 N NaOH stabilized the antinutritive factor. Centrifugation of the NaOH isolate produced four fractions. The supernatant fraction contained considerable quantities of water-soluble and highly viscous <b>pentosans</b> and was the only fraction that significantly depressed nutrient utilization. Increasing additions of the water soluble fraction to a control diet resulted in nearly proportionate decreases in the retention of dry matter and fat. An ethanol fractionation produced an ethanol-insoluble precipitate that contained a two-fold increased concentration of the water-sol-uble <b>pentosans</b> and demonstrated a two-fold increase in antinutritive activity.

Multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis and partial least squares (PLS) analysis were introduced to develop statistical models in terms of calibration equations for total pulp yield, screened pulp yield, and contents of α-cellulose, <b>pentosans,</b> and lignin in wood. In MLR analysis, a reasonably good calibration equation was found only for <b>pentosans</b> (standard error of prediction (SEP): 0.98 %).

40|$|A {{previously}} proposed {{explanation for}} the change in gluten properties on addition of <b>pentosans</b> to doughs was based on data for only one wheat cultivar.

40|$|Effects of enzymatic {{modification}} of starch, proteins and <b>pentosans</b> on dough and tortilla properties {{were determined to}} establish the role of these wheat components in tortilla staling. Starch, protein and <b>pentosans</b> were respectively modified with a-amylase, protease and transglutaminase (TG), and xylanase. Tortillas were stored at 22 oC and evaluated {{for at least three}} weeks. Amylase improved shelf-stability of tortillas, produced a significant amount of dextrins and sugars, retarded decrease in amylose solubility, and weakened starch granules. However, control and treated tortillas had similar degrees of amylopectin crystallinity. Staling of tortillas appears to involve starch that reassociates into an amorphous structure. Micrographs of control dough had thin protein strands forming a continuous matrix. Protease-treated dough had pieces of proteins in place of the continuous matrix, while TG-treated dough had thicker protein strands that were heterogeneously distributed. Both treatments resulted in shorter shelf-stability of tortillas. The organization of protein in dough is important for dough structure and appears to impact tortilla flexibility. Protein solubility and SDS-PAGE results did not differentiate control and treated dough or tortillas. The fractions or molecular weight distribution are not significant determinants of protein functionality. Tertiary and quaternary protein structures of gluten may be more related to tortilla shelf-stability. The 75 ppm xylanase treatment resulted in weaker tortilla structure and significantly higher amounts of low molecular weight saccharides and sugars. Control and the 25 ppm treatment sample had a similar shelf-stability and texture profile. <b>Pentosans</b> may affect staling indirectly through the effect on gluten development. Fresh tortillas have amylopectin in an amorphous state, while amylose is mostly retrograded. The gluten matrix provides additional structure and flexibility to the tortilla. <b>Pentosans</b> {{may or may not be}} attached to the gluten network. Upon storage, amylopectin retrogrades and recrystallizes, firming the starch granules, resulting in firmer tortillas. Starch hydrolysis decreased the rigid structure and plasticized polymers during storage. It also reduced the restriction imposed by retrograded starch on gluten and allowed it more flexibility. Thus, the flexibility of tortillas results from the combined functionalities of amylose gel, amylopectin solidifying the starch granules during storage, and the changed functionality of gluten after baking...|$|R

40|$|Malting and {{fermentation}} {{were applied}} to modify endogenously the sorghum grain components, {{with the aim of}} alleviating grittiness, dryness and crumb firmness normally associated with inclusion of sorghum flour in composite bread. Malt amylases were effectively inactivated by boiling, before drying at high temperatures. A fractionation and reconstitution process revealed that malting and boiling dextrinized and gelatinized starch, increased water-soluble <b>pentosans</b> and crude fiber. Dextrinization and gelatinization of starch decreased gelatinization temperature and the rate of starch retrogradation, thus decreasing crumb grittiness and firmness. The increase in crude fiber and water-soluble <b>pentosans</b> caused by the germinating grain root and shoot growth and the hydrolysis of non-starch polysaccharides, respectively, during malting, increased water-holding capacity and dough viscosity, thus decreasing dryness and the crumb-firming rate.
