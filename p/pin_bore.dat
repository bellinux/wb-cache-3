5000|$|The TRX250R was {{introduced}} for the 1986 model year to answer Suzuki’s LT250R, released the year prior. Honda borrowed many parts from its 3 wheel ATC250R for the Fourtrax’s design, including {{the engine and}} rear suspension. Although mechanically similar, Honda detuned the engine {{for use in the}} Fourtrax, through reduced compression and less aggressive porting, to ensure that the added weight of the quad would not adversely affect the reliability of the engine. [...] The 1987 model year, now absent the three-wheelers due to the CPSC ban, saw the engine receive a five-millimeter longer connecting rod, accompanied by a piston with a wrist <b>pin</b> <b>bore</b> raised five millimeters. Additionally, the cylinder was changed to include a bridged intake. Most of the chassis of the 1987 Fourtrax remained the same. The 1988 model year brought the most dramatic changes to the TRX250R. The compression ratio of the engine was raised to generate more power, bringing it nearly on par with Kawasaki’s powervalved Tecate-4. It was the chassis, however, that received the greatest attention, shedding 25 pounds over the previous year’s model. Additionally a shorter aluminum swing arm was added, but the frame lengthened such that the overall wheelbase was slightly greater. This shifted the weight bias rearward, curing the Fourtrax’s “loop out” problem. Aesthetically, the Fourtrax’s headlight was moved from the handlebars to a mount molded into the hood. This was also the only year to be available with red fenders. For 1989 the TRX250R received few changes. Most notable was the use of a needle bearing in the clutch pressure plate, for smoother action. This needle bearing was a necessary upgrade for the 1988 TRX250R, as well 3. The color was returned to white for its final year.|$|E
40|$|An {{electrical}} feedthrough (34) {{is prepared}} by furnishing an aluminum oxide feedthrough plate (70) {{and at least}} one feedthrough pin (80) having a length greater than the thickness of the feedthrough plate (70). A <b>pin</b> <b>bore</b> (78) is formed through the feedthrough plate (70) for each feedthrough pin (80). Each <b>pin</b> <b>bore</b> (78) has a <b>pin</b> <b>bore</b> (78) size greater than the feedthrough pin (80) size, preferably by an amount no greater than that required to permit the penetration of a brazing metal (88) between the <b>pin</b> <b>bore</b> (78) and the feedthrough pin (80). Each feedthrough pin (80) is inserted into its respective <b>pin</b> <b>bore</b> (78) and brazed into place utilizing a metallic active braze alloy (88) and no glassy seal. The feedthrough plate (70) may be simultaneously brazed to a package structure (22) using active or nonactive brazing...|$|E

30|$|Subsystem C is rough <b>pin</b> hole <b>boring</b> machine {{used to make}} {{pin holes}} on the piston to give proper size to the holes, which are used to fit the pin by which a rod is {{connected}} to crankshaft.|$|R
30|$|Similarly, {{the repair}} rate {{fluctuations}} {{have been studied}} for the effect of maintenance on time-dependent availability {{in the case of}} system S 2 as well. We found that time-dependent availability of the system S 2 shows 0.5 % increase for circlip grooving with decrease in value of its repair rate parameter. In case of finish <b>pin</b> hole <b>boring,</b> the time-dependent availability of the system improved by 0.2 % when its repair rates decrease. The effect on time-dependent availability was found to be negligible in case of other subsystems and can be referred from Tables  8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{witnesses}} {{an application}} of process tolerancing which proves {{to be a better}} way of finding the optimal tolerancing of the part, leading to fewer process rejections and improved quality levels. The end results of the process capability values and tolerances obtained from tolerance charting of connecting rod machining process are compared with a tolerance capability expert software. The results showed further scope of improvement for the thrust face thickness and gudgeon <b>pin</b> <b>bore</b> diameter, whereas the crank <b>pin</b> <b>bore</b> diameter after honing operation showed close resemblance between the values obtained through process capability and tolerance capability expert software.|$|E
30|$|The process {{capability}} studies on thrust face thickness, bolt hole center distance and crank <b>pin</b> <b>bore</b> diameter critical-to-quality characteristics of connecting rod were performed. After making the process capable through DMAIC approach, the end {{results of these}} {{process capability}} studies {{in the form of}} process capability values and tolerances obtained from tolerance charting of connecting rod machining process are compared with a tolerance capability expert software (Tec-ease.com 2014) and the results are documented.|$|E
30|$|Similarly, {{repair rate}} {{fluctuations}} {{have been studied}} for the effect of maintenance on time-dependent availability of the system. We found that the time-dependent availability of system S 1 shows 0.001 % increase for fixture seat machining and rough <b>pin</b> hole <b>boring,</b> and for other subsystems, time-dependent availability shows 0.01 % (for rough grooving cum tuning and finish profile turning), 0.02 % (for rough oil drilling), and 0.025 % increase (for finish grooving) with corresponding increase in repair rates as observed from Tables  2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So the weak subsystem {{was found to be}} the fixture seat machining which is due to the effect maintenance practice as well.|$|R
5000|$|On April 18, 1945 in Leipzig, Germany, while Bowman {{and other}} troops were {{fighting}} {{to secure a}} bridge from a position inside an apartment building, Bowman {{was shot and killed}} by a German sniper while reloading his machine gun. Nearby photographer Robert Capa captured images of the fight, Bowman's death, and the immediate aftermath, which gained fame in Life magazine with the caption [...] "The picture of the last man to die." [...] The Life magazine article did not identify the soldiers in the photographs by name, although Bowman's family recognized him by the small <b>pin</b> (which <b>bore</b> his initials) that he always wore on his collar.|$|R
50|$|Initial {{problems}} with this lug cracking drove further development of the M1922 resulting in the final M2 version. the main distinguishing change in the M2 variant was the incorporation of an adjustable headspace mechanism in the locking lug. This mechanism consisted of an Allen key screw that passed through the locking lug bearing against the right rear receiver wall. This headspace screw was locked in place, after adjustment, by a brass <b>pin</b> that <b>bore</b> against headspace screws' threads. the brass pin was not threaded but {{held in place by}} a lead plug. The lead plug shows a small eagle that was pressed into the plug by the special tool used by the armourer. If the eagle was disturbed the armourer would know that an attempt had been made to change the headspace by unauthorised personnel.|$|R
50|$|The 24 in bore by 28 in stroke {{cylinders}} were interchangeable {{with those}} of the Class 16E. A 4+1/2 in thick cast-iron liner was fitted between the smokebox and its saddle to obtain this interchangeability. The cylinders had cast-iron liners and the steam and exhaust valve seatings were renewable. The connecting and coupling rods were fitted with floating bronze bushes and all crank <b>pins</b> were hollow <b>bored.</b> Soft grease lubrication was used for the motion, while the coupled wheel axle boxes were hard grease lubricated.|$|R
50|$|An example:The {{allowance}} {{per inch}} of diameter usually ranges from 0.001 inch to 0.0025 inch (0.1-0.25%), 0.0015 inch (0.15%) being a fair average. Ordinarily the allowance per inch decreases as the diameter increases; thus the total allowance for {{a diameter of}} 2 inches (50.8 mm) might be 0.004 inch (0.102 mm, 0.2%), whereas for a diameter of 8 inches (203.2 mm) the total allowance might not be over 0.009 or 0.010 inch (0.23 or 0.25 mm, i.e. 0.11-0.12%). The parts to be assembled by forced fits are usually made cylindrical, although sometimes they are slightly tapered. Advantages of the taper form are: the possibility of abrasion of the fitted surfaces is reduced; less pressure is required in assembling; and parts are more readily separated when renewal is required. On the other hand, the taper fit is less reliable, because if it loosens, the entire fit is free with but little axial movement. Some lubricant, such as white lead and lard oil mixed to the consistency of paint, should {{be applied to the}} <b>pin</b> and <b>bore</b> before assembling, to reduce the tendency toward abrasion.|$|R
40|$|The overall aim of {{this article}} is to outline the {{progress}} of the research on how to develop an economically and scientifically justified backhoe buckets boreholes renewal technology by using mobile on-site technological equipment. Today the new mobile (in-situ) repair technologies are extensively used for the specialized equipment and machinery repairs. This repair technology is deployed directly on the damaged product: repair equipment is installed by using specialized centering devices. The bucket bores central axes are used as a reference base and damaged layer of material is removed mechanically applying turning operation. Subsequently the renewable surface is covered by new material layer by means of regular MIG/MAG welding. The last technological operation is final turning to the nominal diameter. Outlined renewal technology should meet high expectations – this necessitates in-depth and systematic study of <b>pins</b> and <b>bores</b> which are the most repaired objects of shovel bucket excavators. Therefore, research on established accuracy and technical requirements, both for the repaired unit and technological equipment in line with in-situ repair technology specifics, has been done. It was supported by impact analysis of the technological regimes to surface integrity with ambition to provide practical recommendations for the optimal choice of the technological regimes...|$|R

40|$|The exact {{dependence}} of wear factor on contact stress, load and apparent contact area is much disputed in the literature. This study attempts {{to solve this}} dispute. Pin-on-plate studies of {{ultra high molecular weight}} polyethylene against stainless steel were conducted under different combinations of load (33 - 250 N), nominal stress (0. 56 - 12. 73 MPa) and face diameter, as well as two tests where both stress and load were kept constant, while the diameter was changed. For these tests the centre of the <b>pin</b> face was <b>bored</b> out to create four different average pin diameters with similar face areas. Diameter and load were found to have no significant effect on the wear factor, while the wear factor decreased with increasing contact stress according to the relation K = 2 x 10 - 6 &# 963;- 0. 84...|$|R
5000|$|The mascot is the Hornet. Although {{many have}} thought the {{original}} mascot was an owl, {{no evidence of that}} exists in published NKCHS yearbooks that we have found. There is; however, evidence of the Hornet mascot in the 1929 yearbook. The confusion comes with the name of the yearbook from 1924 through 1949; which was [...] "The Owl" [...] yearbook. High school jewelry like <b>pins,</b> etc. also <b>bore</b> the image of an owl; however, {{there is no evidence that}} the owl was the school's [...] "mascot". The evidence is even stronger when you read in the 1929 Owl yearbook where the Pep Squad states, [...] "All right, let's everybody give fifteen big [...] "Rahs" [...] for the [...] "Hornets". Again in the 1930 NKCHS Owl yearbook you can see the Hornet on the Basketball player's shirts.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{connecting rod}} beam (forging ID C9OE-A) featured drilled oil squirt bosses to lubricate the piston <b>pin</b> and cylinder <b>bore</b> and rectangular-head rod bolts mounted on broached shoulders. A number of fatigue failures {{were attributed to}} the machining of the part, so the bolt head area was spot-faced to retain metal in the critical area, requiring the use of 'football head' bolts. In 1975, the beam forging (D6OE-AA) was updated with more metal in the bolt-head area. The oil squirt bosses were drilled for use in export engines, where the quality of accessible lubricants was questionable. The rod cap forging remained the same on both units (part ID C9OE-A). In 1982, {{the design of the}} Essex V6 engine used {{a new version of the}} 351W connecting rod (E2AE-A), the difference between the two parts was that the V6 and V8 units were machined in metric and SAE units, respectively. The cap featured a longer boss for balancing than the original design.|$|R
