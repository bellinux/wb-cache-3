5|$|The primary {{armament}} of the Kongō class {{consisted of}} eight 45-calibre 14-inch guns, mounted in four superfiring twin-gun turrets. The turrets had an elevation capability of 5/+20 degrees except in Kongō whose turrets had a maximum elevation capability of +25 degrees. The shells could be loaded at any angle and the guns had a firing cycle of 30–40 seconds. These guns and their turrets underwent multiple modernizations throughout the ships' careers. During the first {{reconstruction of the}} class during the 1920s, the elevation of the main guns was increased {{to a maximum of}} +33 degrees. The recoil mechanism of the guns was also changed from a hydraulic to <b>pneumatic</b> <b>system,</b> which allowed for a faster firing cycle of the main guns.|$|E

25|$|McKesson's Robot RX {{is another}} {{healthcare}} robotics product that helps pharmacies dispense thousands of medications daily {{with little or}} no errors. The robot can be ten feet wide and thirty feet long and can hold hundreds of different kinds of medications and thousands of doses. The pharmacy saves many resources like staff members that are otherwise unavailable in a resource scarce industry. It uses an electromechanical head coupled with a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>system</b> to capture each dose and deliver it to its either stocked or dispensed location. The head moves along a single axis while it rotates 180 degrees to pull the medications. During this process it uses barcode technology to verify its pulling the correct drug. It then delivers the drug to a patient specific bin on a conveyor belt. Once the bin is filled with all of the drugs that a particular patient needs and that the robot stocks, the bin is then released and returned out on the conveyor belt to a technician waiting to load it into a cart for delivery to the floor.|$|E

500|$|The twelve 45-calibre [...] Type 41 guns of the Ise {{class were}} mounted in {{three pairs of}} twin-gun, superfiring turrets. Numbered one through six from front to rear, each turret weighed [...] The {{hydraulically}} powered turrets had an elevation capability of −5/+20 degrees. The guns had a rate of fire of 1.5–2 rounds per minute and could be loaded at any angle between -3 and +20 degrees. In 1921 the elevation was increased to +30 degrees and then to +43 degrees during their mid-1930s modernization, except for No. 6 turret as its supporting structure could not be lowered. The recoil mechanism of the guns was also changed from a hydraulic to a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>system,</b> which allowed for a faster firing cycle of the main guns.|$|E
500|$|The YB-52, {{the second}} XB-52 {{modified}} with more operational equipment, first flew on 15 April 1952 with [...] "Tex" [...] Johnston as pilot. During ground testing on 29 November 1951, the XB-52's <b>pneumatic</b> <b>system</b> failed during a full-pressure test; the resulting explosion severely damaged the trailing {{edge of the}} wing, necessitating considerable repairs. A two-hour, 21-minute proving flight from Boeing Field, King County, in Seattle, Washington to Larson AFB was undertaken with Boeing test pilot Johnston and air force Lieutenant Colonel Guy M. Townsend. The XB-52 followed on 2 October 1952. The thorough development, including 670 days in the wind tunnel and 130 days of aerodynamic and aeroelastic testing, paid off with smooth flight testing. Encouraged, the air force increased its order to 282 B-52s.|$|E

One prototype was ordered from each company for delivery during the summer of 1935.

500|$|After {{successfully}} {{testing a}} Ticka watch camera {{on a train}} and whilst riding a sled, Neubronner began {{the development of a}} light miniature camera that could be fitted to a pigeon's breast by means of a harness and an aluminum cuirass. Using wooden camera models which weighed , the pigeons were carefully trained for their load. To take an aerial photograph, Neubronner carried a pigeon to a location up to about [...] from its home, where it was equipped with a camera and released. The bird, keen to be relieved of its burden, would typically fly home on a direct route, at a height of [...] A <b>pneumatic</b> <b>system</b> in the camera controlled the time delay before a photograph was taken. To accommodate the burdened pigeon, the dovecote had a spacious, elastic landing board and a large entry hole.|$|E
500|$|The VB-13, redesignated ASM-A-1 in 1948, was {{developed}} under the project code MX-674. It had an annular wing around the midsection of its body, mounted near the weapon's center of gravity. At {{the rear of}} the bomb was an octagonal tail surface containing the Razon control surfaces. Intended to be carryed by the Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber, the Tarzon bomb used the combination of AN/ARW-38 [...] command link transmitter on the B-29 and an AN/URW-2 [...] receiver on the Tarzon to provide manual command guidance of range and azimuth. [...] This was done with visual tracking of the bomb's course, aided by a flare mounted in the tail of the weapon.

[...] It was successfully demonstrated on 25 July 1837. [...] This was a similar application to the Liverpool project. [...] The carriages were detached at Camden Town and travelled under gravity into Euston.

2500|$|The actual {{engraving}} {{is traditionally}} {{done by a}} combination of pressure and manipulating the work-piece. The traditional [...] "hand push" [...] process is still practiced today, but modern technology has brought various mechanically assisted engraving systems. Most pneumatic engraving systems require an air source that drives air through a hose into a handpiece, which resembles a traditional engraving handle in many cases, that powers a mechanism (usually a piston). The air is actuated by either a foot control (like a gas pedal or sewing machine) or newer palm / hand control. This mechanism replaces either the [...] "hand push" [...] effort or the effects of a hammer. The internal mechanisms move at speeds up to 15,000 strokes per minute, thereby greatly reducing the effort needed in traditional hand engraving. These types of pneumatic systems are used for power assistance only and do not guide or control the engraving artist. One of the major benefits of using a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>system</b> for hand engraving is the reduction of fatigue and decrease in time spent working.|$|E
