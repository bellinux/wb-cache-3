40|$|The {{compression}} of biomass {{is essential for}} facilitating transport and storage. Biomass, like wood, landscape refuse, straw and hay, is mostly compressed with a <b>press</b> <b>moulding</b> <b>machine</b> because of continuous operation which results in high capacities. The working principle of <b>press</b> <b>moulding</b> <b>machines</b> is based on friction of the material with the compression chamber. Higher friction means more compression but also results in high energy consumption for pushing the material out of the chamber. Studies show that the actual compression energy is less than 50 % of the total required energy of the compression process. This low energy efficiency is inherent to the current design of <b>press</b> <b>moulding</b> <b>machines</b> in agriculture and allows for optimizing the process. High forces are needed for the compression and the transportation of the biomaterial and thus the metal work {{has to be very}} solid. A tractor driving mobile <b>press</b> <b>moulding</b> <b>machines</b> then requires a lot of energy for off-road transportation. This research will found the development of new balers with higher energy efficiency and a lighter construction and will consist of two parts. The first and biggest part will model the interaction between the baler and the biomaterial in the compression chamber. This will result in a three dimensional dynamic finite element model that correlates the applied forces with the density of the biomass. The (time dependent) inputs of the compression process consist of machine and crop parameters together with the settings of the machine. Literature, lab research and fieldwork will explore the dependency of the model to the crops. The model validation will be done on the baler that is currently present at the lab. The second part of this research will show the advantages of a model-based optimization and will show the power of in-silico design optimization. This part will combine insights and expertise from experienced drivers with the modelling to eventually determine new machine parameters. The optimization will aim to minimize the work for transportation of the compressed biomaterial in the compression chamber while compressing till 200 kg/m³. Mechanical adaptations and suggestions for alternative control algorithms will be validated in the field with a large square baler to evaluate the optimal, theoretical efficiency in practice. nrpages: 174 status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{steadily}} {{growth of}} Wood Plastic Composite (WPC) in exterior applications resulted {{a need to}} understand their durability. In Malaysia, the durability of WPC is not only affected by mold and decay fungi as biodegradation agents but also due the termites attack. Therefore, this study was carried out to investigate the durability of WPC produced from different wood fine loadings (60, 65 and 70 %) and MAPP (1, 2, 3 and 4 %) concentration. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the optimum WPC formulation associate with higher durability against biodegradation agents. Commercial polypropylene, wood fines and coupling agent premixed in dumper mixer for 30 min prior to extrusion process at temperature of 190 °C using 110 mm counter-rotating twin-screw extruder. The premixed raw materials were then subjected to injection moulded using 40 ton <b>press</b> <b>moulding</b> <b>machine</b> and <b>pressed</b> into size of 30 mmx 30 mm and 3 mm thick board. Biological durability tests were carried out according to ASTM D 4445 for mold, ASTM method D 2017 for decay fungi and ASTM D 3345 for termites. From the result, 70 % wood fine loading showed significantly lower durability due to the insufficient encapsulation of wood fine with polymer matrix. Higher percentage of coupling agent (MAPP) used in the WPC boards will provide higher durability of WPC. Conclusively, the optimum formulation for WPC i. e., 4 % MAPP and 60 % wood fine loading gave the highest protection against mold, decay fungi and termites...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} number of companies producing wood-plastic composite for structural applications. However, wood plastic composite (WPC) require solving two major constraints; technique and formulation before their design value for structural application can be determined. This study focused on solving the two major constraints by employed injection moulding method to produce WPC and using different commercial available coupling agents at different percentage to produce WPC. The effect of wood to plastic ratio was also evaluated on WPC produced using the coupling agents that gave highest bending properties. Commercial polypropylene wood fine and coupling agents premixed in dumper mixer for 30 minutes prior to extrusion process at temperature of 190 oC using 110 mm counter-rotating twin-screw extruder. The WPC boards with size of 150 mm x 150 mm x 3 mm were then injection moulded by 40 -ton <b>press</b> <b>moulding</b> <b>machine.</b> From the result, WPC produced from coupling agents Exxelor PO 1020 at 4 % significantly performed better in bending properties. Further study {{on the effect of}} Exxelor PO 1020 percentage and the wood to plastic ratio showed that, WPC with 65 % wood fine performed significantly better in MOR and MOE than other type of WPCs. WPC with 60 % wood fine had significantly lower thickness swelling and water absorption compared to those 65 % and 70 % wood fine WPC. Conclusively, WPC with 65 % wood fine is optimum content for WPC to produce from injection moulded method. Higher coupling agent percentage used in WPC formulation gave higher bending properties...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} was to present results of {{researches}} concerned to predestining quality of polymer parts created by injection moulding method. The estimation of structural solution quality was made {{on the grounds of the}} injection moulding computer simulation. Results of studies were compared with predictions presented in professional literature. Design/methodology/approach: Series of injection moulding computer simulations were carried out for different structural solutions of chosen polypropylene part.
