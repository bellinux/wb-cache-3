40|$|Emerging economies, {{especially}} those in Asia-Pacific, are growing at a rapid pace and are demanding natural resources in greater quantities than ever before. As a leading resource exporter, Canada benefits from increased demand, which has boosted the national economy and has helped contribute to a westward shift in both population and economic power. These socio-economic developments continue to impact Canadian trade priorities, and have contributed to a regional shift and changing inter-provincial dynamics. Despite these changes, {{there has been little}} transformation regarding provincial inclusion in federal decision-making related to international trade. While many provinces have worked within their own jurisdiction to undertake trade missions and establish foreign trade offices, their involvement in trade negotiations or decisions regarding Canada’s <b>trade</b> <b>agenda</b> remains limited. Specifically, the federal government continues to maintain tight control over trade policy, despite the growing complexity of trade agreements and the importance of provincial involvement.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years of democracy, {{there has been}} a {{strategic}} reorientation of South Africa's trade policy. In the early 1990 s, the postapartheid state undertook extensive tariff reform, driven by its multilateral and regional commitments, as well as unilateral liberalisation consistent with the austere macro-economic agenda of the time. By the second decade of democracy, an institutionalised industrial policy designed to strengthen and diversify South Africa's productive capabilities had come to determine and shape South Africa's external <b>trade</b> <b>agenda</b> and negotiations. This more strategic trade policy orientation has required the preservation and expansion of policy space in bilateral, regional and multilateral agreements, and more novel approaches to South-South economic cooperation. There was also a fundamental shift in thinking on regional integration away from a conventional market-led model premised on the European Union's experience, to a 'developmental integration' approach that concurrently prioritises market integration, infrastructure development and structural economic transformation This article critically reviews how South Africa's trade policy and negotiating agenda have been recalibrated as instruments of industrial policy over the two post-apartheid decades. The article concludes with some observations about the future direction of South Africa's <b>trade</b> <b>agenda</b> during the third decade of democracy. [URL]...|$|R
