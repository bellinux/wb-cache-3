Increasingly, however, networks and infrastructures are becoming active components that contribute directly to application behavior. Amongst the various problems that this presents {{is the question}} of how such active infrastructures should be programmed.

Its programming model is organized in terms of properties that actively contribute to the functionality and behavior of the documents to which they are attached. This paper discusses active properties and their use as a programming model for active infrastructures.

The system provides a unique solution to centralize and keep actual most common and widely used information {{as a part of}} the eGovernment. The basic registers are the central information source for information systems of public authorities. In October 2014, the Czech government approved the conception of The Strategy for the Development of the Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the Czech Republic to 2020 (GeoInfoStrategy) that serves as a basis for the NSDI. The paper describes the challenges in building the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) in the Czech Republic with focus on the fundamental spatial data and related basic registers. The GeoInfoStrategy should also contribute to increasing of the competitiveness of the economy. Therefore the paper also reflects the Directive 2014 / 61 /EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on measures to reduce the cost of deploying high-speed electronic communication networks.

40|$|In many cases, {{application-level}} measurements can be {{the only}} way for an application to evaluate and adapt to the performance offered by the underlying networks. Applications perceive heterogeneous networking environments spanning over multiple administrative domains as "black boxes" being inaccessible for lower-level measurement instrumentation. However, application-level measurements can be inaccurate and differ significantly from the lower-level ones, amongst others due to the influence of the protocol stacks. In this paper we quantify and discuss such differences using the Distributed <b>Passive</b> Measurement <b>Infrastructure</b> (DPMI), with Measurement Points (MPs) instrumented with DAG 3. 5 E cards for the reference link-level measurements. We shed light on various impacts on timestamp accuracy of application-level measurements. Moreover, we quantify the accuracy of generating traffic with constant inter-packet-times (IPTs). The latter is essential for an accurate emulation of application-level streaming traffic and thus for obtaining realistic end-to-end performance measurements...|$|R
40|$|Derailments of trains {{often occur}} {{due to the}} wheel-rail contact failure caused by {{the impact of the}} trains with road {{vehicles}} at road-rail crossings. Frontal collisions of passenger trains onto stuck road vehicles occur frequently at such road-rail crossings even where active warning systems are installed. Such collisions are often fatal and cause significant damages to vehicles and the infrastructure especially when they incur derailments. Innovations in <b>passive</b> railway <b>infrastructure</b> designs for mitigating the severity of collision induced derailments are rare. This paper presents a formulation for a passive road-rail crossing involving stiffened edges of the raised road pavement to minimise the risk of failure of wheel–rail contact using a nonlinear three-dimensional multibody dynamics model. Severe derailment scenarios of trains passing through the passive and normal road-rail crossings have been analysed and presented. The innovative design of the road-rail crossing with passive track structure presented in the paper is shown to reduce the failure of the wheel-rail contact and hence the train-truck frontal collision derailment potential...|$|R

40|$|Passive network {{measurement}} through packet trace {{collection is}} an important technique for understanding the fundamental behavior of increasingly complex computer networks. Our research aims at exploring a next generation of distributed and high-performance <b>passive</b> measurement <b>infrastructure.</b> The challenges of such a system lie in the large amounts of measurement data that are generated through monitoring of Gigabit links {{and the need for}} complex processing to extract relevant information. To alleviate these problems, we have developed a network processor based packet capture system that can preprocess packet traces on the measurement node before storing the trace in a database. The network processor implements several important functions: (1) variable-length protocol header parsing, (2) prefix-preserving address anonymization, and (3) online statistics collection. To support online anonymization at Gigabit link speed, we have developed a new algorithm that outperforms existing solutions by two orders of magnitude. This anonymization algorithm employs top-hashing and subtree replication to replace online cryptographic computations with simple lookup operations.

40|$|Many {{applications}} and telecommunications services in future high-speed networks will require {{some form of}} multipoint communication. The problems associated with providing network support for multipoint communication have been widely studied within {{a number of different}} networking contexts. As current network technologies evolve to an alloptical, largely <b>passive</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> these problems take on new significance and raise a number of challenging issues that require novel solutions. We consider the problem of supporting multipoint communication at the media access control (MAC) layer of broadcast-and-select Wavelength Division Multiplexed (WDM) networks. In this environment, bandwidth consumption and channel utilization arise as two conflicting objectives in the design of scheduling algorithms for multicast traffic. We present a new technique for the transmission of multicast packets which is based on the concept of a virtual receiver. This is a set of physical receivers which behave identically in terms of tuning. We focus on the problem of optimally selecting the virtual receivers, and prove that it is NP-complete. We then present four heuristics of varying degrees of complexity for obtaining virtual receivers that provide a good balance between the tw...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: In recent years, many {{municipalities}} {{have made}} investments in fiber to the home/building (FTTH/B) infrastructures {{to enhance the}} digital future of their local communities. This paper aims to propose a business model for managing these municipal FTTH/B networks. The paper also seeks to form {{a part of the}} discussion on the business, social and policy implications of municipal involvement in physical broadband infrastructures. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reviews the international experience in municipal FTTH projects and identifies the best practices. Greece is then used as a case study due to the country's strategic plans to create efficient broadband infrastructures in the periphery of the country. Finally, the municipal business model is examined on three premises: the extent of horizontal integration; the degree of vertical integration; and the appropriate form of ownership. Findings: The <b>passive</b> <b>infrastructure</b> model applied within the model presented has strong potentials to ensure fair and open competition. The proposed business model exhibits substantial benefits for the telecommunications industry, the local communities and the managing company. It could become an effective policy tool for future regulation, broadband universal service framework, socially optimal investments and social inclusion. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the international debates regarding the adoption of the ""highway"" model (""open access"") versus ""vertical integration"" and the suitability of public-private partnership (PPP) as a method for developing and operating FTTH/B networks. It also contributes to the discussion about the implications of the public sector's involvement in broadband infrastructure development. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|E
