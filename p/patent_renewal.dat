In addition, the utilization of EPO-route <b>patent</b> <b>renewal</b> records in our study corrects the possible data inconsistancy problem in Pakes (1986). Estimation results indicate a highly skewed distribution of patent values in all three countries, as found by Pakes (1986).

40|$|Firms {{and governments}} spend {{billions of dollars}} on R&D every year. To {{increase}} social welfare, the results of R&D must be commercialized so that consumers can benefit from improved products and lower prices. One measure of R&D output is patents; however, most patent databases contain no information on whether patents have been commercialized, i. e., whether innovations have been introduced in the market. This paper applies a new method to identify innovations in patent databases by relating traditional patent quality indicators (<b>patent</b> <b>renewal,</b> patent equivalents and forward citations) to patent commercialization variables. For this purpose, I use a unique database on Swedish patents that includes information on whether patents are commercialized and whether the commercialization is profitable. The estimations show that commercialization is strongly positively correlated with both <b>patent</b> <b>renewal</b> and patent equivalents but only moderately positively correlated with forward citations. Further, successful innovations are most positively related to <b>patent</b> <b>renewal.</b> Based on the traditional patent quality indicators and estimated parameters in the model, probabilities of commercialization and successful innovations can be predicted. The developed parameters may be used to identify innovations across sectors and regions in other patent databases...|$|E
40|$|Plant Breeders Rights (PBRs) are sui generis IPRs {{intended}} to promote plant variety creation. Two characteristics distinguish PBRs from patents: {{the research and}} the farmers' exemptions.

This model extends previous models of <b>patents</b> <b>renewals</b> by allowing the use of PBRs-specific variables. It is argued that simple tests on the coefficients associated with key PBRs-specific variables can provide insights into the impact of the two exemption rules. Implementation to PBRs in France over the period 1973 – 2011 for six major crops suggests that neither the farmers' exemption nor the research exemption have a clear-cut effect on the private value of PBRs.

The private value of European patent in the pharmacertical and the electronic industries is examined. It is found that pharmacertical patents are endowed with higher initial returns, and their holders seek protection in more countries than those of electronic patents.

The intertwining of these dimensions (the geographical scope of protection may vary over time) makes their analysis complex, as any measure along one dimension requires an arbitrary choice on the second. This paper proposes a new indicator of patent value, the Scope-Year index, combining the two dimensions. The index is computed for patents filed at the EPO from 1980 to 1996 and validated in its member states. It shows that the average value of patent filings has increased in the early eighties but has constantly decreased from the mid-eighties until the mid nineties, despite the institutional expansion of the EPO.

40|$|In {{my thesis}} I develop a {{theoretical}} model of interdependent choices and an estimation strategy which I apply to model <b>patent</b> <b>renewal.</b> The {{model and the}} estimation are not confined to my application, but rather can have other applications in which firms or people are making strategic and simultaneous decisions. Chapter 1 is the introduction which contains {{a brief description of}} the structure of the thesis. Chapter 2 provides a literature review of studies that have focused on spatial dependence with discrete choice dependent variables; recent contributions include Pinkse and Slade (1998), LeSage (2000), Kelejian and Prucha (2001), Beron and Vijverberg (2004), and Wang et al. (2009). A major difficulty in the estimation of spatially dependent discrete choice models is computational intensity. Chapter 3 is a Monte Carlo study that investigates the small sample properties of an estimator for spatially dependent discrete choice models which is computationally simple. The analogue of a linear probability can be formulated as a spatial autoregressive Cliff and Ord (1973, 1981) -type model. The sets of Monte Carlo experiments show that the parameters of the model can be estimated without bias using a spatial 2 SLS estimator. Chapter 4 is a study is on the determinants of <b>patent</b> <b>renewal,</b> using US patents for Computer Hardware and Software granted between 1994 and 1997. Patent protection is important in that it encourages innovation by allowing firms to rely on patents to appropriate the returns to their R&D efforts. Returns to patents are modeled to depend on the firm's willingness to pay the <b>patent</b> <b>renewal</b> fees by, e. g., Harhoff et al. (2003), Serrano (2006), and Bessen (2008, 2009), and typically ignored potential interdependences in the decision making. Liu et al. (2008) showed that <b>patent</b> <b>renewal</b> was more likely if the patent was part of a firm's sequence of citing patents. I elaborate on their result and formulate a model in which the decision to renew a patent is dependent on the decisions of other firms to renew technologically similar patents. The theoretical model implies for the probability to renew a patent to depend on the probabilities to renew other patents, where the extent of interdependence is modeled based on a measure of similarity for patents. By making use of the estimation strategy from Chapter 3, I find that indeed the decision to renew a patent is dependent on the decision to renew related patents. Results in the literature which ignored this interdependence may hence suffer from specification biases. One plausible explanation for the interdependence I find is defensive patenting in the form of patent fencing, patent blocking and patent thickets. In the latter case, litigation and negotiation can impose high costs to society and their anticipation can lead to a hold up problem, which could deter investment in R&D...|$|E

We also explore the extent to which differences in IP management practices at universities may have an impact on the validity and robustness of possible indicators. Our observations from four UK universities indicate that there are considerable differences between universities as to how they approach the IP management process, which in turn has implications for valuing patents and how they track activity in this area.

40|$|In many {{countries}} holders of patents must pay an annual renewal fee {{in order to}} keep their patents in force. This paper uses data on the proportion of patents renewed, and the renewal fees faced by, post World War II cohorts of patents in France, the United Kingdom, and Germany, in conjunction with a model of <b>patent</b> holders' <b>renewal</b> decisions, to estimate the returns earned from holding patents in these countries. Since patents are often applied for at a nearly stage in the innovation process, the model allows agents to be uncertain about the sequence of returns that will be earned if the patent is kept inforce.

The estimates enable {{a detailed description of the}} evolution of the distribution of returns earned from holding patents over their life spans,and calculations of both; the annual returns earned from holding the patents still in force (or the patent stocks) in the alternative countries, and the distribution of the discounted value of returns earned from holding the patents in a cohort. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{economic}} {{slowdown in the}} 70 s in Latin America and Japan in the late 90 s, generated a growing skepticism {{about the role of}} industrial policy in the process of economic development. Yet, new considerations have emerged over the recent period, which invite us to revisit the issue. This paper argues that sectoral state aids tend to foster productivity, productivity growth, and product innovation to a larger extent when it targets more competitive sectors and when it is not concentrated on one or a small number of firms in the sector. Using a theoretical framework in which two firms may choose either to operate in the same "higher-growth" sector or in different, "lower-growth" sector. We use a panel of medium and large Chinese enterprises for the period 1998 through 2007 to test for complementarity between competition and industrial policy. A main implication from our analysis is that the debate on industrial policy should no longer be for or against having such a policy. As it turns out, sectoral policies are being implemented {{in one form or another}} by a large number of countries worldwide, starting with China. Rather, the issue should be on how to design and govern sectoral policies in order to make them more competition-friendly and therefore more growth-enhancing. application fees; competition; industrial policy; innovation and productivity; intellectual property policy; <b>patent</b> system; <b>renewal</b> fees...|$|R
