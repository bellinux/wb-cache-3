5|$|Although all {{subspecies}} of <b>painted</b> <b>turtle</b> eat both {{plants and}} animals, their specific diets vary.|$|E
5|$|The hatchling's {{ability to}} survive winter in the nest has allowed the <b>painted</b> <b>turtle</b> to extend its range further north than any other American turtle. The <b>painted</b> <b>turtle</b> is genetically adapted to survive {{extended}} periods of subfreezing temperatures with blood that can remain supercooled and skin that resists penetration from ice crystals in the surrounding ground. The hardest freezes nevertheless kill many hatchlings.|$|E
5|$|The midland <b>painted</b> <b>turtle</b> eats mostly aquatic {{insects and}} both {{vascular}} and non-vascular plants.|$|E
5|$|<b>Painted</b> <b>turtles</b> defend {{themselves}} by kicking, scratching, biting, or urinating. In contrast to land tortoises, <b>painted</b> <b>turtles</b> can right themselves {{if they are}} flipped upside down.|$|R
25|$|In the West, several predators of youngling <b>painted</b> <b>turtles</b> {{have been}} {{introduced}} into waters where they never roamed before: bass, snapping turtles, and bullfrogs. Examination of bullfrogs and bass in Montana shows they are consuming few <b>painted</b> <b>turtles.</b> Snapping turtles may have more impact and, in Oregon, aggressive trapping {{has been done to}} remove them.|$|R
5|$|In the West, human-introduced bass, bullfrogs, and {{especially}} snapping turtles, {{have increased the}} predation of hatchlings. Outside the Southeast, where sliders are native, released pet red-eared slider turtles increasingly compete with <b>painted</b> <b>turtles.</b> In cities, increased urban predators (raccoons, canines, and felines) may impact <b>painted</b> <b>turtles</b> by eating their eggs.|$|R
5|$|The <b>painted</b> <b>turtle</b> (C.picta) is {{the only}} species in the genus Chrysemys. The parent family for Chrysemys is Emydidae: the pond turtles. Emydidae is split into two sub families; Chrysemys {{is part of the}} Deirochelyinae (Western Hemisphere) branch. The four {{subspecies}} of the <b>painted</b> <b>turtle</b> are the eastern (C.p.picta), midland (C.p.marginata), southern (C.p.dorsalis), and western (C.p.bellii).|$|E
5|$|The <b>painted</b> <b>turtle</b> is {{sometimes}} eaten {{but is not}} highly regarded as food, as even the largest subspecies, the western <b>painted</b> <b>turtle,</b> is inconveniently small and larger turtles are available. Schools frequently dissect painted turtles, which are sold by biological supply companies; specimens often come from the wild but may be captive-bred. In the Midwest, turtle racing is popular at summer fairs.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{subspecies}} of <b>painted</b> <b>turtle</b> intergrade (blend together) at range boundaries {{they are}} distinct within {{the hearts of}} their ranges.|$|E
2500|$|For {{commercial}} harvesting, collectors {{use either}} basking traps or hoop traps. The basking trap is a floating enclosures with sloping sides and a basking surface. Turtles {{are able to}} climb up the sloping sides onto the basking surface, but then when they jump off into the center, they can't get back out. Hoop traps are cylindrical mesh traps with a funnel opening. Hoop traps are submerged and turtles are attracted by bait. In Minnesota, trappers say that they prefer basking traps to target <b>painted</b> <b>turtles</b> and hoop traps for [...] "meat" [...] turtles (snapping turtles and softshell turtles). Minnesota harvest records also show a clear pattern of most <b>painted</b> <b>turtles</b> coming from basking traps and most softshell and snapping turtles from hoop traps. Three quantitative studies of basking traps also show they are more efficient than baited hoop traps for trapping <b>painted</b> <b>turtles.</b> Despite the many hours of night and cloudiness when the basking traps do not lure <b>turtles,</b> the <b>painted</b> <b>turtle's</b> drive to bask is so powerful, that on a per-day basis, these traps are twice as effective. Or, possibly, the basking traps are more effective since <b>painted</b> <b>turtles</b> frequently escape back out the funnel of hoop traps.|$|R

5|$|Another Canadian {{admirer of}} the <b>painted</b> <b>turtle</b> is Jon Montgomery, {{who won the}} 2010 Olympic gold medal in {{skeleton}} (a form of sled) racing, while wearing a <b>painted</b> <b>turtle</b> painting on the crown of his helmet, prominently visible when he slid downhill. Montgomery, who also iconically tattoed his chest with a maple-leaf, explained his visual promotion of the turtle, {{saying that he had}} assisted one to cross the road. BC Hydro referred to Montgomery's action when describing its own sponsorship of conservation research for the turtle in British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|David E. Starkey and {{collaborators}} advanced a {{new view}} of the subspecies in 2003. Based on {{a study of the}} mitochondrial DNA, they rejected the glacial development theory and argued that the southern <b>painted</b> <b>turtle</b> should be elevated to a separate species, C. dorsalis, while the other subspecies should be collapsed into one and not differentiated. However, this proposition was largely unrecognized because successful breeding between all subspecies was documented wherever they overlapped. Nevertheless, in 2010, the IUCN recognized both C. dorsalis and C.p.dorsalis as valid names for the southern <b>painted</b> <b>turtle.</b>|$|E

5|$|Originally {{described}} in 1783 by Johann Gottlob Schneider as Testudo picta, the <b>painted</b> <b>turtle</b> was called Chrysemys picta first by John Edward Gray in 1855. The four subspecies were then recognized: the eastern by Schneider in 1783, the western by Gray in 1831, and the midland and southern by Louis Agassiz in 1857.|$|E
5|$|A cold-blooded reptile, the <b>painted</b> <b>turtle</b> regulates its {{temperature}} {{through its}} environment, notably by basking. All ages bask for warmth, often alongside {{other species of}} turtle. Sometimes more than 50individuals are seen on one log together.

5|$|A reptile {{becomes the}} {{official}} state symbol {{after it is}} voted in by the state legislature. Although many states require the bill to be signed by the governor, in some the enabling act is a resolution (legislature vote only).

5|$|<b>Painted</b> <b>turtle</b> pet-keeping {{requirements}} {{are similar to}} those of the red-eared slider. Keepers are urged to provide them with adequate space and a basking site, and water that is regularly filtered and changed. According to Petco, the animals are described as being somewhat unsuitable for children as they do not enjoy being held. Hobbyists have kept turtles alive for decades.|$|E
5|$|The <b>painted</b> <b>turtle</b> hunts along water bottoms. It quickly juts {{its head}} {{into and out}} of {{vegetation}} to stir potential victims out into the open water, where they are pursued. The turtle holds large prey in its mouth and tears the prey apart with its forefeet. It also consumes plants and skims {{the surface of the water}} with its mouth open to catch small particles of food.|$|E
50|$|The river has a {{surprising}} diversity of <b>turtles,</b> including <b>painted</b> <b>turtles,</b> snapping turtles, Blanding's turtles, musk turtles and map turtles. The last four are considered species at risk, probably because nesting beaches have been degraded by human settlement.|$|R

25|$|As of 2009, <b>painted</b> <b>turtles</b> faced {{virtually}} unlimited harvesting in Arkansas, Iowa, Missouri, Ohio, and Oklahoma. Since then, Missouri disallowed the harvest.|$|R
5|$|The {{spotted turtle}} and <b>painted</b> <b>turtle</b> {{are similar in}} {{appearance}} to the bog turtle. The bog turtle is distinguishable from any other species of turtle by the distinctively colored blotch on its neck. A major difference {{between it and the}} spotted turtle is that the bog turtle has no coloration on the upper shell, unlike the latter species.|$|E
5|$|The western painted turtle's {{consumption}} {{of plants and}} animals changes seasonally. In early summer, 60% of its diet comprises insects. In late summer, 55% includes plants. Of note, the western <b>painted</b> <b>turtle</b> aids in the dispersal of white water-lily seeds. The turtle consumes the hard-coated seeds, which remain viable after passing through the turtle, and disperses them through its feces.|$|E
5|$|According to a trade data study, painted turtles {{were the}} second most popular pet turtles after red-eared sliders in the early 1990s. As of 2010, most U.S. states allow, but discourage, <b>painted</b> <b>turtle</b> pets, {{although}} Oregon forbids keeping them as pets, and Indiana prohibits their sale. U.S. federal law prohibits sale or transport of any turtle less than , to limit human contact to salmonella. However, a loophole for scientific samples allows some small turtles to be sold, and illegal trafficking also occurs.|$|E
50|$|The spotted turtle's range {{overlaps}} that of {{many other}} turtles.
