25|$|The process uses a cobalt–manganese–bromide catalyst. The bromide source can be sodium bromide, {{hydrogen}} bromide or tetrabromoethane where bromine {{functions as a}} regenerative source of free radicals. In this process, acetic acid is the solvent and oxygen from compressed air is the oxidant. The combination of bromine and acetic acid {{is found to be}} highly corrosive and hence the equipment is lined with titanium. A feed mixture containing <b>p-xylene,</b> acetic acid, the catalyst system, and compressed air is fed to a reactor. The oxidation of the methyl group takes place in two steps where <b>p-xylene</b> is converted to p-toluic acid and the byproduct undesirable 4-carboxybenzaldehyde along with crude p-toluic acid. It is further purified to obtain the p-toluic acid with the removal of the 4-carboxybenzaldehyde using crystallization, centrifugation and filtration. 98% of the <b>p-xylene</b> is reacted to give more than 95mol% TPA.

Growth of fungi and bacteria from soils around Rothera Research Station (Adelaide Island, Antarctic Peninsula) was assessed in the presence of ten separate aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons [marine gas oil (MGO), dodecane, hexadecane, benzoic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, toluene, phenol, biphenyl, naphthalene and m- and <b>p-xylenes</b> with ethylbenzene]. Aromatic hydrocarbons inhibited soil microbial growth more than aliphatic hydrocarbons. Soil microorganisms from a moss patch, where little previous impact or hydrocarbon contamination had occurred, were less tolerant of hydrocarbons than those from high impact sites. Fungal growth rates of Mollisia sp., Penicillium commune, Mortierella sp., Trichoderma koningii, Trichoderma sp. and Phoma herbarum were assessed in the presence of hydrocarbons. Generally, aromatic hydrocarbons inhibited or stopped hyphal extension, though growth rates increased with some aliphatic hydrocarbons.

Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the presence of the surfactant decreases the thermal stability of the PMO.

The adsorption kinetics study indicated an adsorption equilibrium time of 50 min and also showed that the data best fitted the pseudo-first order kinetic model. The intraparticle diffusion model was also tested and pointed to the occurrence of such process in all cases.
