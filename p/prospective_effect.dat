After reviewing some key indicators of the country’s economy, the Article presents a comparison between a Washington and Beijing consensus, contrasting ideological meanings between these two consensuses, and then explores the measure of the Beijing consensus as a variety of capitalisms. By doing so the Article reveals the broader role of Beijing’s export-oriented strategy and its eventual relation to international capital’s industrial transformation and the <b>prospective</b> <b>effects</b> of a Beijing consensus. The Article concludes by presenting a prospectus of the Beijing consensus as a variety of capitalisms in the post-global financial crisis era.

40|$|A {{substantial}} {{subset of}} patent opinions from the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals functions in a wholly different manner from ordinary judicial opinions: they have strong retroactive <b>effects</b> with weak <b>prospective</b> <b>effects.</b> All Federal Circuit opinions have strong retroactive effects because issued patents and pending applications rarely can be modified. The Federal Circuit decisions apply in full to these patents and applications, {{even though they}} were prepared without the benefit of the rulings. In contrast, many of these opinions have almost no <b>prospective</b> <b>effects.</b> Patent law provides tremendous linguistic flexibility to patent drafters, which can be used to avoid the holdings of many (but not all) opinions. Patent drafters can freely choose any words to describe and claim the invention in the patent application. Patentees carefully draft new applications, aware of the decisions, to avoid their holdings. If the Federal Circuit holds that a certain phrase necessitates a bad result, patent lawyers substitute equivalent uncontaminated language in its place in future applications. The <b>prospective</b> <b>effects</b> of these opinions are muted because of the linguistic flexibility in drafting applications. Issued patents cannot be effectively modified; consequently, they are strongly affected by Federal Circuit decisions. There are substantial costs to the Federal Circuit’s actions. First, patent prosecutors are excessively cautious and spend extra time drafting claims and patent specifications to lower the risk of future changes in the law. This increases costs while still not substantially eliminating the problem. More troubling, the retroactive opinions weaken the incentive to innovate because the added uncertainty in the procurement process makes patent rights insecure. It thereby diminishes the value of patents. As their value decreases, patents cannot fully advance technological progress, as the Constitution urges. A counterintuitive solution—reducing the use of precedential opinions—can mitigate the retroactivity problem...|$|R

5000|$|Gabriel J. Chin, Professor of Law at UC Davis School of Law, {{held the}} opinion that the term [...] "natural born" [...] is {{ambiguous}} and citizenship-granting authority {{has changed over the}} years. He notes that persons born outside the United States to U.S.-citizen parents have not always been born citizens. For example, foreign-born children of persons who became naturalized citizens between April 14, 1802 and 1854 were considered aliens. He also believed that children born in the Panama Canal Zone to at least one U.S. then-citizen between May 24, 1934, and August 4, 1937, when Congress granted citizenship to all such persons, were born without American citizenship. As a result, Chin argues, such persons (for constitutional and political purposes, most notably 2008 U.S. presidential candidate John McCain, born in the Canal Zone on August 28, 1936) may be considered [...] "natural born" [...] only if both parents were citizens. # Congress possesses the authority either#* to grant not only citizenship (as is undisputed) but the more specific status of a [...] "natural born" [...] citizen, with an affirmative answer raising the question of whether it can also act to remove that status (and thereby disqualify individuals from the Presidency through action short of stripping them of their citizenship),#*:or#* to issue [...] "declarations" [...] regarding the meaning of preexisting law (in this case, U.S. citizenship law between the aforementioned dates) and having binding authority, a claim likely to violate separation of powers given the Constitution's provisions in Article III that [...] "the judicial Power of the United States shall be vested in one supreme Court and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish" [...] (Section 1) and that [...] "the judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority" [...] (Section 2)#:and# the statute (currently codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1403(a)) - which states only that [...] "any person the above description is declared to be a citizen of the United States" [...] and neither#* expressly claims that its declaration (whether a grant or an interpretation) has retroactive rather than merely <b>prospective</b> <b>effect</b> (contrast the locution [...] "to have been a citizen of the United States birth")#*:nor#* in any way mentions [...] "natural born" [...] status (instead conferring or recognizing the preexistence only of [...] "citizenship" [...] generally) - #*:in fact grants or recognizes citizenship from birth, let alone status as a natural born citizen (to whatever extent the requirements of that status exceed those for citizenship from birth).|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} work–family conflict (WFC) and enrichment (WFE) {{in relation to}} job exhaustion and turnover intentions among long-term temporary (n = 384) and permanent (n = 430) workers. We used three-wave data collected among Finnish university employees in 3 consecutive years. The participants were either permanently or temporarily employed for the whole 3 -year period. The results showed that permanent employees reported both higher WFC and WFE during the follow-ups than temporary employees. Temporary workers reported higher job exhaustion and turnover intentions compared to permanent workers. Job contract functioned as a moderator: high WFC showed a <b>prospective</b> <b>effect</b> on increased turnover intentions in permanent employees.
