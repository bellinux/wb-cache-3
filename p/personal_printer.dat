50|$|Most {{printers}} {{other than}} line printers accept control characters or unique character sequences to control various printer functions. These may range from shifting from lower to upper case or from black to red ribbon on typewriter printers to switching fonts and changing character sizes and colors on raster printers. Early printer controls were not standardized, with each manufacturer's equipment having its own set. The IBM <b>Personal</b> <b>Printer</b> Data Stream (PPDS) became a commonly used command set for dot-matrix printers.|$|E
50|$|The {{personal}} computer, <b>personal</b> <b>printer</b> {{and color}} photocopier have served to democratize {{the means of}} production of artistamps. It is no coincidence that the early 1980s explosion in artistamp creation paralleled the development and widespread use of color photocopiers, and that a similar surge followed the ubiquity of personal computers and inexpensive color printers. Still, the lack of workable, widely available, cheap and accessible perforators have limited the number of artists who can create convincing simulcra of traditional perforated stamps.|$|E

50|$|The {{development}} and hyper-customization of the RepRap-based 3D printers {{has produced a}} new category of printers suitable for small business and consumer use. Manufacturers such as Solidoodle, Robo 3D, RepRapPro and Pirx 3D have introduced models and kits priced at less than $1,000, thousands less {{than they were in}} September 2012. Depending on the application, the print resolution and speed of manufacturing lies somewhere between a <b>personal</b> <b>printer</b> and an industrial printer. A list of printers with pricing and other information is maintained. Most recently delta robots, like the TripodMaker, have been utilized for 3D printing to increase fabrication speed further. For delta 3D printers, due to its geometry and differentiation movements, the accuracy of the print depends on the position of the printer head.|$|E
40|$|Abstract A {{one-step}} {{thick film}} printing {{process has been}} established for patterning hydrophobic polyvinyl chloride (PVC) substrate materials with hydrophilic cellulose ace-tate. The opposing patterned substrate materials are brought within close proximity utilizing spacer material of defined thickness. The parallel-plate configured devices are capable of supporting autonomous fluid transport through capillarity. Minimum attainable path widths of 313. 3 ± 17. 9 lm can be achieved utilizing an affordable <b>personal</b> <b>printer</b> for photomask generation. In addition, a theoretical model for this system predicting meniscus position {{as a function of}} time and system architecture is posed along with experimental data which is found to be in good agreement with the model. Lastly, the curvature of the surface is approximated and exploited for the determina-tion of the true pressure jump across the curved surface at the gas–liquid interface at all points on a discretized surface. The curvature associated pressure jump results are found to be consistent with the Laplace pressure approximation...|$|E
50|$|Full bleed is {{printing}} {{from one}} {{edge of the}} paper to the other without the standard borders by which most <b>personal</b> <b>printers</b> are limited. This is useful for printing brochures, posters, and other marketing materials. Often the paper is trimmed after printing to ensure the ink runs fully to the edge and does not stop short of it.|$|R

50|$|<b>Personal</b> <b>printers</b> are {{primarily}} designed to support individual users, {{and may be}} connected to only a single computer. These printers are designed for low-volume, short-turnaround print jobs, requiring minimal setup time to produce a hard copy of a given document. However, they are generally slow devices ranging from 6 to around 25 pages per minute (ppm), and the cost per page is relatively high. However, this is offset by the on-demand convenience. Some printers can print documents stored on memory cards or from digital cameras and scanners.|$|R

40|$|The recent {{emergence}} of <b>personal</b> 3 D <b>printers</b> (i. e., systems that cost $ 5, 000 or less) has engaged {{a new class}} of users including hobbyists, tinkerers, entrepreneurs, and do-it-yourselfers. Over 20, 000 <b>personal</b> 3 D <b>printers</b> were sold in 2011, and thus {{there is a need for}} users to understand the cost and performance of <b>personal</b> 3 D <b>printers</b> as compared to low-cost professional-grade machines (i. e., systems that cost between $ 5, 000 and $ 20, 000). The cost, process time, material usage, and dimensional accuracy was assessed for select <b>personal</b> 3 D <b>printers</b> and low-cost professional-grade systems. The study showed that the laminated object manufacturing (LOM) printer generated 80 % waste, which equaled five times the actual part weight. General observations were also made including the safety hazard posed by unprocessed UV curable resins and facility requirements such as ventilated workspace. Results from this study can aid inexperienced users of 3 D printers make educated decisions to buy the most suitable printer that meets their needs as well as to dissipate unrealistic expectations...|$|R

5000|$|The {{possible}} {{applications of}} Minecraft {{have been discussed}} extensively, especially {{in the fields of}} computer-aided design and education. In a panel at MineCon 2011, a Swedish developer discussed the possibility of using the game to redesign public buildings and parks, stating that rendering using Minecraft was much more user-friendly for the community, making it easier to envision the functionality of new buildings and parks. In 2012, a member of the Human Dynamics group at the MIT Media Lab, Cody Sumter, said that [...] "Notch hasn't just built a game. He's tricked 40 million people into learning to use a CAD program."

40|$|Ever since Clayton Christensen's 1997 book "The Innovator's Dilemma" on {{disruptive}} innovations, {{the theory}} has received considerable scholarly {{as well as}} business management attention, with some even calling it "groundbreaking". Its key premise - that entrant companies with products of inferior performance can displace established companies - {{continues to be a}} prominent subject of management and innovation research. Like any trailblazing theory, it has also stirred criticism and aroused alternative explanations, contributing to its ongoing evolution. There nevertheless exists a considerable amount of concrete examples in the literature of various products, companies and industries where an entrant company or product did indeed disrupt the established actors. Christensen (2000) found that such disruptive innovations tend to be smaller, simpler, cheaper, more reliable and convenient that established or preceding products, and still based on existing technologies. These characteristics bring us to view the recent proliferation of <b>personal</b> 3 D <b>printers</b> in a new light. Recent media attention has led some authors - and popular media - to consider 3 D printing as a new disruptive technology, even though the technology has existed for a good quarter of a century. Also, disruption is a relative phenomenon, meaning that there must be an established product to disrupt. However, the recent expiry of certain patents and the birth of an open-source 3 D printer project have led to the advent of a class of considerably low-priced, consumer-grade 3 D printers. These seem to fit Christensen's (2000) characteristics of a typical disruptive innovation remarkably well, yet the notion of <b>personal</b> 3 D <b>printers</b> as a potential disruptive innovation doesn't seem to have been researched in any detail and thus the knowledge on the phenomenon is scattered. The purpose of this case study is to study the proliferation of <b>personal</b> <b>printers</b> in detail and address whether they can indeed be considered a disruptive innovation. This entails studying e. g. the factors leading to their advent, the differences between the <b>personal</b> <b>printers</b> and entry-level industrial ones, business models, unit sales, prices, market shares and industry revenue. Based on Christensen's (2000) suggestion, also the development of personal 3 D printers' performance over time is charted and compared to entry-level industrial printers as well as assumed performance demands of the market. My results indicate that <b>personal</b> 3 D <b>printers</b> meet the general criteria for a (new-market) disruptive innovation, yet their proliferation has occurred in a fashion that doesn't cause immediate consequences for individual incumbent companies, even though the total 3 D printer market has no doubt been disrupted by the new product and new entrants. The case supports the view of significant market expansion {{as a result of a}} disruptive innovation's entry...|$|R
5000|$|The company's {{business}} model is {{to address the}} consumer market with a low cost, small form, simple to program unit. [...] According to one report, 56,000 <b>personal</b> 3D <b>printers</b> were shipped globally in 2012 and the market {{is expected to grow}} to close to 2 million units by 2018. [...] The Micro was described in October 2014 as [...] "one of the lowest-priced <b>personal</b> 3-D <b>printers</b> that you don't have to build yourself." [...] The form of the unit is a 7-inch cube weighing 2 pounds. [...] The initial Kickstarter price point of $299 has not been maintained, but increased to $349 by October 2014.

40|$|Paper {{has been}} used as an {{information}} medium for almost two thousand years. But during the past three decades, there has been a tremendous amount of {{growth in the number of}} digitally printed pages. Today, 200 billion pages are shifting to digital printing devices annually, driven by a number of fundamental changes in how people create, distribute, and consume content. Digital printers first came into their own as office and home printers, rendering documents and spreadsheets created by individuals on terminals and personal computers. In general, they are distinguished by their convenience (no manual prepress processes are necessary) and their ability to print 100 % variable content economically. Modern digital printers range from portable <b>personal</b> <b>printers,</b> to office printers and copiers, to digital presses that are over 60 feet long and print at 400 feet per minute...|$|R

50|$|These initial steps worked. IBM was in {{the black}} by 1994, turning a profit of $3 billion. Stabilization was not Gerstner's endgame - the {{restoration}} of IBM's once great reputation was. To do that, he needed to devise a winning business strategy. Over the next decade, Gerstner crafted a business model that shed commodity businesses and focused on high-margin opportunities. IBM divested itself of low margin industries (DRAM, IBM Network, <b>personal</b> <b>printers,</b> and hard drives). The company regained the business initiative by building upon the decision to keep the company whole - it unleashed a global services business that rapidly rose to become a leading technology integrator. Crucial to this success was the decision to become brand agnostic - IBM integrated whatever technologies the client required, {{even if they were}} from an IBM competitor. IBM augmented this services business with the 2002 acquisition of the consultancy division of PricewaterhouseCoopers for $3.5 billion US.|$|R
