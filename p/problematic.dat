5|$|Before public release, {{work units}} go through several quality {{assurance}} steps to keep <b>problematic</b> ones from becoming fully available. These testing stages include internal, beta, and advanced, before a final full release across Folding@home. Folding@home's work units are normally processed only once, {{except in the}} rare event that errors occur during processing. If this occurs for three different users, the unit is automatically pulled from distribution. The Folding@home support forum {{can be used to}} differentiate between issues arising from <b>problematic</b> hardware and bad work units.|$|E
5|$|Hemp oil, {{relatively}} low in emissions. Production is <b>problematic</b> {{in some countries}} because of its association with marijuana.|$|E
5|$|Inadvertent {{hunting or}} running of deer by coonhounds is {{particularly}} <b>problematic</b> for hunters, as hunting deer with dogs is illegal in most states.|$|E
5|$|Role playing: The client {{portrays a}} person or object that is <b>problematic</b> to him or her.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Navy 1956 {{tables were}} soon {{found to be}} <b>problematic</b> for dives deeper than 100fsw for longer than 2 to 4 hours.|$|E
5|$|The {{variation}} in titration curves when the amino acids can be grouped by category. With {{the exception of}} tyrosine, using titration to distinguish among hydrophobic amino acids is <b>problematic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Classification {{into higher}} taxa for these groups {{has been and}} remains <b>problematic.</b> A phylogenetic study {{suggests}} the Polyplacophora form a clade with a monophyletic Aplacophora. Additionally, it suggests a sister taxon relationship exists between the Bivalvia and the Gastropoda. Tentaculita may also be in Mollusca (see Tentaculites).|$|E
5|$|Conservation {{measures}} being undertaken include international cooperation, legal protection, research, monitoring, habitat management, {{education and}} the maintenance of captive flocks for propagation and reintroduction. Although the bird breeds well in the wild, it has proved much more <b>problematic</b> to get it to breed while in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Disaster Management: Identification of true {{victims of}} {{disasters}} is often <b>problematic</b> {{because there are}} infiltrators who {{take advantage of the}} absence of credible identification system to benefit {{at the expense of the}} affected ones. Data on a persons Lebanese Identity Card is used to establish whether they live in an area affected by a disaster to enable them to receive relief items.|$|E
5|$|Due to delays with {{delivery}} of jet engines {{and production of}} the XP-84A, the Thunderjet had undergone only limited flight testing by the time production P-84Bs began to roll out of the factory in 1947. In particular, the impact of wingtip tanks on aircraft handling was not thoroughly studied. This proved <b>problematic</b> later.|$|E
5|$|Each area of his output can {{be further}} {{subdivided}} by form or by hypothetical period of composition. Since dating Josquin's compositions is particularly <b>problematic,</b> with scholarly consensus only achieved on a minority of works, discussion here is by type.|$|E
5|$|In the 2010s, {{the novelty}} of the Pendolino has worn off and VR has even used the train in {{regional}} traffic between Oulu and Rovaniemi due to rail works in summer 2011. The <b>problematic</b> tilting mechanism was not used during winter 2010–2011 and the time benefit of the tilting was not {{taken into account in}} timetables of winter 2011–2012.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, lead's {{toxicity}} was recognized, {{and its use}} has since been phased out of many applications. Lead is a neurotoxin that accumulates in soft tissues and bones, damages the nervous system, and causes blood disorders. It is particularly <b>problematic</b> in children: even if blood levels are promptly normalized with treatment, permanent brain damage may result.|$|E
5|$|Multimedia {{support has}} been <b>problematic</b> in Debian {{regarding}} codecs threatened by possible patent infringements, without sources or under too restrictive licenses, and regarding technologies such as Adobe Flash. Even though packages with problems related to their distribution could go into the non-free area, software such as libdvdcss is not hosted at Debian.|$|E
5|$|On October 27 {{the company}} began buying back all its {{commercial}} paper, valued at around $3.3 billion, {{in an effort to}} calm investor fears about Enron's supply of cash. Enron financed the re-purchase by depleting its lines of credit at several banks. While the company's debt rating was still considered investment-grade, its bonds were trading at levels slightly less, making future sales <b>problematic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rising {{through the}} junior ranks, Karthik made his {{first-class}} debut in late-2002 for Tamil Nadu as a 17-year-old, and was dropped {{in his first}} season despite his healthy run-scoring because of his <b>problematic</b> glovework. He fought his way back into the team and after playing for India at the 2004 Under-19 World Cup, made his ODI and Test cricket debut in late 2004.|$|E
5|$|Sorce Keller, Marcello. “Italy in Music: A Sweeping (and Somewhat Audacious) Reconstruction of a 	<b>Problematic</b> Identity”, in Franco Fabbri e Goffredo Plastino (eds.), Made in Italy. Studies in Popular Music. London: Routledge, 2014, 17-28.|$|E
5|$|The Madagascar women's {{national}} football team is the FIFA recognised senior women's A team for Madagascar. The team played their first FIFA matches in 2015. The {{development of a}} national team {{in the country is}} <b>problematic</b> because of issues found on the continent and on the island, specifically the lack of popularity of women's football as a participation sport in Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|The McLaren M2B was the McLaren team's first Formula One racing car, {{used during}} the 1966 season. It was {{conceived}} in 1965 and preceded by the M2A development car. Designed by Robin Herd, the innovative but <b>problematic</b> Mallite material was used in its construction. The car was powered by Ford and Serenissima engines but both lacked power and suffered from reliability issues.|$|E
5|$|The Prosaurolophus-Saurolophus clade {{has been}} a <b>problematic</b> {{grouping}} when trying to place among hadrosaurines. Many skull features are similar to Edmontosaurus, while other are closer to Gryposaurus, so the group has been classified as close to both. However, the clade might be closer to Edmontosaurus, as the features are more numerous uniting them.|$|E
5|$|The bats {{were entirely}} digital (except in shots {{containing}} {{only one or}} two bats), as it was decided directing larger numbers of real bats on set would be <b>problematic.</b> Dead bats were scanned to create digital models. Locations and sets were recreated on the computer so the flying bats would not be superfluous once incorporated into the finished film.|$|E
5|$|The casting of Hopper, the film's villain, proved <b>problematic.</b> Lasseter's top {{choice was}} Robert De Niro, who {{repeatedly}} turned the part down, as did {{a succession of}} other actors. Kevin Spacey met John Lasseter at the 1995 Academy Awards and Lasseter asked Spacey {{if he would be}} interested in doing the voice of Hopper. Spacey was delighted and signed on immediately.|$|E
5|$|The {{journey was}} rich in {{scientific}} results. However, {{the relationship between}} the Forsters and Cook and his officers was often <b>problematic,</b> due to the elder Forster's fractious temperament as well as Cook's refusal to allow more time for botanical and other scientific observation. Cook refused scientists on his third journey after his experiences with the Forsters.|$|E
5|$|The larvae of the Macadamia leafminer (Acrocercops chionosema), a moth, burrow {{along and}} disfigure the waratah's leaves, and are mainly {{a problem in}} {{lowering}} the value of cut flower crops. More <b>problematic</b> is the larger caterpillar of another moth, the Macadamia twig girdler Macadamia twig girdler (Xylorycta luteotactella) which can burrow into and disfigure the developing flowerhead.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary control}} input that the rider can make {{is to apply}} a torque {{directly}} to the steering mechanism via the handlebars. Because of the bike's own dynamics, due to steering geometry and gyroscopic effects, direct position control over steering angle {{has been found to}} be <b>problematic.</b>|$|E
5|$|The words {{attachment}} {{style or}} pattern {{refer to the}} various types of attachment arising from early care experiences, called secure, anxious-ambivalent, anxious-avoidant, (all organized), and disorganized. Some of these styles are more <b>problematic</b> than others, and, although they are not disorders in the clinical sense, are sometimes discussed under the term 'attachment disorder'.|$|E
5|$|This issue, {{which became}} a serious {{bottleneck}} when traffic on the new expressway greatly exceeded expectations, was remedied beginning in 2001 {{with the construction of}} two flyovers to replace the <b>problematic</b> movements and the removal of the under-utilized connection from eastbound Mohawk Road to westbound Highway403. The $16 million project was completed in late 2002.|$|E
5|$|Warm air : Exposition {{of seeds}} to warm air (50 to 70°C, {{depending}} duration) kills B. rufimanus developing into the seeds {{at the same}} time it lowers water content. However, warmth can decrease germination rates of the seeds and degrade the visual aspect and the protein content of the seeds, which would be <b>problematic</b> for the seed market.|$|E
5|$|While many of {{the moves}} made by Grand Met were {{successful}} in generating additional sales and growth, the company continued to experience problems. While Fortune Magazine named CEO Gibbons as its Turnaround Champion for his success in reversing {{the fortunes of the}} company, several news outlets claimed that the changes he introduced were <b>problematic</b> because they deprived the company of valuable assets.|$|E
5|$|With 10 climatic regions, 14 soil {{regions and}} 11 {{distinct}} ecological regions, regional classification becomes <b>problematic</b> with differences in soils, topography, geology, rainfall, and {{plant and animal}} communities. One classification system divides Texas, in order from southeast to west, into the following: Gulf Coastal Plains, Interior Lowlands, Great Plains, and Basin and Range Province.|$|E
5|$|All serials in {{this season}} {{continue}} directly one after the other, tracing one single <b>problematic</b> voyage of the TARDIS crew. Despite the continuity, each serial is considered its own standalone story. This season also introduced the character of Harry Sullivan as a companion; this character was intended to undertake action scenes, during the period prior to Tom Baker being cast, when it was unclear how old the actor playing the new Doctor would be.|$|E
5|$|Authorities {{classify}} {{the species}} into {{three or four}} subspecies: B. m. musculus, the northern blue whale consisting of the North Atlantic and North Pacific populations, B. m. intermedia, the southern blue whale of the Southern Ocean, B. m. brevicauda, the pygmy blue whale found in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific, and the more <b>problematic</b> B. m. indica, the great Indian rorqual, which {{is also found in}} the Indian Ocean and, although described earlier, may be the same subspecies as B. m. brevicauda.|$|E
5|$|Because postmortem fetal {{extrusion}} is so rare, and occurs under highly idiosyncratic conditions {{regarding the}} individual and the ambient environment, this phenomenon has not been studied for possible applications to forensic investigation. Even if the study of postmortem fetal extrusion could lead to improved investigative methods, experimental research would be highly <b>problematic.</b> At present, forensic scientists have at their disposal an array of established techniques and procedures for a death investigation at the stages of decomposition when postmortem fetal extrusion typically occurs.|$|E
5|$|By 1986, {{the company}} was once again in serious {{financial}} trouble. During 1985 they had taken the show outside Quebec to a lukewarm response. In Toronto they performed {{in front of a}} 25% capacity crowd after not having enough money to properly market the show. Gilles Ste-Croix, dressed in a monkey suit, walked through downtown Toronto as a desperate publicity stunt. A later stop in Niagara Falls turned out to be equally <b>problematic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Debian 6.0 (Squeeze) was {{released}} in February 2011, introduced Debian GNU/kFreeBSD as a technology preview, featured a dependency-based boot system, and moved <b>problematic</b> firmware to the non-free area. Debian 7.0 (Wheezy) {{was released}} in May 2013, featuring multiarch support and Debian 8.0 (Jessie) {{was released in}} April 2015, using systemd as the new init system. Debian 9.0 (Stretch) was released in June 2017. , Debian is still in development and new packages are uploaded to unstable every day.|$|E
5|$|Dejection was a {{response}} to Wordsworth's Immortality Ode. It conveys feelings of dejection, expressed through an inability to write or appreciate nature. Wordsworth is introduced in the poem as a counterbalance to Coleridge; Wordsworth is able to turn his darkness to benefit and accept comfort. However, Coleridge cannot find any positive aspect to his despair, and is paralyzed by his emotions. The poem captures many of the feelings expressed in his earlier works, including his exploration of a <b>problematic</b> childhood and thoughts on his religious beliefs.|$|E
