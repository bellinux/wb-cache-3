50|$|Becker made a start {{toward the}} {{formalization}} of L. E. J. Brouwer's intuitionistic logic. He developed a semantics of intuitionistic logic based on Husserl's phenomenology, and this semantics {{was used by}} Arend Heyting in his own formalization. Becker struggled, somewhat unsuccessfully, with the formulation of the rejection of excluded middle appropriate for intuitionistic logic. Becker failed in the end to correctly distinguish classical and intuitionistic negation, but he made a start. In an appendix to his book on mathematical existence, Becker set the problem of finding a formal calculus for intuitionistic logic. In a series of works in the early 1950s he surveyed modal, intuitionistic, probabilistic, and other <b>philosophical</b> <b>logics.</b> He died, aged 75, in Bonn.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Philosophical</b> <b>logic</b> {{deals with}} formal {{descriptions}} of ordinary, non-specialist ("natural") language, that is strictly {{only about the}} arguments within philosophy's other branches. Most philosophers assume {{that the bulk of}} everyday reasoning can be captured in logic if a method or methods to translate ordinary language into that logic can be found. <b>Philosophical</b> <b>logic</b> is essentially a continuation of the traditional discipline called [...] "logic" [...] before the invention of mathematical logic. <b>Philosophical</b> <b>logic</b> has a much greater concern with the connection between natural language and logic. As a result, philosophical logicians have contributed a great deal to the development of non-standard logics (e.g. free logics, tense logics) as well as various extensions of classical logic (e.g. modal logics) and non-standard semantics for such logics (e.g. Kripke's supervaluationism in the semantics of logic).|$|E

Both frameworks are convinced as strong foundation {{of religious}} education development under rational-empirical principles of world society development. A lot of violence on the name of religion occur in the world and, to some extent, are found as religious education failure because of its exclusive learning model, which drive students far from their real multidimensional life problems. Responding to such situation religious education need to reform itself properly. In the context of Islamic education reform, {{we need to develop}} a kind of paradigmatically <b>philosophical</b> <b>logics</b> of Islamic education.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decades, logicians {{interested}} in rational agency and intelligent interaction studied major components of these phenomena, such as knowledge, belief, and preference. In recent years, standard ‘static’ logics describing information states of agents have been generalized to dynamic logics describing actions {{and events that}} produce information, revise beliefs, or change preferences, as explicit parts of the logical system. [22], [1], [12] are up-to-date accounts of this dynamic trend (the present paper follows Chapter 9 of the latter book). But in reality, concrete rational agency contains all these dynamic processes entangled. A concrete setting for this entanglement are games - and this paper is a survey of their interfaces with logic, both static and dynamic. Games are intriguing also since their analysis brings together two major streams, or tribal communities: ‘hard’ mathematical logics of computation, and ‘soft’ <b>philosophical</b> <b>logics</b> of propositional attitudes. Of course, this hard/soft distinction is spurious, {{and there is no}} natural border line between the two sources: it is their congenial mixture that makes current theories of agency so lively...|$|R

2500|$|Peirce {{regarded}} logic per se as {{a division}} of philosophy, as a normative science based on esthetics and ethics, as more basic than metaphysics, and as [...] "the art of devising methods of research".

Peirce called (with no sense of deprecation) [...] "mathematics of logic" [...] much of the kind of thing which, in current research and applications, is called simply [...] "logic". He was productive in both (<b>philosophical)</b> <b>logic</b> and logic's mathematics, which were connected deeply in his work and thought.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{alongside}} {{with the}} publication of pessimistic views on the possibility of developing satisfactory proof systems for modal logic, there has been an impressive burst of new ideas, methods, and results for the proof theory of modal and non-classical logics. All such endeavours converge to the creation of novel inferential methods that cover a wide variety of logics for which no analytic proof systems were previously known; they extend the methods of structural proof theory from pure <b>logic</b> to <b>philosophical</b> <b>logics</b> and axiomatic theories, and use a well developed semantic apparatus as a ground for the generation of proof systems. The purpose of this affiliated meeting is to bring together experts who are contributing to this growing field, to present their recent work and share ideas with a more generous time frame for talks and discussion and a specialized audience.
