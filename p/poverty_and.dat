Most of the Vietnamese poor live in densely populated river deltas and cities while remote upland areas {{have the highest}} <b>poverty</b> incidences, gaps, <b>and</b> severities. Forests of high local and global value are located in areas where relatively few poor people live, but where the incidence, gap, <b>and</b> severity of <b>poverty</b> are strongest, <b>and</b> where the livelihood strategies are based on agricultural and forest activities.

The results also show that lower inequality leads to lower <b>poverty</b> rate <b>and</b> <b>poverty</b> reduction could help to reduce inequality. Other determinants of inequality <b>and</b> <b>poverty</b> reduction include human capital, investment, GDP growth rate and trade openness. The main policy implication that emerges from this paper is that concentrating on poverty elimination will help us to build a more equitable society without sacrificing economic growth. ...|$|R

The results show a positive relation between crime <b>and</b> inequality <b>and</b> <b>poverty</b> in cross section regressions.
