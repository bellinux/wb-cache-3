40|$|AbstractA 33 Box–Behnken {{design and}} Response Surface Methodology were {{performed}} to evaluate the influence of extract feed rate, drying air inlet temperature and spray nozzle airflow rate on the process yield, stability parameters (moisture content and water activity) and on several physicomechanical properties of spray-dried rosemary extracts. Powder yield ranged from 17. 1 to 74. 96 %. The spray-dried rosemary extracts showed moisture content and water activity below 5 % and 0. 5 %, respectively, which indicate their chemical and microbiological stabilities. Even without using drying aids, some sets of experimental conditions rendered dried products with suitable flowability and compressibility characteristics for direct preparation of solid dosage forms. Analysis of variance and Response Surface Methodology proved that studied factors significantly affected most of the spray-dried rosemary extract quality indicators at different levels. The main processing parameter affecting the spray-dried rosemary extract characteristics was inlet temperature. The best combination of parameters used to obtain a reasonable yield of stable dry rosemary extracts with adequate technological properties for <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>purpose</b> involves an extract feed rate of 2 ml/min, 80 °C inlet temperature and 40 l/min SA.

40|$|Background and purpose: Pectin {{is widely}} used in food, {{cosmetic}} and drug industries. Because of high production and consumption of citrus fruits in Mazandaran, fruit peel is available in large quantities. The objective of the current investigation {{was to determine the}} amount of pectin, degree of estrification, a key factor in rheological properties of pectin, and galacturonic acid content as a criterion for pectin purity. Materials and Methods: Thirteen species of commonly used citrus fruits, orange cultivates (Citrus sinensis; Washington navel, Sanguinello, Valencia, Acidless, Moro, Shahsavari, Italian orange), Clementine, Unshiu, Grapefruit (C. paradisi), Bitter (sour) orange (C. aurantium), Lemon (C. limon) and Tangelo were collected at the ripening stage. All the trees were cultivated in the experimental fields, Fajr citrus experimental institute. Amount of pectin was determined by acidic extraction from dry albedos of fruits. Degree of estrification and galacturonic acid content were determined by USP standard titrimetric procedure. Results: The highest amount of pectin was found in Italian orange (27 %), Shahsavari orange (25 %) and Sanguinello (20 %) on the basis of dry weight. The highest degree of estrification (11. 5 %, 10. 9 % and 9. 6 %) was found in Lemon, Washington navel and Bitter (sour) orange respectively. The highest galacturonic acid contents were found in Washington navel, Lemon and Italian orange (89. 3, 85. 4 and 77. 7 respectively). Conclusion: Six fruits were suitable for utilization in drug industries including: Washington navel, Acidless, Shahsavari, Italian orange, Bitter (sour) orange (C. aurantium), Lemon (C. limon).

40|$|In this study, {{a simple}} and {{reliable}} HPLC method for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of cardiac glycosides in Digitalis lanata Ehrh. raw material was developed and applied to healthy and phytoplasma-infected plants. The target analytes cover {{a broad range of}} secondary metabolites, including primary, secondary and tertiary glycosides and the corresponding aglycones. The sample preparation was carried out by sonication of the plant material with 70 % (v/v) aqueous methanol at room temperature, followed by reversed-phase solid-phase extraction purification from interfering pigments. The HPLC analyses were performed on a Symmetry C(18) column (75 mm x 4. 6 mm I. D., 3. 5 microm), with a gradient elution composed of water and acetonitrile, at a flow rate of 1. 0 mL/min. The column temperature was set at 20 degrees C and the photodiode array detector monitored the eluent at 220 nm. The method was validated with respect to ICH guidelines and the validation parameters were found to be highly satisfactory. The application of the method to the analysis of D. lanata leaves indicated that air-drying was the optimum method for raw material processing when compared with freeze-drying. The analysis of healthy and phytoplasma-infected plants demonstrated that the secondary metabolite mainly affected by the pathogen presence was lanatoside C (153. 2 ug/ 100 mg versus 76. 1 ug/ 100 mg). Considering the importance of D. lanata plant material as source of cardiac glycosides, the developed method can be considered suitable for the phytochemical analysis and for the quality assurance of D. lanata used for <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>purpose...</b>|$|E
40|$|The snakehead murrel, Channa striata, or “Haruan” in Malaysia, is {{well known}} with its <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>purpose</b> and hence is {{extensively}} studied for its biochemical compound involved in medication while its knowledge on population structure is poorly inventoried. This {{study was conducted to}} characterize the naturally occurring populations of C. striata using both molecular and morphological approaches. These specimens were extensively caught from wide geographical range across Malaysia in the aim to propose spatial conservation assessment on this species as well as to investigate the possible hidden cryptic species of C. striata in Malaysia. Our data evidence the presence of variation in C. striata with the molecular divergence pattern is not congruent to the morphological divergence pattern. In this study, for example, population from Negeri Sembilan and Johor were genetically alike; however, these two populations together with population from Pulau Pinang were characterized by a unique head size in relation to others indicating that the physical habitat heterogeneity is probably the trait deformity agents. This suggests that environment conditions such as food source, changes in water temperature, contaminated organic compound and other possible environment factors will influence the development of fish trait which need not correlated with underlying genetic differences. Besides, our molecular data on DNA barcoding approach did not revealed possible cryptic species of C. striata among all studied sites in Malaysia although this species shows high population divergence in South-East Asia. This is supported by a monophyletic divergence pattern of C. striata reflected in the phylogenetic tree inferred using both NJ and Bayesian inference method with high statistical support.

The manifoM filtering device with suction flask and pump; the 600 l funnel is on the extreme l ft. 264 Note When many mounts have to be prepared the use of a manifold is practical and time saving. We have adapted the Sartorius ix-branch manifold and added a transition tube of stainless teel (right foreground of Fig. 1), threaded to fit the manifold outlet and tightened through a gasket. The funnel itself is mounted on the tube through a rubber stopper. Suction is by a small pump (25 l/min, 0. 15 kW). A suction flask is placed between the filter stand and the pump to collect he combined filtrates (Fig. 2).
