50|$|Pot-holders are {{a form of}} Personal Protective Equipment or PPE. They {{are used}} in kitchen {{settings}} to protect the kitchen staff from heat related injuries. However, one issue with having pot holders in commercial kitchens {{is that they are}} not sanitary. According to Food Service Technology 2.2, research has shown that Pot-holders are one of the sole culprits of cross contamination in the kitchen. This occurs when someone in the kitchen is working with raw food and then uses a Pot-holder without proper sanitation. When the next person uses the Pot-holder, they are subject to all the germs left behind previously. Another issue with Pot-holders is that the materials that they are made out of are often not water resistant, making them impossible to wash. This poses a problem because kitchens are full of accidental spills, and if a Pot-holder becomes soiled, there is no quick solution to cleaning it. If a <b>pot</b> <b>holder</b> becomes wet in any way, it becomes a steam burn risk. Because of these risks, Pot-holders have been banned from commercial kitchens in New Zealand, but {{there is no sign of}} them doing so in the United States anytime soon.|$|E

40|$|Figure 1 : Our {{system can}} capture and model {{deformation}} behavior of generic soft objects from kinematic data alone. We can then synthesize new motions that satisfy user-specified constraints {{and respond to}} dynamic perturbations. Top: left- a dinosaur walking; middle- a <b>pot</b> <b>holder</b> jumping; right- a coat hanger skipping. Bottom: lotus leaves moving in an artificial wind field. We present a data-driven method for deformation capture and mod-eling of general soft objects. We adopt an iterative framework that consists of one component for physics-based deformation tracking and another for spacetime optimization of deformation parameters. Low cost depth sensors are used for the deformation capture, {{and we do not}} require any force-displacement measurements, thus mak-ing the data capture a cheap and convenient process. We augment a state-of-the-art probabilistic tracking method to robustly handle noise, occlusions, fast movements and large deformations. The spacetime optimization aims to match the simulated trajectories with the tracked ones. The optimized deformation model is then used to boost the accuracy of the tracking results, which can in turn improve the deformation parameter estimation itself in later iter-ations. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the tracking and parameter optimization components complement each other nicely. Our spacetime optimization of the deformation model includes not only the material elasticity parameters and dynamic damping coef-ficients, but also the reference shape which can differ significantly from the static shape for soft objects. The resulting optimization problem is highly nonlinear in high dimensions, and challenging to solve with previous methods. We propose a novel splitting al-gorithm that alternates between reference shape optimization and deformation parameter estimation, and thus enables tailoring the optimization of each subproblem more efficiently and robustly...|$|E

40|$|The liquefiers {{have been}} moved to the new {{location}} of the Low-Tempera-ture Laboratory where an adequate surrounding area allows for much easier operation than did the cramped conditions which existed in the old labora-tory. The liquefiers and their compressors are on a concrete floor which eliminates much of the vibration experienced in the former location. There are now two independent liquefying setups. The plumbing is so arranged (as shown in Figure IV- 1) {{that any of the}} integral parts may be shifted from one setup to the other by means of the valving. If trouble should develop in a manifold, clean-up <b>pot,</b> gas <b>holder</b> or compressor during a run, the other manifold, clean-up <b>pot,</b> gas <b>holder</b> or compressor can be substituted within a few minutes so that the run may continue. Obviously, if both liquefiers were operating simultaneously, or if trouble should develop in a liquefier itself, such a substitution could not be accomplished. Moving the liquefiers on to a concrete floor presented the problem of placing tall dewars under the existing liquid draw-off tubes. In the former location a hole was cut in the wood floor and the dewars were lowered and raised through this hole. To avoid cutting a hole in the concrete floor, the end of the draw-off tube was raised. Now, at this raised height, {{it is much easier to}} hold the dewars into which the liquid helium is trans-ferred. The number two liquefier has continued to be adequate for supplying the demands for liquid helium during this transition period.

Patti purchased a weave machine to make <b>pot</b> <b>holders</b> and sold them around the neighborhood to earn money for her family. Patti would also host a summer school for the kids in her neighborhood and would receive gifts of cash for her efforts. When Patti was a teenager, she worked for the Mayor’s office creating a scrapbook. She eventually earned the Dorrance D. Roderick scholarship to attend Texas Western College. Patti married her husband and they moved to Germany for {{his work as a}} civil engineer in the United States Army. When they returned to the United States, Patti and her husband wanted to buy a home, but could not afford the types of homes they were finding, so they decided to build their home with their skills. Patti became the subcontractor and the general contractor. After their first home was completed, people purchasing homes in that area turned to Patti for assistance and that is how she got started in the developing business. She moved to Alaska with her family and after they returned, Patti and her husband decided to get back into development here in El Paso. Through different projects and situations, Patti learned how to maneuver residential development and concluded that she’d rather work in commercial design. Patti attended El Paso Community College and gained a formal education in commercial design. She worked in an internship with BPSI for almost three years and during her time there Patti learned a lot about the industry. Patti experienced gender discrimination, not earning {{the same amount of money}} for a project as a male counterpart would earn. Patti also experienced gender discrimination because she was a woman in a male dominated business in the 1970 ’s and 1980 ’s. She also faced challenges getting a line of credit to help expand her business, but Patti always worked through each obstacle, learning as much as she could, regardless of the outcome. Patti has done work for The University of Texas at El Paso, Southwestern Bell, as well as work in other cities in the U. S., maquiladoras in México, and corporations in Japan. Patti is 8 (a) certified Patti’s business is certified under the National Minority Supplier Development Council, she received assistance from the United States Small Business Administration, she has been Chairman of the Board of the Greater El Paso Chamber of Commerce, and is a part of the Armed Forces Committee, as well as the board of the Federal Reserve Bank, on the board for the El Paso Community College Design Department, she served on the and she is a part of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.

40|$|Savannah River Remediation (SRR) is {{planning}} to remove a buildup of sodium aluminosilicate scale from the 2 H-evaporator pot by loading and soaking the pot with heated 1. 5 M nitric acid solution. Sampling {{and analysis of the}} scale material from the 2 H evaporator has been performed so that the evaporator can be chemically cleaned beginning July of 2013. Historically, since the operation of the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF), silicon in the DWPF recycle stream combines with aluminum in the typical tank farm supernate to form sodium aluminosilicate scale mineral deposits in the 2 H-evaporator pot and gravity drain line. The 2 H-evaporator scale samples analyzed by Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) came from the bottom cone sections of the 2 H-evaporator <b>pot.</b> The sample <b>holder</b> from the 2 H-evaporator wall was virtually empty and {{was not included in the}} analysis. It is worth noting that after the delivery of these 2 H-evaporator scale samples to SRNL for the analyses, the plant customer determined that the 2 H evaporator could be operated for additional period prior to requiring cleaning. Therefore, there was no need for expedited sample analysis as was presented in the Technical Task Request. However, a second set of 2 H evaporator scale samples were expected in May of 2013, which would need expedited sample analysis. X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) confirmed the bottom cone section sample from the 2 H-evaporator pot consisted of nitrated cancrinite, (a crystalline sodium aluminosilicate solid), clarkeite and uranium oxide. There were also mercury compound XRD peaks which could not be matched and further X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis of the sample confirmed the existence of elemental mercury or mercuric oxide. On ''as received'' basis, the scale contained an average of 7. 09 E+ 00 wt % total uranium (n = 3; st. dev. = 8. 31 E- 01 wt %) with a U- 235 enrichment of 5. 80 E- 01 % (n = 3; st. dev. = 3. 96 E- 02 %). The measured U- 238 concentration was 7. 05 E+ 00 wt % (n= 3, st. dev. = 8. 25 E- 01 wt %). Analyses results for Pu- 238 and Pu- 239, and Pu- 241 are 7. 06 E- 05 {+-} 7. 63 E- 06 wt %, 9. 45 E- 04 {+-} 3. 52 E- 05 wt %, and < 2. 24 E- 06 wt %, respectively. These results are provided so that SRR can calculate the equivalent uranium- 235 concentrations for the NCSA. Because this 2 H evaporator pot bottom scale sample contained a significant amount of elemental mercury (11. 7 wt % average), it is recommended that analysis for mercury be included in future Technical Task Requests on 2 H evaporator sample analysis at SRNL. Results confirm that the uranium contained in the scale remains depleted with respect to natural uranium. SRNL did not calculate an equivalent U- 235 enrichment, which takes into account other fissionable isotopes U- 233, Pu- 239 and Pu- 241...|$|R
