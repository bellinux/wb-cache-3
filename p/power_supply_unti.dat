In this paper, the design and simulation of a separate excited pulse <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> are proposed. The <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> can produce high-voltage small-current pulses adaptive to different loads. The working principle of the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> is analyzed.

The circuit implementation of <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> is proposed. The key component for the <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> pulse transformer, {{as well as other}} components is studied in detail. Based on the analysis, an optimized design of the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> is proposed. Computer simulation is used to verify the performance of the designed <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> such as the output characteristics under different load resistances, the pulse frequency and the duty ratio.

50|$|A {{switched-mode}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> (switching-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> switch-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> switched <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> SMPS, or switcher) is {{an electronic}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> that incorporates a switching regulator to convert electrical power efficiently. Like other <b>power</b> <b>supplies,</b> an SMPS transfers power from a DC or AC source (often mains power) to DC loads, {{such as a}} personal computer, while converting voltage and current characteristics. Unlike a linear <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> the pass transistor of a switching-mode supply continually switches between low-dissipation, full-on and full-off states, and spends very little time in the high dissipation transitions, which minimizes wasted energy. Ideally, a switched-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> dissipates no <b>power.</b> Voltage regulation is achieved by varying the ratio of on-to-off time. In contrast, a linear <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> regulates the output voltage by continually dissipating power in the pass transistor. This higher power conversion efficiency is an important advantage of a switched-mode <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> Switched-mode <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> may also be substantially smaller and lighter than a linear supply due to the smaller transformer size and weight.|$|R

50|$|<b>Power</b> <b>supplies</b> are {{categorized}} {{in various}} ways, including by functional features. For example, a regulated <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> {{is one that}} maintains constant output voltage or current despite variations in load current or input voltage. Conversely, the output of an unregulated <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> can change significantly when its input voltage or load current changes. Adjustable <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> allow the output voltage or current to be programmed by mechanical controls (e.g., knobs on the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> front panel), or {{by means of a}} control input, or both. An adjustable regulated <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> is one that is both adjustable and regulated. An isolated <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> has a <b>power</b> output that is electrically independent of its power input; this is in contrast to other <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> that share a common connection between power input and output.|$|R

For example, operational amplifiers have a specified <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> rejection ratio that indicates how well the output can reject signals that appear on the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> inputs. <b>Power</b> <b>supply</b> inputs are often noisy in large designs because the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> is used by nearly every component in the design, and inductance effects prevent current from being instantaneously delivered to every component at once.
