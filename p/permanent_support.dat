500|$|Bonds met Susann ("Sun") Margreth Branco, {{the mother}} of his first two {{children}} (Nikolai and Shikari), in Montreal, Quebec in August 1987. They eloped to Las Vegas February 5, 1988. The couple separated in June 1994, divorced in December 1994, and had their marriage annulled in 1997 by the Catholic Church. The divorce was a media affair because Bonds had his Swedish spouse sign a prenuptial agreement in which she [...] "waived her right to a share of his present and future earnings" [...] and which was upheld. Bonds had been providing his wife $20,000/month in child support and $10,000 in spousal support {{at the time of the}} ruling. During the hearings to set <b>permanent</b> <b>support</b> levels, allegations of abuse came from both parties. The trial dragged on for months, but Bonds was awarded both houses and reduced support. On August 21, 2000, the Supreme Court of California, in an opinion signed by Chief Justice Ronald M. George, unanimously held that [...] "substantial evidence supports the determination of the trial court that the [...] agreement in the present case was entered into voluntarily." [...] In reaction to the decision, significant changes in California law relating to the validity and enforceability of premarital agreements soon followed.|$|E
500|$|Throughout 2012 La Dispute went on {{a series}} of {{headline}} tours that acted as promotion for Wildlife, with tour legs in Europe, Australia and North America. La Dispute's European tour took place over January and early February with support from Former Thieves. Their Australian tour started four days after their European tour, and instead of having a <b>permanent</b> <b>support</b> band, they had a different lineup every night, composed of local bands. The North American leg of the tour started in late March, lasting into June and had support from Balance and Composure, Sainthood Reps, and All Get Out. At their shows in the United States in April, the band collaborated with 826michigan once again to release 150 limited-edition packets at their shows. These packets included their CD [...] "Conversations", which annotates the lyrical themes in Wildlife in depth, along with rare photos, a poster, postcards and other items. In June 2012, the band made several festival appearances in Europe including Download Festival, Greenfield Festival, Hurricane Festival and Southside Festival, during a short European tour with Hot Water Music. La Dispute planned to do a third European tour with Title Fight and Make Do and Mend in September and October 2012.|$|E

2500|$|Although he {{assigned}} an unimportant role to King Michael, Antonescu {{took steps}} to increase the monarchy's prestige, personally inviting Carol's estranged wife, Queen Mother Helen, to return home. However, his preferred military structures functioned in cooperation with a bureaucracy inherited from the National Renaissance Front. According to historian of fascism Philip Morgan: [...] "Antonescu probably wanted to create, or perpetuate, something like Carol's front organization." [...] Much of his <b>permanent</b> <b>support</b> base comprised former National Christian Party members, {{to the point where}} he was seen as successor to Octavian Goga. While maintaining a decorative replacement for Parliament—known as Adunarea Obștească Plebiscitară a Națiunii Române ("The General Plebiscitary Assembly of the Romanian Nation") and convoked only twice— he took charge of hierarchical appointments, and personally drafted new administrative projects. In 1941, he disestablished participative government in localities and counties, replacing it with a corporatist structure appointed by prefects whom he named. In stages between August and October 1941, he instituted civilian administration of Transnistria under Governor Gheorghe Alexianu, whose status he made equivalent to that of a cabinet minister. Similar measures were taken in Bukovina and Bessarabia (under Governors Corneliu Calotescu and Gheorghe Voiculescu, respectively). Antonescu strictly relied on the chain of command, and his direct orders to the Army overrode civilian hierarchies. This system allowed room for endemic political corruption and administrative confusion. The Romanian leader also tolerated a gradual loss of authority over the German communities in Romania, in particular the Transylvanian Saxon and Banat Swabian groups, in agreement with Hitler's views on the Volksdeutsche. This trend was initiated by Saxon Nazi activist Andreas Schmidt in cooperation with the Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle, resulting in de facto self-governance under a Nazi system which was also replicated among the 130,000 Black Sea Germans of Transnistria. Many young German Romanian men opted to join the Schutzstaffel as early as 1940 and, in 1943, an accord between Antonescu and Hitler automatically sent ethnic Germans of recruitable age into the Wehrmacht.|$|E
60|$|Relatively to {{the other}} works of Dickens Oliver Twist is not of great value, but it is of great importance. Some parts of it are so crude and of so clumsy a melodrama, that one is almost tempted to say that Dickens would have been greater without it. But {{even if he had}} been greater without it he would still have been {{incomplete}} without it. With the exception of some gorgeous passages, both of humour and horror, the interest of the book lies not so much in its revelation of Dickens's literary genius as in its revelation of those moral, personal, and political instincts which were the make-up of his character and the <b>permanent</b> <b>support</b> of that literary genius. It {{is by far the most}} depressing of all his books; it is in some ways the most irritating; yet its ugliness gives the last touch of honesty to all that spontaneous and splendid output. Without this one discordant note all his merriment might have seemed like levity.|$|E
