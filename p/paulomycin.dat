40|$|The paulomycins are a {{group of}} glycosylated {{compounds}} featuring a unique paulic acid moiety. To locate their biosynthetic gene clusters, the genomes of two <b>paulomycin</b> producers, Streptomyces paulus NRRL 8115 and Streptomyces sp. YN 86, were sequenced. The <b>paulomycin</b> biosynthetic gene clusters were defined by comparative analyses of the two genomes together with the genome of the third <b>paulomycin</b> producer Streptomyces albus J 1074. Subsequently, {{the identity of the}} <b>paulomycin</b> biosynthetic gene cluster was confirmed by inactivation of two genes involved in biosynthesis of the paulomycose branched chain (pau 11) and the ring A moiety (pau 18) in Streptomyces paulus NRRL 8115. After determining the gene cluster boundaries, a convergent biosynthetic model was proposed for <b>paulomycin</b> based on the deduced functions of the pau genes. Finally, a <b>paulomycin</b> high-producing strain was constructed by expressing an activator-encoding gene (pau 13) in S. paulus, setting the stage for future investigations...|$|E
40|$|Four novel <b>paulomycin</b> {{derivatives}} {{have been}} isolated from S. albus J 1074 grown in MFE culture medium. These compounds are structural analogs of antibiotics 273 a 2 α and 273 a 2 β containing a thiazole moiety, probably originated through an intramolecular Michael addition. The novel, thiazole, moiety-containing paulomycins show a lower antibiotic activity than paulomycins A and B against Gram-positive bacteria. However, {{two of them}} show an improved activity against Gram-negative bacteria. In addition, the four novel compounds are more stable in culture than paulomycins A and B. Thus, {{the presence of an}} N-acetyl-l-cysteine moiety linked to the carbon atom of the paulic acid isothiocyanate moiety, via a thioester bond, and the subsequent intramolecular cyclization of the paulic acid to generate a thiazole heterocycle confer to paulomycins a higher structural stability that otherwise will conduce to <b>paulomycin</b> degradation and into inactive paulomenols...|$|E
40|$|A bovine {{polymorphonuclear}} leukocyte (PMN) monolayer {{system was}} used to determine the ability of different antibiotics to kill surviving intracellular Staphylococcus aureus. The following classes of antimicrobial agents were tested in this high-volume assay procedure: aminocyclitol, beta-lactam, coumarin, lincosaminide, macrolide, naphthalenic ansamycin, <b>paulomycin,</b> peptide, quinolone, and tetracycline. The activities of these compounds were compared with those of positive (rifampin), negative (cloxacillin), and non-antibiotic-treated controls. Only oxytetracycline, the ansamycins (rifampin, rifamycin SV, streptovaricin A, C, and D), <b>paulomycin,</b> and paldimycin caused a significant reduction in the viable count of intracellular S. aureus. Of these, however, the intracellular killing by the streptovaricins was directly related to the cytotoxicity (as determined by trypan blue exclusion) of these compounds for the PMNs. Although the paulomycins were cytotoxic for the PMNs, the cytotoxic and the intracellular killing activity of these new compounds could be distinguished. The relevance of these results to the therapeutic effectiveness of these antibiotics in the treatment of bovine staphylococcal mastitis is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Streptomyces albus J 1074 is a streptomycete strain {{widely used}} as a host for {{expression}} of secondary metabolite gene clusters. Bioinformatic analysis of the genome of this organism predicts the presence of 27 gene clusters for secondary metabolites. We have used three different strategies for the activation {{of some of these}} silent/cryptic gene clusters in S. albus J 1074 : two hybrid polyketide-non-ribosomal peptides (PK-NRP) (antimycin and 6 -epi-alteramides), a type I PK (candicidin), a non-ribosomal peptides (NRP) (indigoidine) and glycosylated compounds (paulomy-cins). By insertion of a strong and constitutive pro-moter in front of selected genes of two clusters, production of the blue pigment indigoidine and of two novel members of the polycyclic tetramate macrolactam family (6 -epi-alteramides A and B) was activated. Overexpression of positive regulatory genes from the same organism also activated the biosynthesis of 6 -epi-alteramides and heterologous expression of the regulatory gene pimM of the pimaricin cluster activated the simultaneous produc-tion of candicidins and antimycins, suggesting some kind of cross-regulation between both clusters. A cluster for glycosylated compounds (<b>paulomycins)</b> was also identified by comparison of the high-performance liquid chromatography profiles of the wild-type strain with that of a mutant in which two key enzymes of the cluster were simultaneously deleted...|$|R
