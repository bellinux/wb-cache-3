25|$|She {{referred}} to her early girlhood as the most eventful <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>life.</b> There was the long journey to Vermont the summer she was 18 months old, and her young mother’s death only four days after reaching the state which it had been hoped would give her health. There was the sojourn in New York, where William had established himself in business, and where he wanted his little daughter’s company.

Dorr grew to womanhood in a home of culture and refinement, and it is here where she began writing as a little child.
