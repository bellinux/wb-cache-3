40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{strategy}} for administering a survey that is mindful of sensitive data and individual privacy. The survey in question seeks to estimate the population proportions of a sensitive, <b>polychotomous</b> <b>variable</b> and does not depend on anonymity, cryptography, or in legal guarantees for its privacy preserving properties. Our technique, called Negative Surveys, presents interviewees with a question and t possible answers, and asks participants to eliminate one of t − 1 alternatives at random. The method is closely related to randomized response techniques (RRTs) in that both rely on a random component to preserve privacy; however, while RRTs require respondents to choose among questions and give an answer, negative surveys ask them to choose between possible answers to a single question. This distinction has important consequences for the privacy, methodology, and reliability of our scheme. In the course of the paper we quantify the amount of information surrendered by an interviewee, elaborate on how to estimate the desired population proportions, and discuss the properties of our method at length. We also introduce a specific setup that requires a single coin as a randomizing device, and that limits the amount of information each respondent is exposed to by presenting to them only a subset of the question’s alternatives...|$|E

40|$|An {{automatic}} precedure {{that uses}} linear splines and their tensor products is proposed for fitting a regression model to data involving a <b>polychotomous</b> repsonse <b>variable</b> {{and one or}} more predictors. The fitted model {{can be used for}} multiple classification. The automatic fitting procedure involves maximum likelihood estimation, stepwise addition, stepwise deletion, and model selection by AIC, cross-validation or an independent test set. A modified version of the algorithm has been constructed that is applicable to large data sets, and it is illustrated using a phoneme recognition data set with 250, 000 cases, 45 classes and 63 predictors...|$|R
40|$|Modeling {{customer}} purchase {{behavior is}} an important task for marketing scientists. Unlike market response models, {{which tend to be}} amenable to estimation by traditional regression analysis, customer behavior models tend to have structures that require specialized econometric techniques. In particular, they may require nonlinear regression models in which the response outcomes are discrete and the error terms are not normally distributed. For example, modeling whether a household will buy or not buy a product involves a qualitative dependent variable: a dummy variable that might equal 1 for purchase and 0 for no purchase. Such models, as is well known, require techniques such as logit and probit. The dependent variable need not be binary but could be <b>polychotomous.</b> Categorical <b>variables</b> with many choice categories require the use of multinomial logit (if th...|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} the {{logistic}} function since its introduction in 1838 is reviewed, and the logistic model for a <b>polychotomous</b> response <b>variable</b> is presented {{with a discussion of}} the assumptions involved in its derivation and use. Following this, the maximum likelihood estimators for the model parameters are derived along with a Newton-Raphson iterative procedure for evaluation. A rigorous mathematical derivation of the limiting distribution of the maximum likelihood estimators is then presented using a characteristic function approach. An appendix with theorems on the asymptotic normality of sample sums when the observations are not identically distributed, with proofs, supports the presentation on asymptotic properties of the maximum likelihood estimators. Finally, two applications of the model are presented using data from the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program, a prospective, population-based, randomized trial of treatment for hypertension. The first application compares the risk of five-year mortality from cardiovascular causes with that from noncardiovascular causes; the second application compares risk factors for fatal or nonfatal coronary heart disease with those for fatal or nonfatal stroke. ...|$|R

Multinomial logistic regression parameter estimation usually use classical method that is based only on current information obtained from the sample without taking into account the initial information of logistic regression parameters. If have early information about parameter is prior distribution, the parameter estimation can use Bayes method. Bayesian methods combine information on the sample with prior distribution of information, and the results are expressed in the posterior distribution. If posterior distribution can not be derived analytically so approximated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm especially Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. This algorithm uses acceptance and rejection mechanism to generate a sequence of random samples...|$|R
40|$|Wacholder, and J. H. Lubin. Does nondifferential {{misclassification}} {{of exposure}} always bias a true effect toward the null value? Am J Epidemiol 1990; 132 : 746 - 8. The authors present some examples {{to demonstrate that}} in certain nondiffer-ential misclassification conditions with <b>polychotomous</b> exposure <b>variables,</b> esti-mates of odds ratios for categories at intermediate level of risk can be biased away from the null or can change direction. In addition, the authors present two examples {{to demonstrate that the}} slope of the dose-response trend for the true distributions can change direction, creating a false inverse trend, even if the misclassification is nondifferential. bias; case-control studies; dose-response trend; epidemiologic methods; mis-classification, nondifferential It is often stated that nondifferential misclassification of exposure, which is in-dependent of disease status, can only bias an estimate of a true positive odds ratio downward and not away from or beyond the null value (1 - 6). Although this is true for dichotomous exposures, we present two examples to demonstrate that the bias is not necessarily downward when a polycho-tomous exposure measure is used. We fur-ther show that an estimate of trend in an ordered polychotomous exposure can change direction in the presence of nondif-ferential misclassification. Consider the correctly classified data from a hypothetical case-control study shown in "a " in table 1. Assume that for both cases and controls, 40 percent of sub-jects truly in the high exposure group are Received for publication February 14, 1990, and in final form April 30, 1990.
