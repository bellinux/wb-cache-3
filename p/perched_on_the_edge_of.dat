5|$|The oldest volcano in the chain, Meiji Seamount, <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the Aleutian Trench, formed 85 {{million years}} ago. At its current velocity, the {{seamount}} {{will be destroyed}} within a few million years, as the Pacific Plate slides under the Eurasian Plate. It is unknown whether the seamount chain has been subducting under the Eurasian Plate, and whether the hotspot is older than Meiji Seamount, as any older seamounts have since been destroyed by the plate margin. It {{is also possible that}} a collision near the Aleutian Trench had changed the velocity of the Pacific Plate, explaining the hotspot chain's bend; the relationship between these features is still being investigated.|$|E

5000|$|From the prewar 1940 (Showa 15) {{until the}} postwar 1949 (Showa 24), {{the name of}} Golden Bat was {{considered}} as a hostile word and changed into [...] "Kinshi" [...] meaning a golden kite. That was based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mythology of Emperor Jimmu, {{who was the first}} emperor of Japan. The design was also changed along with it. At first a golden kite <b>perching</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of a bow was designed, however, it was changed to without a bow due to indication that it can be irreverent if the package drawn a golden kite <b>perching</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of a bow was thrown away and stepped <b>on.</b> In <b>the</b> mythology of Emperor Jimmu, a golden kite <b>perching</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of a bow led to a victory.|$|R

25|$|The video {{opens with}} a shot of running water. Rihanna is then {{presented}} undressing and climbing into a bathtub. Throughout {{the rest of the}} video, the singer is presented nude in the tub full of cloudy green water; subtle camera angles protect her modesty. Rihanna is shown wearing little make-up and with long hair tangled and wet over one side of her face. The singer seems morose and sad as she occasionally flickers her eyes to the ceiling and puts her head in her hands, showing off long manicured nails and a diamond stud earring. The low-key video also features Mikky Ekko, who performs his parts of the song separately including scenes of him <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a different bathtub, gazing into a mirror, in front of an unlit fireplace, and sitting on a grand chair. The video switches between the pair throughout the course of the video until it concludes with a single tear falling from Rihanna's eye as she sinks lower into the bathtub.|$|E
500|$|David Fricke, in {{his review}} for the {{magazine}} Rolling Stone, considers Imaginos [...] "the best black-plastic blitz to bear the Cult's trademark cross and claw since 1974's Secret Treaties", but remarks that the [...] "lengthy gestation" [...] of the album and the many musicians involved makes it [...] "a bit of a cheat for Cult Purists", and that is [...] "only an illusionary re-creation of the way BÖC used to be". William Ruhlmann of AllMusic wrote that Imaginos is [...] "the album that comes closest to defining Blue Öyster Cult" [...] and their [...] "creative swan song", and [...] "perhaps BÖC's most consistent album, certainly its most uncompromising (...) and also {{the closest thing to}} a real heavy-metal statement from a band that never quite fit that description". For Don Kaye of Kerrang!, the album is [...] "the best BÖC slab since (...) Cultösaurus Erectus and harks back in style and attitude towards the brilliance of masterpieces like Secret Treaties and Spectres". A contrary evaluation comes from Blue Öyster Cult biographer Martin Popoff, who has [...] "come to dismiss it as somewhat of a sell-out". Despite it being [...] "the band's heaviest, fulfilling many a fan’s wish for sustained metal", Popoff finds [...] "the whole thing <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> parody, too dressy and fantastical lyrically in a painfully self-conscious way, (...) a laborious exercise in expected weird", ultimately [...] "a baffling yet anticlimactic punctuation to the band’s perplexed career". A reviewer from the Italian music criticism site Storia della Musica points out that the album is now a 'cult' item for its rarity, its content and the scarce love shown by the band for this work. He writes that [...] "it could have been the Tommy or The Dark Side of the Moon of BÖC" [...] but, [...] "despite the profound influences it evokes", its [...] "mutilated and sabotaged form" [...] and the disinterest of the musicians involved makes Imaginos only a wasted opportunity.|$|E

2500|$|Sagan {{was married}} three times. [...] In 1957, he married {{biologist}} Lynn Margulis. The couple had two children, Jeremy and Dorion Sagan. After Carl Sagan and Margulis divorced, he married artist Linda Salzman in 1968 {{and they also}} had a child together, Nick Sagan. During these marriages, Carl Sagan focused heavily on his career, a factor which {{may have contributed to}} Sagan's first divorce. In 1981, Sagan married author Ann Druyan and they later had two children, Alexandra and Samuel Sagan. Carl Sagan and Druyan remained married until his death in 1996. He lived in an Egyptian revival house in Ithaca <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a cliff that had formerly been the headquarters of a Cornell secret society.|$|E
2500|$|Ardencaple Castle, {{also known}} as Ardincaple Castle, and {{sometimes}} referred to as Ardencaple Castle Light, is a listed building, situated about [...] from Helensburgh, Argyll and Bute, Scotland. Today, all that remains of the castle is a tower, <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a plateau, looking down on a flat tract of land between it and the shore of the Firth of Clyde. The original castle was thought to have been built sometime in the 12th century, and part of the remains of the original castle were said to have existed in the 19th century. Today, that sole remaining tower is used as a navigational aid for shipping on the Firth of Clyde. Because of its use as a lighthouse the tower has been called Ardencaple Castle Light.|$|E

5000|$|The {{programme}} {{received the}} Guild of Television Producers and Directors (now BAFTA) {{award for best}} factual programme in 1957 and 1958. The style was informal with no attempt to hide studio equipment. Michelmore gave a very relaxed performance, sometimes <b>perching</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of his desk, seemingly unfazed by the ringing of his desk telephone letting him know about technical problems. There were regular appearances by Rory McEwen, Cy Grant, singing a [...] "topical calypso", and folk singers Robin Hall and Jimmie MacGregor. Michelmore became known for his catchphrase when closing the show, [...] "That's all for tonight, the next 'Tonight' will be tomorrow night. Until then, good night!" ...|$|R

It was shot by photographer Joe Lyons at his first photo studio in north London, and he described how he had set up the shot: [...] "I'd just shot some furniture for a furniture designer, and got paid with the furniture.

George, his red hair all rumpled up, and his long limbs thrust out towards the fire, spoke scarcely at all, but glued his little bloodshot eyes alternately on the faces of his companions, and only contributed an occasional chuckle. But the soul of this witches' gathering was evidently Lady Bellamy. She was standing up, and energetically detailing some scheme, the great pupils of her eyes expanding and contracting as the unholy flame within them rose and fell.|$|E

They held the shale-sprinkled grass for an hour, swept round the shoulder of an immortal cliff, and climbed into a new country entirely blocked off from all sight of Chini valley. A huge pasture-ground ran up fan-shaped to the living snow. At its base was perhaps half an acre of flat land, on which stood a few soil and timber huts. Behind them--for, hill-fashion, they were <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> all things--the ground fell sheer two thousand feet to Shamlegh-midden, where never yet man has set foot.|$|E
