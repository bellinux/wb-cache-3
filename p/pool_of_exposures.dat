40|$|Whether it {{concerns}} a private individual, a corporate, {{a financial institution}} or even a government, we all obey the rule that he who lends money to a counterparty is exposed {{to the risk of}} financial loss, in case the borrower fails to honor the terms and conditions specified in the credit agreement. One speaks of default by the obligor and, broadly, refers to the associated risk as credit risk. As in the traditional life and non-life insurance industry,bilateral contracts are developed, by financial institutions, that allow for a risk-transfer between the lender (the protection buyer) and a third party (the protection seller). The protection seller agrees to cover(part of) the loss suffered by the lender in the (uncertain) event of adefault by the borrower (the reference entity). In return for this assurance, the protection buyer pays a periodic premium to the protection seller. Like insurance products, the value of these so-called credit derivatives depends entirely on the underlying (credit) risk. Moreover, thesecontracts can generally be entered into cost-free. No initial payment is required by either of the parties in order to close the deal. Such instruments are called unfunded. However, unlike traditional insurance contracts, credit derivatives can be traded. The corresponding market has seen an exponential growth over the last fifteenyears. From almost nothing in 1995, the total market notional now exceeds 30 trillion (1012) U. S. dollar, according to recent estimates (mid 2009). Moreover, by now this market is well-established, strictly-regulated and (highly) liquid. No doubt, the major catalyst for this immense succes is that, by mitigating risk exposures, credit derivatives can be used to offset and reduce the regulatory capital requirements imposed by the Basel II Capital Accord (2004). The latter agreement provides a unified framework for minimal capital requirements, supervisory review and market discipline, but fails to adopt a standardized approach with regard to assessing credit risk. On the contrary, under the internal ratings-based approach institutions are encouraged to usetheir own internal measures for the key drivers of credit risk, powering the demand for models to price credit derivatives. As key drivers, Basel II identifies the reference entity's default probability and the loss-given-default, i. e. the percentage of the exposure-at-default that willnot be recovered following default. However, with regard to funded credit derivatives and securitization in general, a third driver comes to play, namely the prepayment risk, i. e. the potential loss due to the full or partial early redemption of the outstandingdebt by borrowers. In case of funded derivatives, protection is bought by a so-called special purpose vehicle and payments under the credit derivative are funded using securitization techniques. Securitization is a transaction where the cash flows from an underlying <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures</b> (e. g. loans) are used to service at least two different series (tranches) of bonds (called securities). These tranches reflect different degrees of credit risk. This allows investors to select those securities that match their personal risk appetite. In this dissertation, building on the extensive literature on structural models for credit risk, we develop an integrated mathematical framework for default risk, loss-given-default and prepayment risk; with a focus towards securitization and a clear preference for Lévy processes as the stochastic mechanism to describe the underlying price dynamics. In the last decade, research departments of major banks started to accept jump processes as avaluable tool in modeling day-to-day market fluctuations. This increasing interest in Lévy models in finance {{can be attributed to the}} flexibility of the underlying probability distributions and to the presence of jumps in the sample paths. The distributions allow for skewness and excesskurtosis, granting a sufficiently high probability to the risk of extreme price movements over short time intervals. Moreover, the sample pathscan adequately represent the sudden jumps in the observed prices. It isof key importance to deal with these shocks if the market risk is to bemeasured and managed correctly. The text is structured as follows. Chapter 1 is intended as an accessible introduction to credit risk and securitization. We introduce the former concept based on several real-life examples. Next, we elaborate on credit derivatives. We explain the notion of a derivative instrument, look at the development of the market, discuss the different counterparties involved in the contract and overview the most important products. Subsequently, we clarify the idea of securitization. We show how this originally as a financing transaction intended technique can also be used to mitigate credit risk. We end the chapter with a preamble on credit risk modeling. Chapter 2 provides the necessary mathematical background. We introduce the basics of probability theory from a measure-theoretic point of view. Subsequently, we define the important concepts of a probability space, a random variable and a stochastic process. A second part is devoted to mathematical finance in continuous time. We discuss filtrations and clarify the important no-arbitrage theory and the relatedrisk-neutral valuation principle. The chapter ends with a remark about homogeneous portfolios. Chapter 3 is dedicatedto Lévy processes. In this dissertation, the latter are the elected tool to describe the price mechanism of the reference asset and the corresponding derivative instrument. We formally define a Lévy process and debate its structure and properties. Next, we discuss a technique that allows to generate sample paths of almost any Lévy process. Then, we provide several examples of Lévy processes that will be used in the subsequent chapters. Thereafter, we introduce the so-called Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes. We grant special attention to the particular case of the Gamma-OU process, that will appear later on. A justification as to why use Lévy processes in finance concludes the chapter. Chapter 4 deals with modeling the risks of default and prepayment within a securitization framework. We review the two most popular approachesto assess credit risk, i. e. the firm-value and the reduced-form approach. With regard to the probability of default, we discuss several well-acknowledged, several recently developed and some new (Lévy-based) models under both approaches. We examine how these can be adjusted and tailoredto fit within the securitization frame. All models are either based on the Normal distribution or on the Gamma distribution. Next, we focus on describing the risk of prepayment. Thereby, we enlist on the default risk models and extend the latter to be able to cope with prepayment. A major challenge, in this respect, is taking the correlation between these two risks into account. At the end of the chapter we discuss a case studywhere the developed models are used in an algorithm to determine the rating of two tranches of loan-backed securities. In Chapter 5 we discuss a generic framework to obtain stochastic loss-given-default in an arbitrary firm-value model for credit risk. We implement the technique into the Normal one-factor and the Gamma one-factor models. Next, we examine how stochastic loss-given-default influences thecapital charges under the Basel II Accord (2004). We also compare our approach to two models recently developed in the banking industry. Finally, we look at the impact of stochastic loss-given-default on the rating of the securities in the case study of the previous chapter. Chapter 6 is a stand-alone chapter. Here, we investigate the practical implementation of a particular member of a new ten-parameter family of Lévy processes, referred to as the Beta-family, introduced by Kuznetsov (2009). The process that we concentrate on is parameterizedin order to resemble the popular Variance-Gamma process due to Carr, Chang and Madan (1998). We therefore have baptized the new model as the Beta-Variance Gamma model. We discuss and examine its applications in pricing equity derivatives and credit derivatives. A summary of the main results and an outlook to future research conclude the study. nrpages: 260 status: publishe...|$|E

We model the heteroskedasticity of secondary market spreads of European CDO, MBS and Pfandbrief transactions in a multi-factor GARCH process for valuation and forecasting purposes. We find that expected spread changes tend to be level stationary with model estimates indicating asymmetric mean reversion with a positive trend depending on the direction of past innovations and spread changes. Also, conditional spread volatility follows an asymmetric stochastic process biased towards negative past residuals associated with spread declines, which inflate time-varying heteroskedasticity. These spread dynamics of ABS imply that negative investor sentiment during persistent spread increases causes spreads to escape stationary approximation in the long run, especially for unexpected downward price corrections...|$|R

Although passive aerial dispersal of freshwater invertebrates is generally accepted, the frequency and relative importance of wind as a vector is still subject of considerable debate. We assessed the importance of wind dispersal in an invertebrate metacommunity in a cluster of 36 temporary rock pools on an isolated mountaintop in South Africa. Wind dispersal was quantified every four days using nine windsocks (about 1. 5 m above rock base), placed in the field during one month. Distance to the nearest pool varied from 2 up to 16 m.

40|$|The {{earliest}} report linking environmental (occupational) {{exposure to}} adverse human male reproductive effects {{dates back to}} 1775 when an English physician, Percival Pott, reported {{a high incidence of}} scrotal cancer in chimney sweeps.

The fact that male-mediated reproductive harm in humans may be a result <b>of</b> toxicant <b>exposures</b> did not become firmly established until relatively recently, when Lancranjan studied lead-exposed workers in Romania in 1975, and later in 1977, when Whorton examined the effects of dibromochloropropane (DBCP) on male workers in California.

BackgroundEpidemiologic studies have associated exposure to ambient PM 10 with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We have previously shown that PM 10 exposure induces a systemic inflammatory response that includes marrow stimulation, and we hypothesized that this response accelerates atherosclerosis. MethodsWatanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits were exposed to PM 10 (n = 10) or vehicle (n = 6) for four weeks, and bone marrow stimulation was measured. Quantitative histologic methods were used to determine the morphologic features of the atherosclerotic lesions. ResultsExposure to PM 10 caused an increase in circulating polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) band cell counts (day 15 : 24. 6 ± 3. 0 vs. 11. 5 ± 2. 7 × 107 /l [PM 10 vs. vehicle], p < 0. 01) and an increase {{in the size of the}} bone marrow mitotic <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> PMNs. <b>Exposure</b> to PM 10 also caused progression of atherosclerotic lesions toward a more advanced phenotype. The volume fraction (vol/vol) of the coronary atherosclerotic lesions was increased by PM 10 exposure (33. 3 ± 4. 6 % vs. 19. 5 ± 3. 1 % [PM 10 vs. vehicle], p < 0. 05). The vol/vol of atherosclerotic lesions correlated with the number of alveolar macrophages that phagocytosed PM 10 (coronary arteries: r = 0. 53, p < 0. 05; aorta: r = 0. 51, p < 0. 05). Exposure to PM 10 also caused an increase in plaque cell turnover and extracellular lipid pools in coronary and aortic lesions, as well as in the total amount of lipids in aortic lesions. ConclusionsProgression of atherosclerosis and increased vulnerability to plaque rupture may underlie the relationship between particulate air pollution and excess cardiovascular death...|$|R
40|$|The {{role of the}} {{tripeptide}} glutathione in {{the growth}} and survival of Escherichia coli cells has been investigated. Glutathione-deficient mutants leak potassium and have a reduced cytoplasmic pH. These mutants are more sensitive to methylglyoxal than the parent strain, indicating that {{in the absence of}} glutathione-dependent detoxification, acidification of the cytoplasm cannot fully protect cells. However, increasing the intracellular pH of the glutathione-deficient strain resulted in enhanced sensitivity to methylglyoxal. This suggests that acidification of the cytoplasm can provide some protection to E. coli cells in the absence of glutathione. In the presence of the Kdp system, glutathione-deficient mutants are highly sensitive to methylglyoxal. This is due to the higher intracellular pH in these cells. In the absence of methylglyoxal, the presence of the Kdp system in a glutathione-deficient strain also leads to an extended lag upon dilution into fresh medium. These data highlight the importance of glutathione for the regulation <b>of</b> the K+ <b>pool</b> and survival <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to methylglyoxal...|$|R

40|$|Rating {{collateralised}} debt obligations (CDOs), {{which are}} based on tranched <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> credit risk <b>exposures,</b> does not only require attributing a probability of default to each obligor within the portfolio.

In this paper, we explain one of the most well-known models for rating CDOs, the so-called binomial expansion technique (BET).

The remainder of the paper talks about potential implications of certain model assumptions for ratings accuracy, that is the "model risk" taken by investors when acquiring CDO tranches, and whether and under what conditions methodological differences may generate incentives for issuers to strategically select rating agencies to get particular CDO structures rated.

40|$|Aims The SCORE {{project was}} {{initiated}} {{to develop a}} risk scoring system {{for use in the}} clinical management of cardiovascular risk in European clinical practice. Methods and results The project assembled a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> datasets from 12 European cohort studies, mainly carried out in general population settings. There were 205 178 persons (88 080 women and 117 098 men) representing 2. 7 million person years of follow-up. There were 7934 cardiovascular deaths, of which 5652 were deaths from coronary heart disease. Ten-year risk of fatal cardiovascular disease was calculated using a Weibull model in which age was used as a measure <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> time to risk rather than as a risk factor. Separate estimation equations were calculated fo...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge {{concerning}} aetiologic hypotheses can {{be obtained}} through systematic reviews of observational studies. In observational studies, heterogeneity between studies is expected, because of differences in study design and analysis. Data from observational studies {{have to be made}} comparable before <b>pooling</b> <b>of</b> results from component studies is possible. In this, definition <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> and disease and adjustment for confounding have to be taken into account. Three methods to deal with heterogeneity are presented: ignoring (fixed effects model), modelling (random effects model) and exploring (meta regression). Any combination of data in meta-analysis of observational studies has to be based on statistical, methodological and clinical considerations. The same considerations are applied for the choice which method is use...|$|R

40|$|Reduction <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to sensitising agents causing {{occupational}} asthma {{has been}} proposed {{as an alternative to}} total avoidance in order to minimise the adverse socio-economic impact of the condition. The aim of this systematic review was to compare the effects of these two management options on asthma and socio-economic outcomes. A bibliographic search was conducted to identify studies examining the outcome of workers with occupational asthma after reduction or cessation <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to the causal agent. The changes in asthma symptoms and nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness after reduction or cessation <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> were described in nine and five studies, respectively. The meta-analysis <b>of</b> <b>pooled</b> data showed that a reduction <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> was associated with a lower likelihood of improvement (OR 0. 16, 95 % CI 0. 03 - 0. 91) and recovery (OR 0. 30, 95 % CI 0. 11 - 0. 84) of asthma symptoms and a higher risk of worsening of the symptoms (OR 10. 23, 95 % CI 2. 97 - 35. 28) and nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness (OR 5. 65, 95 % CI 1. 11 - 28. 82), compared with complete avoidance <b>of</b> <b>exposure.</b> This systematic review indicates that reduction <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> cannot be routinely recommended as an alternative to cessation <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> in the management of occupational asthma. However, further investigations are required before drawing evidence-based conclusions on the cost-effectiveness of this approach...|$|R
