In {{terms of the}} number of cavities and their total volume, the interfaces formed in these complexes are akin to those in transient protein–protein heterocomplexes. With homodimeric proteins protein–DNA interfaces may contain cavities involving both the protein subunits and DNA, and these are more than twice as large as cavities involving a single protein subunit and DNA. A parameter, cavity index, measuring the degree of surface complementarity, indicates that the <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> <b>atoms</b> in protein–protein/DNA/RNA is very similar, but it is about two times less efficient in the permanent interfaces formed between subunits in homodimers.

At the nanoscale, the <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> <b>atoms</b> affects the chemical and structural properties of the material and, hence, its potential applications. This report describes the experimental formation of 5 -fold nanostructures by the packing of interpenetrated icosahedral and decahedral units. These nanowires, formed by the reaction of a mixture of metal salts (Au and Ag) in the presence of oleylamine, are obtained when the chemical composition is specifically Ag/Au = 3 : 1. The experimental images of the icosahedral nanowires have a high likelihood with simulated electron micrographs of structures formed by two or three Boerdijk Coxeter Bernal helices roped on a single structure, whereas for the decahedral wires, simulations using a model of adjacent decahedra match the experimental structures. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the synthesis of nanowires formed by the packing of structures with 5 -fold symmetry.

40|$|A {{molecular}} dynamics simulation study of four lipid bilayers with inserted trans-membrane helical fragment of epithelial growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGF peptide) was performed. The lipid bilayers differ in their lipid composition and consist of (i) unsaturated phosphatidylcholine (palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine, POPC), (ii) POPC and 20 mol% of cholesterol (Chol), (iii) sphingomyelin (SM) and 20 mol% of Chol, and (iv) SM and 50 mol% of Chol. Only 1 out of 26 residues in the EGF-peptide sequence is polar (Thr). The hydrophobic thickness of each bilayer is different but shorter than {{the length of the}} peptide and so, due to hydrophobic mismatch, the inserted peptide is tilted in each bilayer. Additionally, in the POPC bilayer, which is the thinnest, the peptide loses its helical structure in a short three-amino acid fragment. This facilitates bending of the peptide and burying all hydrophobic amino acids inside the membrane core (Figure 1 (b)). Bilayer lipid composition affects interactions between the peptide and lipids in the membrane core. Chol increases <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> <b>atoms</b> relative to the peptide side chains, and thus increases van der Waals interactions. On average, the packing around the peptide is higher in SM-based bilayers than POPC-based bilayers but for certain amino acids, packing depends on their position relative to the bilayer center. In the bilayer center, packing is higher in POPC-based bilayers, while in regions closer to the interface packing is higher in SM-based bilayers. In general, amino acids with larger side chains interact strongly with lipids, and thus the peptide sequence is important for the pattern of interactions at different membrane depths. This pattern closely resembles the shape of recently published lateral pressure profiles [Ollila et alJ. Struct. Biol. DOI: 10. 1016 /j. jsb. 2007. 01. 012].

40|$|The {{interfacial}} {{energy of}} boundaries between dissimilar materials {{can be described}} as function of the lattice mismatch, the chemical interaction and the interfacial entropy of the boundaries. Based on experiments involving a sphere-rotation method and undercooling measurements of (solid/liquid) phase mixtures in a droplet dispersion, an attempt is made to separate the influence of the different contributions. The atomic structure of interphase boundaries between noble metals and ionic crystals can be described by the "lock-in" model : low energy interphase boundaries were found if close <b>packed</b> rows <b>of</b> <b>atoms</b> at the "surface" of the metal crystal lock into the "valleys" between close <b>packed</b> rows <b>of</b> <b>atoms</b> at the "surface" of the ionic crystal. At higher temperatures the relative stability of different interphase boundary structures may change depending on the degree of axial commensuration and the related interfacial entropies. Hence, the contribution of lattice matching to the interfacial energy can decrease or vanish completely in some cases, resulting in a commensurate/incommensurate phase transition (e. g. for Au/Al 2 O 3). Furthermore, the droplet undercooling experiments demonstrate that good matching between two crystal lattices (substrate/nucleus) can favour formation of metastable phases due to the lowering of the activation barrier for nucleation during crystallization from a highly undercooled liquid...|$|R

40|$|The slow {{refolding}} of guanidine-HCl-denatured ribonuclease-A was {{studied by}} volume change and by kinetic CD at 222 and 276 nm. Dilatometric measurements revealed that on refolding {{there is a}} fast volume change of + 232 mL/mol of protein. This {{is followed by a}} very slow nonexponential change that takes about 25 min to reach equilibrium. By adding varying amounts of (NH 4) 2 SO 4, the slow volume change curve was resolved into 2 concurrent reactions. The faster of the 2 slow events entails a negative volume change of - 64 mL/mol of protein and appears to arise from proline isomerization. The slower process, attended by a positive change of + 53 mL/mol of protein, has properties consistent with the "XY" reaction of Lin and Brands (1983, Biochemistry 22 : 563 - 573). This reaction is so named because the conformational nature of neither its initial (Y) nor its final state (X) is known; the transition is characterized solely by its absorbance and fluorescence kinetics. These are the first direct physical measures attributable to the "XY" process. The early formation of a compact structure in the event responsible for the rapid + 232 -mL/mol volume change, however, is consistent with the sequential model of folding (Cook KH, Schmid FX, Baldwin RL, 1979, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 76 : 6157 - 6161; Kim PS, Baldwin RL, 1980, Biochemistry 19 : 6124 - 6129). The usefulness of volume change measurements as a method of detecting structural rearrangements was confirmed by finding agreement between time constants obtained from parallel volume change and kinetic CD experiments. The measured volume changes arise from both changes in hydration and changes in the <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> <b>atoms</b> in the interior of the protein...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of Al-based metallic glasses capable of easily generating an amorphous structure on cooling from the melt {{is recognized as}} one of the major challenges in this field of research. In the past, the Al-based amorphous alloys could be categorized into four types: (1) Al-LTM-RE; (2) Al- LTM- ETM; (3) Al-LTMAEM and (4) Al-TM-Metalloid. Recent findings in Al-rich Al-Ni-Co-La-Y alloys, where a critical casting diameter of ~ 1 mm has been reported, has rekindled interest in the possibility of producing Al-based bulk metallic glasses (BMGs). The research outlined in this thesis is focused on the design of Al-Si-based metallic glasses without rare earth elemental additions but having good glass-forming ability (GFA). Based on the underlying thermodynamic and kinetic factors that dictate the retention of a glassy structure in an alloy melt upon cooling, three fundamental concepts were simultaneously adopted in order to identify alloy compositions with the highest propensity for glass-formation in a range of Al-Si-based alloy systems. These incorporate the heat of mixing between alloying elements, the thermodynamic driving force for crystallization within an alloy system and the efficient <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> <b>atoms</b> for maximizing alloy melt viscosity, thereby slow down the kinetics of crystallisation. With this in mind, transition metals Cr, Mo, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni, were selected as viable additions to the binary Al-Si alloy system. Compositions that satisfy these criteria were produced by arc-melting and vacuum casting into wedge-shaped copper moulds in order to examine their GFA. The microstructure and morphology of the as-cast alloys were investigated mainly using electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction techniques. Results showed that glass formation is possible within the systems studied, with alloys in the Al-Ni-Si and Al-Co-Si systems forming glasses with a critical casting size of up to 400 um and 195 um, respectively. The GFA of the alloy systems studied in the thesis were found to follow the sequence: Al-Ni-Si > Al-Co-Si > Al-Cr-Si > Al-Mo-Si > Al-Mn-Si > Al-Fe-Si. The results indicate that the nature of the electronic bonding between Al and the transition metal elements strongly affects GFA of a given alloy system and that atomic packing efficiency also contributes to maximizing glass formation. The optimized compositions in the Al-Ni-Si alloys contained three types of efficiently packed clusters, which suggested a self-consistence principle that the compositions with all elements efficiently packed by their first-shell atoms are crystallization resistant and more likely to form a glass. Wider featureless regions were observed in the Al-rich lower liquidus temperature regions, indicating a lower crystallization driving force, which is a positive factor in potential glass formation. By carefully design and synthesis, the GFA in the Al-Si based alloys was explored, providing an insight towards the {{development of}} Al-based alloys free of rare-earth elements...|$|E
40|$|We {{have been}} engaged in a study by {{dielectric}} relaxation of molecular mobility in glasses made from molecular and fused Salt liquids [1, 2]. Our frequency range, 102 - 105 Hz, is sensitive to molecular rearrangements in the highly supercooled condition, {{in the vicinity of the}} glass transition temperature. In glasses composed of organic high polymers, in addition to the main molecular rearrangements whose slowing down on cooling is the origin of the glass transition, one often observes other molecular processes taking place at higher frequencies at any given measuring temperature. These have been attributed to the presence in the polymer molecule of internally hindered motions of specific chemical groups such as side-chains which slow down at a different rate from the main chain motions and thus can be resolved from them [3]. The molecular glasses we studied were composed of rigid molecules, lacking either side chains or any other internal degrees of freedom capable of giving rise to a relaxation by the mechanism traditionally invoked for the polymers. The results revealed a surprising and very uniform pattern : some three-quarters of the molecular glasses show a second relaxation region (the β-process) that consistently occurs at a temperature about 0. 7 to 0. 8 of Tg for a measuring frequency of 1 kHz, is more spread out in frequency than the main (α) molecular process, has about 1 / 5 to 1 / 10 the strength of the a-process, and an activation energy in the range of 0. 2 - 0. 4 eV. Some three quarters of amorphous high polymers show a process with characteristics so similar that it is not possible by examination of the experimental dielectric data to tell whether the molecule in question is a polymer bearing side chains or a small rigid molecule. Our conclusion was that the secondary (β) process is a characteristic feature of amorphous packing. This conclusion has not so far been widely accepted. Evidence against it is as follows : (1) Silicate glasses have not been shown to possess a β-relaxation; (2) we have no explanation for the fact that some 25 % of our rigid molecule systems fail to show such a relaxation [3]. A few metal alloy glasses have been studied by the analogous method of mechanical spectroscopy : The results have been inconclusive. Chen et al. have studied a Pd-Au-Si alloy and not found a secondary relaxation [4]; Eisenberg and Reich have studied Pd-Si and Pd-Au-Si alloys and found relaxations whose presence or absence was highly sensitive to sample history [5]. In spite of these facts we feel the weight of the evidence is on the side of our basic conclusion. Structural studies on glasses have most often been interpreted in terms of the random network model. Recent evidence on the stability of small clusters of particles [6, 7, 8] has raised an alternate possibility that glasses are composed of amorphous clusters : aggregates of high density and low energy that lack the symmetry needed for long range periodic packing. Such a structure would require a somewhat looser <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> <b>atoms</b> or molecules in the interstices between the amorphous clusters, a feature graphically referred to as connective tissue. In contrast to the random network model, in which all the atoms or molecular units are in essentially equivalent local environments, the amorphous cluster model requires two different environments in the structure. The usual tools of structure analysis have not so far given a definitive answer to the question of whether there are one or two types of local environments in amorphous solids, and it is not yet clear whether the resolving power of these tools is adequate to the problem. The results we have cited above on molecular mobility in glasses provides evidence for the existence of two types of environments, and may be plausibly interpreted therefore as support for the amorphous cluster model...|$|E

The case studies show that these defect features {{could lead to a}} misinterpretation of X-ray intensity data. The structural interpretations obtained from these XSRD analyses could be significantly different when physical properties of the crystals are considered. In the second part of my dissertation, comparative crystal chemical studies on mantle-derived minerals such as spinel, clinopyroxene, and olivine are reported. These studies were carried out to examine temperature, pressure, and compositional effects on the structures of these phases. In particular, <b>packing</b> arrangements <b>of</b> oxygen <b>atoms</b> were examined in detail to investigate how the packing affects element partitioning among upper-mantle minerals. At ambient conditions, oxygen packing is more distorted in the order of spinel < olivine < clinopyroxene. The <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> oxygen <b>atoms</b> in olivine might have a significant control on element substitutions at high pressure. Because elements whose radius is larger than that of Mg distort the <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> mantle olivine (Fo~ 89), olivine might limit the amount of those elements, such as Fe 2 +, entering the structure. In contrast, substitutions of smaller cations in C 2 /c clinopyroxenes increase packing distortion. For clinopyroxenes enclosed in peridotite and eclogite, higher equilibration pressures are associated with more distorted, less efficiently packed structures. Unlike many minerals reported in Thompson and Downs (2001), spinel becomes more packed with rising temperature when intracrystalline cation exchange reactions are possible. Despite wide chemical variations, spinel samples from one geological environment display a constant packing distortion, which might suggest that spinel is capable of achieving an optimal packing configuration at a given P and T...|$|R

In particular, the <b>packing</b> density <b>of</b> <b>atoms</b> is highly similar between different proteins, which allows for building a pseudo-atomic model to approximate the true mass distribution. From this model the radial structure factor and density value histogram are estimated and applied as constraints to the 3 D reconstruction in reciprocal- and real-space, respectively. Interestingly, similar improvements are obtained when using the correct radial structure factor and density value histogram from a crystal structure. Thus, the estimated pseudo-atomic model yields a sufficiently accurate mass distribution to optimally sharpen a density map...|$|R
40|$|The <b>packing</b> <b>of</b> protein <b>atoms</b> is an {{indicator}} for their stability and functionality, and applied in determining thermostability, in protein design, ligand binding {{and to identify}} flexible regions in proteins. Here, we present Voronoia, a database <b>of</b> atomic-scale <b>packing</b> data for protein 3 D structures. It {{is based on an}} improved Voronoi Cell algorithm using hyperboloid interfaces to construct atomic volumes, and to resolve solvent-accessible and -inaccessible regions <b>of</b> <b>atoms.</b> The database contains atomic volumes, local packing densities and interior cavities calculated for 61 318 biological units from the PDB. A report for each structure summarizes the packing by residue and atom types, and lists the environment of interior cavities. The packing data are compared to a nonredundant set of structures from SCOP superfamilies. Both packing densities and cavities can be visualized in the 3 D structures by the Jmol plugin. Additionally, PDB files can be submitted to the Voronoia server for calculation. This service performs calculations for most full-atomic protein structures within a few minutes. For batch jobs, a standalone version of the program with an optional PyMOL plugin is available for download. The database can be freely accessed at: [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The volume {{changes of}} cesium under {{pressure}} are discussed {{with respect to}} the <b>packing</b> density <b>of</b> the <b>atoms</b> and valence. The element is univalent in densely packed Cs I and Cs II. Valence increases in Cs III (packing density q = 0. 973), in Cs IV (q = 0. 943), in Cs V (q ~ 0. 99), and in close packed Cs VI. The diminuition of volume beyond ~ 15 GPa is caused by this increase only which implies that electrons of the fifth shell act as valence electrons...|$|R
