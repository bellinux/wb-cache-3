50|$|The Crick Crack Club {{holds the}} Heritage Lottery Fund funded LCIS audio archive of {{performance}} storytelling, which totals over 900 individual recordings, {{each with its}} own annotated record. It features over 220 voices, and spans a period from 1983 to 2007. As a study of a reviving art form based on the oral tradition, the material ranges from the raw and experimental, to the polished and formally presented. Most of the material in the archive was originally recorded on an ad hoc basis, with little strategic or long-term view. The archive includes recordings from the experimental club-nights run by The West London Storytelling Unit in London in the early 1980s; material collected by The Company of Storytellers dating from their first tour in 1985 and onwards; recordings collected at the first three UK International Storytelling Festivals in London in 1985, 87 and 89; from Beyond the Border Festival over the years and some more recent recordings from Festival at the Edge, the Barbican Arts Centre and the Unicorn Theatre. It features over 220 voices, including that of Hugh Lupton, TUUP, Sally Pomme Clayton, Ben Haggarty, Abbi <b>Patrix</b> and Laura Simms, as well as superb examples of some of the world's greatest surviving epic singing traditions such as Central Indian Pandavani, Rajasthani Pabuji Ki Phad, Kyrgyz Manas singing (singers of the epic of Manas), the work of Turkish Ashiks and Bangladeshi Palagan and Patuagan performers.|$|E
50|$|The Crick Crack Club was {{the first}} {{performance}} storytelling club to be established in the UK. From 1988-1995 26 weekly events took place every autumn and winter. Artists received fees to entertain an audience who had paid an entry fee. Unlike folk clubs there were no ‘floorspots’; from the outset the Crick Crack Club only promoted professional artists and did not encourage amateur participation. It was founded in 1987 by performance storyteller Ben Haggarty with assistance {{during the first year}} from Jenny Pearson. In January 1985 Ben Haggarty had organised Britain's first storytelling festival at Battersea Arts Centre - the success of this and a second festival at Watermans Art Centre in 1987 prompted an invitation for him to stage a third, 16-day-long, international storytelling festival at London's South Bank Centre in 1989. A list of international artists was drawn up, including Louise Bennett, Vi Hilbert, Abbi <b>Patrix,</b> Eamon Kelly, Seref Tasliova and Punaram Nishad. However, questions arose as to whether there would actually be enough performance storytellers in the UK with the experience and stage presence to hold large adult audiences for a whole evening with appropriate material. This concern led Ben Haggarty to found the Crick Crack Club. Many of today’s leading British storytellers first cut their teeth on adult audiences at the Crick Crack Club. In the autumn of 1988 the first season of 26 weekly events was launched in a pub theatre in Ladbroke Grove, with the expressed aim of trying out new artists and providing an opportunity for established artists (who mainly worked in educational contexts) to develop their skills and repertoire for adult audiences.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze and compare {{scanning}} electron microscopy (SEM) observations of ball attachments that had been worn by patients during three periods of clinical use. One hundred forty-four specimens of ball anchor attachments (gold alloy matrix and titanium <b>patrix)</b> were studied by SEM after periods of approximately 1, 3. 5, and 8 years of clinical use. Twenty new attachment components were examined as controls. SEM images revealed signs of mechanical wear for the ball attachments studied. The surfaces of the titanium <b>patrix</b> were associated primarily with roughening after short-term use, whereas surfaces of the gold alloy matrix showed wear, roughening, and loss of microscopic material in the form of flakes. Severe mechanical wear on both surfaces was noted after longer periods of use. The mechanical changes were not correlated with patient-mediated observations regarding the time-dependent retentive efficacy of the attachments. One year of clinical wear appeared to have limited effect on the ball attachment tested. Conversely, longer periods of use led to marked modifications in shape of the matrix and <b>patrix</b> components. Int J Prosthodont 2011; 24 : 270 - 272. ITI foundatio...|$|E

40|$|The {{rehabilitation}} {{of a patient}} in the Kennedy class IV situation demands biomechanical balance and aesthetic improvement. The long-span condition complicates the problem because of the unavailability of sufficient number of abutments to support the prosthesis.

This report describes a novel technique for the fabrication of a custom attachment to retain prosthesis. An acrylic resin removable partial denture (RPD) is retained by a custom attachment. The <b>patrix</b> part of the custom attachment is fabricated using molar bands, prefabricated circumferential clasp, and straight die pins. The matrix part of the attachment is constituted by the plastic sleeves of the straight die pins, which are embedded inside the tissue-fitting surface of the prosthesis.

40|$|In this {{prospective}} {{clinical study}} on 40 patients with similar clinical conditions (edentulous jaw with 2 interforaminal implants) commercially available ceramic ball attachments (ruby) {{were compared to}} commercial titanium ball attachments. The primary aim {{of the study was}} to measure the wear of the ball attachments after being 1 year in function. However, in the course of the study already after 7 to 12 months multiple failures with ceramic ball attachments occurred. Twelve (28 %) of 43 ceramic ball attachments had to be replaced, mostly because of fractures (8) of the ceramic ball. It seems that ceramic ball attachments of the investigated design are not able to withstand normal intraoral stresses. The short-term susceptibility to fractures didn't allow to examine the ceramic-inherent features such as compressive strength and wear resistance. Furthermore, a secure connection between a titan base and a ceramic ball seems to be challenging. Based on these results, in implant-retained removable prosthesis the use of metal-based retainers is still recommended, although during maintenance a higher wear has to be expected.

40|$|P>The aim of {{this study}} was to {{validate}} an original portable device to measure attachment retention of implant overdentures both in the lab and in clinical settings. The device was built with a digital force measurement gauge (Imada) secured to a vertical wheel stand associated with a customized support to hold and position the denture in adjustable angulations. Sixteen matrix and <b>patrix</b> cylindrical stud attachments (Locator (R)) were randomly assigned as in vitro test specimens. Attachment abutments were secured in an implant analogue hung to the digital force gauge or to the load cell of a traction machine used as the gold standard (Instron Universal Testing Machine). Matrices were secured in a denture duplicate attached to the customized support, permitting reproducibility of their position on both pulling devices. Attachment retention in the axial direction was evaluated by measuring maximum dislodging force or peak load during five consecutive linear dislodgments of each attachment on both devices. After a wear simulation, retention was measured again at several time periods. The peak load measurements with the customized Imada device were similar to those obtained with the gold standard Instron machine. These findings suggest that the proposed portable device can provide accurate information on the retentive properties of attachment systems for removable dental prostheses.

40|$|Although {{immediate}} implantation has {{not been}} previously recommended in infected sites, it is now becoming a procedure of choice in modern implant dentistry. We report {{a case of a}} 65 -year-old male patient, who required multiple tooth extractions in the lower jaw and fabrication of a new overdenture in the lower jaw and a complete denture in the upper jaw. Immediate implantation in infected tooth sockets followed extraction. Two NobelReplace™ Tapered implants (Nobel BioCare, Zürich, Switzerland), one 13 mm long and 4. 3 mm wide and the other 13 mm long and 5. 0 mm wide, were placed in the position 33 and 43. The site was sutured and a temporary denture was fabricated by adjusting the old denture. After a period of three months the implant site was reopened and healing abutments were placed. Impressions were made using the Impregum Penta Soft (3 M ESPE, St. Paul, Minn, USA) polyether material. Ball Abutment Titanium™ was used as a <b>patrix</b> attachment and a matrix was inserted into the denture. Clinical examination and x-ray analysis after six months showed no significant changes of the implants. Bone resorption was within standard values. Although it is still a controversial subject, immediate implantation in infected sites can be a safe and predictable procedure if surgical protocols are followed. However, {{further research is needed to}} draw firm conclusions...|$|E
40|$|The demographical {{development}} {{of the population has}} also an influence on the number and image of the potential patients in dental offices: in the near future the rate of geriatric patients, looking for alternatives to improve an insufficient retention of the pre-existing prosthesis, due to an alveolar ridge atrophy, by using implants in combination with residual dentition will in total increase. Purpose: The aim of this prospective clinical trial was to evaluate the long-term behaviour of overdentures retained by an innovative telescopic retainer system named SynCone (Dentsply, Friadent, Germany). The unique property of this retainer is its prefabricated male and female part. Material and method: 23 patients (15 f, 8 m, ~ age 61. 6 years +- 12. 9 SD) were included in this study. After 3 drop-outs 21 overdentures (9 mandible, 12 maxillae, retained by 91 Ankylos-lmplants and 6 teeth) were evaluated during 36 months of function. All implants were loaded after a healing period of 3 months in the lower and 5 months in the upper jaw. The common insertion path of the cone <b>patrix</b> is easily achieved by a free rotation od an angulated abutment. The index-free, implant abutment joint (angulated syncone-abutment) is anti-rotational locked by a high friction grip after tightening the implant-abutment connecting screw. The prefabricated cone matrix (SynCone®-coping) was definitively assembled intraorally with a splinting frame of CoCrMo using a self curing resin. Several clinical parameters were examined during the follow-up examinations: retention, fit and maintenance of the denture; osseointegration (Periotest? and periimplant soft tissue condition (PeriotronB). Additionally a questionnaire of the participants took place every appointment. The data are statistically processed by the software STATlSTlCA (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, USA). Results: One implant in the lower jaw was lost after 25 months (survival rate 98. 91 %). The Periotest® values improved significantly (Tukey test, p< 0. 05) between the day of denture insertion and 6 months later and remain stable. The soft tissue condition shows healthy conditions according the PeriotronB values: Tukey test, p< 0. 05, significant difference between the initial values and the values 36 -months under function. Three (3) patients show initially pressure spots, but there was no further occurrence during the whole observation time. A relining of the dentures was not necessary. The retention force was scored as to high (6 implants, upper jaw) and as to low (2 implants, lower jaw) at two patients each. After 3 years {{there is a lack of}} technical failures of the implants and an aftercare of the teeth abutments. The questionnaire shows a significant difference (Wilcoxon-test) between the old and the new denture according the patient's general satisfaction, the fit, the retention, the wearing comfort and the chewing comfort. No difference was detected at the hygiene ability. The relative manufacture time in the dental laboratory of a denture retained by 4 SynCone® abutments was reduced in average to 52. 82 % compared to the conventional customized, casted double crowns. Discussion The results of the recent prospective clinical study show that double crown based removable prosthesis retained on SynCone® abutments demonstrate a similar clinical performance to fixed implant retained prostheses: two weeks after insertion there are no more pressure spots occurrences, prostheses show no micro-movement, which is also confirmed by the patients, which describes the overdentures "as similar as the own dentition". Furthermore, the posterior extension of the denture base acts as cantilever of a fixed construction. The absence of complications related to implant component's overloading such as abutment loosening andlor fractures give a further evidence of an anchorage free of micro-movements. This type of rigid anchorage of implant retained overdentures can be achieved by using tapered connectioris (double crown principle) with high accuracy of fit after their integration (intraoral cementation) into a metal framework. As well the pre-fabricated components as the applied intraoral cementation provide the final construction with a remarkable passivity of fit and stability, which is predictable and easily reproducible. Moreover, with the prefabricated components almost the half of the dental technician's time needed for the manufacture can be saved and consequently a reduction of the manufacturing costs of the entire therapy can be achieved. However, a symmetrical topography of attachment's distribution is required. In case with two implants placed interforaminal the opposite jaw should only be provided with a full denture, in order to avoid an overload of the implants. Additionally, the results of this prospective clinical trial show that well-known results and clinical outcomes of the use of cone crowns such as integration of residual dentition, the easy hygiene and handling, the excellent wearing and chewing comfort as well the easy modification of the prostheses in cases of attachment losses, can be one-to-one transferred to the clinical outcomes we observed by using the SynCone attachment for implant retained overdentures. Conclusion The SynCone® system allows an efficient manufacturing of implant retained overdentures with an easy access of hygiene for the implants and an optimal accuracy of fit. Therefore, this type of denture achieves a high degree of quality in a simple, reproducible and cost effective manner simulating the involved tissues and the patient the advantages of a fixed bridge. However, some minor improvements of the prefabricated retainer are necessary to achieve a sufficient retention by using only two implants. Die demographische Entwicklung beeinflusst sowohl die Anzahl als auch den Typ von Patienten in Zahnarztpraxen: in naher Zukunft wird vor allem der Anteil von alten und sehr alten Patienten zunehmen, die aktiv um eine Verbesserung des aufgrund ihrer atrophierten Alveolarkämme insuffizienten Prothesenhalts nachfragen und hierzu neben ihrer Restbezahnung vor allem die Nutzung von Implantaten wünschen. Ziel Das Ziel dieser prospektiven klinischen Studie ist die Evaluation des Langzeitverhaltens von implantatgestützten Deckprothesen, die mit einem innovativen Konuskronensystems namens SynCone® (Dentsply, Friadent, Germany) verankert sind. Das Alleinstellungsmerkmal dieses Haltelements ist eine präfabrizierte Patrize und Matrize. Material und Methode An dieser Studie nahmen 23 Patienten (15 m, 83 w, ~ Alter: 61, 6 Jahre +- 12. 9 SD) teil. Nach 3 drop-outs konnten 21 Deckprothesen (9 Unterkiefer, 12 Oberkiefer, gestützt auf insgesamt 91 Ankylos®-lmplantaten und 6 Zähnen) während einer 36 -monatigen Funktionsperiode regelmäßig evaluiert werden. Die im Unterkiefer inserierten Implantate wurden nach einer dreimonatigen, die im Oberkiefer nach einer fünfmonatigen Einheilungszeit belastet. Die gemeinsame Einschubrichtung der konischen Patrizen ist einfach durch ein uneingeschränktes Drehen eines abgewinkelten Abutments (SynCone®-Abutmen) zu erzielen, das zum Implantat eine Index freie Verbindung aufweist. Die erforderliche, sichere Rotationsblockierung eines in Einschubrichtung ausgerichteten SynCone®-Abutments wird durch eine hohe Haftreibung erzielt, die beim Festschrauben des Abutments zwischen den Fügeflächen der internen Implantat-Abutment Konusverbindung entsteht. Die präfabrizierten Matrizen (SynCone®-Kappen) werden gleichzeitig und intraoral mit einem selbst härtenden Kunststoff in das Prothesengerüst aus CoCrMo eingeklebt. Folgende klinische Parameter wurden während der Nachuntersuchungen erhoben: Haftung, Passung und erforderlicher Nachsorgeaufwand der Deckprothesen; Osseointegration der Implantate (Periotest®) und der Zustand des periimplantären Weichgewebes (Periotron®). Zudem wurde von den Studienteilnehmern bei jedem Untersuchungstermin ein Fragebogen ausgefüllt. Die statistische Auswertung erfolgte mit der Software STATISTICA (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, USA). Ergebnisse Ein Implantat im Unterkiefer ging nach 25 Monaten verloren (Überlebensrate: 98, 91 %). Die Periotest®Werte verbesserten sich statistisch signifikant (Tukey test, pc 0. 05) zwischen dem Einsetzdatum der neuen Prothese und aller darauf folgenden Nachkontrollen. Das Weichgewebe verbesserte seinen Zustand anhand der Periotron® Werte signifikant zwischen dem Einsetzdatum und nach 36 Monaten (Tukey Test, p< 0. 05). Druckstellen traten während der 36 -monatigen Beobachtungszeit ausschließlich initial bei drei (3) Patienten auf, eine Unterfüttung war bei keinem Patienten erforderlich. Bei zwei (2) Patienten wurde eine zu hohe Haftkraft der Oberkieferprothese auf 6 lmplantaten festgestellt, bei zwei (2) Patienten war die Haftkraft der Unterkieferprothese auf 2 lmplantaten zu gering. Nach 3 Jahren traten weder technische Misserfolge bei den lmplantaten noch Folgebehandlungen der Pfeilerzähne auf. Die Auswertung der Fragebögen zeigte einen signifikanten Unterschied (Wilcoxon-Test) zwischen der alten und neuen Prothese bezüglich der allgemeinen Zufriedenheit, der Passgenauigkeit, der Haftkraft, des Trage- und des Kaukomforts. Die Hygienefähigkeit wurde nicht unterschiedlich bewertet. Die Herstellungszeit einer auf 4 SynCone® Abutments verankerten Prothese konnte in 12 befragten zahntechnischen Labors im Vergleich zu Prothesen mit individuell gefertigten, gegossenen Konuskronen auf durchschnittlich 52. 82 % reduziert werden. Diskussion Die Ergebnisse dieser prospektiven klinischen Studie zeigen, dass auf präfabrizierte Konuskronen des SynCone® Systems verankerte Deckprothesen eine vergleichbare Performance als festsitzender Zahnersatz aufweisen: es treten zwei Wochen nach Eingliederung keine Druckstellen mehr auf, die Prothesen sind frei von Mikrobewegungen, bestätigt durch die Patienten als „fester Zahnersatz". Zudem wirkt die posteriore Extension der Prothese über den Freiendsattel als weitspanniger Freiendpontik einer festsitzenden Konstruktion. Das Ausbleiben von technischen Implantatversagen augrund einer Überbelastung beweist zudem eine mikrobewegungsfreie Verankerung der Prothese. Diese Art der steifen, rein implantatgestützten Verankerung kann durch die Verwendung von Konusverbindungen (Doppelkronen-Prinzip) erzielt werden, deren Matrizen mit einem exakt passenden Metallgerüst verbunden sind. Die klinische Realisation eines passiv und stabil sitzenden Prothesengerüsts wird sowohl durch die präfabrizierten Komponenten als auch durch die angewandte intraorale Verklebungstechnik leicht reproduzierbar und damit vorhersagbar. Zusätzlich kann etwa die Hälfte der Arbeitszeit eines Zahntechnikers eingespart und dadurch eine erhebliche Reduktion der Therapiekosten erzielt werden. Jedoch ist eine symmetrische Topographie der lmplantate und gegebenenfalls der integrierten Pfeilerzähne erforderlich. Zwei interforaminal platzierte lmplantate sind nur bei einer Totalprothese im Oberkiefer indiziert, um eine Überbelastung der lmplantate zu vermeiden. Die Ergebnisse dieser prospektiven klinischen Studie zeigen außerdem, dass die bereits bekannten Vorteile von individuell gefertigten Konuskronen wie die Integration der Restbezahnung, die einfache Hygiene und Handhabung, der exzellente Trage- und Kaukomfort und die einfache Modifikation der Prothese im Falle eines Pfeilerverlustes, ohne Einschränkungen auf die klinischen Resultate von SynCone-verankerten Deckprothesen übertragen werden. Schlussfolgerung Das SynCone® System ermöglicht eine effiziente Herstellung von implantatverankerten Prothesen mit leichtem Hygiene-Zugang der lmplantate und mit einer optimalen Passgenauigkeit. Deshalb erzielt diese Art von herausnehmbarem Zahnersatz einen hohen, reproduzierbaren Grad an Qualität und bietet den beteiligten Gewebestrukturen und dem Patienten die Vorteile einer festsitzenden Brücke. Jedoch sind geringfügige Veränderungen an dem präfabrizierten Halteelement erforderlich um eine zufrieden stellende Retention auch bei nur zwei Implantaten zu erzielen...|$|E
