50|$|Vidicons, <b>Plumbicons,</b> {{and image}} intensifiers have {{specific}} applications. The {{speed at which}} they can be sampled depends upon the decay rate of the phosphor used. For example, the P46 phosphor has a decay time of less than 2 microseconds, while the P43 decay time is {{on the order of}} 2-3 milliseconds. The P43 is therefore unusable at frame rates above 1000 frames per second (frame/s). See External links for links to phosphor information.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, in 1934, Zworykin shared some patent rights with the German {{licensee}} company Telefunken. The [...] "image iconoscope" [...] ("Superikonoskop" [...] in Germany) was produced {{as a result}} of the collaboration. This tube is essentially identical to the super-Emitron. The production and commercialization of the super-Emitron and image iconoscope in Europe were not affected by the patent war between Zworykin and Farnsworth, because Dieckmann and Hell had priority in Germany for the invention of the image dissector, having submitted a patent application for their Lichtelektrische Bildzerlegerröhre für Fernseher (Photoelectric Image Dissector Tube for Television) in Germany in 1925, two years before Farnsworth did the same in the United States. The image iconoscope (Superikonoskop) became the industrial standard for public broadcasting in Europe from 1936 until 1960, when it was replaced by the vidicon and <b>plumbicon</b> tubes. Indeed, it was the representative of the European tradition in electronic tubes competing against the American tradition represented by the image orthicon. The German company Heimann produced the Superikonoskop for the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, later Heimann also produced and commercialized it from 1940 to 1955, finally the Dutch company Philips produced and commercialized the image iconoscope and multicon from 1952 to 1958.|$|E

40|$|Radiological fluoroscopy, using {{x-ray image}} intensifiers (XRII) and TV systems, {{is limited in}} visual noise or mottle by the {{requirement}} of minimizing radiation dose to the patient. Various methods {{have been used for}} making this noise more acceptable, such as using laggy vidicons (rather than <b>plumbicons)</b> or digital stores to integrate and thus reduce noise. Integration implies some motional blurring and this problem has to be balanced against noise reduction. In obtaining static images from such XRII-TV system, further choices come into play, (a) optical exposure time in the multiformat camera and (b) whether or not the radiation is pulsed. We have performed mottle and motion blurring evaluations on radiographic images produced during continuous fluoroscopy via TV systems (i. e. videofluorography) or directly from x-ray image intensifiers for various exposure times. These results are compared with each other and direct measurements of the TV system's temporal frequency response. It was found for the particular clinical system evaluated (Siemens 1023 line TV and Matrix Instruments FV 1 - 1 multiformat camera) that (a) TV generated noise was sufficiently high to require several TV frames to be integrated ont...|$|R

5000|$|In 1960 Philips invented an imaging tube {{called the}} <b>Plumbicon</b> {{to replace the}} vidicon and Image Orthicon tubes used in studio {{television}} cameras.

In 1967 the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences presented Philips with an Emmy Award for [...] "Outstanding Achievement in Engineering Development" [...] for the invention of the <b>Plumbicon</b> tube.|$|E
5000|$|This {{problem with}} <b>Plumbicon</b> tubes was already {{of concern in}} the early 1960s [...] and all the early <b>plumbicon</b> cameras {{suffered}} from it., including the EMI 2001. [...] With separate mesh tubes there was some improvement, because higher beam currents could be used without loss of resolution. [...] Some cameras introduced anti comet tail circuits to provide dynamic correction, when an overload was sensed (ACT circuits), but these were not used in the EMI 2001.|$|E
50|$|<b>Plumbicon</b> is a {{registered}} trademark of Philips for its Lead(II) oxide (PbO) target vidicons. Used frequently in broadcast camera applications, these tubes have low output, but a high signal-to-noise ratio. They had excellent resolution compared to Image Orthicons, but lacked the artificially sharp edges of IO tubes, which caused some of the viewing audience to perceive them as softer. CBS Labs invented the first outboard edge enhancement circuits to sharpen the edges of <b>Plumbicon</b> generated images.|$|E
5000|$|Marconi, {{following}} their visit to RCA, also promptly set {{about the development}} of a new 4-tube camera, similar in concept to the RCA one. However, this work was soon abandoned in favour of an all <b>Plumbicon</b> camera (the Mark VII camera), using the newly available <b>Plumbicon</b> camera tubes from Philips. The camera was completed in 9 months and was the first all-Plumbicon 4-tube camera to be available worldwide. [...] It was marketed in the US from February 1966 and achieved substantial sales there.|$|E
50|$|Compared to Saticons, Plumbicons {{had much}} higher {{resistance}} to burn in, and comet and trailing artifacts from bright {{lights in the}} shot. Saticons though, usually had slightly higher resolution. After 1980, {{and the introduction of}} the diode gun <b>plumbicon</b> tube, the resolution of both types was so high, compared to the maximum limits of the broadcasting standard, that the Saticon's resolution advantage became moot. While broadcast cameras migrated to solid state Charged Coupled Devices, <b>plumbicon</b> tubes remain a staple imaging device in the medical field.|$|E
50|$|In {{spite of}} the BBC’s lukewarm {{reception}} of the experimental camera EMI persisted with the 4-tube concept, but now using <b>Plumbicon</b> tubes, as suggested by Wood although there was some delay before the work started. There were several reasons for the delay. Firstly, EMI’s board hesitated to provide the financial investment needed for the project. Secondly, there was indecision regarding where to place the work but, eventually, the Colour TV Department of the Research Labs. was chosen in preference to the Broadcast Equipment Division (the existing supplier of EMI's monochrome cameras and studio equipment). Thirdly, there was concern regarding the reliability of supply of <b>Plumbicon</b> tubes, as Philips was the only supplier. Fourthly, there were concerns regarding the variable quality standards of the early <b>Plumbicon</b> pick-up tubes, as some tubes were found to produce unstable pictures. Although most issues with tube quality were quickly resolved by Philips, there remained concerns regarding 'comet tails' and 'blooming'.|$|E
50|$|The {{pictures}} from early <b>Plumbicon</b> cameras were susceptible to comet tails and blooming and, although these effects {{had not been}} a major concern in the previous generation of cameras, which employed vidicon or image orthicon tubes, they were an annoying feature of <b>Plumbicon</b> tubes. The problems arose when the beam current of a pick-up tube was insufficient to fully discharge the target in very bright areas of an image. Reducing the target voltage and increasing the beam current of the pick-up tube helped to mitigate the problem but, with early Plumbicons, this resulted in loss of resolution and increased lag.|$|E
5000|$|In 1950 {{the arrival}} of the Vidicon camera tube made smaller cameras possible. 1952 saw the first Walkie-Lookie [...] "portable cameras". Image Orthicon tubes were still used till {{the arrival of}} the <b>Plumbicon.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Philips Research Lab., {{following}} RCA's lead, also {{contemplated the}} construction of a four-tube camera. Their new camera was to include an experimental 2" [...] <b>Plumbicon</b> tube which was being developed for use in the luminance channel of this camera. The work was discontinued.|$|E
50|$|In the mid 1960s, {{following}} RCA’s lead, other {{versions of}} the 4-tube cameras were produced (see below for details). In many cases, advantage was taken of a newly available pick-up tube (the <b>Plumbicon).</b> This new tube allowed cameras to be smaller and lighter than before.|$|E
50|$|Philips {{invented the}} <b>plumbicon</b> pick up video camera tube in 1965; {{almost all of}} their color cameras used this award-winning tube. Starting with the LDK 90 camera, Philips used their Frame {{transfer}} CCD - Charge-coupled device. Philips' patented Dynamic Pixel Management (DPM) FT-17 CCD technology won awards and was first used in the 1994 LDK10 and LDK10p camera.|$|E

50|$|Color on AT&T's Picturephone was not {{employed}} {{with their}} early models. These Picturephone units packaged <b>Plumbicon</b> cameras and small CRT displays within their housings. The cameras were located atop their screens to help users {{see eye to}} eye. Later generation display screens were larger than in the original demonstration units, approximately six inches (15 cm) square in a roughly cubical cabinet.|$|E
50|$|The {{result was}} a slew of {{commercial}} and fundamental results, including the <b>Plumbicon</b> camera tube and the Video Long Play disc, which was the technological basis for the 1980 compact disc. Results were also achieved {{in the area of}} integrated circuitry: Else Kooi invented the LOCOS technology and Kees Hart and Arie Slob developed the I²L (Integrated Injection Logic) in the early 1970s.|$|E
5000|$|The {{problem was}} not satisfactorily {{resolved}} until the late 1960s when an extra ‘anti-comet-tail’ gun was introduced into <b>plumbicon</b> tubes. [...] New camera designs, produced in the 1970s, were able to include the new improved tubes, and usually did so. Some 2001 cameras were modified to take the new tubes, {{but it was a}} difficult retrofit procedure, because of the complexity of the additional circuitry.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Tompsett built a {{reflection}} high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) system to study surfaces. While at English Electric Valve(EEV), he {{built the first}} ultra-high-vacuum RHEED system with in-situ deposition to study the structures of thin-films of lead oxide as they were deposited. This understanding was needed to make <b>Plumbicon</b> television camera-tubes. He consulted with VacGen (now VG Scienta) to make a commercial system, {{the first of which}} was sold to IBM Labs.|$|E
50|$|Some {{optical sensors}} are {{designed}} to detect spatial differences in electromagnetic energy. These include photographic film, solid-state devices (CCD, CMOS detectors, and infrared detectors like PtSi and InSb), tube detectors (vidicon, <b>plumbicon,</b> and photomultiplier tubes used in night-vision devices), scanning detectors (mainly used for IR), pyroelectric detectors, and microbolometer detectors. The ability of such a detector to resolve those differences depends mostly {{on the size of}} the detecting elements.|$|E
50|$|After the EMI board granted {{approval}} for the new camera, in late 1964, work on it progressed rapidly. The camera was to use four <b>Plumbicon</b> pick-up tubes, to use solid state circuitry, include a zoom lens as standard and to use prism optics. After the late start, the first fully operational prototype was shown to the BBC and others in 1966, only {{just in time to}} meet BBC time-scales for the introduction of their new colour service.|$|E
50|$|However, {{by the end}} of the decade, 4-tube cameras {{had fallen}} out of favour with most {{manufactures}} and customers. The picture quality and stability of pictures from 3-tube cameras had improved markedly, thanks to solid state circuitry, improvements in the <b>Plumbicon</b> tubes and the use of picture enhancement techniques. In addition, 3-tube cameras were smaller, lighter and cheaper than the 4-tube versions. By the early1970s, only a very few manufacturers still made cameras using the 4-tube format.|$|E
5000|$|Philips' line of Norelco {{cameras were}} also {{very popular with}} models such as PC-60 (1965), PC-70 (1967) and PCP-90 (1968 Handheld). Philips/BTS-Broadcast Television Systems Inc. later came out with an LDK line of camera, like its last high end tube camera the LDK 6 (1982). Philips invented the <b>Plumbicon</b> pick up Video camera tube in 1965, that gave tube cameras a cleaner picture. BTS {{introduced}} its first HandHeld Frame transfer CCD- Charge-coupled device-CCD camera the LDK90 in 1987.|$|E
50|$|The EMI 2001 Broadcast studio {{camera was}} an early, very {{successful}} British made <b>Plumbicon</b> studio camera {{that included the}} lens within {{the body of the}} camera. Four 30 mm tubes allowed one tube to be dedicated solely to producing a relatively high resolution monochrome signal, with the other three tubes each providing red, green or blue signals. Even though semiconductors were used in most of the camera, the highly sensitive head amplifiers still used thermionic valves in the first generation of the design.|$|E
50|$|However, {{much of the}} insert {{material}} was still in black and white, as initially {{only a part of}} the film coverage shot in and around London was on colour reversal film stock, and all regional and many international contributions were still in black and white.

50|$|As Telearuba was {{preparing}} for its grand opening, the workers experienced {{a time of great}} anxiety and pressure. For example Philips Company performed a light testing with TL lights, however the type of camera available at that time <b>plumbicon</b> was not sensitive enough to project the right lighting for the screen. As a result, Telearuba was forced to supply studios with spotlights. In addition, two days before the official opening, the studio floor had to be completely reconstructed to assure a smooth pavement for the cameras to role on it efficiently.|$|E
50|$|The image {{iconoscope}} (Superikonoskop) became the industrial standard for public broadcasting in Europe from 1936 until 1960, {{when it was}} replaced by the vidicon and <b>plumbicon</b> tubes.
