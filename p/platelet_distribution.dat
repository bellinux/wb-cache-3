40|$|This study aimes to {{evaluate}} platelet and leucocyte indicators, {{such as the}} mean platelet volume, <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> width, plateletcrit, white blood cell count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio in nasopharyngeal cancer patients and also {{to evaluate}} {{the relationship between these}} indicators and nasopharyngeal cancer with distant metastasis. The medical records of 118 patients diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer in our hospital between January 2006 and August 2015 were reviewed. The nasopharyngeal cancer group was further sub grouped according to {{the presence or absence of}} distant metastasis and TNM (tumour – T, node – N, metastasis – M) classification. A control group consisted of 120 healthy patients. The platelet and leucocyte values at the time of the initial diagnosis were recorded. Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> width values were significantly higher in the nasopharyngeal cancer group. But only <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> width values were significantly higher in the nasopharyngeal cancer group with distant metastasis compared to the nasopharyngeal cancer group without distant metastasis. Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> width values may increase in nasopharyngeal cancer.

40|$|The {{results of}} the Coulter counter S plus II {{platelet}} volume analysis were studied in 100 patients with reactive thrombocytosis (platelet count greater than 500 X 10 (9) /l), in 30 patients with myeloproliferative thrombocytosis, and in 32 patients with chronic myeloproliferative disease and a platelet count less than 500 X 10 (9) /l. Patients with reactive thrombocytosis had considerably lower mean platelet volumes than those with myeloproliferative thrombocytosis, or normal subjects. The opposite was true for the <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> width. This index for platelet heterogeneity was normal in reactive, but increased in myeloproliferative thrombocytosis. There were no differences in mean platelet volume or <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> width between patients with myeloproliferative disease and a high or normal platelet count. The increased platelet heterogeneity in myeloproliferative disease was caused by an increase of both small and large platelets. The <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> width {{seemed to be the}} best variable for the differential diagnosis of thrombocytosis. A <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> width greater than 17 was found in 26 of the 30 patients with myeloproliferative thrombocytosis but in only five of the 100 patients with reactive thrombocytosis.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the use of}} platelet volume indices {{in the interpretation of}} thrombocytopenia in dogs with systemic disease. Methods: Case records of 80 control dogs and 159 thrombocytopenic dogs with systemic disease were reviewed retrospectively. The relationships between mean platelet volume, <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> width and platelet count in systemically well dogs were established. Knowledge of these relationships was used to interpret thrombocytopenia in terms of the underlying disease process. Results: There was a positive relationship between <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> width and mean platelet volume. Both <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> width and mean platelet volume varied in a negative relationship with platelet count, which was unaffected by signalment, underlying disease, variations in haematological parameters or serum proteins.

40|$|The {{combustion}} {{behavior of}} a blend made of high impact polystyrene (HIPS) with sodium montmorillonite (MMT-Na+) and triphenyl phosphite (TPP), as a halogen-free flame retardant, is analyzed in detail in this work. The blend is processed through various extrusion methods aimed to improve clay dispersion. The UL 94 method in vertical position, oxygen index and cone calorimetric measurements assess HIPS blend behavior in combustion. TGA, FTIR, SEM and X-ray measurements, together with mechanical and rheological tests evaluate the thermal degradation, morphology, intercalation and degree of dispersion of particles. The use of a static-mixing die placed at the extreme of a single screw extruder improves clay <b>platelets</b> <b>distribution</b> and reduces the peak heat release rate better than employing a twin screw extrusion process. In addition, mechanical and rheological properties are affected substantially by changing the extrusion process. A correlation between clay dispersion and HIPS fire retardant properties is found, as the peak heat release rate decreases with good clay dispersion in cone calorimetric tests...|$|R

Methods: The study group included 45 adult patients diagnosed with cutaneous leishmaniasis and treated as inpatients in the dermatology clinic between 2011 and 2014. A group of 45 healthy adults served as a control group. Results: Pre- and post-treatment white blood cell count, neutrophils, and lymphocytes were significantly reduced among the patient group relative to the control group. <b>Platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> width, red cell distribution width, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and platelet/lymphocyte ratio were significantly elevated among the patients compared to the healthy subjects. Pre-treatment white blood cell, lymphocyte and platelet counts were significantly elevated compared to post-treatment counts among the patient cohort. Treatment was associated with reduced eosinophil count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and platelet/lymphocyte ratio relative to pre-treatment status. Conclusion: Routine hematological testing results such as platelet/lymphocyte ratio, white blood cell count, neutrophil count, red cell distribution width, <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> width, and mean platelet volume may be clinically significant markers of the inflammatory state useful in the evaluation of early treatment efficacy among patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{understanding}} of non-genetic regulation of platelet indices [...] platelet count, plateletcrit, mean platelet volume, and <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> width [...] is limited. The association of these platelet indices {{with a number}} of biochemical, environmental and clinical variables was studied in a large cohort of the general population. DESIGN AND METHODS: Men and women (n= 18, 097, 52 % women, 56 ± 12 years) were randomly recruited from various villages in Molise (Italy) in the framework of the population-based cohort study "Moli-sani". Hemochromocytometric analyses were performed using an automatic analyzer (Beckman Coulter, IL, Milan, Italy). Associations of platelet indices with dependent variables were investigated by multivariable linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Full models including age, sex, body mass index, blood pressure, smoking, menopause, white and red blood cell counts, mean corpuscular volume, D-dimers, C-reactive protein, high-density lipoproteins, low-density lipoproteins, triglycerides, glucose, and drug use explained 16 %, 21 %, 1. 9 % and 4. 7 % of platelet count, plateletcrit, mean platelet volume and <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> width variability, respectively; variables that appeared to be most strongly associated were white blood cell count, age, and sex. Platelet count, mean platelet volume and plateletcrit were positively associated with white blood cell count, while <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> width was negatively associated with white blood cell count. Platelet count and plateletcrit were also positively associated with C-reactive protein and D-dimers (P< 0. 0001). Each of the other variables, although associated with platelet indices in a statistically significant manner, only explained less than 0. 5 % of their variability.

The routine clinical chemistry laboratory clas-sically provides only limited help in distinguishing between reactive thrombocytosis (RT) and autonomous thrombocytosis, where platelet production escapes nor-mal regulatory processes, and which is seen in myelo-proliferative diseases (MPD) such as essential thrombo-cythemia and polycythemia vera.

40|$|Abnormalities of {{platelet}} size {{are one of}} the {{distinguishing features}} of inherited throm-bocytopenias (ITs), and evaluation of blood films is recommended as an essential step for differential diagnosis of these disorders. Nevertheless, what we presently know about this subject is derived mainly from anecdotal evidence. To improve knowledge in this field, we evaluated platelet size on blood films obtained from 376 patients with all 19 forms of IT identified so far and found that these conditions differ not only in mean platelet diameter, but also in <b>platelet</b> diameter <b>distribution</b> width and the percentage of platelets with increased or reduced diameters. On the basis of these findings, we propose a new classification of ITs according to platelet size.

We also measured platelet diameters in 87 patients with immune thrombocytopenia and identified cut off values for mean platelet diameter and the percentage of platelets with increased or reduced size that have good diagnostic accuracy in differentiating ITs with giant platelets and with normal or slightly decreased platelet size from immune thrombocytopenia and all other forms of IT...|$|R
40|$|Megakaryocytes {{generate}} platelets by remodeling their cytoplasm {{into long}} proplatelet extensions, which serve as assembly lines for platelet production. Platelet packaging and release concludes at {{the tips of}} each proplatelet. Essential in this process is the distribution of organelles and platelet-specific granules into the nascent platelets. To investigate the mechanism of delivery of organelles into putative <b>platelets,</b> the <b>distribution</b> and dynamics of organelles/granules was monitored. Individual organelles are sent from the cell body to the proplatelets where they move bidirectionally until they are captured at proplatelet ends. Movement occurs at approximately 0. 2 μm/min, but pauses and changes in direction are frequent. At any given time, approximately 30 % of organelles/granules are in motion. Actin poisons do not diminish organelle motion, and vesicular structures are intimately associated with the microtubules. Therefore, movement appears to involve microtubule-based forces. Bidirectional organelle movement is conveyed by the bipolar organization of microtubules within the proplatelet, as kinesin-coated beads move bidirectionally on the microtubule arrays of permeabilized proplatelets. Movement of organelles along proplatelets involves 2 mechanisms: organelles travel along microtubules, and the linked microtubules move relative to each other. These studies demonstrate that the components that form platelets are delivered to and assembled de novo along proplatelets...|$|R

An F₂ intercross resource of 1126 animals was bred from these two parental strains for a genomewide scan for quantitative trait loci (QTL) for platelet count. QTL were identified on MMU 1 (LOD 6. 8, p < 0. 0005) and MMU 11 (LOD 11. 2, p < 0. 0005) by selectively genotyping animals from the extremes of the F₂ <b>platelet</b> count <b>distribution.</b> Three other QTL of suggestive statistical significance were also detected on MMU 7, 13, and 17.

40|$|AbstractBlood {{flows through}} vessels as a {{segregated}} suspension. Erythrocytes distribute {{closer to the}} vessel axis, whereas platelets accumulate near vessel walls. Directed platelet migration to the vessel walls promotes their hemostatic function. The mechanisms underlying this migration remain poorly understood, although various hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon (e. g., the available volume model and the drift-flux model). To study this issue, we constructed a mathematical model that predicts the <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> profile across the flow {{in the presence of}} erythrocytes. This model considers platelet and erythrocyte dimensions and assumes an even <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> between erythrocytes. The model predictions agree with available experimental data for near-wall layer margination using platelets and platelet-modeling particles and the lateral migration rate for these particles. Our analysis shows that the strong expulsion of the platelets from the core to the periphery of the blood vessel may mainly arise from the finite size of the platelets, which impedes their positioning in between the densely packed erythrocytes in the core. This result provides what we believe is a new insight into the rheological control of platelet hemostasis by erythrocytes...|$|E

There is not much data in literature about overlooked hemogram parameters (ie. red cell distribution width, mean platelet volume, <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> width) in vitamin B 12 deficiency. We aimed to compare pre and post treatment hematological parameters of patients with vitamin B 12 deficiency in present retrospective study. Methodology: Patients with vitamin B 12 deficiency icluded to the study. Age, gender, vitamin B 12 levels and hematological parameters, such as, {{white blood cell count}} (WBC), neutrophil count (neu), lymphocyte count (lym), eosinophil count (eos), hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Htc), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), red cell distribution width (RDW), platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV) and <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> width (PDW) were recorded. Results: Pretreatment RDW (16. 5 ± 0. 6) was significantly higher than in posttreatment (16. 1 ± 1) period (p= 0. 021).

RBC indices (mean cor-puscular volume [MCV], mean corpuscular hemoglobin [MCH], MCH concentration [MCHC], and RBC distri-bution width [RDW]) and platelet indices (plateletcrit [PCT], mean platelet volume [MPV], and <b>platelet</b> size <b>distribution</b> width [PDW]) were determined on a Cell-Dyn hematology analyzer. Hematological findings in-cluded neutrophilic leukocytosis or neutropenic leukopenia, lymphopenia, and monocytosis in BVDV-infected cattle. RBC, haemoglobin, and RDW were higher (P<. 001) in infected cattle, but MCV was lower (P<. 001), than those of controls. Platelet count, MPV, and PDW were higher in infected cattle, compared with controls (P<. 05). In conclusion, changes in RBC and platelet indices may reflect changes in RBC and platelet production and reactivity. These indices should be used routinely during the diagnostic workup for BVDV infection in cattle practice. Key Words: Bovine viral diarrhea virus, cattle, platelet indices, red blood cell indices.

40|$|In {{patients}} {{suffering from}} various platelet abnormalities, quantitative scanning after injection of indium- 111 (111 In) labelled platelets showed three different patterns of <b>platelet</b> destruction and <b>distribution.</b> In {{patients with a}} normal platelet life span but with evidence of increased splenic pooling, the spleen tended {{to be the main}} site of destruction. In patients with a moderately reduced platelet life span, the distribution of destruction in the system and variable destruction in the marrow. However, because of its rapidity this destruction was difficult to quantify, and it was difficult in these cases to distinguish reliably between spleen pool, sequestration, and destruction. Destruction of platelets on the liver appeared to be unimportant in all three groups. 111 In, because of its physical characteristics, is preferable to chromium- 51 as a platelet label in the assessment of abnormal platelet kinetics...|$|R
40|$|Light {{scattering}} patterns (LSP) {{of blood}} platelets were theoretically and experimentally analyzed. We used spicular spheroids {{as a model}} for the platelets with pseudopodia. The discrete dipole approximation was employed to simulate light scattering from an individual spicular spheroid constructed from a homogeneous oblate spheroid and 14 rectilinear parallelepipeds rising from the cell centre. These parallelepipeds have a weak effect on the LSP over the measured angular range. Therefore, a homogeneous oblate spheroid was taken as a simplified optical model for platelets. Using the T-matrix method, we computed the LSP over a range of volumes, aspect ratios and refractive indices. Measured LSPs of individual platelets were compared one by one with the theoretical set and the best fit was taken to characterize the measured <b>platelets,</b> resulting in <b>distributions</b> of volume, aspect ratio and refractive index.

40|$|Sudden {{sensorineural hearing}} loss (SSNHL) is a common {{otological}} disorder characterized by a hearing loss greater than 30 dB over three consecutive frequencies, in less than 72 hours. It has been established that platelet parameters, such as mean platelet volume, are associated with ischemic heart events, whose clinical manifestations {{are similar to those}} of SSNHL. Hence, we aimed to determine if the platelet count, mean platelet volume and <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> width are related to the occurrence and severity of sudden {{sensorineural hearing loss}}. A case-control prospective study was conducted in a teaching hospital in Iran. One hundred-eight patients with SSNHL and an equal number of healthy, age- and sex-matched controls were enrolled in the study. Peripheral venous blood samples were collected from the subjects, and the platelet count, mean platelet volume and <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> width were measured with an automated blood cell counter. Analysis of the audiometry and hematological test results using SPSS 22 software showed no statistical correlation between the platelet parameters and the occurrence of SSNHL, but correlation coefficients showed a significant correlation between PDW and hearing loss severity in patients group. However, further investigation is required to unequivocally establish the absence of correlation between the platelet parameters and occurrence of SSNHL...|$|E

The present {{experiment}} {{evaluates the}} influence of apitherapy diet on CCl 4 experimentally induced liver disease in Wistar rats, by the means of number of thrombocytes, mean platelet volume and <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> width. Protection was achieved by the administration of apitherapy products for three weeks. Hepatic lesion was induced by intraperitoneal injection of CCl 4 (dissolved in paraffin oil, 10 % solution). The experiment was unfolded on 60 Wistar rats, divided into 6 groups: control group standard food (group I), control group apitherapy diet (group II), control group apitherapy diet + royal jelly (grou...|$|E
40|$|AIMS [...] To {{assess whether}} r-HuEPO (recombinant human erythropoietin) has {{any effect on}} thrombopoiesis in {{patients}} with chronic renal failure. METHODS [...] This was a retrospective study of 78 patients with chronic renal failure undergoing either haemodialysis (n = 57) or intraperitoneal dialysis (n = 21). All patients had a full blood count (in EDTA) measured before starting r-HuEPO and at monthly intervals thereafter up to six months. Variables studied were haematocrit, platelet count, mean platelet volume (MPV) and <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> width (PDW). Other groups of control patients were also studied [...] patients with chronic renal failure receiving dialysis but not r-HuEPO (n = 40) {{and a group of}} patients with normal renal function who were receiving aspirin (n = 30). RESULTS [...] There was a significant increase in mean haematocrit (p < 0. 01) and in mean platelet volume (p < 0. 001) over the six month period, but no change in either total platelet count or <b>platelet</b> <b>distribution</b> width in the patients with chronic renal failure receiving r-HuEPO. In contrast, both the control groups showed no significant change in MPV. CONCLUSIONS [...] The results suggest that r-HuEPO affects thrombopoiesis and may be {{part of a group of}} humoral factors contributing to megakaryocyte development and maturation. Larger platelets are more reactive and may contribute to the increased risk of thrombosis associated with r-HuEPO...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{platelet}} closure time (CT), mean platelet component (MPC) concentration, and <b>platelet</b> component <b>distribution</b> width (PCDW) in {{dogs with}} subclinical chronic valvular heart disease. ANIMALS: 89 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCSs) and 39 control dogs (not CKCSs). PROCEDURES: Platelet count, MPC concentration, PCDW, and Hct were measured {{by use of}} a hematology analyzer, and CT was measured by use of a platelet function analyzer. Murmur grade and echocardiographic variables (mitral valve regurgitant jet size relative to left atrial area, left atrial-to-aortic diameter ratio, and left ventricular internal dimensions) were recorded. Associations between explanatory variables (sex, age, murmur grade, echocardiographic variables, platelet count, and Hct) and outcomes (CT, MPC concentration, and PCDW) were examined by use of multivariate regression models. RESULTS: A model with 5 variables best explained variation in CT (R(2), 0. 74), with > 60 % of the variance of CT explained by mitral valve regurgitant jet size. The model of best fit to explain variation in MPC concentration included only platelet count (R(2), 0. 24). The model of best fit to explain variation in PCDW included platelet count and sex (R(2), 0. 25). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In this study, a significant effect of mitral valve regurgitant jet size on CT was consistent with platelet dysfunction. However, platelet activation, as assessed {{on the basis of}} the MPC concentration and PCDW, was not a feature of subclinical chronic valvular heart disease in CKCSs...|$|R
40|$|Accurate and {{detailed}} {{models of the}} seismic velocity structure of gas hydrate-bearing sediments may be determined by careful analysis of controlled source seismic data. However, interpretation of these velocities in terms of hydrate saturation of the pore space has hitherto relied on semiempirical formulas and/or simple effective medium theory. We develop a rigorous theoretical scheme to relate the seismic properties of a clay-rich hydrate-bearing sediment to its porosity, mineralogy, microstructural features and hydrate saturation. We consider separately the two possible end-members for the distribution of hydrate in the pore space: (1) hydrates are unconnected and located in the pore voids without appreciable grain contact and (2) connected hydrates are forming cement binding around the grains. The scheme is transversely isotropic, to allow for anisotropy due to alignment of clay platelets, {{and is based on}} a combination of a self-consistent approximation, a differential effective medium theory, and a method of smoothing for crystalline aggregates. We have applied the scheme to lithological and seismic velocity data from Ocean Drilling Program Site 995 on the Blake Ridge (southeastern U. S. continental margin) to make estimates of the hydrate saturation. It was found that the hydrates are probably unconnected, and their volume concentration varies between approx. 0 % at 100 m below the seabed and approx. 9 % at 400 m depth, just above the “bottom simulating reflector”, if the clay <b>platelet</b> orientation <b>distribution</b> resembles the function we have used...|$|R
40|$|Several tetraspanins bind {{directly}} to a few molecular partners to form primary complexes, which might assemble through tetraspanin-tetraspanin interactions to form a network of molecular interactions, the tetraspanin web. We have produced a monoclonal antibody directed to a 63 kDa molecule (determined under non-reducing conditions) associated with CD 9. This molecule was first identified by MS as a molecule with four Ig domains, EWI- 2. Like the related molecule CD 9 P- 1, EWI- 2 {{was found to be}} a partner not only for CD 9, but also for CD 81, a tetraspanin required for hepatic infection by the parasite responsible for malaria, and also a putative hepatitis C virus receptor. Using chimaeric CD 9 /CD 82 molecules, two separate regions of CD 9 of 40 and 47 amino acids were demonstrated to confer the ability to interact with EWI- 2. Both EWI- 2 and CD 9 P- 1 were detected in the human liver at the surface of hepatocytes and were found to associate with CD 81 on freshly isolated hepatocytes. EWI- 2 also co-localized with CD 81 in the liver. CD 9 P- 1 was not detected on most peripheral blood cells, whereas EWI- 2 was expressed on the majority of B-, T- and natural killer cells and was not detected on monocytes, polynuclear cells or <b>platelets.</b> This <b>distribution</b> is identical to that of CD 81. Finally, EWI- 2 associated with all tetraspanins studied after lysis under conditions preserving tetraspanin-tetraspanin interactions, showing that EWI- 2 is a new component of the tetraspanin web...|$|R
