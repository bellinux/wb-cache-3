50|$|The {{adhesive}} {{is largely}} {{affected by the}} temperature as polymeric adhesives are commonly used today. Polymeric materials used today are viscoelastic materials, which enables easy application and quick adherence to the substrate. Adhesive degradation in the bulk {{is largely due to}} temperature effects, which reduce adhesion causing delamination of the adhesive tape. Too low a temperature can cause the <b>polymeric</b> <b>adhesive</b> to enter its glass state becoming very brittle and reducing adhesion. Raising the temperature, on the other hand, causes the polymer to become more fluid and mobile. As the mobility increases, the polymer adhesion is reduced as the polymer starts to flow as opposed to adhere. Both temperature extremes ultimately results in delamination. The ideal temperature range is largely dependent on the adhesive identity, which comes down to polymer structure. The more rigid the polymer chain is, the stronger the Intermolecular Forces between polymer chains, and the stronger the interactions between the substrate and the adhesive will ultimately result in a strong adhesion and, as a result, a higher ideal temperature range for adhesion.|$|E

40|$|Steel sheets bonded with a {{thin layer}} of a <b>polymeric</b> <b>adhesive</b> are used for their sound-deadening effect in {{applications}} such as machine enclosures and automobile bulk-heads. Unlike sandwich materials designed primarily for high rigidity, they are formed by conventional methods and the effect of the relative inability of the adhesive to transmit shear on formability of the sheet and conformity to the tool profile is important. The adhesive in sheet steel/adhesive/steel laminate used for acoustic damping displays viscoelasticity only at small strain, and strain hardening is associated with subsequent viscous flow. High forming speed is favourable to the forming of steel sheet laminate bonded with a viscoplastic <b>polymeric</b> <b>adhesive</b> because it increases the ability of the adhesive to transmit shear forces, which in turn increases the transverse stiffness of sheet laminates, although it increases springback (decreases the shape fixability of the laminate).

40|$|There {{are many}} {{advantages}} that <b>polymeric</b> <b>adhesives</b> can offer {{compared to the}} more traditional methods of joining such as bolting, brazing, welding, mechanical fasteners, etc. and epoxy adhesives represent {{the most common type}} of structural adhesive. When polymerised, epoxy adhesives are amorphous and highly-crosslinked materials and this microstructure results in many useful properties for structural engineering applications, such as a high modulus and failure strength, low creep, and, by careful formulation, good performance at elevated temperatures. However, the structure of such thermosetting adhesives also generally leads to one highly undesirable property in that they are relatively brittle materials, with a poor resistance to crack initiation and growth. Nevertheless, the incorporation of a second phase of dispersed rubbery particles into the epoxy polymer can greatly increase their toughness without significantly impairing the other desirable engineering properties. Thus, such rubber-toughened epoxy adhesives can be used, for example, in applications where a very high impact resistance is required for the adhesively-bonded joint...|$|R

30|$|Joining {{together}} two surfaces using a <b>polymeric</b> <b>adhesive,</b> such as cyanoacrylate, has been commonplace for decades, but the resulting bonds still suffer from major performance issues [1]. For example, bonds made with low surface energy polyolefin-based materials, such as high-density polyethylene (HDPE), suffer from insufficient bond strength {{with a large}} standard deviation [2, 3]. In many engineering applications, like in some medical devices, adhesive bonding is the only method that is acceptable due to {{the high cost of}} alternative methods and additional constraints like dissimilarity of the materials to be bonded [4, 5]. Often, the combination of adhesives that bond {{to a wide range of}} materials, like cyanoacrylate, and low surface energy polymeric materials, like HDPE, are necessitated by the constraints of the design. Unfortunately, the bonds formed between cyanoacrylate and HDPE are mechanically weak with large sample to sample strength variation, causing the performance of the end product to suffer drastically [2, 3]. The low bond strength between these materials derives from the absence of polar groups on the polymer surface and the weak chemical interaction between the polymer and adhesive [6, 7].|$|E

To this end, a combined experimental and numerical investigation of interfacial crack growth is carried out using a modified compact tension shear specimen involving two aluminium plates bonded by a thin ductile adhesive layer. A cohesive zone model along with a simple traction versus separation law is employed in the finite element simulations of crack growth. It is observed that $J_{ss}$ increases strongly as mode II loading is approached. Also, it enhances with bondline thickness in the above limit. These trends are rationalized by examining the plastic zones obtained from the numerical simulations.
