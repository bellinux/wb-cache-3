60|$|Pollen from a long-styled flower {{was placed}} on all five stigmas of a long-styled flower on a {{separate}} plant: after nineteen hours the stigmas were dissected, and only a single pollen-grain had emitted a tube, {{and this was a}} very short one. To make sure that the pollen was good, I took in this case, and in most of the other cases, pollen either from the same anther or from the same flower, and proved it to be good by placing it on the stigma of a short-styled plant, and found numerous <b>pollen-tubes</b> emitted.|$|R
60|$|As I {{only twice}} experimented {{on more than}} a single species in a genus, I cannot say whether the crossed {{offspring}} of the several species within the same genus differ in their degree of superiority over their self-fertilised brethren; but I should expect that this would often prove to be the case from what was observed with the two species of Lobelia and with the individuals of the same species of Nicotiana. The species belonging to distinct genera in the same family certainly differ in this respect. The effects of cross- and self-fertilisation may be confined either to the growth or to the fertility of the offspring, but generally extends to both qualities. There does not seem to exist any close correspondence between the degree to which their offspring profit by this process; but we may easily err on this head, as there are two means for ensuring cross-fertilisation which are not externally perceptible, namely, self-sterility and the prepotent fertilising influence of pollen from another individual. Lastly, it has been shown in a former chapter that the effect produced by cross and self-fertilisation on the fertility of the parent-plants does not always correspond with that produced on the height, vigour, and fertility of their offspring. The same remark applies to crossed and self-fertilised seedlings when these are used as the parent-plants. This want of correspondence probably depends, at least in part, on the number of seeds produced being chiefly determined by the number of the <b>pollen-tubes</b> which reach the ovules, and this will be governed by the reaction between the pollen and the stigmatic secretion or tissues; whereas the growth and constitutional vigour of the offspring will be chiefly determined, not only by the number of <b>pollen-tubes</b> reaching the ovules, but {{by the nature of the}} reaction between the contents of the pollen-grains and ovules.|$|R
60|$|In certain whole {{groups of}} plants the ovules stand erect, and in others they are suspended; {{and within the}} same ovarium of some few plants, one ovule holds the former and a second ovule the latter position. These {{positions}} seem at first purely morphological, or of no physiological signification; but Dr. Hooker informs me that within the same ovarium the upper ovules alone in some cases, and in others the lower ones alone are fertilised; and he suggests that this probably depends on {{the direction in which}} the <b>pollen-tubes</b> enter the ovarium. If so, the position of the ovules, even when one is erect and the other suspended within the same ovarium, would follow the selection of any slight deviations in position which favoured their fertilisation, and the production of seed.|$|R

This demonstrates how a specific point in the reproductive process is manipulated by a particular isolating mechanism to prevent hybrids.|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe {{majority}} of <b>pollen-tube</b> growth in Arabidopsis occurs in specialized tissue called the transmitting tract. Little is currently known {{about how the}} transmitting tract functions {{because of a lack}} of mutants affecting its development. We have identified such a mutant and we used it to investigate aspects of <b>pollen-tube</b> growth. ResultsReverse genetics was used to identify mutations in a gene, NO TRANSMITTING TRACT (NTT), encoding a C 2 H 2 /C 2 HC zinc finger transcription factor specifically expressed in the transmitting tract. The ntt mutants have a negative effect on transmitting-tract development. Stage-specific analysis of transmitting-tract development was carried out and was correlated with investigations of <b>pollen-tube</b> behavior. In ntt mutants, pollen tubes grow more slowly and/or terminate prematurely, and lateral divergence is accentuated over apical-to-basal movement. Normal transmitting-tract development is shown to involve a process of programmed cell death (PCD) that is facilitated by, but does not depend upon, pollination. ConclusionsThis is the first report of a gene that is specifically required for transmitting-tract development in Arabidopsis. Mutations in NTT cause reduced fertility by severely inhibiting <b>pollen-tube</b> movement. The data support the idea that the function of the transmitting tract is to increase fertilization efficiency, particularly in the lower half of the ovary. This occurs by facilitating <b>pollen-tube</b> growth through differentiation and then death of transmitting-tract cells...|$|E
60|$|The grains being then removed, and {{examined}} under the microscope, were found discoloured, with the oil-globules remarkably aggregated. Many had their contents much shrunk, {{and some were}} almost empty. In only a few cases were the <b>pollen-tubes</b> emitted. There could {{be no doubt that}} the secretion had penetrated the outer coats of the grains, and had partially digested their contents. So it must be with the gastric juice of the insects which feed on pollen, without masticating it.* Drosera in a state of nature cannot fail to profit to a certain extent by this power of digesting pollen, as innumerable grains from the carices, grasses, rumices, fir-trees, and other wind-fertilised plants, which commonly grow in the same neighbourhood, will be inevitably caught by the viscid secretion surrounding the many glands.|$|R
60|$|Pollen from a short-styled {{plant was}} placed on the five stigmas of a long-styled flower, and these, after thirty hours, were found deeply {{penetrated}} by a multitude of <b>pollen-tubes,</b> far too numerous to be counted; the stigmas had also become discoloured and twisted. I repeated this experiment on another flower, and in eighteen hours the stigmas were penetrated by a multitude of long pollen- tubes. This is what might have been expected, as the union is a legitimate one. The converse experiment was likewise tried, and pollen from a long-styled flower {{was placed on}} the stigmas of a short-styled flower, and in twenty-four hours the stigmas were discoloured, twisted, and penetrated by numerous pollen-tubes; and this, again, is what might have been expected, as the union was a legitimate one.|$|R
6000|$|Self-sterility differs much {{in degree}} in {{different}} plants. In those extraordinary {{cases in which}} pollen from the same flower acts on the stigma like a poison, it is almost certain that the plants would never yield a single self-fertilised seed. Other plants, like Corydalis cava, occasionally, though very rarely, produce a few self-fertilised seeds. A large number of species, as {{may be seen in}} Table 9/F, are less fertile with their own pollen than with that from another plant; and lastly, some species are perfectly self-fertile. Even with the individuals of the same species, as just remarked, some are utterly self-sterile, others moderately so, and some perfectly self-fertile. The cause, whatever it may be, which renders many plants more or less sterile with their own pollen, that is, when they are self-fertilised, must be different, at least to a certain extent, from that which determines the difference in height, vigour, and fertility of the seedlings raised from self-fertilised and crossed seeds; for we have already seen that the two classes of cases do not by any means run parallel. This want of parallelism would be intelligible, if it could be shown that self-sterility depended solely on the incapacity of the <b>pollen-tubes</b> to penetrate the stigma of the same flower deeply enough to reach the ovules; whilst the greater or less vigorous growth of the seedlings no doubt depends {{on the nature of the}} contents of the pollen-grains and ovules. Now it is certain that with some plants the stigmatic secretion does not properly excite the pollen-grains, so that the tubes are not properly developed, if the pollen is taken from the same flower. This is the case according to Fritz Muller with Eschscholtzia, for he found that the <b>pollen-tubes</b> did not penetrate the stigma deeply; and with the Orchidaceous genus Notylia they failed altogether to penetrate it.

40|$|The {{expansion}} of both root hairs and pollen tubes occurs {{by a process}} known as tip growth. In this report, an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant (tip 1) is described that displays defects in both root-hair and <b>pollen-tube</b> growth. The root hairs of the tip 1 mutant plants are shorter than those of the wild-type plants and branched at their base. The tip 1 <b>pollen-tube</b> growth defect was identified by the aberrant segregation ratio of phenotypically normal to mutant seeds in siliques from self-pollinated, heterozygous plants. Homozygous mutant seeds are not randomly distributed in the siliques, comprising only 14. 4 % of the total seeds, 5. 3 % of the seeds from the bottom half, and 2. 2 % of the seeds from the bottom quarter of the heterozygous siliques. Studies of <b>pollen-tube</b> growth in vivo showed that mutant pollen tubes grow more slowly than wild-type pollen through the transmitting tissue of wild-type flowers. Cosegregation studies indicate that the root-hair and <b>pollen-tube</b> defects are caused by the same genetic lesion. Based on these findings, the TIP 1 gene is likely to encode a product involved in a fundamental aspect of tip growth in plant cells...|$|E

40|$|In eukaryotes, {{fertilization}} {{relies on}} complex and specialized mechanisms that achieve the precise {{delivery of the}} male gamete to the female gamete and their subsequent union [1 - 4]. In flowering plants, the haploid male gametophyte or pollen tube (PT) [5] carries two nonmotile sperm cells to the female gametophyte (FG) or embryo sac [6] during a long assisted journey through the maternal tissues [7 - 10]. In Arabidopsis, typically one PT reaches {{one of the two}} synergids of the FG (Figure 1 A), where it terminates its growth and delivers the sperm cells, a poorly understood process called <b>pollen-tube</b> reception. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of the Arabidopsis mutant abstinence by mutual consent (amc). Interestingly, <b>pollen-tube</b> reception is impaired only when an amc pollen tube reaches an amc female gametophyte, resulting in <b>pollen-tube</b> overgrowth and completely preventing sperm discharge and the development of homozygous mutants. Moreover, we show that AMC is strongly and transiently expressed in both male and female gametophytes during fertilization and that AMC functions in gametophytes as a peroxin essential for protein import into peroxisomes. These findings show that peroxisomes play an unexpected key role in gametophyte recognition and implicate a diffusible signal emanating from either gametophyte that is required for <b>pollen-tube</b> discharge...|$|E

60|$|It is remarkable, {{considering}} that the flowers secrete much nectar and afford much pollen, how seldom they are visited by insects either in England, or, as H. Muller remarks, in North Germany. I have observed the flowers for the last thirty years, and in all this time have only thrice seen bees of the proper kind at work (one of them being Bombus muscorum), such as were sufficiently powerful to depress the keel, so as to get the undersides of their bodies dusted with pollen. These bees visited several flowers, and could hardly have failed to cross-fertilise them. Hive-bees and other small kinds sometimes collect pollen from old and already fertilised flowers, but this is of no account. The rarity of the visits of efficient bees to this exotic plant is, I believe, the chief cause of the varieties so seldom intercrossing. That a cross does occasionally take place, {{as might be expected}} from what has just been stated, is certain, from the recorded cases of the direct action of the pollen of one variety on the seed-coats of another. (5/14. 'Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication' chapter 11 2nd edition volume 1 page 428.) The late Mr. Masters, who particularly attended to the raising of new varieties of peas, was convinced that some of them had originated from accidental crosses. But as such crosses are rare, the old varieties would not often be thus deteriorated, more especially as plants departing from the proper type are generally rejected by those who collect seed for sale. There is another cause which probably tends to render cross-fertilisation rare, namely, the early age at which the <b>pollen-tubes</b> are exserted; eight flowers not fully expanded were examined, and in seven of these the <b>pollen-tubes</b> were in this state; but they had not as yet penetrated the stigma. Although so few insects visit the flowers of the pea in this country or in North Germany, and although the anthers seem here to open abnormally soon, it does not follow that the species in its native country would be thus circumstanced.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} studied phenotypic {{and genetic}} variations in eight floral morphological traits {{that affect the}} mating systems of Collinsia heterophylla, effects of pollination treatments on flower longevity and <b>pollen-tube</b> growth rate. The aim was to assess how phenotypic and genetic variations in floral traits, {{as well as other}} interacting mechanisms, influence mating systems in plants. This study found that, floral traits varied continuously within - and between - populations, and across floral developmental stages in Norway and Chiltern populations. Floral traits showed high correlations and heritabilities, with corolla, stamen and pistil recording the highest correlations in the two populations. Thereby, suggesting genetic linkages or pleiotropy effects among traits. Consequently, traits either evolve together or the selection of one trait constrains the other. Thus, the termination of pistil life through pollination and fertilisation could impact on structure and functions of the corolla, pistil and the stamens. The study also found that, the effects of pollination treatments, time of pollen arrival and pollination significantly affect flower longevity. Furthermore, autonomous selfing occurred early in Norway population, but late in Chiltern population. Inter-population cross pollination treatment showed shortest flower longevity in Norway population than Chiltern, indicating differential <b>pollen-tube</b> growth rate. <b>Pollen-tube</b> growth rate was assessed in-vitro and in-vivo and results showed no correlation in <b>pollen-tube</b> growth rate invitro and in-vivo. However, Chiltern population had longer <b>pollen-tube</b> growth in-vivo than Norway population. Similarly, Chiltern population grew longer pollen-tubes on the Norway style than on the Chiltern and vice versa in Norway pollen-tubes; suggesting partial cryptic selfincompatibility (CSI) in C. heterophylla. Therefore, floral traits variations, correlations, heritabilities, flower longevity and post-pollination processes can drive the course of mating systems evolution in flowering plants.

40|$|An {{important}} aspect of the evolution of carpel closure, or angiospermy, is the relationship between pollen tube growth patterns and internalization of the <b>pollen-tube</b> pathway. True carpel closure, involving postgenital fusion of inner carpel margins, is inferred to have arisen once within the ancient order Nymphaeales, in the common ancestor of Nymphaeaceae. We studied pollen tube development, from pollination to fertilization, in a natural population of Nymphaea odorata, using hand pollinations and timed flower collections. Pollen germinates in stigmatic secretions within 15 min and pollen tubes enter subdermal transmitting tissue within an hour, following wide intercellular spaces towards the zone of postgenital fusion. At the zone of fusion they turn downwards to grow in narrow spaces between interlocked cells and then wander freely to ovules within ovarian secretions. The <b>pollen-tube</b> pathway is 2 – 6 mm long and upper ovules are first penetrated 2. 5 h after pollination. Pollen tubes grow at rates of approximately 1 mm/h whether in stigmatic fluid, transmitting tissues or ovarian secretions. <b>Pollen-tube</b> pathways are structurally diverse across Nymphaeales, yet their pollen tubes have similar morphologies and rapid growth rates. This pattern suggests pollen tube growth innovations preceded and were essential for the evolutio...|$|E
40|$|In alders, where {{fertilization}} occurs ≈ 8 {{weeks after}} pollination, the pollen tube (male gametophyte) grows intermittently in four steps in close {{association with the}} development of the ovary and its ovules. Pollen tubes stop growing in the style, at the ovarian locule, and at the chalaza (ovule), before reaching an embryo sac for fertilization. At the stage when the ovary develops an ovule primordium in each of the two locules, many pollen tubes germinate on the stigma, and a few of them reach the style, where they remain for ≈ 7 weeks. Thereafter, a single tube resumes growing; with a short stop in the upper space of the ovarian locule, it reaches the older of the two ovules when it has developed a two-nucleate embryo sac. Except in the last step, where the tube grows from the chalaza to an embryo sac (female gametophyte), an eight-nucleate mature embryo sac is not necessary for <b>pollen-tube</b> guidance in the pistil.

60|$|Causes of the Sterility {{of first}} Crosses and of Hybrids.--We may now {{look a little}} closer at the {{probable}} causes of the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids. These two cases are fundamentally different, for, as just remarked, in the union of two pure species {{the male and female}} sexual elements are perfect, whereas in hybrids they are imperfect. Even in first crosses, the greater or lesser difficulty in effecting a union apparently depends on several distinct causes. There must sometimes be a physical impossibility in the male element reaching the ovule, as would be the case with a plant {264} having a pistil too long for the <b>pollen-tubes</b> to reach the ovarium. It has also been observed that when pollen of one species is placed on the stigma of a distantly allied species, though the <b>pollen-tubes</b> protrude, they do not penetrate the stigmatic surface. Again, the male element may reach the female element, but be incapable of causing an embryo to be developed, as seems to have been the case with some of Thuret's experiments on Fuci. No explanation can be given of these facts, any more than why certain trees cannot be grafted on others. Lastly, an embryo may be developed, and then perish at an early period. This latter alternative has not been sufficiently attended to; but I believe, from observations communicated to me by Mr. Hewitt, who has had great experience in hybridising gallinaceous birds, that the early death of the embryo is a very frequent cause of sterility in first crosses. I was at first very unwilling to believe in this view; as hybrids, when once born, are generally healthy and long-lived, as we see {{in the case of the}} common mule. Hybrids, however, are differently circumstanced before and after birth: when born and living in a country where their two parents can live, they are generally placed under suitable conditions of life. But a hybrid partakes of only half of the nature and constitution of its mother, and therefore before birth, as long as it is nourished within its mother's womb or within the egg or seed produced by the mother, it may be exposed to conditions in some degree unsuitable, and consequently be liable to perish at an early period; more especially as all very young beings seem eminently sensitive to injurious or unnatural conditions of life.|$|R

40|$|Evolutionary {{change in}} {{response}} to natural selection will occur only if a trait confers a selective advantage and there is heritable variation. Positive connections between pollen traits and fitness have been found, but few studies of heritability have been conducted, and they have yielded conflicting results. To understand better the evolutionary significance of pollen competition and its potential role in sexual selection, the heritability of pollen tube-growth rate {{and the relationship between}} this trait and sporophytic offspring fitness were investigated in Collinsia heterophylla. Because the question being asked was if female function benefited from obtaining genetically superior fathers by enhancing pollen competition, one-donor (per flower) crosses were used in order to exclude confounding effects of post-fertilization competition/allocation caused by multiple paternity. Each recipient plant was crossed with an average of five pollen donors. <b>Pollen-tube</b> growth rate and sporophytic traits were measured in both generations. <b>Pollen-tube</b> growth rate in vitro differed among donors, and the differences were correlated with in vivo growth rate averaged over two to four maternal plants. <b>Pollen-tube</b> growth rate showed significant narrow-sense heritability and evolvability in a father-offspring regression. However, this pollen trait did not correlate significantly with sporophytic-offspring fitness. These results suggest that <b>pollen-tube</b> growth rate can respond to selection via male function. The data presented here do not provide any support for the hypothesis that intense pollen competition enhances maternal plant fitness through increased paternity by higher-quality sporophytic fathers, although this advantage cannot be ruled out. These data are, however, consistent with the hypothesis that pollen competition is itself selectively advantageous, through both male and female function, by reducing the genetic load among successful gametophytic fathers (pollen), and reducing inbreeding depression associated with self-pollination in plants with mix-mating systems...|$|E
40|$|Aims {{of study}} were to compare flower structure, pollen {{viability}} and pollen tube {{growth rate of}} two Diospyros species neighborly live in Cibinong Science Centre (CSC) park, Diospyros blancoi and D. celebica, and pursue if <b>pollen-tube</b> growth rate shire reasons endemic distribution of D. celebica in native habitat. Floral structurewas in situ or ex situ morphologically observed. Germination test and pollen tube growth incubation were done in Sarfatti medium and digitally captured and computerize analysis. The result showed that, both species have flower part resemblance each other. D. blancoi has bigger size in almost all flower parts. D. blancoi showed much more pollen viability (41 % vs 7 %) and tube growth rate than D. celebica 1 (66 vs 0. 57 μm per minute). Average <b>pollen-tube</b> length of both species at about 31 / 2 hours incubation was significantly different each other (342. 679 ± 37. 067 vs 128, 673 ± 49, 215 μm). Most observed D. blancoi female trees set high number of fruit year to year and almost observed D. celebica female trees set very low number of fruit and some time without fruit in the year. It is associated with geographical distribution {{difference between the two}} species. Very significantlydifferent in pollen-germination percentage and <b>pollen-tube</b> growth rate provide a tool of further study to know microenvironment for reproduction and propagation of the endemic species, D. celebica...|$|E
60|$|The five stamens of the cleistogamic {{flowers are}} provided, {{as in the}} last case, with small anthers, from all of which <b>pollen-tubes</b> proceed to the stigma. The petals are not quite so much reduced as in V. canina, and the short pistil instead of being hooked is merely bent into a rectangle. Of several perfect flowers which I saw visited by hive-and humble-bees, six were marked, but they {{produced}} only two capsules, {{some of the others}} having been accidentally injured. M. Monnier was therefore mistaken in this case as in that of V. odorata, in supposing that the perfect flowers always withered away and aborted. He states that the peduncles of the cleistogamic flowers curve downwards and bury the ovaries beneath the soil. (8/8. These statements are taken from Professor Oliver's excellent article in the 'Natural History Review' July 1862 page 238. With respect to the supposed sterility of the perfect flowers in this genus see also Timbal-Lagrave 'Botanische Zeitung' 1854 page 772.) I may here add that Fritz Muller, as I hear from his brother, has found in the highlands of Southern Brazil a white-flowered species of violet which bears subterranean cleistogamic flowers.|$|R
60|$|We thus {{see that}} fifty-five flowers on {{five of the}} above plants were {{reciprocally}} crossed in various ways; several flowers {{on each of these}} plants being fertilised with pollen from several of the other plants. These fifty-five flowers produced fifty-two capsules, almost all of which were of full size and contained an abundance of seeds. On the other hand, seventy-nine flowers (besides many others not recorded) were fertilised with pollen from other flowers on the same plants, and these did not produce a single capsule. In one case in which I examined the stigmas of the flowers fertilised with their own pollen, these were penetrated by the <b>pollen-tubes,</b> although such penetration produced no effect. Pollen falls generally, and I believe always, from the anthers on the stigmas of the same flower; yet only three out of the above seven protected plants produced spontaneously any capsules, and these it might have been thought must have been self-fertilised. There were altogether seven such capsules; but as they were all seated close to the artificially crossed flowers, I can hardly doubt that a few grains of foreign pollen had accidentally fallen on their stigmas. Besides the above seven plants, four others were kept covered under the SAME large net; and some of these produced here and there in the most capricious manner little groups of capsules; and this makes me believe that a bee, many of which settled {{on the outside of the}} net, being attracted by the odour, had on some one occasion found an entrance, and had intercrossed a few of the flowers.|$|R
60|$|Delpino {{states that}} this plant {{presents}} in Italy three forms, which graduate from an anemophilous into an entomophilous condition. According to H. Muller, {{there are only}} two forms in Germany, neither of which show any special adaptation for insect fertilisation, and both appear to be hermaphrodites. (7/19. 'Die Befruchtung' etc. page 342.) But I have found in two localities in England female and hermaphrodite forms existing together; and the same fact has been noticed by others. (7/20. Mr. C.W. Crocker 'The Gardener's Chronicle' 1864 page 294. Mr. W. Marshall writes to me to the same effect from Ely.) The females are less frequent than the hermaphrodites; their stamens are short, and their anthers, which are of a brighter green whilst young than those of the other form, dehisce properly, yet contain either no pollen, or a small amount of imperfect grains of variable size. All the flower-heads on a plant belong to the same form. It is well known that this species is strongly proterogynous, and I found that the protruding stigmas of both the hermaphrodite and female flowers were penetrated by <b>pollen-tubes,</b> whilst their own anthers were immature and had not escaped out of the bud. Plantago media does not present two forms; but it appears from Asa Gray's description, that such is the case with four of the North American species. (7/21. 'Manual of the Botany of the Northern United States' 2nd edition 1856 page 269. See also 'American Journal of Science' November 1862 page 419 and 'Proceedings of the American Academy of Science' October 14, 1862 page 53.) The corolla does not properly expand in the short- stamened form of these plants.|$|R
