5|$|A batting all rounder, Loxton {{played as}} a {{right-handed}} middle-order batsman and a right-arm fast medium bowler who reinforced the frontline pace attack of Ray Lindwall, Keith Miller and Bill Johnston. Starting the tour as a fringe player, Loxton was omitted for the <b>pre-Test</b> fixtures against Worcestershire and the Marylebone Cricket Club, where Australia traditionally fielded their full-strength team. He was overlooked {{for the first}} two Tests; reserve opening batsman Bill Brown played out of position in the middle-order. However, Brown struggled in the unfamiliar role, and Loxton scored 159 not out against Gloucestershire to oust the former from his position for the Third Test at Old Trafford. Loxton scored 36 to help Australia avoid the follow on and salvage a draw, before making his most notable contribution in the Fourth Test at Headingley. He took 3/55 in the first innings and scored a counter-attacking 93 on the third day to keep Australia in the game; they went on to win after a world record-breaking run-chase on the final day. Loxton also played in the Fifth Test and ended the series with 144 runs at a batting average of 48.00 and three wickets at a bowling average of 49.33.|$|E
5|$|Loxton then {{played in}} each of Australia’s four {{remaining}} tour games before the Tests, {{but was unable to}} do enough to force his way into the first-choice team. He made 39 and 52 against Lancashire, and 16 against Nottinghamshire, squandering his starts in the latter two innings to run outs. In the match against Hampshire, he made one in his only innings after Australia were caught on a damp pitch and took a solitary wicket. The Australian team's batting depth did not help Loxton’s cause; in the final <b>pre-Test</b> match against Sussex, a match won by an innings and 325 runs, he was slated to bat at No. 9, but Australia’s earlier batsmen were largely untroubled so Bradman declared at 5/549. The all-rounder’s 3/13 in the first innings had the effect of removing him from the bowling line-up {{for the rest of the}} match, as Doug Ring, Ernie Toshack, Ron Hamence and Ian Johnson helped Ray Lindwall to bowl the touring team to an easy victory. Loxton had limited opportunities as those ahead of him tended to finish off the opposition before his turn, and did not score heavily enough when he had a chance, so he was overlooked for the First Test at Trent Bridge. Bradman again opted to use Brown out of position in the middle-order as Australia took an eight-wicket win.|$|E

40|$|Loss of {{function}} of the guanine nucleotide binding protein RhoA blocks <b>pre-T</b> cell differentiation and survival indicating that this GTPase is a critical signaling molecule during early thymocyte development. Previous work {{has shown that the}} Rho family GTPase Rac- 1 can initiate changes in actin dynamics necessary and sufficient for <b>pre-T</b> cell development. The present data now show that Rac- 1 actions in <b>pre-T</b> cells require Rho function but that RhoA cannot substitute for Rac- 1 and induce the actin cytoskeletal changes necessary for <b>pre-T</b> cell development. Activation of Rho is thus not sufficient to induce <b>pre-T</b> cell differentiation or survival {{in the absence of the}} <b>pre-T</b> cell receptor (TCR). The failure of RhoA activation to impact on pre-TCR–mediated signaling was in marked contrast to its actions on T cell responses mediated by the mature TCR �/ � complex. Cells expressing active RhoA were thus hyperresponsive in the context of TCR-induced proliferation in vitro and in vivo showed augmented positive selection of thymocytes expressing defined TCR complexes.

40|$|We have {{recently}} described {{a bone marrow}} culture system which is able to maintain {{a portion of the}} precursor-T (<b>pre-T)</b> cell compartment of adult murine marrow in vitro, in the presence of interleukin- 3 (IL- 3), for at least 2 weeks. However, because growth in IL- 3 might also induce the differentiation of the <b>pre-T</b> cells, it is necessary {{to determine the extent to}} which the developmental potential of the <b>pre-T</b> cells is altered during their residency in vitro. Previously, we analysed the progeny of cultured <b>pre-T</b> cells and compared their intrathymic development, their appearance in the periphery, and their V beta gene utilization to that of the progeny of fresh <b>pre-T</b> cells. Within these parameters, the cells derived from cultured marrow cells did not differ significantly from cells derived from fresh marrow cells.

40|$|During {{thymocyte}} development, {{progression from}} T cell receptor (TCR) � to TCR � rearrangement is mediated by a CD 3 -associated pre-TCR {{composed of the}} TCR � chain paired with pre-TCR � (pT�). A major issue is how surface expression of the pre-TCR is regulated during normal thymocyte development to control transition through this checkpoint. Here, we show that developmental expression of pT � is time- and stage-specific, and is confined in vivo to a limited subset of large cycling human <b>pre-T</b> cells that coexpress low density CD 3. This restricted expression pattern allowed the identification of a novel subset of small CD 3 � thymocytes lacking surface pT�, but expressing cytoplasmic TCR�, that represent late noncycling <b>pre-T</b> cells in which recombination activating gene reexpression and downregulation of T early � transcription are coincident events associated with cell cycle arrest, and immediately preceding TCR � gene expression.

Previous work has shown that the guanine nucleotide binding protein Rho controls cell survival in T cell progenitors. Here we define the survival pathways controlled by Rho in <b>pre-T</b> cells and show that this GTPase is a pivotal regulator of the p 53 -mediated checkpoint operating at the time of � selection: loss of Rho function results in apoptosis in <b>pre-T</b> cells, but this cell death is prevented by loss of p 53. The prevention of cell death by loss of p 53 restored numbers of early T cell progenitors but did not fully restore thymic cellularity. Further analysis revealed that loss of Rho function caused survival defects in CD 4 / 8 double-positive thymocytes that is independent of p 53 but can be prevented by ectopic expression of Bcl- 2. These studies highlight that the GTPase Rho is a crucial component of survival signaling pathways in at least two different thymocyte subpopulations: Rho controls the p 53 survival checkpoint in <b>pre-T</b> cells and is also crucial for a p 53 independent survival signaling pathway in CD 4 / 8 double positives.

We reconstituted fetal lobes with sorted <b>pre-T,</b> or post <b>pre-T</b> CD 4 −CD 8 − precursor cells. The addition of either IL- 7 or hGM-CSF to these cultures suppressed further differentiation of <b>pre-T</b> cells but not post <b>pre-T</b> cells. At the same time, the cell number was increased, suggesting that pre-T-cell proliferation is stimulated by these cytokines. Furthermore, the differentiation of recombination-activating gene- 1 (RAG- 1) -deficient <b>pre-T</b> cells in response to anti-CD 3 antibody stimulation was suppressed by either IL- 7 or hGM-CSF, suggesting that these cytokines inhibit the pre-T-cell receptor (pre-TCR) signal.

Recent analysis of the downstream events of IL- 7 receptor and GM-CSF receptor revealed that they share common signal transduction molecules.

40|$|The pre-T-cell antigen {{receptor}} (pre-TCR), expressed by immature thymocytes, has {{a pivotal role}} in early T-cell development, including TCR beta-selection, survival and proliferation of CD 4 (-) CD 8 (-) double-negative thymocytes, and subsequent ab T-cell lineage differentiation(1 - 3). Whereas alpha beta TCR ligation by the peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex initiates T-cell signalling(4), preTCR-induced signalling occurs by means of a ligand-independent dimerization event(5). The pre-TCR comprises an invariant a-chain (<b>pre-T</b> alpha) that pairs with any TCR beta-chain (TCR beta) following successful TCR beta-gene rearrangement(6). Here we provide the basis of <b>pre-T</b> alpha-TCR beta assembly and pre-TCR dimerization. The <b>pre-T</b> alpha chain comprised a single immunoglobulin-like domain that is structurally distinct from the constant (C) domain of the TCR alpha-chain(7); nevertheless, the mode of association between <b>pre-T</b> alpha and TCRb mirrored that mediated by the C alpha-C beta domains of the abTCR. The pre-TCR had a propensity to dimerize in solution, and the molecular envelope of the pre-TCR dimer correlated well with the observed head-to-tail pre-TCR dimer. This mode of pre-TCR dimerization enabled the <b>pre-T</b> alpha domain to interact with the variable (V) beta domain through residues that are highly conserved across the V beta and joining (J) beta gene families, thus mimicking the interactions {{at the core of the}} alpha beta TCR 2 ̆ 7 s V alpha-V beta interface. Disruption of this <b>pre-T</b> alpha-V beta dimer interface abrogated pre-TCR dimerization in solution and impaired pre-TCR expression on the cell surface.

40|$|AbstractBackground: The {{development}} of immature thymocytes is {{regulated by the}} pre-T-cell receptor (pre-TCR). The pre-TCR is involved in several developmental processes including rescuing cells from programmed cell death, allelic exclusion and αβ versus γδ T-cell lineage commitment. A major issue is how the pre-TCR functions to integrate these processes in developing thymocytes. Results: We have used a sensitive immunofluorescence technique to reveal the surface-expression profile of the pre-TCR on immature thymocyte subsets. We show that early <b>pre-T</b> cells (CD 25 +CD 44 −) can be subdivided {{on the basis of}} the level of surface pre-TCR expression. Detectable surface pre-TCR expression identified a rapidly cycling population of early <b>pre-T</b> cells which had successfully undergone β-selection and been rescued from programmed cell death. Late <b>pre-T</b> cells (CD 25 −CD 44 −), which had traversed the β-selection checkpoint, expressed surprisingly heterogeneous surface levels of the pre-TCR: high levels of surface pre-TCR expression were associated with commitment to the αβ T-cell lineage, whereas late <b>pre-T</b> cells with lower levels of surface pre-TCR could develop along both the αβ or γδ T-cell lineages. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that the surface expression of the pre-TCR can be used to reveal newly identified stages of T-cell development and to provide insights into αβ T-cell lineage commitment. They show that, although pre-TCR expression does not act as a developmental switch per se, its level of surface expression on late <b>pre-T</b> cells predicts their developmental potential...|$|R
40|$|Enforced {{expression}} of Id 3, {{which has the}} capacity to inhibit many basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, in human CD 34 (+) hematopoietic progenitor cells that have not undergone T cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements inhibits development of the transduced cells into TCRalpha beta and gamma delta cells in a fetal thymic organ culture (FTOC). Here we document that over{{expression of}} Id 3, in progenitors that have initiated TCR gene rearrangements (<b>pre-T</b> cells), inhibits development into TCRalpha beta but not into TCRgamma delta T cells. Furthermore, Id 3 impedes expression of recombination activating genes and downregulates pre-Talpha mRNA. These observations suggest possible mechanisms by which Id 3 overexpression can differentially affect development of <b>pre-T</b> cells into TCRalpha beta and gamma delta cells. We also observed that cell surface CD 4 (-) CD 8 (-) CD 3 (-) cells with rearranged TCR genes developed from Id 3 -transduced but not from control-transduced <b>pre-T</b> cells in an FTOC. These cells had properties of both natural killer (NK) and <b>pre-T</b> cells. These findings suggest that bHLH factors are required to control T cell development after the T/NK developmental checkpoin...|$|R
