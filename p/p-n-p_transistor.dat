50|$|Bipolar {{transistors}} are {{so named}} because they conduct by using both majority and minority carriers. The bipolar junction transistor, the first type of transistor to be mass-produced, {{is a combination of}} two junction diodes, and is formed of either a thin layer of p-type semiconductor sandwiched between two n-type semiconductors (an n-p-n transistor), or a thin layer of n-type semiconductor sandwiched between two p-type semiconductors (a <b>p-n-p</b> <b>transistor).</b> This construction produces two p-n junctions: a base-emitter junction and a base-collector junction, separated by a thin region of semiconductor known as the base region (two junction diodes wired together without sharing an intervening semiconducting region will not make a transistor).|$|E
50|$|Because the {{electron}} mobility {{is higher than}} the hole mobility for all semiconductor materials, a given bipolar n-p-n transistor tends to be swifter than an equivalent <b>p-n-p</b> <b>transistor.</b> GaAs has the highest electron mobility of the three semiconductors. It {{is for this reason that}} GaAs is used in high-frequency applications. A relatively recent FET development, the high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT), has a heterostructure (junction between different semiconductor materials) of aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs)-gallium arsenide (GaAs) which has twice {{the electron}} mobility of a GaAs-metal barrier junction. Because of their high speed and low noise, HEMTs are used in satellite receivers working at frequencies around 12 GHz. HEMTs based on gallium nitride and aluminium gallium nitride (AlGaN/GaN HEMTs) provide a still higher electron mobility and are being developed for various applications.|$|E

Moore, Hoerni and Last led three teams working on three alternative technologies. The technology of Moore resulted in a higher yield of operational n-p-n transistors, and in July–September 1958, they went into mass production. The release of <b>p-n-p</b> <b>transistors</b> of Hoerni was delayed until early 1959. This created the Moore-Hoerni conflict at Fairchild: Moore ignored the contribution of Hoerni, and Hoerni believed that his work was unfairly treated.

The do operational {{limits of the}} proposed detector are analysed by means of numerical device simulations, pointing out that, by properly distancing {{the base of the}} <b>p-n-p</b> <b>transistor</b> from the emitter of the n-p-n detector, the latch-up of the parasitic thyristor embedded within the detector-plus-biasing-transistor structure takes place at relatively high current levels, where detector operation should anyway be avoided in order to prevent the associated current-gain loss. Numerical simulations provides insight about the bias dependence of charge-collection waveforms, indicating that minimization of the collecting time requires the detector quiescent current to be adjusted at the highest value still allowing high-injection effects to be avoided. A small-signal equivalent circuit of the proposed structure is also derived, allowing the impact of p-n-p biasing transistor and load resistance on the charge-collecting time constant to be evaluated. First experimental results show that fabricated structures are immune from the latch-up of the parasitic thyristor throughout their high-current-gain operating region and feature a minimum charge-collecting time constant of 35 mu s, as tested by pulsed laser illumination...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 In view {{of recent}} {{developments}} in large-scale, complex digital systems, it is of interest to broaden the study of two-leveled logical systems {{to the study of}} three-leveled systems. This paper introduces the ternary logic system and develops a design approach for ternary digital systems that is based on familiar binary techniques. Ternary number systems are introduced and two base-conversion algorithms are given: one for integral numbers and the other for fractional numbers. Ternary arithmetic is similar to binary arithmetic or to decimal arithmetic. Four algebraic operations, Cycling, Negation, And, and Or, are then defined and the algebra is systematically developed through postulates and theorems. The algebraic method of minimization is difficult for a large number of variables or terms, and the map method is impracticable for more than three variables. Hence a programmable minimization method is developed by analogy with the Quine-McCluskey method for binary minimization. Diode-transistor schemes of circuit realization are presented. In these, the idea is to use <b>p-n-p</b> and n-p-n <b>transistor</b> pairs to provide the three different voltage levels desired. Tristable devices using three Cycling-gates are also described.
