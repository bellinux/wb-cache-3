40|$|In retail stores, {{consumers}} are frequently offered choices between {{large and small}} packages of products. Previous literature characterizes choices between large and small packages primarily {{as a means for}} manufacturers to practice price discrimination.

In this paper, we examine consumers’ willingness to pay more for the <b>services</b> provided by <b>packaging,</b> {{and the degree to which}} this changes their susceptibility to price discrimination. We conduct a series of studies in which consumers make choices among alternatives with different package characteristics, brands, and prices, holding constant the purchase quantity. We find evidence that {{consumers are}} willing to pay for <b>packaging</b> <b>services,</b> and that their willingness to pay for these services varies across product categories. Our results suggest that in product categories for which freshness is a concern, <b>packaging</b> <b>services</b> may be underutilized as positioning attributes.
