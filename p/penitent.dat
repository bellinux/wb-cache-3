5|$|In {{response}} to the petition, the council set up a commission that proposed a city synod. For this gathering, Bucer provided a draft document of sixteen articles on church doctrine. The synod convened on 3 June 1533 at the Church of the <b>Penitent</b> Magdalens to debate Bucer's text, eventually accepting it in full. Sectarian leaders were brought before the synod and questioned by Bucer. Ziegler was dismissed and allowed to stay in Strasbourg; Hoffmann was imprisoned as {{a danger to the}} state; and Schwenckfeld left Strasbourg of his own accord.|$|E
5|$|In {{the poem}} Gawain, when the Knight is beheaded, he tells Gawain {{to meet him}} at the Green Chapel, saying that all nearby know where it is. Indeed, the guide which is to bring Gawain there from Bertilak's castle grows very fearful as they near it and begs Gawain to turn back. The final meeting at the Green Chapel has caused many {{scholars}} to draw religious connections, with the Knight fulfilling a priestly role with Gawain as a <b>penitent.</b> The Green Knight ultimately, in this interpretation, judges Gawain to be a worthy knight, and lets him live, playing a priest, God, and judge all at once.|$|E
5|$|The Naradiya Purana narrates that Uttanka {{lived in}} an ashram in Ujjalaka. In his old age, he left for a pilgrimage and {{travelled}} to various temples. Once, the sage saw a hunter named Gulika stealing the golden plates of the temple of Vishnu at Sauvira. Gulika tried to kill the sage. Then Uttanka informed Gulika that the sin of murder would be to live through many births to expiate his sin. Hearing this the hunter was <b>penitent</b> and fell dead. Uttanka then sprinkled water from the holy Ganges on the hunter's corpse, which restored Gulika who then attained Vaikuntha, the abode of Vishnu. As advised by Vishnu, Uttanka went to Badari, performed tapas and attained Vaikuntha himself.|$|E

Noah Webster's Dictionary, 1828, under [...] "penitent" [...] affirmed [...] "Order of <b>penitents,</b> {{a religious}} order established by one Bernard of Marseilles, {{about the year}} 1272, for the reception of reformed courtezans.

5|$|Among Mahler's fellow {{students}} at the Conservatory was the future song composer Hugo Wolf, with whom he formed a close friendship. Wolf was unable {{to submit to the}} strict disciplines of the Conservatory and was expelled. Mahler, while sometimes rebellious, avoided the same fate only by writing a <b>penitent</b> letter to Hellmesberger. He attended occasional lectures by Anton Bruckner and, though never formally his pupil, was influenced by him. On 16 December 1877, he attended the disastrous premiere of Bruckner's Third Symphony, at which the composer was shouted down, and most of the audience walked out. Mahler and other sympathetic students later prepared a piano version of the symphony, which they presented to Bruckner. Along with many music students of his generation, Mahler fell under the spell of Richard Wagner, though his chief interest was the sound of the music rather than the staging. It is not known whether he saw any of Wagner's operas during his student years.|$|E
5|$|During {{the events}} of Halo 2, the Covenant and humans {{discover}} a second ringworld, Installation 05, or Delta Halo. It was monitored by 2401 <b>Penitent</b> Tangent, who completely ignored Flood warnings and was captured by their leader, the Gravemind. The Covenant leadership wants to activate the installation, believing it {{is the key to}} their salvation. At the same time, the Flood, led by an intelligence known as the Gravemind, lay siege to the Covenant's city-ship, High Charity. After 343 Guilty Spark informs Halo's true purpose to the Arbiter, a Covenant holy warrior, of the danger that the Halos truly represent, a group of humans and Covenant Elites prevent the firing of the ring. The unexpected shutdown activates a fail-safe protocol, priming the remaining Halo installations for remote activation from a location known as The Ark.|$|E
5|$|Luther {{also had}} {{experience}} with the indulgences connected to All Saints' Church, Wittenberg. By venerating the large collection of relics at the church, one could receive an indulgence. He had preached as early as 1514 against the abuse of indulgences {{and the way they}} cheapened grace rather than requiring true repentance. Luther became especially concerned in 1517 when his parishioners, returning from purchasing Tetzel's indulgences, claimed that they no longer needed to repent and change their lives in order to be forgiven of sin. After hearing what Tetzel had said about indulgences in his sermons, Luther began to study the issue more carefully, and contacted experts on the subject. He preached about indulgences several times in 1517, explaining that true repentance was better than purchasing an indulgence. He taught that receiving an indulgence presupposed that the <b>penitent</b> had confessed and repented, otherwise it was worthless. A truly repentant sinner would also not seek an indulgence, because they loved God's righteousness and desired the inward punishment of their sin. These sermons seem to have ceased from April to October 1517, presumably while Luther was writing the Ninety-five Theses. He composed a Treatise on Indulgences, apparently in early autumn 1517. It is a cautious and searching examination of the subject. He contacted church leaders on the subject by letter, including his superior , Bishop of Brandenburg, sometime on or before 31 October, when he sent the Theses to Archbishop Albert of Brandenburg.|$|E

50|$|At al-Qarqisiya, the Qaysi {{refugees}} from the Battle of Marj Rahit aided the <b>Penitents</b> with supplies and advice but refused to join them, seeing no hope in their endeavour. The <b>Penitents</b> pressed on to 'Ayn al-Warda (identified with Ras al-'Ayn), where they encountered an Umayyad army of 20,000 under Husayn ibn Numayr al-Sakuni. The battle lasted for three days; although the <b>Penitents</b> held {{the upper hand in}} the first skirmish, in the following two days the numerical superiority of the Umayyad army began to prevail. Finally, Sulayman ibn Surad was killed and the <b>Penitents</b> were surrounded and almost annihilated. Rifa ibn Shaddad advised the survivors to return and brought them to al-Qarqisiya after their defeat. The small number of <b>Penitents</b> who survived the battle of 'Ayn al-Warda went over to the pro-Alid leader al-Mukhtar al-Thaqafi. These Kufans, who formed the backbone of al-Mukhtar's movement, called themselves Shi'at al-Mahdi (Partisans of the Mahdi), Shi'at al-Haqq (Partisans of Righteousness) or Shi'at al-Muhammad (Partisans of Muhammad).|$|R

25|$|The <b>penitent</b> is {{the subject}} rather than the object of this discourse. Contrition is not {{something}} that happens to the <b>penitent</b> but is rather an affect he or she creates, as the focus on humility and on the weeping voice suggests. Affectivity is the translation of idea into expressive gesture, and this moment is surely an affective one. If the genuineness of a late-medieval spiritual experience is confirmed by its external signs—by its affectivity, in other words—we should extend the same criterion to the early evidence, where we find that it works just as well.|$|E

Orthodox understand that the confession is not made to the priest, but to Christ, and the priest stands only as witness and guide. Before confessing, the <b>penitent</b> venerates the Gospel Book and cross, and places the thumb and first two fingers of his right hand on the feet of Christ as he is depicted on the cross. The confessor will often read an admonition warning the <b>penitent</b> to make a full confession, holding nothing back.|$|E

25|$|Since Baptism {{can only}} be {{received}} once, the sacrament of Penance and Reconciliation is the principal means by which Catholics may obtain forgiveness for subsequent sin and receive God's grace and assistance not to sin again. This is based on Jesus' words to his disciples in the Gospel of John 20:21–23. A <b>penitent</b> confesses his sins to a priest who may then offer advice or impose a particular penance to be performed. The <b>penitent</b> then prays an act of contrition and the priest administers absolution, formally forgiving the person of his sins. A priest is forbidden under penalty of excommunication to reveal any matter heard under the seal of the confessional. Penance helps prepare Catholics before they can validly receive the Holy Spirit in the sacraments of Confirmation (Chrismation) and the Eucharist.|$|E
