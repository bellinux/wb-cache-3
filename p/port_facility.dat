5|$|Despite {{their best}} efforts to control Viet Cong {{activities}} across the river in the Thu Thiem area, the South Vietnamese military and police could not stop Viet Cong agents from operating there. So Viet Cong members of the 65th Special Operations Group were able to watch U.S. and South Vietnamese military activities at the port, while they were preparing to attack American targets. Lam Son Nao, a commando of the 65th Special Operations Group, was also an employee at the <b>port</b> <b>facility.</b> As his unit was assigned with the mission to attack the American escort carrier, Nao took advantage of his position as an employee at the <b>port</b> <b>facility,</b> to reconnoitre Card to design the best strategy to sabotage the ship and all the military hardware on board. Nao’s father had previously worked at the <b>port</b> <b>facility</b> as a tradesman, so he memorised all the underground tunnels and sewerage systems which ran {{in and out of}} the facility. He advised Nao that the best way to enter the area where the American ships normally anchored, was via the sewer tunnel opposite Thu Thiem.|$|E

In mid 2015 Drax reached an agreement with Peel Ports to construct a 3million ton per year biomass importation facility at the Port of Liverpool, estimated cost £100 million. The rail connected facility was to include 100,000 tonnes storage, and be constructed by Graham Construction.|$|E
5|$|In Trondheim, the {{existing}} railway station for the Trondhjem–Støren Line was {{built as a}} cul-de-sac station at Kalvskinnet. This could not serve the Meråker Line and the station was thus moved to Brattøra, an artificial peninsula immediately {{north of the city}} center. Thus the station became located next to the new <b>port</b> <b>facility.</b> With the construction of the Røros Line, it was decided to connect both lines to the same station. The cost of the new station was 1.4 million kroner. Trondheim Station did not open until 1882.|$|E
40|$|Upgrading {{engineering}} of inland simple backward <b>port</b> <b>facilities</b> is {{urgent and}} of great {{significance in the}} aspect of economy and society. <b>Port</b> <b>facilities</b> adaptability evaluation is the foundation work {{of the research on}} upgrading strategy. Based on Anhui inland simple back war d <b>port</b> <b>facilities</b> upgrading strategy research, AHP is introduced in the analysis of <b>port</b> <b>facilities</b> adaptability evaluation indicator system. The weights of 40 evaluation indicators are obtained through establishing an AHP structure model, constructing judgment matrixes, checking consistency, and calculating combination weights. By combining the analysis of relevant relationships between the indicators, 16 indicators are selected as in dicators of <b>port</b> <b>facilities</b> adaptability evaluation system. The research results lay the foundation for the upgrading strategy research on Anhui inland simple backward <b>port</b> <b>facilities,</b> which can be an essential reference for similar projects...|$|R

5|$|The {{amount of}} {{trackage}} for cargo was increased, {{with a wide}} section of land mass being filled into the sea to create a larger rail and <b>port</b> <b>facility</b> at Brattøra, though the filling of {{a large part of}} the seabed to create artificial land. The railways allowed the transshipment of cargo from ships from Northern Norway to rail, as well as from rail from Central Sweden to ships to the British Isles. The port was supplemented by a new line to Ilsvika would allow the loading of ore there. The suggestion to build double track to Leangen was dropped.|$|E
5|$|Under an Act of Parliament of 1874, the South Yorkshire {{company was}} {{absorbed into the}} Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. Despite the railway competition, traffic levels {{remained}} healthy, with the waterways carrying a total of 982,000 tons in 1878, {{but there was a}} growing dissatisfaction with the situation, particularly the high tolls compared to the railways, and the refusal to allow steam haulage, which had been in use on the neighbouring Aire and Calder Navigation for over 50 years. In an attempt to improve the situation, the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Canal Company Ltd was formed in 1888, with the intention of buying back the canals from the railway company, and upgrading them to offer effective competition to the railways. As a result of their efforts, the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Co was created by an Act of Parliament dated 26 August 1889, with powers to raise £1.5 million to purchase and improve four canals. These were the Sheffield Canal, the River Don Navigation, the Dearne and Dove Canal and the Stainforth and Keadby Canal. The intention was to upgrade the Don and the Stainforth and Keadby to take 300 or 400 ton barges, to investigate the use of compartment boats, and to build a new <b>port</b> <b>facility</b> at Keadby, where coal could be trans-shipped to seagoing vessels. Negotiations with the railway company were long and bitter, and the Navigation company only managed to raise £625,000 of the £1.14 million purchase price, with the result that although ownership of the waterways was transferred to them, the railway company still nominated five of the ten directors, and thus retained significant control.|$|E

25|$|After {{the country}} became {{independent}} of the United Kingdom on 30 November 1966 sugar cane still remained a chief money-maker for Barbados. The island's politicians tried to diversify the economy from just agriculture. During the 1950s–1960s visitors from both Canada and the United Kingdom started transforming tourism into a huge contributor for the Barbadian economy. The man-made Deep Water Harbour port at Bridgetown had been completed in 1961, and thereafter the island could handle most modern oceangoing ships for shipping sugar or handling cargoes at the <b>port</b> <b>facility.</b>|$|E

A handful of cruise ships call Swettenham Pier as their homeport as well, bringing tourists into and out of George Town towards regional destinations like Phuket and Singapore.|$|E

50|$|The Compagnie de Pulpe de Chicoutimi {{built the}} first <b>port</b> <b>facilities</b> on the Ha! Ha! Bay {{in the early twentieth}} century. Port-Alfred's mill and deep-water port made {{shipping}} pulp overseas much easier than Chicoutimi's <b>port</b> <b>facilities,</b> which were limited by the Saguenay River's shallow northern arm. The Port-Alfred Quay was opened in 1915. In 1924, the Compagnie de Pulpe de Chicoutimi's bankruptcy forced the company to sell its transportation infrastructure including the Port-Alfred <b>port</b> <b>facilities</b> to Alcan. The port was redeveloped to be able to receive bauxite and other materials needed for aluminum production and for shipping the Port-Alfred Pulp and Paper Corporation's newsprint. Duncan Quay was completed in 1938 and Powell Quay in 1948. Since 1976, icebreakers have kept Port-Alfred's <b>port</b> <b>facilities</b> accessible year-round. In 2000, Alcan entrusted the management of Powell Quay to the Saguenay Port Authority.|$|R

25|$|In 1973, {{the area}} around the old railway station was {{developed}} into a container <b>port</b> <b>facility,</b> with P & O operating a container service to Larne in Northern Ireland. In 1975, this became a Roll-on/roll-off service. This development led indirectly to some renewal of the then largely derelict Dock Street area, and improved road access to the town to support the container traffic. Twice-daily container service continued until 2004 when Stena Line bought the route and increased the service to three times a day. In December 2010, Stena Line announced that the service would be withdrawn at the end of 2010, with the loss of 140 jobs.|$|E
25|$|Once German commanders {{assessed}} the Allied assault at Normandy {{as the primary}} invasion, they sought to limit the lodgment while they prepared a counter-offensive. To preserve naval assets, the Cherbourg-based German E-boats were transferred to Saint-Malo. Four destroyers from Brest made for Cherbourg to follow the E-boats, but they were sunk or disabled. By June 14, the Germans were attempting to deny the Allies use of Cherbourg's major <b>port</b> <b>facility</b> by blocking, mining and demolishing its harbor. The violent English Channel storm that thrashed apart the artificial port Mulberry A raged until June 22. Logistic movement ashore was temporarily crippled, and the Allies desperately needed Cherbourg's port in their possession.|$|E

Today the port is located further downstream on the Shannon alongside the Dock Road and is operated by the Shannon Foynes Port Company (SFPC) who operate all marine activities in the Shannon estuary. It is a general purpose facility port. Plans to close the port and relocate all activity to the deepwater facility further downstream at Foynes have been abandoned. The plans included a major regeneration of the dockland area. Foynes is the main deepwater commercial port. SFPC is the second largest <b>port</b> <b>facility</b> in Ireland, handling over 10 million tonnes of cargo annually through the six terminals currently operational.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1974, Bush Terminal {{was still}} an active <b>port</b> <b>facility,</b> with vessels that docked between its piers. In 1974, the City of New York Department of Ports and Terminals hired a private company to fill the spaces between Piers 1 through 4 to make space for parking {{shipping}} containers. Filling, however, was halted in 1978 after reports of environmental violations. New York City officials later learned that toxic wastes including oils, oil sludges, and wastewaters had been dumped at the site, making the four piers a polluted brownfield. In 2006, Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Governor George Pataki announced a $36 million plan to clean up and redevelop the Bush Terminal piers. The plan included a $17.8 million grant {{from the state of}} New York, the largest single grant the state had ever awarded to clean up a brownfield site.|$|E
25|$|Indian Army Eastern Command {{had ordered}} Bangladesh Navy gunboats BNS Palash and BNS Padma, {{accompanied}} by INS Panvel {{and under the}} overall command of Commander M. N. Samant, to sail to the port at Chalna. These ships, carrying Bengali seamen and Indian command crews, had been operating against Pakistani shipping since November, and under the advice of Indian Eastern Air command, had painted their superstructure yellow to avoid misidentification. This had been reported back to Eastern Air Command. This task force sailed on 6 December, entered Mangla at 7:30 AM on 10 December, and took over the <b>port</b> <b>facility.</b> Commander Samant knew that Khulna was an IAF target, but decided to push on anyway. Around 11:30 AM, when the 3 ships were closing in on Khulna dockyard, 3 airplanes dived on them. Commander Samant recognized the IAF planes and ordered the ships to hold fire, but all 3 ships were strafed and sunk by the planes. 3 Bengali naval commandos and 7 Bengali sailors were killed, while 6 naval commandos, 1 BSF JCO, 3 Indian officers, and 7 Bengali seamen were injured. The Indian Navy gave 14 awards (including 3 Mahavir Chakras and 6 Vir Chakras) to the Indian rank-and-file involved in this incident. Bengali Seaman Ruhul Amin, who tried to save M. V. Palash despite being wounded and ordered to abandon ship, and who had later had died under torture, was awarded the Bir Shershtra by the Bangladeshi government. 21 Indian and Bengali sailors also became POWs.|$|E
