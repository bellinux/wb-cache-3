40|$|Nonmethane {{hydrocarbon}} {{breakdown in}} the atmosphere produces aldehydes of which a fraction are transferred into <b>peroxyacetyl</b> <b>nitrates</b> (PAN) {{in the presence of}} NO and NO 2. Since ethane is destroyed photochemically primarily above 1 km, PAN can be introduced into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere without the need to be transported from the boundary layer where most hydrocarbons are destroyed and where PAN may be lost due to thermal decomposition and heterogeneous loss. Mixing ratios of ethane in the lower troposphere increase by a factor of 4 - 8 from equatorial to northern mid-latitudes. This difference is directly translatable into a PAN latitude gradient. At mid-latitudes the concentration of PAN below 20 km is 0. 1 ppb comparable to and in some instances larger than predicted HO 2 NO 2 mixing ratios.

40|$|A {{commercial}} PTR-TOF-MS {{has been}} optimized {{in order to}} allow the measurement of individual organic nitrates in the atmosphere. This has been accomplished by shifting the distribution between different ionizing analytes, H 3 O + ∕ H 3 O + (H 2 O) n or NO + ∕ NO 2 +. The proposed approach has been proven to be appropriate for the online detection of individual alkyl nitrates and functionalized nitrates. It has been shown that hydroxyl and ketonitrates have a high affinity towards NO +, leading to the formation of an adduct that allows the easy identification of the organic nitrate (R) from the R–NO + ion signal. The recorded sensitivities for both ionization modes correspond to detection limits of tens of ppt min − 1 in the case of hydroxy- and ketonitrates. Alkyl nitrates exhibit a moderate affinity towards NO + ionization leading to detection units of few hundreds of ppt and the highest sensitivity in H 3 O + mode was obtained for the water adducts signals.

40|$|We {{interpret}} {{observations from}} the Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment, Phase B (INTEX-B) in spring 2006 using a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) to evaluate sensitivities {{of the free}} troposphere above the North Pacific Ocean and North America to Asian anthropogenic emissions. We develop a method to use satellite observations of tropospheric NO 2 columns to provide timely estimates of trends in NOx emissions. NOx emissions increased by 33 % for China and 29 % for East Asia from 2003 to 2006. We examine measurements from three aircraft platforms from the INTEX-B campaign, including a Canadian Cessna taking vertical profiles of ozone near Whistler Peak. The contribution to the mean simulated ozone profiles over Whistler below 5. 5 km is at least 7. 2 ppbv for Asian anthropogenic emissions and at least 3. 5 ppbv for global lightning NOx emissions. Tropospheric ozone columns from OMI exhibit a broad Asian outflow plume across the Pacific, which is reproduced by simulation. Mean modelled sensitivities of Pacific (30 &deg; N– 60 &deg; N) tropospheric ozone columns are at least 4. 6 DU for Asian anthropogenic emissions and at least 3. 3 DU for lightning, as determined by simulations excluding either source. Enhancements of ozone over Canada from Asian anthropogenic emissions reflect a combination of trans-Pacific transport of ozone produced over Asia, and ozone produced in the eastern Pacific through decomposition of <b>peroxyacetyl</b> <b>nitrates</b> (PANs). A sensitivity study decoupling PANs globally from the model's chemical mechanism establishes that PANs increase ozone production by removing NOx from regions of low ozone production efficiency (OPE) and injecting it into regions with higher OPE, resulting in a global increase in ozone production by 2 % in spring 2006. PANs contribute up to 4 ppbv to surface springtime ozone concentrations in western Canada. Ozone production due to PAN transport is greatest in the eastern Pacific; commonly occurring transport patterns advect this ozone northeastward into Canada.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2003 <b>Peroxyacetyl</b> <b>nitrate</b> (PAN) is an {{important}} atmospheric species due to its role in global transport of reactive nitrogen oxides, NOx (= ·NO₂ + ·NO). <b>Peroxyacetyl</b> <b>nitrate</b> is formed by reactions involving hydrocarbons and ·NO₂ in polluted regions and can be transported into the Arctic. To understand the role of PAN as a transporter of NOx to the Arctic, we need to quantify its decomposition pathways which include: thermal decomposition, photolysis, and reaction with the hydroxyl radical (·OH). In colder regions, such as the Arctic, the most rapid decomposition pathway is photolysis. Several photolytic pathways are possible for PAN. We photolyzed PAN in the laboratory using a frequency-doubled tunable dye laser. A highly sensitive technique called cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) probed the ·NO₃ produced in the photolysis reaction and we quantified the quantum yield for production of ·NO₃. The quantum yield is the fraction of photoexcited molecules that decompose to a certain chemical product. We determined that the quantum yield of ·NO₃ at 289 nm is 0. 30 [plus/minus] 0. 08. These results are discussed in context of previous work on PAN photolysis {{and in terms of}} a mechanistic model...|$|E

In the present study, the adsorption of nitrogen oxides on ice was investigated at atmospheric pressure using a chromatographic technique with low concentrations of radioactively labelled nitrogen oxides. The measured retentions solely depended on molecular adsorption and were not influenced by dimerisation, formation of encapsulated hydrates on the ice surface, dissociation of the acids, nor by migration into a quasi-liquid layer or grain boundaries. Based on the chromatographic retention and the model of thermochromatography, the adsorption enthalpies of − 20 kJ mol− 1 for NO, − 22 kJ mol− 1 for NO 2, − 30 kJ mol− 1 for <b>peroxyacetyl</b> <b>nitrate,</b> − 32 kJ mol− 1 for HONO and − 44 kJ mol− 1 for HNO 3 were calculated. To assess the adsorption enthalpies, standard adsorption entropies were calculated based on statistical thermodynamics. In this work, the use of two different standard states was demonstrated.
