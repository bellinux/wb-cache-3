50|$|Some {{of these}} agents {{are used as}} analgesics, {{including}} pentazocine, <b>phenazocine,</b> dezocine, and eptazocine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenazocine</b> {{appears to}} be a much {{stronger}} analgesic with fewer side effects than pentazocine, probably due to a more favorable μ/κ binding ratio. <b>Phenazocine</b> is a much more potent analgesic than pentazocine and other drugs in the benzomorphan series, most probably due to the presence of an N-phenethyl substitution, which is known to boost μ-opioid activity in many classes of opioid analgesics.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Phenazocine</b> {{was briefly}} {{used in the}} United States but fell out of favour for the {{above-mentioned}} reasons; it remains a Schedule II substance under the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Control & Prevention Act (aka Controlled Substances Act) of 1970 (CSA) but is not manufactured; other Schedule II narcotics not in use in the United States include bezitramide and metopon. The DEA ACSCN for <b>phenazocine</b> is 9715 and its 2013 annual manufacturing quota was 6 grammes ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenazocine</b> (brand names Prinadol, Narphen) is an opioid {{analgesic}} drug, which {{is related to}} pentazocine and has a similar profile of effects.|$|E
50|$|Effects of <b>phenazocine</b> include {{analgesia}} and euphoria, {{also may}} include dysphoria and hallucinations at high doses, most {{likely due to}} action at κ-opioid and σ receptors.|$|E
50|$|Saturated or {{partially}} saturated azocine rings {{form the}} core {{structure of a}} group of opioid compounds sometimes known as azocines. These include cyclazocine, pentazocine, and <b>phenazocine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Phenazocine</b> {{was invented}} in the 1950s. [...] It {{was one of a}} number of benzomorphan opioids (including pentazocine, dezocine, and cyclazocine) {{developed}} in the search for non-addictive strong analgesics.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenazocine</b> {{was once}} widely used, and was mainly {{supplied}} as 5 mg tablets of the hydrobromide salt for sublingual use (Narphen, Prinadol and other names), but its use was discontinued in the United Kingdom in 2001.|$|E
50|$|Consequently, <b>phenazocine</b> is some 4x {{the potency}} of {{morphine}} as an analgesic. Also it does not cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, making it more suitable than morphine {{for the treatment of}} biliary or pancreatic pain.|$|E
50|$|Cyclazocine {{is a mixed}} opioid agonist/antagonist {{related to}} dezocine, {{pentazocine}} and <b>phenazocine.</b> This family of opioid drugs is called the benzomorphans or benzazocines. It is a KOR agonist and MOR partial agonist, and also has high affinity for the DOR.|$|E
50|$|Phenadoxone (Heptalgin, Morphidone, Heptazone) is an opioid {{analgesic}} {{of the open}} chain class (methadone and relatives) invented in Germany by Hoechst in 1947. It {{is one of a}} handful of useful synthetic analgesics which were used in the United States for various lengths of time in the 20 or so years after the end of the Second World War but which were withdrawn from the market for various or no known reason and which now are mostly in Schedule I of the United States' Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or (like <b>phenazocine</b> and bezitramide) in Schedule II but not produced or marketed in the US. Others on this list are ketobemidone (Ketogin), dextromoramide (Dimorlin, Palfium and others), <b>phenazocine</b> (Narphen and Prinadol), dipipanone (Diconal, Pipadone and Wellconal), piminodine (Alvodine), propiram (Algeril), anileridine (Leritine) and alphaprodine (Nisentil).|$|E
50|$|Propiram {{exhibits}} weak {{opioid antagonist}} {{activity on the}} mu receptor—quite a bit weaker than its agonist effects—and the effect on kappa and delta opioid, sigma receptors, or the NMDA system are not well understood. Other drugs of the partial mu-opioid agonist/antagonist type include meptazinol, buprenorphine, butorphanol, <b>phenazocine,</b> nalbuphine, pentazocine, dezocine and its relatives.|$|E
50|$|Fluorophen, or fluorofen, is a {{fluorinated}} analogue of <b>phenazocine,</b> an opioid drug of the benzomorphan group, {{which was}} {{developed as a}} radioligand {{for the purpose of}} labeling opioid receptors during PET scans (with 18F). Unlike most other benzomorphan derivatives, fluorophen acts as a full agonist of the opioid receptors with preferential affinity for the μ-opioid receptor (approximately 6x that of morphine), similar but slightly lower affinity for the δ-opioid receptor (equipotent to D-Leu5enkephalin), and very low affinity for the κ-opioid receptor.|$|E
50|$|Similarly to μ-opioid {{receptor}} (MOR) agonists, KOR agonists are potently analgesic, {{and have}} been employed clinically {{in the treatment of}} pain. However, KOR agonists also produce side effects such as dysphoria, hallucinations, and dissociation, which has limited their clinical usefulness. Examples of KOR agonists that have been used medically as analgesics include butorphanol, nalbuphine, levorphanol, levallorphan, pentazocine, <b>phenazocine,</b> and eptazocine. Difelikefalin (CR845, FE-202845) and CR665 (FE-200665, JNJ-38488502) are peripherally restricted KOR agonists lacking the CNS side effects of centrally active KOR agonists and are currently under clinical investigation as analgesics.|$|E
5000|$|Difelikefalin (INN) (developmental code names CR845, FE-202845), {{also known}} as D-Phe-D-Phe-D-Leu-D-Lys-carboxylic acid (as the acetate salt), is an {{analgesic}} opioid peptide acting as a peripherally specific, highly selective agonist of the κ-opioid receptor (KOR). It is under development by Cara Therapeutics as an intravenous agent {{for the treatment of}} postoperative pain. An oral formulation has also been developed. Due to its peripheral selectivity, difelikefalin lacks the central side effects like sedation, dysphoria, and hallucinations of previous KOR-acting analgesics such as pentazocine and <b>phenazocine.</b> In addition to use as an analgesic, difelikefalin is also being investigated for the treatment of pruritus (itching). Difelikefalin has completed phase II clinical trials for postoperative pain and has demonstrated significant and [...] "robust" [...] clinical efficacy, along with being safe and well-tolerated. It is also in phase II clinical trials for uremic pruritus in hemodialysis patients.|$|E
50|$|Pentazocine is a synthetically-prepared prototypical mixed agonist-antagonist {{narcotic}} (opioid analgesic) drug of the benzomorphan {{class of}} opioids {{used to treat}} moderate to moderately severe pain. Pentazocine is sold under several brand names, such as Fortral, Sosegon, Talwin NX (with the μ-antagonist naloxone, will cause withdrawal in opioid dependent persons on injection), Talwin, Talwin PX (without naloxone), Fortwin (Lactate injectable form) and Talacen (with acetaminophen). This compound may exist as one of two enantiomers, named (+)-pentazocine and (−)-pentazocine. (−)-pentazocine is a κ-opioid receptor agonist, while (+)-pentazocine is not, instead displaying a ten-fold greater affinity for the σ receptor. Usually, in its oral formulations, it is combined with naloxone so as to prevent people from crushing the tablets, dissolving them in a solvent (like water) and injecting them for a high (as naloxone is not orally bioavailable it produces no effect when the formulation is used orally, but it blocks the opioid effects of pentazocine if injected intravenously for a high). Related drugs include <b>phenazocine,</b> dezocine, cyclazocine and several chemicals used in research on the central nervous system.|$|E
50|$|Buprenorphine and {{dezocine}} are partial agonists of the MOR but antagonists of the KOR. Contrarily, eptazocine is an antagonist of the MOR but an agonist of the KOR; {{the same}} is also true for nalorphine and levallorphan. A variety of partial agonists or mixed agonists-antagonists of the MOR and KOR are also marketed, and include butorphanol, levorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, and <b>phenazocine.</b> All of the aforementioned drugs may be described as opioid modulators instead of as pure antagonists. With the sole exception of nalorphine, all of the preceding are used as analgesics (by virtue {{of the fact that}} both MOR and KOR agonism independently confer pain relief). However, these opioid analgesics have atypical properties in comparison to the prototypical pure MOR full agonist opioid analgesics, such as less or no risk of respiratory depression for MOR partial agonists and antagonists, reduced or no euphoria, abuse potential, and dependence liability with MOR partial agonists/antagonists, and use- and dose-limiting side effects such as dysphoria and hallucinations with KOR agonists. In addition, by virtue of its KOR antagonism, buprenorphine (as buprenorphine/samidorphan (ALKS-5461) or buprenorphine/naltrexone to block its MOR agonism) is under investigation for the treatment of depression and cocaine dependence, as are other KOR antagonists such as CERC-501 (LY-2456302) and, previously, JDTic and PF-4455242 (both discontinued due to toxicity concerns).|$|E
40|$|A {{blind trial}} was {{undertaken}} to compare <b>phenazocine</b> with pethidine. Both drugs {{were used to}} supplement nitrous oxide and oxygen anaesthesia in cases in which spontaneous respiration was possible during maintenance. Forty-six cases were given pethidine and forty-five cases <b>phenazocine.</b> There {{was no difference between}} the two drugs in their ability to provide satisfactory anaesthesia, or in the degree of respiratory depression, or in the effect upon the blood pressure. Recovery of reflexes following anaesthesia was more rapid in the <b>phenazocine</b> group but the results were not statis-tically significant. The literature upon <b>phenazocine</b> was discussed together with {{the results of the present}} trial. <b>Phenazocine</b> (Narphen) is a synthetic analgesic drug which has a potency twenty times greater than that of morphine. It is claimed that despite this potency the incidence of side effects is low. <b>Phenazocine</b> has been used as an analgesic in patients with pain and postoperatively. It was thought that such a powerful analgesic with minimal side effects might be of use in anaes-thesia as a supplement to nitrous oxide and oxygen and that it might replace pethidine, which cannot be said to be ideal for this purpose. In a small group of cases <b>phenazocine</b> was used as an intravenous agent instead of pethidine to supplement nitrous oxide and oxygen anaes-thesia and, except for some degree of respiratory depression, it seemed satisfactory. A blind trial was therefore undertaken to compare phenazo-cine with pethidine. One hundred patients were anaesthetized for this trial. METHOD Ampoules of pethidine 100 mg in 2 ml were used, which were exactly the same size and shape as ampoules containing <b>phenazocine</b> 2 mg in 2 ml; 100 mg of pethidine has been said to be approxi-mately equal to 2 mg of <b>phenazocine</b> The word-ing on the ampoules was obliterated with black adhesive tape. The ampoule containing one of the drugs was marked with a strip of green adhesive tape by an independent person. The identity of the marked drug was not known until after the trial. This marking was re-applied at about the fiftieth case. Premedication consisted of either papaveretum 20 mg and hyoscine 0. 44 mg or pethidine and atropine with dose graded to the size or medical fitness of the patient...|$|E
40|$|In the {{never ending}} {{search for a}} {{completely}} non-addictive substitute for morphine, May and Eddy (1959) recently described a new benzomorphan derivative called <b>phenazocine</b> (dl- 2 ’-hydroxy- 5, 9 -dimethyl- 2 -phenethyl- 6, 7 -benzomorphan hydrobromide) which they re-ported to be approximately 9 times as potent as morphine as an analgesic in mice. Preliminary work reported by Deneau and co-workers (1959) indicated that doses of <b>phenazocine</b> of 10 mg/kg and above can suppress morphine abstinence symptoms in morphine addicted monkeys. Fraser and Isbell (1959, 1960) evaluated <b>phenazocine</b> for its addictive properties in man and reported that <b>phenazocine</b> is capable of both supporting mor-phine addiction in man and of producing (lirect addiction in its own right. Subjects which had been addicted to <b>phenazocine</b> and then with-drawn from the drug exhibited definite morphine-like abstinence symptoms although these tended to be less severe than abstinence symptoms oc-curring after withdrawal of equivalent amounts of morphine. These investigators did nevertheless l) oint out that “the severity of abstinence in the one patient who received NIH 7519 (phena-zocine) for 127 days shows that under conditions of abuse, abstinence from this drug can, in some lersons at least, be as severe as abstinence from morphine. ” The clinical analgesic activity of <b>phenazocine</b> has been attested to by numerous investi-gators (Eckenhoff, 1959; Sadove et al., 1959; Wa]lenstein et at. 3; and many others).

40|$|The {{scratching}} {{caused by}} a standard, submaximal dose of bombesin (0. 1 0,g i. c. v.) in rats is antagonized in a stereospecific and dose-related manner by systemically (but not centrally) ad-ministered benzomorphan analgesics; other commonly used opioids and opiold peptides are ineffective at behaviorally non-depressent doses. Naloxone attenuates the antibombesin effect of ethylketocyclazocine in a stereospecific, potent and dose-related manner. Tolerance develops to the inhibitory action of ethylketocyclazocine (and <b>phenazocine).</b> Multiple injections of morphine do not influence the ability of ethylketocydazocine or of <b>phenazocine</b> to antagonize bombesin. Furthermore, when mu opiate receptors are occluded by buprenorphine, ethylketocy-clazocine and <b>phenazocine</b> can still antagonize bombesin-in-duced scratching.

40|$|<b>Phenazocine,</b> in {{doses of}} 1. 4 mg/ 70 kg and 2. 1 mg/ 70 kg, was {{compared}} with 10. 5 mg/ 70 kg morphine under "double blind " {{conditions for the}} relief of postoperative pain. All the patients had undergone abdominal surgery and all the interviews were carried out by one assessor.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the [delta]-selective agonist [D-Pen 2,D-Pen 5]enkephalin (DPDPE) on the antinociception {{produced}} by intracerebroventricular (i. c. v.) administration of the [mu] agonists morphine, [D-Ala 2, NMePhe 4,Gly-ol 5]enkephalin (DAGO), [NMePhe 3,D-Pro 4]morphiceptin (PLO 17), [beta]-endorphin, <b>phenazocine,</b> etorphine and sufentanil was studied in mice. Only the antinociceptive effects of morphine and normorphine were modulated by i. c. v. coadministration of a dose of DPDPE which did not prodice any significant antinociception alone. Both the morphine and normorphine dose-response lines were displaced to the left {{in the presence of}} DPDPE. The [delta]-selective antagonist ICII 74, 864 (N,N-diallyl-Tyr-Aib-Aib-Phe-Leu-OH) (where Aib is [alpha]-aminoisobutyric acid) blocked the modulation of morphine antinociception by DPDPE. ICI 174, 864 alone failed to produce either a significant increase or decrease of morphine, <b>phenazocine,</b> etorphine or [beta]-endorphin antinociception. The {{results of the present study}} provide support for the hypothesis that the enkephalins may function to modulate antinociception produced at the [mu] receptor; such modulation may come about via the existence of an opioid [mu]-[delta] receptor complex. The [mu] receptors existing in such a complex may be selectively activated by morphine and normorphine, but not the other [mu] agonists studied here. Thus, the enkephalins may function both to directly initiate, as well as to modulate, some forms of supraspinal [mu] receptor-mediated antinociception...|$|E

40|$|A specific, {{sensitive}} and aide procedure for the extraction from plasma and determination by gas chromatography of benzomorphan derivatives is presented. Be~omorphana (BM) derivatives are compounds with strong analgesic proper-ties (1). In recent years pentazocine (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -hexahydro- 6, 11 -dimnthyl- 3 -(3 -m~thyl- 2 -butenyl) - 2, 6 -methano- 3 -benzazocin- 8 -ol), a BM derivative is being increasingly used therapeutically.

40|$|EDITORIAL COMMENT There is {{experimental}} {{evidence from the}} studies of these authors that <b>phenazocine</b> (Narphen) might be a particularly suitable analgesic {{for the treatment of}} biliary pain. The pain of patients suffering from biliary tract disease is usually treated by administering morphine or pethidine, with or without an antispasmodic drug such as aminophylline; but both these analgesics cause spasm of the sphincters controlling the flow of bile into the duodenum. In 1936, Butsch, McGowan, and Walters reported typical biliary colic occurring after giving morphine to patients following cholecystectomy and T-tube drainage of the common duct, and were able to correlate this pain with a rise in common bile duct pressure. Bergh and Layne (1940) attributed post-morphine pain to spasm of the sphincter of Oddi...|$|E
40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} affects {{millions of}} people. Although diabetics can lead relatively normal lives, all treatments {{for the disease}} are symptomatic and not curative. The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to determine whether the sensitivity to opiates and other selected centrally-acting drugs in animals is altered by streptozotocin (STZ) -induced diabetes. A second objective was to determine which aspect of the diabetic syndrome primarily was responsible for the altered sensitivity. Other experiments were performed in an attempt to elucidate the mechanism whereby this altered sensitivity occurred. STZ-induced diabetes or dextrose-induced transient hyperglycemia did not {{have a significant effect on}} the duration of hexobarbital-induced anesthesia. Similarly, following 5 days treatment with phenobarbital, the duration of hexobarbital-induced anesthesia was reduced equally in both control and STZ-induced diabetic mice. STZ-induced diabetes did not alter the acute oral LD 50 of nicotine. The antinociceptive potency of morphine as determined by the tail-flick test was significantly decreased (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) in STZ-induced diabetic mice and mice pretreated with equimolar doses of hypertonic dextrose or fructose. STZ-induced diabetic rats and spontaneously diabetic mice were also significantly less sensitive to the antinociceptive effects of morphine as quantitated by the tail-flick test. The ability of morphine to inhibit phenquuinone-induced writhing was attenuated in STZ-induced diabetic mice. Hypoglycemic mice were significantly more sensitive to morphine in the tail-flick test. Insulin reversal of dextrose-induced and STZ-induced diabetic hyperglycemia returned sensitivity to morphine-induced antinociception in the tail-flick test to control values. Pretreatment with the non-metabolizable sugar 3 - 0 -methylglucose at a dose equimolar to the doses of dextrose and fructose had no effect on morphine potency. The antinociceptive potencies of <b>phenazocine</b> and levorphanol were altered similarly to that of morphine, but the potencies of methadone, propoxyphene and meperidine were not altered by changes in blood glucose levels. The LD 50 of morphine but not methadone was significantly decreased in STZ-induced diabetic mice. These results confirm the selectivity of the STZ-induced diabetes to alter the sensitivity of morphine and not methadone, and are provocative since they show that the lethal effect of morphine is altered in the opposite direction from the antinociceptive potency. Levels of morphine in the brains of STZ-induced diabetic and insulin-treated STZ-induced diabetic mice were not significantly different from control mice. The durations of action of morphine in STZ-induced diabetic and control mice were similar, although the level of antinociception in the diabetic mice was lower at all time points. STZ-induced diabetes in mice did not alter serum osmolarity and brain water content. Mice receiving various pretreatments (STZ-induced diabetes, STZ-induced diabetes plus insulin, dextrose, fasting or fasting plus insulin) were subjected to analyses of their serum glucose levels, serum insulin levels, and brain glucose levels. From these data only blood glucose levels correlated (inversely) with the antinociceptive potency of morphine. The results of these experiments led to the hypothesis that the hyperglycemia was the aspect of diabetes principally responsible for selectively affecting the potency of certain opiate-like pharmacologic agents...|$|E
