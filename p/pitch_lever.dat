25|$|The Do 32 was {{structurally}} very simple, with {{a square}} section, tapering fuselage behind the pilot. The BMW 6012L turbine and compressor {{were placed on}} top of the fuselage, immediately behind the rotor pylon. Its exhaust impinged upon a large rectangular rudder, built to resist thermal stresses, for yaw control. The horizontal tailplane was swept. The pilot sat in front of the rotor pylon, on a simple seat, carried on the lower longerons. He controlled the plane of the two-bladed rotor directly with a long curved hanging arm, and its pitch with a conventional collective <b>pitch</b> <b>lever</b> by his left side. The rudder pedals were almost straight {{out in front of him}} on a strut that also carried, beyond his feet, some simple instruments. This member also formed part of the simple three-legged undercarriage, each strut ending with an unsprung foot.|$|E
5000|$|Although the Oxford was {{equipped}} with fixed-pitch wooden or Fairey-Reed metal propellers, the cockpit contained a propeller <b>pitch</b> <b>lever,</b> {{which had to be}} moved from [...] "Coarse" [...] to [...] "Fine" [...] for landing. This was to reinforce this important step for trainee pilots.|$|E
50|$|For takeoff and landing, {{the rotor}} {{was driven by}} tip-jets. The air was {{produced}} by compressors driven through a clutch off the main engines. This was fed through ducting in {{the leading edge of}} the wings and up to the rotor head. Each engine supplied air for a pair of opposite rotors; the compressed air was mixed with fuel and burned. As a torqueless rotor system, no anti-torque correction system was required, though propeller pitch was controlled by the rudder pedals for low-speed yaw control. The propellers provided thrust for translational flight while the rotor autorotated. The cockpit controls included a cyclic and collective <b>pitch</b> <b>lever,</b> as in a conventional helicopter.|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} {{a mechanism for}} permitting convenient manual or servo-powered control of a boom assembly, which is rotatably positionable about yaw and pitch axes by means of releasably locking, yaw and pitch torque-limiting mechanisms, each {{of which may be}} locked, unlocked, and positioned by respective yaw and <b>pitch</b> <b>levers.</b> The boom may be longitudinally projected and withdrawn by rotating a boom extension/retraction crank. Torque limiting is provided by spring loaded clutch mechanisms, whereby positioning forces applied to the handles are effective to move the boom unless overcome by greater opposing forces, sufficient to overcome the torque applied by the torque limiting clutch mechanisms. In operation, a structure positionable by the invention (e. g., and end-effector or robot arm) may be rotatably moved about yaw and pitch axes by moving a selected one of the three levers...|$|R
50|$|The initial {{discovery}} {{of the problem with}} the vessel’s propulsion system occurred when the Barberi’s chief engineer went up to the pilothouse after the collision. The engineer found that even though the <b>pitch</b> <b>levers</b> were in the neutral position, the propeller pitch indicator for the New York-end unit read out 50% thrust. This indication was confirmed by the stream of water that was being pushed away from the stern of the vessel. The chief engineer then unsuccessfully attempted to bring the propulsion unit to zero pitch using the pilothouse controls. Control of the propulsion units was transferred to the engine room, where the crew used the units’ local controls to bring the pitch to zero. When the crew later attempted to back the Barberi out of the terminal using these local controls, both propulsion units functioned normally.|$|R
50|$|The Juno-60 {{provides}} a single triangle-wave variable-rate LFO for modulation options. This is routed into the DCO to create pitch vibrato and pulse-width modulation, plus into the lowpass filter {{to generate a}} tremolo effect. All three choices can be used simultaneously, each with their own individual depth settings. The LFO can then either be triggered manually by the left hand using a large button above the <b>pitch</b> bend <b>lever</b> or set to engage automatically whenever a key was pressed. The LFO also features a slider to adjust a delay time for when it will be triggered automatically.|$|R
50|$|The bladess of the three-bladed {{main rotor}} are {{attached}} to the rotor head via a lightweight and strong interleaving steel plates while tie-rods absorb direct centrifugal force under tension. The blade levers are connected via ball joints to the arms of a control spider, the cone of which being actuated up and down by the collective <b>pitch</b> <b>lever</b> in order to change to pitch of all of the blades; an irreversible mechanism is present to prevent blade loads being transferred back to the control stick. The blades are supported when still or at slow rotational speeds by droop stops, which serve to keep a level of clearance between the blades and the fuselage even under high wind conditions; these stops are withdrawn above 100 RPM so that full freedom of movement for effective flight is possible.|$|E
50|$|The Sycamore {{is powered}} by a single Alvis Leonides piston engine, capable of {{outputting}} 550 hp of thrust. The engine is mounted on below and {{to the rear of the}} main rotor on a flexible mounting in order to reduce vibrations. It is isolated within a fireproof casing, the compartment is also fitted with fire extinguishing equipment that conformed with the relevant regulations of the era. Cooling is achieved via air drawn through a forward-set grill, actively cooling the gearbox prior to passing through the engine cowling and exiting the fuselage. Control of the engine is linked to the collective <b>pitch</b> <b>lever,</b> power being automatically controlled by the rotor pitch setting being commanded; fine adjustment of engine power is achieved via twisting actions on the pitch handle lever. The Sycamore had a relatively high rotor speed for the era, which was claimed to deliver increased smoothness during flight and provide for a safety advantage in the event of engine failure.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "X" [...] in OB-X {{originally}} {{stood for}} the number of voice-cards (notes of polyphony) installed. It came in four, six, and eight-voice models with polyphonic portamento, and sample and hold. Even the 4-voice model was expensive at US$4,595. The entire range used [...] "paddle" [...] levers for pitch and modulation, Oberheim's answer to the [...] "wheel" [...] controls of the Prophet-5. Though these controls were never as popular as the standard pitch and modulation wheels, the philosophy was to mimic the motion of a guitar player bending the strings on their guitar. On most other synthesizers the pitch bend wheel was on the left, and the modulation wheel to the right of it; on the OB-X Oberheim placed them in the opposite relative positions. In addition to this unique configuration the polarity of the paddles was distinctive; the player would pull back on the <b>pitch</b> <b>lever</b> to bend the pitch sharp, and push forward to bend flat.|$|E
2500|$|Design {{work on the}} Hawk utility/passenger {{autogyro}} {{began in}} 1996 and the first prototype, the two seat H2X, first flew on 4 February 1997. [...] It was later modified to include a third seat and renamed the Hawk III. [...] The production prototype, a four-seater named the Hawk 4, [...] was {{significantly different from the}} Hawk III in detail but retained the pod and mid-line pusher engine configuration, combined with low stub wings, twin booms and fins. Changes between the Hawk III and 4, apart from cabin revisions to accommodate the extra seat, included a new constant chord, aluminium rotor in place of the earlier tapered, composite blade. [...] The rotor was also lowered and the <b>pitch</b> control <b>levers</b> enclosed within a shallower fairing. [...] The wings and fixed tailplane were cropped, so that they no longer extended beyond the booms and fins, the rudders were shortened so that the tailplane no longer needed cut-outs for their movement and extra, short, inboard rudders were added. [...] Successive engine changes increased the power by almost a factor of two.|$|R

5000|$|A {{carburetor}} is used {{to provide}} the air-fuel mixture. Carbureted engines are susceptible to carburetor icing, a condition most {{likely to occur in}} conditions of a low 11 °C (20 °F) difference between the outside air temperature and dew point (the [...] "dew point spread"), as well as visible signs of moisture in the atmosphere. Icing can lead to loss of engine power and, if not corrected, total shutdown of the engine. A carburetor heat control {{is used to}} supply heated air to the carburetor; this can prevent or cure icing, but also causes a reduction in engine power output because hot air is less dense, enriching the fuel-air mixture. The carburetor heat control is a simple plunger-type control mounted on the center console near the collective <b>pitch</b> control <b>lever.</b> Pulling the control up slides a gate valve near the carburetor that admits warm air from a scoop on the exhaust system. The R22 employs a carburetor air temperature gauge, marked to indicate temperatures conducive to icing. The Beta II version of the R22 also includes a [...] "carburetor heat assist" [...] which automatically applies carburetor heat when the collective is lowered below a certain point. When icing conditions are present, carburetor heat is required to prevent icing around the butterfly valve from the pressure drop at that point. As the carburetor air temperature (CAT) indicator does not read correctly below 18 in of intake manifold air pressure, icing conditions require applying full carburetor heat below 18 in of manifold pressure. A placard indicating this requirement is located on the CAT indicator and in the Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH).|$|R
5000|$|The pod seats two {{side-by-side}} {{behind a}} full clear forward transparency. Its skin is carbon fibre over a titanium alloy tube frame. Tandem controls are fitted, with {{two sets of}} anti-torque pedals and a T-shaped cyclic control centrally mounted on a console; the single collective <b>pitch</b> <b>lever</b> is placed between the seats. A governor sets the throttle {{in the absence of}} pilot input and trim is applied electrically. Small baggage can be stored in under seat lockers. Cabin access is through forward hinged doors in each side. [...] A [...] Rotax 914 turbocharged, liquid cooled, flat four piston engine with narrow rectangular cheek radiators is mounted behind the seats and partly exposed at the rear, driving a two blade main rotor. [...] The helicopter lands on skids, transversely braced by a pair of airfoil section struts and positioned below the pod on two pairs of similar outward leaning struts, producing a skid track of 1.585 m.|$|E

The aircraft was also stowed in a trailer, transported, unfolded and flown. The heavy rotor could be spun up before takeoff with zero pitch, containing enough energy for a rapid initial vertical climb or jump start, autogyro fashion. All three were eventually lost in accidents with different causes. Though Dornier had hopes of large Army orders, none followed. Agricultural applications were considered, and there was a design project for the Do 32Z, a two-seat version with a bigger engine, but no more manned Do 32s flew. The unflown fourth prototype is on display at the Deutsches Museum, painted as the first prototype D-HOPA. The Do 32U was a pilotless version of the Do 32E, very similar, apart from the missing seat. The Do 32K, developed into the Do 34, was also an unmanned drone with compressed air-driven rotors, but without a fuselage.|$|E
40|$|The X- 22 A {{has four}} ducted {{propellers}} and four engines. The engines {{are connected to}} a common system of rotating shafts which distribute propulsive power to the four propellers. Changes {{in the direction of}} the thrust vector are accomplished by rotating the ducts, which are interconnected so that all rotate through the same angle. Thrust magnitude is determined by a collective <b>pitch</b> <b>lever,</b> very similar to a helicopter. There are four variable stability system (VSS) controllers: thrust, pitch, roll, and yaw, and three artificial feel servos for the evaluation pilot cockpit controls, each employing electrohydraulic servos. Longitudinal flying qualities for STOL landing approach, and lateral-directional flying qualities and control power requirements for STOL landing approach are discussed. Attention is given to the data acquisition and processing system...|$|E
5000|$|The Norélic was a {{prototype}} two-seat, single rotor helicopter {{with an unusual}} anti-torque system, without a manual cyclic pitch control. Its two crew {{sat side by side}} with large, single curvature transparencies in front of them but with open cockpit sides. [...] The [...] Mathis G.7R seven-cylinder radial engine was immediately behind them, with its crankshaft vertical; the Norélic was the first French helicopter with its engine in this orientation. The driveshaft rose through the fuselage to the rotor hub, which was slightly offset forwards on a two side-by-side pillar, faired support. The Norélic had a two-blade articulated rotor with undamped flapping hinges; the blades had the same chord and aerofoil from hub to tip and were each built around a single solid spar with ribs and a thin metal skin, all clamped together. Blade pitch was automatically controlled by small servo or pilot airfoils mounted on rods at right-angles to the rotors. Though reminiscent of the servos on the Hiller 360, those on the Norélic were themselves flappable and were intended to control both cyclic pitch and the flapping amplitude of the main rotors. Thus the cockpit cyclic pitch control was absent, and instead roll was produced by sideways motion of the hub via its parallel support pillars, which separated the centres of lift and gravity. Effects due to variations in the position of the centre of gravity could be trimmed out by longitudinal movements of the hub. The servo blades also served as rotor speed governors; restrained by springs, they could slide outward as the rotor speed began to increase, increasing the pitch and the associated drag to decrease the speed. Collective pitch was thus primarily determined by throttle setting, though there was a collective <b>pitch</b> override <b>lever.</b>|$|R
40|$|A piloted {{simulation}} {{experiment was}} conducted using the NASA Ames Research Center Vertical Motion Simulator to evaluate two cockpit display formats designed for manual control on steep instrument approaches for a civil transport tiltrotor aircraft. The first display included a four-cue (<b>pitch,</b> roll, power <b>lever</b> position, and nacelle angle movement prompt) flight director. The second display format provided instantaneous {{flight path angle}} information together with other symbols for terminal area guidance. Pilots evaluated these display formats for an instrument approach task which required a level flight conversion from airplane-mode flight to helicopter-mode flight while decelerating to the nominal approach airspeed. Pilots tracked glide slopes of 6, 9, 15 and 25 degrees, terminating in a hover for a vertical landing on a 150 feet square vertipad. Approaches were conducted with low visibility and ceilings and with crosswinds and turbulence, with all aircraft systems functioning normally and were carried through to a landing. Desired approach and tracking performance was achieved with generally satisfactory handling qualities using either display format on glide slopes up through 15 degrees. Evaluations with both display formats for a 25 degree glide slope revealed serious problems with glide slope tracking at low airspeeds in crosswinds {{and the loss of}} the intended landing spot from the cockpit field of view...|$|R
