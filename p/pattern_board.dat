40|$|Multiple-camera {{systems are}} {{emerging}} gradually. In order to let audiences feel comfortable when cameras are switched {{or when a}} free viewpoint video generated is shown, colour correction between cameras is necessary. Colour correction has usually two steps; {{the first step is}} to adjust camera parameters such as gain, brightness and aperture before capturing, and the second step is to modify captured videos by image processing. This paper deals with the latter step, which does not need a colour <b>pattern</b> <b>board</b> to be prepared, uses SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) to detect correspondences for occlusion handling, treats RGB channels independently, and transforms the distorted videos with a non-linear function. Our experimental results show that there was a better correlation between the corrected videos than that between captured ones. (author abst.)

5000|$|It is {{important}} to realize that Lau kata kati's <b>patterned</b> <b>board</b> is the basis of other games, in particular, Dash-guti and Egara-guti, as the boards of those two games are an expansion.

This family includes games like Rimau-rimau, Bagha-Chall, and Main Tapal Empat. In contrast, Leopard games are also hunt games, but use a more triangular board and not an Alquerque-based board. Similarly, Fox games are also hunt games, but use more of a cross <b>patterned</b> <b>board.</b>|$|R

They were played {{in parts of the}} Empire as far away as Turkey and France and are still played today, especially in Italy. All of the games are two-player abstract strategy board games. Normally, the game is played with three hunters and one bear on a <b>patterned</b> <b>board.</b> It bears similarity to the hunt games such as the Fox games, Rimau-rimau, and Bagha-Chall, however, there are no captures involved. The three hunters are trying to hem in the bear, and block its movements.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, Chilkat {{blankets}} were interred in graves, {{cut into pieces}} and distributed to mourners, or taken from the community into museums or private collections. Designs became limited, possibly due to a dwindling number of painted <b>pattern</b> <b>boards</b> from which to copy. It fell upon weavers to generate new designs, which became simplified as weavers decreased in numbers. Of these few remaining weavers, Jennie Thlunaut, [...] "the longest-lived member of their fraternity ... had absorbed sufficient knowledge of the formline tradition ... to keep a large measure of the design structure intact" [...] in her original Chilkat designs.|$|R

5000|$|Peralikatuma is a two-player {{abstract}} strategy {{board game}} from Sri Lanka. It {{is a game}} related to draughts (checkers) Alquerque as players hop over one another's pieces when capturing them. But its actual closest relatives are Sixteen Soldiers and Kotu Ellima which are also games from the Indian Subcontinent. All three games use the same board which consist of an Alquerque board, and attached on each of its four sides is a triangular <b>patterned</b> <b>board.</b> The only difference between the three games is {{in the number of}} pieces. In Sixteen Soldiers, each player has 16 pieces hence the name of the game. In Peralikatuma, each player has 23 pieces. In Kotu Ellima, each player has 24 pieces.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two types}} of movements: non-{{capturing}} moves, and capturing moves. A piece can be moved one space (non-capturing move) per turn. The move must follow the <b>pattern</b> on the <b>board.</b> Or a piece can capture an enemy piece (capturing move). This move must also follow the <b>pattern</b> on the <b>board</b> also. Captures are similar to those in Draughts and Alquerque. A player's piece jumps over an adjacent enemy piece, and lands on a vacant spot beyond it. The jump need not be straight as long as it lands on a spot immediately beyond the enemy piece and follows the <b>pattern</b> on the <b>board.</b> Captured pieces are removed from the board. Captures are compulsory.|$|R
5000|$|Vultures {{can either}} move one space onto a vacant point per turn {{following}} the <b>pattern</b> on the <b>board,</b> or capture one crow per turn. Capture {{is the same}} as in Draughts, where a vulture can jump over an adjacent crow piece and land on a vacant point on the other side. The jump must follow the <b>pattern</b> of the <b>board,</b> and be in a straight line. Multiple captures are not allowed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{most common}} {{forensic}} activity is searching a hard disk for string of data. Nowadays, investigators and analysts are increasingly experiencing large, even terabyte sized data sets when conducting digital investigations. Therefore consecutive searching can take weeks to complete successfully. There are two primary search methods: index-based search and bitwise search. Index-based searching is very fast {{after the initial}} indexing but initial indexing takes a long time. In this paper, we discuss a high speed bitwise search model for large-scale digital forensic investigations. We used <b>pattern</b> matching <b>board,</b> which is generally used for network security, to search for string and complex regular expressions. Our results indicate that in many cases, the use of <b>pattern</b> matching <b>board</b> can substantially increase the performance of digital forensic search tools.

5000|$|Egara-guti is a two-player {{abstract}} strategy {{game from}} India, specifically from Central Provinces. [...] The game {{is related to}} Draughts {{and even more so}} to Alquerque. Pieces are captured by leaping over them. Egara-Guti consists of a Lau kata kati board, but with the addition of two lines connecting the two triangles and running through them. Egara-guti belongs to a specific category of games called Indian War-games, and the other games in this category are Lau kata kati, Dash-guti, Pretwa, Gol-skuish. All Indian War-games have one important thing in common, and that is that all the pieces are laid out on the grid <b>patterned</b> <b>board</b> in the beginning, with only one vacant point in the center. This forces the first move to be played on the central point, and captured by the other player's piece.|$|R
