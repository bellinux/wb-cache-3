5|$|A {{feature of}} the wing, which contributed greatly to its success, was an {{innovative}} spar boom design, made up of five square tubes that fitted into each other. As the wing thinned out along its span the tubes were progressively cut away {{in a similar fashion}} to a leaf spring; two of these booms were linked together by an alloy web, creating a lightweight and very strong main spar. The undercarriage legs were attached to <b>pivot</b> <b>points</b> built into the inner, rear section of the main spar and retracted outwards and slightly backwards into wells in the non-load-carrying wing structure. The resultant narrow undercarriage track was considered to be an acceptable compromise as this reduced the bending loads on the main-spar during landing.|$|E
25|$|The {{undercarriage}} mountings were redesigned and the undercarriage {{doors were}} bowed {{in cross section}} allowing the legs to sit lower in the wells, eliminating the upper-wing blisters over the wheel wells and landing gear <b>pivot</b> <b>points.</b>|$|E
25|$|The gun emplacements are symmetrical, {{single-storeyed}} {{structures of}} off-form concrete, waffle slab roof supported on three columns with earth fill on top, Australian-designed circular recoil pit with central pad and outlying rail for gun carriage traverse, side magazines {{of concrete and}} concrete block construction. Camouflage net <b>pivot</b> <b>points</b> are extant, and doors remain on the lower emplacement magazines. The robust off-form concrete construction is unlike the two-storeyed coastal battery gun emplacements of Moreton Bay, where timber as well as concrete was used structurally.|$|E

50|$|In {{financial}} markets, a <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> is a {{price level}} {{that is used by}} traders as a possible indicator of market movement. A <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> is calculated as an average of significant prices (high, low, close) from the performance of a market in the prior trading period. If the market in the following period trades above the <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> it is usually evaluated as a bullish sentiment, whereas trading below the <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> is seen as bearish.|$|R

The influence of the vertical position of the <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> on energy consumption is analyzed here. The evaluation of a 3 D Walking gait is based on the energy consumption. A sthenic criterion is used to depict this evaluation. A consequent reduction of joint torques is shown with a <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> under the ground...|$|R
25|$|Tilt-A-Whirl is an {{amusement}} ride {{that consists of}} seven freely spinning cars, each holding three or four passengers, attached at fixed <b>pivot</b> <b>points</b> on a rotating platform. Designed for commercial use at amusement parks, fairs and carnivals {{in which it is}} commonly found, the Tilt-A-Whirl is commonly known for making riders experience nausea. The Tilt-A-Whirl was invented in 1926 by Herbert Sellner, who first operated it at {{an amusement}} park in White Bear Lake, Minnesota. More than likely, Sellner discovered its unpredictable dynamics not through mathematical analysis but by building one and trying it out.|$|E
25|$|The bridge {{opens to}} let {{shipping}} traffic through the Manchester Ship Canal, which occurs up to 14 times a day. The island supports the <b>pivot</b> <b>points</b> for the bridges' rotating structures, which are fixed in concrete. When in their open positions, the aqueduct and road bridge line {{up along the}} length of the island, allowing ships to traverse along each side of the ship canal. The bridge is a steel arch of girders, and connects to the pivot point via a rack and pinion system. It is the only swing road bridge on the canal that rotates from the centre, instead of from one end.|$|E
25|$|By 1960, SAC {{had begun}} moving to {{low-level}} penetration which greatly reduced radar detection distances. At the time, SAMs were ineffective against low-flying aircraft, and interceptor aircraft had {{less of a}} speed advantage at low altitudes. The Air Force's Tactical Air Command (TAC) was largely concerned with the fighter-bomber and deep strike/interdiction roles. TAC {{was in the process}} of receiving its latest design, the Republic F-105 Thunderchief, which was designed to deliver nuclear weapons fast and far, but required long runways. A simpler variable geometry wing configuration with the <b>pivot</b> <b>points</b> farther out from the aircraft's centerline was reported by NASA in 1958, which made swing-wings viable. This led Air Force leaders to encourage its use. In June 1960, the USAF issued specification SOR 183 for a long-range interdiction/strike aircraft able to penetrate Soviet air defenses at very low altitudes and high speeds. The specification also called for the aircraft to operate from short, unprepared airstrips.|$|E

25|$|The main {{tool of the}} German land forces was {{combined}} arms combat. German operational tactics relied on highly mobile offensive units, with balanced numbers of well-trained artillery, infantry, engineer and tank formations, all integrated into Panzer divisions. They relied on excellent communication systems, which enabled them to break into a position and exploit it before the enemy could react. Panzer divisions could carry out reconnaissance missions, advance to contact, defend and attack vital positions or weak spots. This ground would then be held by infantry and artillery as <b>pivot</b> <b>points</b> for further attacks. Although their tanks were not designed for tank-versus-tank combat, they could take ground and draw the enemy armour on to the division's anti-tank lines. This conserved the tanks to achieve {{the next stage of}} the offensive. The units' logistics were self-contained, allowing for three or four days of combat. The Panzer divisions would be supported by motorised and infantry divisions.|$|E
500|$|Production {{designer}} Oliver Scholl and {{his team}} worked with lead builder Pierre Bohanna to develop concept art for several battle suit options based on contemporary, real-world powered exoskeleton initiatives, such as those supported by DARPA. When director Doug Liman chose a design, the team built an aluminum prototype frame that had <b>pivot</b> <b>points</b> and hinges. Costume designer Kate Hawley contributed a gritty aesthetic design for the color palettes and surface treatments. While the design {{was meant to be}} utilitarian, it was also created so the actors could be seen in the suits and also run in them. The team created a foam mock-up of Tom Cruise so the frame could be tailored for him. The team handcrafted [...] material and [...] material battle suits in the course of almost five months. There were three versions of the battle suits: [...] "grunts, dogs, and tanks". The battle suit for Blunt's character had red slash marks sprayed on to reflect a Joan of Arc quality.|$|E
2500|$|The {{caliper brake}} is {{a class of}} cable-actuated brake in which the brake mounts to a single point above the wheel, {{theoretically}} allowing the arms to auto-centre on the rim.

[...] While some designs incorporate dual <b>pivot</b> <b>points</b> [...] the arms pivot on a sub-frame [...] the entire assembly still mounts to a single point.|$|E
50|$|A <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> and the {{associated}} support and resistance levels are often turning points for the direction of price movement in a market. In an up-trending market, the <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> and the resistance levels may represent a ceiling level in price above which the uptrend is no longer sustainable and a reversal may occur. In a declining market, a <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> and the support levels may represent a low price level of stability or a resistance to further decline.|$|R

[...] They were available on some high-end mountain bikes in the early 1990s, but declined in popularity with the rise of disc brakes. [...] The moderate performance advantage (greater power and control) they offer over cable actuated rim brakes is offset by their greater weight and complexity.|$|E

2500|$|An {{inverted}} pendulum is {{a pendulum}} {{that has its}} center of mass above its <b>pivot</b> <b>point.</b> It is often implemented with the <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> mounted on a cart that can move horizontally and may be called a cart and pole {{as shown in the}} photo. Most applications limit the pendulum to 1 degree of freedom by affixing the pole to an axis of rotation. Whereas a normal pendulum is stable when hanging downwards, an inverted pendulum is inherently unstable, and must be actively balanced in order to remain upright; this can be done either by applying a torque at the <b>pivot</b> <b>point,</b> by moving the <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> horizontally as part of a feedback system, changing the rate of rotation of a mass mounted on the pendulum on an axis parallel to the pivot axis and thereby generating a net torque on the pendulum, or by oscillating the <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> vertically. A simple demonstration of moving the <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> in a feedback system is achieved by balancing an upturned broomstick on the end of one's finger. [...] The inverted pendulum is a classic problem in dynamics and control theory and is used as a benchmark for testing control strategies.|$|R

2500|$|If two {{translations}} are parallel, we can {{slide the}} mirror pair {{of the second}} translation to cancel the inner mirror of the sequence of four, much as in the rotation case. Thus the composition of two parallel translations produces a translation by {{the sum of the}} distances in the same direction. Now suppose the translations are not parallel, and that the mirror sequence is A1, A2 (the first translation) followed by B1, B2 (the second). Then A2 and B1 must cross, say at c; and, reassociating, we are free to pivot this inner pair around c. If we pivot 90°, an interesting thing happens: now A1 and A2 intersect at a 90° angle, say at p, and so do B1 and B2, say at q. Again reassociating, we pivot the first pair around p to make B2 pass through q, and pivot the second pair around q to make A1 pass through p. The inner mirrors now coincide and cancel, and the outer mirrors are left parallel. Thus the composition of two non-parallel translations also produces a translation. Also, the three <b>pivot</b> <b>points</b> form a triangle whose edges give the head-to-tail rule of vector addition: 2(p c) + 2(c q) = 2(p q). ∎ ...|$|E
2500|$|Stock speculators {{and investors}} usually need a stock broker {{such as a}} bank or a {{brokerage}} firm to access the stock market. [...] Since the advent of Internet banking, an Internet connection is commonly used to manage positions. Using the Internet, specialized software, and a personal computer, stock speculators/investors make use of technical and fundamental analysis to help them in making decisions. They may use several information resources, {{some of which are}} strictly technical. Using the <b>pivot</b> <b>points</b> calculated from a previous day's trading, they attempt to predict the buy and sell points of the current day's trading session. These points give a cue to speculators, as to where prices will head for the day, prompting each speculator where to enter his trade, and where to exit. An added tool for the stock picker is the use of [...] "stock screens". Stock screens allow the user to input specific parameters, based on technical and/or fundamental conditions, that he or she deems desirable. Primary benefit associated with stock screens is its ability to return a small group of stocks for further analysis, among tens of thousands, that fit the requirements requested. There is criticism on the validity of using these technical indicators in analysis, and many professional stock speculators do not use them. Many full-time stock speculators and stock investors, as well as most other people in finance, traditionally have a formal education and training in fields such as economics, finance, mathematics and computer science, which may be particularly relevant to this occupation – since stock trading is not an exact science, stock prices have in general a random or chaotic behaviour and there is no proven technique for trading stocks profitably, the degree of knowledge in those fields is ultimately neglectable.|$|E

The first resistance on the up-side of the market is given by the lower width of prior trading added to the <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> price and the first support on the down-side is {{the width of the}} upper part of the prior trading range below the <b>pivot</b> <b>point.</b>|$|R

Consideration of moment equilibrium is sufficient to determine the <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> and force equilibrium is automatically satisfied. The location of the <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> obtained by this approach compared satisfactorily with the centrifuge and laboratory test data.
