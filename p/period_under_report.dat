40|$|This report {{provides}} {{wind speed}} and wind direction data at two {{sites on the}} ridge crest of a part of Kappata Hills situated south of Gadag in Karnataka. The measurements {{have been carried out}} 1989 using Second wind for the year data loggers (AL- 2002 S) with quot;Maximumquot; wind speed sensors and quot;NRGquot; wind vanes. This report provides summarized monthly mean wind speeds, wind speed-duration data, wind duration in eight directional sectors, peak wind speeds, longest lull, and estimated wind power density. Annual mean wind speeds ranging from 7. 7 mls (27. 7 km/hr) to 8. 3 mls (29. 9 km/h,r) have been found at this site during the <b>period</b> <b>under</b> <b>report...</b>|$|E
40|$|Audit quality can {{be defined}} as {{relating}} to the probability that financial statements contain no material omissions or misstatements. Previous research on the subject of audit quality relies on the assumption that large audit firms (Big 4) are homogenous in providing higher audit quality than small audit firms (non-Big 4). However, there is little evidence in extant literature supportive of quality differentials between Big 4 firms, except that the collapse of Arthur Anderson certainly undermines this assertion that large auditors are associated with higher audit quality. In this study, we develop a methodology to distinguish audit quality among Big 4 audit firms and attempt to question the homogenous audit quality assumption. In exploring this theme, this paper examines the audited disclosures made during the transition <b>period</b> <b>under</b> Financial <b>Reporting</b> Standards 136 - Impairment of Assets (the Malaysian equivalent to IAS 36) of a sample of large Malaysian listed corporations, each of whom have engaged Big 4 auditors. The results of this study are alarming, finding systemic failure on the part of Big 4 auditors in Malaysia to comply with even the most basic elements of the FRS 136 disclosure framework in relation to goodwill impairment testing. 22 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This study empirically {{investigates the}} effect of {{implementation}} of SFAS No. 131 on companies' information environments by assessing {{the effect of}} interim period financial reports. Especially, using Beaver's information content measures, it investigates the market's reaction to interim <b>period</b> financial <b>reporting</b> <b>under</b> SFAS No. 131. The empirical results of the information content test show that the adoption of SFAS No. 131 {{does not affect the}} market's reaction. For the volume reaction test, no difference was found in the reaction to the interim financial statement filing for both voluntary and nonvoluntary disclosers. This result gives evidence that the information content of the new requirements of interim financial reporting is not significantly different from that under the previous requirement...|$|R

Progress was achieved in the modification, advance and application of the concepts 'Technology assessment', 'Risk assessment' and 'Environmental impact assessment'. In the <b>period</b> <b>under</b> <b>report</b> technique-oriented studies were performed on the following themes: Technology assessment on regrowing raw materials, environmentally tolerated utilization of organic wastes, technology assessment on energy storage in supraconducting coils, PVC waste management, potentials and consequences of computer as medium, evaluation of the model test data 'heat/electricity from regrowing raw materials'.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the D- 2 mission, a German-American cooperation experiment covering cellular growth, cell activation, and cell fusion was planned under the management of the Chair for Biotechnology of Wuerzburg University. The present research project essentially served to support the scientific and technical preparation and hardware development of the mission and was designed to permit the investigation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms with regard to a possible influence of the microgravity environment on cell cultivation, activation and proliferation, on antigen presentation, on membrane processes and on reorganization and regeneration processes during electrically induced fusion. The scientific results obtained during the <b>period</b> <b>under</b> <b>report</b> should be of great importance to the design of future biological experiments on other missions (including the space station).

40|$|The present 5 th Interim Report {{documents}} the work completed during the <b>period</b> <b>under</b> <b>report.</b> Concluding specimen tests (production, tensile tests, thermal expansion measurement) confirm, among others, that sputtering {{is the best}} suitable coating process. LCF tests at ambient temperature and 400 K indicate longer fatigue lives for round specimen produced by means of EB-PVD or magnetron sputtering than for fiber/film produced flat specimen. Follow-up investigations show that crack initiation always occurs in the interface zone between the monolithic coating of the specimens and the reinforced area. The first 1, 500 m of fibers for the manufacture of prototypes were successfully coated. Objectives of Phase II of the overall project are to setup and optimize a facility for continuous coating of SiC fibers with Ti alloys and to produce a SiC-fiber reinforced Ti target component from the coated fibers.
