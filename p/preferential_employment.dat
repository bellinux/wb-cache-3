Driven by economic globalization, competition between cities for human resources, funds, and technology has become increasingly intense.

40|$|The {{preferential}} {{procurement policy}} objective of granting SMMEs preference in {{the allocation of}} government contracts is to guarantee {{a level playing field}} by granting access to the market. Yet, it is unclear what the current position of SMMEs is in participating in preferential procurement. SMMEs face obstacles that arise from inadequate resources availability in participating in preferential procurement. The purpose of this research report is primarily to explore the perceptions of the owner/and manager of SMMEs regarding significant resources that are required to influence involvement and participation in preferential procurement. Furthermore, to also explore the impact of participation in <b>preferential</b> procurement on <b>employment</b> generation. This descriptive quantitative research looks at a sample of 100 SMMEs from Gauteng that have been involved in preferential procurement at least once within a period of three years to date of participation in this study. The self administered web-based questionnaire was used to investigate perception of SMMEs on significance of resources that influence involvement and participation in preferential procurement and how their participation impacted employment generation. The results of the study indicated that SMMEs perceive administrative and supply capacity resources as the most significant resources to participate successfully. It further provided evidence of positive impact participation has on SMMEs growth in relation to employment generation. In contrast, the findings suggest that information resource is the least significant resource required to participate in preferential procurement. Lastly the results suggested that micro enterprises place less significance on supply capacity resource. Dissertation (MBA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2013.

50|$|At the 1913 federal {{election}} Fisher lost by one {{seat to the}} Commonwealth Liberal Party, led by Joseph Cook, who had left the Labor party in 1894, but Labor retained a Senate majority. Labor had submitted six referenda questions {{in conjunction with the}} 1913 election, all of which were lost. Following the 1913 election, Labor formed the Opposition, {{the first time that the}} party held that status, previously being either in government or supporting the government party. A double dissolution was called in 1914 over a proposal to abolish <b>preferential</b> <b>employment</b> for trade union members in the public service. However, after the election of 1914 had been called, the British declaration of war made the election a side issue. The incumbent caretaker government and the country went on a war footing, with mobilisation and other measures. Both parties declared complete commitment to the war effort. Despite the historic advantage that an incumbent government has at the start of war, Labor under Fisher gained a majority in both Houses, with the majority in the Senate being overwhelming. In 1915 Fisher retired as Prime Minister and leader of the party and was succeeded by Billy Hughes.|$|E
5000|$|When Rhodesia was reconstituted {{as the new}} Republic of Zimbabwe in 1980, {{accompanied}} by the electoral triumph of leading black nationalist Robert Mugabe and his Zimbabwe African National Union, Coloureds numbered about 20,000. Mugabe won the country's first general elections held under a universal franchise, despite facing militant opposition from Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) {{and a number of}} minority parties. All Coloureds registered in the Rhodesian electoral system prior to December 31, 1979 were permitted to vote, and those that did so overwhelmingly endorsed the Rhodesian Front. As a conciliatory gesture Mugabe later nominated a leading member of the Coloured community, Joseph Culverwell, to the Zimbabwean senate. Nevertheless, ZANU's ascension was greeted with caution. During the bush war, black nationalists frequently decried Coloureds as having benefited unjustly from the colonial racial hierarchy, and those who attempted to join ZANU and ZAPU's guerrilla armies were often detained or executed as spies. Less educated, blue collar Coloured workers were also concerned they would face job displacement from an advancing black workforce once they lost the advantage of <b>preferential</b> <b>employment</b> by white supervisors. Others seemed convinced only blacks would benefit economically under Mugabe's rule, at the expense of themselves and other ethnic minorities. For their part, community activists were disappointed they weren't invited to participate at the Lancaster House talks on behalf of their people, and felt this demonstrated both white and black Zimbabweans were uninterested in Coloureds' future political and social welfare.|$|E
40|$|Women’s {{continued}} {{high rate}} of participation in non-standard employment, espe-cially temporary and part-time jobs, attracts much critical concern. Many social ana-lysts of work regard non-standard employment as heightening risks of economic insecurity, workplace exploitation and social marginalization. Labour economists regard temporary and part-time work as comprising ‘secondary ’ labour markets and workers in this sector as ‘secondary earners’. Many analysts consider women’s over-representation in this sector to be a consequence of women’s exclusion from pri-mary sector employment and its expected better conditions. This article develops an interpretive analysis of a qualitative study of 45 women temporary workers in New Zealand in 2001 – 2002. The experiences and aspira-tions with respect to work of this particular sample of women currently engaged in temporary employment relations indicate some divergent trajectories from those more commonly observed. In contrast to most current depictions of women and temporary employment, the findings indicate that some women are striving to practise their own <b>preferential</b> <b>employment</b> arrangements in ways that actively challenge conventional economic assumptions of employment behaviour and traditional trajectories of women’s lives. The article proposes that these efforts may indicate alternative oppositional strategies to normative acceptance of quali-tatively degraded jobs and employment relations...|$|E
40|$|Determined to {{maximize}} the gains of foreign direct investment (FDI), even more so in a low oil price world, many resource-rich countries have increasingly designed laws and policies that require foreign operators to engage indigenous companies in the procurement of goods and services, offer <b>preferential</b> <b>employment</b> for nationals; and utilize local raw materials. Other competing forces at play in establishing those practices include the investorsâ desire to ensure freedom to procure {{on the basis of}} cost, availability and quality, and the mutual desire for a transparent and efficient process. While local content requirements may specify the portion of total expenditures that must be comprised of locally sourced goods and services, procurement procedures are frequently not well established. This can (and has) led to a misalignment between governments and investors on the requirements of those procedures. This misalignment can manifest itself in material ways, resulting in significant risk to the investor. This lack of clarity and resulting misalignment in understanding and expectations can lead to distraction in investor- government communications, disruption in petroleum operations, and potentially costly formal dispute resolution with corrosive effects on the attractiveness of the investment and the host government to the international investment communities. The objective of this research is to analyze how local content and procurement requirements have evolved in the MENA region, based on a survey of 20 countries- Qatar, Algeria, Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Malta, Morocco, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen-and {{a review of the literature}} and evidence on local content and procurement provisions in petroleum agreements. The research will provide comparative analysis and regional survey of local content and procurement requirements in MENA countries, in order to determine prevailing market preferences, trends, best practices, risks and dispute mitigation strategies...|$|E
40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDThis thesis {{examines}} the trajectories of agrarian change on community-owned commercial {{farms in the}} Levubu Valley {{in the northern part}} of Limpopo Province, South Africa. Levubu is a locality where fertile land was developed and made highly productive after state-led dispossession of African communities. White farmers were initially resettled on a state-run irrigation scheme, but later became independent large-scale commercial farmers linked to global agro-food markets. The thesis focusses on four Communal Property Associations (CPAs) that acquired ownership of farms in Levubu. Government’s post-apartheid land restitution programme required the CPAs to enter into ‘strategic partnership’ agreements with agribusiness companies. Resettlement of beneficiaries on these farms was ruled out in an attempt to sustain existing production systems and levels of employment. After these partnerships collapsed, CPAs have attempted to run the farms themselves, through operating companies employing professional farm managers. Using key concepts from agrarian political economy, the thesis seeks to understand the dynamics of production and social reproduction on the farms and the political tensions that have arisen since restitution occurred. It also explores how this form of land restitution has impacted on the livelihoods of farmworkers. The study combines intensive (or qualitative) research methods, involving indepth interviews, focus groups and direct observations, and extensive (or quantitative) approaches, mainly in the form of a farmworker household survey undertaken in two communities. This research design has allowed for ‘retrospective’ analysis of changes over time to be complemented by ‘circumspective’ analysis of the relations and dynamics of property, production and power on community-owned farms in Levubu. The main findings of the study are that neither joint venture companies nor community-owned farming enterprises have been able to distribute dividend payments to claimant community members as yet. Rather, when profits have been realised they have largely been invested back into productive enterprises. Few other benefits have been received either, other than the <b>preferential</b> <b>employment</b> of some claimant farmworkers on the farms, a small number as managers or supervisors. Although additional jobs were created in the initial stages of restitution, these enterprises have struggled to maintain employment levels. Poor management decisions have meant that increased labour costs have not been accompanied by increases in productivity and output. Severe tensions and conflicts have arisen within CPAs, manifested in different forms of identity politics and competing ‘modes of belonging’. Tensions in communityowned large-scale farming enterprises are explained by the contradictory unity of capital and labour within community-owned enterprises, with difficult choices to be made between enhancing social reproduction or ensuring accumulation and profitability. These combine with complex processes of identification in socio-political struggles around access to and control of key resources. These findings suggest that policy makers should re-examine assumptions in relation to community-owned farming enterprises and explore mechanisms through which individual beneficiary households can realise more significant benefits. One policy option might be to seek the complementarity of large-scale commercial farming and smallholder farming systems, both on land restored to CPAs through restitution and in communal areas...|$|E
40|$|A large {{literature}} on African economies argues that ethnicity {{plays a role}} in the politics and economics of African countries. Unfortunately, much of this literature is speculative or anecdotal {{because of the lack of}} data, with the exception of a few papers that examine ethnic networking as a business or employment strategy. In many ways Africa 9 ̆ 2 s failure to develop is a failure of nationhood. Creating nation is handicapped by the use of ethnicity. In this paper, I empirically examine the relationship between employment, wages and ethnicity in Africa via a case study of Kenya. I challenge the pervasive view that ethnicity in Africa is related to a primordial instinct and attempt to show empirically that ethnicity is used by politicians as a political strategy to maintain power. In the process of using ethnicity, class solidarity is explicitly down played by politicians as ethnicity is reified. In this paper I specifically examine whether jobs are being used by politicians as both reward and carrot to ensure ethnic allegiances. This is done by testing whether being a member of a dominant group (in terms of population and also politically) has an impact on the possibility of employment and the level of wages. I do this using data from the 1986 Labour Force Survey which due to timing, uniquely allows me to connect ethnicity and income. I group the observation into 5 groups that are ranked based on kind of employment and wage. Of the five sectors the two desirable sectors are Self-employed above median income and Full time employment above median income. I test whether ethnicity has an impact of one being employed in these sectors. By inter-acting the dummy variable for dominant group in population and the ethnic dummy, I am able to separate out what may be returns just due to ethnic networking that comes from common culture, language etc and returns which are due in some sense to being from a politically dominant ethnicity. I am also able to test for the impact in a change in the ethnicity of the president (a further test of ethnic dominance) by using a difference in difference approach. I find that being in a politically dominant group improves one 9 ̆ 2 s chances of obtaining a full time above median wage job. In fact this improvement in chances was highly correlated with political power and a change of ethnicity of the president resulted in a decrease in the probabilities of the past presidents 9 ̆ 3 kinsfolk 9 ̆ 4 being in desired sectors. Being a member of a locally dominant group in terms of population as compared to a politically dominant national group has no effect on likelihood of employment in one of the premium categories. My findings support the view that in a highly centralized state ethnicity can be reproduced via <b>preferential</b> <b>employment</b> to members of an in-group thus diminishing class solidarity that one may expect to occur between workmates.
