5000|$|A {{system could}} be made entirely ungrounded. In this case a fault between one phase and ground would not cause any {{significant}} current. In fact, {{this is not a}} good scheme. Commonly the neutral is grounded (earthed) through a bond between the neutral bar and the earth bar. It is common on larger systems to monitor any current flowing through the neutral-to-earth link and use this as the basis for neutral fault protection. The connection between neutral and earth allows any <b>phase-to-earth</b> <b>fault</b> to develop enough current flow to [...] "trip" [...] the circuit overcurrent protection device. In some jurisdictions, calculations are required to ensure the fault loop impedance is low enough so that fault current will trip the protection (In Australia, this is referred to in AS3000:2007 Fault loop impedance calculation). This may limit the length of a branch circuit. In the case of two phases sharing one neutral, the worst-case current draw is one side has zero load and the other has full load, or when both sides have full load. The latter case results in 1 + 1@120deg = 1@60deg, i.e. the magnitude of the current in the neutral equals that of the other two wires.|$|E

Since MV and LV grid share their earthing system at the MV-LV transformer, one might question the safety with respect to LV customers {{in case of a}} <b>phase-to-earth</b> <b>fault,</b> occurring in the MV grid. Models and actual measurements in a operating grid are preformed to determine the current distribution and touch voltages. The results show that phase-to-earth faults in urban global earthed areas leads to low source voltages for touching. The models show the current distribution phenomena in a global earthed grid...|$|E

Its function would generally be changed in presence of FACTS devices. In this paper a study to investigate the direct effect of varying reactance of the TCSC on single-line-to-ground (SLG) fault in compensated distribution systems. This paper, therefore presents the calculation of fault component, and directional over-current relay operating time characteristics for <b>phase-to-earth</b> <b>fault</b> involving the TCSC. The case study is compared between compensated and uncompensated system. The coordination of the relays is a nonlinear programming problem and it is solved by using MATLAB software...|$|E

It {{is assumed that}} an area of one grid, separated from its power system, will be temporarily supplied from the other grid in its normal regime. Reference is made to {{the risks associated with}} <b>phase-to-earth</b> <b>faults</b> in grids so interconnected.

40|$|Quadrilateral {{characteristics}}. Quadrilateral characteristics provide highly suitable {{protection for}} Transmission line {{as compared to}} other characteristics. Quadrilateral relay provides flexible protection during high fault resistance of ground and phase faults. This is advantageous for protection of <b>phase-to-earth</b> <b>faults</b> on short lines, lines without earth wires, non-effectively earthed systems and feeders with extremely high tower footing resistance. This also provides fault impedance coverage for both phase to phase and phase to ground faults without effecting load encroachment. I explained factors impacting performance of Quadrilateral relay focusing on accuracy and speed of operation. In this paper Quadrilateral relay system and Bergeron model type transmission line are designed and simulated using PSCAD/EMTDC analysis software to study the different type of fault at various fault resistances. A Fast Fourier technique is used to generate apparent impedance. The simulation result shows Quadrilateral relay are highly suitable for protection of extra high voltage transmission line during resistance faults. This scheme improves the sensitivity, and reliability...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a novel approach}} to distance protection using optical fiber sensors. An optical protection system utilizing two pairs of hybrid fiber-optic voltage and current sensors is presented, allowing for distributed, multiplexed measurement of voltage and current, and hence impedance, at multiple points on a transmission network. Three separate <b>phase-to-earth</b> <b>fault</b> scenarios are tested in order to demonstrate the scheme's successful operation in laboratory conditions. The deployment of the proposed scheme in electrical power transmission and distribution systems may allow for novel and flexible protection architectures while reducing the complexity of installation and isolation requirements in the high-voltage environment {{as well as the}} elimination of the requirement for a dedicated communication media to implement multi-ended schemes. The possibility of hybrid optical/conventional techniques also exists...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} solve the fault {{location}} problem of single <b>phase-to-earth</b> <b>fault</b> in non-effectively grounded distribution network, a new fault location method based on transient frequency of zero-mode current was presented. The difference of transient frequency of zero-mode current between detecting points {{before and after the}} fault point is analyzed. This method is realized by the distribution automation (DA) system and does not require additional equipment. The zero-mode current is detected and the frequency of its transient component is calculated by the feeder terminal unit (FTU). The fault section can be located by master station according to comparing the transient frequency at different detecting point on the fault feeder. Results of digital simulation demonstrated the accuracy and feasibility of this method...|$|E
40|$|The {{reactance}} method with fault resistance separation {{has been}} developed {{in order to determine}} as precisely as possible the value of a faulty loopâ€™s impedance in transmission or distribution power system line. This method has commonly been used for impedance calculation in case of a single <b>phase-to-earth</b> <b>fault</b> in diverse power system protection applications. New developments in this area have shown that the extension of the method to multi-phase faults is not only possible but also of practical relevance. However, all previous investigations focused on impedance calculation using data from one single side of the power system line. Due to missing data from the remote end, the determined impedance value can deviate from its actual value. This research consists in an improvement of this calculation method using data from both the own and the remote line end. This approach uses communication between two measurement units e. g. protection relays, which have the advantage of not requiring a precise synchronization with each other. The additional time invariant parameters of the power system, acquired by each device and transferred to the remote end, allows an exact computation of the fault reactance as well as fault resistance. In this paper, the derivation of this novel approach as well as experimental results in a fault location application are presented. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
