5|$|Sex, Sin, and Blasphemy {{provides}} {{the reader with}} a history of censorship of artworks. The book argues that artists have been scapegoated by those advocating censorship, as a method of diverting debate away from the suppression of human rights. The author asserts that censorship of works deemed obscene {{has been used as a}} tactic throughout history to suppress women's rights. Heins describes for the reader the history of the 1873 Comstock laws. It's stated that,"such laws were put forth by United States <b>Postal</b> <b>Inspection</b> Service inspector Anthony Comstock, and after he helped influence passage of the legislation, they enabled the government to criminalize sending perceived immoral writings through the mail".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the effects upon management control in schools following {{the assumption of}} responsibility for delegated budgets required by the Education Reform Act (ERA) 1988. The paper {{examines the}} process of construction, approval and amendment of school budgets drawing on a neo-institutionalist framework. Our investigation has drawn upon extensive interviews in 17 schools in three North West local authorities, supplemented by a <b>postal</b> questionnaire and <b>inspection</b> of relevant documents. We develop two main arguments. First, {{in order to satisfy}} their statutory duties LEAs supervised the introduction of internal systems of budgetary control and school development planning in schools. Thus, control procedures were largely designed by internal auditors, who sought to provide an audit trail and to ensure financial probity mainly to satisfy external legitimacy, rather than to influence internal decision-making. Second, the specific nature of the relationship between budgeting and strategy varies between schools as the extent of formalised planning differs, but in general there is a very loose coupling between strategic objectives and budget expenditures...|$|R

25|$|Meehan {{became the}} United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on September 17, 2001, {{six days after}} the September 11, 2001 attacks. He was {{appointed}} by President George W. Bush and confirmed by the United States Senate. Meehan headed an office of over 200 lawyers and staff backed up by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the U.S. <b>Postal</b> <b>Inspection</b> Service Office. As U.S. Attorney, Meehan made terrorism, gang-related crime, child internet safety, and public corruption priorities for his criminal division.

500|$|The initial 1978 {{bombing was}} {{followed}} by bombs sent to airline officials, and in 1979, a bomb {{was placed in the}} cargo hold of American Airlines Flight 444, a Boeing 727 flying from Chicago to Washington, D.C. A faulty timing mechanism prevented the bomb from exploding, but it released smoke which forced an emergency landing. Authorities said it had enough power to [...] "obliterate the plane" [...] had it exploded. As bombing an airliner is a federal crime, the Federal Bureau of Investigation became involved in the case, designating it UNABOM, for UNiversity and Airline BOMber. (U.S. Postal Inspectors, who initially had the case, labeled the suspect the [...] "Junkyard Bomber" [...] because of the material used to make the mail bombs.) In 1979, an FBI-led task force that included the ATF and U.S. <b>Postal</b> <b>Inspection</b> Service was formed. The task force grew to more than 150 full-time personnel, but minute analysis of recovered components of the bombs, and investigation of the lives of victims, proved of little use in identifying the suspect, who built his bombs primarily from scrap materials available almost anywhere. The victims, investigators later learned, were chosen irregularly from library research.|$|E

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to England, where actions against obscene literature were the preserve of the magistrates, in America such actions were {{the responsibility of}} the <b>Postal</b> <b>Inspection</b> Service, embodied in the federal and state Comstock laws, named after the postal officer and anti-obscenity crusader Anthony Comstock who proved himself officious in the work of suppression both in his official capacity and through his New York Society for the Suppression of Vice. [...] The first such law was the Comstock Act, (ch. 258 [...] enacted March 3, 1873) which made it illegal to send any [...] "obscene, lewd, and/or lascivious" [...] materials through the mail. Twenty-four states passed similar prohibitions on materials distributed within the states.|$|E
2500|$|The Thompson {{first entered}} {{production}} as the M1921. It {{was available to}} civilians, although poor sales resulted from {{the expense of the}} weapon: the Thompson gun, with one Type XX 20 shot [...] "stick" [...] magazine, was priced at $200.00 in 1921 (...) [...] M1921 Thompsons were sold in small quantities to the United States <b>Postal</b> <b>Inspection</b> Service (to protect the mail from a spate of robberies) and to the United States Marine Corps. Federal sales were followed by sales to several police departments in the US and minor international sales to various armies and constabulary forces, chiefly in Central and South America. The Marines used their Thompsons in the Banana Wars and in China. It was popular with the Marines as a point-defense weapon for countering ambush by Nicaraguan guerrillas, and led to the organization of four-man fire teams with as much firepower as a nine-man rifle squad. The major complaints against the Thompson were its weight, inaccuracy at ranges over , and the lack of penetrating power of the [...]45 ACP pistol cartridge.|$|E
2500|$|The defendant, Jeffrey Grubbs, {{became the}} subject of an {{undercover}} federal investigation and prosecution when he ordered a videotape containing child pornography from a website operated by an undercover U.S. postal inspector. The <b>Postal</b> <b>Inspection</b> Service then arranged a controlled delivery of the tape to Grubbs. An application was submitted to a magistrate judge for the Eastern District of California requesting an [...] "anticipatory" [...] search warrant, so-called because it is based upon the probable cause that at some time in the future (but not at present) certain evidence of a crime will be located at a specified place). An affidavit accompanying the warrant application stated as the [...] "triggering condition" [...] that the search warrant would not be executed until the tape had been delivered and taken into Grubbs' home. However, this condition was omitted from the issued warrant. Two days later, the undercover delivery occurred and Grubbs' house was searched after the tape was taken inside. The videotape and other items were seized, and Grubbs was arrested.|$|E

The United States <b>Postal</b> <b>Inspection</b> Service and the Pornography Unit of the Los Angeles Police Department's Organized Crime and Vice Division had conducted the investigation leading to the indictment. On September 5, 2002 a U.S. postal inspector had joined the Extreme website. Postal inspectors then viewed clips on the site, and ordered three videotapes which were sent to a postal agent in Pittsburgh. On August 6, 2003 Black, Borden and the company were indicted by {{a federal grand jury}} in Pittsburgh on ten counts of the production and distribution by mail and the Internet of obscene pornographic materials. Zicari and Romano faced a maximum total sentence of fifty years in prison, a fine of $2,500,000, or both.

2500|$|With a {{reported}} {{one third of}} the currency in circulation being counterfeit at the time, the Secret Service was created on July 5, 1865 in Washington, D.C., to suppress counterfeit currency. Chief William P. Wood was sworn in by Secretary of the Treasury Hugh McCulloch. It was commissioned in Washington, D.C. as the [...] "Secret Service Division" [...] of the Department of the Treasury with the mission of suppressing counterfeiting. The legislation creating the agency was on Abraham Lincoln's desk the night he was assassinated. At the time, the only other federal law enforcement agencies were the United States Park Police, the U.S. Post Office Department's Office of Instructions and Mail Depredations (now known as the United States <b>Postal</b> <b>Inspection</b> Service), and the U.S. Marshals Service. The Marshals did not have the manpower to investigate all crime under federal jurisdiction, so the Secret Service began to investigate everything from murder to bank robbery to illegal gambling. After the assassination of President William McKinley in 1901, Congress informally requested that the Secret Service provide presidential protection. A year later, the Secret Service assumed full-time responsibility for presidential protection. In 1902, William Craig became the first Secret Service agent to die while serving, in a road accident while riding in the presidential carriage.|$|E
