To verify the long-term reliability {{and performance of}} the VCD Urine Processor Assembly (UPA), life testing was performed at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) from January 1993 to April 1996. Two UPA'S, the VCD- 5 and VCD- 5 A, were tested for 204 days and 665 days, respectively.

40|$|The {{objective}} of groundwater sampling for site characterisation is {{the collection of}} samples that represent the underlying conditions at a site and ensuring that sample integrity is maintained from field to laboratory. The authors describe the tools available to the field sampler for the collection of groundwater samples, methods of on-site water quality analysis and the appropriate preservation and handling of samples. There {{are a variety of}} portable sampling devices available for the collection of groundwater, however, each application has different requirements and is dependant on the contaminant(s) of interest and most importantly, the specification of the borehole to be sampled. A number of different sampling devices and their applicability are presented. Traditionally, to ensure sample representivity the removal of stagnant water from a monitoring well was accomplished by purging a fixed number of well volumes, generally between three to five volumes, prior to sample collection. In recent years research has shown that low-flow <b>purging</b> (<b>pumping</b> at a rate that doesn’t disturb the stagnant water in a well) produces samples that are representative of the formation water. In addition ‘no purge’ sampling is becoming an increasingly accepted method of collecting representative groundwater samples for some determinands, in particular VOCs and some metals using diffusion methods. The merits of different purge methodologies are discussed. On-site water quality measurements are carried out predominantly to monitor effective purging of water at the sampling point before sample collection, and to measure unstable parameters that cannot be subsequently reliably determined in the laboratory. On-site measurements such as pH, Specific Electrical Conductance (SEC), Oxidation Reduction Potential (ORP), Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Temperature and alkalinity can be used to provide a check on a subsequent laboratory analysis. Techniques for the preservation and analysis of samples and quality assurance and quality control are also presented...|$|R
40|$|In November 1984 {{the first}} large {{absorption}} heat pump (AHP) in Sweden was installed. The AHP delivers 7 MV heat to a district heating system, using excess steam as drive energy and cooling water as heat source. The steam and the cooling water originate from a near by chemical plant as waste energy. The heat pump is manufactured by SANYO. It {{is one of the}} largest AHP (type I) in the world so far. The generator is heated with 10 bar steam and in the evaporator, water is cooled from 60 °C to 30 °C. The heat pump raises the temperature of the district heating water from 60 °C to 80 °C. The working pair used is Lithium bromide-water. A single control loop reduces the steam flow when the temperature of the district heating water exceeds 83 °C. In this paper the energy balances and internal behavior of the heat pump are presented. The energy balances were continuously determined from temperature and flow recordings every other minute in the external streams of the AHP. The internal behavior - such as heat transfer - have been studied by means of surface temperature sensors. The COP was found to vary between 1. 3 and 1. 8 with a mean value of 1. 6. Since startup the availability has been 100 %. The AHP is very flexible with load variations between 0 % and 100 % without complications.

40|$|By {{studying}} the Orbital Express mission, modeling the spacecraft and scenarios, and testing the system, a technique {{has been developed}} that uses recursive decomposition to represent procedural actions declaratively, schema-level uncertainty reasoning to make uncertainty reasoning tractable, and lightweight, natural language processing to automatically parse procedures to produce declarative models. Schema-level uncertainty reasoning has, at its core, the basic assumption that certain variables are uncertain, but not independent. Once any are known, then the others become known. This is important where a variable is uncertain for an action and many actions of the same type exist in the plan. For example, {{if the number of}} retries to <b>purge</b> <b>pump</b> lines was unknown (but bounded), and each attempt required a sub-plan, then, once the correct number of attempts required for a purge was known, it would likely be the same for all subsequent purges. This greatly reduces the space of plans that needs to be searched to ensure that all executions are feasible. To accommodate changing scenario procedures, each is ingested into a tabular format in temporal order, and a simple natural-language parser is used to read each step and to derive the impact of that step on memory, power, and communications. Then an ASPEN (Activity Scheduling and Planning Environment) model is produced based on this analysis. The model is tested and further changed by hand, if necessary, to reflect the actual procedure. This results in a great savings of time used for modeling procedures. Many processes that need to be modeled in ASPEN (a declarative system) are, in fact, procedural. ASPEN includes the ability to model activities in a hierarchical fashion, but this representation breaks down if there is a practically unbounded number of sub-activities and decomposition topologies. However, if recursive decomposition is allowed, HTN-like encodings are enabled to represent most procedural phenomena. For example, if a switch requires a variable (but known {{at the time of the}} attempt) number of attempts to switch on, one can recurse on the number of remaining switch attempts and decompose into either the same switching activity with one less required attempt, or not decompose at all (or decompose into a dummy task), resulting in the end of the decomposition. In fact, any bounded procedural behavior can be modeled using recursive decompositions assuming that the variables impinging the disjunctive decomposition decision are computable at the time that the decision is made. This enables one to represent tasks that are controlled outside of the scheduler, but that the scheduler must accommodate, without requiring one to give a declarative model of the procedural behavior...|$|E

Design charts and equations (or correction factors) are presented. Simple analytical flow and transport models are also developed. These simple models are found to be efficient and economical to use in the design of landfills; and, they give comparable results with sophisticated numerical models.;The 2 ̆ 2 ratio method 2 ̆ 2 used in the interpretation of pumping tests to evaluate the bulk vertical hydraulic conductivity of an aquitard has some limitations (or errors). To overcome these limitations, the response of a piezometer (installed in an aquitard) to a pumping test in an adjacent aquifer has been studied using a finite-element technique based on Biot theory. Anisotropy of the hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard is also considered. Correction factors are presented to correct the errors due to time lag and the length effect associated with the simple piezometers used in pumping tests. The effects of the borehole diameter and the presence of a sand pack are also studied.;Design charts and equations are developed to design the layout of leachate extraction (<b>purge,</b> <b>pump)</b> wells which may be used, as a backup to the leachate collection system, to control leachate mounding in landfills, if there has been a failure of the leachate collection system or if there is no leachate collection system. Anisotropy of the hydraulic conductivity of the waste, the leakage through the liner and the plugging of wellbore are considered. Correction factors are presented to account for the plugging of the wellbore. The effects of having a higher leachate level in the well are also investigated.;Simple analytical flow models are developed for two-layer and multi-layer aquitard-aquifer systems. To solve the equations and the iterative procedure involved in these models, two computer programs are developed. These flow models are considered suitable for sensitivity studies to assist in the preliminary design of landfills, initial calibration of hydrogeological models and to prepare velocity input for transport models. The interactions between the engineered system and the natural hydrogeological system of landfills are studied using these models. The potential for 2 ̆ 2 shadow effect 2 ̆ 2 is also examined for two hypothetical landfills.;The application of simple transport models, such as POLLUTE, in modelling landfills which are engineered with drainage layers is verified. An approximate method is developed to model non-uniform flow field using POLLUTE. The use of POLLUTE to model transient flow is also examined.

30|$|A {{total of}} 23 {{groundwater}} samples, namely, monitoring, domestic and hand dug wells from five districts were sampled. The sampling campaign {{was carried out}} in the dry season, in the months of October and November, 2013. In sampling from boreholes with hand <b>pumps,</b> <b>purging</b> was done for a minimum of 10  min to flush stagnant water retained in the pipes. In the case of hand dug wells, it was properly checked and confirmed that the well was being used daily. This was to ensure that stale and stagnant water was not sampled. All the water samples were collected in 250  mL preconditioned high-density polyethylene bottles. The bottles were conditioned by washing with 5  % nitric acid, and then rinsed several times with distilled water. This was carried out to ensure that the sampling bottles were free from contaminants. Temperature, electrical conductivity (EC) and total dissolved solids (TDS) measurements were conducted in situ in the field by the HACH conductivity and pH meter. On-site testing of these variables was necessary since these parameters are likely to change during transport. Bicarbonate (HCO 3 −) titration was done at the well head using a HACH digital titrator. Sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) were analysed using flame emission photometer (Sherwood model 420), magnesium (Mg 2 +) and calcium (Ca 2 +) using Varian AA 240 Fast Sequential Atomic Absorption Spectrometer.

The samples for anions were only filtered but not acidified. All water samples were correctly labeled, kept air-tight to prevent evaporation and kept in a refrigerator (except those for isotopic studies) until analyses were carried out. All water analyses were carried out at the chemistry laboratory of the Ghana Atomic Energy Commission (GAEC), Kwabenya.

40|$|Spectral Library: The Berlin Emissivity Database (BED) is a {{spectral}} library {{containing the}} emissivity measurements of several planetary analogues. It contains currently entries for plagioclase and potassium feldspars, low Ca and high Ca pyroxenes, olivines, elemental sulphur, common martian analogues (JSC Mars- 1, Salten Skov, palagonites, montmorillonite, hematite, goethite) and a lunar highland soil sample {{measured in the}} wavelength range from 3 to 50 µm {{as a function of}} particle size. For each sample, the spectra of four well defined particle size separates (< 25 µm, 25 - 63 µm, 63 - 125 µm, 125 - 250 µm) are measured with a 4 cm- 1 spectral resolution. These size separates have been selected as typical representations for most of the planetary surfaces [1]. Laboratory set-up: The instrumentation is located in the Planetary Emissivity Laboratory (PEL) at the Institute for Planetary Research (PF) of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Berlin, Germany. It consists of a spectrometer attached to an external emissivity device. The Bruker VERTEX 80 v spectrometer, has a very high spectral resolution (better then 0. 2 cm- 1), and a resolving power of better than 300, 000 : 1, and can be operated under vacuum conditions. To cover the entire 1 to 50 µm spectral range, two detectors, a liquid nitrogen cooled MTC and a room temperature DTGS and two beamsplitter, a KBr and a Multilayer are used to measure the same target. The emissivity device is composed of the sample chamber, a double-walled box with three apertures: a 15 cm squared door used to insert the cup in the box, a 5 cm rounded opening through which the beam is directed to the spectrometer and a 5 cm opening facing the attached blackbody unit. A heater is placed in the chamber and is used to heat the cup with samples from the bottom. The thermal radiation emitted normal to the surface by the sample or the blackbody is collected by an Aucoated parabolic off-axis mirror and reflected to the entrance port of the spectrometer. Figure 1 shows the emissivity device attached to the spectrometer external port: the sample chamber is opened to show the parabolic mirror mounted on a mechanical arm and oriented toward the reference blackbody, the sample heater and the <b>purging</b> system. A <b>pump</b> circulates water at a constant temperature in the volume between the inner and outer walls of the chamber. The surfaces of the box are painted with black high emissivity paint. The chamber is purged with dry air to remove particulates, water vapour and CO 2. Further details can be found in [2, 3]. Emissivity spectra: In Figure 2 an example of quartz measurements for two extreme grain sizes is shown, together with analogue measurements extracted from the ASU and ASTER spectral libraries. Complementary to the existing datasets (ASU and ASTER), the BED library sensibly extend both the investigated spectral range and the grain size ranges. The enormous difference between the spectra of the small and large fractions witness the need for such a complete dataset for a correct interpretation of remote sensing data. Martian analogues: The emission spectra of standard martian analogue materials like the JSC Mars- 1 (a palagonitic tephra from Hawaii, USA), the Salten Skov (a Fe-oxide precipitate from the Midjutland region of Denmark), montmorillonite, hematite, goethite and some palagonites from Hawaii, USA, are shown and discussed in this paper.

40|$|Introduction: The Institute for Planetary Re-search has an {{expertise}} in spectroscopy of minerals, rocks, meteorites, and organic matter, {{build up in}} more than two decades. The available equipment allows spectroscopy from the visible to TIR range using bi-conical reflection and emission spectroscopy. The in-stitute has an outstanding heritage in designing and building infrared remote-sensing instruments for planetary missions. The heart of the spectroscopic facilities is the Planetary Emissivity Laboratory (PEL) which has been completely refurbished in the last two years. The PEL allows now to measure the emissivity of planetary ana-logue materials from 3 - 50 μm for very fine grained samples. We will report here on the next development step of the PEL which is the addition of a planetary simula-tion chamber. This chamber will allow to measure samples under vacuum and at temperatures up to 500 °C. After this upgrade the PEL will be the first lab that can routinely measure the emissivity of fine grained samples from 1 to 50 μm over an extremely wide range of temperatures. The PEL: The PEL has been operating in various configurations for the last 10 years. The laboratory experimental facilities consist of the main emissivity spectrometer laboratory, a supporting spectrometer laboratory for reflectance measurements, sample preparation facilities and an extensive collection of rocks and minerals. The emissivity spectrometer laboratory has been upgraded in 2006 with a new Bruker VERTEX 80 V FTIR spectrometer. This spectrometer has a very high spectral resolution (better then 0. 2 cm- 1), and a resolv-ing power of better than 300, 000 : 1, and can be oper-ated under vacuum conditions to remove atmospheric features from the spectra. To cover the entire from 1 to 50 μm spectral range, two detectors, a liquid nitrogen cooled MTC (1 - 16 μm) and a room temperature DTGS (15 - 50 μm). two beamsplitter, a KBr and a Multilayer, and two entrance windows, KBr and CsI are used to measure the same target. The spectrometer is coupled to an emissivity cham-ber which has been developed at DLR. It is a double-walled box with three apertures: a 15 cm squared door used to insert the cup in the box, a 5 cm rounded open-ing through which the beam is directed to the spec-trometer and a 5 cm opening facing the attached black-body unit. A heater is placed in the chamber and is used to heat the cup with samples from the bottom. The thermal radiation emitted normal to the surface by the sample or the blackbody is collected by an Au-coated parabolic off-axis mirror and reflected to the entrance port of the spectrometer. Figure 2 shows the emissivity device attached to the spectrometer external port: the cover of the sample chamber is removed to show the parabolic mirror mounted on a mechanical arm and oriented toward the reference blackbody, the sample heater and the <b>purging</b> system. A <b>pump</b> circulates water at a constant temperature in the volume between the inner and outer walls of the chamber. The surfaces of the box are painted with black high emissivity paint. The chamber is purged with dry air to remove particulates, water vapour and CO 2. Further details can be found in [1, 2]. The PEL is with this setup since late summer 2007 in routine operation. In Figure 2 an example of quartz measurements for two extreme grain sizes is shown, together with analogue measurements extracted from the ASU and ASTER spectral libraries. Complemen-tary to the existing datasets (ASU and ASTER), the BED library sensibly extend both the investigated spectral range and the grain size ranges. The enormous difference between the spectra of the small and large fractions witness the need for such a complete dataset for a correct interpretation of remote sensing data. The Berlin Emissivity Database (BED) : One of the main tasks of the PEL is the creation of the Berlin Emissivity Database (BED) - a spectral library con-taining the emissivity measurements of several plane-tary analogues. It contains currently entries for more than 25 minerals including plagioclase and potassium feldspars, low Ca and high Ca pyroxenes, olivine, elemental sulphur, common martian analogues (JSC Mars- 1, Salten Skov, palagonites, montmorillonite) and a lunar highland soil sample all measured in the wavelength range from 3 to 50 μm as a function of particle size. For each sample, the spectra of four well defined particle size separates (< 25 μm, 25 - 63 μm, 63 - 125 μm, 125 - 250 μm) are measured with a 4 cm- 1 spectral resolution. These size separates have been selected as typical representations for most of the planetary surfaces [3]. The next step: For 2008 a major upgrade of the PEL is planned. A planetary simulation chamber will be replace the currently used chamber for most meas-urements. This chamber can be evacuated so that the complete optical path from the sample to the detector is free of any influence by atmospheric gases. The chamber will have an automatic sample transport sys-tem which allows to maintain the vacuum while chang-ing the samples. The main highlight however will be the new heating system. It will allow to heat the samples to tempera-tures of up to 700 K allowing measurements under real-istic conditions for the surface of Mercury. Further-more the heating system will allow to force thermal gradients in the samples which is a much more realistic representation of the thermal conditions on planetary surface. Summary: The PEL can provide the planetary community already today with emissivity measure-ments highly complementary to exisiting spectral data-bases. With the 2008 upgrade the PEL will allow unique measurements with a strong focus on airless bodies and extreme conditions as for example BepiColombo and MESSENGER will encounter at Mercury. This will be especially benefical for MERTIS the thermal infrared imaging spectrometer on BepiCo-lombo [1, 2, 4]. The PEL will routinely obtain emissivity measurements over the extremely wide spectral range from 1 - 50 μm for fine grained samples. The measurements at 1 μm will for example allow {{for the first time a}} direct interpretation of the surface observa-tions obtained by VIRTIS on VenusExpress through the atmospheric windows.
