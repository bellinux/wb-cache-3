25|$|The largest part of {{traditional}} Faroese food consists of meat. Because of the rugged, rocky Faroese terrain, grain and vegetables do not grow very well, as only about 2% of the 1,393km2 is arable land and none is {{set aside for}} <b>permanent</b> <b>crops.</b> Globally, less than 3% of the earth's surface is suitable for crop production (for food and clothing purposes). During the winter months, the Faroe Islanders’ only option was to eat mostly salted or dried food (this includes sheep meat, pilot whale meat, seabirds, and fish).

Industries largely consist of manufacturing of forestry, agriculture, husbandry, chemistry, textile and mining products. There are 81 active industrial plants in the province, most of them located at the central district of Erzurum, and are small and medium enterprises. Due to their relatively small sizes, these industries mainly serve local markets causing lower capacity usage, low productivity and unemployment. About 40 plants are currently out of use, mostly due to high operating costs.|$|E

25|$|Syria {{is located}} in Southwestern Asia, north of the Arabian Peninsula, at {{the eastern end of}} the Mediterranean Sea.

50|$|Oxisols {{are often}} used for {{tropical}} crops such as cocoa and rubber. In some cases, rice is grown on them. <b>Permanent</b> <b>cropping</b> of oxisols in low-income areas is very difficult because of low cation exchange capacities and high phosphorus fixation on iron and aluminium oxides (ligand exchange mechanism; inner sphere complex with phosphate). However, many oxisols can be cultivated {{over a wide range}} of moisture conditions. On this account, oxisols are intensively exploited for agriculture in some regions which have enough wealth to support modern agricultural practices (including regular additions of lime and fertilizer). A recent example of exploitation by modern methods involves the growing of soybeans in Brazil.|$|R

40|$|European rural landscapes are {{currently}} {{going through a}} process of degradation. In some regions, degradation arises via the intensification and industrialization of agricultural practices. On others, it results from the extensification of farming or even from its abandonment. This process, which leads to environmental and cultural loss, has been raising concerns about the preservation of European rural landscapes. But, while some conservation measures have already been enacted, the preservation of European rural landscapes faces several problems. One of the main difficulties results from the lack of knowledge about the process of landscape change, as this knowledge is fundamental to control landscape evolution. Within this context, this work brings some knowledge about the evolution of rural landscapes in Interior Alentejo, a region located in southern Portugal. Interior Alentejo is currently going {{through a process of}} landscape degradation via the extensification and abandonment of farming practices. The main rural landscapes identified in the region are: forest, montado, <b>permanent</b> <b>crop</b> landscapes, and open fields. Under <b>permanent</b> <b>crop</b> landscapes are classified orchards, olive groves, vineyards, mixed farming areas and tree coplanted fields. This dissertation describes the historic evolution of Interior Alentejo rural landscape from pre-history to present times. This study reveals the emergence of each landscape type and their main changes throughout history. At the same time, it allows the identification of the main anthropogenic factors of landscape change, and corresponding rules of action. To evaluate the effect of the interaction between anthropogenic factors and the main ecological factor varying in the region (soil fertility), the landscape evolution in counties with low and high soil fertility has been studied separately. Cultural heritage, political stability, the market, policies, social structure, population density, and technology have been the main anthropogenic factors of landscape change in Interior Alentejo. Knowledge about their rules of action, i. e., about their effect on the landscape, might be used to predict landscape changes and to control the process of landscape evolution...|$|R

Livestock is a major source of cash income for upland villagers in northern Laos. Most households raise a few local-breed pigs in low-input, low productivity systems. Pigs are often free-ranging and subsist by scavenging with supplementary feeding based on household food waste, collected greens, and rice bran. Pigs are often kept for two to three years before they reach marketable weight. Undernourished pigs are prone to disease and significant losses occur even when adequate vet-erinary services are available. Improving the productivity of village pig systems could provide income for rice purchase and capital for diversification to more sustainable livelihood systems...|$|R
