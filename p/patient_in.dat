40|$|Purpose:. This study {{evaluates the}} role of {{liposomal}} bupivacaine in implant-based breast reconstruction. Methods:. A prospective, randomized, single-blind trial of liposomal bupivacaine in implant-based breast reconstruction was performed. <b>Patients</b> <b>in</b> the control arm were treated with 20 [*]mL 0. 25 % bupivacaine with epinephrine 1 : 200, 000 to each breast pocket. <b>Patients</b> <b>in</b> the experimental arm were treated with 10 [*]mL 1. 3 % liposomal bupivacaine delivered to each breast pocket. Pain scores were recorded {{over the course of}} patients’ hospital stay. Consumption of pain medications, benzodiazepines, and anti-emetics was monitored. Length of stay and other direct cost data were collected. Results:. Twenty-four patients were enrolled, with 12 women randomized to each arm. Average postoperative pain scores were 3. 66 for <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> the control arm and 3. 68 for <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> the experimental arm. Opioid consumption was 1. 43 morphine equivalent dosing/h for <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> the control arm and 0. 76 morphine equivalent dosing/h for <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> the experimental arm (P = 0. 017). Diazepam consumption was 0. 348 [*]mg/h for <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> the control arm and 0. 176 [*]mg/h for <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> the experimental arm (P = 0. 011). Average length of hospital stay was 46. 7 hours for <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> the control arm and 29. 8 hours for <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> the experimental arm (P = 0. 035). Average hospital charges were $ 18, 632 for <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> the control arm and $ 10, 828 for <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> the experimental arm (P = 0. 039). Conclusions:. Liposomal bupivacaine reduces opioid and benzodiazepine consumption, length of stay, and hospital charges.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Patients</b> <b>in</b> a {{minimally}} conscious state (MCS) show restricted self or environment awareness but {{are unable}} to communicate consistently and reliably. Therefore, better understanding of cerebral noxious processing <b>in</b> these <b>patients</b> is of clinical, therapeutic, and ethical relevance. METHODS: We studied brain activation induced by bilateral electrical stimulation of the median nerve <b>in</b> five <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> MCS (aged 18 - 74 years) compared with 15 controls (19 - 64 years) and 15 patients (19 - 75 years) in a persistent vegetative state (PVS) with (15) O-radiolabelled water PET. By way of psychophysiological interaction analysis, we also investigated the functional connectivity of the primary somatosensory cortex (S 1) <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> and controls. <b>Patients</b> <b>in</b> MCS were scanned 57 (SD 33) days after admission, and <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> PVS 36 (9) days after admission. Stimulation intensities were 8. 6 (SD 6. 7) mA <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> MCS, 7. 4 (5. 9) mA in controls, and 14. 2 (8. 7) mA <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> PVS. Significant results were thresholded at p values of less than 0. 05 and corrected for multiple comparisons. FINDINGS: <b>In</b> <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> MCS and in controls, noxious stimulation activated the thalamus, S 1, and the secondary somatosensory or insular, frontoparietal, and anterior cingulate cortices (known as the pain matrix). No area was less activated <b>in</b> the <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> MCS than in the controls. All areas of the cortical pain matrix showed greater activation <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> MCS than in those in PVS. Finally, <b>in</b> contrast with <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> PVS, those in MCS had preserved functional connectivity between S 1 and a widespread cortical network that includes the frontoparietal associative cortices. INTERPRETATION: Cerebral correlates of pain processing are found in a similar network <b>in</b> controls and <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> MCS but are much more widespread than <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> PVS. These findings might be objective evidence of a potential pain perception capacity <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> MCS, which supports the idea that these patients need analgesic treatment.

In this study, the results of determination of S 100 protein, LDH, MIA and tyrosinase in the serum of 50 patients with MM (stages I-IV) were determined. The increased values of MIA were found <b>in</b> 26 % <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> stage I, while <b>in</b> 50 % <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> stage IV.

5|$|As {{many of the}} {{clinical}} {{signs and symptoms of}} ethylene glycol poisoning are nonspecific and occur in many poisonings the diagnosis is often difficult. It is most reliably diagnosed by the measurement of the blood ethylene glycol concentration. Ethylene glycol in biological fluids can be determined by gas chromatography. Many hospital laboratories do not have the ability to perform this blood test {{and in the absence of}} this test the diagnosis must be made based on {{the clinical}} presentation of the <b>patient.</b> <b>In</b> this situation a helpful test to diagnose poisoning is the measurement of the osmolal gap. The patients' serum osmolality is measured by freezing point depression and then compared with the predicted osmolality based on the patients' measured sodium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, and any ethanol that may have been ingested. The presence of a large osmolal gap supports a diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning. However, a normal osmolar gap does not rule out ethylene glycol exposure because of wide individual variability.|$|E

5|$|Greenlandic verbs inflect for {{agreement}} with agent and patient, for mood and for voice.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Dabigatran, {{which is}} {{administered}} in a fixed dose {{and does not}} require laboratory monitoring, may be suitable for extended treatment of venous thromboembolism. METHODS: In two double-blind, randomized trials, we compared dabigatran at a dose of 150 mg twice daily with warfarin (active-control study) or with placebo (placebo-control study) <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> with venous thromboembolism who had completed at least 3 initial months of therapy. RESULTS: In the active-control study, recurrent venous thromboembolism occurred in 26 of 1430 <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> the dabigatran group (1. 8 %) and 18 of 1426 <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> the warfarin group (1. 3 %) (hazard ratio with dabigatran, 1. 44; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 78 to 2. 64; P= 0. 01 for noninferiority).
