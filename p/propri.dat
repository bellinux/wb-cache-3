40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of frozen soils {{are described in}} terms of creep, relaxation and strength. Equations are presented which describe the behaviour of each property authenticated by laboratory and field work. The main part of the work is on the thermal deformation of laboratory prepared frozen soils, followed by treatment of the thermal stresses in undisturbed frozen soil. Patterns of thermal deformation were determined experimentally. The shape of the curves indicates that stabilization of thermal deformations occur slowly even after the temperature of the specimen becomes constant. The thermo-rheological processes in frozen soils are best described if the soil is regarded as a visco-elastic model of the Bingham-Shvedov type. Deformation consists of two parts, elastic and visco- plastic. The peculiar mechanism of thermal deformations and stresses during freezing of the active layer can be compared to shrinkage during hardening of metal alloys. The difficulty in establishing relationships is that the dynamics of the temperature field in a freezing layer is so extremely complex. The moisture content of the active layer after freezing is at a maximum at the surface and decreases until it is at a minimum {{at the bottom of the}} active layer. Because of this variation the dynamics of thermal stresses also change with depth. In most cases the stresses at depths about 2 / 3 down the active layer in the first half of the cold period must be tensile stresses. At the same time compression stresses may occur in the upper layers. Fissures may develop at depth without showing at the surface.

40|$|Polymeric {{materials}} have considerably lower thermal stability than metals; most are flammable, {{but they can}} be formulated to be fire-resistant. They are good electrical insulators, have much lower modulus than metals, but higher strength-to-weight ratio; and exhibit viscoelastic behaviour, implying time dependence. In contrast with metals, polymeric materials exhibit creep effect, even at room temperature. According to their stress-strain behaviour, they can be divided into four classes: hard and brittle, hard and strong, hard and tough, and soft and tough. Polymers and plastics are generally resistant to alkalis, acids, and water but most are affected by certain organic solvents. Their outdoor weathering resistance varies from excellent to poor but most commercial plastics can now be compounded to show fairly good weathering performance. Chemical, electrical, and physical properties (including mechanical properties) depend on the nature and amount of the various compounding ingredients.

40|$|Abstract: As {{the largest}} lymphoid organ {{and the largest}} {{reservoir}} of macrophages in the body, the gastrointestinal tract mucosa is probably the largest organ reservoir ofmacrophages infected with HIV- 1. To elucidate the biology of HIV- 1 infection ofintestinal macrophages, we isolated lamina propria macrophages from normal human jejunum by neutral protease digestion, purified the cells by counterfiow centrifugal elutriation, and then infected the cells with WV-i. The lamina propria macrophages were permissive to macrophagetropic isolates of HIV- 1 and substantially less perinissive to lymphocyte-tropic isolates. Compared with blood monocytes, mucosal macrophages produced 2 - 3 logs less p 24 antigen at peak infection. The reduced level of infection was not due to impaired macrophage viability, reduced CD 4 expression, or the isolation procedure. These results confirm that macrophages isolated from the gastrointestinal tract mucosa can support HIV- 1 production, albeit at a lower level than blood monocytes.

40|$|To achieve {{successful}} and durable bituminous waterproof membranes the designer {{must consider the}} properties and behaviour of both bitumen and reinforcement, the nature and behaviour of the surface {{to which it is}} applied, and the conditions of exposure or properties of the environment in which it must serve. The composite membrane has certain desirable properties, but is subject to several mechanisms of deterioration that can be allowed for or guarded against by design. The protection or shading of a membrane from solar radiation (CBD 65) has great value in extending its life, as does provision for drainage and the avoidance of trapped moisture. In some cases the occurrence of membrane failure can be prevented by a planned program of periodic maintenance. The manner of installation and quality of workmanship, however, are of fundamental importance to the performance of bituminous membranes.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that entrepreneurs who start incorporated firms are fundamentally different from entrepreneurs who start sole proprietorships. This difference suggests that incorporation status may distinguish the self-employed with no ambition to hire from entrepreneurs who plan to hire others. In this paper, we show that this intuition is correct. Using a dataset with over 24 million observations and more than 230, 000 entries into entrepreneurship, we show that newly incorporated entrepreneurs create 50 % more jobs than sole proprietors. The result derives from the fact that high-ability individuals are more likely to form incorporated ventures. While there is selection from both tails of the ability distribution into starting incorporated ventures - that is, both stars and misfits start corporations - it is primarily individuals with low ability, the misfits, who start sole proprietorships. This does not, however, mean that the aggregate number of jobs created by the incorporated is higher.

Eosinophils were isolated from the intestinal lamina propria of rats and purified to nearly 90 % purity by a combination of velocity sedimentation through Percoli and unit gravity sedimentation through a continuous gradient of bovine serum albumin. Isolated eosinophils were of high viability and responded to surface receptor stimulation. Freshly isolated intestinal eosinophils lacked cytotoxic capacity when incubated with newborn larvae in the presence of specific antiserum. Peritoneal eosinophils from the same rats exhibited 100 % helminthotoxicity after 24 h. Cytotoxicity could be stimulated in the intestinal eosinophils by the addition of recombinant murine interleukin- 5.

40|$|A {{hallmark}} of pathogenic simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) infections is the rapid and near-complete depletion of mucosal CD 4 T lymphocytes from the gastrointestinal tract. Loss of these cells and dis-ruption of epithelial barrier function are associated with microbial translocation, which has been proposed to drive chronic sys-temic immune activation and disease progression. Here, we evaluate in rhesus macaques a novel attenuated variant of patho-genic SIVmac 239, termedGY, which contains a deletion of a Tyr and a proximal Gly from a highly conserved YxxØ trafficking motif in the envelope cytoplasmic tail. Compared to SIVmac 239,GY established a comparable acute peak of viremia but only transiently infected lamina propria and caused little or no acute depletion of mucosal CD 4 T cells and no detectable microbial translocation. Nonetheless, these animals developed T-cell activation and declining peripheral blood CD 4 T cells and ulti-mately progressed with clinical or pathological features of AIDS. GY-infected animals also showed no infection of macro-phages or central nervous system tissues even in late-stage disease. Although theGYmutation persisted, novel mutations evolved, including the formation of new YxxØmotifs in two of four animals. These findings indicate that disruption of this traf-ficking motif by theGYmutation leads to a striking alteration in anatomic distribution of virus with sparing of lamina <b>propri...</b>|$|E

40|$|Morphogens {{regulate}} {{epithelial cell}} fate {{decisions in the}} adult gastrointestinal tract. The authors hypothesized that influx of inflammatory cells into the lamina propria may disturb the normal expression gradients of morphogens (morphogenetic landscape) in gastrointestinal epithelia. Changes in {{the activity of the}} bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway in normal and Helicobacter pylori-infected gastric mucosa were therefore examined. It is shown that BMP receptors, the activated (phosphorylated) form of the intracellular BMP signal transduction protein SMAD 1, and BMP target ID 2 all localize to gastric epithelial cells that are {{at the end of the}} axis of epithelial renewal in normal mucosa. Colonization of human gastric mucosa with H. pylori was associated with an increase in BMP 2 expression due to influx of inflammatory cells that produce BMP 2. Furthermore, whereas no BMP 4 was detected in the normal antrum, focal infiltrates of BMP 4 -expressing cells were found in the H. pylori-infected stomach. This influx of BMP-expressing cells was associated with an increase in epithelial BMP signalling. Interestingly, a shift in activity of the BMP pathway was observed towards the precursor cell compartment (isthmus) of the gastric units. Thus, H. pylori infection results in an influx of inflammatory cells that disturb the normal activity gradient of a morphogenetic pathway with an established role in epithelial cell fate regulation. The data suggest that morphological changes in epithelial histology may result from alterations in the morphogenetic landscape secondary to changes in the cellular composition of the lamina <b>propri...</b>|$|E

Four and 5 years after skidding, rut depths averaged 15 cm below the original soil surface; mean fine-soil bulk density (0 - 30 cm depth) below ruts of nontilled trails exceeded that on logged-only portions by 14 %. Height growth on nontilled trails averaged 24 % less than on logged-only portions in year 4 after planting and decreased to 6 % less in year 7. For years 8 - 10, mean height growth was similar for all treatments. Reduced height growth lasted for about 7 years compared with 2 years for coastal Washington. Ten years after planting, trees in skid-trail ruts averaged 10 % shorter with 29 % less volume than those on logged-only portions.

40|$|One terrain {{feature of}} great {{significance}} to the extent, thickness and thermal regime of permafrost is vegetation. Its thermal properties {{determine the amount of}} heat leaving or entering the underlying ground. Vegetation has an indirect effect on climate, which influences permafrost. Treeless vegetation such as lichen and mosses may have a different albedo. Net radiation is also an important factor. Direct measurement of the convection component is extremely difficult and it may be evaluated as the difference between the sum of the other measurements and the total. Bowen's ratio is also sometimes used. Evaporation, including evapotranspiration, withdraws heat from the surrounding atmosphere and from incident solar radiation. Vegetation draws water by transpiration thus depleting the soil of heat held by that water. There are great variations between species. Vegetative cover of dead material has a large insulating effect on the underlying permafrost. Depth of thaw increases where vegetation cover has been removed. The micro climate resulting from vegetation is probably most effective by influencing the wind speed. The density of the vegetation and height of tree cover influences are well known. Ground that permits the greatest degree of water penetration usually thaws to the greatest depths. The low thermal conductivity of snow and its double role as inhibitor of frost penetration during winter and soil thawing in the spring has been noted.

The most easily observed and measured characteristic of permafrost is the depth of thaw and variations in types of vegetation are often readily noticeable.

40|$|In many {{tests of}} ice-structure {{interactions}} performed using physical modeling techniques, the ice can fail in bending, flexure or by tensile cracking. Because of this, {{it is necessary}} to know and understand the flexural and fracture toughness properties of the model ice used in the test {{in order to be able}} to better interpret the results. In spite of this, to date there has been only a limited number of tests to measure the flexural behavior and the parameters influencing the flexural response of the model ice. The fracture toughness of model ice has not been measured. In this paper, the flexural behavior and fracture toughness of both freshwater ice and sea ice are reviewed in order to establish the prototype values and behavior which must be scaled for the model test. The results of a series of tests on the flexural properties of the model ice are presented and discussed in terms of the parameters which influence the strength including warmup time and temperature, test type (cantilever or simple beam), loading rate and loading direction. The fracture toughness of the model ice has been measured and the results are presented and compared to the prototype values for freshwater ice and sea ice. A comparison is made to assess the accuracy of the scalability of these properties of the ice.

40|$|Il {{principale}} obiettivo della ricerca consiste nell’esaminare la strategia di comunicazione economico-finanziaria delle PI sui mercati esteri, al fine di verificare se il processo di internazionalizzazione si configura come fattore determinante nell’indurre l’impresa ad arricchire, in senso sia qualitativo che quantitativo, il flusso informativo destinato ai <b>propri</b> stakeholder. Dai risultati dell’ indagine svolta emerge che nonostante sia possibile rilevare una correlazione positiva tra il grado di internazionalizzazione e la produzione di flussi informativi a sostegno dell’attività di export, il processo di internazionalizzazione produce ancora effetti limitati sullo scambio di informazioni di natura economico-finanziaria tra le imprese. Internationalisation, both as {{an answer}} to environmental changes and as a strength of competitive positioning, is a fundamental aim for the developing of the Italian system, independently from firms dimensions. In fact, it is confirmed by empirical evidences that small businesses are increasingly concerned with international competition. Undoubtedly this process requires small firms and small entrepreneurs to own new attitudes, new relationship competencies and professional know-how in order to manage their growth in a international context. Accounting {{is the language of}} business. As a consequence we think that Small Business aiming to grow in foreigner markets, should learn technical skills for drawing up financial statements in a effective way. This in order to improve their communication process with foreign stakeholders (as client and suppliers, value chain partners, investors and others). Since, our research attempts to: -	evaluate which information is currently offered by these small firms that operate in international markets (both information compulsory and voluntarily given to users); -	suggest some improvements, according to a normative view, in order to increase the usefulness of small businesses financial statements. The survey covers 135 small firms. Our main findings suggest that: -	the way of internationalisation followed by small business of our sample is conforming with models suggested by literature; -	many small entrepreneurs do not use their company financial accounts and annual reports as support tools to communicate with their stakeholders, both national and foreign ones. This is consistent with our previous researches and with literature. As a consequence of this, we suggest that the financial statements of small business have to increase their usefulness both for stakeholders and for the management of these firms...|$|E
40|$|L’articolo è stato ispirato dall’ultimo lavoro di Lorna Simpson, artista che vive e lavora a Brooklyn. Nei suoi lavori fotografici Simpson affronta il tema dell’identità afroamericana, esplorando e mettendo in discussione le questioni di genere, razza e cultura. Nella sua mostra dal titolo “Gathered” all’Elizabeth A. Sackle Center for Feminist Art presso il Brooklyn Museum di New York nel 2011, Simpson ha realizzato due installazioni di ritratti fotografici di donne di colore. Nella prima installazione Simpson ha esibito una serie di ritratti di sconosciute donne di colore realizzati tramite cabina per fototessere, acquistati su eBay e collezionati dall’artista. La seconda, May June July August 1957 / 2009 (2009), è costituita da una serie di scatti vintage in bianco e nero di una giovane donna afroamericana, in pose da pin-up: tra essi, l’artista ha inserito i <b>propri</b> ritratti, interpretando le stesse pose della modella sconosciuta. Collegando i ricordi personali ad una ricostruzione immaginaria del passato, le opere in mostra a Brooklyn segnalano una nuova direzione dell’indagine di Simpson sulla memoria, sulla verità e sulla finzione. The {{article is}} {{inspired}} by the latest work of Lorna Simpson, a Brooklyn-based artist. In her photoworks Simpson deals with the African American identity, exploring and challenging issues of gender, race and culture. In her show entitled “ Gathered ” and displayed at the Elisabeth A. Sackle Center for Feminist Art in the Brooklyn Museum of New York in 2011, Simpson realizes two installations of black females photographic portraits. In the first installation Simpson exhibit a series of photo-booth portraits of unknown black women, bought on e-Bay and collected by the artist. The second one, May June July August 1957 / 2009 (2009), is made up {{by a series of}} black and white vintage snapshots of a young African American woman, posing for pinups: among them, the artist inserts her own portraits, acting the same poses of the unknown model. Linking personal memories with a fictionalized reconstruction of the past, the work exhibited in Brooklyn points a new direction of Simpson ’ s investigation on memory, truth and fiction. </p...|$|E
40|$|La volontà dei vertici del Comune di Firenze di aprire i <b>propri</b> dati alla cittadinanza in linea con le recenti iniziative OpenData ha creato la necessità di mettere in piedi una infrastruttura dedicata che andasse da un lato incontro alle esigenze del pubblico ma che dall’altro lato si andasse ad integrare in modo semplice e trasparente con la infrastruttura esistente del SIT. La decisione di basarsi interamente su {{software}} Open Source per i nuovi componenti ha creato ulteriori incognite su questa nuova implementazione. Scopo di questo articolo è descrivere non solo i componenti utilizzati ed il lavoro di integrazione svolto, ma anche le linee guida e le policy seguite durante la vita del progetto che sono risultate fondamentali per la sua buona riuscita. The township of Florence {{has been}} {{the first one in}} Italy to fully adhere to the OpenData initiative by releasing many of its own data through open and permissive licenses with the objective of increasing transparency of its procedure as well as to boost awareness and participation from the citizenship; last but not least the goal of supporting and encouraging developers’ creativity with creating innovative applications exploiting all the newly available data was also an important driver especially in these times of harsh economic conditions. The decision makers of the Florence SIT office, responsible for the creation of the infrastructure for supporting the OpenData initiative, have decided to enhance the existing, consolidated infrastructure using only Open Source software and therefore they decide to hire renowned GeoSpatial Open Source experts from the GeoSolutions Italian company to help them with the design and implementation as well as to ensure the presence of competent commercial support for the chosen solutions and to receive the necessary training on the job to guarantee the sustainability of the infrastructure in the long term. This article firstly introduce the existing situation at the time the design of the new infrastructure was started as well as the initial objectives. Afterwards we introduce and dissect the work performed to actually implement the changes to the infrastructure, providing detailed information on the building blocks employed {{as well as on the}} policies followed. Eventually, we introduce the next steps to be implemented for the infrastructure. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we have studied Si {{clusters}} with point defects in various charged states. Point defects in semiconductors affects the electronic {{structure of the}} material introducing new energy levels and consequently new modes of transport. Detailed study of the point defects have been undertaken in various approaches. The most common practice is to usesuper-cell calculations under the framework of Density Functional Theory with Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC). Inthis formalism {{there are a lot}} of factors like defect-defect interactions, image charge interactions, that are to be correctedfor to achieve the " artefact-free" results. In this study we have used Free Boundary Conditions with nano-clusters of Sipassivated with Hydrogen at the surface. Previous works have undertaken in detail the geometrical effects in the nanoclusters. But a complete picture of the electrostatics and its effect on the energy states demand a complete study. Hence inour calculations we take another approach, devoid of the correction factors for cases with PBC, and produce an alternativeway to calculate the formation energy of the defects. We have described the formation and stability of the defects invarious charged states and provided with a detailed analysis of the properties pertaining to the nano-scale size. Finallymigration parameters are provided with respect to the charge states of the defects. Our results are also compared with thePBC calculations with critical discussions. Ce travail aborde le sujet des d efauts charg es dans le silicium. Jusqu' a pr esent, les d efauts charg es ont principalement et e etudi es en conditions p eriodiques (PBC). En e et, l'approche PBC est parfaite pour simuler unsolide in ni. Mais, comme je le montre dans ce chapitre, elle apporte aussi des artefacts. En particulier dans le traitement de l' electrostatique, o u des traitements math ematiques important doivent ^etre utilis es pour supprimer les interactions non d esir ees entre r epliques. Notre approche vise a simuler correctement un d efaut charg e, tout en conservant de bonne <b>propri</b> et es pourle mat eriau massif. Elle consiste a simuler le d efaut dans un nano-agr egat.
