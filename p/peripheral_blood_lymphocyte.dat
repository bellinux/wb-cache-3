5000|$|Many other immunomodulating {{factors have}} been isolated, the most {{important}} of which are prostaglandins and cytokines. PGE2 was the first immunomodulator to be derived from macrophages and described. PGE2 functions in amplifiying <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> IL-10 transcription and protein production; as well as in deactivating macrophages and T-cells. PGE2 is an immunomodulatory eicosanoid derived from the cell membrane component, arachidonic acid, and is processed in the arachidonic acid cascade: the successive oxygenation and isomerization of arachidonic acid by cyclooxygenase and PGE2 synthase enzymes. [...] The regulation of target cells by PGE2 occurs via signaling through four cell membrane-associated G-protein-coupled E-prostanoid (EP) receptors, named EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4. PGE2 inhibits bacterial killing and ROI production by AM by impairing Fcγ-mediated phagocytosis through its ability to stimulate the production of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) effectors via EP2 and EP4 receptors signaling. EP2 and EP4 receptors signal primarily through stimulatory G protein (Gs), increasing adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity and subsequent cAMP formation. cAMP is a second messenger that influences multiple cellular functions via the activation of two downstream effector molecules, protein kinase A (PKA) and the exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (Epac-1 and -2). Epac-1 and PKA are both important factors involved in the inhibition of AM bacterial killing. The effects of PKA results from its ability to phosophorylate serine and threonine residues on many cellular proteins, especially transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). cAMP/PKA/CREB axis mediates the inhibition of TNF-alpha release. [...] The killing of phagocytosed bacteria by AMs is dependent upon several distinct microbicidal mechanisms, like the reduced NADPH oxidase-mediated release of ROI. ROI generation by NADPH oxidase is an important bactericidal mechanism after FcR-mediated phagocytosis. PGE2 activates both Gs-coupled EP2 and EP4 receptors by ligation, stimulating cAMP production and subsequent activation of downstream cAMP effectors, PKA and Epac-1; both which in turn impair the phosphorylation and phagosomal membrane translocation of NADPH oxidase component, p47phox, thereby inhibiting the respiratory burst.|$|E

METHODS: Alpha 1 -adrenergic receptors were quantified by radioligand binding assays, employing [3 H]-prazosin as the radioligand in association with compounds displaying different degrees of selectivity for alpha 1 A-, alpha 1 B- and alpha 1 D-adrenergic receptor subtypes. RESULTS: The affinity of [3 H]-prazosin binding was similar in <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> of different stage essential hypertensive and normotensive subjects or of SHR and age-matched normotensive WKY rats {{as well as in the}} aortas of SHR and WKY rats. The radioligand binding assay revealed no change in the {{expression of}} alpha 1 -adrenergic receptors in <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> of essential hypertensives compared with normotensive subjects; a moderate decrease of alpha 1 B-adrenergic receptors and an increase of alpha 1 D-adrenergic receptors. The relative densities of the alpha 1 -adrenergic receptor subtypes were similar in the three groups of essential hypertensives. In <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> and in aorta of SHR, [3 H]-prazosin binding was significantly reduced compared with normotensive WKY rats. The expression of alpha 1 -adrenergic receptor subtypes in <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> of SHR was similar to that found in <b>peripheral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> of essential hypertensives. CONCLUSIONS: Changes of lymphocyte alpha 1 -adrenergic receptor subtypes in essential hypertensives are similar to those observed in lymphocytes and vascular tissues of animal models of hypertension.
