For vehicles whose duty cycle is dominated by start-stop operation, fuel consumption may be significantly improved by better management of the start-stop process. <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>hybrid</b> technology represents one technology pathway to realise this goal. Vehicle kinetic energy is converted to pneumatic energy by compressing air into air tank(s) during the braking.

In order to support the investigation of energy management, system architecture and control methodologies, two kinds of simulation models are created.

The simulations were carried out using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The results showed that the exhaust-gas recycling efficiency and the merger flow energy are significantly dependent on the optimal adjustments of A and CSA for the change in Pair.

40|$|Many complex {{technologies}} {{have been developed}} and applied to improve the energy efficiency and exhaust emission of an engine under different driving conditions. The overall thermal efficiency of an internal-combustion engine, however, can be maintained at only about 20 - 30 %, with aggravated problems {{in the design and}} development, such as overall difficulty, excessive time consumption or excessively high cost. For electric cars, there is still no major technological breakthrough for the rapid recharging of a large capacity battery and detection of remaining power in it. Although all currently available hybrid-power engines are able to lower the amount of exhaust emissions and the fuel consumption of the engine, they are still unable to achieve a stable and optimal running condition immediately after ignition; hence the engine's thermal-efficiency remains low. To solve the aforementioned problems, an innovative concept - a <b>hybrid</b> <b>pneumatic</b> power-system (HPPS), which stores "flow work" instead of storing electrochemical energy of the battery - is introduced. This innovative power system not only ensures that the internal-combustion ensures optimally but also recycles the exhaust flow to propel the vehicle.

During deceleration, the energy previously used {{to accelerate the}} vehicle is mainly wasted on heat generated by the friction brakes. If this energy that is wasted in traditional IC engines could be saved, the fuel economy would improve. Today there are several solutions {{to meet the demand}} for better fuel economy {{and one of them is}} the pneumatic hybrids. The idea with pneumatic hybridization is to reduce the fuel consumption by taking advantage of the, otherwise lost, brake energy. In the work presented in this study a heavy duty Scania D 12 engine has been converted to work as a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>hybrid.</b> During <b>pneumatic</b> <b>hybrid</b> operation the engine can be used as a 2 ‐stroke compressor for generation of compressed air during vehicle deceleration (compressor mode) and during vehicle acceleration the engine can be operated as an air‐motor driven by the previously stored pressurized air (air‐motor mode).

One of the engine inlet valves has been modified to work as a tank valve in order to control the pressurized air flow to and from the pressure tank. In order to switch between different modes of engine operation there is a need for a fully variable valve actuation (FVVA) system.

The analysis was performed on four different parallel hybrid powertrain concepts: Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV), High Speed Flywheel Hybrid Vehicle (HSF-HV), Hydraulic Hybrid Vehicle (HHV) and <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>Hybrid</b> Vehicle (PHV). In order to perform equitable analysis of different hybrid systems, comparison was performed also on the basis of the same usable system energy storage capacity (i. e. 625 kJ for HEV, HSF and the HHV) but in the case of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>hybrid</b> systems maximal storage capacity was limited by the size of the systems in order to comply with the packaging requirements of the vehicle.

This constant-pressure model in its original form provides good results in most cases, but this paper shows that it does not converge for low valve opening and pressure ratio values, for which the characteristic lines become vertical. A solution to this problem cannot be found in the literature. The current paper presents a new MOC-based valve boundary condition that obviates convergence problems. The computational time of the proposed model is evaluated and compared with that of Benson's model.

Among the others, Electric (HEV) and Mechanical (HSF-HV) parallel Hybrid configurations are examined throughout this Thesis. To fully exploit the HVs potential, an optimal choice of the hybrid components to be installed must be properly designed, while an effective Supervisory Control must be adopted to coordinate the way the different power sources are managed and how they interact. Real-time controllers can be derived starting from the obtained optimal benchmark results.

40|$|Vehicle {{suspension}} {{design and}} dynamics analysis {{play a key}} role in enhancement of automotive system performance. Despite extensive developments in actively-controlled suspensions, their commercial applications have been limited due to the associated high cost and weight. Alternative designs in either passive or semi-active suspensions are highly desirable to achieve competitive vehicle performance with relatively lower cost and greater reliability. This dissertation research proposes two hydro-pneumatic suspension strut designs, including a twin-gas-chamber strut, and systematically investigates various concepts in roll- and pitch-coupled suspensions employing hydraulic, <b>pneumatic</b> and <b>hybrid</b> fluidic interconnections between the wheel struts. The proposed strut designs, including single- and twin-gas-chamber struts, offer larger working area and thus lower operating pressure, and integrate damping valves. Nonlinear mathematical models of the strut forces due to various interconnected and unconnected suspension configurations are formulated incorporating fluid compressibility, floating piston dynamics, and variable symmetric and asymmetric damping valves, which clearly show the feedback damping effects of the interconnections between different wheel struts. The properties and dynamic responses of the proposed concepts in roll- and pitch-coupled suspension struts are evaluated in conjunction with in-plane and three-dimensional nonlinear vehicle models. The validity of the vehicle models is demonstrated by comparing their responses with the available measured data. The analyses of the proposed coupled suspensions are performed to derive their bounce-mode, anti-roll, anti-pitch and warp-mode properties, and vehicle dynamic responses to external excitations. These include road roughness, steering and braking, and crosswinds. The results suggest that the fluidically-coupled passive suspension could yield considerable benefits in enhancing vehicle ride and handing performance. Furthermore these offer superior design flexibility. The suspension struts offer a large number of coupling possibilities in the three-dimensions, some of which however would not be feasible, particularly for commercial vehicles where suspension loads may vary considerably. A generalized analytical model for a range of interconnected suspensions is thus developed, and a performance criterion is formulated to assess the feasibility of a particular interconnection in a highly efficient manner. The handling and directional responses of a three-dimensional vehicle model employing X-coupled hydro-pneumatic suspension are evaluated under split-o straight-line braking and braking-in-a-turn maneuvers. The results clearly show that the X-coupled suspension offers enhanced anti-roll and anti-pitch properties while retaining the soft vertical ride and warp properties. Fundamental pitch and vertical dynamics of a road vehicle are also considered to derive a set of essential design rules for suspension design and tuning for realizing desirable pitch performanc...|$|R

Its total production cost {{is very high}} not only due to inherent cost of fuel but also due to transportation and maintenance costs. Moreover, the use of fossil fuels is {{a significant source of}} greenhouse gas emissions. Hybrid systems that combine wind turbines and diesel generators reduce fuel consumption, operational cost and pollution. Adding a storage element to this hybrid system increases the penetration level of renewable sources, i. e. the percentage of renewable energy in the overall production, and further improves fuel savings. Among all energy storage techniques, CAES (compressed air energy storage) has several advantages to be combined with hybrid WDS (wind-diesel systems), due to its low cost, high power density and reliability.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{energy management}} strategies {{for a new}} <b>hybrid</b> <b>pneumatic</b> engine concept which is specific by its configuration {{in that it is}} not the vehicle but only the engine itself which is hybridized. Different energy management strategies are proposed in this paper. The first is called Causal Strategy (CS) and implements a rule-based control technique. The second strategy, called Constant Penalty Coefficient (CPC), is based on the minimization of equivalent consumption, where the use of each energy source is formulated in a comparative unit. The balance between the consumption of different energy sources (chemical or pneumatic) is achieved by the introduction of an equivalence factor. The third strategy is called Variable Penalty Coefficient (VPC). In fact, it is beneficial to consider the equivalence coefficient as variable within the amount of pneumatic energy stored in the air-tank i. e. state of charge, because the choice of propulsion mode should be different if the tank is full or empty. In this case, the penalty coefficient appears as a non linear function of the air-tank state of charge. Another way to adapt the penalty coefficient is to recognize a reference pattern during the driving cycle. The coefficient value can then be changed according to an optimized value found for each of the reference cycles. This strategy is called Driving Pattern Recognition (DPR). It involves a technique of sliding window pattern recognition. The concept is to convert the whole driving cycle into smaller pieces to which the equivalence factor can be appropriately adapted. This strategy is based on the assumption that the current driving situation does not change rapidly and thus the pattern is likely to continue into the near future. The identification window size is a parameter which has to be adjusted to attain the maximum of identification success over the reference cycle. We propose to define reference patterns as statistical models. The pattern recognition method is based on a correlation function. To improve analysis, all the results obtained with different energy management strategies are compared with a Dynamic Programming approach (DP) considered as the optimal solution. Results show that about 40 % of fuel saving can be achieved by DP. The VPC and DPR strategies give better results than the CPC strategy, not so far from the results obtained with DP...|$|R
