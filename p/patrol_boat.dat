5|$|Once the commandos {{finally got}} out of the tunnel, they both swam towards the {{broadside}} of Card which anchored near the opening of the sewer. As planned, Nao and Hung attached two bombs on the ship, with one near the bilge and one at the engine compartment, just above the water surface. After the bombs had been attached to Cards hull, Nao inspected both bombs to ensure they had been assembled properly. After that Nao stuck the battery onto a pole and connected it to the bombs with wires, then set the timer. At 1.10am, the bombs were completed and both commandos retreated back into the sewer tunnel, and climbed into their canoes {{on the other side and}} rowed back to Thu Thiem. Again, the police <b>patrol</b> <b>boat</b> was waiting for Nao and Hung to arrive, because the commander wanted another bribe. As Nao and Hung approached the <b>patrol</b> <b>boat,</b> an explosion was heard and a bright light could be seen in the commercial port area. The South Vietnamese police <b>patrol</b> <b>boat</b> than started its engine and raced towards Card, instead of extracting another bribe.|$|E

Five members of Cardiffs crew were used to man a captured Argentine <b>patrol</b> <b>boat,</b> renamed , in Stanley. Cardiff {{spent the rest of}} June acting as the Landing Area Air Warfare Controller (LAAWC) around San Carlos.|$|E
5|$|The {{need to keep}} {{information}} secret {{may also}} {{have contributed to the}} delays and the defenders' scepticism. As the auxiliary <b>patrol</b> <b>boat</b> crews, the indicator loop staff, and other personnel manning defensive positions would have been outside 'need to know' and would not have been informed about any of the incidents prior to the attack, they would not have been alert, contributing to the disbelief demonstrated {{in the early hours of}} the attack.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, the Australian and New Zealand Governments, at {{the request}} of Pacific Island nations, sent defence representatives into the South-West Pacific region to assess {{surveillance}} and maritime patrol requirements. The governments of a number of the Pacific nations expressed their concern about the need for a suitable naval patrol force to meet their new surveillance requirements. The Australian government responded by creating the Defence Cooperation Project (DCP), to provide suitable patrol vessels, training and infrastructure to island nations in the region. The Pacific <b>Patrol</b> <b>Boat</b> Systems Program Office was created within the Minor War Vessels Branch of the RAN procurement organisation.|$|E

5|$|During {{the evening}} of 22 August, a force of eight Fireflies and six bomb-armed Hellcats from Indefatigable raided Kaafjord again. This {{was the first in}} what was {{intended}} to be a series of small harassing attacks conducted to wear down the German defences. German forces did not detect the aircraft before they arrived over Kaafjord at 7:10 pm, and the Fireflies' strafing attacks on German gun positions killed one member of Tirpitzs crew and wounded ten. However, the Hellcats' bombs failed to inflict any damage on the battleship. The British fighters also attacked German ships and radar stations on their return flight, damaging two tankers, a supply ship and a <b>patrol</b> <b>boat.</b> No British aircraft were lost during this raid.|$|E
5|$|No {{body parts}} were {{recovered}} by the Soviet search {{team from the}} surface of the sea in their territorial waters, though they would later turn over clothes and shoes to a joint U.S.–Japanese delegation to Nevelsk on Sakhalin.

The two new <b>patrol</b> <b>boats</b> arrived from China in June 2010, and were commissioned as the Jaco-class on the eleventh of the month. In November 2010 it was reported that East Timor would order a further two <b>patrol</b> <b>boats</b> from South Korea. In the event, three ex-Republic of Korea Navy Chamsuri class <b>patrol</b> <b>boats</b> were donated, and these entered service with the naval component on 26 September 2011. The East Timorese government also ordered two fast <b>patrol</b> <b>boats</b> from the Indonesian company PT Pal in March 2011 for the price of $US40million.|$|R
5|$|On 18 March 1940, Alster was requisitioned by the Kriegsmarine. She {{was used}} as a supply ship in Operation Weserübung - the German {{invasion}} of Norway, forming part of the invasion's , transporting heavy equipment. Alster departed Brunsbüttel at 02:00 on 3 April, destined for the North Norwegian port of Narvik. She was one of four supply ships sailing from the Schleswig-Holstein port in support of German forces landing at Narvik on 9 April, under cover of sailing to Murmansk in the Soviet Union. None of these ships made it to their destination. The lack of supplies and artillery would leave the German forces fighting at Narvik vulnerable. Upon reaching Norwegian waters, Alster and the tanker Kattegat, also bound for Narvik, were escorted by the Norwegian torpedo boat HNoMS Trygg as far as Kopervik, where they arrived on 5 April. At Kopervik the German plans suffered a delay {{because of a lack of}} pilots to guide the ships northwards, Alster continuing later that day, while Kattegat departed Kopervik only on 6 April. Many of the other supply ships sent out in advance of the invasion also suffered delays, putting the supply part of the invasion plans out of schedule. While at Kopervik, Alster and Kattegat were inspected by the torpedo boat , the Norwegians finding nothing irregular. By 8 April, Alster had reached Vestfjorden, where she was hailed by the Norwegian <b>patrol</b> <b>boat</b> , which warned her of the British naval minefield laid in the area earlier that day. Alster steamed to Bodø, to await developments. Two days later, on 10 April, following the outbreak of war between Norway and Germany the previous day, Syrian was despatched by Norwegian authorities to seize Alster off Bodø. When Syrian found Alster, the commander of the small Norwegian <b>patrol</b> <b>boat</b> chose not to board the German vessel as he suspected she was armed and possibly carrying troops. As Alster attempted to escape, Syrian sent out messages to the British warships in the area.|$|E

Under this program the ADF provides assistance with training, infrastructure, equipment and logistics and participates in joint exercises with countries in South East Asia and Oceania. The Pacific <b>Patrol</b> <b>Boat</b> Program {{is the largest}} Defence Cooperation Program activity and supports 22 Pacific class patrol boats operated by twelve South Pacific countries. Other important activities include supporting {{the development of the}} Timor Leste Defence Force and Papua New Guinea Defence Force and supplying watercraft to the Armed Forces of the Philippines. Australia also directly contributes to the defence of Pacific countries by periodically deploying warships and aircraft to patrol their territorial waters; this includes an annual deployment of RAAF AP-3 Orions to the region as part of a multi-national maritime surveillance operation. Under an informal agreement Australia is responsible for the defence of Nauru.|$|E
5|$|The Austro-Hungarian base at Zemun {{was briefly}} {{evacuated}} {{due to a}} Serbian counterattack in September. On 28 September, Körös, along with the monitor , a <b>patrol</b> <b>boat</b> and a minesweeper, broke through the minefields on the Sava near Belgrade and pushed upstream to join the fighting near Šabac. In November, French artillery support arrived in Belgrade, endangering the monitor's anchorage. The stalemate continued until December 1914 when the Serbs briefly evacuated Belgrade {{in the face of}} an Austro-Hungarian assault, although Körös did not support this action. After less than two weeks, the Austro-Hungarians had to withdraw from Belgrade, and it was soon recaptured by the Serbs with Russian and French assistance. Körös continued in action against Serbia and her allies at Belgrade until December, when the base of the Danube Flotilla was withdrawn north to Petrovaradin for the winter.|$|E
