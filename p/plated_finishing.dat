50|$|Nevertheless, River Plate joined {{dissident}} Uruguayan Football Federation in 1923 that organised its own {{tournament in}} 1923. River <b>Plate</b> <b>finished</b> 26th., being relegated with other 16 teams. That {{would be the}} last appearance of the club in the top division of Uruguay. By 1925 River Plate F.C. had been disestablished.|$|R
50|$|Hood {{ornaments}} {{are usually}} cast in brass, zinc, or bronze and finished in a chrome <b>plated</b> <b>finish.</b> During {{the years when}} chrome plate was unavailable, they were plated in either silver or nickel. Some also incorporated other materials, such as plastic, bakelite, or colored glass, while others incorporated a light bulb for illumination at night.|$|R
50|$|The {{surface texture}} is either plate or vellum. <b>Plate</b> <b>finish</b> is {{as smooth as}} glass, and is very good for pen and ink. Vellum (or kid) finish is a medium texture more {{appropriate}} to friction-based media, such as crayon, chalks, or charcoal. A third finish, engravers or wedding, {{may be used for}} formal engraved wedding invitations.|$|R

In the late 1930s, Barclay {{set up a}} small company to {{reproduce}} jewelry and fabricate utilitarian figures for ashtrays, bookends, desk sets, lamps, and other articles for home and office use. These products were fabricated out of cast grey metal with a thick bronze <b>plate</b> <b>finish</b> and they retailed {{for just a few}} dollars. The company, which he named the McClelland Barclay Arts Products Corporation, made him little money.|$|R

This new, limited edition trim level comes equipped with the new 210 hp gen3 turbo four, new front fascia and a metal dash <b>plate</b> <b>finished</b> off with 'R' badging all around. Along with increased performance, the new engine is expected to get about 8% greater fuel economy, or around 1-2 more miles per gallon. The engine will be fitted to all Volkswagens that currently use the gen2 2.0l turbo four.|$|R
50|$|As {{early as}} 1985, Lebrun {{began to use}} the {{computer}} {{as a means to}} streamline and modernize production. Originally, he employed the conventional tools and materials used by earlier Blondie artists: steel pen points (originally Gillot 1290s, later Hunt 103 or 104s for the line work and filed-down Speedball A-2s for lettering), Strathmore two-ply <b>plate</b> <b>finish</b> paper and Pelikan drawing ink. By January 2002, Lebrun made the strip's production fully digital, abandoning paper, pencil and ink in favor of the PowerPC G4.|$|R

50|$|Watts {{was born}} in 1894 in Toronto. On May 22, 1915, at Woodbine Racetrack, Watts rode Tartarean to victory for the King's <b>Plate,</b> <b>finishing</b> in 2:09.20. Watts' brother, Richard, was also a {{professional}} thoroughbred jockey. After a successful career as a jockey, Watts retired from the sport, and became a butcher. He married Myrtle E McEwan, and together they had three children. The family owned a longstanding butcher shop in Toronto's East York until Watts' death in 1940, in Toronto. He is buried in Toronto's historic St John Norway's Church Cemetery.|$|R
5000|$|In 1919 Racing {{moved to}} the {{dissident}} league [...] "Asociación Amateurs de Football", winning the tournament whilst remaining unbeaten again. Racing played 23 fixtures, winning its 7th. consecutive title with 26 points, 43 goals scored. River <b>Plate</b> <b>finished</b> the extraordinary sequence of Racing's 7 titles, when winning the 1920 championship. Racing was the runner-up only 2 points to River. Racing remained in the Asociación Amateurs league, where the team won the 1921 title after playing 38 matches and totalizing 66 points. Racing also scored 73 goals receiving 16.|$|R

50|$|After 20 {{years since}} the last time it had been used, the average system for relegations {{returned}} in the 1983 Metropolitano championship, two years after San Lorenzo was relegated. That year, River <b>Plate</b> <b>finished</b> 18° out of 19 teams and would have been relegated under the old system, along with Racing de Córdoba. The first teams to be relegated on average were Racing and Nueva Chicago. Boca Juniors was also struggling at that time and had a dismal 1984 season. These facts have led to speculation that the averaging system was instituted to minimize the chance of big teams being relegated.|$|R
50|$|Powder {{metallurgy}} (PM) {{components are}} sealed prior to plating {{and to reduce}} internal corrosion. Plating operations typically involve submerging the parts in acid solutions. After plating, residual acid internal to the part can promote corrosion and/or preclude an acceptable <b>plating</b> <b>finish.</b> The {{solution to this problem}} is to seal the internal voids prior to plating. As explained above, the porosity is saturated with monomer and is then rinsed completely clear of the surface. The resin cures to a durable polymer. Thus, the exposed surface metal is free to be plated while the interior spaces are sealed dry.|$|R

5000|$|After winning each {{of their}} home legs, Peñarol and River Plate {{required}} a playoff to break the deadlock. The match was played in the Estadio Nacional of Santiago, Chile. River <b>Plate</b> <b>finished</b> the first half 2-0 and was in cruise control towards its first title. The manyas managed to revert the disadvantage to push this match into extra time. With two more goals, the final score of 2-4 meant that Peñarol became the first three-time winners of the competition. The collapse of River Plate {{in the second half}} led the club to being known, even now, as the [...] "gallinas".|$|R

Processing {{equipment}} for the waterless plate is unique to this system, using specialized chemical and mechanical treatment of the <b>plate.</b> The <b>finished</b> <b>plate</b> now has a non-image area composed of ink repellent silicone. In the image area, the silicone has been removed to expose the ink receptive photopolymer material. This design allows the plate to selectively attract and resist ink {{without the use of}} any water, etches or alcohol.|$|R

Their {{ability to do}} so is dependent, among other things, on the ability of the Au deposit to inhibit the grain boundary diffusion and subsequent surface oxidation of Ni. In this study, the relation between functional performance, Ni diffusionr ate, and Au microstructure was examined. Extent of Ni diffusion during heating was determined by Auger electron spectroscopy for several electrolytic and electroless Ni/Au finishing processes. Results were correlated with differences in Au microstructures determined by SEM, atomic force microscopy, and XRD...|$|R
50|$|Carlos Ischia was {{appointed}} as coach after Russo's departure. Under his coaching the club won the 2008 Recopa Sudamericana (against Arsenal de Sarandí). On the other hand, Boca was eliminated by Fluminense (which {{would be the}} runner up) in the 2008 Copa Libertadores semi-finals. At {{the end of that}} year Boca obtained a new title, the 2008 Apertura. That season ended with Boca, San Lorenzo and Tigre in equal 1st position so a play-off tournament had to be contested among those 3 teams in order to proclaim a new champion. Boca won that tournament and became new Argentine champion. That same season Boca's arch-rival River <b>Plate</b> <b>finished</b> the last {{for the first time in}} its history.|$|R
50|$|The Konica Hexar RF {{is similar}} in {{form-factor}} to Leica M-mount cameras, being slightly larger than the archetypal Leica M3 design in all dimensions, and just slightly heavier when batteries are fitted. Body construction is a cast-aluminium chassis with titanium top and bottom <b>plates,</b> <b>finished</b> in flat black, with a rubberised cover and slightly raised hand-grip. The chassis of the Hexar RF appears to be identical to that used by the Contax G2, with different top and bottom plates and similar but not identical film transport and shutter mechanisms. While the Hexar RF appears in some ways similar to the earlier auto-focus Konica Hexar camera, it seems to share few if any components with that camera.|$|R
