40|$|To {{address the}} {{trade-off}} between new product innovativeness and speed to market caused by customer participation activities, the author differentiates two dimensions of customer participation - customer participation as an information resource (CPI) and customer participation as a codeveloper (CPC) - and explores the moderating effects of downstream customer network connectivity and new {{product development process}} interdependence and complexity. Matched data collected from 143 customer-component manufacturer dyads indicate that CPI has a negative influence on innovativeness when downstream customer network connectivity is high but a positive effect when it is low. In contrast, CPI has {{a positive effect on}} speed to market when downstream customer network connectivity is high and no significant effect when it is low. In addition, CPC undermines new <b>product</b> <b>speed</b> to market when process interdependence is high. In contrast, CPC can improve new <b>product</b> <b>speed</b> to market but hurt new product innovativeness when process interdependence is low.

40|$|Five meta-analyses {{previously}} {{have been}} published {{on the topic of}} new product development involving the concept of new <b>product</b> development <b>speed.</b> Three of these studies have investigated antecedents to new product development success, of which just one was new <b>product</b> development <b>speed.</b> The other two studies used new <b>product</b> development <b>speed</b> as the dependent variable, and analyzed antecedents to achieving speed. This article extends previous empirical generalizations in this domain by using a meta-analytic methodology to understand the link between new <b>product</b> development <b>speed</b> and new <b>product</b> success at a more granular level. Specifically, it considers the relationship with different dimensions of success as measured overall or compositely, operationally (i. e., the process measures of decreasing development costs and proficiently managing market entry timing and the product measures of technical product performance and product competitive advantage), and relative to external success outcomes (i. e., customer based and financial success). While the results indicate that, in general, new <b>product</b> development <b>speed</b> is associated with improving success outcomes, those relationships may diminish or even disappear depending upon a number of methodological design decisions and research contexts. A subsequent meta-analysis of the antecedents of development speed provides a more holistic picture of development speed. These results are broadly consistent with those produced by another recent meta-analytic investigation of the issue. Together, these findings have important implications for academics pursuing further research in this domain, as well as for managers considering implementing a program to increase new <b>product</b> development <b>speed...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{dissociation}} of OCS {{has been}} investigated subsequent to excitation at 248 nm. Speed distributions, speed dependent translational anisotropy parameters, angular momentum alignment, and orientation are reported for the channel leading to S((1) D(2)). In agreement with previous experiments, two <b>product</b> <b>speed</b> regimes have been identified, correlating with differing degrees of rotational excitation in the CO coproducts. The velocity dependence of the translational anisotropy is also shown to be in agreement with previous work. However, contrary to previous interpretations, the speed dependence is shown to primarily reflect the effects of nonaxial recoil and {{to be consistent with}} predominant excitation to the 2 (1) A(') electronic state. It is proposed that the associated electronic transition moment is polarized in the molecular plane, at an angle greater than approximately 60 degrees to the initial linear OCS axis. The atomic angular momentum polarization data are interpreted in terms of a simple long-range interaction model to help identify likely surfaces populated during dissociation. Although the model neglects coherence between surfaces, the polarization data are shown to be consistent with the proposed dissociation mechanisms for the two <b>product</b> <b>speed</b> regimes. Large values for the low and high rank in-plane orientation parameters are reported. These are {{believed to be the first}} example of a polyatomic system where these effects are found to be of the same order of magnitude as the angular momentum alignment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{bad quality}} of {{machining}} surfaces {{caused by the}} micro wear of pressing parts {{has been a very}} big trouble for the engineers over the past decades. In order to decrease the surface wear, the technology of heat treatment is used popular. Many papers about the heat treatment technology had been proposed. Especially, the deep cryogenic treatment has been used widely for the purpose of wear-resistance in the industry. Moreover, the method of using variations of surface magnetization to monitor the dynamic tribological properties between the metal pairs has been applied successfully by the author. Therefore, this paper is base on the above statements to further investigate the tribological properties of the tool steel by deep cryogenic treatment. It can be clarified for effects of different deep cryogenic treatment temperatures on wear-resistance of the tool steel DC 53.

Whether this trend is occurring more widely in European companies {{has yet to be}} confirmed, but some authors suggest that it is [4]–[7]. This exploratory study investigates to what extent four companies are using local and UK based suppliers and the level of importance they assign to a number of factors when selecting them. It is found that the 4 manufacturing companies interviewed were all using suppliers of manufactured parts and materials locally (within Wales) and the UK but the extent of this varied between companies. The use of local suppliers varied from less than 5 percent to 25 percent and the use of United Kingdom (UK) suppliers varied from 30 to 100 percent. The four main drivers for using local and UK suppliers were: quality of <b>product,</b> <b>speed</b> of communication, flexibility and accredited quality system. The main challenges were: the ability to offer manufacturing capabilities in very high value and nano technologies, and the availability of events to showcase local and UK suppliers.

40|$|Product {{development}} {{is an essential}} component of a successful manufacturing business. As an interdisciplinary activity with several different actors, one of its aspects involves Product Environmental Performance considerations, and this is becoming an area where companies see opportunities for competition. In light of increasing pressures to adopt more sustainable approaches to product design and manufacture, the requirement to develop sustainable products {{is one of the key}} challenges facing manufacturing industry in the 21 st century. Besides the Product Environmental Performance, there are three key requirements to be considered, which include Product Life Cycle Cost, Product Quality, and Product Lead Time. Product Life Cycle Cost and Product Quality are very traditional facets in decision-making in a design process. A product with low cost and high performance is always the objective in industry. For the last two decades, shortening the Product Lead Time to increase profits is another key requirement that has been adopted. Trade-offs among these four key requirements are necessary when choices have to be made between different alternatives. In this research, an integrated methodology is proposed to balance the environmental performance of a product against traditional design objectives, in the decision making process during the early design stage. Finally, a concept of product performance indicator was introduced to compare product design activities. In order to achieve this, a weighting system has been developed to assess the total performance of competing design alternatives. Later, this weighting system is integrated into a fuzzy model in order to compensate for the fuzziness in the available data. Additionally, the method is used to rank five important product development features, which are Technology Level of the <b>Product,</b> <b>Speed</b> of Technical Development, Product Life Cycle, Price Competitiveness, and Environmental Awareness, assisted by the weighting system. Finally, a total product performance concept is proposed in order to allow the user to carry out trade-off analysis between different design alternatives. Two case studies, which are a car sunroof and a mobile phone, were used to test the validity of the produce performance methodology proposed in this research...|$|E
