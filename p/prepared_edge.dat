40|$|The {{morphology}} and {{geometry of}} free edges on steel structures have a notable {{influence on the}} corrosion protection performance of coating systems. A badly <b>prepared</b> <b>edge,</b> whether thermally or mechanically generated, will be {{a starting point for}} coating deterioration and subsequent steel corrosion. A research program on how edge geometry and coating type affect the corrosion protection performance of organic coatings on edges involved the use of different edge preparation tools and of different coating systems. The investigations included the use of thermal cutting tools, because these {{are an integral part of}} construction lines in modern shipbuilding yards as well as mechanical (milling, grinding) and thermal methods (laser, plasma). Testing methods included the long-term testing of samples in a specially designed ballast tank coating test chamber, condensation chamber tests, electric impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and dry film thickness (DFT) measurements on polished cross sections of coated edges. It was found that the edge geometry parameter does not help to control the corrosion protection performance of organic coatings under simulated water ballast tank conditions. Other effects like edge treatment method/tool and coating application are more important. It seems that DFT, or barrier resistance, is not a suitable parameter to control the deterioration of the coating systems, nor does it control their corrosion protection capability. More complex processes, such as combined mechanical, physical, and thermal loads, are responsible for the corrosion protection action of the systems...|$|E

40|$|Quantum Lyapunov control uses a {{feedback}} control methodology to determine control fields which {{are applied to}} control quantum systems in an open-loop way. In this work, we adopt two Lyapunov control schemes to <b>prepare</b> an <b>edge</b> state for a fermionic chain consisted of cold atoms loaded in an optical lattice. Such a chain can be described by the Harper model. Corresponding to the two schemes, state distance and state error Lyapunov functions are considered. The results show that both the schemes are effective to <b>prepare</b> the <b>edge</b> state within {{a wide range of}} parameters. We found that the edge state can be prepared with high fidelity even if there are moderate fluctuations in on-site or hopping potentials. Both control schemes can be extended to similar chains (3 m+d, d= 2) of different lengths. Since regular amplitude control field is easier to apply in practice, amplitude-modulated control fields are used to replace the unmodulated one to <b>prepare</b> the <b>edge</b> state. Such control approaches provide tools to explore edge states for one dimensional topological materials...|$|R
40|$|Preparing topological {{states of}} quantum matter, such as edge states, {{is one of}} the most {{important}} directions in condensed matter physics. In this work, we present a proposal to <b>prepare</b> <b>edge</b> states in Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) model with open boundaries, which takes advantage of Lyapunov control to design operations. We show that edge states can be obtained with almost arbitrary initial states. A numerical optimalization for the control is performed and the dependence of control process on the system size is discussed. The merit of this proposal is that the shaking exerts only on the boundaries of the model. As a by-product, a topological entangled state is achieved by elaborately designing the shaking scheme.

40|$|International audienceOne of the {{criteria}} mastering {{the choice of a}} cutting tool is its wear resistance. For coated inserts, prior to the coating process, edge preparation method choice will impact their performance. So, a classification based on its impact on wear resistance is needed. Indeed, the flank wear of three coated cemented carbide inserts presenting differently <b>prepared</b> <b>edges</b> (untreated, dragging and magneto-abrasive machining) is explored experimentally. Those inserts are used to face mill the hardened AISI 4140 low alloy steel. Further, by means of the principal component analysis (PCA), correlations between the online measured cutting forces and flank wear behaviour are investigated. In view of this analysis, for each studied case, the statistical law predicting flank wear relying on cutting forces components is established with fair approximation. However, the experimental results have quantitatively shown that edge preparation could be in some cases not beneficial for tool wear resistance of the milling inserts considering either maximal or average flank wear...|$|R
40|$|The “North Atlantic Ice-Edge Corridor” {{hypothesis}} {{proposes that}} {{sometime during the}} Last Glacial Maximum, roughly 26, 500 – 19, 000 years ago, human populations from southern France and the Iberian Peninsula made {{their way across the}} North Atlantic and colonized North America. A key element of that hypothesis is the apparent similarity between stone-tool-production techniques of Solutrean peoples of Western Europe and Clovis and purportedly pre-Clovis peoples of eastern North America, most especially the supposed intentional use of “controlled overshot flaking,” a technique for thinning a bifacial stone tool during manufacture. Overshot flakes, struck from <b>prepared</b> <b>edges</b> of the tool, travel across the face and remove part of the opposite margin. Experimental and archaeological data demonstrate, however, that the most parsimonious explanation for the production of overshot flakes is that they are accidental products created incidentally and inconsistently as knappers attempt to thin bifaces. Thus, instead of representing historical divergence, overshot flakes in Clovis and Solutrean assemblages mark convergence {{in the use of the}} same simple solution for thinning bifaces that produced analogous detritus...|$|R

50|$|Due to the {{precision}} of orbital TIG welding, even the smallest standard tube diameters from 1.6 millimetres can be processed. On a larger scale, pipes with diameters up to 170mm and walls up to 3.5mm thick can be joined using closed chamber weld heads. These weld heads allow the torch to be positioned very precisely and ensure that the pipe is held securely. The inert gas atmosphere in the closed chamber prevents heat from tinting, even with the most sensitive of materials. For tube diameters between 8 and 275mm, {{it is possible to}} use more manageable open welding heads (except for high purity applications). A flexible hose system is used to supply the welding head with power, inert gas, cooling water and filler wire where required. The need for filler wire during the welding process depends on the type of welding task; thicker tube walls and difficult-to-control parent materials require the use of additional material, whereas thin-walled tubes can be welded without extra wire.In order to create high quality weld seams it is essential that tube ends are carefully <b>prepared</b> with the <b>edges</b> of the workpieces being free of scale and impurities. For thinner-walled tubes up to medium diameters, a simple right-angled saw cut is often sufficient. For thicker tube walls it is necessary to <b>prepare</b> the <b>edges</b> more carefully, for example using a U-groove cross-section.|$|R

After specifying an extended Aubry-André-Harper model, we check the localization transition for all the eigenstates and eigenenergy band splitting behavior versus a system parameter. To examine the effect of localization transition on dynamical processes, firstly, the slowly pumping of the edge states are examined. In the dynamical processes, the system acts as conductor for the excitation in the nonlocal region and insulator in the localized region. Then by quantum Lyapunov control method with different control Hamiltonians, we <b>prepare</b> an <b>edge</b> localized state which exists in the nonlocal region. Compared to that in the nonlocal region, the control effect is suppressed in the localized region. Then we employ the entropy and occupation imbalance between even and odd sites to indicate the localization transition further.

40|$|The present work aims {{to find a}} {{good way}} to {{automatically}} trace the velocity profile in vessels shown in continuous wave Doppler spectrograms, replacing the more traditional manual tracing, easy to perform but rich in drawbacks. Different methods of pre-processing this kind of images in order to <b>prepare</b> the <b>edge</b> detection step are presented.

Two main strategies are tested: a mild pre-processing before edge detection, followed by an edge linking step to fill the gaps in the extracted contour, or a stronger pre-processing that guarantees a continuous contour without further operations. A comparison is made on the obtained results and it is shown that the two approaches are somehow complementary in their pros and cons. In further work, the strengths of the two strategies should be combined in a hybrid method that would guarantee a good compromise between continuity of edges and mathematical-based detection of boundarie...|$|R

40|$|Ion milling, wedge cutting or polishing, {{and focused}} ion beam (FIB) milling are widely-used {{techniques}} for the transmission electron microscope (TEM) sample preparation. Especially, the FIB milling provides a site-specific analysis, deposition, and ablation of materials in the micrometer and nanometer scale. However, the cost of FIB tools has been always a significant concern. Since it is inevitable to use the FIB technique, the improvement of efficiency is a key point. Traditional TEM sample preparation with FIB was routinely implemented on a single sample each time. Aiming at cost efficiency, a new pre-thinning technique for batch sample preparation was developed in this paper. The present proposal combines the sample preparation techniques with multi-samples thinning, cross-section scanning electron microscopy (SEM), wedge cutting, FIB and other sample pre-thinning techniques. The new pre-thinning technique is to <b>prepare</b> an <b>edge</b> TEM sample on a grinding and polishing fixture with a slant surface. The thickness of the wedges sample can be measured to 1 ∼ 2 μm under optical microscope. Therefore, this fixture is superior to the traditional optical method of estimating the membrane thickness.

40|$|Abstract — A {{blind person}} {{in an urban}} {{environment}} has to navigate around obstacles and hazards. Though {{a significant amount of}} work has been done on detecting obstacles, not much attention has been given to the detection of drop offs, e. g., sidewalk curbs, downward stairs, and other hazards where an error could lead to disastrous consequences. In this paper, we propose algorithms for detecting obstacles in an urban setting using stereo vision and Two-Stage Dynamic Programming (TSDP) technique. We are developing computer vision algorithms for sensing important terrain features as an aid to blind navigation, which interpret visual information obtained from images collected by cameras mounted on camera legs nearly as high as young person. This paper focuses specifically on a novel computer vision algorithm for detecting obstacles, which are important and ubiquitous features on and near sidewalks and other walkways. A fast and robust stereo matching algorithm is proposed that uses only features in order to find a semi-dense disparity map. It works by growing from a small set of correspondence seeds. In this paper we use Normalized Cross-correlation (NCC) function matching with a 5 × 5 window and <b>prepare</b> an <b>edge</b> detected matching table τ and start growing disparity components by drawing a seed s from S which is computed using Sobel edge detector, and adding it to τ. It results in high accuracy and performance. The obstacle identified in the proposed method which appears in the disparity map enters the phase of depth computing. The algorithm extracts as much information as possible from depth information obtained from a stereo system. The proposed method is tested on a Pentium 4 Dual CPU 2. 00 GHz PC with 2. 00 GB of RAM and achieves better RMS error and bad matching percentage compared to previous methods. Experimental results are demonstrated on typical sidewalk scenes to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In recent years, ZCL has become a serious and increasing public health problem in Yazd province. Following the epidemic of CL in Khatam county of Yazd province, this study was carried out to determine the animal reservoir hosts and human infection in 2005 - 2006. Methods: 300 households were examined in February 2006 and corresponding forms were completed for each household during a house-to-house visit. Rodents were caught by 20 live traps, biweekly from late August to late November 2006. The rodents were identified morphologically and 4 impression smears were <b>prepared</b> from the <b>edge</b> of their ear lobes. The causative agent of the disease was isolated from humans and rodents characterized by RAPD-PCR method.

40|$|Background and aim. It {{has been}} {{reported}} that femoral hernias are rather common after a previous repair of inguinal hernia. We herein present a modified patch repair technique for large femoral hernias that develop after a Lichtenstein operation for ipsilateral inguinal hernia. Patients and methods. The modified technique for femoral hernia was applied to three patients who had a Lichtenstein repair for inguinal hernia. All patients were male. Hernia sac is dissected completely and sent back into to the preperitoneal space. Special attention should be given to the prevascular component of the sac. It is dissected as deep as possible into the preperitoneal space over the femoral vein. The defect is quite wide in this particular type of femoral hernia following Lichtenstein repair. A prosthetic patch that matches the defect is <b>prepared.</b> The medial <b>edge</b> of the mesh is configured to correspond to the pubic corner and lacunar ligament. The lateral margin of the patch is cut to create several petals for inverting the mesh above and medial to the femoral vein to prevent prevascular herniation. The mesh is secured to inguinal ligament, ilioinguinal tract, lacunar ligament, and Cooper ligament. Few sutures are put on the pubic corner and lacunar ligament. Results. One patient was discharged after two hours, other two stayed overnight. Readmission because of seroma development was recorded in two cases where standard polypropylene meshes were used. No complication was observed in the other patient who received lightweight meshes. No early recurrences were recorded after 4, 9, and 30 months. Conclusion. Femoral recurrence after previous inguinal hernia repair seems to be a specific entity. It has a prevascular component and the hernia defect can be much larger than that of a primary femoral hernia. A patch repair with infra-inguinal approach can be a valuable alternative with low complication rate...|$|R
