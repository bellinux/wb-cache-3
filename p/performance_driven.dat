50|$|A {{weighted}} {{shift knob}} is a <b>performance</b> <b>driven</b> aftermarket modification which entirely replaces the OEM shift knob and sits atop the aftermarket short shifter or OEM manual shift stick. Initially {{designed to be}} used in tandem with a short shifter, it is increasingly being purchased for stock stick shifts. The weight generally varies between 400 and 600 grams or more, depending on the material used. The principle of the weighted shift knob is to make the stick shifter top heavy, thus increasing the throw momentum in order to decrease time between shifts. Weighted gear knobs are offered for sale by a variety of North American-based manufacturers in many shapes and finishes, though they are significantly more expensive than the commonly available aftermarket shift knob.|$|E
50|$|Keiley's {{early work}} {{was marked by}} its size and its goals of {{mathematical}} precision. She was deeply inspired {{by the work of}} Edward Gordon Craig, and sought in her large chorus driven pieces to emulate an director driven theatre marked by <b>performance</b> <b>driven</b> spectacles. Her next piece following Freud was The Cheat (1996), a movement piece for 82 performers based on the music notation of Johann Sebastian Bach's Fugue in G Minor. In 1997 she created and premiered Under Wraps with Robert Chafe and Petrina Bromley. Under Wraps was a two person story of gay unrequited love told atop a 40' x 60' parachute cloth. Under the cloth there was a chorus of 16 who sang and manipulated the sheet to create a constant visual and aural accompaniment to the action above. Under Wraps was Keiley's first collaboration with Chafe and Bromley. It played three sold out runs in St. John's and toured to Halifax (1999), Calgary (2000), Banff (2000), and Vancouver (2000). In 2013, Keiley, Chafe, and Bromley updated the show and remounted it with a brand new cast.|$|E

50|$|The Magik Markers are a noise {{rock band}} from Hartford, Connecticut. The members, Elisa Ambrogio, Pete Nolan and Leah Quimby started the band in their {{basement}} in 2001. The band gained wider recognition after opening for Sonic Youth on their American tour in 2004. Their debut album, I Trust My Guitar, Etc... (released in vinyl only), {{was released in}} 2005 on Thurston Moore's Ecstatic Peace label. In 2006, they released A Panegyric To The Things I Do Not Understand under Gulcher Records, the Markers' first proper CD. Also in 2006, the band recorded a session for Southern records' Latitudes series, which was released as The Voldoror Dance. Leah Quimby left in May 2006 {{to pursue a career}} in ventriloquism. Various people filled in before they eventually settled as a duo composed of original members Pete and Elisa. In September 2007, the band released Boss, which was produced by Lee Ranaldo.

Following {{in the wake of the}} Textile release For Sada Jane and the Road Pussy CD-R, the band set out to more accurately capture the sound of Magik Markers practices and jams, as opposed to the <b>performance</b> <b>driven</b> chaos of live shows.|$|E
5000|$|On December 2, 2013, Complex named [...] "Shabba" [...] {{the third}} best song {{released}} in 2013. They commented saying, [...] "As {{the son of}} Trini parents growing up in Harlem, Ferg was raised around Caribbean sounds, so it's fascinating to see him {{pay tribute to the}} dancehall emperor by breaking down Shabba’s essence to a mathematical equation. “Eight gold rings” x “four gold chains” x “two bad bitches” x “one gold tooth” = Shabba Ranks. Getting Shabba to appear in the song’s infectiously raucous video, and later on a remix, is more than a co-sign, it’s a coup de grace that elevates this sure-shot party-starter to more than just a simple shout-out. So when Ferg says “my yute don’t ramp with me,” trust and believe that he knows exactly what he’s talking about." [...] Pitchfork Media ranked it at number 23 on their list of the top 100 tracks of 2013. They elaborated saying, [...] "Ferg's rubberband flow tauntingly flossing about making raw-dogging his key to relationship trust, rocking gear like it's Mortal Kombat couture. ... Even with all the punchlines, it's a <b>performance</b> <b>driven</b> almost entirely by charisma - factory-line machinery beats assembling a disco-lit 25-foot riser for Ferg and Rocky to ascend, their Morse code stutter-step voices slipping into a semi-patois flow so catchy it could get away with saying less than it actually does." ...|$|E
5000|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{examined}} the neural correlates of emergence of the sense of agency under normal circumstances. This appears to involve consistent congruence between what is being produced through efferent outflow to the musculature of the body, and what is being sensed as the presumed product in the periphery of this efferent command signal. In alien hand syndrome, the neural mechanisms involved in establishing that this congruence has occurred may be impaired. This may involve an abnormality in the brain mechanism that differentiates between [...] "re-afference" [...] (i.e., the return of kinesthetic sensation from the self-generated [...] "active" [...] limb movement) and [...] "ex-afference" [...] (i.e., kinesthetic sensation generated from an externally produced 'passive' limb movement in which an active self does not participate). This brain mechanism is proposed to involve the production of a parallel [...] "efference copy" [...] signal that is sent directly to the somatic sensory regions and is transformed into a [...] "corollary discharge", an expected afferent signal from the periphery that would result from the <b>performance</b> <b>driven</b> by the issued efferent signal. The correlation of the corollary discharge signal with the actual afferent signal returned from the periphery can then be used to determine if, in fact, the intended action occurred as expected. When the sensed result of the action is congruent with the predicted result, then the action can be labelled as self-generated and associated with an emergent sense of agency.|$|E
