40|$|International audienceThe {{viability}} of eradicating {{bovine viral diarrhoea}} (BVD) in Scottish <b>suckler</b> <b>herds</b> {{is dependent on the}} continued compliance with eradication schemes. At the farm level, the costs of BVD have been identified in previous studies and show a substantial financial imperative to avoid infection. At a regional level the incentives of BVD eradication to individuals are unclear, for example the requirement for vaccination strategies despite achieving disease-free status. Ensuring farmer compliance with an eradication scheme is therefore difficult. Experience of eradicating BVD from beef-dominated areas is limited and theoretical models have tended to focus on the dairy sector. Here we present a stochastic epidemiological model of a typical beef <b>suckler</b> <b>herd</b> to explore the interaction of a farm with a regional pool of replacements, utilising information from a BVD virus seroprevalence survey of Scottish beef <b>suckler</b> <b>herds.</b> Our epidemiological model is then used to assess the relative costs to individuals assuming different regional endemic prevalences, which are used to represent the likelihood of BVD re-introduction. We explore the relative cost of BVD, taken as likelihood and consequence, at an endemic steady state in contrast to previous models that have assumed the introduction or control of BVD in an epidemic state (e. g. a closed and mostly susceptible population). Where endemic, BVD is unlikely to affect all farms evenly and will cost most farmers very little due to herd immunity or self-clearance of the virus. Compliance is likely to be boosted by pump-priming to initiate and complete eradication schemes with cost-sharing...|$|R

40|$|Movement {{of animals}} between farms {{represents}} a potential risk of bovine tuberculosis (BTB) and other disease transmission. The objectives {{of this study}} were to identify and quantify risk factors associated with the first between-herd movement of animals (denoted as risk move). A random sample of 1 percent of Irish calf births registered for 2002 (20, 182 animals) was selected. Descriptive and survival analysis on movement over the period 2002 – 2005 was performed. A total of 12, 119 (60 %) of animals experienced a risk move over the 4 -year study period. Among those that moved, 57 % did so within the first 12 months of age. For animals in dairy herds, an early peak in risk move events was observed within the first 12 weeks of age; whereas in animals from <b>suckler</b> <b>herds,</b> a later risk move peak was observed between 21 and 36 weeks of age. The survival models identified a number of risk factors: two that appeared most important in predicting a risk move were gender and enterprise type. Males had a hazard ratio of 2. 6 times that of females. The hazards for enterprise type, varied over time, thus a time-varying covariate (ent_type × ln(time)) was included in the Cox model. At 7 days of age, females in <b>suckler</b> <b>herds</b> were at 0. 14 times the hazard of females in dairy herds for risk move, and over time, the hazards converged, equalised by day 140, and then diverged, so that by 4 years of age, females in <b>suckler</b> <b>herds</b> were at 4. 64 times the hazard of females in dairy herds. Herds with a history of selling animals in previous years maintained that record during the study period with increased hazard of risk move. Enterprise type interacted with gender so that relative to females, males from dairy herds were at greater hazard of risk move than males from <b>suckler</b> <b>herds.</b> Hazard of risk move was also a function of ln (herd area), so that each doubling of farm area was accompanied by a 30. 6 % decrease in the hazards. The main conclusion was that risk of movement related disease transmission also depends on the purpose of the movement whether for breeding or for beef finishing. While males were at greater hazard of movement than females, they would have a shorter lifespan, thus limiting the opportunity for further transmission post-movemen...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a Markov chain model {{based on}} the cow’s {{reproductive}} cycle, and a financial model were developed to study the variation in profitability in Scottish beef <b>suckler</b> <b>herds</b> resulting from the effect on fertility of disease and/or the employment of alternative management practices. The factors affecting fertility to be economically evaluated were chosen {{based on the}} results of the regression analysis combined with the recommendations from the literature. The selected factors were: LBS, feeding management, bull management, the effect of animal disease, i. e. BVDV, and restricted suckling. Feeding management was found to be the most important factor diminishing the financial performance of <b>suckler</b> <b>herds.</b> The total gross margin (GM) was found to diminish by 25 % between the optima as a result of the application of a poor and a moderate feeding regimes combined with alternatives lengths of breeding season (LBS) ranging from 42 to 147 days. There were also interactions between the effect of poor bull performance and the LBS so that the effect of poor bull performance is markedly increased by the employment of a short LBS. The losses produced by a BVDV infection varied depending on the proportion of animals of the herd infected by this virus, which varies over time. This aspect was estimated using the model of Gunn et al. (2004), which then provided inputs for the estimation of reproductive performance and gross margins using the models reported here. It was found that BVDV drops profitability of Scottish beef <b>suckler</b> <b>herds</b> by up to 23 %. Finally, when restricted suckling was applied for alternative LBS and compared with the economic performance as a result of the application of ad libitum suckling, it was found that profitability was improved by 14 % between the two optima.

40|$|Information was {{collected}} on cow and sire breeds in both dairy and <b>suckler</b> <b>herds</b> in the National Farm Survey (NFS) in autumn 1998. The {{number of farms}} {{included in the analysis}} was 1030 with farms containing less than 2 economic size units (equivalent to 3 to 4 dairy cows) excluded from the sample. The main findings of the survey were as follows: • Ninety-eight percent of dairy cows and 96 % of dairy herd replacements were Friesian/Holstein • The <b>suckler</b> cow <b>herd</b> contained 46 % early-maturing breed crosses (Hereford 31 %, Aberdeen Angus 12 % and Shorthorn 3 %) 2 % Friesians, 48 % of the three main continental breed crosses (Charolais 17 %, Simmental 16 %, Limousin 15 %) and 4 % other (mainly continental crosses). Compared to the adult cows herd replacements had less early-maturing breed crosses and Friesians (total 42 %) and more (55 %) of the three main continental breed crosses (Charolais 20 %, Simmental 15 %, Limousin 20 %). • Overall, in 1998, it was estimated that the national cow herd consisted of 52 % Friesian/Holstein, 23 % early maturing breed crosses and 26 % late maturing breed crosses. • Forty-seven percent of dairy cows were bred to Friesian/Holstein sires, 26 % were bred to early maturing sire breeds and 27 % were bred to continental sire breeds. The corresponding figure for dairy herd replacements were 40 %, 46 % and 13 %. • Seventeen percent of suckler cows were bred to early maturing sire breeds, 46 % were bred to Charolais, 16 % were bred to Simmental, 17 % were bred to Limousin and the remaining 6 % were bred to mainly other continental breed sires. The sires used on <b>suckler</b> <b>herd</b> replacements were 43 % early maturing breeds, 16 % Charolais, 10 % Simmental, 25 % Limousin and 5 % other. • Based on the sire breeds used in 1998, the breed composition of the 1999 calf crop was estimated to be 24 % Friesian/Holstein, 24 % early maturing breeds, 24 % Charolais cross, 10 % Simmental cross, 12 % Limousin cross and 6 % other (mainly other continental crosses). • Although the proportion of continental breed crosses in the calf crop continues to increase (48 % in 1993 to 52 % in 1999), the use of continental sire breeds is declining in the dairy herd (from 33 % in 1992 to 27 % in 1998), particularly where AI is the method of breeding. However, this trend may be at an end as the 1999 AI figures to date (September 30) show substantial decreases in Hereford and Aberdeen Angus inseminations with increases in Belgian Blue, Limousin and Friesian/Holstein. • The dairy herd is a relatively unimportant source of the better quality animals accounting for only 25 % of total continental breed crosses which have a lower proportion of continental breed genes than those from the <b>suckler</b> <b>herd.</b> • It was estimated that the 1999 calf crop from the <b>suckler</b> <b>herd</b> consisted of 18 % early maturing breeds, 29 % of half to threequarters continental breed genes and 53 % containing at least three-quarters continental breed genes. • A total of 48, 200 herds used bulls. The proportion of bulls of each breed used were 9 % Frieisan/Holstein, 17 % Hereford, 11 % Aberdeen Angus, 1 % Shorthorn, 29 % Charolais, 12 % Simmental, 16 % Limousin and 5 % other. Continental breeds accounted for 38 % and 84 % of bulls on dairy and suckler farm, respectively. • In the present study the number of animals (cows plus replacements) bred to continental sire breeds was 1. 22 million of which 40 % were by AI. • National AI figures show that the total number of inseminations (excluding DIY) have declined from 1. 03 million in 1992 to 0. 79 million in 1998. • Assuming that the suckler cow should be at least half continental breeding and that Belgian Blue crosses are unsuitable if increases in calving problems are to be avoided then the dair y herd may provide as little as 25 % of suitable <b>suckler</b> <b>herd</b> replacements. Thus, the main source of replacements would be from within the <b>suckler</b> <b>herd.</b> Factors to be considered include hybrid vigour which involves crossbreeding, milk production potential of the cow {{and the fact that the}} most widely used terminal sire is Charolais. In these circumstances one suitable crossbred cow would be obtained from alternate crossing with Limousin and Simmental sires. • Heat synchronisation was used on 3 % of herds. The figures for dairy and <b>suckler</b> <b>herds</b> was 6. 8 % and 0. 5 %, respectively. • Vaccination for leptospirosis was used on 29 % of dairy farms and 4 % of suckler farms.

40|$|Growth {{rate and}} carcass value are {{important}} determinants of profitability, with carcasses of good conformation (muscularity) commanding the highest {{prices on the}} premium export markets (mainland EU). Therefore, the objective in suckling is that the progeny are of high growth potential and produce carcasses of good conformation. Breed is the major factor influencing conformation, with the late-maturing continental breeds superior to the early-maturing British breeds (Hereford and Aberdeen Angus) and vastly superior to the Friesian/Holstein. The continental breeds also have greater growth potential than the other breeds. The type of carcasses required {{are similar to those}} produced from the <b>suckler</b> <b>herd</b> in France where over 80 % of cows are purebred Charolais, Limousin or Blonde d'Aquitaine. However, experimental data have shown that the heterosis (hybrid vigour) resulting from use of a crossbred as opposed to purebred cows increases the weight of calf weaned per cow bred by 14 %, with a further 8 % arising from using a third breed of sire on a crossbred cow. Because of the emphasis on conformation, producers are retaining replacements from within the herds with a tendency towards purebreds rather than crossbreds. It is thus important to examine the relative productivity of various crossbred and purebred cows to provide clear guidelines on the most desirable breeding programme for the <b>suckler</b> <b>herd.</b> The project involved 5 cow breed types (0. 5, 0. 75 and 1. 0 Limousin genes, Simmental x (Limousin x Friesian) and purebred Charolais) with a common sire used on all cows.

The model design process involved user consultation and participation and the model is freely accessible on a dedicated website. The 'user-friendly' model interface allows the input of key assumptions and farm specific parameters enabling model simulations to be tailored to individual farm circumstances. The model simulates the effect of Johne's disease and various measures for its control in terms of herd prevalence and the shedding states of animals within the herd, the financial costs of the disease and of any control measures and the likely benefits of control of Johne's disease for the beef <b>suckler</b> <b>herd</b> over a 10 -year period. The model thus helps to make more transparent the 'hidden costs' of Johne's in a herd and the likely benefits to be gained from controlling the disease. The control strategies considered within the model are 'no control', 'testing and culling of diagnosed animals', 'improving management measures' or a dual strategy of 'testing and culling in association with improving management measures'. An example 'run' of the model shows that the strategy 'improving management measures', which reduces infection routes during the early stages, results in a marked fall in herd prevalence and total costs.

The final part of the project evolved into component studies to determine the effect of supplementary feed on the performance of grazing bulls (Experiment 3), and the consequences of weanling cattle grazing pasture in winter as an alternative to housing them in winter (Experiments 4 to 7).

A United Utilities spokesperson commented: [...] "We continue to explore all options open to us for the future of Sleddale Hall". Locals also stated that United Utilities did not want to sell Sleddale Hall to Withnail fans, due to worries that thousands of visitors would spoil the beauty spot. In 2006 the Hall was re-roofed.Sleddale Hall is tenanted by a farmer, Mike Harrison, whose <b>suckler</b> <b>herd</b> which produces Blonde d'Aquitaine crossbred calves won the 2008 British Blonde Society’s biannual UK Commercial Herd of the Year Award. A judge said that the award was notable [...] "considering the type of hard farm he is rearing them on": at Sleddale Hall the cows graze at between 980 ft to 1450 ft above sea level, on rough grazing. The house itself was still dilapidated and uninhabited as of September 2008.|$|R
30|$|Depending on {{the animal}} (and the {{exposure}} pathway and source), PCDD/Fs or dl-PCBs can contribute in various ratios to TEQ. dl-PCBs {{are often the}} main contributor. For example, in the German federal monitoring plan for beef from <b>suckler</b> cow <b>herds,</b> more than 90 % of the regulatory TEQ exceedances in meat were from dl-PCBs. On the other hand, in 60 investigated small free-range chicken flocks in the Netherlands, the TEQ contribution from PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs was similar, with a slightly higher impact from PCDD/Fs [31].|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} the {{management}} of reproduction on 66 Scottish <b>suckler</b> <b>herds</b> calving in spring 2003 was analysed using multiple regression. The predicted mean value of suckled calves produced was £ 237 /cow (SE 1. 8). The regression coefficients of the predictors was 0. 74 (0. 05), 15 (3. 9) and 248 (16. 5) for date of first calving, average number of 21 -day calving periods (calving spread) and proportion of cows barren respectively. Improving each predictor by 1 SD had the combined potential to improve predicted calf value by £ 64 /cow, over 80 % of the current typical gross margin {{for this type of}} enterprise. Bull care had a significant influence on calving spread and number of biosecurity measures taken had a positive influence on the proportion of cows barren. However, length of breeding season had no significant impact on the above predictors. Reproductive performance was highly variable and indicators were considerably poorer than published targets. It was concluded that farmers in this sample were not managing their herds for high reproductive performance and output as often advocated. This result suggests considerable scope for improved private and public benefits from the management of reproduction in this type of beef production system.

40|$|Abstract Background Recently, a Risk Assessment {{methodology}} {{was applied}} to animal welfare issues in {{a report of the}} European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on intensively housed calves. Methods Because this is a new and potentially influential approach to derive conclusions on animal welfare issues, a so-called semantic-modelling type 'validation' study was conducted by asking expert scientists, who had been involved or quoted in the report, to give welfare scores for housing systems and for welfare hazards. Results Kendall's coefficient of concordance among experts (n = 24) was highly significant (P Systems with the lowest scores were veal calves kept individually in so-called "baby boxes" (veal crates) or in small groups, and feedlots. A <b>suckler</b> <b>herd</b> on pasture was rated as the best for calf welfare. The main hazards were related to underfeeding, inadequate colostrum intake, poor stockperson education, insufficient space, inadequate roughage, iron deficiency, inadequate ventilation, poor floor conditions and no bedding. Points for improvement of the Risk Assessment applied to animal welfare include linking information, reporting uncertainty and transparency about underlying values. Conclusion The study provides novel information on expert opinion in relation to calf welfare and shows that Risk Assessment applied to animal welfare can benefit from a semantic modelling approach. </p...|$|R
40|$|Bovine viral {{diarrhoea}} virus (BVDV) causes {{an economically}} important endemic disease (BVD) of cattle in Ireland and worldwide. Systematic eradication by detection and removal of infectious (BVDV carrier) cattle {{has been successful}} in several regions. We therefore assessed the benefits (disease losses avoided) and costs (testing and culling regime) of a potential eradication programme in Ireland. Published bio-economic models of BVDV spread in beef <b>suckler</b> <b>herds</b> and dairy herds were adapted to estimate potential benefits of eradication in Ireland. A simple model of BVDV spread in beef finisher herds was devised to estimate the benefits of eradication in this sector. A six year eradication programme consisting of 5 inter-related virological and serological testing programmes is outlined and costed. We found that the annualised benefits of BVDV eradication in Ireland exceeded the costs by a factor of 5 in the beef suckler sector and a factor of 14 in the dairy sector. Corresponding payback periods were 1. 2 and 0. 5 [*]years respectively. These results highlight the significant economic impact of BVDV on the Irish cattle industry and suggest a clear economic benefit to eradication using the proposed approach. This type of cost-benefit analysis is considered an essential prerequisite prior to undertaking an eradication campaign of this magnitude. peer-reviewe...|$|R
30|$|Upland farm cattle are {{predominantly}} <b>suckler</b> cow <b>herds</b> {{which are used}} to produce beef calves. While the hardy breeding animals can graze the moor all year-round, their progeny will usually graze the hills only during the summer, and in winter they will be moved down to lower-lying pastures, prior to sale off the holding or recruitment into the breeding flock or herd, in the following year. Commonly, grazing land for these young stock was provided on upland dairy farms often located in the valley bottoms, where the milking herd was generally kept indoors through the winter.|$|R
30|$|The German Environment Agency {{initiated}} {{a project to}} elucidate the entry of PCBs and PCDD/Fs in food related to environmental contamination. This paper summarizes the most important findings. Food products from farm animals sensitive to dioxin/PCB exposure—suckling calves and laying hens housed outdoor—can exceed EU maximum levels at soil concentrations that have previously been considered as safe. Maximum permitted levels can already be exceeded in beef/veal when soil is contaminated around 5  ng PCB-TEQ/kg dry matter (dm). For eggs/broiler, this can occur at a concentration of PCDD/Fs in soil below 5  ng PCDD/F–PCB-TEQ/kg dm. Egg consumers—especially young children—can easily exceed health-based guidance values (TDI). The soil–chicken egg exposure pathway {{is probably the most}} sensitive route for human exposure to both dl-PCBs and PCDD/Fs from soil and needs to be considered for soil guidelines. The study also found that calves from <b>suckler</b> cow <b>herds</b> are most prone to the impacts of dl-PCB contamination due to the excretion/accumulation via milk. PCB (and PCDD/F) intake for free-range cattle stems from feed and soil. Daily dl-PCB intake for <b>suckler</b> cow <b>herds</b> must in average be less than 2  ng PCB-TEQ/day. This translates to a maximum concentration in grass of 0.2  ng PCB-TEQ/kg dm which is less than 1 / 6 of the current EU maximum permitted level. This review compiles sources for PCDD/Fs and PCBs relevant to environmental contamination in respect to food safety. It also includes considerations on assessment of emerging POPs.|$|R
40|$|Body weights on 90 ± 45 {{days and}} 205 ± 45 days are body weights used for {{selection}} in <b>suckler</b> <b>herds,</b> likewise body weight on 365 ± 45 days {{are used for}} selection in performance test according to the Slovenian rules for recording in animal production, {{which is based on}} the International Committee for Animal Recording - ICAR. Dilemma which body weights are more suitable: the actual, or the adjusted ones at the recommended age of calves is often present. Comparison between fixed effects on actual and on adjusted 90 -day, 205 -day and 365 -day weights of Charolais calves have been studied. Calves (320) were born from 1995 to 2005 on Educational and Research Animal Husbandry Centre Logatec (Slovenia). Fixed effects of sex, parity, year of birth and birth weight were included in a model for the actual and adjusted body weights. Birth weight was included as linear regression. It has been concluded that parameters affected the actual body weights affected adjusted body weights, too. Birth weight and year of birth influenced 90 -day, 205 -day and 365 -day weight. Parity influenced only 90 -day weight, while sex influenced 205 -day and 365 -day weight. Coefficients of determination for adjusted 90 -day weight (0. 38), 205 -day weight (0. 38) and 365 -day weight (0. 73) were higher than for actual body weights (0. 20, 0. 30 and 0. 60, respectively) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In {{order to}} {{study the effects of}} herbage {{allowance}} on cattle behaviour activities on the farm, some methodological aspects had to be defined. Two sets of observations have been conducted on farm using a beef <b>suckler</b> <b>herd</b> containing 24 cows and managed in a rotational grazing system in-cluding a total of 6 paddocks. Behaviour activities were recorded on two successive paddocks. In set 1, the herd activities were recorded every 5 min in daylight and 15 min at night for the first two days on the two paddocks. In set 2, ten cows were individually identified among the same herd. On the first and the last day on the two paddocks, daylight activities were recorded with 5 -min frequencies. From these individual observations, total grazing and ruminating duration were calculated, simulating re-cords every 5, 10, 15 and 20 min. In set 1, 76 % of the total grazing and 28 % of the total ruminating ac-tivities occurred in daylight. Grazing started at dawn and finished at dusk. In set 2, grazing activity followed the same pattern as in set 1 in daylight. Whatever the frequency of the records, grazing and ruminating time were not significantly (P> 0. 05) different. However the 10 min frequency gave fewer and lower individual differences than the 15 and 20 min frequencies, compared to the original record (5 min). It is concluded that visual observations of cattle managed in a rotational grazing sys-tem can be readily undertaken at the farm level with 5 to 20 min frequencies...|$|R
40|$|Bachelor's {{thesis is}} focused on the {{comparison}} of the economics of Czech Red cattle (School Agriculture Company Haklovy Dvory) <b>suckler</b> <b>herd</b> with selected beef breeds (Aberdeen Angus and Limousine). Companies with identical and comparable rearing conditions natural breeding, systematical using of pasture possibilities, carrying out meat performance recordings, batch calf rearing and similar sea level etc., were compared. Main product of these companies is feeder cattle. Two factors affect realization of feeder cattle. The first one is its weight and second one is price per kilogram of live weight. It was found, that average daily gain was 1109 g and average weight 240 kg (210 days) of Czech Red cattle calves. In contrast, beef breed Aberdeen Angus reached 1402 g (P 0. 001) average daily gain and weight of 308 kg in 210 days (P 0. 001). Beef breed Limousine reached 1303 g average daily gain (P 0. 01) and average weight of 301 kg in same age (P 0. 001). The average price of Czech Red feeder cattle was around 50 Kč per kilogram, price of Aberdeen angus feeder cattle was 63 - 68 Kč per kilogram and price of Limousine feeder cattle was 73 - 83 Kč per kilogram of live weight. The differences were calculated in final prices and the subsidies (4, 000 Kč per heifer) were taken into account. According to this calculation rearing of Czech Red cattle and production of feeder cattle is still having a worse economic outcome (in average 4, 145 Kč (Aberdeen Angus) and 6, 401 Kč (Limousine) respectively), than beef breed as a result of lower daily weight gain and also lower price...|$|R
