Compared to the fusion welding processes that are routinely used for joining structural {{aluminium alloy}}s, friction stir welding (FSW) process is an emerging solid state joining {{process in which the}} material that is being welded does not melt and recast. This process uses a non-consumable tool to generate frictional heat in the abutting surfaces. The welding parameters and <b>tool</b> <b>pin</b> profile play major roles in deciding the weld quality. In this investigation, an attempt has been made to understand the effect of tool speed (rpm) and <b>tool</b> <b>pin</b> profile on Friction Stir Processing (FSP) zone formation in AA 5083 aluminium alloy. Friction stir welding between 5083 aluminium alloy plates with a thickness of 2. 5 mm was performed. Five different <b>tool</b> <b>pin</b> profiles (straight cylindrical, tapered cylindrical, triangular, square and cone) have been used to fabricate the joints at three different rotational speeds i. e. 900, 1400 and 1800 rpm under a constant traverse speed of 16 mm/min. The formation of FSP zone has been analysed macroscopically. Tensile properties of the joints have been evaluated and correlated with the FSP zone formation. From this investigation it has been found that the <b>tool</b> <b>pin</b> profiled designs had little effect on heat input and tensile properties, weld properties were dominated by thermal input rather than the mechanical deformation by the tool for the plate thickness of 2. 5 mm. straight cylindrical <b>pin</b> profiled <b>tool</b> produces mechanically sound and metallurgically defect free welds compared to other <b>tool</b> <b>pin</b> profiles.

40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) is a {{relatively}} new process being applied for joining of metal alloys. The process was initially developed by The Welding Institute (TWI) in Cambridge, UK. The FSW process is being investigated at NASA/MSEC as a repair/initial weld procedure for fabrication of the super-light-weight aluminum-lithium shuttle external tank. The FSW investigations at MSFC were conducted on a horizontal mill to produce butt welds of flat plate material. The weldment plates are butted together and fixed to a backing plate on the mill bed. A <b>pin</b> <b>tool</b> is placed into the tool holder of the mill spindle and rotated at approximately 400 rpm. The <b>pin</b> <b>tool</b> is then plunged into the plates such that the center of the probe lies at, one end of the line of contact, between the plates and the shoulder of the <b>pin</b> <b>tool</b> penetrates the top surface of the weldment. The weld is produced by traversing the tool along the line of contact between the plates. A lead angle allows {{the leading edge of the}} shoulder to remain above the top surface of the plate. The work presented here is the first attempt at modeling a complex phenomenon. The mechanical aspects of conducting the weld process are easily defined and the process itself is controlled by relatively few input parameters. However, in the region of the weld, plasticizing and forging of the parent material occurs. These are difficult processes to model. The model presented here addresses only variations in the radial dimension outward from the <b>pin</b> <b>tool</b> axis. Examinations of the grain structure of the weld reveal that a considerable amount of material deformation also occurs in the direction parallel to the <b>pin</b> <b>tool</b> axis of rotation, through the material thickness. In addition, measurements of the axial load on the <b>pin</b> <b>tool</b> demonstrate that the forging affect of the <b>pin</b> <b>tool</b> shoulder is an important process phenomenon. Therefore, the model needs to be expanded to account for the deformations through the material thickness and the forging affect of the shoulder. The energy balance at the boundary of the plastic region with the environment required that energy flow away from the boundary in both radial directions. One resolution to this problem may be to introduce a time dependency into the process model, allowing the energy flow to oscillate across this boundary. Finally, experimental measurements are needed to verify the concepts used here and to aid in improving the model...|$|E

40|$|Friction stir welding is an {{innovative}} weld process {{that continues to}} grow in use, in the commercial, defense, and space sectors. It produces high quality and high strength welds in aluminum alloys. The process consists of a rotating weld <b>pin</b> <b>tool</b> that plasticizes material through friction. The plasticized material is welded by applying a high weld forge force through the weld <b>pin</b> <b>tool</b> against the material during <b>pin</b> <b>tool</b> rotation. The high weld forge force is reacted against an anvil and a stout tool structure. A variation of friction stir welding currently being evaluated is self-reacting friction stir welding. Self-reacting friction stir welding incorporates two opposing shoulders on the crown and root sides of the weld joint. In self-reacting friction stir welding, the weld forge force is reacted against the crown shoulder portion of the weld <b>pin</b> <b>tool</b> by the root shoulder. This {{eliminates the need for}} a stout tooling structure to react the high weld forge force required in the typical friction stir weld process.

To evaluate the application of self-reacting friction stir welding for aluminum alloy circumferential welding, a feasibility study was performed.
