40|$|International audienceThe {{issue of}} {{polymers}} films and particles friction, damage and attrition attracts both {{scientific and technological}} interest. In fact, polymers friction and attrition are of pivotal importance in many technological domains and applications such as powder technology, processes in fluidized beds, materials handling and transport processing (e. g., screw, <b>pneumatic</b> and hydraulic <b>convey)</b> and biopolymers and polymers processing. Moreover, polymer damage (e. g., attrition) has harmful effects on product quality, on environmental and health safety (source of toxic dust) and on the process reliability because of changes in particle properties such as particle shape and size distribution. The present contribution {{will focus on the}} attrition analysis induced by the rub of hemispherical polystyrene particles against smooth and functionalized silicon walls. Several experimental and structural factors affecting attrition of polymeric particles such as the velocity, the applied normal force, polymer molecular weights, and the wall surface energy are discussed. A homemade device was used to carry out a single slide of the polystyrene hemispherical (4 nm radius) particle onto different silicon walls. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used so as to analyze the attrition appearance induced by the polymer damage. Nano-friction experiments were also achieved by AFM in lateral mode in order to distinguish the effect of interfacial interactions at the nanometric scale...|$|R

40|$|Of {{the various}} {{transition}} velocities that delineate flow regimes in multiphase <b>pneumatic</b> and hydraulic <b>conveying,</b> the critical deposition velocity {{is important because}} it separates depositing and non-depositing flows. However, no distinction has been made between the dependence of the critical deposition velocity on physical parameters and flow conditions at low solid volume fractions and in the limit of zero volume fraction, which are distinct mathematically. Here, the two cases are analysed separately, and a general functional form in terms of the particle Reynolds number and Archimedes number is proposed that is valid up to volume fractions of several per cent. An ultrasonic method for determining the critical value of the particle Reynolds number is presented, and results for four particle types at several nominal volume fractions (0. 5, 1 and 3 % by volume) are combined with a number of data from the literature. The resulting expressions are found to compare well with several similar correlations for the critical deposition velocity and other transition velocities, and, unlike a recent best-fit approach for the pick-up velocity, incorporate an explicit dependence on volume fraction, to which the critical deposition velocity is most sensitive at very low volume fractions. Lastly, it is found that the functional forms for the critical deposition velocity in the literature are unable to reproduce the available data at higher volume fractions, and a number of suggestions are made for resolving this issue...|$|R
40|$|Excavating and {{transporting}} planetary regolith {{are examples}} of surface activities that may occur during a future space exploration mission to a planetary body. Regolith, whether it is collected on the Moon, Mars or even an asteroid, consists of granular minerals, {{some of which have}} been identified to be viable resources that can be mined and processed chemically to extract useful by-products, such as oxygen, water, and various metals and metal alloys. Even the depleted "waste" material from such chemical processes may be utilized later in the construction of landing pads and protective structures at the site of a planetary base. One reason for excavating and conveying planetary regolith is to deliver raw regolith material to in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) systems. The goal of ISRU is to provide expendable supplies and materials at the planetary destination, if possible. An in-situ capability of producing mission-critical substances such as oxygen will help to extend the mission and its success, and will greatly lower the overall cost of a mission by either eliminating, or significantly reducing, the need to transport the same expendable materials from the Earth. In order to support the goals and objectives of present and future ISRU projects, NASA seeks technology advancements in the areas of regolith conveying. Such systems must be effective, efficient and provide reliable performance over long durations while being exposed to the harsh environments found on planetary surfaces. These conditions include contact with very abrasive regolith particulates, exposure to high vacuum or dry (partial) atmospheres, wide variations in temperature, reduced gravity, and exposure to space radiation. Regolith conveying techniques that combine reduced failure modes and low energy consumption with high material transfer rates will provide significant value for future space exploration missions to the surfaces of the moon, Mars and asteroids. <b>Pneumatic</b> regolith <b>conveying</b> has demonstrated itself to be a viable delivery system through testing under terrestrial and reduced gravity conditions in recent years. Modeling and experimental testing have been conducted at NASA Kennedy Space Center to study and advance pneumatic planetary regolith delivery systems in support of NASA's ISRU project. The goal of this work is to use the model to predict solid-gas flow patterns in reduced gravity environments for ISRU inlet gas line allowing the eductor inlet gas flow to vary and depend on the flow pattern developed at the eductor as inferred by the experimental observations...|$|R
