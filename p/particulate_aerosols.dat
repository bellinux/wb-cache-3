This technique uses a supervised texture classication approach, and utilises data from two distinct satellite sources. The vertical feature mask (VFM) product from the CALIPSO lidar, provides an accurate description of the aerosol content of the atmosphere but has a limited footprint and coverage. The CALIPSO VFM is used to provide training data in order to for classiers {{to be applied to}} other imagery, namely data from the spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager (SEVIRI) on the MSG satellite. The output from the classication is a 2 D mask representing the locations of the <b>particulate</b> <b>aerosol</b> of interest within the SEVIRI image. This approach has been demonstrated on test cases over land and ocean, and shows a good agreement with other techniques for the detection of <b>particulate</b> <b>aerosol.</b> However, the supervised texture approach provides outputs at a higher resolution than the existing methods and the same approach is applicable over land and ocean and therefore shows the advantages compared to the current techniques. Furthermore, the coverage of the approach can be further extended using signature extension and chain classication. Signature extension was applied to one of the test cases to monitor the same geographical region with temporal extension away from the initial supervised classication. The experiments showed {{that it was possible to}} extend the coverage for ± 90 minutes from the original classication and indicates the possibility of greater extension over larger temporal windows.

Objective To determine the processes by which birch pollen allergens become airborne particles of respirable size {{with the potential to}} contribute to airways inflammation. Methods Branches with attached male catkins were harvested and placed in a controlled emission chamber. Filtered dry air was passed through the chamber until the anthers opened, then they were humidified for 5 h and air-dried again. Flowers were disturbed by wind generated from a small electric fan. Released particles were counted, measured and collected for immuno-labelling and high-resolution microscopy. Results Birch pollen remains on the dehisced anther and can rupture in high humidity and moisture. Fresh pollen takes as long as 3 h to rupture in water.

40|$|The {{transport}} of particulate matter across a planets surface {{is a powerful}} erosion mechanism and a significant factor affecting atmospheric dynamics by the creation of <b>particulate</b> <b>aerosols.</b> In this sense Mars is a test bed {{for the study of}} dust aerosols since it lacks the active circulation of water through the atmosphere, as we see on earth. Dust transport has therefore become the dominant process on Mars for both atmospheric contamination and evolution of the surface. Laboratory simulations have shown that dust electrification and aggregation is crucial to the {{transport of}} dust on Mars [1, 2].

40|$|Barriers to {{effective}} pulmonary drug delivery are inherent to the lung physiology and present a challenge {{when attempting to}} bypass the natural defenses against inhaled particles. Inhaled <b>particulate</b> <b>aerosols</b> that deposit in the conducting airways of the lungs can become trapped in the respiratory mucus layer where they are then subjected to rapid clearance by the mucociliary escalator. The details of particle behavior after deposition and before this clearance are not well understood, however. Several physical processes may influence particle behavior on the mucus, including a penetration of particles into the mucus layer or a lateral transport of particles across the lung surface. Particles which deposit onto the respiratory mucus are subject {{to a number of}} forces which dictate these behaviors in the lung and may influence the retention of particles in the lungs and the efficacy of pulmonary drug delivery. The goal of this thesis was to investigate the behavior of microparticles deposited on a synthetic mucus model designed to mimic the bulk viscoelastic and surface tension properties of conducting airway mucus. Studies were conducted {{to determine the effects of}} mucus surface properties and particle physicochemical properties on the submersion and lateral mobility of single particles and the spreadability of particle-laden droplets at the air-liquid interface. Synthetic mucus gels were developed with viscoelastic properties that mimicked those of non-diseased tracheobronchial mucus. Infasurf, a calf lung surfactant extract, was spread onto the gel surfaces and compressed in a Langmuir trough to attain physiologically relevant surface tensions (~ 30 - 34 mN/m) and to analyze surfactant behavior on viscoelastic subphases. Microparticles were aerosolized onto the model mucus surface and imaged by brightfield microscopy at varying surface tensions on gels of varying viscoelastic properties to determine the extent of capillary submersion, in the fluid interface. Lateral transport of microparticles across the surfactant interface was quantified using particle tracking techniques. Finally, the spreading patterns of surfactant-laden droplets containing model drugs or particles were monitored by time-course imaging. Studies revealed that key physicochemical properties, including particle size and hydrophobicity, influenced particle submersion and mobility on the mimetic surfaces. Submersion, transport, and droplet spreadability were all inhibited with increasing gel viscoelastic properties, suggesting that such inhibition would be expected by healthy or disease tracheobronchial mucus. While low surface tensions promoted microparticle submersion into the subphase, the lateral transport and droplet spreadability were inhibited on gels with pre-existing surfactant films. The extent of droplet spreading could be enhanced by adding surfactant to the droplets. Overall, these studies aid our understanding of particle behavior and their fate at lung-like fluid surfaces, which has implications for both pulmonary drug delivery and pulmonary toxicity. <b>Particulate</b> <b>aerosols</b> which are designed to be smaller and more hydrophilic would experience improved mobility in the lungs and potentially gain the ability to submerge through the thick and highly viscous mucus barriers of diseased lungs. In healthy lungs, improved submersion could lead to greater particle retention, reduced mucociliary clearance, and a more effective delivery of drug to the epithelium. Lastly, by adding surfactant to drug containing liquid aerosol droplets, the deposition and distribution of drug could be improved in the peripheral regions of the obstructed lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. Results from these studies provide new knowledge that can be used to predict the behavior of aerosols deposited in the lungs and can aid the design of aerosols for drug delivery applications...|$|E
40|$|Numerous authors {{investigating}} {{respiratory tract}} penetration by air particulate pollutants {{have recognized the}} relationship existing between particle size and lung penetration. Morton (1956) concluded that the particle size of an aerosol of pathogenic organisms determines the degree of infectivity by the respiratory route. Druet et al. (1953) stated that infectivity is greatest with sinigle spore particles and falls off sharply with particles larger than 5 microns. Harper and Morton (1953) said that few particles larger than 4 microns reach the lungs. Brown et al. (1950) summarized the theoretical and experimental findings on respiratory tract pene-tration. They stated that nasal efficiency for screening out airborne particles entering the respiratory tract is practically 100 per cent for particles above 5 microns and decreases with particle size to zero for 1 micron particles; that depth of penetration into the respiratory tract increases with decreasing size; that alveolar retention is complete for particles larger than 1 micron which escape being trapped in the upper respiratory tract; and that from 1 to}E micron, alveolar retention decreases.

We found a clear difference in chemical composition between the continentally affected and marine background air masses over the observation site. Asian continental air masses are delivered from late autumn to spring, whereas marine air masses were dominated in summer. Concentrations of non-sea salt (nss-) SO 4 2 −, NO 3 −, NH 4 +, nss-K + and nss-Ca 2 + are high in winter and spring and low in summer. On the other hand, MSA − (methanesulfonate) exhibits higher concentrations during spring and winter, probably due to springtime dust bloom or due to the direct continental transport of MSA − to the observation site. We could not find any clear decadal trend for Na +, Cl −, Mg 2 + and nss-Ca 2 + in all seasons, although there exists a clear seasonal trend. However, concentrations of nss-SO 4 2 − continuously decreased from 2007 to 2012, {{probably due to the}} decreased SO 2 emissions in East Asia especially in China. In contrast, nss-K + and MSA − concentrations continuously increased from 2001 to 2012 during winter and spring seasons, demonstrating that biomass burning and/or terrestrial biological emissions in East Asia are being increasingly transported from the Asian continent to the western North Pacific.

Current weather and climate models struggle to realistically represent the development and behavior of these clouds. Both the timing of the convection and the role of humidity in the environment are often poorly represented in these models. In this thesis, detailed numerical simulations serve as a virtual laboratory where the influence of the environment on cloud formation is investigated. The evaporation of rain is shown to result in a positive feedback loop that causes the clouds to become wider and deeper. These wider and deeper clouds tend to form at preferential locations. Subsequently, the relative influence of the temperature profile and humidity in the environment is systematically explored. A simple model captures the response of the clouds to these conditions. Flow trajectories are used to investigate the mixing between the clouds and their environment in more detail. These trajectories show that in essence clouds consist of rising air that mixes horizontally with the environment.

Measured values varied depending on the locations of the sites in Spain and their respective climatic characteristics. 134 Cs, 136 Cs, 137 Cs, 131 I, and 132 Te activity concentrations in filter samples were studied and associated levels of 131 I fallout were estimated from wet and dry deposition. <b>Particulate</b> <b>aerosol</b> activity concentrations ranges, in mBq/m 3, were 1. 63 e 3080 (131 I), 2. 8 e 690 (137 Cs), 1. 3 e 620 (134 Cs) and 3. 6 e 330 (132 Te), while the associated 131 I fallout was roughly estimated to be less than 20 Bq/m 2, Gaseous 131 I was also detected and the 131 I-gaseous/ 131 I-total ratio increased at the three stations from approximately 0. 75 at the end of March to 0. 85 e 0. 9 during {{the first few days of}} April. Finally, the presence of 131 I in some crucial parts of the food chain was also studied. 131 I was detected in samples from goat’s and cow’s milk (maximum levels of 1. 11 Bq/L) and in broadleaf plants (maximum level 1. 42 Bq/kg).
