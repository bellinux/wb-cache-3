40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to solve the problem {{connected}} with development of theoretical and methodological provisions of formation of the assessment procedure of organizational resources of the <b>productive</b> <b>activity.</b> Theoretical results of our research are: improvement of the concept of development of organizational resources of the productive activity; identifying the impact of organizational resources on the productive activity; justification of the basic principles of formation of the assessment system of efficiency of the organizational resources' use. We proposed a unified methodological approach allowing to combine the complexity of assessment of both quantity of core resources of the <b>productive</b> <b>activity</b> and organizational resources, which significantly develops traditional systems of the <b>productive</b> <b>activity</b> management based on identifying quantitative parameters of the subsystems, their assessment, comparison and analysis. We also substantiated our opinion on assessment of organizational resources' values. It is focused on the development of the <b>productive</b> <b>activity</b> and allows to use the developed tools of the methodological approach for forecast assessment of the impact of the quantity of core resources, used in the <b>productive</b> <b>activity,</b> and organizational resources of the <b>productive</b> <b>activity</b> on the economic results of the enterprise...|$|R

25|$|Our oldest {{citation}} for otium is this {{chorus of}} soldiers, singing about idleness on campaign, {{in an otherwise}} lost Latin tragedy by Ennius. Andre shows in these lines that Ennius is showing the soldiers in the field would rather go home tending to their own affairs (otium) than to be idle doing nothing. Its military origin meant to stop fighting in battle and laying down of the weapons - a time for peace. Even though originally otium was a military concept in early Roman culture of laying down one's weapons, it later became an elite prestigious time for caring for onesself. The ancient Romans {{had a sense of}} obligatory work ethics in their culture and considered the idle-leisure definition of otium as a waste of time. Historians of ancient Roman considered otium a time of laborious leisure of much personal duties instead of public duties. Author Almasi shows that historians Jean-Marie Andre and Brian Vickers point out the only legitimate form of otium was transpired with intellectual activity. Otium was thought of by the wise elite as being free from work and other obligations (negotium) and leisure time spent on <b>productive</b> <b>activities,</b> however a time that should not be wasted as was thought the non-elite did with their leisure time.|$|E

500|$|Domestic work is {{maintenance}} of the home, and is usually universally recognizable, e.g. doing the laundry.

Care work also involves [...] "close personal or emotional interaction." [...] Also included in this category is [...] "self-care," [...] in which leisure time and activities are included.

2500|$|In {{some ways}} like beavers as they {{construct}} their dams, humans have always engaged in niche construction, creating novel environments {{to which they}} subsequently become adapted.

2500|$|Simple {{commodity}} production (also {{known as}} [...] "petty commodity production") {{is a term}} coined by Frederick Engels to describe <b>productive</b> <b>activities</b> under the conditions of what Marx had called the [...] "simple exchange" [...] of commodities, where independent producers such as peasants trade their own products. The {{use of the word}} [...] "simple" [...] does not refer {{to the nature of the}} producers or of their production, but to the relatively simple and straightforward exchange processes involved. Simple commodity production is compatible with many different relations of production, ranging from self-employment where the producer owns his means of production, and family labour, to forms of slavery, peonage, indentured labour, and serfdom.|$|E

2500|$|The term {{child labour}} can be {{misleading}} when it confuses harmful work with employment that may be beneficial to children. It can also ignore harmful work outside employment and any benefits children normally derive from their work. [...] Domestic work is an example: all families but the rich must work at cleaning, cooking, caring, and more to maintain their homes. In most families in the world, this process extends to <b>productive</b> <b>activities,</b> especially herding and various types of agriculture, [...] and {{to a variety of}} small family businesses. Where trading is a significant feature of social life, children can start trading in small items at an early age, often in the company of family members or of peers.|$|E
2500|$|On an {{international}} scale, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) have begun focusing on labour environments {{in developing nations}} with projects such as Healthy Cities. Many of these developing countries are stuck in {{a situation in which}} their relative lack of resources to invest in OSH leads to increased costs due to work-related illnesses and accidents. As a 2007 Factsheet from the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work states: [...] "Countries with less developed OSH systems spend a far higher percentage of GDP on work-related injury and illness – taking resources away from more <b>productive</b> <b>activities...</b> The ILO estimates that work-related illness and accidents cost up to 10% of GDP in Latin America, compared with just 2.6% to 3.8% in the EU."

2500|$|In {{advanced}} capitalist societies {{such as the}} United States, {{the stock}} of constant capital applied in private sector <b>productive</b> <b>activities</b> represents only about 20–30% {{of the value of}} the total physical capital stock, and perhaps 10–12% of total capital assets owned, and therefore it is unlikely that a fall in the industrial rate of profit could by itself explain economic crises. Marxists ignored this reality, because they tacitly assumed in their economic model that the economy consists just of factories, and that Marx's analysis of the capitalist mode of production was a complete analysis of the whole economy, which is not true. For example, the famous Marxist scholar David Harvey claims that [...] "Money, land, real estate and plant and equipment that are not being used productively are not capital". In his original 2001 Phd thesis in economics, the leading Dutch Marxist Robert Went borrows an idea from Christian Palloix, and transplants the categories of Capital, Volume II summarily to the whole world economy. Went claims that there exist only three circuits of capital (commodity capital, money capital and production capital), even although, according to Marx himself, these circuits refer only to the capitalist mode of production. In Japan, Kozo Uno equated Marx's theory of the capitalist mode of production with the theory of capitalist society.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between money growth, inflation, and <b>productive</b> <b>activity</b> in a general equilibrium model of search. The use of a multiple-matching technique, where trade frictions are captured by limited consumption variety, allows us to study price determination in a search-theoretic environment with divisible money and goods. In our basic framework, <b>productive</b> <b>activity</b> and matching in the goods market are endogenized by a time allocation decision of work and shopping effort. We find that in such an environment, a positive feedback between shopping and work effort decisions creates a channel by which inflation can positively influence <b>productive</b> <b>activity.</b> This feature also creates the possibility of multiple steady state equilibria when household preferences for variety is sufficiently great. We also consider an alternative means of endogenizing the matching technology through endogenous firm entry. Consistent {{with the findings of}} our basic framework, the importance of search frictions continues to be essential for the non-uniqueness of equilibria and an additional channel which links money growth to real activity.

2500|$|Set in the interwar period, Revelion {{introduces}} the character Gabriel Dimancea, a schoolteacher, journalist, aspiring novelist and World War I veteran who is {{absorbed by the}} fate of his fellow human beings. Dimancea is also the protagonist of Vara baroc, a volume identified by Dan C. Mihăilescu as the second [...] "peak" [...] among Georgescu's contributions. In this narrative, the protagonist's dreams of social revolution contrast with the immovability and apathy induced by the intense summer heat of Platoneşti, a fictional town in the Bărăgan Plain. According to Ion Simuţ, the volume ranks with other [...] "epic episodes set against the Dog Days", in novels by [...] "Wallachian" [...] southerners: Agopian, Ştefan Bănulescu, Fănuş Neagu, Marin Preda, Nicolae Velea. Simuţ likens the narrative to Ivan Goncharov's classic work, Oblomov, noting in particular Dimancea's refusal to engage in <b>productive</b> <b>activities,</b> his wantonness, and belief that sexual intercourse is too tiresome; however: [...] "Gabriel Dimancea does not, after all, evolve {{in the sense of}} Goncharov's character, because he fights against himself. He becomes the intellectual of frustrated revolt, enduring only as a project—a revolt frustrated by the adverse meteorology. One could say—exaggerating a little, for the sake of paraphrase—that his revolution (interior and social) is postponed by the torpor." [...] This process is reflected in Dimancea's conversations with estate leaseholder Maltezi, whose steady questioning of the schoolteacher's revolutionary ideas and repeated distractions contribute to Dimancea's growing acceptance of inactivity, failure and moral dissolution. Against the summer-enhanced steadiness of regular life in the Kingdom of Romania, the novel sets the rising threat of fascism, depicting in particular Dimancea's growing fear toward the political agitator Corneliu Zelea Codreanu and his embryonic Iron Guard. Simuţ believes the events in the novel may refer to 1926, the [...] "political parenthesis" [...] between National Liberal regimes, when the People's Party of Alexandru Averescu confronts the National Peasantist opposition.|$|E
