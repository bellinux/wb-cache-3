5|$|Forest Hill {{was a new}} air base, {{and roads}} and {{buildings}} were still under construction when its first course of flying training commenced with Avro Ansons on 29July 1940. One of the Ansons crashed in August, killing its instructor and a student. Later that month the second flying course began, on CAC Wirraways. The school was then reorganised into Initial and Advanced Squadrons. On 29September, two Ansons collided in mid-air and became locked together. Both navigators bailed out, to be followed shortly afterwards by the injured <b>pilot</b> <b>of</b> the lower aircraft. The <b>pilot</b> <b>of</b> the upper Anson, however, {{found that he was}} able to control the interlocked aircraft using his ailerons and flaps, coupled with the engine power of the Anson underneath. He then managed to make a successful emergency landing in a paddock near the town of Brocklesby.|$|E
