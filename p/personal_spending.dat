25|$|Unlike his predecessors, Aurangzeb {{considered}} the royal treasury {{to be held}} in trust for the citizens of his empire. He made caps and copied the Quran to earn money for his use,. Aurangzeb constructed a small marble mosque known as the Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque) in the Red Fort complex in Delhi. However, his constant warfare, especially with the Marathas, drove his empire to the brink of bankruptcy just as much as the wasteful <b>personal</b> <b>spending</b> and opulence of his predecessors. Aurangzeb knew he would not return to the throne after his final campaign against the Marathas in 1706, in which he was joined by newly emerging commanders in the Mughal army such as Syed Hassan Ali Khan Barha, Saadat Ali Khan and Asaf Jah I, and Daud Khan.|$|E

25|$|During {{his first}} administration, Johnson was embroiled in several {{personal}} scandals. After {{moving to a}} new house in Islington, he built a shed on his balcony without obtaining planning permission; after neighbours complained, he dismantled the shed. The press also accused him of {{having an affair with}} Helen Macintyre and of fathering her child, allegations that he did not deny. Controversy was generated when Johnson was accused of warning the MP Damian Green that police were planning to arrest him; Johnson denied the claims and did not face criminal charges under the Criminal Justice Act. He was accused of cronyism, in particular for appointing Veronica Wadley, a former Evening Standard editor who had supported him, as the chair of London's Arts Council when she was widely regarded as not being the best candidate for the position. He was caught up in the parliamentary expenses scandal and accused of excessive <b>personal</b> <b>spending</b> on taxi journeys, with his deputy mayor Ian Clement having been found to have misused a City Hall credit card, resulting in his resignation.|$|E
2500|$|Bartle was a hail-fellow-well-met, who [...] "never knew a stranger" [...] and {{demonstrated}} an impressive recall of names. [...] On Christmas, he would regularly {{spend the day}} visiting orphanages, the Boy's Home, the city jail, and other places that might be overlooked on such a holiday. For most of his life, Bartle lived simply, becoming more expansive in his <b>personal</b> <b>spending</b> only after being elected mayor. (His greatest extravagance until that point was fine cigars, of which he smoked 25 per day.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{health of}} the beauty {{industry}} declined in the 1970s, as the growth of cosmetics sales failed {{to keep pace with}} overall growth in <b>personal</b> <b>spending.</b> The industry, according to a 1979 article in W magazine, had [...] "lost its glamour". Rather than developing innovative products, many companies had depended on price increases for profitability. Consumers considered cosmetics companies outdated, uncreative, and dogmatic, and manufacturers received negative publicity regarding the safety of cosmetics ingredients, animal testing, microbial contamination, and the possibility of acne caused by cosmetics.|$|E

2500|$|Social {{spending}} was dramatically increased, particularly for housing, education, and health, while {{a major effort}} was made to redistribute wealth to poorer Chileans. As a result of new initiatives in nutrition and health, together with higher wages, many poorer Chileans were able to feed themselves and clothe themselves better than they had been able to before. Public access to the social security system was increased, while state benefits such as family allowances were raised significantly. The redistribution of income enabled wage and salary earners to increase their share of national income from 51.6% (the annual average between 1965 and 1970) to 65% while family consumption increased by 12.9% {{in the first year of}} the Allende Government. In addition, while the average annual increase in <b>personal</b> <b>spending</b> had been 4.8% in the period 1965–70, it reached 11.9% in 1971. During the first two years of Allende’s presidency, state expenditure on health rose from around 2% to nearly 3.5% of GDP. According to Jennifer E. Pribble, this new spending [...] "was reflected not only in public health campaigns, but also in the construction of health infrastructure". Small programs targeted at women were also experimented with, such as cooperative laundries and communal food preparation, together with an expansion of child-care facilities.|$|E
2500|$|The {{economics}} of Christmas {{is significant because}} Christmas is typically a peak selling season for retailers in many nations around the world. Sales increase dramatically as people purchase gifts, decorations, and supplies to celebrate. In the U.S., the [...] "Christmas shopping season" [...] starts as early as October. In Canada, merchants begin advertising campaigns just before Halloween (October 31), and step up their marketing following Remembrance Day on November 11. In the UK and Ireland, the Christmas shopping season starts from mid November, around the time when high street Christmas lights are turned on. In the United States, it has been calculated that {{a quarter of all}} <b>personal</b> <b>spending</b> takes place during the Christmas/holiday shopping season. Figures from the U.S. Census Bureau reveal that expenditure in department stores nationwide rose from $20.8 billion in November 2004 to $31.9 billion in December 2004, an increase of 54 percent. In other sectors, the pre-Christmas increase in spending was even greater, there being a November–December buying surge of 100 percent in bookstores and 170 percent in jewelry stores. In the same year employment in American retail stores rose from 1.6 million to 1.8 million in the two months leading up to Christmas. Industries completely dependent on Christmas include Christmas cards, of which 1.9 billion are sent in the United States each year, and live Christmas Trees, of which 20.8 million were cut in the U.S. in 2002. In the UK in 2010, up to £8 billion was expected to be spent online at Christmas, approximately a quarter of total retail festive sales.|$|E
60|$|Which is more {{difficult}} than it sounds. Let me show you, {{at the expense of}} a slight going aside. Louis did not know girls in their home life. He had the entree to no girl's home. And of course, I, a stranger in this new world, was similarly circumstanced. But, further, Louis and I were unable to go to dancing-schools, or to public dances, which were very good places for getting acquainted. We didn't have the money. He was a blacksmith's apprentice, and was earning but slightly more than I. We both lived at home and paid our way. When we had done this, and bought our cigarettes, and the inevitable clothes and shoes, there remained to each of us, for <b>personal</b> <b>spending,</b> a sum that varied between seventy cents and a dollar for the week. We whacked this up, shared it, and sometimes loaned all of what was left of it when one of us needed it for some more gorgeous girl-adventure, such as car-fare out to Blair's Park and back--twenty cents, bang, just like that; and ice-cream for two--thirty cents; or tamales in a tamale-parlour, which came cheaper and which for two cost only twenty cents.|$|E

40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) is {{a costly}} disease that causes much {{morbidity}} and mortality in the world, {{and it was the}} sixth leading cause of disability in developed countries. We aim to study the utilization pattern of alternative therapies and their effects on quality of life and <b>personal</b> health <b>spending</b> in Chinese OA patients in Hong Kong. Five-hundred forty-seven patients with OA from four regional hospitals in Hong Kong were recruited, and we measured various types of alternative therapies, SF- 36 scales, an overall Health Utility Index derived from a pre-scored multi-attribute classification system based upon SF- 36 health surveys, health spending per person and out-of-pocket payments and side-effects. The study shows that out of the 547 OA patients, the patients have used a wide spectrum of alternative therapies and often used a multiplicity of them. Payment for alternative therapies constitutes 5 % of the overall <b>personal</b> healthcare <b>spending,</b> and 29 % of the out-of-pocket payments. The use of alternative therapies was significantly associated with higher <b>personal</b> healthcare <b>spending</b> (p = 0. 01), after adjusting for socioeconomic variables, years of OA and severity of OA. The use of alternative therapies was not significantly associated with an improvement in {{the quality of life in}} the regression analysis (p = 0. 64). The use of alternative therapies was statistically significant associated with the side effects, including gastric discomfort and gastric ulcer/bleeding (p = 0. 04, 0. 02, respectively). Alternative therapies were used extensively by OA patients in Hong Kong. Clinicians, health policy makers, and insurance carriers should be aware of the potential health and economic effects in practice and policy formulation. © 2007 World Scientific Publishing Company Institute for Advanced Research in Asian Science and Medicine. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|In economics, the {{marginal}} {{propensity to consume}} (MPC) is a metric that quantifies induced consumption, the concept {{that the increase in}} <b>personal</b> consumer <b>spending</b> (consumption) occurs with an increase in disposable income (income after taxes and transfers). The proportion of disposable income which individuals spend on consumption is known as propensity to consume. MPC is the proportion of additional income that an individual consumes. For example, if a household earns one extra dollar of disposable income, and {{the marginal}} propensity to consume is 0.65, then of that dollar, the household will spend 65 cents and save 35 cents. Obviously, the household cannot spend more than the extra dollar (without borrowing).|$|R
50|$|Kleptocracies are {{generally}} associated with dictatorships, oligarchies, military juntas, {{or other forms}} of autocratic and nepotist governments in which external oversight is impossible or does not exist. This lack of oversight can be caused or exacerbated by the ability of the kleptocratic officials to control both the supply of public funds and the means of disbursal for those funds. Kleptocratic rulers often treat their country's treasury as a source of <b>personal</b> wealth, <b>spending</b> funds on luxury goods and extravagances as they see fit. Many kleptocratic rulers secretly transfer public funds into hidden personal numbered bank accounts in foreign countries to provide for themselves if removed from power.|$|R
