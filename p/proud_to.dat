She sues for sex discrimination and Kenny's promotion is reversed. She tells Kenny that she would be <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> serve under him but tells Sheriff Brock that his blatant bigotry has made her less <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> serve under him.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the view}} that is {{widespread}} among the Russian music public, I am associated with the party that is antagonistic to the one living Russian composer I love and value above all others—Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.... In a word, despite our different musical identities, it would seem we are following a single path; and I, for my part, am <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> have such a fellow traveler.... Lyadov and Glazunov are also numbered among my opponents, yet I sincerely love and value their talent.|$|E
5|$|However, {{he still}} {{preferred}} Arabic authors more than Persian ones. There {{is very little}} evidence which shows his interest in Persian poetry. He spoke Arabic, wrote in Arabic and was <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> be a student of a famous Arab grammarian. He studied science in Arabic, including astronomy and mathematics. Many books written in Arabic were dedicated to him whether religious or secular content. Apparently showing interest in Arabic rather than Persian, Adud al-Dawla followed the mainstream of intellectual life in a provincial town where culture was dominated by Arabic and Persian.|$|E

The team was British (having been founded by a New Zealander), the tyres were American Goodyears, the TAG-Porsche engine was German, the chassis itself was built by Hercules Aerospace in the USA, and was sponsored by an American tobacco company (Marlboro) and the Saudi Arabian owned company Techniques d'Avant Garde (TAG).|$|E

Dunga is attracted to Wellington, a butcher who delivers meat to the hotel. Wellington, however, is married to Kika, a woman who is <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> be an evangelical Christian. However, Wellington cheats on his wife with a woman named Dayse. Dayse tires of being Wellington's mistress and tells Dunga about the relationship.|$|E

5|$|Adler was {{not content}} to {{continue}} long in this mode, and sought a playwright who could create pieces that would appeal to the Jewish public, while still providing a type of theater he could be <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> perform. He recruited Jacob Gordin, already a well-respected novelist and intellectual, recently arrived in New York and eking out {{a living as a}} journalist at the Arbeiter Zeitung, precursor to The Forward. Gordin's first two plays, Siberia and Two Worlds were commercial failures—so much so that Mogulesko and Kessler quit the company—but The Yiddish King Lear, starring Adler and his new wife Sara was such a success that the play eventually transferred to Finkel's larger National Theater. This play (based only very loosely on Shakespeare) played well with the popular audience, but also with Jewish intellectuals who until this time had largely ignored Yiddish Theater, ending for a time the commercial dominance of operettas such as those of Horowitz and Joseph Lateiner. The next year, Gordin's The Wild Man solidified this change in the direction of Yiddish theater, which was entering what is retrospectively seen as its first period of greatness.|$|E
5|$|During a {{fundraising}} {{event in}} Russellville, Arkansas, Brightspirit's Mercy {{was performed by}} various high school drama students. The second of two plays by Erin Hunter, Brightspirit's Mercy is about Jaypaw, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf. After going to a Gathering, where it is obvious all of the Clans except for ThunderClan are starving, three cats from StarClan appear to them: Brightspirit and her parents, Shiningheart and Braveheart, characters created on Wands and Worlds, a fantasy fiction forum, in memory of a 10-year-old Warriors fan, Emmy Grace Cherry, and her parents, Dana and Jimmy Cherry, {{who were killed in}} a tornado in February 2007. They tell the three young cats that they must help feed the other Clans. Jaypaw is easily convinced, but Hollyleaf and Lionblaze are harder to win over. Eventually, they agree and hunt, then wait at the WindClan border for a patrol. Ashfoot, WindClan's deputy, accepts the gift, but Breezepaw, too <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> have help from another Clan, refuses to eat it. Jaypaw, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf then head towards another Clan's territory.|$|E
5|$|His signing by the Steelers {{caused a}} social media {{backlash}} by many Steeler fans, with some {{saying that they}} would never support the team again. Fans who supported or were indifferent about the signing called such fans fair weather fans, and also cited that the Steelers have several players with questionable pasts, most notably Roethlisberger and James Harrison. The Animal Rescue League of Western Pennsylvania made a subtle jab at the team on Twitter by saying that they were now more <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> support the Pittsburgh Penguins and subsequently moved an upcoming fundraiser event from Heinz Field to Consol Energy Center. Steelers president Art Rooney II defended the Vick signing on KDKA-TV, saying that they felt that Vick had proven himself since being released from prison. The Steelers had considered signing Vick in 2009—both Vick and Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin are from the same part of Virginia and know each other well personally—but decided against it due to potential backlash since Vick at the time hadn't proven himself following his release from prison.|$|E

5|$|Mount Saint Peter Church was {{magnificent}} {{and rose}} {{up on the}} hill, but to many, {{it seemed as if}} it could not really belong to the congregation. It was much richer than Saint Peter Church and {{if it had not been}} labored upon by so many members of the congregation, none would have felt worthy to call it their parish. But since so much work, love, and faith had been spent on this place of worship, parishioners became <b>proud</b> <b>to</b> have the honor of attending Mass there every Sunday. As a construction site, it had held some dangers. On September 28, 1941, a group of teenage boys, just out of high school, were making concrete flooring for the church at the Burrell Construction Company. A large crane operating above them made an unusual movement, causing its bucket, which weighed several tons, to come down with a huge crash right in their midst. All the working tools were completely destroyed but none of the boys were hurt. The bronze door at the front entrance fell on a worker, and everyone believed he had been crushed to death. When ten men lifted the door, they found the worker unharmed underneath it. In another case, an 18-year-old was assigned a job on the tower of the church before it was roofed. No one realized that he had poor eyesight and he fell from the tower while working. On his way down, he was able to grab onto a pulley that was suspended from the tower.|$|E
