40|$|The {{increased}} travelling {{of today}} makes nodes along travelling routes {{more and more}} important. This {{is very much the}} case of <b>petrol</b> <b>stations.</b> They constitute important nodes in the road network, filling up thirsty fuel tanks and hungry stomachs, guiding road users and providing vehicle-services. In this thesis the role of the <b>petrol</b> <b>station</b> for road users was investigated in order {{to find out if the}} <b>petrol</b> <b>station</b> was a potential hot spot. We performed an ethnographic field study at a <b>petrol</b> <b>station</b> and found that a great number of visitor activities took place at the <b>petrol</b> <b>station.</b> These indicated the significance of the <b>petrol</b> <b>station</b> for road users. There were much more taking place than traditional car maintenance. We found that the <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> prerequisites for becoming a digital hotspot were favourable. Aspects of interest to consider for IT implementation were also identified. The ability of the <b>petrol</b> <b>station</b> to provide timely information about e. g. the vicinity of the <b>petrol</b> <b>station</b> and road related information are examples of such aspects. The possibility to support people that travel a lot in their work and people having a journey break are further aspects of interest for a <b>petrol</b> <b>station</b> hot spot. Desig...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Proliferation of <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> in Maiduguri and Jere has now {{reached a}} level of unimaginable {{nightmare}} with perceived consequences on both {{human health and the}} environment. It is against this the paper evaluates the environmental effects of the <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> in their neighbourhoods in Maiduguri and Jere. Specifically, it examined the presence of those <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> vis-a-vis residential houses within 100 m radius of location in the township; hazards associated with their activities/operation; and the perception of residents/petrol stations workers on the effects pose by those <b>petrol</b> <b>stations.</b> Only purposed-built <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> both functional and non-functional as at 2010 were considered in the study. Out of the 138 <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> in the study area, 122 (88. 41 %) were functional and 16 (11. 59 %) were non-functional. These <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> are spatially located unevenly across the major road network in the township. Data for the study were therefore obtained through field survey where the functional statuses of those <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> were recorded and GPS (Garmin 76 CSX) devise was equally used to determine their co-ordinates. Three household heads around each of the 35 sampled <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> were randomly sampled to provide information on the activities of the <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> that are either improving on the well-being of the residents or detrimental to their lives. From the sampled <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> also, two workers each were selected at random to source vital facts on the way and manner they are carrying out their duties and knowledge with regards to DPR guidelines.

50|$|The first 7-Eleven in Australia {{opened on}} August 24, 1977, in the Melbourne suburb of Oakleigh. The {{majority}} of stores {{are located in}} metropolitan areas, particularly in central business district areas. Stores in suburban areas often operate as <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> and most are owned and operated as franchises, with a central administration. 7-Eleven bought Mobil's remaining Australian <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> in 2010, converting them to 7-Eleven outlets, resulting in an immediate and unprecedented overnight major expansion of the brand. In South Australia all Mobil <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> were sold to Peregrine Corporation and branded as On The Run <b>petrol</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A general {{consensus}} generated from various news articles is that {{violence in the}} workplace {{is on the rise}} and that the workplace is no longer considered safe for many employees. Although some employees such as police officers and prison guards might encounter violence at work to some degree, more and more employees are experiencing the effects of public-initiated violence at work. They include petrol attendants working on the forecourts of <b>petrol</b> <b>stations.</b> Recently, Kole (2010) conducted research on the security measures to reduce workplace violence at <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> in Gauteng and highlighted issues and challenges that <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> face on a daily basis regarding workplace violence. Kole recommended several prevention strategies to reduce violent crimes at <b>petrol</b> <b>stations.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} add knowledge on this phenomenon by focusing on selected <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> in Johannesburg, to understand whether they experience similar issues and challenges regarding workplace violence and what strategies they use to prevent these issues and challenges. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with five managers and fifteen petrol attendants working at these selected <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> in Johannesburg in 2015. These interviews focused on violent Type I and non-violent Type II workplace violence that occur at their <b>petrol</b> <b>stations...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{an urban}} {{environment}} the typical anthropogenic sources of benzene are mainly the road traffic. Other important sources are <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> and small- scale industries using benzene as a solvent, {{such as the}} printing industry, etc. <b>Petrol</b> <b>stations</b> are the most significant of these additional sources. Evaporative emissions from <b>petrol</b> <b>station</b> operations include contributions due to the filling underground tank operations, due to the underground tank breathing and emptying, due to vehicle refuelling operations and lastly due to spillage. The <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> are frequently located in populated urban areas consequently exposing the population {{to this kind of}} pollution. The present study assesses the contribution of <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> to the ambient benzene concentrations in a mid- sized city. The scientific toolbox adopted to develop the studies includes an air quality simulation model and a GIS platform. Based on the method and the rate of filling, tank configuration and gasoline properties the evaporative emissions from <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> are calculated. This paper aims at presenting the approach, including the theoretical framework, and at discussing the results and their role within the city's quality of life argument...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{sought to}} establish working environment {{factors that affect}} Quality of Work Life among <b>petrol</b> <b>station</b> attendants in Kitale town. The objective {{of the study was}} to identify working environment aspects that affect Quality of Work Life among <b>petrol</b> <b>station</b> attendants. This study was an exploratory survey, carried out in 17 <b>petrol</b> <b>stations</b> that are located in Kitale Town, Kenya. The target population comprised 17 station managers and 170 attendants, out of which a sample of 102 respondents was selected: Seventeen (17) <b>Petrol</b> <b>Station</b> Managers using non – probabilistic purposeful sampling and eighty five (85) attendants using simple random sampling. The study used a questionnaire as an instrument for data collection. Data collected was both quantitative and qualitative, and analysis was basic descriptive in nature. The study revealed that poor safety and health, work pressure or stress, and provision of inadequate working tools are environmental aspects that bring about poor Quality of Working Life experiences at <b>petrol</b> <b>stations.</b> In conclusion, the findings were examined and then the implications discussed. General recommendations were made for the improvement of Quality of Work Life among <b>petrol</b> <b>station</b> attendants...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{describe}} selected biochemical and hematological parameters (blood picture, liver enzymes, {{and kidney}} functions) in <b>petrol</b> <b>station</b> attendants in Mansoura city. Methods. This is a comparative cross-sectional study. The exposed group included 102 <b>petrol</b> <b>station</b> attendants.
