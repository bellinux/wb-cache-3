We {{show that the}} {{electric}} fields in the plasma for both schemes are very similar, and thus {{the dynamics of the}} driven beams are very similar.

40|$|Department of PhysicsThe plasma wakefield {{accelerator}} is one {{of promising}} and advanced particle accelerator models. It can make particle accelerator more compact and cheaper. A beam bunch propagating through plasma excites the plasma wakefield at some conditions. The optimum wake is obtained for k_p*σ_z = sqrt(2) and k_p*σ_r ≤ 1. Where k_p is plasma wave number and σ_z (or σ_r) is RMS beam length (or RMS beam radius). But {{we are interested in}} using CERN’s long and high-energy proton beams. The CERN’s proton beams are much longer (~ 12 cm) than the optimum <b>driving</b> <b>beam</b> length (in order of plasma wavelength λ_p). Here we focus on the instability which occurs based on the interaction between beam and plasma electrons. By this instability, the long <b>driving</b> <b>beam</b> is modulated along the propagation direction, so it makes the beam satisfy the optimum size for excitation of plasma waves. What we should know is that the plasma oscillation which is initially and axi-symmetrically excited by beam head will seed self-modulation of <b>driving</b> <b>beam.</b> Therefore, we first study fundamental theories of excitation of plasma waves by the charged particle beam. It’s about the response of plasma electrons to <b>driving</b> <b>beam.</b> The <b>driving</b> <b>beam</b> doesn’t interact with and only affects plasma. Here excited plasma wakefields should be considered. As the next step, the dynamics of plasma wakefield accelerator is introduced. Evolution of beam envelope in time could result in beam centroid offset or radius pinching. Where the two phenomena, centroid offset and radius pinching of the beam in plasma are called ‘Self-modulation instability’ and ‘Hose instability’. Those two instabilities compete each other. As the last step, the parameters of Injector Test Facility (ITF) at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) is used to demonstrate the self-modulation instability. ope...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Increasing {{the driving}} {{amplitude}} could improve {{the sensitivity of}} silicon microgyroscope, which is the effective way to enhance the performance of gyroscope. However the large driving amplitude leads to the nonlinear effect. As a result, the resonance frequency is dependent with the driving amplitude, which influences the frequency stability of gyroscope. The equivalent model of <b>driving</b> <b>beam</b> is established, and the stiffness formulas of <b>driving</b> <b>beam</b> are derivated according to the large deflection theory. The linear stiffness of <b>driving</b> <b>beam</b> is 270. 1 N/m and the nonlinear stiffness is 3. 237 × 108 N/m 3, which are 2. 7 % and 6. 4 % different from the simulative results. Harmonic balance method {{can be used to}} establish the relationship between driving amplitude and resonance frequency. The theoretical analysis results are carried out compared with the simulative analysis results. Also the impact of driving amplitude on resonance frequency is confirmed by experiment test. This paper is significant for improving the frequency stability, and provides a theoretical basis for optimizing the structure of gyroscope...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel piezoelectric vibration energy harvester (PVEH) {{in which a}} high-frequency generating beam (HFGB) is driven by an array of low-frequency <b>driving</b> <b>beams</b> (LFDBs) using ropes.

The experimental {{results show that the}} output power of generating beam (GB) remains unchanged with the increasing number of <b>driving</b> <b>beams</b> (DBs), compared with the traditional arrays of beams vibration energy harvester (AB-VEH), and the output power and bandwidth behavior can be adjusted by parameters such as acceleration, rope margin, and stiffness of LFDBs, which shows the potential to achieve unlimited wideband vibration energy-harvesting for a variable environment...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAdaptive <b>driving</b> <b>beams</b> (ADB) avoid glare for {{approaching}} or leading drivers {{but otherwise}} provide high beam lighting. Audi's implementation uses {{a matrix of}} LED units to deactivate individual LEDs when it detects leading or approaching vehicles. A test track study measured perceived discomfort glare by having 20 participants view and rate headlight configurations from five roadway approaches. The headlight conditions included an Audi A 8 with ADB, the A 8 with ADB deactivated (resulting in an LED low beam pattern that met European specifications), a 2013 Mazda 3 with low beam adaptive curve HID headlights, and a 2014 Dodge Durango SUV with low beam HID headlights. Five approaches included left and right gradual and sharp curves and a straight approach. Participants rated glare comfort {{on a scale from}} 1 to 9, with higher ratings indicating more acceptable glare. Glare from the Durango was rated as less comfortable (M = 6. 15) than the other three systems. The Mazda 3 (M = 6. 82) received more acceptable glare ratings than the Durango. The A 8 ADB (M = 7. 25) received more acceptable glare ratings than the Durango and the Mazda 3 but was not rated differently from the A 8 low beam LED condition (M = 7. 36). Mean and maximum illuminance measures for the approach vehicles corresponded well with subjective ratings. These findings demonstrate the promise for adaptive <b>driving</b> <b>beam</b> headlight systems, and the tested adaptive <b>driving</b> <b>beam</b> system is presently available for use in the European market. However, FMVSS 108 requires discrete high and low beam settings, which does not allow adaptive <b>driving</b> <b>beam</b> systems in the United States. Measuring illuminance dynamically may provide an alternative regulatory approach...|$|R
