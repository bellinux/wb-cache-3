25|$|A small, left-facing Indian-style {{swastika}} {{was painted}} {{on the inside of}} the original <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner</b> of the Spirit of St. Louis along with the names of all the Ryan Aircraft employees who designed and built it. It was meant as a message of good luck prior to Lindbergh's solo Atlantic crossing as the symbol was often used as a popular good luck charm with early aviators and others. The inside of the original <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner</b> can be viewed at the National Air and Space Museum. This <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner</b> was found to be cracked when Lindbergh arrived at New York prior to his transatlantic flight. The <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner</b> that is on the Spirit of St. Louis now was hastily made in New York to replace the cracked original and was on the aircraft during the transatlantic flight.|$|E

25|$|His {{personal}} Albatros D.V {{during this}} period {{had one of the}} more fanciful paint schemes of the war. Its base color was green fuselage, tail, and elevators with a red <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner.</b> His insignia of black and white checkerboarding edged in red adorned the fuselage just ahead of the Maltese crosses, with a thin red line ringing the fuselage just before the tail.|$|E
25|$|Even {{in an era}} of relaxed garb and standards, Woollettt was colourful. He wore a leopardskin flying {{helmet and}} gauntlets when he flew. His {{aircraft}} was equally distinctive, with the <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner</b> painted as a Native American's face and a dragon trailing {{down the length of the}} fuselage. He also briefly adorned his aircraft with white 'splotches' as experimental camouflage to aid his balloon busting, but his superiors made him remove them.|$|E
25|$|Tank {{introduced}} a further refinement to this basic concept. He suggested placing {{most of the}} airflow components on the propeller, {{in the form of}} a oversized <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner</b> whose outside diameter was the same as the engine. The cowl around the engine proper was greatly simplified, essentially a basic cylinder. Air entered through a small hole at the centre of the spinner, and was directed through ductwork in the spinner so it was blowing rearward along the cylinder heads. To provide enough airflow, an internal cone was placed in the centre of the hole, over the propeller hub, which was intended to compress the airflow and allow a smaller opening to be used. In theory, the tight-fitting cowling also provided some thrust due to the compression and heating of air as it flowed through the cowling.|$|E

50|$|Jasta 12 {{operated}} Fokker D.I, Albatros D.III, Fokker Dr.I, and Fokker D.VII fighter aircraft. The common squadron {{paint scheme}} was black tails and rear fuselages with white <b>propeller</b> <b>spinners</b> and/or engine cowlings.|$|R
50|$|The first {{prototype}} flew on 9 October 1939. By {{the end of}} 1939, this aircraft had logged only 10 {{hours of}} flight, due to the unreliable engines. This was not sufficient to adequately evaluate the design, so in March 1940, the engines were replaced with Piaggio P.XII radial engines with three-blade propellers, with improved engine nacelles and <b>propeller</b> <b>spinners.</b>|$|R
500|$|The first XBTM-1 {{made its}} maiden flight on 26 August 1944 and began flight testing after {{it reached the}} Naval Air Test Center (NATC) on 11 December. The Navy ordered 750 more {{aircraft}} on 15 January 1945, although this was reduced to 99 aircraft after the surrender of Japan in August. The second prototype made its first flight on 20 May. Initial flight tests conducted with the first two prototypes revealed significant problems with the engine, its cowling, the vertical stabilizer and rudder. In response, the cowling was lengthened [...] and the engine mount was canted two degrees {{to the right to}} offset the engine's tremendous torque. The length of the carburetor airscoop was extended and the <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner,</b> rudder, and the vertical stabilizer were redesigned. In April 1946 the aircraft designation was changed to AM-1 when the Navy replaced its Bomber-Torpedo classification with Attack, well before the redesign was completed in early 1947.|$|E
500|$|The VRDK was a motorjet, a {{rudimentary}} type of jet engine where an external power source drove the engine's compressor. It forced {{air into the}} stainless steel combustion chamber where fuel was sprayed from seven nozzles and ignited to exhaust out the variable rear nozzle. In the I-250 a [...] Klimov VK-107R V-12 piston engine {{was used as the}} primary powerplant. After takeoff a clutch {{at the end of the}} crankshaft could be engaged which drove a step up gearbox with a ratio of 13:21 to an extension shaft that powered the compressor of the VRDK. The air for the compressor was fed through a long duct that ran from the inlet underneath the <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner,</b> thence under the engine and through the belly of the aircraft. This duct also fed air to the oil cooler near the engine, but the water radiator was positioned behind the compressor to maximize airflow over it. A secondary duct led from the main duct to the VK-107's supercharger; when the VRDK was running the secondary duct diverted some of that additional air to the supercharger which boosted the engine's output to [...] at [...] The increased airflow over the engine radiator helped to dump the engine's excess heat into the exhaust stream. However the VRDK was limited to only ten minutes' operating time per sortie, which meant that it was useless weight during the rest of the flight.|$|E
2500|$|Hurricane Mk IIA Series 2 was {{equipped}} with new and slightly longer <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner</b> and new wing-mounting 12 x [...]303in (7.7mm) Browning machine guns. The first aircraft were built in October 1940 and were renamed Mark IIB in April 1941.|$|E
25|$|The Douglas XA-26 {{prototype}} (AAC Ser. No. 41-19504) first flew on 10 July 1942 at Mines Field, El Segundo, with {{test pilot}} Benny Howard at the controls. Flight tests revealed excellent performance and handling, but engine cooling problems led to cowling changes and {{elimination of the}} <b>propeller</b> <b>spinners</b> on production aircraft. Repeated collapses during testing led to reinforcement of the nose landing gear.|$|R

During operations in Vietnam, in May 1966, the aircraft were reassigned the old attack designation of A-26A. The A-26As were retired in 1969 when they had reached the safe limits of allotted flying time.|$|R

The influence of different nose forms, skirts, flaps, <b>propellers,</b> <b>spinners,</b> and special blowers has been investigated...|$|R
2500|$|Hurricane Mk IIA Series 1 {{equipped}} with new and slightly longer <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner,</b> and fully replaced the machine-gun armament with four 20mm (.79in) Hispano Mk II cannons, two per side. Hurricane IIA Series 2 became the Mk IIC in June 1941, using a slightly modified wing. The new wings {{also included a}} hardpoint for a [...] bomb and, later in 1941, fuel tanks. By then performance was inferior to the latest German fighters, and the Hurricane changed to the ground-attack role, {{sometimes referred to as}} the Hurribomber. The mark also served as a night fighter and intruder.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prospective}} design, although yet to fly, {{was mentioned}} at a February 1914 {{meeting of the}} Royal Aeronautical Society by Brigadier General David Henderson, who said:"If anyone wants to know which country has the fastest aeroplane in the world-it is Great Britain". [...] The S.E.4 was first flown in June 1914, demonstrating performance every bit as good as hoped, with a maximum speed of 135mph (217km/h), making it the fastest aircraft in the world. [...] The novel mounting of the mainwheels proved unstable during taxiing, {{and was replaced by}} more conventional V-struts. The engine was prone to overheating, so the <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner</b> had an opening cut into it and a fan installed inside the spinner to help cool the engine.|$|E
2500|$|With the new Merlin XX, {{performance}} {{was good enough}} to keep the ageing Hurricane in production. Hawker soon introduced the new Mark IIA Series 2 with either of two wings; one mounting 12 Brownings, the other with four Hispano cannon in the original gun-bays. The first Series 2s, armed with 12 [...]303in (7.7mm) Brownings (four per wing in the original gun-bays and two more in new gun-bays outboard of the landing lights) arrived in October. These Mk IIA Series IIs also featured a new longer <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner</b> and later become the Mark IIB in April 1941. The tailwheel recess on the ventral keel was changed in shape and the tailwheel leg became a levered-suspension unit with a small torque link.|$|E
50|$|Placing {{personalized}} decorations {{on fighting}} aircraft began with Italian and German pilots. The first recorded piece of nose art was a sea monster painted on an Italian flying boat in 1913. This {{was followed by}} the popular practice of painting a mouth beneath the <b>propeller's</b> <b>spinner,</b> begun by German pilots in World War I. The cavallino rampante (prancing horse) of the Italian ace Francesco Baracca was another well-known image. Nose art of that era was often conceived and produced not by the pilots, but rather the aircraft ground crews.|$|R
50|$|Bell enjoyed {{much success}} the {{following}} year {{with the development of}} the single engine P-39, of which 9,588 were built. Putting their previous experience with Allison engines to good use, the P-39 placed the engine {{in the center of the}} aircraft, with the propeller driven by a long shaft through which a 37mm cannon was also mounted, firing through the <b>propeller's</b> <b>spinner.</b> Due to persistent development and production problems, the original turbosupercharger was deleted from production models, instead using a single-stage, single-speed supercharger, as was standard on all other Allison-powered products, with the exception of the P-38.|$|R
50|$|The engine chosen was a new, higher-power and lighter-weight {{version of}} the Pratt & Whitney R-2800 that had been {{developed}} for the Douglas DC-6. Propeller hubs were taken from F4U Corsairs, four-blade <b>propellers</b> and <b>spinners</b> from DC-7s.|$|R
2500|$|A6M5b, Model 52乙 (Otsu, b) – Armament change: The 7.7mm (.303in) Type 97 gun (750m/s muzzle {{velocity}} and 600m/1,970ft range) {{in the right}} forward fuselage {{was replaced by a}} 13.2mm Type 3 Browning-derived gun (790m/s muzzle {{velocity and}} 900m/2,950ft range, with a rate of fire of 800 rounds per minute) with 240 rounds. The larger weapon required an enlarged opening, creating a distinctive asymmetric appearance {{to the top of the}} cowling, and a revised gas outlet near the windscreen. In addition, each wing cannon received a fairing at the wing leading edge. A plate of armored glass 45mm thick was fitted to the windscreen. A larger <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner</b> was fitted, suggesting a change to the propeller. [...] The type of ventral drop tank was changed, it now had fins and was suspended on a slanted pipe. [...] The first of this variant was completed in April 1944 and it was produced until October 1944.|$|E
2500|$|Compared to {{the earlier}} Bf 109 E, the Bf 109 F was much {{improved}} aerodynamically. The engine cowling was redesigned to be smoother and more rounded. The enlarged <b>propeller</b> <b>spinner,</b> adapted {{from that of the}} new Messerschmitt Me 210, now blended smoothly into the new engine cowling. Underneath the cowling was a revised, more streamlined oil cooler radiator and fairing. A new ejector exhaust arrangement was incorporated, and on later aircraft a metal shield was fitted over the left hand banks to deflect exhaust fumes away from the supercharger air-intake. The supercharger air-intake was, from the F-1 -series onwards, a rounded, [...] "elbow"-shaped design that protruded further out into the airstream. A new three-blade, light-alloy VDM propeller unit with a reduced diameter of 3m (9ft 8.5in) was used. Propeller pitch was changed electrically, and was regulated by a constant-speed unit, though a manual override was still provided. Thanks to the improved aerodynamics, more fuel-efficient engines and the introduction of light-alloy versions of the standard Luftwaffe 300 litre drop tank, the Bf 109 F offered a much increased maximum range of 1,700km (1,060mi) compared to the Bf 109 E's maximum range figure of only 660km (410 miles) on internal fuel, and with the E-7's provision for the 300 litre drop tank, a Bf 109E so equipped possessed double the range, to 1,325km (820mi).|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} one of several dealing with methods {{intended}} to reduce the drag of present-day radial engine installations and improve the cooling at zero and low air speeds, The present paper describes model wind-tunnel tests of blowers of three designs tested in conjunction with a wing-nacelle combination. The principle of operation involved consists of drawing cooling air into ducts located in the wing root at the point of maximum slipstream velocity, passing the air through the engine baffles from rear to front, and exhausting the air through an annular slot located between the propeller and the engine {{with the aid of a}} blower mounted on the spinner. The test apparatus consisted essentially of a stub wing having a 5 -foot chord and a 15 -foot span, an engine nacelle of 20 inches diameter enclosing a 25 -horsepower electric motor, and three blowers mounted on <b>propeller</b> <b>spinners.</b> Two of the blowers utilize centrifugal force while the other uses the lift from airfoils to force the air out radially through the exit slot. Maximum efficiencies of over 70 percent were obtained for the system as a whole. Pressures were measured over the entire flight range which were in excess of those necessary to cool present-day engines, The results indicated that blowers mounted on <b>propeller</b> <b>spinners</b> could be built sufficiently powerful and efficient to warrant their use as the only, or chief, means of forcing air through the cooling system, so that cooling would be independent of the speed of the airplane...|$|R
25|$|The Il-18B was {{powered by}} four Ivchenko AI-20A Series 1 turboprops, each {{providing}} a takeoff power of 2,985kW (4,000 shp) and sustained power of 2,090kW (2,800 shp) at cruise altitude.

Later Il-18B production featured AI-20A Series 2 engines, with the same power ratings, but with technical improvements, thus older machines were updated with the Series 2 powerplants. The AI-20s drove four-bladed variable pitch reversible props with a diameter of 4.5 meters (14 feet 9 inches), featuring prominent <b>propeller</b> <b>spinners,</b> and hydraulic actuation for prop pitch. The engines were mounted above the wing and featured integrated fire extinguishers. The engines were started with electric motors, the power for the motors being provided by a ground cart.|$|R
50|$|Although the Japanese civil {{versions}} {{were nearly}} identical to their Douglas equivalent, the military variants, while visually similar, were substantially different. The Kinsei 51/53 engines had 1,325 hp (975 kW) and featured enlarged nacelles and large <b>propeller</b> <b>spinners,</b> while the cockpit bulkhead was moved back 40 inches (100 cm) so all four crew members forward were in one compartment, with three extra windows added behind the cockpit. The most radical changes to the original design came about due to wartime exigencies in shortages of strategic materials, that led to metal components in less critical structural areas being replaced by wood. As many as 20 transports featured wooden rudders, stabilizers, ailerons, fins, elevators and entrance doors. An all-wood variant, the L2D5, was readied for production {{near the end of}} the war.|$|R
