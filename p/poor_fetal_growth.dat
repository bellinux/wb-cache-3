40|$|Abstract: Fetal {{growth is}} an {{important}} risk factor for infant morbidity and mortality. In turn, socioeconomic status is a key predictor of fetal growth; however, other sociodemographic factors and environmental effects may also be important. This study modelled geographic variation in <b>poor</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> after accounting for socioeconomic status, with a fixed effect for socioeconomic status and a combination of spatially-correlated and spatially-uncorrelated random effects. The dataset comprised 88, 246 liveborn singletons, aggregated within suburbs in Perth, Western Australia. Low socioeconomic status was strongly {{associated with an increased}} risk of <b>poor</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>growth.</b> An increase in geographic variation of <b>poor</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> from 1999 – 2001 (interquartile odds ratio among suburbs = 1. 20) to 2004 – 2006 (interquartile odds ratio = 1. 40) indicated a widening risk disparity by socioeconomic status. Low levels of residual spatial patterns strengthen the case for targeting policies and practices in areas of low socioeconomic status for improved outcomes. This study indicates an alarming increase in geographic inequalities in <b>poor</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> in Perth which warrants further research into the specific aspects of socioeconomic status that act as risk factors...|$|E

40|$|Objective: We {{aimed to}} study the {{maternal}} retinal microvasculature at mid-trimester and its relationship with subsequent <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> and birth size. Methods: We recruited 732 pregnant women aged 18 - 46 years in the first trimester with singleton pregnancies. All had retinal photography and fetal scan performed at 26 - 28 weeks gestation, and subsequent fetal scan at 32 - 34 weeks gestation. Infant anthropometric measurements were done at birth. Retinal microvasculature was measured using computer software from the retinal photographs. Results: In multiple linear regression models, each 10 μm narrowing in maternal retinal arteriolar caliber was associated with decreases of 1. 36 mm in fetal head circumference at 32 - 34 weeks gestation, as well as decreases of 1. 50 mm and 2. 30 mm in infant head circumference and birth length at delivery, respectively. Each standard deviation decrease in maternal retinal arteriolar fractal dimension was associated with decreases of 1. 55 mm in fetal head circumference at 32 - 34 weeks gestation, as well as decreases of 1. 08 mm and 46. 42 g in infant head circumference and birth weight at delivery, respectively. Conclusions: Narrower retinal arteriolar caliber and a sparser retinal vascular network in mothers, reflecting a suboptimal uteroplacental microvasculature during mid-pregnancy, were associated with <b>poorer</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> and birth size...|$|R

We explored whether paraoxonase (PON 1), a key enzyme involved in detoxification of OPs, could be an effect modifier in this association. The study population included 470 pregnant women enrolled in the CHAMACOS Study, a longitudinal cohort study of mothers and children living in an agricultural region of California. We analyzed urine samples collected from mothers twice during pregnancy for dialkyl phosphate (DAP) metabolites of OP pesticides. We analyzed maternal and fetal (cord) blood samples for PON 1 genotype (PON 1 (192) and PON 1 (- 108)) and enzyme activity (paraoxonase and arylesterase). Infant birth weight, head circumference, and gestational age were obtained from medical records. Infants' PON 1 genotype and activity were associated with birth outcome, but mothers' were not. Infants with the susceptible PON 1 (- 108 TT) genotype had shorter gestational age (β = - 0. 5 weeks, 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) : - 0. 9, 0. 0) and smaller head circumference (β = - 0. 4 cm, 95 % CI: - 0. 7, 0. 0) than those with the PON 1 (- 108 CC) genotype. Infants' arylesterase and paraoxonase activity were positively associated with gestational age. There was some evidence of effect modification with DAPs: maternal DAP concentrations were associated with shorter gestational age only among infants of the susceptible PON 1 (- 108 TT) genotype (p-value(interaction)  =  0. 09). However, maternal DAP concentrations were associated with larger birth weight (p-value(interaction)  =  0. 06) and head circumference (p-value(interaction) < 0. 01) in infants with non-susceptible genotypes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: As well {{as being}} highly comorbid conditions, autism {{spectrum}} disorders (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID) share a number of clinically-relevant phenomena. This raises questions about similarities and overlap in diagnosis and aetiological pathways that may exist for both conditions. AIMS: To examine maternal conditions and perinatal factors for children diagnosed with an ASD, with or without ID, and children with ID of unknown cause, compared with unaffected children. METHODS: The study population comprised all live singleton births in Western Australia (WA) between January 1984 and December 1999 (N = 383, 153). Univariate and multivariate multinomial logistic regression models were applied using a blocked modelling approach to assess the effect of maternal conditions, sociodemographic factors, labour and delivery characteristics and neonatal outcomes. RESULTS: In univariate analyses mild-moderate ID was associated with pregnancy hypertension, asthma, urinary tract infection, some types of ante-partum haemorrhage, any type of preterm birth, elective C-sections, breech presentation, <b>poor</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> and need for resuscitation at birth, with all factors showing an increased risk. Severe ID was positively associated with <b>poor</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> and need for resuscitation, {{as well as any}} labour or delivery complication. In the multivariate analysis no maternal conditions or perinatal factors were associated with an increased risk of ASD without ID. However, pregnancy hypertension and small head circumference were associated with a reduced risk (OR = 0. 64, 95 % CI: 0. 43, 0. 94; OR = 0. 58, 95 % CI: 0. 34, 0. 96, respectively). For ASD with ID, threatened abortion before 20 weeks gestation and <b>poor</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> were associated with an increased risk. CONCLUSION: Findings show that indicators of a poor intrauterine environment are associated with an elevated risk of ID, while for ASD, and particularly ASD without ID, the associations are much weaker. As such, these findings highlight the importance of accounting for the absence or presence of ID when examining ASD, if we are to improve our understanding of the causal pathways associated with these conditions...|$|E

40|$|International audienceHuman {{implantation}} {{involves a}} major {{invasion of the}} uterine wall and complete remodelling of uterine arteries by extravillous cytotrophoblasts (EVCT). Abnormality in these early steps of placental development leads to <b>poor</b> placentation, <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> defects and {{is often associated with}} preeclampsia, a major and frequent complication of human pregnancy. To study the mechanisms that control trophoblast invasion during early placental development and provide new insight in the understanding of preeclampsia, we have developed in vitro models of human invasive trophoblasts. We have shown that activation of the ligand-activated nuclear receptor PPARgamma with synthetic (rosiglitazone) or natural (15 deoxyPGJ(2)) agonists inhibits the trophoblastic invasion process. Analysis of PPARgamma-target genes revealed that placental growth hormone and the protease PAPP-A might be involved in the PPARgamma-mediated effect in an autocrine manner. We next investigated PPARgamma ligands at the materno-fetal interface and have shown that oxidized LDLs are present in EVCT in situ and decrease trophoblast invasion in vitro. Analysis of oxidized LDLs revealed that they contain potent PPARgamma agonists such as eicosanoids and also high levels of oxysterols, which are specific ligands for the liver X receptor (LXR). The isoform beta of LXR was found in EVCT in situ, and activation of LXRbeta with synthetic or natural ligands inhibits trophoblast invasion in vitro. Together, our data underscore a major role for PPARgamma and LXRbeta in the control of human trophoblast invasion and suggest that excess ligands such as oxidized LDLs at the implantation site might {{contribute to the development of}} preeclampsia...|$|R

This research provides novel data on the determinants of low-grade systemic inflammation in Gambians and investigates whether patterns of early growth predict levels of inflammatory markers in Gambian adults. In a cross-sectional study of 180 healthy male and female Gambians (aged 3 - 82 years) no single measure of anthropometry, body composition, chronic or infectious disease, or lifestyle explained more than 12 % of the variance in any inflammatory marker. Inflammatory markers fell into three distinct groups: those predominately explained by (i) adiposity or leptin (C-reactive protein (CRP), Serum Amyloid A (SAA), orosomucoid, fibrinogen and sialic acid (SA)); (ii) chronic or infectious disease (neopterin) and (iii) markers with no predominant determinants (a l-antichymotypsin (ACT) and β 2 -microglobulin (β~ 2 M)). In a study of 320 Gambians (51. 9 % males) aged 18 - 30 years {{there was no evidence that}} birth weight, low birth weight, season of birth or weight at one year predicted levels of eight inflammatory markers (CRP, SAA, orosomucoid, fibrinogen, ACT, SA, Interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and neopterin). In analyses adjusted for age and sex more rapid growth between birth and three months of age was associated with higher levels of fibrinogen, orosomucoid and SA. These relationships persisted after further adjustment for body mass index but after full adjustment only the association with fibrinogen remained; fibrinogen increased by 0. 09 (95 % Cl 0. 02, 0. 16) g/L per one unit increase in change in standard deviation score from birth to three months (p= 0. 008).

Intervillositis, a local inflammatory response to placental malaria, is central to the pathogenesis of <b>poor</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> as it impairs transplacental amino acid transport. Given the link between inflammation and autophagy, we investigated whether placental malaria-associated intervillositis increased placental autophagy as a potential mechanism in impaired fetal growth. We examined placental biopsies collected after delivery from uninfected women (n = 17) and from women with Plasmodium falciparum infection with (n = 14) and without (n = 7) intervillositis. Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining coupled with advanced image analysis were used to quantify the expression of autophagic markers (LC 3 -II, LC 3 -I, Rab 7, ATG 4 B and p 62) and the density of autophagosomes (LC 3 -positive puncta) and lysosomes (LAMP 1 -positive puncta). Placental malaria with intervillositis was associated with higher LC 3 -II:LC 3 -I ratio, suggesting increased autophagosome formation. We found higher density of autophagosomes and lysosomes in the syncytiotrophoblast of malaria-infected placentas with intervillositis. However, there appear to be no biologically relevant increase in LC 3 B/LAMP 1 colocalization and expression of Rab 7, a molecule involved in autophagosome/lysosome fusion, was lower in placental malaria with intervillositis, indicating a block in the later stage of autophagy. ATG 4 B and p 62 expression showed no significant difference across histological groups suggesting normal autophagosome maturation and loading of cargo proteins into autophagosomes. The density of autophagosomes and lysosomes in the syncytiotrophoblast was negatively correlated with placental amino acid uptake.

It is likely that misclassification is rare in a Caucasian population. Whilst NIDDM is widely believed to be genetically determined, recent epidemiological observations have consistently revealed statistical associations between indices of <b>poor</b> <b>fetal</b> and infant <b>growth</b> with susceptibility to loss of glucose tolerance in adult life. A possible explanation of these observations is that environmental constraints on <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> lead to permanent changes in organogenesis such that a poor capacity for insulin secretion and insulin resistance result. It is postulated that these adaptive responses serve to preserve the growth of certain organs, such as the brain, at the expense of others, such as the viscera. In addition, alterations in the function of organs, such as the liver, serve to aid survival of the offspring under conditions of poor postnatal nutrition. The results of studies of an animal model in which pregnant rats were fed a reduced protein diet are consistent with these concepts. The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus continues to be based upon the measurement of the glucose concentration in the blood stream, usually after the consumption of 75 g of glucose by mouth (the oral glucose tolerance test).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Follow up {{studies in}} Britain {{have shown that}} low rates of <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> are {{followed}} by reduced lung function in adult life, independent of smoking and social class. It is suggested that fetal adaptations to undernutrition in utero result in permanent changes in lung structure, which in turn lead to chronic airflow obstruction. India has high rates of intrauterine growth retardation, but no study has examined the association between <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> and adult lung function in Indian people. We have related size at birth to lung function in an urban Indian population aged 38 - 59 years. METHODS: Two hundred and eighty six men and women born in one hospital in Mysore City, South India, during 1934 - 1953 were traced by a house-to-house survey of the city. Their mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were measured using a turbine spirometer. These measurements were linked to their size at birth, recorded at the time. RESULTS: In {{both men and women}} mean FEV 1 fell with decreasing birthweight. Adjusted for age and height, it fell by 0. 09 litres with each pound (454 g) decrease in birthweight in men (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 01 to 0. 16) and by 0. 06 (95 % CI - 0. 01 to 0. 13) in women. Likewise, mean FVC fell by 0. 11 litres (95 % CI 0. 02 to 0. 19) with each pound decrease in birthweight in men, and by 0. 08 litres (95 % CI 0. 002 to 0. 16) in women. FEV 1 and FVC were lower in men who smoked, but the associations with size at birth were independent of smoking. Small head circumference at birth was associated with a low FEV 1 /FVC ratio in men which may reflect restriction in airway growth in early gestation. CONCLUSION: This is further evidence that adult lung function is "programmed" in fetal life. Smoking may be particularly detrimental to the lung function of populations already disadvantaged by <b>poor</b> rates of <b>fetal</b> <b>growth.</b> ...|$|R

Cardiac remodeling and cardiac output changes are consistent with a gradual increase in afterload and compromised arterial compliance in conditions of decreased <b>fetal</b> <b>growth.</b> These changes have already begun to occur before the stage of clinically apparent <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> restriction and may contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in later life.

40|$|Worldwide, {{stillbirth}} {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of death. Altered <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> and placental abnormalities are the strongest and most prevalent known risk factors for stillbirth. The aim of this study was to identify patterns of association between placental abnormalities, <b>fetal</b> <b>growth,</b> and stillbirth. Population-based case-control study of all stillbirths and a representative sample of live births in 59 hospitals in 5 geographic areas in the U. S. <b>Fetal</b> <b>growth</b> abnormalities were categorized as small (90 th percentile) for gestational age at death (stillbirth) or delivery (live birth) using a published algorithm. Placental examination by perinatal pathologists was performed using a standardized protocol. Data were weighted to account for the sampling design. Among 319 singleton stillbirths and 1119 singleton live births at ≥ 24 weeks at death or delivery respectively, 25 placental findings were investigated. Fifteen findings were significantly associated with stillbirth. Ten of the 15 were also associated with <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> abnormalities (single umbilical artery; velamentous insertion; terminal villous immaturity; retroplacental hematoma; parenchymal infarction; intraparenchymal thrombus; avascular villi; placental edema; placental weight; ratio birth weight/placental weight) while 5 of the 15 associated with stillbirth were not associated with <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> abnormalities (acute chorioamnionitis of placental membranes; acute chorioamionitis of chorionic plate; chorionic plate vascular degenerative changes; perivillous, intervillous fibrin, fibrinoid deposition; fetal vascular thrombi in the chorionic plate). Five patterns were observed: placental findings associated with (1) stillbirth but not <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> abnormalities; (2) <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> abnormalities in stillbirths only; (3) <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> abnormalities in live births only; (4) <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> abnormalities in stillbirths and live births in a similar manner; (5) a different pattern of <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> abnormalities in stillbirths and live births. The patterns of association between placental abnormalities, <b>fetal</b> <b>growth,</b> and stillbirth provide insights into the mechanism of impaired placental function and stillbirth. They also suggest implications for clinical care, especially for placental findings amenable to prenatal diagnosis using ultrasound that may be associated with term stillbirths...|$|R
40|$|Links between {{indices of}} <b>poor</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> and either adult type 2 diabetes, the {{metabolic}} syndrome, or both are reproducible in many studies and many ethnic groups. It {{has been proposed}} that genetic factors, environmental factors, or a mixture of both underlie these links. Studies of monozygotic twins have shown that environmental factors operate independently of the genome. Attention has been focused recently on links with childhood growth, particularly rapid catch-up growth before puberty. Animal models have shown that poor maternal nutrition can lead to glucose intolerance and hypertension in offspring. The molecular mechanisms mediating these links are unclear.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{roles of}} the placenta are to protect the fetus from harmful substances while actively ensuring appropriate transfer of the nutrients essential for optimal fetal growth and development. Failure of the placenta to protect or nourish the fetus can have significant consequences for the offspring both before birth and throughout its postnatal life. <b>Poor</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> is associated with increased risk of many common chronic disorders in adult life, including coronary heart disease, diabetes and some forms of cancer. These long-term consequences have {{been referred to as}} “fetal programming”. The placenta is the interface between the mother and the fetus, influencing both the intrauterine environment and fetal growth, and placental function is therefore likely to be a major determinant of programming effects. Understanding the role of the placenta in fetal programming may provide new avenues for prevention and treatment of at-risk individuals. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{hypothesis}} linking {{low birth weight}} and <b>poor</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> with future risk of cardiovascular disease was first proposed, {{there has been much}} interest in the early origins of disease. As rates of obesity increase and as maternal obesity has become common, interest has been directed towards the early origins of obesity. It is likely that a complex interaction of inherited gene effects and in-utero environment may interact in the developing fetus to programme pathways leading to future obesity. It is clear that maternal metabolism is disturbed in pregnancy in obese women, and that offspring of obese mothers have a higher percentage of body fat and are insulin resistant. This review discusses the ideas contributing to the current working concept of obesity programming, and discusses several potential mechanisms that may underlie obesity programming and susceptibility to future metabolic and vascular disease.

40|$|The {{compelling}} evidence linking small size at birth with later cardiovascular disease has renewed and amplified scientific and clinical interests into {{the determinants of}} <b>fetal</b> <b>growth.</b> It is accepted that genes and nutrition control fetal growth; however, prior to this study, it had been impossible to isolate the effect of increases and decreases in fetal oxygenation on the regulation of prenatal growth. We investigated the role of oxygen in the control of <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> in the chicken because in contrast to mammals, the effects on the fetus of changes in oxygenation could be isolated, by assessing them directly without alteration to the maternal or placental physiology or maternal nutrition during development. The data show that incubation at high altitude of fertilized eggs laid by sea level hens markedly restricted <b>fetal</b> <b>growth.</b> Incubation at high altitude of fertilized eggs laid by high altitude hens also restricted <b>fetal</b> <b>growth,</b> but {{to a lesser extent}} compared to eggs laid by sea level hens. By contrast, incubation at sea level of fertilized eggs laid by high altitude hens not only restored, but enhanced, <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> relative to sea level controls. Incubation at high altitude of sea level eggs with oxygen supplementation completely prevented the high altitude-induced <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> restriction. Thus, <b>fetal</b> oxygenation, independent of maternal nutrition during development, has a predominant role in the control of <b>fetal</b> <b>growth.</b> Further, prolonged high altitude residence confers protection against the deleterious effects of hypoxia on <b>fetal</b> <b>growth...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Environmental {{influences}} during fetal {{life and}} early infancy {{have been suggested}} to influence body composition throughout the life-course. Especially <b>poor</b> <b>fetal</b> nutrition and <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> restriction have been designated important risk factors for gaining high fat mass or low bone mass during later life. As body composition tends to track from childhood into adulthood, the fight against widespread overweight and osteoporosis should focus on prevention from early life onwards. This thesis aimed {{to assess the impact}} of maternal diet, more specific fish and milk consumption during pregnancy on fetal growth; define the strongest early maternal, paternal, fetal and infant risk factors of preschool overweight, study the influence of maternal smoking on childhood body composition and explore the associations of maternal diet as well as <b>fetal</b> and infant <b>growth</b> patterns with childhood bone mass. To address these aims the studies included in this thesis were conducted within the Generation R Study, a population-based prospective cohort study from fetal life onwards. The findings of this thesis indicate maternal fish consumption is not associated with <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> characteristics. Maternal shell fish consumption even showed a negative association with birth weight. Contrary, maternal milk consumption was associated with increased <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> leading to a higher weight and head circumference at birth. Drinking more than one glass of milk daily increased <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> from the third trimester of pregnancy onwards. The protein fraction from milk, rather than the fat or carbohydrate fraction seemed to drive the association. These findings suggest that maternal milk consumption during pregnancy influences <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> patterns, whereas fish consumption may play a lesser role. Furthermore, results of this thesis show that parental anthropometrics, household income, <b>fetal</b> and infant <b>growth,</b> and infant diet were most strongly predicted preschool overweight. Also, 6 -year-old girls, but not boys, born from mothers who continued smoking throughout pregnancy were found to have higher BMI, total fat mass, android/gynoid fat ratios, subcutaneous abdominal fat mass, and preperitoneal abdominal fat mass than girls of mothers who did not smoke. Remarkably, paternal smoking showed a similar association. Hence, these findings indicate that fetal and infant nutrition, as well as subsequent growth patterns may play an important role in the risk of developing overweight. The increased adiposity and adverse fat mass distribution found in girls exposed to smoking during pregnancy is more likely explained by familial factors related to smoking behavior than by intrauterine mechanisms. Both <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> and infant growth were found to independently contribute to childhood bone mass. Growth in the first year of life appeared to have the largest impact on bone mineral accrual. After the first year, the impact of height and weight growth slowly decreased every year. Furthermore, if present, catch-up growth in the first two postnatal years compensated for the consequences <b>fetal</b> <b>growth</b> restriction had on childhood bone mass. Also, maternal nutrient intakes during pregnancy are associated with childhood bone measures. Maternal phosphorus intake and homocysteine concentrations most-strongly predicted absolute bone mineral accrual in childhood, whereas maternal protein intake and vitamin B- 12 concentrations were the strongest predictors of actual bone mineral density. Maternal smoking appeared to be positively associated with childhood bone measures. However, this association was fully explained by increased body weight. Paternal and household smoking were not associated with childhood bone health. Taken together, these results show maternal diet during pregnancy as well as <b>fetal</b> and infant <b>growth</b> patterns may influence childhood bone health. Yet, maternal smoking does not seem to a play a role. In conclusion, the findings of this thesis suggest maternal dietary factors during pregnancy influence <b>fetal</b> <b>growth,</b> while maternal diet and nutritional status, as well as subsequent <b>fetal</b> and infant <b>growth</b> patterns may influence childhood adiposity and bone mass. Shared familial factors related to maternal smoking, rather than maternal smoking itself, seemed to adversely affect childhood adiposity. Prevention of future overweight and osteoporosis should therefore start from early pregnancy onwards...|$|R
