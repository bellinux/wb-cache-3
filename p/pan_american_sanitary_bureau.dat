They later tried infecting people with [...] "direct inoculations made from syphilis bacteria poured into the men's penises and on forearms and faces that were slightly abraded [...] [...] [...] or in a few cases through spinal punctures". Approximately 700 people were infected as part of the study (including orphan children). The study was sponsored by the Public Health Service, the National Institutes of Health and the <b>Pan</b> <b>American</b> Health <b>Sanitary</b> <b>Bureau</b> (now the World Health Organization's <b>Pan</b> <b>American</b> Health Organization) and the Guatemalan government. The team was led by John Charles Cutler, who later participated in the Tuskegee syphilis experiments.

In 2010 when the research was revealed, the US officially apologized to Guatemala for the studies.

Parran made Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania a proving ground for ideas developed during his tenure at PHS, recruiting the school's first generation of senior faculty and bringing his deputy surgeon general and veteran international health administrator, Dr. James A. Crabtree, who succeeded him as dean in 1958. Beyond his tenure as Surgeon General, Parran remained prominent in international health, active in the <b>Pan</b> <b>American</b> <b>Sanitary</b> Organization and in Rockefeller Foundation programs. On retiring from Pittsburgh in 1958, Dr. Parran became president of the Avalon Foundation, affiliated with the Mellon family, and became active in the A. W.

The home of the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, Parran Hall, was renamed for Parran in 1969.|$|R
40|$|Measles {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{infectious}} diseases. Before measles vaccine was introduced, nearly everyone contracted the disease at some point in childhood. By the late 1980 s, most countries had incorporated measles vaccine into their routine immunization programmes. Globally, about 800 000 children nevertheless still die from measles annually, half of them in Africa. Eradicating measles would therefore play an important role in improving children's survival. The 24 th <b>Pan</b> <b>American</b> <b>Sanitary</b> Conference in 1994 established a goal of eradicating measles from the Americas. Progress to date has been remarkable and the disease is no longer endemic in the Americas, with most countries having documented interruption of transmission. As of November 2003, 12 months had elapsed since the last indigenous case was detected in Venezuela. This experience shows that measles transmission can be interrupted, and that this can be sustained over a long period of time. Global eradication is feasible if an appropriate strategy is implemented. Even under a new paradigm in which immunization is not discontinued after measles is eradicated, eradication will be a good investment to avoid expensive epidemics and save the lives of almost one million children annually. A world free of measles by 2015 is not a dream...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is to analyze the Worldwide Anti-Yellow Fever Campaign {{launched}} in 1914 by Wickliffe Rose, the first Director of the International Health Board (IHB) of the Rockefeller Foundation (RF). This campaign was developed between the 1910 s and 1930 s and continued after World War II, under the auspices of the <b>Pan</b> <b>American</b> <b>Sanitary</b> <b>Bureau</b> (PASB) with a new name, "Continental Campaign for Eradication of Aedes aegypti.

40|$|The {{absence of}} urban {{yellow fever virus}} (YFV) in Bolivian cities has been {{attributed}} to the lack of competent urban mosquito vectors. Experiments with Aedes aegypti from Santa Cruz, Bolivia, demonstrated infection (100 %), dissemination (20 %), and transmission of a Bolivian YFV strain (CENETROP- 322). Yellow fever virus (YFV) may cause severe hemor-rhagic fever in humans. The virus is transmitted between susceptible vertebrate hosts by infected mosqui-toes in the genera Aedes, Haemagogus, or Sabethes (1). In the Americas, YFV occurs in two transmission cycles. In the jungle/sylvatic cycle, the virus is transmitted between susceptible monkeys, and possibly other vertebrates, by tree-hole–breeding mosquitoes (1). Jungle yellow fever (YF) cases occur when these infected vectors feed on sus-ceptible humans. In the urban cycle, YFV is transmitted to humans by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (1). In 2003, a total of 226 cases of jungle YF were reported from South America to the Pan American Health Organization, and as of June 23, ongoing outbreaks in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru during 2004 have thus far resulted in 86 confirmed cases and 41 deaths (2). An Ae. aegypti eradication campaign initiated by the <b>Pan</b> <b>American</b> <b>Sanitary</b> <b>Bureau</b> in 1947 eliminated this species from most of Central and South America, and urban YF disappeared from the Americas in the 1940 s. However, during the past 20 years, many countries aban-doned Ae. aegypti control measures, and this urban vector now reoccupies almost the entire area of its distribution preeradication (1). Ae. aegypti was eradicated from Bolivia during the 1960 s and 1970 s but reappeared in the city of Santa Cruz in 1980, and epidemics of dengue fever occurred during the 1980 s and 1990 s (3). In 1997 to 1998, six cases of YF were reported among Santa Cruz residents, and some were regarded as urban YF cases (3); despite a population> 1 million, low vaccine immunization cover-age, and the presence of Ae. aegypti (3), no urban YF out-break occurred. Based on these observations, researchers have suggested that sylvan strains of YFV circulating in Bolivia may not be infective for Bolivian Ae. aegypti. This study examined that hypothesis and the infectivity of a Bolivian strain of YFV for Bolivian Ae. aegypti...|$|E
40|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) Region of the Americas {{has been}} a global leader in measles, rubella and {{congenital}} rubella syndrome (CRS) elimination. The <b>Pan</b> <b>American</b> Health Organization (PAHO) has coordinated the successful elimination efforts of all member countries within the Region of the Americas. Regional measles elimination has been sustained since 2002 and PAHO set an elimination goal for rubella and CRS by 2010. No endemic cases of rubella have been reported since 2009 and the last endemic CRS case in the Americas was also reported in 2009. Three other WHO regions, the European, Eastern Mediterranean and Western Pacific regions have targeted measles for elimination by 2015 or before. Other regions are focused on measles mortality reduction strategies. The WHO European Region has a rubella elimination target of 2015 and the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Pacific regions have established congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) prevention goals. The Southeast Asian and African Regions have not established goals for rubella control or elimination. As a PAHO member country, the United States {{is committed to the}} goal of eliminating endemic measles, rubella, and CRS from the Region of the Americas, and to the documentation and verification of elimination by the end of 2011, as resolved by the 27 th <b>Pan</b> <b>American</b> <b>Sanitary</b> Conference (CSP 27.
