While escaping, he encounters Captain James Gordon, who is distrusting of Batman, and the corrupt SWAT team, who hope to collect the bounty money for themselves. Following advice from Gordon's daughter Barbara, Batman enters the sewers beneath the GCPD for <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> to the database and finds Black Mask's crew planting explosives. Using the database, Batman deduces that Black Mask was kidnapped by the Joker, presumably to access the Gotham Merchants Bank. At the bank, Black Mask removes his disguise for Batman and reveals himself as the Joker; having assumed Black Mask's identity several days prior, the Joker seized his criminal empire and imposed the bounty on Batman. Batman chases the Joker to the Sionis Steel Mill, where he frees Black Mask and defeats the poisonous assassin Copperhead.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{research}} what, if anything, state governments are doing to meet the enormous challenges of ensuring <b>permanent</b> public <b>access</b> to state electronic government information. A comprehensive survey was created and distributed to AALL authors in each of the fifty states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. State authors completed the survey by December 2002 and, in addition, submitted a short executive summary based on their survey results. The survey reveals that only one state—Colorado—has enacted legislation that explicitly addresses <b>permanent</b> public <b>access</b> (effective August 15, 2003). No state, including Colorado, comprehensively addresses the challenges of <b>permanent</b> public <b>access</b> to and preservation of electronic government information. State records boards, state archives and state libraries are often aware of <b>permanent</b> public <b>access</b> issues and have often taken steps to preserve electronic information. They have sometimes taken steps to provide continuous public access or have developed guidelines for state agencies to provide such access. These efforts of state records boards, state archives and state libraries are often ineffective, however, because they lack a solid statutory foundation. Without comprehensive statutes supporting a system to coordinate and centralize <b>permanent</b> public <b>access,</b> state agencies thwart the positive efforts of state records boards, state archives and state libraries. The agencies fail to appreciate the need to ensure the full lifecycle of electronic government information, particularly Web-based publications and records. And any guidelines for <b>permanent</b> public <b>access</b> that target them do not solve the problem of agencies’ lack the expertise, personnel and funding. We envisioned that this project would be the first step in the advocacy process necessary to enact state laws that will prevent the loss of important state government information in electronic format. Toward this end, we sought to create a document that could be provided to legislators and other policymakers to educate them about the responsibility of state governments to ensure <b>permanent</b> public <b>access</b> to electronic information. An additional objective was to strengthen the GRC and WAO’s ties to AALL members at the local level, thereby forming a base of activists who could advocate for improved laws mandating <b>permanent</b> public <b>access</b> to state government information. Because AALL and other library organizations lack the manpower to tackle the problem of disappearing electronic government information in all states simultaneously, the Grant Team has identified key states to target for legislative activity...|$|R

25|$|Broadcast 25 November 1993, {{the second}} {{programme}} examines what happens during spring on Antarctica. The sea ice extends {{for hundreds of}} miles around the continent, {{but there are a}} few subantarctic islands that escape it. Such places are highly valued, for as the sea never freezes, animals can always get ashore. Elephant seals are the first creatures to return to the beaches. They form large breeding colonies, where the males fight fierce battles to gain and retain <b>permanent</b> <b>access</b> to a great number of females and mate with them as soon as they are receptive again. Millions of macaroni penguins occupy huge territories on the islands to breed, as do thousands of albatrosses. The Antarctic peninsula is one of the few regions of the continent inhabited by animals, even in summer. Gentoo penguins build their nests on bare rock and humpback whales seek krill along the coast, while Adelie penguins nest even further south. Crabeater seals, one of the most numerous mammals on Earth, live and reproduce in the pack ice zone around Antarctica. Snow petrels fly many miles into the island to find rock on which to lay their eggs.|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{chronic renal failure}} and {{cannulation}} of <b>permanent</b> venous <b>accesses</b> in patients treated at haemodialysis centres is a topical and widespread problem of these days. According to generally accessible resources the incidence of terminal stage of renal failure, and thus the necessity to treat a patient by means of elimination methods, is very high, it reaches four individuals per thousand inhabitants according to the statistics. It is obviously a widespread nursing problem. The theoretical part of the thesis is divided into a summary and description of the present situation in chronic renal failure, particularly a brief insight into the chronic renal failure and its causes and syndromes. It also deals with {{the topic of the}} present treatment possibilities with stress on patient treatment at nephrologic outpatient clinics and in haemodialysis centres. The next chapter of the thesis describes the development from haemodialysis history up to the present advanced elimination methods. The present elimination methods bring the necessity of functional provision of venous access, particularly cannulation of AV fistulas, it is a very frequent nursing operation provided by nurses treating chronically affected patients at haemodialysis centres. This chapter is concluded by general knowledge of the techniques of cannulation of <b>permanent</b> venous <b>accesses,</b> possible occurrence of complications during the cannula penetration itself in relation to the physical phase of nursing treatment about patients with chronic renal failure. The practical part of the thesis was aimed at discovering or possible confirmation of the hypotheses discussed in the theoretical part. The practical research was based on searching for problems among dialyzed patients related to the <b>permanent</b> venous <b>access,</b> on finding the approach of nurses working at dialysis centres to cannulation of <b>permanent</b> <b>accesses</b> and on mapping the access of patients with <b>permanent</b> venous <b>access</b> to nurses with short time experience at a dialysis centre. Research questions were determined for this purpose and were processed within qualitative research into case reports upon depth interviews with nurses working at the dialysis centres of České Budějovice Hospital, Český Krumlov Hospital and Písek Hospital and their patients. The research data were processed into charts, where responses from patients and those from nurses were assessed separately. Occurrence frequency of the individual answers was particularly monitored in the individual output tables, however the responses were not processed by means of standard statistic methods because of the chosen methodology and thus a low number of respondents, but the output data served for drawing conclusions and preparing recommendations for application of nursing methods. The thesis conclusion summarizes the obtained knowledge and recommends possible procedures of solving the problems of cannulation of <b>permanent</b> venous <b>accesses</b> in patients with chronic renal failure treated at haemodialysis centres...|$|R

40|$|Impact of {{surgeon and}} {{surgical}} center characteristics on choice of <b>permanent</b> vascular <b>access.</b> BackgroundThe {{impact of the}} surgeon and surgical center characteristics on choice of autogenous arteriovenous (AV) fistula versus artificial AV graft as <b>permanent</b> vascular <b>access</b> for hemodialysis has not been studied. MethodsWe used national data from the Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Health Administration to measure the association of surgeon and surgical center characteristics with choice of initial <b>permanent</b> vascular <b>access</b> among patients undergoing their first vascular access placement procedure between October 1, 2000 and September 30, 2001 (fiscal year 2001). Data were analyzed using a hierarchical logistic regression model clustered for surgical center and surgeon. ResultsThe study population included 1114 patients, 74 Veterans Administration Medical Centers, and 182 surgeons. Seventy-two percent of patients received an AV fistula as their initial form of <b>permanent</b> vascular <b>access.</b> After adjusting for differences in patient, center, and surgeon characteristics, odds of AV fistula placement at high volume centers (> 30 procedures per year) were {{more than three times}} greater than at low volume centers [odds ratio (OR) 3. 26, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 37 to 7. 75, P = 0. 008]. In addition, a strong clustering effect was present {{at the level of the}} surgeon (OR 1. 55, 95 % CI 1. 19 to 2. 03, P = 0. 001) but not at the level of the surgical center, indicating an association with surgeon practice pattern. ConclusionBarriers to AV fistula placement can exist at the levels of the surgeon and surgical center, respectively. Future strategies to improve AV fistula placement rates should target surgeons and surgical centers in addition to patients, nephrologists, and primary care providers...|$|R
