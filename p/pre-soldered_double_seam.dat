50|$|<b>Double</b> <b>seaming</b> uses rollers {{to shape}} the can, lid and the final <b>double</b> <b>seam.</b> To make a {{sanitary}} can and lid suitable for <b>double</b> <b>seaming,</b> manufacture begins with a sheet of coated tin plate. To create the can body, rectangles are cut and curled around a die, and welded together creating a cylinder with a side seam.|$|R
50|$|Before {{regulating}} {{inspection procedures}} and frequencies, the regulation pertaining to <b>double</b> <b>seams</b> establishes the terminology, explains how a seam is formed and lists the possible <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> defects.|$|R
5000|$|Cover droop - A droop is {{a smooth}} {{projection}} of a <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> below {{the bottom of}} a normal seam. The droop may occur at any point of the <b>double</b> <b>seam.</b>|$|R
50|$|Use of a Statistical Process Control (SPC) {{software}} {{in conjunction with}} a manual double-seam monitor, computerized <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> scanner, or even a fully automatic <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> inspection system makes the laborious process of <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> inspection faster and much more accurate. Statistically tracking the performance of each head or seaming station of the can seamer allows for better prediction of can seamer issues, and may be used to plan maintenance when convenient, rather than to simply react after bad or unsafe cans have been produced.|$|R
5000|$|The {{regulation}} {{states that}} the can manufacturer is responsible for providing the can filler with guidelines and specifications for the can seam: [...] "Can seam guidelines (specifications) are provided to the low acid canned food manufacturer by the supplier of the container and end being used. The guidelines detail the measurements, in thousands of an inch, of each attribute of the <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> for both {{the first and second}} seaming operations. They also provide a set-up aim or ideal starting dimensions for the set up of the seamer. The operating limits set the range for good practice." [...] While specifying these guidelines is important, the plant is responsible for the <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> quality: [...] "It is extremely important to understand that seam guidelines by themselves cannot be used for determining the quality of a <b>double</b> <b>seam.</b> The seam guidelines are to be used in setting up the <b>double</b> <b>seams</b> initially and maintaining seam integrity during production. Final acceptability of the <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> should be based on total evaluation of the seam by a qualified person and not on dimensions alone. Good seaming practice requires constant visual examination, frequently scheduled tear-down evaluation, machine maintenance, and immediate correction of unacceptable conditions." [...] The regulation also states that if the <b>double</b> <b>seams</b> do not meet the guidelines, the can filler plant [...] "must know what steps to take to correct the condition".|$|R
5000|$|... #Subtitle level 4: Responsibility for {{the quality}} of the <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> ...|$|R
50|$|A <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> is {{the closure}} between a can {{body and a}} can end (or lid).|$|R
50|$|Invented in 1888 by Max Ams, modern <b>double</b> <b>seams</b> {{provide an}} {{airtight}} seal to the tin can. This airtight nature {{is crucial to}} keeping micro-organisms out of the can and keeping its contents sealed inside. Thus, <b>double</b> <b>seamed</b> cans are also known as Sanitary Cans. Developed in 1900 in Europe, this sort of can {{was made of the}} traditional cylindrical body made with tin plate. The two ends (lids) were attached using what is now called a <b>double</b> <b>seam.</b> A can thus sealed is impervious to contamination by creating two tight continuous folds between the can's cylindrical body and the lids. This eliminated the need for solder and allowed improvements in manufacturing speed, reducing cost.|$|R
5000|$|The {{regulation}} {{allows for}} two different methods of <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> examination; the [...] "micrometer" [...] method or the [...] "optical" [...] method.|$|R
50|$|The {{requirements}} for <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> examinations are specified in 21 CFR Part 113.60(a)(1). The regulation states that teardown examinations shall {{be performed by}} a trained closure technician at intervals of sufficient frequency to ensure proper closure. The teardown examinations shall {{be made on the}} packer's end <b>double</b> <b>seams</b> on at least one can from each seaming head to ensure maintenance of seam integrity. Sufficient frequency is defined in the regulation as intervals not to exceed 4 hours (operational time).|$|R
5000|$|Knocked Down Flange - A {{knocked down}} flange is a {{critical}} seam defect and it occurs when the cover and body hooks do not interlock dues to a bent can flange before <b>double</b> <b>seaming.</b>|$|R
50|$|The FDA {{continues}} by {{detailing the}} requirements of <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> destructive testing:"The <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> teardown examination is a destructive test. Tools {{that are used to}} perform this test include a seam micrometer, countersink gauge can opener and nippers. Optional equipment for seam teardown examinations include a seam saw, seam projector and seam scope. Although it is not imperative the investigator carry this equipment to each LACF inspection, {{it is very important that}} they know how to operate this equipment and read measurements from the micrometer, seam projector or seam scope. It is also important that the investigator know how to determine the tightness or wrinkle rating of the cover hook. Knowledge of the procedures used to perform <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> teardown examination are essential to evaluating the firm's knowledge and ability to do this examination. Attachment 14 explains the procedure for using a seam projector for examining a cross section of the seam. Attachment 15 explains the can seam micrometer and procedure for use, and Attachment 16 explains the use of a seamscope for the same exam.|$|R
5000|$|Micrometer {{measurements}} {{are made and}} recorded in thousandths of an inch. The high and low {{measurements are}} recorded on the <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> teardown examination record. If the manufacturer is using the micrometer method the required measurements are: ...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> is {{made using}} a double seamer, which can {{have just one}} or a number of heads or <b>seaming</b> stations. The <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> is formed by {{mechanically}} interlocking five layers of material together: three layers of the can end and two layers of the can body. Each seaming head typically consists of two rolls, a first operation roll and second operation roll, and a chuck. Some seaming machines have two first operation rolls and two second operation rolls and a few machines use a method called [...] "rail seaming" [...] which requires no rolls. During the seaming operation, the can end is lowered on to the filled can body and held down by the chuck, which acts as an anvil to the seaming operation. The first operation roll then engages the can end against the can body thereby folding the end curl around the flange of the body. In some seaming machines, this is done as the can is turning at high speed. In other seaming machines, the can is stationary and the first operation roll (or rolls) spins around several times to ensure a complete first operation. After the first operation is complete, the first operation roll disengages from the can and the second operation roll then engages the can. The purpose of the second operation is to iron out the <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> into its final shape and remove the voids between the layers of can and end material. In practice, ironing {{out all of the}} can and end material in a <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> without leaving some voids is impossible without the use of a sealing compound.|$|R
50|$|The first {{operation}} seam {{is critical}} to avoid problems like wrinkles (tightness issues) and leaks. The shape of the seam {{is determined by the}} shape of the first operation roll, the second operation roll, their relative positions and distances, lifter height, lifter pressure. Any damage or problems to the seamer or seamer tools can cause severe problems to the <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> like seam bumps, wrinkles, sharp seams, and open seams.|$|R
50|$|Incorrect setups can be non-intuitive. For example, {{due to the}} {{springback}} effect, a seam {{can appear}} loose, when in reality it was closed too tight and has opened up like a spring. For this reason, experienced operators and good seamer setup are critical to ensure that <b>double</b> <b>seams</b> are properly closed.|$|R
5000|$|Cover Vee - [...] "Vees" [...] or [...] "lips" [...] are {{projections}} of the <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> below {{the bottom of a}} normal seam that resemble a [...] "V" [...] shape. There is usually no overlap of the cover hook with the body hook and these defects usually occur in small areas of the seam.|$|R
5000|$|Originally, the can end was {{soldered}} or welded {{onto the}} can body after the can was filled. [...] However, this introduced {{a variety of}} issues, such as foreign contaminants (including lead and other harmful heavy metals). The <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> was later developed as a cheaper and safer alternative and quickly replaced the welded seam.|$|R
50|$|The {{shape of}} the <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> is {{determined}} by the {{shape of the}} seamer roll profile and the relative position. During the can seaming process, the seamer chuck holds the can while the rolls rotate around it. Initially, the first operation roll folds the lid (end) and then the second operation rolls tightens the resulting seam.|$|R
5000|$|X-ray systems. These systems utilize X-ray {{technology}} to either provide an {{image from the}} side of the <b>seam</b> (comparable to <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> projector images) or from the top. X-ray systems are also capable of measuring the Cover Hook Wrinkle without damaging the can - this can provide an objective result in contrast to the subjective operator's visual assessment.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{there are}} several {{parameters}} {{that can be used}} to judge seam quality, the FDA regulation specifies the most critical parameters: [...] "The most critical attributes to consider in judging the quality of the <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> are overlap and tightness (wrinkle). If one of the can seam measurements (i.e., body hook) is slightly beyond the specified guidelines but the rest of the seam is evaluated and the overlap and tightness (wrinkle) are within specified guidelines, then adjustments to the seamer can be made at the next scheduled shut-down. In this instance, the manufacturer should identify the out-of-guideline measurement and document they have evaluated the rest of the <b>double</b> <b>seam,</b> but did not find immediate corrective action necessary. However, if overlap measurement or tightness rating evaluation are below the minimum guidelines a resample from the questionable seaming station should be made. If the resample continues to show out-of-guideline measurements in overlap and/or wrinkle the machine should be stopped and adjusted." ...|$|R
50|$|One {{important}} {{part is the}} seamer setup. This process is usually performed by an experienced technician. Amongst the parts that need setup are seamer rolls and chucks which have to be set in their exact position (using a feeler gauge or a clearance gauge). The lifter pressure and position, roll and chuck designs, tooling wear, and bearing wear all contribute to a good <b>double</b> <b>seam.</b>|$|R
50|$|Quality control usually {{involves}} taking full cans {{from the line}} - one per seamer head, at least once or twice per shift, and performing a teardown operation (wrinkle/), mechanical tests (external thickness, seamer length/height and countersink) as well as cutting the seam open with a twin blade saw and measuring with a <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> inspection system. The combination of these measurements will determine the seam's quality.|$|R
5000|$|Seam bump - Seam bumps are a {{relatively}} short area of the <b>double</b> <b>seam,</b> where the seam thickness suddenly increases by 0.004" [...] (0.1 mm) or more. They are predominantly found on welded and two-piece cans with long body hooks and are usually seen on the can filler's end when hot filled products exceed 185 degrees (Fahrenheit). The cover hook radius may be {{pulled away from the}} body wall.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, the {{production}} and quality of <b>double</b> <b>seams</b> is regulated by the US Department of Health and Human Services - Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Department of Agriculture (USDA). The plant's responsibility towards the government depends on the product being canned. The FDA regulates all components of canning low acid canned foods, including handling of empty containers, glass, metal and plastic containers. The USDA regulates canning of animal products.|$|R
50|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} innovation since the introduction of <b>double</b> <b>seams</b> is the welded side seam. Prior to the welded side seam, the can body was folded and/or soldered together, leaving a relatively thick side seam. The thick side seam required that the side seam end juncture at the end curl to have more metal to curl around before closing in behind the Body Hook or flange, with a greater opportunity for error.|$|R
50|$|If the {{processor}} {{is using the}} micrometer method the regulation requires that three measurements are taken at points approximately 120° apart around the <b>double</b> <b>seam.</b> On three-piece cans the first measurement can be taken directly across from the side seam and the next two measurements are then taken 120° {{to either side of}} the first measurement. On three-piece cans the measurements must be taken at least one-half inch from the side seam juncture as the juncture may interfere with a true seam measurement.|$|R
25|$|<b>Double</b> <b>seam</b> rims {{are crucial}} to the joining of the wall to a top or bottom surface. An {{extremely}} tight fit between the pieces must be accomplished to prevent leakage; the process of accomplishing this radically deforms the rims of the parts. Part of the tube that forms the wall is bent, almost at its end, turning outward through 90 degrees, and then bent further, {{toward the middle of}} the tube, until it is parallel {{to the rest of the}} tube, a total bend of 180 degrees.|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} of a high-quality <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> is dependent on several factors, including conformity to the set can and end specifications, {{the quality of the}} seamer tooling used and its compliance with the can and end being used, the condition of the seaming machine and the setup of the seaming rolls, lifter pressure and other components. When the machinery is set up correctly and the incoming materials (cans, ends, tooling, etc.) comply to the set specifications, the result should be ideal first and second operation seams.|$|R
50|$|The roof of {{the temple}} {{consists}} of 5 levels, with each level are decreasing in size upward. Each level is decorated with lotus <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> and kudu niches. Kudu is a statues of head that carved inside niches. These bust statues look as if though they were to looking out from the window niches. Such ornaments also {{can be found in}} other Javanese temples, such as Kalasan, Gebang and Merak temple. The pinnacle of the roof were missing and its original form is unknown.|$|R
5000|$|Pleats, Puckers and Spurs - A pleat is a fold in {{the cover}} hook that extends from the cut edge {{downward}} toward the cover hook radius and sometimes below this radius in a sharp vee or spur shape. A pucker is a condition which is intermediate between a reverse wrinkle and a pleat, where the cover hook at the cut edge is locally distorted downward without actually folding. A spur is a localized irregularity characterized by a sharp protrusion {{at the bottom of}} the <b>double</b> <b>seam.</b> It is usually accompanied by a pleat or vee in the cover hook.|$|R
6000|$|The [...] "Giant" [...] was {{composed}} of yellowish white silk, of which there were used 22,000 yards at about 5 shillings 4 pence a yard, so {{that the cost of}} the silk alone was 5,866 pounds. This was cut into 118 gores, which were entirely hand-sewed with a <b>double</b> <b>seam,</b> and some idea of the vastness of the work may be gathered from the fact that 200 women were employed during a month in the sewing of the gores. For the sake of greater strength the silk was doubled. In other words, there were two balloons of the same size, one within the other.|$|R
5000|$|Seam projector, or seam scope. Originally {{built as}} {{projection}} systems, operators {{would cut the}} cans and project a magnification of the image onto a projector screen. Seam scopes and seam analysis systems digitize this and move the measurement method to a computer screen. Fully automatic <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> inspection systems extend this further by adding automatic detection to the various measurement points on the seam. In some cases, three cuts are made on a particular can. In others, a single cut is made, while external measurements (length, thickness, countersink) are evaluated using dedicated calipers or gauges. In addition, a wrinkle teardown is made (either from the same can, if one cut was made - or a separate can if three cuts were made).|$|R
5000|$|Eagle Creek was {{the first}} company in the market to market the [...] "adventure travel gear" [...] {{category}} {{and the first to}} offer travel backpacks. It also claims {{to be the first to}} utilize <b>double</b> needle <b>seam</b> stitching and a built-in organization panel in a backpack.|$|R
5000|$|The FDA {{regulations}} specifies {{the frequency}} and requirements of non-destructive testing: [...] "21 CFR Part 113.60(a) requires a visual examination of at least 1 can per seaming head by a qualified container closure inspector at intervals of sufficient frequency. The regulation requires that <b>double</b> <b>seamed</b> containers be visually inspected for gross closure defects such as sharp seams, cut-overs, deadheads, false seams, droops and broken chuck. The frequency of the visual examination should be made at intervals not to exceed 30 minutes (of operational time); and additional visual examinations must be performed immediately following a jam in a closing machine, after closing machine adjustment, or after startup of a machine following a prolonged shut-down. An example of a prolonged shut down may be when the plant ceases production at 6:00 PM and restarts production at 8:00 AM the next day." ...|$|R
40|$|The free {{boundary}} {{model of}} diffusion-induced grain boundary motion derived in [3, 6, 4] is extended, {{in the case}} of thin metallic films, to account for bidirectional motion, together with the appearance of S-shapes and <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> configurations. These are often observed in the laboratory. Computer simulations based on the extended model are given to illustrate these and other features of bidirectional motion. More generally, the extension accounts for the motion of grain boundaries whose traces on the film's surface are curved. The new free boundary model is one of forced motion by curvature, the forcing term possibly changing sign due to the bidirectionality. The thin film model is derived systematically under explicit assumptions, and an adjustment for grooving is included. 1 Introduction Boundaries between grains in a metallic alloy specimen may migrate due to chemical action. Atoms of a solute species in a vapor which is in contact with the metallic surface may enter the grain bo [...] ...|$|R
