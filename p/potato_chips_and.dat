2500|$|For dental health, {{frequency}} of sugar intake {{is more important}} than the amount of sugar consumed. [...] In the presence of sugar and other carbohydrates, bacteria in the mouth produce acids that can demineralize enamel, dentin, and cementum. [...] The more frequently teeth are exposed to this environment, the more likely dental caries is to occur. [...] Therefore, minimizing snacking is recommended, since snacking creates a continuous supply of nutrition for acid-creating bacteria in the mouth. [...] Also, chewy and sticky foods (such as candy, cookies, <b>potato</b> <b>chips,</b> <b>and</b> crackers) tend to adhere to teeth longer. However, dried fruits such as raisins and fresh fruit such as apples and bananas disappear from the mouth quickly, and do not appear to be a risk factor. For children, the American Dental Association and the European Academy of Paediatric Dentistry recommend limiting the {{frequency of}} consumption of drinks with sugar, and not giving baby bottles to infants during sleep (see earlier discussion). [...] Mothers are also recommended to avoid sharing utensils and cups with their infants to prevent transferring bacteria from the mother's mouth.|$|E
