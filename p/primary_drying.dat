50|$|The {{secondary}} drying phase aims to remove unfrozen water molecules, since the ice was removed in the <b>primary</b> <b>drying</b> phase. This {{part of the}} freeze-drying process is governed by the material's adsorption isotherms. In this phase, the temperature is raised {{higher than in the}} <b>primary</b> <b>drying</b> phase, and can even be above 0 °C, to break any physico-chemical interactions that have formed between the water molecules and the frozen material. Usually the pressure is also lowered in this stage to encourage desorption (typically in the range of microbars, or fractions of a pascal). However, there are products that benefit from increased pressure as well.|$|E

50|$|Freeze-drying - This process {{involves}} dehydration {{of materials}} that are heat-sensitive. Unlike spray drying, water is removed through the sublimation process without changing the structure or shape of the nanoparticles. Freeze-drying involves four states: freezing, <b>primary</b> <b>drying,</b> secondary drying, and storage. Because of the multiple stages involved, this method is considered to demand more energy and time.|$|E
50|$|Manifold freeze-dryers {{are usually}} {{used in a}} {{laboratory}} setting when drying liquid substances in small containers and when the product {{will be used in}} a short period of time. A manifold dryer will dry the product to less than 5% moisture content. Without heat, only <b>primary</b> <b>drying</b> (removal of the unbound water) can be achieved. A heater must be added for secondary drying, which will remove the bound water and will produce a lower moisture content.|$|E
50|$|During the <b>primary</b> <b>drying</b> phase, the {{pressure}} is lowered (to the range of a few millibars), and enough heat is supplied to the material for the ice to sublime. The amount of heat necessary can be calculated using the sublimating molecules' latent heat of sublimation. In this initial drying phase, about 95% {{of the water in}} the material is sublimated. This phase may be slow (can be several days in the industry), because, if too much heat is added, the material's structure could be altered.|$|E

This {{study was designed}} to assess patterns of topical cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion 0. 05 % (Restasis®) use in dry eye patients and determine if there were any differences in use based on whether dry eye is physician-coded as a primary or nonprimary diagnosis. Methods: Records for adult patients with a diagnosis of dry eye at an outpatient visit from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2009 were selected from Truven Health MarketScan® Research Databases. The primary endpoint was percentage of patients with at least one primary versus no <b>primary</b> <b>dry</b> eye diagnosis who filled a topical cyclosporine prescription. Data analyzed included utilization of topical corticosteroids, oral tetracyclines, and punctal plugs. Results: The analysis included 576, 416 patients, accounting for 875, 692 dry eye outpatient visits: 74. 7 % were female, 64. 2 % were ages 40 - 69 years, and 84. 4 % had at least one <b>primary</b> <b>dry</b> eye diagnosis. During 2008 – 2009, 15. 9 % of dry eye patients with a primary diagnosis versus 6. 5 % with no primary diagnosis filled at least one cyclosporine prescription. For patients who filled at least one prescription, the mean months’ supply of cyclosporine filled over 12 months was 4. 44. Overall, 33. 9 % of dry eye patients filled a prescription for topical cyclosporine, topical corticosteroid, or oral tetracycline over 2 years. Conclusion: Patients with a <b>primary</b> <b>dry</b> eye diagnosis were more likely to fill a topical cyclosporine prescription.

40|$|Freeze-drying is a {{relatively}} expensive process requiring long processing time, and hence {{one of the key}} objectives during freeze-drying process development is to minimize the <b>primary</b> <b>drying</b> time, which is the longest of the three steps in freeze-drying. However, increasing the shelf temperature into secondary drying before all of the ice is removed from the product will likely cause collapse or eutectic melt.

This situation is the result in the more primary forest clearing for agriculture usage by native people and migrants.

40|$|Lyophilization is {{a common}} method used to {{preserve}} pharmaceutical and biological products. Accurately measuring temperature during the three stages of lyophilization: freezing, <b>primary</b> <b>drying,</b> and secondary drying, is important to ensure product consistency and to reduce operating costs. Wireless temperature sensors were evaluated to determine if temperature is monitored accurately and to determine if wireless temperature sensors offer advantages over traditional temperature measurement technologies. These sensors contain three capacitors to monitor temperature as the solvent is sublimated. A Millrock Technology REVO lyophilizer was used for testing. Water and 5 % w/v sucrose solution were distributed in 3 mL fill volume increments into Wheaton 6 R vials. Wireless temperature sensor measurements were compared with thermocouple measurements.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to estimate differences in heat and mass transfer between freeze dryers due to inherent design characteristics using data obtained from sublimation tests. This study also aimed to provide guidelines for convenient scale-up of the freeze-drying process. Data obtained from sublimation tests performed on laboratory-scale, pilot, and production freeze dryers were used to evaluate various heat and mass transfer parameters: nonuniformity in shelf surface temperatures, resistance of pipe, refrigeration system, and condenser. Emissivity measurements of relevant surfaces such as the chamber wall and the freeze dryer door were taken to evaluate the impact of atypical radiation heat transfer during scale-up. “Hot” and “cold” spots were identified on the shelf surface of different freeze dryers, and the impact of variation in shelf surface temperatures on the <b>primary</b> <b>drying</b> time and the product temperature during <b>primary</b> <b>drying</b> was studied. Calculations performed using emissivity measurements on different freeze dryers suggest that a front vial in the laboratory lyophilizer received 1. 8 times more heat than a front vial in a manufacturing freeze dryer operating at a shelf temperature of − 25 °C and a chamber pressure of 150 mTorr during <b>primary</b> <b>drying.</b> Therefore, front vials in the laboratory are much more atypical than front vials in manufacturing.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{freeze-drying}} process and, in particular, with the optimization of the operating conditions of the <b>primary</b> <b>drying</b> stage.

So as to track the evolution of residual moisture during secondary drying, vials were regularly collected through a vacuum-tight sampling device; the residual moisture and the morphology of the porous cake was then determined by Karl Fischer titration and Scanning Electron Microscopy, respectively. The control of freezing promotes the formation of larger ice crystals and, as a result, accelerates the sublimation of ice and slows down the desorption process. Overall, we found that it reduces the total (primary and secondary) drying time and produces much more uniform batches than those obtained by the conventional freezing, and this positive effect was observed since the end of <b>primary</b> <b>drying.</b> In conclusion, the control of freezing was beneficial to the total drying time reduction, vial-to-vial homogeneity and allowed a better control of product inhomogeneity...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of dry ice particles in a jet flow {{has been studied}} experimentally. The particles were produced by rapid expansion of liquid carbon dioxide through a nozzle, based on the Joule–Thomson effect. Their size distribution was measured by a laser diffraction method. The experimental {{results showed that the}} <b>primary</b> <b>dry</b> ice particles ejected from the nozzle were about 1 μm in mass median diameter. However, they grew initially in the jet flow and then became smaller due to sublimation. As a result, a bimodal size distribution was formed at increased distances from the nozzle outlet. The presence of a thermally insulated tube at the outlet of the expansion nozzle enhanced the agglomeration of the particles, whereby agglomerates of about 100 μm in mass median diameter were recorded. The agglomeration process is considered to take place by the simultaneous processes of particle deposition and reentrainment; i. e. agglomerated particles are reentrained from the layer of dry ice particles deposited on the tube walls. The agglomerate size decreased with increasing flow velocity, due to the greater detachment force applied to the deposition layer.
