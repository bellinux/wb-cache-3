25|$|Saliva {{production}} may be pharmacologically {{stimulated by}} sialagogues such as pilocarpine and cevimeline. It {{can also be}} suppressed by so-called antisialagogues such as tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs, antihypertensives, and <b>polypharmacy.</b> Cancer treatments including chemotherapy and radiation therapy may impair salivary flow. Radiation therapy may cause permanent hyposalivation due to injury to the oral mucosa containing the salivary glands, resulting in dry mouth or xerostomia, whereas chemotherapy may cause only temporary salivary impairment.|$|E
25|$|A {{potential}} role pharmacogenomics {{may play}} {{would be to}} reduce the occurrence of <b>polypharmacy.</b> It is theorized that with tailored drug treatments, patients {{will not have the}} need to take several medications that are intended to treat the same condition. In doing so, they could potentially minimize the occurrence of ADRs, have improved treatment outcomes, and can save costs by avoiding purchasing extraneous medications. An example of this can be found in Psychiatry, where patients tend to be receiving more medications than even age-matched non-psychiatric patients. This has been associated with an increased risk of inappropriate prescribing.|$|E
25|$|The {{need for}} {{pharmacogenomics}} tailored drug therapies {{may be most}} evident in a {{survey conducted by the}} Slone Epidemiology Center at Boston University from February 1998 to April 2007. The study elucidated that an average of 82% of adults in the United States are taking at least one medication (prescription or nonprescription drug, vitamin/mineral, herbal/natural supplement), and 29% are taking five or more. The study suggested that those aged 65 years or older continue to be the biggest consumers of medications, with 17-19 % in this age group taking at least ten medications in a given week. <b>Polypharmacy</b> has also shown to have increased since 2000 from 23% to 29%.|$|E
500|$|Amidst {{mounting}} {{pressure in}} 1994, the Presley autopsy was reopened. Coroner Dr. Joseph Davis declared, [...] "There {{is nothing in}} any of the data that supports a death from drugs. In fact, everything points to a sudden, violent heart attack." [...] Whether or not combined drug intoxication was in fact the cause, {{there is little doubt that}} <b>polypharmacy</b> contributed significantly to Presley's premature death.|$|E
500|$|... "Drug use {{was heavily}} implicated" [...] in Presley's death, wrote Guralnick. [...] "No one {{ruled out the}} {{possibility}} of anaphylactic shock brought on by the codeine pills... to which he was known to have had a mild allergy." [...] A pair of lab reports that were filed two months later strongly suggested that <b>polypharmacy</b> was the primary cause of death; one reported [...] "fourteen drugs in Elvis' system, ten in significant quantity." [...] Forensic historian and pathologist Michael Baden viewed the situation as complicated: [...] "Elvis had had an enlarged heart for a long time. That, together with his drug habit, caused his death. But he was difficult to diagnose; it was a judgment call." ...|$|E
2500|$|Salivary {{flow rate}} is {{decreased}} during sleep, which {{may lead to}} a transient sensation of dry mouth upon waking. This disappears with eating or drinking or with oral hygiene. When associated with halitosis, this is sometimes termed [...] "morning breath". Dry mouth is also a common sensation during periods of anxiety, probably owing to enhanced sympathetic drive. Dehydration is known to cause hyposalivation, the result of the body trying to conserve fluid. Physiologic age-related changes in salivary gland tissues {{may lead to a}} modest reduction in salivary output and partially explain the increased prevalence of xerostomia in older people. However, <b>polypharmacy</b> is thought to be the major cause in this group, with no significant decreases in salivary flow rate being likely to occur through aging alone.|$|E
2500|$|Cline et al. {{identified}} several gaps in knowledge about medication in elderly patients discharged from hospital. Despite receiving written and verbal information, 27% {{of older people}} discharged after heart failure were classed as non-adherent within 30 days. Half the patients surveyed could not recall the dose of their medication and nearly two-thirds {{did not know what}} time of day to take them. A 2001 study by Barat et al. evaluated the medical knowledge and factors of adherence in a population of 75-year-olds living at home. They found that 40% of elderly patients do not know the purpose of their regimen and only 20% knew the consequences of non-adherence. Comprehension, <b>polypharmacy,</b> living arrangement, multiple doctors, and use of compliance aids was correlated with adherence. A conservative estimate says 10% of all hospital admissions are through patients not managing their medication [...]|$|E
50|$|<b>Polypharmacy</b> {{is the use}} of four or more {{medications}} by a patient, generally adults aged over 65 years. <b>Polypharmacy</b> is {{most common}} in the elderly, affecting about 40% of older adults living in their own homes. About 21% of adults with intellectual disability are also exposed to <b>polypharmacy.</b> <b>Polypharmacy</b> is not always bad, but it is bad in many instances, often being more harmful than helpful or presenting too much risk for too little benefit. Therefore, health professionals consider it a situation that requires monitoring and review to validate whether all of the medications are still necessary. Concerns about <b>polypharmacy</b> include increased adverse drug reactions, drug interactions, prescribing cascade, and higher costs. <b>Polypharmacy</b> is often associated with a decreased quality of life, including decreased mobility and cognition.|$|E
50|$|Measures can {{be taken}} to limit <b>polypharmacy</b> to its truly {{legitimate}} and appropriate needs. This is an emerging area of research, frequently called deprescribing. This reduction in medications has been shown {{to reduce the number of}} medications and is safe as it does not significantly alter health outcomes. Clinical pharmacists can perform drug therapy reviews and teach physicians and their patients about drug safety and <b>polypharmacy,</b> as well as collaborating with physicians and patients to correct <b>polypharmacy</b> problems. Similar programs are likely to reduce the potentially deleterious consequences of <b>polypharmacy.</b> Such programs hinge upon patients and doctors informing pharmacists of other medications being prescribed, as well as herbal, over-the-counter substances and supplements that occasionally interfere with prescription-only medication.|$|E

50|$|It is not {{uncommon}} for those dependent or addicted to substances to enter or remain in a state of <b>polypharmacy</b> misuse. Note, however, that the term <b>polypharmacy</b> and its variants generally refer to legal drug use as-prescribed, even when used in a negative or critical context.|$|E
5000|$|Considerations often {{associated}} with thoughtful, therapeutic <b>polypharmacy</b> include: ...|$|E

50|$|The risk of drug {{interactions}} is increased with <b>polypharmacy.</b>|$|E
50|$|Older {{people are}} the {{heaviest}} users of medications, and frequently take five or more medications (<b>polypharmacy).</b> <b>Polypharmacy</b> is associated with increased risks of adverse events, drug interactions, falls, hospitalization, cognitive deficits, and mortality. Thus, optimizing medication through targeted deprescribing is {{a vital part of}} managing chronic conditions, avoiding adverse effects and improving outcomes.|$|E

5000|$|Elderly people require {{specific}} {{attention to}} medications. Elderly people particularly {{are subjected to}} <b>polypharmacy</b> (taking multiple medications). Some elderly people have multiple medical disorders; some have self-prescribed many herbal medications and over-the-counter drugs. This <b>polypharmacy</b> may {{increase the risk of}} drug interactions or adverse drug reactions. In one study, it was found that prescription and nonprescription medications were commonly used together among older adults, with nearly 1 in 25 individuals potentially at risk for a major drug-drug interaction. [...] Drugs metabolites are excreted mostly by the kidneys or the liver, which may be impaired in the elderly, necessitating medication adjustment.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{studies have}} found {{decreased}} life expectancy {{associated with the use}} of antipsychotics, and argued that more studies are needed. Antipsychotics may also increase the risk of early death in individuals with dementia. [...] Antipsychotics typically worsen symptoms in people who suffer from depersonalisation disorder. Antipsychotic <b>polypharmacy</b> (prescribing two or more antipsychotics at the same time for an individual) is a common practice but not evidence-based or recommended, and there are initiatives to curtail it. Similarly, the use of excessively high doses (often the result of <b>polypharmacy)</b> continues despite clinical guidelines and evidence indicating that it is usually no more effective but is usually more harmful.|$|E
50|$|<b>Polypharmacy</b> and the {{widespread}} use of active psychiatric drugs made the study of individual compounds in psychiatric patients difficult. The science then successfully focused on alert male volunteers (since the EEG varied with menstrual cycles in women).|$|E
50|$|Patients at {{greatest}} risk for negative <b>polypharmacy</b> consequences include the elderly, psychiatric patients, patients taking {{five or more}} drugs concurrently, those with multiple physicians and pharmacies, recently hospitalized patients, individuals with concurrent comorbidities, low educational level, and those with impaired vision or dexterity.|$|E
50|$|People {{who engage}} in <b>polypharmacy</b> and other hypochondriac {{behaviors}} are at an elevated risk of death from CDI. Elderly people are at the highest risk of CDI, because of having many age-related health problems requiring many medications combined with age-impaired judgment, leading to confusion in taking medications.|$|E
50|$|The {{geriatric}} rheumatology clinic provides {{evaluation and}} management services {{to patients with}} various musculoskeletal and soft tissue disorders. Evaluation of the elderly patient is often complex due to the many comorbid conditions encountered in this population often compounded by cognitive disorders, functional decline, <b>polypharmacy</b> and limited social supports.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{intervention}} in <b>polypharmacy</b> patients is deprescribing, {{which includes the}} identification and discontinuance of medications when the benefit no longer outweighs the harm. In elderly patients, this can commonly be done as a patient becomes more frail and treatment focus needs to shift from preventative to palliative.|$|E
50|$|<b>Polypharmacy</b> {{continues}} to grow in importance because of aging populations. Many countries are experiencing a fast growth of the older population, 65 years and older. This growth {{is a result of}} the baby-boomer generation getting older and an increased life expectancy as a result of ongoing improvement in health care services worldwide.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Polypharmacy</b> is {{a related}} term, {{referring}} {{to the use of}} multiple medications (without regard to whether they are for the same or separate conditions/diseases). Sometimes [...] "polymedicine" [...] is used to refer to pharmaceutical combination therapy. Most of these kinds of terms lack a universally consistent definition, so caution and clarification are often advisable.|$|E
50|$|The APNA Annual Clinical Psychopharmacology Institute offers {{sessions}} {{which provide}} psychopharmacology continuing education contact hours related to psychiatric medications. This institute addresses {{the interaction of}} neurobiological and genetic mechanisms, Axis I and II disorders and clinical syndromes, and current health care issues in recovery including transcultural care delivery. Complex health issues, <b>polypharmacy,</b> and recently approved medications are also addressed.|$|E
50|$|Elevations in {{chloride}} may {{be associated}} with administration significant amounts of IV normal saline, diarrhea, certain kidney diseases as type 2 renal tubular acidosis, type 1 renal tubular acidosis, and overactivity of the parathyroid glands. Hyperchloremia is often comorbid with diabetes or hyponatremia. Certain drugs, especially diuretics such as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, hormonal treatments, and <b>polypharmacy,</b> may contribute to this disorder.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{important}} {{area is the}} potential for improper administration and use of potentially inappropriate medications, and the possibility of errors that could result in dangerous drug interactions. <b>Polypharmacy</b> is often a predictive factor (Cannon et al., 2006). Research done on home/community health care found that [...] "nearly 1 of 3 medical regimens contain a potential medication error" [...] (Choi et al., 2006).|$|E
50|$|Systematically {{addressing}} the common contributing factors (such as constipation, dehydration and <b>polypharmacy),</b> {{as well as}} providing a therapeutic environment (such as adequate lighting, minimizing noise, clear communication, minimizing relocation, signage, ways to tell the time, and helping the person to walk and be mobile) may prevent delirium. Rates with a number of interventions together decrease rates to 0.72 from baseline in the elderly.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to biology and environment, culturally determined attitudes toward illness and its treatment may affect how an individual responds to psychiatric medication. Some cultures see suffering and illness as unavoidable and not amenable to medication, while others treat symptoms with <b>polypharmacy,</b> often mixing medications with herbal drugs. Cultural differences {{may have an}} effect on adherence to medication regimes as well as influence the placebo effect.|$|E
50|$|The Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults, {{commonly}} called the Beers List, are guidelines for healthcare professionals {{to help improve}} the safety of prescribing medications for older adults. They emphasize deprescribing medications that are unnecessary, which helps to reduce the problems of <b>polypharmacy,</b> drug interactions, and adverse drug reactions, thereby improving the risk-benefit ratio of medication regimens in at-risk people.|$|E

50|$|Deprescribing is {{the process}} of {{intentionally}} stopping a medication or reducing its dose to improve the person's health or reduce the risk of adverse side effects. De-prescribing is usually done because the drug may be causing harm, may no longer be helping the patient, or may be inappropriate for the individual patient's current situation. De-prescribing is the opposite of prescribing a drug. It can help correct <b>polypharmacy</b> and prescription cascade.|$|E
50|$|Saliva {{production}} may be pharmacologically {{stimulated by}} sialagogues such as pilocarpine and cevimeline. It {{can also be}} suppressed by so-called antisialagogues such as tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs, antihypertensives, and <b>polypharmacy.</b> Cancer treatments including chemotherapy and radiation therapy may impair salivary flow. Radiation therapy may cause permanent hyposalivation due to injury to the oral mucosa containing the salivary glands, resulting in dry mouth or xerostomia, whereas chemotherapy may cause only temporary salivary impairment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Polypharmacy</b> is {{associated}} with an increased risk of falls in the elderly. Certain medications are well known {{to be associated with the}} risk of falls, including cardiovascular and psychoactive medications. The use of four or more of these medicines is known to be associated with a significantly higher, cumulative risk of falls. Although often not practical to achieve, withdrawing all medicines associated with falls risk can halve an individual's risk of future falls.|$|E
