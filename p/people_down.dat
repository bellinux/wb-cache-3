The explosion flattened six to eight buildings, blew in the fronts of the opposite houses on Broad Street, and wrenched shutters and doors from buildings at {{some distance from the}} immediate area. It propelled bricks and other missiles through the air, threw many <b>people</b> <b>down</b> who had gone as far as Beaver Street, and spread the fire far and wide so that the whole neighborhood was set ablaze. The explosion shattered windows a mile away and was heard as far away as Sandy Hook, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|As {{recorded}} in the 2013 census, the largest Māori iwi is Ngāpuhi with 125,601 people (or 18.8 percent of people of Māori descent). Since 2006, {{the number of people}} of Māori descent stating Ngāpuhi as their iwi increased by 3,390 people (2.8percent). The second-largest was Ngāti Porou, with 71,049 <b>people</b> (<b>down</b> 1.2percent from 2006). Ngāi Tahu was the largest in the South Island and the third-largest overall, with a count of 54,819 people (an increase of 11.4percent from 2006). A total of 110,928 people (or 18.5percent) of Māori descent did not know their iwi (an increase of 8.4percent compared with 2006). A group of Māori migrated to Rēkohu, now known as the Chatham Islands, where they developed their distinct Moriori culture. The Moriori population was decimated, first, by disease brought by European sealers and whalers and, second, by Taranaki Māori, with only 101 surviving in 1862 and the last known full-blooded Moriori dying in 1933. The number of people identifying as having Moriori descents increased from 105 in 1991 to 945 in 2006, but decreased to 738 in 2013.|$|E

5|$|Mulder {{brings a}} {{cockroach}} {{from the hotel}} room to Berenbaum, who thinks it may be mechanical. Mulder then visits the nearby Dr. Ivanov, a wheelchair-bound scientist who works on insect-like robots. The two discuss the possibility that extraterrestrial intelligences could send robotic probes to study other planets. After inspecting the Mulder's specimen, Ivanov is rendered speechless; he informs Mulder that the specimen is, technology-wise, vastly superior to anything he's ever seen. Scully arrives in the town at a convenience store, finding the residents succumbing to panic over the roaches. She attempts to calm the <b>people</b> <b>down,</b> however the store-goers frantically flee after two scuffling patrons knock over a display of chocolate candies, believing {{them to be more}} roaches. Meanwhile, Mulder, while departing Ivanov's lab, catches another roach to bring to Berenbaum, but this time, she concludes that it is a seemingly normal cockroach. Scully finds out that Eckerle was researching dung-derived methane as an alternative fuel source, and had been importing animal dung that may have introduced the roaches to the area. Upon hearing this, Mulder speculates that the roaches are actually extraterrestrial robotic probes that are capable of consuming dung—an abundant resource already exploited by some species of roaches—to generate methane as a source of fuel.|$|E

Colonel Wilford disobeyed this order, which meant there was no separation between rioters and peaceful marchers.|$|E

Methods We measured these variables cross-sectionally in a Dutch sample (22 to 62 [*]years of age) of 68 institutionalised <b>people</b> with <b>Down</b> syndrome. Results The scores on all the variables except one of the temperament scales were found to decline gradually with increasing age, but deterioration of episodic memory started earlier.

Furthermore, the data suggested that immediate memory impairment is one of the earliest signs of the disease in <b>people</b> with <b>Down</b> syndrome, just {{as it is in the}} general population...|$|R

25|$|Primitive Methodism {{was also}} shaped by Bourne's joint {{concern for the}} spiritual {{salvation}} and social welfare of ordinary working people. For example, just like Keir Hardie {{in the early twentieth}} century, Bourne understood that drunkenness was a major factor which kept working-class <b>people</b> <b>down</b> in base conditions. Also, In the face of establishment opposition, Bourne promoted working class education, including instruction in reading, writing and arithmetic, in addition to religious teaching, at the Primitive Methodist Sunday Schools. Many early trade union pioneers were drawn from the ranks of Primitive Methodist Preachers, and a basic 'welfare state' used to operate among chapel-goers, their neighbours and families. In common with some other non-conformists, Bourne accepted women as of equal status with men by (amongst other things) appointing women Preachers.|$|E

25|$|The {{buildings}} of the campus were designed by internationally renowned Modernist architect Paul Rudolph {{beginning in the early}} 1960s, to distinguish the campus from the outside world and provide what might be considered a Social Utopian environment. The building architecture {{is similar to that of}} the Boston Government Service Center. Rudolph made both the exterior and interior of each building of rough concrete (béton brut), an essential element of the style known as Brutalism, and he endowed buildings with large windows, with the intended effect of giving those inside the feeling of being connected to the outdoors. The stairs were made relatively short in height, ostensibly in order to slow <b>people</b> <b>down</b> and thus allow them to appreciate the campus more fully. Atriums were also placed in the Liberal Arts and Science & Engineering buildings to give people a place to socialize between sections of the halls. These areas are also filled with hanging and potted indoor plants. The main door of each building faces towards the Robert Karam Campanile, keeping students within the academic life area, where buildings for classes are located. Large mounds of earth (berms) also stand between the parking lots, making the lots partially invisible from within the original Academic Life area (though not from within some recent additions to it, such as the Charlton College of Business building). More recent buildings, most notably the Woodland Commons and residence halls to the south of the main campus, have been built to complement, but not to attempt to copy, Rudolph's Late Modernist aesthetic.|$|E
