5|$|Body {{tissue samples}} from Eurasian sparrowhawks are still {{analysed}} {{as part of}} the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme conducted by the UK government's Joint Nature Conservation Committee. Although the average liver concentrations of <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>biphenyls</b> (<b>PCBs)</b> in Eurasian sparrowhawks were lower in birds that died in 2005 compared to those that died in 2004, there was not a significant or consistent decline in residues between 2000–2005.|$|E
5|$|Despite heavy fishing {{pressure}} {{within its}} range, the cloudy catshark remains common, {{perhaps because it}} may be more biologically productive than most other sharks. As a result, it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Cloudy catsharks from a number of locations off Japan {{have been found to be}} contaminated with <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>biphenyls</b> (<b>PCBs)</b> and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDEs), which they acquire from their food. One likely source of these pollutants is the use of the pesticide DDT by developing nations in southern Asia.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, James Dahlgren {{and colleagues}} {{published}} a small-sample pilot study assessing the project. Dahlgren {{is a doctor}} who promotes the Purification Rundown {{as a method of}} detoxification. The study claimed to find evidence both of elevated levels of <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>biphenyls</b> (<b>PCBs)</b> and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) in the rescue workers and improvement during the regime. Two scientists from Cambridge Environmental, Inc. published a thorough critique of the study. They questioned the premise that WTC rescue workers needed detoxification, citing studies that had found that their blood concentration of toxins was no greater than normal.|$|E

5|$|Another {{important}} {{application of}} samarium {{and its compounds}} is as catalyst and chemical reagent. Samarium catalysts assist decomposition of plastics, dechlorination of pollutants such as <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>biphenyls</b> (<b>PCBs),</b> {{as well as the}} dehydration and dehydrogenation of ethanol. Samarium(III) triflate (Sm(OTf)3, that is Sm(CF3SO3)3), {{is one of the most}} efficient Lewis acid catalysts for a halogen-promoted Friedel–Crafts reaction with alkenes. Samarium(II) iodide is a very common reducing and coupling agent in organic synthesis, for example in the desulfonylation reactions; annulation; Danishefsky, Kuwajima, Mukaiyama and Holton Taxol total syntheses; strychnine total synthesis; Barbier reaction and other reductions with samarium(II) iodide.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other animals}} {{at the highest}} trophic levels, the killer whale is {{particularly}} at risk of poisoning from bioaccumulation of toxins, including <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>biphenyls</b> (<b>PCBs).</b> European harbor seals have problems in reproductive and immune functions associated {{with high levels of}} PCBs and related contaminants, and a survey off the Washington coast found PCB levels in killer whales were higher than levels that had caused health problems in harbor seals. Blubber samples in the Norwegian Arctic show higher levels of PCBs, pesticides and brominated flame-retardants than in polar bears. When food is scarce, killer whales metabolize blubber for energy, which increases pollutant concentrations in their blood.|$|E
5|$|Wary {{and quick}} to flee, leopard sharks pose almost no danger to humans. There {{is a single}} record from 1955 of a leopard shark harassing a skin diver with a nosebleed, though no {{injuries}} resulted. This species is caught by commercial fisheries using gillnets and longlines, and by recreational anglers and spearfishers; it is also caught as bycatch in bottom trawls. The meat is considered excellent eating and is sold fresh or frozen. However, leopard sharks living alongside human development may accumulate pollutants such as mercury, pesticides, and <b>polychlorinated</b> <b>biphenyls</b> (<b>PCBs)</b> within their bodies, and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife warns against eating them regularly. The leopard shark is prized by the aquarium trade for its attractive appearance and hardiness; this led to many newborn pups being captured with hook-and-line off southern California in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It may live for over 20 years in captivity.|$|E

25|$|The {{product of}} the {{polymerization}} process is unmodified PVC.
