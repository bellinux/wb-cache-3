5|$|Because {{the balance}} of {{payments}} sums to zero, a current account surplus indicates a deficit in the asset accounts and vice versa. A current account surplus or deficit indicates {{the extent to which}} a country is relying on foreign capital to finance its consumption and investments, and whether it is living beyond its means. For example, assuming a capital account balance of zero (thus no asset transfers available for financing), a current account deficit of £1 billion implies a financial account surplus (or net asset exports) of £1 billion. A net exporter of financial assets is known as a borrower, exchanging future payments for current consumption. Further, a net export of financial assets indicates growth in a country's debt. From this perspective, {{the balance of}} payments links a nation's income to its spending by indicating the degree to which current account imbalances are financed with domestic or foreign financial capital, which illuminates how a nation's wealth is shaped over time. A healthy balance of <b>payments</b> <b>position</b> is important for economic growth. If countries experiencing a growth in demand have trouble sustaining a healthy balance of payments, demand can slow, leading to: unused or excess supply, discouraged foreign investment, and less attractive exports which can further reinforce a negative cycle that intensifies payments imbalances.|$|E

50|$|Suppose {{the number}} of {{countries}} in the world is n. Because this world is closed, one country's balance of payments surplus must be equal to another's deficit, and vice versa. Thus the sum of all countries' net <b>payments</b> <b>positions</b> must be zero. Therefore, if n &minus; 1 countries out of n countries have determined their balances of payments, that of the nth country is determined automatically. This fact implies that, if all of the n countries have payments objectives, only n &minus; 1 countries can achieve the payments objectives. In other words, all of the payments objectives can not be achieved simultaneously.|$|R

5000|$|For the Anglo-American economies, Keynesian {{economics}} typically was {{not officially}} rejected {{until the late}} 1970s or early 1980s. Formal rejection was generally preceded by several years of the adoption of monetarist policies aiming to reduce inflation, which tended to counteract any expansionary fiscal policies that continued to be employed until Keynesianism was formally discarded. [...] In Britain Keynesian economics was officially rejected by Margaret Thatcher's new government in 1979, ending the Post-war consensus. There had been initial unsuccessful attempts to establish free market favouring policies as early as 1970 {{by the government of}} Edward Heath. In 1976, market participants began speculating against the pound, even though at the time both inflation and Britain's Balance of <b>payments</b> <b>position</b> was improving. Eric Helleiner cites a number of sources to suggest the speculation related to the growing influence of Monetarism and opposition to Keynesian policy by the increasing powerful market players. After suffering a currency crises, Britain needed to turn to the IMF. The IMF was now much less Keynesian {{than it had been in}} previous years, and only agreed to provide the required financing if Britain agreed to implement an austerity package. Shortly after, the then Prime Minister, James Callaghan, stated that [...] "spending our way out of recession" [...] is no longer an option. According to Skidelsky, Callaghan's statement is widely seen as marking the end of the Keynesian age. [...] In the US it was Reaganomics that fully displaced Keynesianism in 1981, again this had been preceded by a significant movement in the direction of monetarism by President Jimmy Carter's 1979 appointment of Paul Volcker as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. In Australia and New Zealand the era of Keynesianism was ended by the election victories of prime ministers Bob Hawke (1983) and David Lange (1984) respectively, though in both cases Keynesian economics had already to some extent fallen out of favour.|$|E
