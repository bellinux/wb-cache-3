5|$|By 1977, Greene was {{the captain}} of the Steelers defense, {{although}} his reduced effectiveness over the previous two seasons due to injuries led to rumors that he was washed up. He was never again able to attain the same success as a <b>pass</b> <b>rusher</b> after his pinched nerve in 1975. Spurred by the rumors, he returned in 1978 to lead all Pittsburgh linemen in tackles, and he had four sacks and a career-high five fumble recoveries. The Steelers defense allowed a league-low 195 points during the season, en route to a 35–31 victory over the Cowboys in Super Bowl XIII. In that contest, Greene had one of Pittsburgh's five sacks of Dallas quarterback Roger Staubach.|$|E
25|$|Five {{plays into}} the Jets' next drive, Patriots cornerback Jason Webster forced Cotchery to fumble a 9-yard reception; Guyton {{recovered}} the fumble at the Patriots' 40-yard line. The Patriots next possession featured an entirely shotgun, no-huddle offense, with a 17-yard Cassel scramble moving the Patriots back into Jets territory. Four plays later, a 47-yard Gostkowski field goal tied the game. Starting {{from their own}} 33-yard line after the Patriots directed the kickoff to linebacker David Bowens instead of to Washington, the Jets began {{what would be a}} 14-play drive with just over 10 minutes left in the game. The Jets then moved the ball to the Patriots' 7-yard line to set up a 3rd-and-7 with 3:38 left in the game. Favre's pass intended to Cotchery fell incomplete, but Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel was called for a defensive holding penalty, giving the Jets an automatic first down from the Patriots' 3-yard line. The Jets failed to score on two straight runs, while the Patriots used two timeouts to stop the clock after each play. On the third rushing attempt, Thomas Jones scored from a yard out to give the Jets a 31–24 lead with 3:10 left in the game. Cassel was sacked on second down of the Patriots' next drive, forcing them to punt on three-and-out but not having to use their timeout until the Jets' next possession, when they used it in conjunction with the two-minute warning to get the ball back with 1:04 left in the game after a Jets punt. Starting from their own 38-yard line, the Patriots moved to the Jets' 42-yard line on two Cassel completions; a spike stopped the clock at :36. A 17-yard Welker catch and another spike then put the Patriots at the Jets' 25-yard line with :23 left. A Koppen false start moved the Patriots back 5 yards, but a 14-yard Welker catch and another spike put the Patriots on the Jets' 16-yard line with 8 seconds to go. On the ensuing play, Moss was covered by former Patriots cornerback Ty Law, who returned to the Jets for a second stint with the team just days earlier after sitting out the first 10 weeks of the season. As Cassel eluded a <b>pass</b> <b>rusher</b> and moved into the flat, Moss looked for the pass from the near corner of the end zone. Cassel threw to Moss, who caught the pass just beyond the near pylon and fell out of bounds, giving the Patriots a 16-yard touchdown with 1 second remaining in the game. A booth review was called but determined Moss did indeed have possession and the necessary footing before he fell out of bounds, upholding the touchdown call and sending the game into overtime after the extra point.|$|E
500|$|In his {{two seasons}} at Alabama, Cody helped the Crimson Tide {{to lead the}} Southeastern Conference in rushing defense, {{allowing}} opponents a rushing average of only 78.8 and 78.1 yards per game in 2008 and 2009, respectively. No individual player reached the 100-yard rushing mark against the Crimson Tide in those two seasons; Anthony Dixon of Mississippi State came closest with 81 yards in 2009. Cody's presence improved Alabama's pass rush despite his not being an effective <b>pass</b> <b>rusher</b> himself. Wrote Michael Casagrande: [...] "The power that comes with his size typically forces opposing lines to focus two players on blocking him, thus creating favorable rushing lanes for unblocked linebackers." ...|$|E

500|$|Marshall's {{emergence}} as a <b>pass</b> <b>rusher</b> continued in 1985 as he racked up 15.5 sacks, earning him {{a trip to the}} Pro Bowl and recognition as NFL defensive lineman of the year. [...] Marshall repeated both honors in 1986, teaming up with Hall of Fame linebacker Lawrence Taylor to form a potent pass rush {{on the right side of}} the Giants defense. [...] He finished the year with 12 sacks, helping the Giants to a 14-2 record and an appearance in Super Bowl XXI to face off against the Denver Broncos. [...] Marshall recorded two sacks in the Giants 39-20 victory, earning him his first Super Bowl ring.|$|E
500|$|Some pro scouts, however, were {{concerned}} about Cody's weight and said he needed to reduce it to [...] {{in order to be}} an effective NFL player. They questioned whether he had the stamina to be a three-down player, or the quickness to be an effective <b>pass</b> <b>rusher,</b> at his college weight of about [...] ESPN′s K. C. Joyner analyzed Cody's relative playing time in a four-game SEC stretch in October 2009 (at Kentucky, at Mississippi, vs. South Carolina, vs. Tennessee), and found that Cody was in the Alabama defensive lineup on only 122 of 281 plays. Joyner also discovered that during that stretch Cody drew an impressively high amount of double-teams: 63.6 percent, compared to NFL player Albert Haynesworth's 2007 double-team mark of 51.3 percent.|$|E
500|$|Some regard Youngblood, who was {{considered}} to be an excellent <b>pass</b> <b>rusher,</b> as the best defensive lineman in Gators history as well {{as one of the top}} five players in the University of Florida's football program. When Time magazine chose him for their 1970 All-America Team, it said of Youngblood: [...] "Deceptively fast for his size, he reads screens and swing passes so adroitly that he intimidates quarterbacks by his mere presence." [...] His coach Doug Dickey told The Sporting News, [...] "He is difficult to move when you run at him, has the speed and agility to pursue down the line of scrimmage, and the strength and quickness to rush the passer." [...] In one of a series of articles written for The Gainesville Sun in 2006, Youngblood was ranked as the No. 5 all-time greatest player for the Florida Gators.|$|E

500|$|Ford {{continued}} to excel as a pass-rusher in 1951, when the Browns again {{advanced to the}} NFL Championship Game but lost to the Rams. He recovered four fumbles during the season and was named a first-team All-Pro by both the Associated Press (AP) and the United Press International (UPI). He was also named to the Pro Bowl, the NFL's all-star game. Ford's dominating play allowed Brown to assign him to two offensive linemen, giving Cleveland the latitude to put four men {{on the line and}} use three linebackers in what is now known as the 4–3 defense. Cleveland's defensive coach Blanton Collier later recalled the thinking behind moving Ford: [...] "We knew we had to get him in closer where his talents as a <b>pass</b> <b>rusher</b> could best be utilized. [...] So we moved both tackles in and dropped the linebackers off the outside. [...] It may have been the beginning of today's 4–3 defense." [...] Collier also noted that [...] "Len was very aggressive and had that touch of meanness in him that you find in most defensive players." ...|$|E
500|$|With wind gusts {{reaching}} , coach Bill Parcells {{chose to}} take the wind when his team won the opening coin toss of the Giants' NFC Championship Game against the Washington Redskins. With the wind at their backs the Giants scored 10 first quarter points while the Redskins managed only two first downs. The Redskins were forced to punt {{three times in the}} quarter, and the wind limited those punts to 23, 27, and 24 yards. The Redskins launched a drive behind Jay Schroeder's 48-yard completion to wide receiver Art Monk in the second quarter. However, after the Redskins botched the field goal snap on a 51-yard field goal attempt, the Giants drove for a touchdown with the wind in their face to make the score 17–0 at halftime. The Giants defense dominated the second half, and both teams went scoreless to make the final score 17–0. Schroeder completed only 20 of 50 passes for a meager 3.8yards per attempt. Keys to the victory were tackle Brad Benson's neutralizing of Redskins <b>pass</b> <b>rusher</b> Dexter Manley, who had 18.5 sacks on the season, and the team's defense. After the game, John Madden remarked: [...] "Last year, I thought the Bears had the best defense I had ever seen. But in the last two weeks, I feel these Giants have as good a defense as has ever played in this league." ...|$|E
500|$|Although used {{primarily}} as a backup and special teams player during his first three seasons, Slater became the starting right tackle in 1979. That year the Rams went to Super Bowl XIV, where he successfully defended L. C. Greenwood from getting a quarterback sack. In 1980, he {{was a part of}} an offensive line that surrendered just 29 sacks and helped the Rams’ offense finish second in the NFL in total yards gained with 6,006. In 1983, he and the Rams offensive line demonstrated their versatility when they allowed a league-low 23 sacks while also paving the way for Eric Dickerson’s rookie rushing record of 1,808 yards. In 1985, he was the key blocker for Dickerson as he ran for a playoff record 248 yards and two touchdowns against the Dallas Cowboys in a NFL divisional game. [...] During a 1989 playoff game, Slater prevented Reggie White, who was considered the premium <b>pass</b> <b>rusher</b> in the NFL, from sacking the quarterback, a game that Slater later became best known for. Slater was considered by critics the most consistent lineman on one of the best offensive lines in the NFL, which also included Pro Bowlers Kent Hill and Dennis Harrah and was recognized for his [...] "work ethic and leadership skills" [...] when he was inducted to the Hall of Fame. He retired after the 1995 season when injuries reduced him to playing one game the entire year. He is the only player in league history to play for one single team/franchise in three different cities (Los Angeles 1976-1979, Anaheim 1980-1994, and St. Louis 1995) ...|$|E

2500|$|The main {{strength}} of the Raiders was their defense, nicknamed [...] "The 11 Angry Men". The defensive line was anchored by Pro Bowlers Tom Keating and Ben Davidson. Davidson was an extremely effective <b>pass</b> <b>rusher</b> who had demonstrated his aggressiveness in a regular season game against the New York Jets by breaking the jaw of Jets quarterback Joe Namath while sacking him. Behind them, Pro Bowl linebacker Dan Conners excelled at blitzing and pass coverage, recording 3 interceptions. The Raiders also had two Pro Bowl defensive backs: Willie Brown, who led the team with 7 interceptions, and Kent McCloughan, who had 2 interceptions. Safety Warren Powers recorded 6 interceptions, returning them for 154 yards and 2 touchdowns.|$|E
2500|$|The Colts defense led the NFL in fewest points allowed (144, {{tying the}} then all-time league record), and ranked third in total rushing yards allowed (1,339).

Linebacker Mike Curtis was {{considered one of}} the top linebackers in the NFL. Baltimore's secondary consisted of defensive backs Bobby Boyd (8 interceptions), Rick Volk (6 interceptions), Lenny Lyles (5 interceptions), and Jerry Logan (3 interceptions). The Colts were the only NFL team to routinely play a zone defense. That gave them an advantage in the NFL because the other NFL teams were inexperienced against a zone defense. (This would not give them an advantage over the upstart New York Jets, however, because zone defenses were common in the AFL and the Jets knew how to attack them.) ...|$|E

However, in the 1985 Supplemental draft, the Eagles acquired the rights to Memphis Showboats' elite <b>pass</b> <b>rusher</b> Reggie White. In 1986, the arrival of head coach Buddy Ryan and his fiery attitude rejuvenated team performance and ignited the fan base, but the Eagles failed to win a playoff game during Ryan's tenure. Possibly the worst of these losses was the so-called Fog Bowl in 1988 against the Chicago Bears, which happened to be Ryan's former team that he helped lead to a Super Bowl XX victory as defensive coordinator. [...] Ryan was fired on January 7, 1991, after an upset home playoff loss to the Redskins. Offensive coordinator Rich Kotite was promoted to head coach three days later.|$|E
