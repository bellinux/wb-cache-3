5|$|Current {{limitations}} to p-doping limit electronic and optoelectronic applications of ZnO, which usually require junctions of n-type and <b>p-type</b> material. Known <b>p-type</b> dopants include group-I elements Li, Na, K; group-V elements N, P and As; {{as well as}} copper and silver. However, many of these form deep acceptors and do not produce significant <b>p-type</b> conduction at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the year}} 2000, {{there was a}} wave of {{attempts}} to dope synthetic CVD diamond films by sulfur aiming at n-type conductivity with low activation energy. Successful reports have been published, but then dismissed as the conductivity was rendered <b>p-type</b> instead of n-type and associated not with sulfur, but with residual boron, which is a highly efficient <b>p-type</b> dopant in diamond.|$|E
5|$|Silicon carbide is a semiconductor, {{which can}} be doped n-type by {{nitrogen}} or phosphorus and <b>p-type</b> by beryllium, boron, aluminium, or gallium. Metallic conductivity has been achieved by heavy doping with boron, aluminium or nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|Transparent {{thin-film}} transistors (TTFT) can {{be produced}} with ZnO. As field-effect transistors, they even may not need a p–n junction, thus avoiding the <b>p-type</b> doping problem of ZnO. Some of the field-effect transistors even use ZnO nanorods as conducting channels.|$|E
5|$|Boron nitride can be doped <b>p-type</b> with {{beryllium}} and n-type with boron, sulfur, silicon or if co-doped {{with carbon}} and nitrogen. Both hexagonal and cubic BN are wide-gap semiconductors with a band-gap energy {{corresponding to the}} UV region. If voltage is applied to h-BN or c-BN, then it emits UV light in the range 215–250nm and therefore can potentially be used as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or lasers.|$|E
5|$|The Wilson's disease gene (ATP7B) {{has been}} mapped to {{chromosome}} 13 (13q14.3) and is expressed {{primarily in the}} liver, kidney, and placenta. The gene codes for a <b>P-type</b> (cation transport enzyme) ATPase that transports copper into bile and incorporates it into ceruloplasmin. Mutations can be detected in 90% of cases. Most (60%) are homozygous for ATP7B mutations (two abnormal copies), and 30% have only one abnormal copy. Ten percent have no detectable mutation.|$|E
5|$|VP4 is on {{the surface}} of the virion that {{protrudes}} as a spike. It binds to molecules {{on the surface of}} cells called receptors and drives the entry of the virus into the cell. VP4 has to be modified by the protease enzyme trypsin, which is found in the gut, into VP5* and VP8* before the virus is infectious. VP4 determines how virulent the virus is and it determines the <b>P-type</b> of the virus.|$|E
5|$|Irregular moons {{are small}} {{satellites}} with large-radii, inclined, and frequently retrograde orbits, {{believed to have}} been acquired by the parent planet through a capture process. They often occur as collisional families or groups. The precise size as well as albedo of the irregular moons are not known for sure because the moons are very small to be resolved by a telescope, although the latter is usually assumed to be quite low—around 6% (albedo of Phoebe) or less. The irregulars generally have featureless visible and near infrared spectra dominated by water absorption bands. They are neutral or moderately red in color—similar to C-type, <b>P-type,</b> or D-type asteroids, though they are much less red than Kuiper belt objects.|$|E
5|$|Boron is {{a useful}} dopant for such {{semiconductors}} as silicon, germanium, and silicon carbide. Having one fewer valence electron than the host atom, it donates a hole resulting in <b>p-type</b> conductivity. Traditional method of introducing boron into semiconductors is via its atomic diffusion at high temperatures. This process uses either solid (B2O3), liquid (BBr3), or gaseous boron sources (B2H6 or BF3). However, after the 1970s, it was mostly replaced by ion implantation, which relies mostly on BF3 as a boron source. Boron trichloride gas {{is also an important}} chemical in semiconductor industry, however not for doping but rather for plasma etching of metals and their oxides. Triethylborane is also injected into vapor deposition reactors as a boron source. Examples are the plasma deposition of boron-containing hard carbon films, silicon nitride-boron nitride films, and for doping of diamond film with boron.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds {{containing}} boron as a substitutional impurity are termed type IIb. Only {{one percent}} of natural diamonds are of this type, and most are blue to grey. Boron is an acceptor in diamond: boron atoms have one less available electron than the carbon atoms; therefore, each boron atom substituting for a carbon atom creates an electron hole in the band gap that can accept an electron from the valence band. This allows red light absorption, and due to the small energy (0.37 eV) needed for the electron to leave the valence band, holes can be thermally released from the boron atoms to the valence band even at room temperatures. These holes can move in an electric field and render the diamond electrically conductive (i.e., a <b>p-type</b> semiconductor). Very few boron atoms are required for this to happen—a typical ratio is one boron atom per 1,000,000 carbon atoms.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic diamond has {{potential}} uses as a semiconductor, {{because it can}} be doped with impurities like boron and phosphorus. Since these elements contain one more or one less valence electron than carbon, they turn synthetic diamond into <b>p-type</b> or n-type semiconductor. Making a p–n junction by sequential doping of synthetic diamond with boron and phosphorus produces light-emitting diodes (LEDs) producing UV light of 235nm. Another useful property of synthetic diamond for electronics is high carrier mobility, which reaches 4500cm2/(V·s) for electrons in single-crystal CVD diamond. High mobility is favourable for high-frequency operation and field-effect transistors made from diamond have already demonstrated promising high-frequency performance above 50GHz. The wide band gap of diamond (5.5 eV) gives it excellent dielectric properties. Combined with the high mechanical stability of diamond, those properties are being used in prototype high-power switches for power stations.|$|E
25|$|When {{placed in}} the sun, photons of the {{sunlight}} can excite electrons on the <b>p-type</b> side of the semiconductor, {{a process known as}} photoexcitation. In silicon, sunlight can provide enough energy to push an electron out of the lower-energy valence band into the higher-energy conduction band. As the name implies, electrons in the conduction band are free to move about the silicon. When a load is placed across the cell as a whole, these electrons will flow out of the <b>p-type</b> side into the n-type side, lose energy while moving through the external circuit, and then flow back into the <b>p-type</b> material where they can once again re-combine with the valence-band hole they left behind. In this way, sunlight creates an electric current.|$|E
25|$|This {{structure}} with <b>p-type</b> body {{is the basis}} of the n-type MOSFET, which requires the addition of n-type source and drain regions.|$|E
25|$|Electron-donating (n-type) dopants {{can also}} be used to create {{conductive}} polyacetylene. n-Type dopants for polyacetylene include lithium, sodium, and potassium. As with <b>p-type</b> dopants, charge-transfer complexes are created, where the polymer backbone is anionic and the donor is cationic. The increase in conductivity upon treatment with an n-type dopant is not as significant as those achieved upon treatment with a <b>p-type</b> dopant. Polyacetylene chains doped with n-type dopants are extremely sensitive to air and moisture.|$|E
25|$|A p–n {{junction}} diode {{is made of}} a crystal of semiconductor, usually silicon, but germanium and gallium arsenide are also used. Impurities are added to it to create a region on one side that contains negative charge carriers (electrons), called an n-type semiconductor, and a region {{on the other side}} that contains positive charge carriers (holes), called a <b>p-type</b> semiconductor. When the n-type and <b>p-type</b> materials are attached together, a momentary flow of electrons occur from the n to the p side resulting in a third region between the two where no charge carriers are present. This region is called the depletion region because there are no charge carriers (neither electrons nor holes) in it. The diode's terminals are attached to the n-type and <b>p-type</b> regions. The boundary between these two regions, called a p–n junction, is where the action of the diode takes place. When a sufficiently higher electrical potential is applied to the P side (the anode) than to the N side (the cathode), it allows electrons to flow through the depletion region from the N-type side to the <b>P-type</b> side. The junction does not allow the flow of electrons in the opposite direction when the potential is applied in reverse, creating, in a sense, an electrical check valve.|$|E
25|$|It has {{a shallow}} P+ implant in N type {{diffusion}} layer over a <b>P-type</b> epitaxial substrate layer. It {{is used in}} CMOS Active pixel sensor.|$|E
25|$|The first {{heterojunction}} diode lasers were single-heterojunction lasers. These lasers utilized aluminum {{gallium arsenide}} <b>p-type</b> injectors situated over n-type gallium arsenide layers grown on the substrate by LPE. An admixture of aluminum replaced gallium in the semiconductor crystal {{and raised the}} bandgap of the <b>p-type</b> injector over that of the n-type layers beneath. It worked; the 300 K threshold currents went down by 10× to 10,000 amperes per square centimeter. Unfortunately, this was still not in the needed range and these single-heterostructure diode lasers did not function in continuous wave operation at room temperature.|$|E
25|$|Some sources define silicon-controlled {{rectifier}} (SCR) and thyristor as synonymous. Other sources define thyristors as {{a larger}} set of devices {{with at least}} four layers of alternating N and <b>P-type</b> material.|$|E
25|$|A bipolar {{junction}} transistor (bipolar transistor or BJT) {{is a type of}} transistor that uses both electron and hole charge carriers. In contrast, unipolar transistors, such as field-effect transistors, only use one kind of charge carrier. For their operation, BJTs use two junctions between two semiconductor types, n-type and <b>p-type.</b>|$|E
25|$|For {{soldering}} semiconductor materials, e.g. {{die attachment}} of silicon, germanium and gallium arsenide, {{it is important}} that the solder contains no impurities that could cause doping in the wrong direction. For soldering n-type semiconductors, solder may be doped with antimony; indium may be added for soldering <b>p-type</b> semiconductors. Pure tin and pure gold can be used.|$|E
25|$|A {{point-contact}} diode works {{the same as}} the junction diodes described below, but its construction is simpler. A pointed metal wire is placed in contact with an n-type semiconductor. Some metal migrates into the semiconductor to make a small <b>p-type</b> region around the contact. The 1N34 germanium version is still used in radio receivers as a detector and occasionally in specialized analog electronics.|$|E
25|$|At {{standard}} temperature and pressure, silicon is a shiny semiconductor with a bluish-grey metallic lustre; as typical for semiconductors, its resistivity drops with temperature. This arises because silicon {{has a small}} energy gap between its highest occupied energy levels (the valence band) and the lowest unoccupied ones (the conduction band). The Fermi level is about halfway between these and is the energy at which a state is {{as likely to be}} occupied by an electron as not. Hence pure silicon is an insulator at room temperature. However, doping silicon with a pnictogen such as phosphorus, arsenic, or antimony introduces one extra electron per dopant and these may then be excited into the conduction band either thermally or photolytically, creating an n-type semiconductor. Similarly, doping silicon with a group 13 element such as boron, aluminium, and gallium results in the introduction of acceptor levels that trap electrons that may be excited from the filled valence band, creating a <b>p-type</b> semiconductor. Joining n-type silicon to <b>p-type</b> silicon creates a p-n junction with a common Fermi level; electrons flow from n to p, while holes flow from p to n, creating a voltage drop. This p-n junction thus acts as a diode that can rectify alternating curent that allows current to pass more easily one way than the other. A transistor is an n-p-n junction, with a thin layer of weakly <b>p-type</b> silicon between two n-type regions. Biasing the emitter through a small forward voltage and the collector through a large reverse voltage allows the transistor to act as a triode amplifier.|$|E
25|$|The {{diversity}} of the crystal structures of rare-earth borides results in interesting physical properties and potential applications in thermopower generation. Thermal conductivity of boron icosahedra based compounds is low because of their complex crystal structure; this property is favored for thermoelectric materials. On the other hand, these compounds exhibit very low (variable range hopping type) <b>p-type</b> electrical conductivity. Increasing the conductivity is a key issue for thermoelectric applications of these borides.|$|E
25|$|While 1985 {{was to be}} {{the last}} year of the second {{generation}} model, delays in production of the third generation model led to a surplus of second generation Supras. During the first half of 1986 the 1985 <b>P-type</b> was still offered for sale, with only minor cosmetic changes as well as the addition of a now mandatory rear-mounted third brake light on the hatch. These were all labelled officially as 1986 models. P-types were the only model available in 1986.|$|E
25|$|Dye sensitised {{solar cells}} {{operate as a}} photoanode (n-DSC), where {{photocurrent}} result from electron injection by the sensitized dye. Photocathodes (p-DSCs) operate in an inverse mode compared to the conventional n-DSC, where dye-excitation is followed by rapid electron transfer from a <b>p-type</b> semiconductor to the dye (dye-sensitized hole injection, instead of electron injection). Such p-DSCs and n-DSCs can be combined to construct tandem solar cells (pn-DSCs) and the theoretical efficiency of tandem DSCs is well beyond that of single-junction DSCs.|$|E
25|$|Generally, strong delocalization in a solid due {{to large}} overlap with {{neighboring}} wave functions {{means that there}} will be a large Fermi velocity; this means that the number of electrons in a band is less sensitive to shifts in that band's energy, implying a weak magnetism. This is why s- and <b>p-type</b> metals are typically either Pauli-paramagnetic or as in the case of gold even diamagnetic. In the latter case the diamagnetic contribution from the closed shell inner electrons simply wins from the weak paramagnetic term of the almost free electrons.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{triazine}} derivate that inhibits voltage-sensitive sodium channels, {{leading to}} stabilization of neuronal membranes. It also blocks L-, N-, and <b>P-type</b> calcium channels and has weak 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) receptor inhibition. These actions {{are thought to}} inhibit release of glutamate at cortical projections in the ventral striatum limbic areas, and its neuroprotective and antiglutamatergic effects have been pointed out as promising contributors to its mood stabilizing activity. Observations that lamotrigine reduced γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor-mediated neurotransmission in rat amygdala, suggest that a GABAergic mechanism may also be involved, although this concept is controversial.|$|E
25|$|These consist {{essentially}} of a 3–5mm thick {{silicon junction}} type p-i-n diode (same as PIN diode) with a bias of −1000 V across it. The lithium-drifted centre part forms the non-conducting i-layer, where Li compensates the residual acceptors which would otherwise make the layer <b>p-type.</b> When an X-ray photon passes through, it causes {{a swarm of}} electron-hole pairs to form, and this causes a voltage pulse. To obtain sufficiently low conductivity, the detector must be maintained at low temperature, and liquid-nitrogen cooling must {{be used for the}} best resolution. With some loss of resolution, the much more convenient Peltier cooling can be employed.|$|E
25|$|Balanced charge {{injection}} {{and transfer}} {{are required to}} get high internal efficiency, pure emission of luminance layer without contaminated emission from charge transporting layers, and high stability. A common way to balance charge is optimizing {{the thickness of the}} charge transporting layers but is hard to control. Another way is using the exciplex. Exciplex formed between hole-transporting (<b>p-type)</b> and electron-transporting (n-type) side chains to localize electron-hole pairs. Energy is then transferred to luminophore and provide high efficiency. An example of using exciplex is grafting Oxadiazole and carbazole side units in red diketopyrrolopyrrole-doped Copolymer main chain shows improved external quantum efficiency and color purity in no optimized OLED.|$|E
25|$|La2O3 has a {{band gap}} at {{approximately}} 5.8 eV. It {{has the lowest}} lattice energy, with very high dielectric constant, ε = 27. La2O3 is widely used in industry {{as well as in}} the research laboratory. Lanthanum oxide is an odorless, white solid that is insoluble in water, but soluble in dilute acid. Depending on the pH of the compound, different crystal structures can be obtained. La2O3 is hygroscopic; under atmosphere, lanthanum oxide absorbs moisture over time and converts to lanthanum hydroxide. Lanthanum oxide has <b>p-type</b> semiconducting properties. Its resistivity decreases with an increase in temperature. Its average room temperature resistivity is 10 kΩ·cm.|$|E
25|$|Lehovec tested {{his idea}} using the {{technologies}} of making transistors {{that were available}} at Sprague. His device was a linear structure 2.2×0.5×0.1mm in size, which was divided into isolated n-type cells (bases of the future transistors) by p-n junctions. Layers and transitions were formed by growth from the melt. The conductivity type {{was determined by the}} pulling speed of the crystal: an indium-rich <b>p-type</b> layer was formed at a slow speed, whereas an arsenic-rich n-type layer was produced at a high speed. The collectors and emitters of the transistors were created by welding indium beads. All electrical connections were made by hand, using gold wires.|$|E
25|$|In typical operation, the base–emitter {{junction}} is forward biased, {{which means}} that the p-doped side of the junction is at a more positive potential than the n-doped side, and the base–collector junction is reverse biased. In an NPN transistor, when positive bias is applied to the base–emitter junction, the equilibrium is disturbed between the thermally generated carriers and the repelling electric field of the n-doped emitter depletion region. This allows thermally excited electrons to inject from the emitter into the base region. These electrons diffuse through the base from the region of high concentration near the emitter towards the region of low concentration near the collector. The electrons in the base are called minority carriers because the base is doped <b>p-type,</b> which makes holes the majority carrier in the base.|$|E
25|$|Neurotransmitter {{release is}} {{dependent}} on an external supply of Ca2+ ions which enter axon terminals via voltage-gated calcium channels. Vesicular fusion with the terminal membrane and release of the neurotransmitter {{is caused by the}} generation of Ca2+ gradients induced by incoming action potentials. The Ca2+ ions cause the mobilization of newly synthesized vesicles from a reserve pool to undergo this membrane fusion. This mechanism of action was discovered in squid giant axons. Lowering intracellular Ca2+ ions provides a direct inhibitory effect on neurotransmitter release. After release of the neurotransmitter occurs, vesicular membranes are recycled to their origins of production. Calcium ion channels can vary depending on the location of incidence. For example, the channels at an axon terminal differ from the typical calcium channels of a cell body (whether neural or not). Even at axon terminals, calcium ion channel types can vary, {{as is the case with}} <b>P-type</b> calcium channels located at the neuromuscular junction.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} many types of PV systems known to be effective, {{crystalline}} silicon PV accounted for around 90% of the worldwide production of PV in 2013. Manufacturing silicon PV systems has several steps. First, polysilicon is processed from mined quartz until it is very pure (semi-conductor grade). This is melted down when small amounts of Boron, a group III element, are added to make a <b>p-type</b> semiconductor rich in electron holes. Typically using a seed crystal, an ingot of this solution is grown from the liquid polycrystalline. The ingot may also be cast in a mold. Wafers of this semiconductor material are cut from the bulk material with wire saws, and then go through surface etching before being cleaned. Next, the wafers are placed into a phosphorus vapor deposition furnace which lays a very thin layer of phosphorus, a group V element, which creates an N-type semiconducting surface. To reduce energy losses an anti-reflective coating {{is added to the}} surface, along with electrical contacts. After finishing the cell, cells are connected via electrical circuit according to the specific application and prepared for shipping and installation.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} {{conductive}} channel formed by gate-to-source voltage no longer connects source to drain during saturation mode, carriers are not blocked from flowing. Considering again an n-channel enhancement-mode device, a depletion region {{exists in the}} <b>p-type</b> body, surrounding the conductive channel and drain and source regions. The electrons which comprise the channel are free {{to move out of}} the channel through the depletion region if attracted to the drain by drain-to-source voltage. The depletion region is free of carriers and has a resistance similar to silicon. Any increase of the drain-to-source voltage will increase the distance from drain to the pinch-off point, increasing the resistance of the depletion region in proportion to the drain-to-source voltage applied. This proportional change causes the drain-to-source current to remain relatively fixed, independent of changes to the drain-to-source voltage, quite unlike its ohmic behavior in the linear mode of operation. Thus, in saturation mode, the FET behaves as a constant-current source rather than as a resistor, and can effectively be used as a voltage amplifier. In this case, the gate-to-source voltage determines the level of constant current through the channel.|$|E
500|$|Reliable <b>p-type</b> doping of ZnO remains difficult. This problem {{originates}} {{from low}} solubility of <b>p-type</b> dopants and their compensation by abundant n-type impurities. This problem is observed with GaN and ZnSe. Measurement of <b>p-type</b> in [...] "intrinsically" [...] n-type material {{is complicated by}} the inhomogeneity of samples.|$|E
