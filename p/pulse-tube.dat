40|$|In recent years, {{much effort}} has been {{directed}} toward the optimization of <b>Pulse-Tube</b> Cryo-coolers (PTCs) using advanced modeling techniques such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD). These CFD models have been demonstrated to qualitatively predict the processes that one would expect in a PTC. However, for these models to become useful and accepted as design tools, precise experimental data from actual PTC systems are required for validation. More specifically, detailed measurements of the regenerator loss, acoustic power flow at the cold end, cooling power, phase angles and the instantaneous pressure and mass flows are required to thoroughly validate an ad-vanced CFD model. This paper discusses the design and construction of an experimental test facility {{that is capable of}} directly measuring these quantities. The purpose of the test facility is to provide validation of CFD models of the pulse tube component within a PTC as well as sophisticated regenerator models. Therefore, the test facility has been designed so that the regenerator loss is decoupled from and measured independent of the <b>pulse-tube</b> loss. The mass flow and pressure at the cold end are measured {{in order to determine the}} acoustic power flow entering the <b>pulse-tube</b> component. The acoustic power measurement, coupled with measurement of the gross cooling power and the regen-erator loss, allows the loss in the <b>pulse-tube</b> component to be determined and provides direct vali-dation of the CFD model that predicts the efficiency of the <b>pulse-tube</b> component with respect to converting acoustic power into useful cooling.

To achieve the unprecedented levels of sensitivity required, these experiments use arrays of superconducting Transition Edge Sensor (TES) bolometers that are cooled to sub-Kelvin temperatures for photon-noise limited performance. These TES detectors are read out using low- noise SQUID amplifiers. To rapidly test these detectors and similar devices in a laboratory setting, we constructed a cryogenic refrigeration chain consisting of a commercial two-stage <b>pulse-tube</b> cooler, with a base temperature of 3 K, and a closed-cycle 3 He/ 4 He/ 3 He sorption cooler, with a base temperature of 220 mK.

40|$|Two {{improvements}} in heat-transfer design {{have been investigated}} with a view toward increasing the efficiency of refrigerators used to liquefy gases. The improvements could {{contribute to the development}} of relatively inexpensive, portable oxygen liquefiers for medical use. A description of the heat-transfer problem in a <b>pulse-tube</b> refrigerator is prerequisite to a meaningful description of the first improvement. In a <b>pulse-tube</b> refrigerator in particular, one of in-line configuration heat must be rejected from two locations: an aftercooler (where most of the heat is rejected) and a warm heat exchanger (where a small fraction of the total input power must be rejected as heat). Rejection of heat from the warm heat exchanger can be problematic because this heat exchanger is usually inside a vacuum vessel. When an acoustic-inertance tube is used to provide a phase shift needed in the <b>pulse-tube</b> cooling cycle, another problem arises: Inasmuch as the acoustic power in the acoustic-inertance tube is dissipated over the entire length of the tube, the gas in the tube must be warmer than the warm heat exchanger in order to reject heat at the warm heat exchanger. This is disadvantageous because the increase in viscosity with temperature causes an undesired increase in dissipation of acoustic energy and an undesired decrease in the achievable phase shift. Consequently, the overall performance of the <b>pulse-tube</b> refrigerator decreases with increasing temperature in the acoustic-inertance tube. In the first improvement, the acoustic-inertance tube is made to serve as the warm heat exchanger and to operate in an approximately isothermal condition at a lower temperature, thereby increasing the achievable phase shift and the overall performance of the refrigerator. This is accomplished by placing the acoustic-inertance tube inside another tube and pumping a cooling fluid (e. g., water) in the annular space between the tubes. Another benefit of this improvement is added flexibility of design to locate the warm heat-rejection components outside the vacuum vessel. The second improvement is the development of a compact radial-flow condenser characterized by a very high heat transfer coefficient and a small pressure drop...|$|E

Recent {{developments in the}} field of high Tc superconductors spawned a wide range of applications such as terahertz sensors, SQUIDS, low noise amplifiers, filters for microwave applications and many more. These devices are typically, nondissipating and require a cryocooler delivering refrigeration power of about 10 mW operating at 80 K.

The original motivation was to maintain Dave Reagor`s high-temperature superconducting electronics at 75 K, but the study has evolved to include three target design criteria: cooling at 30 C in a 300 C environment, cooling at 75 K in a 50 C environment, cooling at both 75 K and 30 C in a 250 C environment.

40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. The typical low-frequency <b>pulse-tube</b> {{refrigerator}} loses significant {{cooling power}} {{when it is}} tipped with the pulse tube’s cold end above its hot end, because natural convection in the pulse tube loads the cold heat exchanger. Yet most high-frequency <b>pulse-tube</b> refrigerators work well in any orientation with respect to gravity. In such a refrigerator, natural convection is suppressed by sufficiently fast velocity oscillations, via a nonlinear hydrodynamic effect that tends to align the density gradients in the pulse tube parallel to the oscillation direction. Since gravity’s tendency to cause convection is only linear in the pulse tube’s end-to-end temperature difference while the oscillation’s tendency to align density gradients with oscillating velocity should be quadratic in that temperature difference, it is easiest to suppress convection when the end-to-end temperature difference is largest. Simple experiments demonstrate this temperature dependence, the strong dependence on the oscillating velocity, and little or no dependence on the magnitude or phase of the oscillating pressure. In some circumstances in this apparatus, the suppression of convection is a hysteretic function of oscillating velocity. In some other circumstances, a time-dependent convective state seems more difficult to suppres...|$|E
