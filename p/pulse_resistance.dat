When a user picked up the telephone handset, the resulting line loop operating the user's line relay caused the exchange to connect the user's telephone to an originating sender, which returned the user a dial tone. The sender then recorded the dialed digits and passed them to the originating marker, which selected an outgoing trunk and operated the various crossbar switch stages to connect the calling user to it.

The symmetric device {{is one in which}} the electrode shape, size, composition, and deposition processing are identical. We show that under certain limitations of pulse switching voltage, such a symmetric electrical <b>pulse</b> induced <b>resistance</b> change device can exhibit either no net device resistance switching at room temperature, or bipolar switching with the resistance hysteresis curve exhibiting a "table leg" structure. The resistance measurements are made using surface scanning Kelvin probe microscopy, which allows for the measurement of the profile of resistance from one electrode, across the Pr 0. 7 Ca 0. 3 MnO 3 material and into the second electrode, both before resistance switching and after switching. The results show that resistance switching in the symmetric device occurs primarily in the interface region within about 1 to 3 micron of the electrical contact surface. Resistance switching is also observed in the bulk Pr 0. 7 Ca 0. 3 MnO 3 material although at a lower level. Symmetry considerations for a two terminal symmetric device that can switch resistance are discussed, and the data reported here is consistent with the symmetric model previously developed.

As a result, {{it was found that}} the enough heating of the graphite dies that contacts with zirconia powder, and heat transmission from the die to zirconia powder was essential for the success of the sintering with adequate density. Moreover, the lower density region was found at the inside of the can during the process, which corresponded to the region where the convex shape formed in experiments. Furthermore, the high tensile residual circumferential stress was observed at the side wall from the simulation of the cooling process, which is caused by the different thermal expansion ratio of the graphite and zirconia materials.

In order to investigate the effect of double pulsing, the steel was exposed to single and various double pulse RSW schedules. The first current pulse was applied to create the weld nugget, while the second current pulse generated a secondary weld nugget and annealed or (partial) re-melted the primary weld nugget, depending on {{the magnitude of the}} current. The effect of the second current pulse on the weld nugget and heat-affected zone characteristics was investigated using optical microscopy and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). Optical and electron microscopy revealed that the secondary weld nugget is fully martensitic, showing a typical solidification microstructure, while the annealed zone reveals an equi-axed martensitic structure. EPMA results showed that elemental segregation has been considerably reduced in the annealed zone. Mechanical properties of the welds show that the AHSS studied is prone to weld metal failure for single pulse RSW. However, the double pulse RSW method can lead to significantly improved mechanical performance and favourable failure modes. MSE- 5 Materials Science and Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|AbstractSixteen out-of-hospital {{survivors}} of ventricular fibrillation underwent a prospective, randomized, intraoperative comparison of sequential pulse and single pulse defibrillation {{with use of}} two distinct electrode systems and waveform shapes currently available for clinical use. Defibrillation was tested alternately with either the single pulse or the sequential pulse system 10 s into an episode of ventricular fibrillation. Sequential pulse defibrillation was performed with two 4 ms truncated exponential pulses of constant duration delivered to three equally spaced oval epicardial patch electrodes composed of concentric coils. The posterior left ventricular electrode served as the common cathode. The first anode was over the anterior right ventricle and the second anode was over the anterior left ventricle. Single pulse defibrillation was performed with the standard intracardiac defibrillation system with use of a single truncated exponential pulse with a fixed 65 % tilt delivered across two rectangular, wire mesh epicardial patch electrodes positioned over the anterior right ventricle and posterolateral left ventricle. During defibrillation threshold determination, voltage and current waveforms were recorded and used to determine <b>pulsing</b> <b>resistance</b> and delivered and stored energy. Average defibrillation threshold leading edge voltage for the single pulse technique was 273 ± 101 V compared with 246 ± 67 V (11 % less) for the sequential pulse technique (p = 0. 136). Defibrillation threshold leading edge current for the single pulse technique was 6. 7 ± 2. 5 A compared with 5. 2 ± 1. 7 A (29 % less) for the sequential pulse method (p = 0. 005). The defibrillation threshold delivered energy was 5. 6 ± 4. 0 J for the single pulse technique and 3. 5 ± 1. 8 J (38 % less) for the sequential pulse technique (p = 0. 021). The defibrillation threshold stored energy for the single pulse technique was 6. 3 ± 4. 3 J compared with 4. 0 ± 2. 0 J (37 % less) for the sequential pulse technique (p = 0. 013).

The extracorporeal circulation circuit consisted of a centrifugal pump, silicone tubings with an inner diameter of 6 mm, a roller pump, and a reservoir. The placenta was the sole oxygenator. Cardiopulmonary bypass was maintained at a mean flow rate of 344 ± 68 mL/kg/min, including 30 minutes of cardiac arrest and 15 minutes of reperfusion.

A decrease in partial pressure of oxygen with concomitant increase in carbon dioxide partial pressure was noted, but trends were relatively stable.
