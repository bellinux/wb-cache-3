5|$|By World War I, all of {{the major}} powers were experimenting with {{aircraft}} mounted cannon; however their low rate of fire and great size and weight precluded any of them from being anything other than experimental. The most successful (or least unsuccessful) was the SPAD 12 Ca.1 with a single 37mm Puteaux mounted to fire between the cylinder banks and through the <b>propeller</b> <b>boss</b> of the aircraft's Hispano-Suiza 8C. The pilot (by necessity an ace) had to manually reload each round.|$|E
25|$|It {{made its}} maiden flight in August 1935, {{powered by a}} 720hp (537kW) Hispano-Suiza 9Vbrs radial engine. With this engine it reached a speed of 352km/h (219mph). In October that year it was re-engined with a 680hp (507kW) Hispano-Suiza 14Hbrs radial in a NACA cowling, {{increasing}} the speed and the floats were modified. It was re-engined again in October 1937 with a 900hp (671kW) Hispano-Suiza 12Ycrs-1 V12 engine with a 20mm cannon firing through the <b>propeller</b> <b>boss.</b> Despite reaching 400km/h (248mph), faster {{than any of the}} other competitors, the R.90 was not ordered into production, 20 Loire 210s being purchased instead.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was a small}} single-bay biplane with {{constant}} chord wings of no stagger. There was dihedral on the lower plane only. Full span ailerons were fitted on both upper and lower wings. [...] The lower wing was mounted {{on the bottom of}} the fuselage and the upper one well clear of the head of the pilot, who sat under it in an open cockpit. [...] The wings folded as the competition rules required them to do for ease of storage. [...] The fuselage was deep for its width and carried a conventional, rather square cut empennage with unbalanced control surfaces. [...] The single-axle undercarriage was braced to the front and rear wing spars at the roots, the legs splayed out to broaden the track. [...] A 750 cc Douglas motorcycle engine was mounted horizontally, with the cylinder heads protruding either side below the <b>propeller</b> <b>boss.</b>|$|E
5000|$|There was no {{fuselage}} in {{the conventional}} sense, rather a nacelle for pilot and engine {{and a number of}} rearward booms to carry the tail. The nacelle was flat sided and just wide enough to accommodate the pilot, who sat under flexible glazing below {{the leading edge of the}} upper wing. It was a steel-framed, fabric-covered structure. The nose of the aircraft was easily removable to give access to the rear of the instrument panel. [...] Behind the pilot was a small baggage hold, externally accessed and the 40 hp (30 kW) Praga B2 two-cylinder engine was at the rear of the nacelle, driving a two-bladed pusher <b>propeller</b> with its <b>boss</b> only just below the upper wing. [...] Two horizontal steel booms converged from that wing, just inboard of the interplane struts to the tips of the tailplane. Three more beams spread out from the base of the nacelle upwards, the outer pair joining those from the upper wing forming the tailplane extremities and the central one supporting the rudder and inner tailplane. Thus the tailplane had angular tips and a straight leading edge, and the elevators had a triangular cut out for rudder movement. Because of the short length of these booms the fin and rudder, both of which extended above and below the tailplane had to be generous in area. The tail surfaces were fabric covered over a wooden structure. [...] The main undercarriage was mounted on splayed, sprung and faired legs attached to the rear of the nacelle plus vertical long stroke shock absorbers. [...] The stearable nosewheel had the same diameter as the main wheels.|$|R
5000|$|... {{compression}} ratio 5.3:1, geared at 0.75:1. The HS-36 was the 8B with a Lewis gun firing through the <b>propeller</b> <b>boss.</b>|$|E
50|$|The C.V was Albatros Flugzeugwerke's first {{revision}} of their B- and C-type reconnaissance aircraft since Ernst Heinkel left the firm for Hansa-Brandenburg. While retaining {{the same basic}} layout as the Heinkel-designed aircraft, the C.V featured considerably refined streamlining. The forward fuselage was skinned in sheet metal and a neat, rounded spinner covered the <b>propeller</b> <b>boss.</b> Power {{was provided by the}} new Mercedes D.IV, a geared eight-cylinder engine.|$|E
50|$|Self-sustaining motor gliders (often {{known as}} 'turbos') are fitted with small {{two-stroke}} engines with no starting system, for ground testing a cord is {{wrapped around the}} <b>propeller</b> <b>boss</b> and pulled rapidly in conjunction with operating decompressor valves. These engines are started in flight by operating the decompressor and increasing airspeed to windmill the propeller. Early variants of the Slingsby Falke motor glider use a cockpit mounted pull start system.|$|E
50|$|The first {{engine was}} finally ready for {{operation}} in 1946. The Army contracted for another four examples. Around this time a turboprop version was proposed, the XT35 Typhoon. This was a fairly simple adaptation of the J37, adding a fifth turbine stage {{at the rear of}} the engine, containing a radial turbine that drove the pusher propeller and exited the exhaust around the outer rim of the engine. An alternate arrangement would send the exhaust through an opening in the <b>propeller</b> <b>boss.</b> In September 1947 Lockheed finally threw in the towel and sold the design to Wright Aeronautical.|$|E

5000|$|Fonck, like France's leading ace, Capt. Guynemer, flew a limited-production SPAD XII fighter, {{distinguished}} {{by the presence}} of a hand-loaded 37mm Puteaux cannon firing through the <b>propeller</b> <b>boss.</b> He is apparently credited with downing 11 German airplanes with this type of armament, called a [...] "moteur-canon". This was made possible by the gear-reduction version of the Hispano-Suiza V8 SOHC engine first used in that model of SPAD fighter. It offset the now-hollow propeller shaft above the crankshaft axis, and the 37mm cannon was mounted in the V space between the two rows of cylinders. Fonck would later fly the highly successful SPAD XIII, which was the first SPAD fighter model to use twin Vickers machine guns.|$|E
5000|$|... 8BeC (HS-38): The 8Be {{fitted with}} the 37 mm SAMC Model 37 cannon, {{or a similar}} weapon, firing through the <b>propeller</b> <b>boss.</b> A {{reduction}} gear equipped power-plant with a resultant clockwise rotation propeller like the 8B, produced [...] at 2,100 rpm. Two known weapons fitted were the SAMC with a rifled barrel and a smooth-bore cannon firing canister ammunition. The moteur-canon could fire a single shot at a time through the hollow drive shaft without propeller interference. This cannon mount required an [...] "elevated" [...] intake manifold design, bringing the intake [...] "runners" [...] straight off the inner surfaces of the cylinder banks to the updraft carburetor's plenum chamber. The engine was used on the SPAD S.XII.|$|E
50|$|It {{was a small}} single-bay biplane with {{constant}} chord wings of no stagger. There was dihedral on the lower plane only. Full span ailerons were fitted on both upper and lower wings.

A 750 cc Douglas motorcycle engine was mounted horizontally, with the cylinder heads protruding either side below the <b>propeller</b> <b>boss.</b>|$|E
50|$|The DH.34 had a wooden, plywood-clad fuselage, {{with the}} cockpit (for two pilots) being {{positioned}} {{ahead of the}} wings and the passenger cabin. It had two-bay wooden wings and was powered by a Napier Lion engine, which was fitted for inertia starting, avoiding the necessity for hand swinging of the propellor to start the engine. Unusually {{the design of the}} aircraft allowed an entire spare engine to be carried on board across the rear of the passenger cabin. The cabin door's unusual shape was to allow the engine to be loaded and unloaded, and a specially-fitted 'porthole' {{on the other side of}} the cabin would be removed to allow the <b>propeller</b> <b>boss</b> to protrude out the side of the aircraft. Spare engines were not carried routinely (the DH.34's payload was too low to carry both passengers and a spare engine) but this facility was used by operators to quickly fly spare engines out to aircraft that had suffered breakdown.|$|E
50|$|Joining {{these two}} parts into an {{aircraft}} took two people {{a little over}} half an hour. The steering wheel stowed {{in the car and}} the bumper in the rear fuselage, then the car was backed into the fuselage opening and linked to the wings by attaching on each side a single lift strut to a bracket on the lower car body. This positioned the windscreen at the wing leading edge and the side windows enclosed the cabin. Entry was via standard car-type, forward hinged doors. Removing the grille revealed a <b>propeller</b> <b>boss</b> and the propeller was bolted on. The Vespa 400 had been modified so that the front wheels could be swung downward and forward on V struts, forming the Autoplanes's narrow track main undercarriage. Its rear suspension was also modified to allow the wheels to be retracted upwards into the body. After a flight, this procedure was reversed, releasing the car to the road.|$|E
5000|$|In {{general terms}} the Bolton {{was similar to}} the Bourges, though larger all round; both were twin-engined, three bay biplanes with equal span, {{constant}} chord wings with no sweep or stagger. [...] Both carried ailerons on upper and lower wings, though the wingtips of the Bolton were cut off square in the later Boulton & Paul fashion and lacked the protruding balances of the earlier machine. The interplane struts were quite wide chord, their twin triangular members covered in fabric. There were supporting sloping struts from the midpoints of the wing midsection to the upper fuselage longerons. The two 450 hp (336 kW) Napier Lion engines were mounted just inboard of the inner interplane struts, not directly onto the lower wing but rather on (for the top part of the engine was uncovered for air cooling) a little nacelle which had at the front and below the <b>propeller</b> <b>boss,</b> a small radiator. Four-bladed propellers were fitted.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{documented}} {{installation of}} a cannon on an aircraft was on the Voisin Canon in 1911, displayed at the Paris Exposition that year.By World War I, {{all of the major}} powers were experimenting with aircraft mounted cannon; however their low rate of fire and great size and weight precluded any of them from being anything other than experimental. The most successful (or least unsuccessful) was the SPAD 12 Ca.1 with a single 37mm Puteaux mounted to fire between the cylinder banks and through the <b>propeller</b> <b>boss</b> of the aircraft's Hispano-Suiza 8C. The pilot (by necessity an ace) had to manually reload each round.The first autocannon were developed during World War I as anti-aircraft guns, and one of these - the Coventry Ordnance Works [...] "COW 37 mm gun" [...] was installed in an aircraft but the war ended before it could be given a field trial and never became standard equipment in a production aircraft. Later trials had it fixed at a steep angle upwards in both the Vickers Type 161 and the Westland C.O.W. Gun Fighter, an idea that would return later.During this period autocannons became available and several fighters of the German Luftwaffe and the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service were fitted with 20mm cannon. They continued to be installed as an adjunct to machine guns rather than as a replacement, as the rate of fire was still too low and the complete installation too heavy. There was a some debate in the RAF as to whether the greater number of possible rounds being fired from a machine gun, or a smaller number of explosive rounds from a cannon was preferable. Improvements during the war in regards to rate of fire allowed the cannon to displace the machine gun almost entirely. The cannon was more effective against armour so they were increasingly used during the course of World War II, and newer fighters such as the Hawker Tempest usually carried two or four versus the six [...]50 Browning machine guns for US aircraft or eight to twelve M1919 Browning machine guns on British aircraft. The Hispano-Suiza HS.404, Oerlikon 20 mm cannon, MG FF, and their numerous variants became among the most widely used autocannon in the war. cannon, as with machine guns, were generally fixed to fire forwards (mounted in the wings, in the nose or fuselage, or in a pannier under either); or were mounted in gun turrets on heavier aircraft. Both the Germans and Japanese mounted cannon to fire upwards and forwards for use against heavy bombers, with the Germans calling guns so-installed Schräge Musik. Schräge Musik derives from the German colloquialism for Jazz Music (the German word schräg literally means slanted or oblique) ...|$|E
40|$|Marine organisms {{accumulate}} on {{the surface}} of propeller and ship-hull, while ships are at anchor in a harbour. The accumulation of marine organisms causes decreasing of propulsive efficiency of the ships. In case of the Kagoshima-Maru, the propeller had to be cleaned by a diver three times a year. To prevent the accumulation of marine organisms, <b>propeller</b> <b>boss</b> and blades were coated by special paint, which is made of silicone resin. Observations were carried out for one year by measuring shaft horse power, and by photographing work using submersible video camera. The results were obtained as follows: 1) Coating propeller with silicone resin paint, was effective for the prevention of marine organism 2 ̆ 7 s accumulation, so that propeller cleaning work done by the diver can be neglected. 2) The cost of propeller coating was about a half of the wages paid for the diver. 3) It seems that the adhesion of the paint was not strong enough, because about a half area of the propeller coating was removed during the experiment.

40|$|Economic {{pressures}} and regulatory requirements have {{brought about a}} great interest in improving ship propulsion efficiency. This can be exercised by installing Energy Saving Devices (ESD) such as <b>Propeller</b> <b>Boss</b> Cap Fins (PBCF). This paper demonstrates an approach for optimising PBCF by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis. The conducted CFD open water model tests were validated by comparison with experimental data until the simulation was deemed satisfactory within the capabilities and limitations of the model. A design and optimisation procedure was defined to analyse the impact of ESDs on propeller efficiency and then used to evaluate the different geometric parameters and locations of the PBCF on the hub. This analysis was done at full scale using high fidelity CFD - based RANS methods. Outcomes of the study include a design and optimisation process {{that can be used for}} the analysis of other ESDs on the market. The influences of varying the geometry of the PBCF were examined with optimal solutions presented for the analysis case. The impact on the regulated Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and ESD savings were then discussed along with the influences on the energy efficiency...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the simulated and experimental results of propeller-rudder systems with <b>propeller</b> <b>boss</b> cap fins (PBCFs) and analyzes the hydrodynamic performance of PBCFs in propeller-rudder systems. The {{purpose is to}} study the impact of PBCFs on the hydrodynamic performance of rudders. Hydrodynamic experiments were carried out on propeller-rudder systems with PBCFs in a cavitation tunnel. The experimental energy-saving effect of the PBCF without a rudder was 1. 47 % at the design advance coefficient J[*]=[*] 0. 8. The numerical simulation {{was based on the}} Navier–Stokes equations solved with a sliding mesh and the SST (Shear Stress Transfer) k-ω turbulence model. After the grid independence analysis, the flow fields of an open-water propeller with and without a PBCF were compared, then the efficiencies of the propulsion systems including different rudders and the thrust coefficient Kr of rudders were analyzed. The results indicate that the installation of a PBCF increases the resistance of the rudder, which results in a reduction in the energy-saving effect of the PBCF. At the design advance coefficient, the energy-saving effect of the PBCF with an ordinary rudder and a twisted rudder decreases from 1. 47 % to 1. 08 % and 1. 16 %, respectively; thus, it is important to factor in the rudder of a propulsion system when evaluating the energy-saving effects of PBCFs...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTThe global {{price of}} oil, {{which is both}} finite and limited in quantity, has been rising {{steadily}} because of the increasing requirements for energy in both developing and developed countries. Furthermore, regulations have been strengthened across all industries to address global warming. Many studies of hull resistance, propulsion and operation of ships have been performed {{to reduce fuel consumption}} and emissions. This study examined the design parameters of the <b>propeller</b> <b>boss</b> cap fin (PBCF) and hub cap for 6, 000 TEU container ships to improve the propulsion efficiency. The design parameters of PBCF have been selected based on the geometrical shape. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis with a propeller open water (POW) test was performed to check the validity of CFD analysis. The design of experiment (DOE) case was selected as a full factorial design, and the experiment was analyzed by POW and CFD analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine the correlation among design parameters. Four design alternatives of PBCF were selected from the DOE. The shape of a propeller hub cap was selected as a divergent shape, and the divergent angle was determined by the DOE. Four design alternatives of PBCF were attached to the divergent hub cap, and the POW was estimated by CFD. As a result, the divergent hub cap with PBCF has a negative effect on the POW, which is induced by an increase in torque coefficient. A POW test and cavitation test were performed with a divergent hub cap with PBCF to verify the CFD result. The POW test result showed that the open water efficiency was increased approximately 2 % with a divergent hub cap compared to a normal cap. The POW test result was similar to the CFD result, and the divergent hub cap with the PBCF models showed lower open water efficiency. This was attributed to an increase in the torque coefficient just like the CFD results. A cavitation test was performed using the 2 models selected. The test result showed that the hub vortex is increased downstream of the propeller...|$|E
