5|$|British rule in Nyasaland radically {{altered the}} local {{indigenous}} power structures. The early colonial period saw some immigration and settlement by white colonists, who bought large swathes of territory from local chiefs, often for token payments in beads or guns. Most {{of the land}} acquired, particularly in the Shire Highlands, was converted into white-owned plantations where tea, coffee, cotton and tobacco were grown. The enforcement of colonial institutions, such as the Hut Tax, compelled many indigenous <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> paid work {{and the demand for}} labour created by the plantations, led to their becoming a major employer. Once employed on the plantations, black workers found that they were frequently beaten and subject to racial discrimination. Increasingly, the plantations were also forced to rely on a system of forced labour or corvée, known locally at the thangata.|$|E
5|$|Now in {{possession}} of the antidote, UNITY needs the list of infected <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out who administered it, during which Cate believes that the real mastermind behind H.A.R.M.'s events is the Baron's wife, Baroness Felicity Dumas, who {{is believed to be}} {{in possession}} of the list. Later, Cate heads to the Dumas' château located in the German Alps. While there, she is knocked unconscious by Armstrong, who spares her life by locking her in a cell. The Baroness gloats at Cate about her plans to take over the world and leaves. Cate then provokes Armstrong into an ensuing fist fight. After being defeated, Armstrong agrees to let Cate go, and defects H.A.R.M. by telling her where the list is located. Cate then realizes that she was infected after being knocked unconscious by Wagner in Hamburg days ago. The Baroness mentions that Wagner must have set the count-down to 10 days instead of 10 hours. Eventually, Cate obtains another antidote and later, the list located in the Baroness's hidden lair.|$|E

25|$|According to Where's the Learning in Service Learning? by Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, {{immersing}} oneself {{into service}} learning and serving others has many positive effects both academic and personal. Not only does surrounding oneself with new people and {{learning how to}} work together as a group help one improve teamwork and relational skills, it reduces stereotypes, increases appreciation of other cultures, and works to allow young <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> others that they relate to.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the end of}} World War II, {{the major}} port city of San Francisco had been home to a sizable number of LGBT people {{expelled}} from the military who decided to stay rather than return to their hometowns and face ostracism. In addition to those outed militarily there were arguably many more who successfully remained closeted, left voluntarily when able to or never entered the service in the first place. San Francisco's history as a more pluralistic culture allowed for LGBT <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> employment and housing; being a tourism and entertainment destination also meant that more creative- and service-oriented work was available.|$|E
25|$|Moral aridity, the {{hypocrisy}} of contemporary life and the inability of <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> happiness in traditional ways such as love and marriage are the regnant themes {{in the works of}} Alberto Moravia. Usually, these conditions are pathologically typical of middle-class life; marriage is the target of works such as Disobedience and L'amore coniugale (Conjugal Love, 1949). Alienation is the theme in works such as Il disprezzo (Contempt or A Ghost at Noon. 1954) and La noia (The Empty Canvas) from the 1950s, despite observation from a rational-realistic perspective. Political themes are often present: an example is La Romana (The Woman of Rome, 1947), the story of a prostitute entangled with the Fascist regime and with a network of conspirators. The extreme sexual realism in La noia (The Empty Canvas, 1960) introduced the psychologically experimental works of the 1970s.|$|E

25|$|A {{day prior}} to the summit, traffic {{restrictions}} were imposed in Sardar Patel Marg so as to allow proper movement of the visiting dignitaries. Such restrictions were expected to affect traffic at major city roads, India Gate and Rajiv Chowk. However, despite an earlier announcement stating that restrictions would be imposed in the evening, the restrictions were placed by the afternoon. As a result, commuters were left stranded due to traffic blocks. Despite advisories from the police, there was confusion on the roads. Some people {{reported that they were}} held up at the roads for several hours. The blocked roads were also used by commuters travelling from satellite towns into Delhi, thus forcing the <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> alternate options for traveling. The Delhi Police's advice of avoiding the blocked routes and finding alternate routes was met with criticism as such measures would add considerably to commuting time. Commuter displeasure was also expressed on social networking sites like Facebook. The traffic conditions in the city made many commuters use the Delhi Metro to reach their destinations.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the centuries}} the Bana-Mighdallian weapons and {{services}} became above par {{and were in}} much demand. This way of living continued until the late 20th century. It was into this period that Artemis was born. As a child, Artemis was raised in poverty among her tribe, running naked through barren hills and often hungry. By {{the time she was}} 10 years old she was trained to carry 50lbs. packs silently across night battlefields. At one point in her teens she briefly left her <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a new life in Man's World, allying with Ra's al Ghul as he launched a plan to decimate the world with stolen nuclear missiles acquired {{with the aid of a}} salvaged Bizarro, claiming to be eighteen rather than fourteen and proving herself as a trained warrior by defeating several of Ra's forces. After being defeated by Batman- although her ability to hold her own against him when she was only fourteen was still impressive-, Artemis eventually turned against Ra's after leading him to Themyscira with the intention of allowing him to use it as a base, realising during the attack that she could not cause the deaths of her own people. She returned home after being inspired by a brief meeting with Superman, opting to return to a life of relative tranquility.|$|E

500|$|Kavner {{was then}} {{cast as a}} sidekick to Tracey Ullman in The Tracey Ullman Show, which debuted on Fox in 1987. Kavner {{described}} the show as, [...] "like being back in school, {{a chance to play}} a wide variety of characters, some really vicious people, to not rest on laurels, to not play it safe". Kavner commented, [...] "What I do is not mimicry or an impersonation, but more of an assimilation. [...] {{we did a lot of}} looking at <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out who to base our characters on. We did our homework on our lunch hour." [...] She received four Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Best Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program.|$|E

500|$|The {{film has}} been {{interpreted}} as being grounded in Christian mysticism. Andy is offered as a messianic, Christ-like figure, with Red describing him early in the film as having an aura that engulfs and protects him from Shawshank. The scene in which Andy and several inmates tar the prison roof {{can be seen as}} a recreation of the Last Supper, with Andy obtaining beer/wine for the twelve inmates/disciples as Freeman describes them as the [...] "lords of all creation" [...] invoking Jesus' blessing. Darabont responded that this was not his deliberate intention, but he wanted <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> their own meaning in the film. The discovery of The Marriage of Figaro record is described in the screenplay as akin to finding the Holy Grail, bringing the prisoners to a halt, and causing the sick to rise up in their beds.|$|E
500|$|Tracy {{appeared}} in four movies in 1937. They Gave Him a Gun went largely unnoticed, but Captains Courageous {{was one of}} the major film events of the year. Tracy played a Portuguese fisherman in the adventure movie, based on the novel by Rudyard Kipling. He was uncomfortable feigning a foreign accent, and resented having his hair curled, but the role was a hit with audiences and Tracy won the Academy Award for Best Actor. Captains Courageous was followed by Big City with Luise Rainer and Mannequin with Joan Crawford, the latter of which took good billings at the box office. With two years of hit movies and industry recognition, Tracy became a star in the United States. A 1937 poll of 20 million <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the [...] "King and Queen of Hollywood" [...] ranked Tracy sixth among males. Tracy was reunited with Gable and Loy for 1938's Test Pilot. The film was another commercial and critical success, permanently cementing the notion of Gable and Tracy as a team.|$|E
500|$|Seth navigates {{the city}} on foot—cars, bicycles, and public {{transportation}} rarely even appear–as he talks with friends or rifles through used book shops. [...] For literary theorist Barbara Postema, the character fits the archetype of Walter Benjamin's flâneur—the wandering urban pedestrian {{out of touch with}} his own time and obsessed with the past. [...] Seth pines for a past not his own and obsessively collects consumer items from earlier in the 20th century. [...] His focus is primarily on the period from the 1930s to the 1950s, a time he feels particularly [...] "Canadian". [...] He goes as far as to wear an old-fashioned overcoat and broad-rimmed hat, for which passing teenagers taunt him, saying he looks like Clark Kent or Dick Tracy. [...] He declares to Chester: [...] "I do think life was simpler then... easier for <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> personal happiness." [...] Brown disagrees, saying, [...] "I think it's always been difficult for people to be happy." [...] Seth dreads the future and allows his memories of childhood to dominate his thoughts, but recognizes and criticizes his own obsessions: [...] "There's something in the decay of old things that provokes an evocative sadness for the vanished past. [...] If those buildings were perfectly preserved it wouldn't be the same." [...] Despite this consciousness, he continues to pursue his collecting.|$|E

500|$|Although his {{appearance}} {{as a domestic}} pet is mostly a cover, Perry has nonetheless expressed care and devotion for the Flynn-Fletcher family. In the episode [...] "The Ballad of Bad Beard", Perry managed to drag Candace out of the Dark Cave before it caved in because of Dr. Doofenshmirthz's [...] "self destruction button" [...] that which Candace had accidentally pressed while under the orange moss hallucination, thinking it was a vending machine. He did this {{even though he knew}} that Candace saw that Perry was a secret agent talking to Agent E (Eagle) and to Major Monogram in a cracked egg. Candace thought she was just hallucinating because of the orange moss she accidentally touched earlier in the episode. Also, when an invention of Doofenshmirtz's in the episode [...] "Journey to the Center of Candace" [...] might cause severe harm to Phineas and Ferb, Perry thoroughly beats up Doofenshmirtz and quickly handcuffs him. He then ties him to a pipe and, instead of just leaving him like he usually does in the series, calls for special forces from the O.W.C.A. to come and arrest the doctor, though they never show up. In [...] "Oh, There You Are, Perry," [...] Doofenshmirtz is downgraded to a low threat level and Perry is reassigned to a new nemesis. This causes him to have to leave his home with the Flynn-Fletchers, which makes him sad and he does not enjoy his new villain. Phineas and Ferb are fearful about where Perry could have gone to and put up several flyers around town for <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> him. They decide to throw a concert on the roof of a building, singing a song about how much they love Perry and want him to come home. Concurrently, Perry is reassigned to Doofenshmirtz again and returns to the brothers once more.|$|E
