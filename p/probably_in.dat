5|$|Another, short {{wall was}} added in later times, <b>probably</b> <b>in</b> {{the reign of}} Theophilos, {{stretching}} from the junction {{of the land and}} sea walls to the sea itself, and pierced by the so-called Wooden Gate (Ξυλίνη πύλη, Xylinē pylē, or Ξυλόπορτα, Xyloporta). Both this wall and the gate were demolished in 1868.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{composed}} {{an early}} chorale cantata on a hymn by Luther, Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4, <b>probably</b> <b>in</b> 1707. During his chorale cantata cycle, Bach used a hymn by Luther {{as the basis}} for a cantata on nine occasions. He performed Christ lag in Todes Banden again during that cycle.|$|E

50|$|The {{church has}} two bells, both quite small. The treble bell is very ancient and was <b>probably</b> cast <b>in</b> the 14th century. The tenor bell {{is not so}} old and was <b>probably</b> recast <b>in</b> the 17th century.|$|R

5|$|The third Persian army, {{under the}} command of Otanes and Artaphernes, {{attacked}} Ionia and Aeolia. They re-took Clazomenae and Cyme, <b>probably</b> <b>in</b> 497 BC, but then seem to have been less active in 496 BC and 495 BC, probably {{as a result of the}} calamity in Caria.|$|E
5|$|The {{town was}} later given {{defensive}} walls, <b>probably</b> <b>in</b> the 3rd century. After {{the failure of}} Roman authority {{in the first decade}} of the 5th century, the baths fell into disrepair and were eventually lost as a result of rising water levels and silting.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} known religious {{building on}} the site was in 1020 with {{a reference to a}} small rectangular chapel; however, a building <b>probably</b> existed <b>in</b> the 8th century. The current building, <b>probably</b> started <b>in</b> the 13th century was completed in its current format by 1466.|$|R
5|$|A {{circular}} keep was constructed, <b>probably</b> <b>in</b> the late-12th century, on the castle's motte, {{along with}} two stone gatehouses and towers along the walls. The wooden buildings in the bailey were rebuilt in stone and the construction work spread up onto the inside edges of the ramparts. Some of these houses may have belonged {{to the members of}} the castle-guard, feudal knights who were granted local estates in return for helping to defend the castle.|$|E
5|$|A new keep was built, <b>probably</b> <b>in</b> the 13th century. This {{took the}} form of a {{polygonal}} shell keep, with fourteen triangular buttresses supporting six foot (1.8 m) thick walls. The inner bailey was strengthened with new stone walls, 20 to 30 feet (6 to 9 m) tall on top of the earlier earth banks, the walls and keep being built of flint and rubble. The castle was manned during this period by a castle-guard system, in which lands were given out to local lords in return for their providing knights and soldiers to serve at the castle.|$|E
5|$|Above these ignimbrites {{are found}} {{sedimentary}} rocks of the Esk Pike Sandstone Formation. These were deposited in water, <b>probably</b> <b>in</b> a caldera lake, as the volcanic rocks weathered and were eroded. Structures in these rocks suggest the faults were still active and the caldera was still subsiding. Layers of tuff and lapilli-tuff indicate some ongoing volcanism.|$|E
50|$|The hunting lodge was <b>probably</b> built <b>in</b> 1730 by {{the lords}} of Hallberg from Fußgönheim, who had leased the local hunting grounds from the prince-electors.

5|$|According to The Wall Street Journal {{and diverse}} news sites, the 750 million units sold by Michael Jackson is an {{inflated}} figure that was initially claimed by Raymone Bain (2006), {{who was the}} singer's publicist at that time, without any factual evidence and <b>probably</b> <b>in</b> an effort to promote album sales. From 2006 until present time, several sources such as RIAA, Rolling Stone, and Time have claimed that Michael Jackson has sold 750 million units (or even 1 billion), however, Adrian Strain, a representative from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) has said that this figure is unreal.|$|E
5|$|Administrative systems fell {{within the}} hundreds. The Bath Hundred had various names {{including}} the Hundred of LeBuri. The Bath Foreign Hundred or Forinsecum covered the area {{outside the city}} and was later combined into the Bath Forum Hundred. Wealthy merchants had no status within the hundred courts and formed guilds to gain influence. They built the first guildhall <b>probably</b> <b>in</b> the 13th century. Around 1200 the first mayor was appointed.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the Hyksos and the reunification of Egypt under Ahmose I, the Theban rulers began to {{construct}} elaborate tombs that reflected their newfound power. The tombs of Ahmose and his son Amenhotep I (their exact location remains unknown) were <b>probably</b> <b>in</b> the Seventeenth Dynasty necropolis of Dra' Abu el-Naga'. The first royal tombs in the valley were those of Amenhotep I (although this identification is also disputed), and Thutmose I, whose advisor, Ineni, notes in his tomb that he advised the king to place his tomb in the desolate valley (the identity of this actual tomb is unclear, but it is probably KV20 or KV38).|$|E
