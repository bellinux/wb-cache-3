Successful migration from the peritumoral area to the mediastinum was observed for all three tracers up to 60 min after injection. The interlobar lympho-fatty tissue (station ATS 11) revealed an early and preferential accumulation of all three tracers for all tumours assessed and irrespective of the tumour localisation. However, no preferential accumulation in one or two distinct lymph nodes was observed up to 60 min after injection for all three tracers assessed.

40|$|The {{present study}} aims to {{evaluate}} the accuracy of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping performed by intratumoral injection of blue dye in a large series of patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). 153 consecutive patients {{were enrolled in the}} study. All patients had a preoperative cytological diagnosis of PTC, and none had clinical or ultrasonographic (US) evidence of nodal involvement. At surgery, vital <b>patent</b> V <b>blue</b> dye was injected into the malignant thyroid nodule. Subsequently, total thyroidectomy, central compartment (CC) node dissection, and median inferior jugulocarotid node dissection of laterocervical compartment, ipsilateral to the primary tumour, were performed. The excised thyroid, the blue-positive SLN and blue-negative lymph nodes were sent for frozen section and definitive histophatologic analysis. At surgery, blue-positive SLN were found in 107 / 153 patients (69. 9 %), of whom 36 (33. 6 %) had micrometastasis in SLN; moreover, in 13 of these 36 patients (36. 1 %), other nodes were found to be metastatic. In the remaining 71 / 107 blue-positive SLN patients, both the SLN itself and the other removed nodes were found negative for the presence of metastatic disease. In 4 cases, a normal parathyroid gland and in 3 cases fibro-adipous tissue were blue-stained and mistakenly removed as SLN (7 false positive results). On the other hand, SLN was blue-negative in 46 / 153 patients (30. 1 %), of whom 7 patients (15. 2 %) had micrometastases in blue-negative lymph nodes. On the basis of these data, the blue dye procedure for SLN detection appears inappropriate as a standard of care in PTC due to a relatively high number of false negative and false positive results...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim: Precise {{evaluation}} of lymph node status {{is one of}} the most important factors in determining clinical outcome in treating gastro-intestinal (GI) cancer. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping clearly has become highly feasible and accurate in staging GI cancer. This study aims to investigate the feasibility and accuracy of detection of SLN using methylene blue dye in patients with carcinoma of the esophagus and assess its potential role in determining the rational extent of lymphadenectomy in esophageal cancer surgery. Materials and Methods: Thirty-two patients of esophageal cancer diagnosed on endoscopic biopsy were enrolled in this prospective study. After laparotomy, <b>patent</b> methylene <b>blue</b> was injected into the subserosal layer adjacent to the tumor. SLNs were defined as blue stained nodes within a period of 5 min. Standard radical esophagogastrectomy with lymphadenectomy was performed in all the patients. All the resected nodes were examined postoperatively by routine hematoxylin and eosin stain for elucidating the presence of metastasis, and the negative SLNs were examined further with cytokeratin immunohistochemical staining. Results: SLNs were detected in 26 (81. 25 &#x 0025;) patients out of 32 patients who were studied. The number of SLNs ranged from 1 to 4 with a mean value of 1. 7 per case. The SLNs of esophageal cancer were only found in N 1 area in 21 (80. 77 &#x 0025;) cases, and in N 2 or N 3 area in only 19. 33 &#x 0025;. The overall accuracy of the procedure was 75 &#x 0025; in predicting nodal metastasis. SLN had a sensitivity of 85. 71 &#x 0025; in mid esophageal tumors and 93. 33 &#x 0025; in lower esophageal tumors. The SLN biopsy had sensitivity of 87. 5 &#x 0025; in the case of squamous cell carcinoma and 92. 86 &#x 0025; in the cases of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. The accuracy of the procedure for squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma was 60 &#x 0025; and 76. 47 &#x 0025;, respectively. Conclusion: SLN mapping is an accurate diagnostic procedure for detecting lymph node metastasis in patients with esophageal cancer and may indicate rational extent of lymphadenectomy in these patients. SLN mapping provides "right nodes" to the pathologists for detailed analysis and appropriate staging, thereby helping in individualizing the multi-modal treatment for esophageal cancer...|$|R

The number and type of patent anastomoses achieved and lymph node flaps created and any anatomical differences between porcine and human vessels were noted, in light of evaluating the use of pigs as a training model for microsurgery in living tissue. Multiple lymphatic-venous anastomoses were created at the site of a single incision made at the subinguinal region, running medial and parallel to the saphenous vessels. Ten multiple lymphatic-venous anastomoses were created in total, and all were demonstrated to be patent. Four lymph node flaps were prepared for lymph node transfer.
