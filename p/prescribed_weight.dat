After approval, the horses are then paraded to the post and come under starter’s orders. The starter of the race always tries to arrange a start that is fair for all of the horses and jockeys. At the drop of the tape or flags, the race begins.During the race, the horses must stay on the prescribed track, and, if obstacles are involved, they must jump over each one in the proper order. There must not be interference by horses and jockeys with the other horses and jockeys. At the end of the race, the placing judges note the horses and jockeys order of finish. At this point, the riders and their horses return to the judges’ area and wait for permission to be dismounted, though at this time no one is allowed to touch the rider or tack until he has weighed in. And finally, with no objections, and if the patrol judges report that all went smoothly and the jockeys weigh in with their original start of the race weight, the unofficial race results are declared official.At the Foxfield Races, there are no grandstands; therefore viewers are encouraged to walk up to the straight-away or fences where they are able to see the race up close.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with distributed event-triggered H 1 filtering over sensor networks with communication delays. Firstly, a new distributed event-triggered communication scheme is proposed {{to determine whether or}} not each sensor's current sampled-data should be broadcast and transmitted for filter design. Each sensor node is capable to make its own decision to broadcast and to transmit current sampled-data only when its local measurement output error exceeds a specified threshold. Secondly, under the distributed event-triggered communication scheme, the resultant filtering error system, which includes information of communication delays, is transformed into a system with multiple delays. Sufficient conditions on the existence of desired distributed event-triggered H 1 filters are derived such that the resultant filtering error system is asymptotically stable with <b>prescribed</b> <b>weighting</b> average H 1 performance. The trade-off analysis between communication resource utilization and weighting average H 1 performance is carried out.

However, objective measurements of TEE {{may not always be}} readily available and can be expensive. This study aimed to investigate the validity of RT 3 accelerometers in predicting the TEE of sedentary overweight adults, and to identify any sensitivity to anthropometric changes. Methods: The analysis used data from a 12 -week weight loss study. At baseline and 12 -week, TEE was predicted using RT 3 accelerometers during whole room calorimeter stays. Bias between 2 methods was compared at and between the baseline and 12 -week measurement points. Multiple regression analyses of TEE data were conducted. Results: Predicted and measured values for TEE were not different at baseline (P =. 677) but were significantly different after weight loss (P =. 007). However, the mean bias between methods was small (/d) and was not significantly different between 2 time-points.

40|$|Basin areal {{rainfall}} {{is often}} estimated utilizing gauge data observed at specific locations adjusted {{on the basis}} of <b>prescribed</b> <b>weighting</b> factors for each station. The resultant data have many hydrological and meteorological applications. Several hydrometeorological factors, such as spatial rainfall variability, orographic effects, and synoptic frontal systems can greatly affect gauge-catch efficiency in watersheds that lack sufficient gauge densities. As a result, gauge weightings that are determined by conventional approaches (e. g., arithmetic averages, and the Thiessen polygon) that lack consideration for watershed and rainfall characteristics may introduce unexpected errors in estimated basin rainfall. Our approach is to combine hydrological routings and Tabu search using errors of estimated stream discharges as the objective function to determine gauge-weighting factors. Through hydrological routings, basin and rainfall characteristics are implicitly considered into the estimation of discharges representing an integrated basin response to rainfall forcing. The Lanyang River Basin located in northeastern Taiwan is the domain of interest, where wet- and dryseason rainfalls are mainly attributed to typhoons and the winter monsoon, respectively. Wet-season results show significant orographic effect on gauge weightings due to the large cyclonic circulation interacting with the mountainous topography.

We assess the reliability and robustness of this approach using a portfolio of corporate projects.
