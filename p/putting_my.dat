Hadley Freeman of The Guardian noted that the teen-focused show made many {{cultural}} references due to a [...] "renewed interest in the teen market", adding {{that the use of}} cropped tops, micro-minis, and beaded flip-flops showed a [...] "decidedly West Coast approach to fashion". The episode's cultural references to fashion included Julie Cooper's question to her pre-pubescent daughter, [...] "Do you like my hair this straight or is it too Avril Lavigne?", while another mother complains, [...] "What are you doing <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> daughter in Calvin Klein?

500|$|Lupe Fiasco {{has stated}} on MTV's Rap Fix {{as well as}} in various other media that he is a Muslim, and that Islam [...] "plays a part in my life and {{everything}} I do, to a certain extent... I don't like <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> religion out there, I don't like wearing it like that, because I don't want people to look at me as the poster child for Islam. I'm not. I don't want them to look at my flaws and be like, 'oh, that's the flaws of Islam'." [...] His mixtape series Fahrenheit 1/15 featured a remix of Kanye West's [...] "Jesus Walks" [...] entitled [...] "Muhammad Walks", which went on to become very popular in the Muslim community. He can be heard using Islamic recitals in [...] "Hurt Me Soul", [...] "Little Weapon", [...] "Hi-Definition" [...] as well as the intro and outro tracks to Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor. Most recently, Lupe Fiasco claimed to believe Islam will one day take over the world.|$|E
500|$|Calling {{the show}} a [...] "theatrical {{multimedia}} spectacular", Madonna wanted a huge stage {{with a central}} platform from which {{a flight of stairs}} descended. The central [...] platform was flanked by two lower platforms, which housed the band and the musicians. A large video screen was suspended above the stairs, which descended during the show. Two projectors were situated {{at the front of the}} stage, which projected images of The Pope and President Ronald Reagan during the show. Patrick Leonard, who had produced True Blue, joined as the musical director for the shows. Instead of following every note on the records, Leonard encouraged the musicians to come up with new ideas for the songs. Hence a number of the old songs were rearranged, including introducing a medley of [...] "Dress You Up", [...] "Material Girl" [...] and [...] "Like a Virgin"—which contained a sample from the Four Tops song [...] "I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)". American choreographer Shabba Doo was signed to choreograph the show. 13-year-old Christopher Finch was signed to play the part of the small boy from the [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] video, since Felix Howard, who played the original part, did not get a working license, and hence could not join the tour. Madonna wanted three backup singers, a team of male dancers and a succession of costume changes. She took inputs from her then husband, actor Sean Penn saying, [...] "I really respect Sean's opinion. He has great taste and is a very brilliant man. When I was <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> tour together, it was always in the back of my mind: 'I wonder what Sean will think of this?' He's extremely opinionated and has really high standards, and that sometimes pushed me into making decisions I wouldn't have otherwise made." [...] The title [...] "Who's That Girl Tour" [...] came to Madonna's mind during rehearsals one-day when she looked at a gigantic image of herself, projected on a screen on the stage. She commented, ...|$|E
500|$|Esther is {{introduced}} in press materials as being [...] "an innocent {{in a world}} of assassins, liars and zealots". Havins describes Drummond as [...] "an optimist and the glass is half full person". A promotional video released by Starz provided background information on Esther including her college education—the character introduces herself by stating that she has a BA in Linguistics and a Masters in Cognitive science. Series four writer Jane Espenson enjoyed writing for Esther as she felt the character to be most similar to herself. She notes that when devising Esther's backstory the writer's [...] "ended up just <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> college experience down." [...] Esther's introduction invites parallels that of lead female character Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) in the series' 2006 premiere episode [...] "Everything Changes"; she represents an audience surrogate for new American viewers. Havins refers to Esther as the [...] "tour guide" [...] for new viewers coming to Torchwood for the first time, one who is [...] "digging deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole". Despite similarities to their introduction, Havins comments that Esther as a character has a less action-orientated role than Gwen, being more the [...] "techie" [...] of the team who uses her intellect and technology as her weapons. The actress feels that Esther's desk-bound analyst position is [...] "her safe little world". Head writer and executive producer Russell T Davies described Esther as [...] "a very healing force" [...] in helping the other more outspoken characters gel together as a team because she is [...] "much more able to empathise with people." [...] The character's sister, Sarah Drummond (Candace Brown), recurs throughout Miracle Day, Havins feels that her presence helps [...] "humanise the situation" [...] as including family members helps the audience [...] "understand why people react a certain way." [...] Espenson notes that the first scene between Esther and Sarah was discussed at length at the writer's room—the writers chose to make Esther's choice whether or not to refer her ill sister to social services [...] "as difficult as possible" [...] to heighten the pain felt by the character.|$|E

[...] In that match, [...] at Bristol, Robinson took 2–168 as Hammond stroked 143. [...] "You were only paid if you played and I was never sure of my place.

2500|$|... “It {{was through}} Lord Raneleigh [...] and the painter Frank Miles that I was first {{introduced}} to London society... I went to London and was brought out by my friends. Among the most enthusiastic of these was Mr Frank Miles, the artist. I learned afterwards that he saw me one evening at the theatre, and {{tried in vain to}} discover who I was. He went to his clubs and among his artist friends declaring he had seen a beauty, and he described me to everybody he knew, until one day one of his friends met me and he was duly introduced. Then Mr Miles came and begged me to sit for my portrait. I consented, and when the portrait was finished he sold it to Prince Leopold. From that time I was invited everywhere and made a great deal of by many {{members of the royal family}} and nobility. After Frank Miles I sat for portraits to Millais and Burne-Jones and now Frith is <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> face in one of his great pictures." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite being a shy woman, Sackville-West often {{forced herself}} to {{participate}} in literary readings before book clubs and on the BBC in order to {{feel a sense of}} belonging. Her love of the classical traditions in literature put her out of favor with modernist critics and by the 1940s, she was often dismissed as a dated writer, much to her chagrin. For an example, her epic poem [...] "Solitude", published by the Hogarth Press on 27 October 1938 contains references to the Bible, Saint Brenden, Paracelsus, Ixion, Catullus, Andromeda, the Iliad and a Sabine bride, all of which were quite acceptable in the early 20th century, but were seen as anachronistic by 1938. The narrator of Solitude has an ardent love of the English countryside and though the sex of the narrator is left ambiguous, implied at various points to be a man or a woman, it is made clear the narrator loved intensely a woman who is no longer around and who is deeply missed. At one point, it is suggested that the narrator's vividly expressed horror and disgust at Ixion, the brutal rapist whom the narrator feels was justly punished by Zeus, implies that she is a woman, and her desire at another point in the poem to free Andromeda from her chains to make love suggests that she is a lesbian. The narrator compares the love of nature to the love of books as both cultivate her mind, and thinks of herself as superior to the farmers who merely work the land without the time or the interest for poetry, all of which make it possible for her to have a deeper appreciation of nature. Sackville-West felt a deep sense of loss in signing documents in 1947 relinquishing any claim on Sissinghurst, as part of its transition to the National Trust. She wrote of the signing that it [...] "nearly broke my heart, <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> signature to what I regarded as a betrayal of all the tradition of my ancestors and the house I loved." ...|$|E
