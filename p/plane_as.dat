5|$|A monohedral tiling is a {{tessellation}} {{in which}} all tiles are congruent; it has only one prototile. A particularly interesting type of monohedral tessellation is the spiral monohedral tiling. The first spiral monohedral tiling was discovered by Heinz Voderberg in 1936; the Voderberg tiling has a unit tile that is a nonconvex enneagon. The Hirschhorn tiling, published by Michael D. Hirschhorn and D. C. Hunt in 1985, is a pentagon tiling using irregular pentagons: regular pentagons cannot tile the Euclidean <b>plane</b> <b>as</b> the internal angle of a regular pentagon, , is not a divisor of 2.|$|E
5|$|A {{variant of}} the minimax path problem has also been {{considered}} for sets of points in the Euclidean <b>plane.</b> <b>As</b> in the undirected graph problem, this Euclidean minimax path problem can be solved efficiently by finding a Euclidean minimum spanning tree: every path in the tree is a minimax path. However, the problem becomes more complicated when a path is desired that not only minimizes the hop length but also, among paths with the same hop length, minimizes or approximately minimizes the total length of the path. The solution can be approximated using geometric spanners.|$|E

5|$|Eris's orbit {{is highly}} eccentric, and brings Eris to within 37.9AU of the Sun, a typical {{perihelion}} for scattered objects. This {{is within the}} orbit of Pluto, but still safe from direct interaction with Neptune (29.8–30.4AU). Pluto, on the other hand, like other plutinos, follows a less inclined and less eccentric orbit and, protected by orbital resonance, can cross Neptune's orbit. It is possible that Eris is in a 17:5resonance with Neptune, though further observations {{will be required to}} check that hypothesis. Unlike the eight planets, whose orbits all lie roughly in the same <b>plane</b> <b>as</b> the Earth's, Eris's orbit is highly inclined: It is tilted at an angle of about 44degrees to the ecliptic. In about 800years, Eris will be closer to the Sun than Pluto for some time (see the graph at the right).|$|E
5|$|In Washington, Walter Skinner tells agent Dana Scully {{that the}} FBI's {{investigation}} into her sister's murder {{has been made}} inactive, despite the evidence that had been recovered. Fox Mulder tells Scully about the Piper Maru, which had laid anchor at the same coordinates as another ship believed to have salvaged a UFO; when the Piper Maru came to port in San Diego, her crew was found suffering from radiation burns. Aboard the ship, the agents find traces of the black oil on Gauthier's diving suit. Upon viewing a video of the dive, Scully identifies the sunken <b>plane</b> <b>as</b> a P-51 Mustang. Meanwhile, Gauthier returns home and searches for something. When his wife Joan arrives, the black oil passes itself along to her.|$|E
5|$|In another {{patrol in}} July, U-14 sailed {{on the north}} side of the island of Corfu while headed for Santi Quaranta, Albania. Because the harbor at Corfu was {{occupied}} by the French fleet at the time, U-14 conducted a ruse de guerre by flying the submarine's former national flag, the French tricolor, in order to pass unmolested. Even though U-14s new conning tower made her look unlike any other Brumaire-class boat, one French patrol plane was successfully fooled by the ruse. When U-14s crew first spotted the aircraft, flying towards them from the direction of the sun, there was not enough time to submerge. As the aircraft drew near, its French markings—and its cargo of bombs—became apparent to the crew. With no other course of action possible, U-14s crew waved their hats and handkerchiefs at the <b>plane.</b> <b>As</b> the French pilot passed overhead, he returned the waves, apparently unaware of the U-boat's true nationality. The only success by U-14 on this cruise was the sinking of Marionga Goulandris, a Greek steamer, near Cape Matapan.|$|E

5|$|It is {{probable}} that the planet is composed of hydrogen and helium. The planet orbits on the same <b>plane</b> <b>as</b> Kepler-9b, a second and larger gas giant located in the Kepler-9 system. While observing the planet, the Kepler team noticed that Kepler-9b and c orbited in a 1:2 ratio, where Kepler-9b orbits its star every 19 days and Kepler-9c orbits every 38 days. The gravitational pull that each planet has on the other, known as orbital resonance, keeps the planets in a stable orbit. This phenomenon {{is the first of}} its kind seen outside the Solar System. Every time Kepler-9c completed an orbit during the observation period, its orbital period decreased by about 39 minutes. At some point, however, this trend will reverse and its orbit will increase. The lengths of its orbit will oscillate slightly above and below the 2:1 ratio.|$|E
5|$|On a {{surprise}} visit to Damascus {{to celebrate the}} union on 24 February, Nasser was welcomed by crowds {{in the hundreds of}} thousands. Crown Prince Imam Badr of North Yemen was dispatched to Damascus with proposals to include his country in the new republic. Nasser agreed to establish a loose federal union with Yemen—the United Arab States—in place of total integration. While Nasser was in Syria, King Saud planned to have him assassinated on his return flight to Cairo. On 4 March, Nasser addressed the masses in Damascus and waved before them the Saudi check given to Syrian security chief and, unbeknownst to the Saudis, ardent Nasser supporter Abdel Hamid Sarraj to shoot down Nasser's <b>plane.</b> <b>As</b> a consequence of Saud's plot, he was forced by senior members of the Saudi royal family to informally cede most of his powers to his brother, King Faisal, a major Nasser opponent who advocated pan-Islamic unity over pan-Arabism.|$|E
5|$|Owing to air {{compression}} {{in front of}} the <b>plane</b> <b>as</b> it travelled at supersonic speed, the fuselage heated up and expanded by as much as 300mm (almost 1ft). The most obvious manifestation of this was a gap that opened up on the flight deck between the flight engineer's console and the bulkhead. On some aircraft that conducted a retiring supersonic flight, the flight engineers placed their caps in this expanded gap, wedging the cap when it shrank again. To keep the cabin cool, Concorde used the fuel as a heat sink for the heat from the air conditioning. The same method also cooled the hydraulics. During supersonic flight the surfaces forward from the cockpit became heated, and a visor was used to deflect much of this heat from directly reaching the cockpit.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} duality applies {{as well to}} {{infinite}} graphs embedded in the <b>plane</b> <b>as</b> it does to finite graphs. However, care is needed to avoid topological complications such as points of the plane that are neither part of an open region disjoint from the graph nor part of an edge or vertex of the graph. When all faces are bounded regions surrounded by a cycle of the graph, an infinite planar graph embedding can also {{be viewed as a}} tessellation of the plane, a covering of the plane by closed disks (the tiles of the tessellation) whose interiors (the faces of the embedding) are disjoint open disks. Planar duality gives rise to the notion of a dual tessellation, a tessellation formed by placing a vertex at the center of each tile and connecting the centers of adjacent tiles.|$|E
5|$|The curve-shortening flow {{has also}} been studied for curves in {{three-dimensional}} Euclidean space. The normal vector in this case can be defined (as in the <b>plane)</b> <b>as</b> the derivative of the tangent vector with respect to arc length, normalized to be a unit vector; {{it is one of}} the components of the Frenet–Serret frame. It is not well defined at points of zero curvature, but the product of the curvature and the normal vector remains well defined at those points, allowing the curve-shortening flow to be defined. Curves in space may cross each other or themselves according to this flow, and the flow may lead to singularities in the curves; every singularity is asymptotic to a plane. The curve shortening flow for space curves has been used as a way to define flow past singularities in plane curves.|$|E

5|$|The mass of Gliese 876 d from radial {{velocity}} has one problem, {{it is that}} only a lower limit on the mass can be obtained. This is because the measured mass value also depends on the orbital inclination, which in general is unknown. However, models incorporating the gravitational interactions between the resonant outer planets enables the inclination of the orbits to be determined. This reveals that the outer planets are nearly coplanar with an inclination of around 59° {{with respect to the}} plane of the sky. Assuming that Gliese 876 d orbits in the same <b>plane</b> <b>as</b> the other planets, the true mass of the planet is revealed to be 6.83 times the mass of Earth.|$|E

5|$|The player {{may choose}} to begin flight on a runway or taxiway, or in the air. Aircraft are {{controlled}} via keyboard, joystick, head-mounted display or specialized input devices such as pedals. During flight, several third- and first-person camera angles may be selected.

Certain camera angles, including the Three-Way View and 3-D Cockpit view, provide the player with simulated flight instruments such as an altimeter, airspeed indicator, accelerometer, variometer and tachometer. The game is designed to allow players to perform aerobatic maneuvers such as the Immelmann turn, tailslide, Lomcevak and Cuban Eight. Performances may be recorded and played back, with controls that allow the player to pause, rewind and fast forward. At any time, the player may stop a recording and resume flight from that point.|$|E
