50|$|The second Rubin {{maneuver}} {{is performed}} by inserting one hand vaginally behind the posterior aspect of anterior {{shoulder of the}} foetus and rotating the shoulder towards the chest of the foetus, shifting it from the midline (12 o clock) to 11 o clock or 1 o clock position. As a result, the foetal shoulder girdle is adducted and the diameter is reduced. The second Rubin maneuver is more successful if it is combined with suprapubic pressure to facilitate vaginal rotation. This maneuver is painful and difficult for an unanesthetized mother. For <b>primipara,</b> an episiotomy may be performed before inserting the vaginal hand. The reverse Wood's screw maneuver {{is the same as}} second Rubin maneuver except that it is performed on posterior shoulder and the rotation happens on an oblique plane.|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{influence}} of parity on periparturitional behavior by quantitatively comparing the behavior of 10 primiparous and 11 multiparous cynomolgus macaques. We found {{a considerable number of}} significant differences, some of them affirming the outcome of previous descriptive studies. During the prepartus phase, <b>primiparae</b> showed more locomotion and "action postures" and fewer "resting postures" than multiparae. Further, <b>primiparae</b> spent more time straining than multiparae and were straining in a greater variety of postures than multiparae, which were straining predominantly in a squatting posture. In the postpartus phase, <b>primiparae</b> needed more time than multiparae to get their young in ventroventral position. <b>Primiparae</b> licked mainly the newborn;multiparae licked mainly their own bodies. Finally, fewer <b>primiparae</b> than multiparae ate the placenta. The discussion extensively treats theories concerning parity effects. We explain behavioral differences between <b>primiparae</b> and multiparae in terms of novelty of the female's internal state and novelty of the neonate and in terms of learning. We stress that the mechanism behind the so-called parity effect cannot be revealed without paying more attention, next to learning, to age, to experience with pregnancy, and to experience with parturition. Further, we argue that the immediate acceptance of the newborn at birth and the differences between <b>primiparae</b> and multiparae might {{play a crucial role in}} the search for the mechanism behind the onset of maternal behavior...|$|R
40|$|Abstract <b>Primiparas</b> with {{advanced}} age are predisposed to adverse maternal and neonatal risks. The {{aim of this}} retro-spective cohort study, conducted between January 1 st and December 31 st, 2004 in the maternity of the Yaounde Uni-versity Teaching Hospital, Cameroon, was to identify from what age these adverse risks become significant in Cameroo-nian women. The medical files of 233 <b>primiparae</b> aged 26 and above (case) and that of 404 <b>primiparae</b> aged between 20 and 25 years (control) were reviewed and some data com-pared. Cesarean sections, instrumental deliveries, low Apgar scores at 5 th minute and early neonatal death rates were significantly higher in <b>primiparae</b> aged 27 years and above.

40|$|A {{follow up}} study of 84 {{patients}} with early onset pre-eclampsia (before 37 weeks' gestation) showed a high prevalence of underlying renal disease. Renal abnormalities were found in 33 of the 49 <b>primiparas</b> (67 %) and in 22 of the 35 multiparas (63 %). Two thirds of the multiparas with pre-eclampsia before 37 weeks with a diagnosis of either essential hypertension or renal disease had recurrent pre-eclampsia. Maternal morbidity and fetal mortality were greater in the group with early onset pre-eclampsia than in a group with late onset disease. Idiopathic pre-eclampsia occurred in 10 % of <b>primiparas</b> in the early onset group, whereas it was the main condition in over three quarters of <b>primiparas</b> in the late onset group.

40|$|The {{topic of}} the {{bachelor}} thesis is the informedness of <b>primiparas</b> about a newborn child care. The theoretical part of the thesis explains terms physiological newborn child, his/her postnatal adaptation and basic care of a newborn child. It describes the basic acts that the nurses aim to teach all mothers in hospital, such as changing nappies, bathing, caring of the umbilical scar and handling a newborn child. It also describes the equipment needed for basic care of a child. The practical part of the thesis raised five objectives and five hypotheses. The first objective was to compare the level of informedness of <b>primiparas</b> in two hospitals in the Czech Republic (Oblastní nemocnice Příbram, a. s. and Nemocnice České Budějovice, a. s.). The hypothesis that the informedness of <b>primiparas</b> in Oblastní nemocnice Příbram, a. s. is lower has not been confirmed. The other objectives were to ascertain the level of informedness of <b>primiparas</b> about bathing techniques, treatment of the umbilical scar and handling a new-born child, and the sources from which the <b>primiparas</b> obtain most information. The hypothesis that <b>primiparas</b> have sufficient information about bathing techniques, care of the umbilical scar and the ways how to take a new-born child from the cot and how to hold the child correctly, and the hypothesis that they obtain most information from the nurses in hospital and, when being out of hospital, from the Internet have been confirmed.

40|$|Aims To {{test the}} null {{hypothesis}} that bony pelvis dimensions are similar in women with and without stress urinary incontinence (SUI), both in the postpartum and midlife periods. Methods Secondary analyses were performed of two case–control studies comparing women with SUI to asymptomatic controls. One study examined <b>primiparas</b> in the first 9 – 12 months postpartum; the other study involved middle‐aged women. SUI was confirmed by full‐bladder stress test. All subjects underwent pelvic magnetic resonance imaging. The interspinous and intertuberous diameters, subpubic angle, and sacrococcygeal joint‐to‐the inferior pubic point distance were measured from the images independently by two authors. Results In the young cohorts, we compared <b>primiparas</b> with de novo postpartum SUI to both continent <b>primiparas</b> and nulliparas. Postpartum SUI {{is associated with a}} wider subpubic angle. There is also a trend towards wider interspinous and intertuberous diameters in the stress‐incontinent <b>primiparas</b> as compared to the continent cohorts, although this did not reach statistical significance with our sample sizes. By contrast, no significant differences in bony pelvis dimensions were identified when comparing middle‐aged women with SUI and their continent controls. Conclusions Bony pelvis dimensions are different in women with SUI than in matched continent controls. However, these differences are only identified in young <b>primiparas</b> in the postpartum period, not in middle‐aged women. Neurourol.

40|$|Objective 　To {{analyze the}} {{difference}} of the delivery date reckoned by traditional and modified formula for calculating the {{expected date of confinement}} (EDC). Methods 　The data of 2055 women (37 - 41 + 6 week) were collected who gave monotocousa term spontaneous birth in the Chongqing Health Center for Women and Children from Jan. 2014 to Feb. 2015. Of which 1300 were <b>primipara,</b> and 755 were multipara; and the data of 1224 women (39 - 41 week) were collected, of which 832 were <b>primipara,</b> and 392 were multipara. The expected date was calculated with traditional and modified calculating formula, and then the actual delivery date was used for comparison and statistical analysis. Results 　The coincidence of actual delivery date with the estimated due date reckoned by traditional formula (39 - 41 week) was 8. 4 % in <b>primipara</b> and 9. 7 % in multipara, and the coincidence reckoned by modified formula was 11. 9 % in <b>primipara</b> and 14. 8 % in multipara. The EDC estimated by modified formula was more precise than that calculated by traditional formula (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Female mammals invest {{heavily in}} reproduction. Females require food to {{reproduce}} and thus mothers compete for food. In group-living species, females who form strong intrasexual social bonds reproduce more than females who do not. To reproduce successfully, females must meet both nutritional and social needs. Although mothers face certain challenges involving competition and affiliation, not all mothers are the same. One factor, parity, affects females across taxa. Due to inexperience, <b>primiparas,</b> mothers raising their first offspring, face challenges not experienced by multiparas, mothers with multiple offspring. Therefore, <b>primiparas</b> behave differently than multiparas. Chimpanzees {{are an excellent}} species to investigate whether behavior varies with parity. Chimpanzees are long-lived and <b>primiparas</b> live with multiparas in multi-female, multi-male, fission-fusion communities. I investigated the relationship between parity and behavior by conducting a 15 -month study of female chimpanzees living in the community at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda. During the study, several females gave birth to their first offspring. This produced an ideal situation to compare the behavior of mothers who differed in parity, testing the prediction that <b>primiparas</b> and multiparas behave differently. To determine how females compete with one another, I examined ranging and intrasexual aggression, which influence food access. To examine female social bonds, I analyzed observations of association and grooming. Females at Ngogo utilized small, overlapping ranges within the community territory. Range sizes differed, but parity did not predict this variation. As reported elsewhere, mothers were often aggressive toward adolescent nulliparas. Female aggression varied with parity; <b>primiparas</b> displayed more aggression toward adolescents than did multiparas. Regarding affiliation, mothers mainly associated and groomed with mothers, rather than with adolescent nulliparas. Examining mothers by parity class showed that <b>primiparas</b> groomed with adolescent nulliparas more than did multiparas. These results indicate that behavioral differences existed between primiparous and multiparous female chimpanzees. These differences involved mothers’ social interactions with adolescent nulliparas in competitive and affiliative contexts. These results {{emphasize the importance of}} examining parity because considering mothers as a single category can mask behavioral variation. This indicates the importance of examining the lives of <b>primiparas</b> in order to understand how evolution has influenced the mothers’ behavior...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{practice}} of cesarean section {{is known to}} decrease the occurrence of long bone fractures. We present here an unusual diaphyseal fracture of the femur of a newborn after cesarean section, the only case observed in our 14 years of practice. Case Report: The patient was a 3. 4 -kg female child born at 38 weeks of gestation. The mother was a <b>primipara</b> and aged 39 years. Ultrasound examination at 20 th week revealed intrauterine fibroids with a breech presentation. Therefore, elective cesarean section was indicated. There was no apparent bone disorder that could predispose to sustain femur fracture. The fracture was treated successfully with a bilateral spica cast. The cesarean section was indicated in an aged <b>primipara,</b> bearer of uterine fibroids, and breech presentation. She had a good general health status, but her bone density was unknown since this examination is not routinely performed in our clinical settings in Africa. Conclusion: Elderly age, <b>primipara</b> status, presence of uterine fibroids, and breech presentation are usual indications for cesarean section. However, {{there are not many}} reports on femur fracture after cesarean section. Our present case suggests that despite the latest advances in delivery techniques, cesarean section for breech presentation predisposes the neonate to femoral fractures.

40|$|Background: First time {{mothers in}} {{particular}} may feel anxious {{about how they}} are going to cope with looking after themselves and their newborn. Most Indian women believe that they have little or no control over their pregnancies or outcomes. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of a Structured Physical Activity and Health Care Education program on the psychological well-being for <b>Primipara</b> mothers in postpartum period. Methods: This study was a Randomized Controlled Trail. <b>Primipara</b> mothers who were ready for discharge from The Narayana Medical College & General Hospital in postnatal ward were eligible for this study. Forty one (41) <b>Primipara</b> mothers randomized onto the trail. The experimental group(n= 20) received an 4 week “Structured Physical Activity” (SPA) program, including Structured Physical Activity provided by a team of health care professionals combined with parenting education & counseling. The other group (n= 21) Health Care Education Only (HCEO) received only the same educational material as the experimental group. In pre and post schedule outcome measures of both SPA&HCEO groups were assessed with Psychological well-being (Positive Affect Balance Scale), Depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale), and Physical activity were assessed at baseline, 4 th week and then 8 th week later. Results: The improvement was significantly high in well-being scores, depressive symptoms and physical activity of the (SPA) group compared with the (HCEO) group over the study period and this effect was maintained 8 weeks after completion of the program.

Eligible participants will be randomly allocated to either a control group (receiving routine care) or an experimental group (receiving a postnatal psychoeducation programme besides routine care). Outcome measures include maternal parental self-efficacy, social support and postnatal depression. Data will be collected at baseline (on the day of discharge), 6 and 12 weeks postpartum. Discussion: This will be the first study of its kind that will use rigorous study design to evaluate a theory-based innovative postnatal psychoeducation programme on maternal outcomes. The study may identify a potentially effective way of enhancing primiparas' self-efficacy and social support, which may in turn reduce their risk of postnatal depression. The Sigma Theta Tau International Upsilon Eta Chapter funded this study...|$|R
40|$|Background: In University Clinical Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology {{is using}} {{reference}} data from 1974 {{developed for the}} infants born in Belgrade (Serbia). It estimates the standards of term infants for neonatal weight, length and head circumference. Aim: This study was create to develop charts for birth weight, lenght and head circumference specific to gestational age, gender and parity for term singleton infants in Tuzla Canton. Methods: The study was conducted at University Clinical Center Tuzla, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, a primary obstetrical care facility for residents of Tuzla Canton over the one-year period. During the one year study period, 01. 01. - 31. 12. 2009, there were 4106 infants born at 37 th to 41 th weeks of gestation (GW), 2168 (52. 8 %) males and 1938 (47. 2 %) females. We analysed gestational age, birth weights, body length and head circumference. Results: Females infants of <b>primiparae,</b> born at 40 th gestational week, had the lowest median birth weight, 3500 g, followed by female infants of multiparae, 3640 g, and male infants of <b>primiparae,</b> 3650 g. The greatest median birth weight, 3730 g, had male infants of multiparae. Median birth length value at the 40 th gestational week for male infants of <b>primiparae</b> and multiparae, as well as female infants of multiparae is the same, 55 cm, while is lower in female infants of <b>primiparae</b> (54 cm). There is no difference in median head circumference at the 40 th gestational week between female infants of <b>primiparae</b> and multiparae, and male infants of <b>primiparae</b> (35 cm). Mean birth weight and length of liveborn infants at 37. to 41. gestational week differed significantly between certain parities (F= 8, 723, Df= 2, p&lt; 0, 001; F= 3, 292, Df= 2, p= 0, 037, respectively). No {{significant difference was found}} for head circumference (F= 0, 983, Df= 2, p= 0, 374). Conclusion: The average birth weight of infants within Tuzla Canton is bigger in comparison with the centile that have been used so far...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare levels of {{postpartum}} fatigue, depression, childcare stress, and maternal identity according to postpartum period between <b>primiparas</b> who used Sanhujori facilities and those who did not. Methods: The research design was a longitudinal descriptive study using self-report questionnaires. Participants were 55 healthy <b>primiparas</b> who delivered at one of 3 hospitals in Chungnam, 21 using Sanhujori facilities and 34 not using these facilities during the first three weeks after childbirth. Data were collected from October 2008 to April 2009 at three measure-ment points, 2 - 4 days after childbirth (T 1), 4 - 6 weeks (T 2), and 12 - 14 weeks (T 3). Data were analyzed using the SPSS 17. 0 WIN program. Results: There was a significant difference in childcare stress between the two groups at 4 - 6 weeks after childbirth. Postpartum depression and childcare stress at 4 - 6 weeks were significantly higher than those of the other postpartum periods, while maternal identity was significantly lower. Conclusion: Child care stress is the most important issue among women who use Sanhujori facilities and the 4 - 6 week period after childbirth is very difficult to <b>primiparas.</b> These results indicate that nursing interventions for <b>primiparas</b> in Sanhujori facilities should focus on reducing childcare stress...|$|R
