50|$|Pentyl pentanoate (C4H9COOC5H11) is an ester used in dilute {{solution}} {{to replicate the}} scent or flavour of apple, and sometimes pineapple. It {{is referred to as}} <b>pentyl</b> <b>valerate</b> or amyl pentanoate using classical nomenclature. it can be used for a variety of chemical uses, such as in the production of flavoured products, like sweets.|$|E
50|$|Valeric acid, or pentanoic acid, is a {{straight-chain}} alkyl {{carboxylic acid}} with the chemical formula C5H10O2. Like other low-molecular-weight carboxylic acids, {{it has a}} very unpleasant odor. It is found naturally in the perennial flowering plant valerian (Valeriana officinalis), from which it gets its name. Its primary use is in the synthesis of its esters. Volatile esters of valeric acid tend to have pleasant odors and are used in perfumes and cosmetics. Ethyl valerate and <b>pentyl</b> <b>valerate</b> are used as food additives because of their fruity flavors.|$|E
40|$|International audienceEthanol {{production}} {{is generally considered}} as the main option for converting lignocellulose to biofuels. However another route can produce valeric esters from lignocellulose through levulinic acid. While {{the process has been}} well characterized, only few experimental results describe their combustion behavior. Using two engine test benches, compression ignition (CI) and spark ignition (SI), we have investigated the engine performances and emissions of methyl, ethyl, butyl and <b>pentyl</b> <b>valerate.</b> According to their physicochemical properties, pure and blends of 20 %vol methyl or ethyl ester with PRF 95 were tested in the SI engine, while blends of 20 %vol butyl or pentyl esters with gasoil were tested in the CI engine. In the SI experiments, we observed that the methyl and ethyl valerate have a higher flame speed than PRF 95 which required a slight change of ignition timing to optimize the work output. However, both the performances and the emissions are not significantly modified. In the CI experiments, the blends including butyl or <b>pentyl</b> <b>valerate</b> performed equally well as the diesel. The lower cetane number of the esters slightly increase the ignition delay of the blends without affecting the performances. According to the results of this study, valeric biofuels represent very good alternative biofuels for both SI and CI engines...|$|E
40|$|<b>Pentyl</b> <b>valerate</b> was {{synthesized}} biocatalytically using Candida rugosa lipase (CRL) immobilized in microemulsion based organogels (MBGs). The optimum {{conditions were}} found to be pH 7. 0, temperature of 37 °C, ratio of concentration of water to surfactant (Wo) of 60, and the surfactant sodium bis- 2 -(ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT) for MBG preparation. Although kinetic studies revealed that the enzyme in free form had high affinity towards substrates (Km = 23. 2 [*]mM for pentanol and 76. 92 [*]mM for valeric acid) whereas, after immobilization, the Km values increased considerably (74. 07 [*]mM for pentanol and 83. 3 [*]mM for valeric acid) resulting in a slower reaction rate, the maximum conversion was much higher in case of immobilized enzyme (~ 99 %) as compared to free enzyme (~ 19 %). Simultaneous effects of important parameters were studied using response surface methodology (RSM) conjugated with Box-Behnken design (BBD) with five variables (process parameters), namely, enzyme concentration, initial water content (Wo), solvent used for MBG preparation, substrate ratio and time, and response as the final product formation, that is, <b>pentyl</b> <b>valerate</b> (%). The MBGs were reused for 10 consecutive cycles for ester synthesis. Efficacy of AOT/isooctane as dehydrating agent for extracting excess water from MBGs was found to exert a positive effect on the esterification reaction...|$|E
