40|$|Introduction: Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s {{disease is}} a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disease involving the basal ganglia affecting dopamine-secreting nigrostriatal pathway. It is diagnosed clinically {{by the presence of}} any combination of: Bradykinesia, Resting Tremor, Rigidity, Gait instability. Psychosis occurs in 20 to 40 percent of drug-treated patients with PD, and visual hallucinations are the most common psychotic symptom. Parkinsonian Psychosis treatment (with neuroleptics/antipsychotics blocking Dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway) had been a clinical challenge because it risks exacerbation of motor symptomatology. On 4 / 29 / 16, FDA approved <b>Pimavanserin,</b> a 5 HT- 2 A inverse agonist, a novel antipsychotic, that addresses psychosis independently of the Dopamine pathways after successful completion of a phase 3 placebo-controlled trial. We report a case of Parkinsonian psychosis which responded well to <b>Pimavanserin.</b> Case Report 72 year old Caucasian female with a history of Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s; motor symptoms previously stable on Carbidopa-Levodopa (Sinemet) but developing visual hallucinations secondary to Sinemet and consequently being weaned off of it by outpatient neurologist in anticipation of being initiated on <b>Pimavanserin.</b> Admitted for acute agitation, mild paranoia and worsening visual hallucinations (VH) with dementia ongoing for the past year. During her inpatient stay, she was completely weaned off of Sinemet and was started on <b>Pimavanserin</b> 17 mg bid (well-tolerated). Target psychosis symptoms (paranoia and visual hallucinations) resolved secondary to 3 days of <b>Pimavanserin</b> at starting dose and motor symptoms did not deteriorate after 3 days of not being on any Sinemet and she was discharged. Discussion Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s Disease psychosis is the strongest predictor of nursing home placement as well as mortality. The psychosis is hypothesized to represent an imbalance between the dopamine and serotonin systems. Treatment in the past was more difficult secondary to limited pharmacological options. interestingly, Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease was treated primarily with dopaminergic agents to reduce motor symptoms but these agents often worsened the psychosis. Similarly, Psychosis was treated primarily with antipsychotic agents, which in turn, worsened the motor symptoms. <b>Pimavanserin,</b> a selective serotonin 5 HT 2 A inverse agonist, has potent actions on 5 HT 2 A without any dopaminergic activity/affinity. Conclusion: Due to these actions, <b>Pimavanserin</b> was able to significantly reduce psychotic symptoms in patients with moderate to severe Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease, achieve efficacy without worsening motor symptoms, achieve efficacy without significant safety concerns in our patient. Our patient tolerated this medication well, showed clinically meaningful improvement in psychotic symptoms, and reduced the caregiver burden on his family...|$|E
40|$|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder with prominent motor and non-motor symptoms. Psychosis develops in over 40 % of PD patients {{and it is}} one of the most distressing symptoms for patients and caregivers alike.

40|$|Brianna L Combs, Arthur G Cox Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sullivan University College of Pharmacy, Louisville, KY, USA Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) has a {{prevalence}} of nearly 1 {{million people in}} the USA, with increasing incidence in the elderly population. Generally, the age of presentation is between 55 and 65  years, with the likelihood of diagnosis increasing as patients reach the age of 80  years or above. Some of the common treatments for PD increase dopamine levels in the brain. Dopaminergic therapy helps to improve motor and non-motor symptoms, but it is not without risks. Dopaminergic therapy can cause confusion, delirium, and psychotic-like behavior. It is recommended that these agents are used cautiously in patients with a history of psychosis due to the risk of exacerbation. It is unclear whether Parkinson’s disease psychosis (PDP) is due to the disease itself, the treatment, or a combination of both, {{but it is clear that}} a safe, effective treatment is necessary. Second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics are the current choice of therapy for PDP. All of these agents have a black box warning from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for elevated risk of mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. <b>Pimavanserin</b> (Nuplazid®) received its novel drug approval by the FDA on April 29, 2016, to treat hallucinations and delusions associated with psychosis experienced by some people with PD.

40|$|Serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine, or 5 -HT) receptors mediate {{a plethora}} of {{physiological}} phenomena {{in the brain and}} the periphery. Additionally, serotonergic dysfunction has been implicated in nearly every neuropsychiatric disorder. The effects of serotonin are mediated by fourteen GPCRs. Both the therapeutic actions and side effects of commonly prescribed drugs are frequently due to nonspecific actions on various 5 -HT receptor subtypes. For more than 20 years, the search for clinically efficacious drugs that selectively target 5 -HT receptor subtypes has been only occasionally successful. This review provides an overview of 5 -HT receptor pharmacology and discusses two recent 5 -HT receptor subtype–selective drugs, lorcaserin and <b>pimavanserin,</b> which target the 5 HT 2 C and 5 HT 2 A receptors and provide new treatments for obesity and Parkinson’s disease psychosis, respectively.

40|$|Psychotic {{symptoms}} {{are present in}} up to 50 % of patients with Parkinson’s disease. These symptoms have detrimental effects on patients’ and caregivers’ {{quality of life and}} may predict mortality. The pathogenesis of psychotic symptoms in Parkinson’s disease is complex, but the use of dopaminergic medications is one of the risk factors. The treatment of psychotic symptoms in Parkinson’s disease is complicated due to the ability of antipsychotic medications to worsen motor symptoms. The efficacy of clozapine in the treatment of psychosis in patients with Parkinson’s disease has been confirmed in several clinical trials; however, the adverse effects and the necessity of blood count monitoring are the reasons why the use of this drug is challenging. The studies on safety and efficacy of other antipsychotics conflicting results. The use of antipsychotics in these patients is also associated with increased mortality. Psychotic symptoms in Parkinson’s disease per se are also proven predictors of mortality. Thus it is necessary to treat psychotic symptoms but the choice of an antipsychotic should be based on careful risk/benefit assessment. <b>Pimavanserin</b> as a novel therapeutic option with more favorable adverse effects profile is now available for this indication, but careful postmarketing monitoring is necessary to establish the true picture of this drug’s long-term safety and efficacy...|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) show varying degrees of basal or {{constitutive}} activity. This constitutive activity is usually minimal in natural receptors but is markedly observed in wild type and mutated (naturally or induced) receptors. According to conventional two-state drug receptor interaction model, binding of a ligand may initiate activity (agonist {{with varying degrees of}} positive intrinsic activity) or prevent the effect of an agonist (antagonist with zero intrinsic activity). Inverse agonists bind with the constitutively active receptors, stabilize them, and thus reduce the activity (negative intrinsic activity). Receptors of many classes (α-and β-adrenergic, histaminergic, GABAergic, serotoninergic, opiate, and angiotensin receptors) have shown basal activity in suitable in vitro models. Several drugs that have been conventionally classified as antagonists (β-blockers, antihistaminics) have shown inverse agonist effects on corresponding constitutively active receptors. Nearly all H 1 and H 2 antihistaminics (antagonists) {{have been shown to be}} inverse agonists. Among the β-blockers, carvedilol and bucindolol demonstrate low level of inverse agonism as compared to propranolol and nadolol. Several antipsychotic drugs (D 2 receptors antagonist), antihypertensive (AT 1 receptor antagonists), antiserotoninergic drugs and opioid antagonists have significant inverse agonistic activity that contributes partly or wholly to their therapeutic value. Inverse agonism may also help explain the underlying mechanism of beneficial effects of carvedilol in congestive failure, naloxone-induced withdrawal syndrome in opioid dependence, clozapine in psychosis, and candesartan in cardiac hypertrophy. Understanding inverse agonisms has paved a way for newer drug development. It is now possible to develop agents, which have only desired therapeutic value and are devoid of unwanted adverse effect. <b>Pimavanserin</b> (ACP- 103), a highly selective 5 -HT 2 A inverse agonist, attenuates psychosis in patients with Parkinson's disease with psychosis and is devoid of extrapyramidal side effects. This dissociation is also evident from the development of anxioselective benzodiazepines devoid of habit-forming potential. Hemopressin is a peptide ligand that acts as an antagonist as well as inverse agonist. This agent acts as an antinociceptive agent in different in vivo models of pain. Treatment of obesity by drugs having inverse agonist activity at CB 1 / 2 receptors is also underway. An exciting development is evaluation of β-blockers in chronic bronchial asthma—a condition akin to congestive heart failure where β-blockade has become the standard mode of therapy. Synthesis and evaluation of selective agents is underway. Therefore, inverse agonism is an important aspect of drug–receptor interaction and has immense untapped therapeutic potential...|$|E

Improvement in psychopathology was measured by the PANSS and CGI-S. The reduction in PANSS Total Score with RIS 2 PIM at endpoint was significantly greater than RIS 2 PBO: − 23. 0 vs. − 16. 3 (p= 0. 007), and not significantly different from the RIS 6 PBO group: − 23. 2 points. The percentage of patients with ≥ 20 % improvement at day 15 in the RIS 2 PIM group was 62. 3 %, significantly greater than the RIS 6 PBO (42. 1 %; p= 0. 01) and the RIS 2 PBO groups (37. 7 %; p= 0. 002).
