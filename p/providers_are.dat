The host provider shall present the information demanded by PTC and take the precautions instructed by the PTC.

5|$|The {{landline}} telephones in most residential {{homes are}} analog—that is, the speaker's voice directly determines the signal's voltage. Although short-distance calls may be handled from end-to-end as analog signals, increasingly telephone service <b>providers</b> <b>are</b> transparently converting the signals to digital signals for transmission. The {{advantage of this}} is that digitized voice data can travel side-by-side with data from the Internet and can be perfectly reproduced in long distance communication (as opposed to analog signals that are inevitably impacted by noise).|$|E

5|$|Many Western Catholics have voiced {{significant}} {{disagreement with}} the Church's teaching on contraception. Catholics for Choice, a political lobbyist group which is not associated with the Catholic Church, stated in 1998 that 96% of U.S. Catholic women had used contraceptives {{at some point in}} their lives and that 72% of Catholics believed that one could be a good Catholic without obeying the Church's teaching on birth control. Use of natural family planning methods among United States Catholics purportedly is low, although the number cannot be known with certainty. As Catholic health <b>providers</b> <b>are</b> among the largest providers of services to patients with HIV/AIDS worldwide, there is significant controversy within and outside the church regarding the use of condoms as a means of limiting new infections, as condom use ordinarily constitutes prohibited contraceptive use.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, Malawi's Ministry of Health and Population began {{developing}} {{a plan to}} distribute antiretroviral drugs to the population, and, as of 2003, there were several sites providing antiretroviral drugs in Malawi. The Lighthouse, a trust in Lilongwe that fights HIV/AIDS, provides antiretroviral drugs {{at a cost of}} 2,500 kwacha per month. Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre provides antiretroviral therapy through its outpatient department, and Médecins Sans Frontières distributes antiretroviral drugs to patients for free in the Chiradzulu and Thyolo Districts. Many different private providers sell antiretroviral drugs, particularly in cities; however, very few patients can afford to receive drugs from the private sector in Malawi. In addition, private <b>providers</b> <b>are</b> not currently required to obtain certification before selling antiretroviral drugs, and, therefore, this practice is not closely monitored. Finally, some employees receive access to antiretroviral drugs through the health insurance policies provided by their employers, but this practice is not widespread.|$|E
5|$|Utility <b>providers</b> <b>are</b> {{regulated}} monopolies: Xcel Energy supplies electricity, CenterPoint Energy supplies gas, CenturyLink provides landline telephone service, and Comcast provides cable service. In 2007 citywide {{wireless internet}} coverage began, provided for 10 years by US Internet of Minnetonka to residents for about $20 per month and to businesses for $30. The Minneapolis Wi-Fi network earns $1.2 million annual profit {{and as of}} 2010 has about 20,000 customers. The city treats and distributes water and requires payment of a monthly solid waste fee for trash removal, recycling, and drop off for large items. Residents who recycle receive a credit.

Ordinances govern parking on the plowing routes during these emergencies as well as snow shoveling throughout the city.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, an {{exclusive}} <b>provider</b> organization <b>is</b> a hybrid {{health insurance plan}} in which a primary care <b>provider</b> <b>is</b> not necessary, but in which health care <b>providers</b> must <b>be</b> seen within a predetermined network. Out of network care is not provided, and visits require pre-authorization. Doctors are paid {{as a function of}} care provided, as opposed to an HMO. In an EPO, the payment scheme is usually fee for service, in contrast to HMOs. In the latter, the healthcare <b>provider</b> <b>is</b> paid by capitation, and receives a monthly fee {{regardless of whether or not}} the patient is seen.|$|R
5000|$|The crucial {{difference}} {{is that in the}} OpenID authentication use case, the response from the identity <b>provider</b> <b>is</b> an assertion of identity; while in the OAuth authorization use case, the identity <b>provider</b> <b>is</b> also an API provider, and the response from the identity <b>provider</b> <b>is</b> an access token that may grant the application ongoing access to some of the identity provider's APIs, on the user's behalf. The access token acts as a kind of [...] "valet key" [...] that the application can include with its requests to the identity provider, which prove that it has permission from the user to access those APIs.|$|R
