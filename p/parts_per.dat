5|$|Leggetts Creek has {{relatively}} {{high levels of}} total dissolved solids and electrical conductivity. The electrical conductivity of the creek ranged from 538.00 to 979.50 micro-siemens per centimeter, {{with an average of}} 677.54 micro-siemens per centimeter. The concentration of dissolved solids ranged from 50.00 to 680.00 milligrams per liter, with an average of 411.96 milligrams per liter. The creek is fairly alkaline, with a pH ranging from 7.64 to 9.23 and averaging 8.20. The concentration of salinity in the creek averages 345 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> million, but reaches levels as high as 435 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> million and as low as 280 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> million. This is within the recommended limit of 1000 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> million, but a 2013/2014 study nevertheless recommended reducing the salinity of the creek.|$|E
5|$|The {{element is}} never {{found in nature}} in pure form, but it is found in small {{quantities}} in minerals with other rare earths. Thulium is often found with minerals containing yttrium and gadolinium. In particular, thulium occurs in the mineral gadolinite. However, thulium also occurs in the minerals monazite, xenotime, and euxenite. Its abundance in the Earth's crust is 0.5mg/kg by weight and 50 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> billion by moles. Thulium makes up approximately 0.5 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> million of soil, although this value can range from 0.4 to 0.8 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> million. Thulium makes up 250 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> quadrillion of seawater. In the solar system, thulium exists in concentrations of 200 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> trillion by weight and 1part per trillion by moles. Thulium ore occurs most commonly in China. However, Australia, Brazil, Greenland, India, Tanzania, and the United States also have large reserves of thulium. Total reserves of thulium are approximately 100,000 tonnes. Thulium is the least abundant lanthanide on earth except for promethium.|$|E

5|$|Uranium's average {{concentration}} in the Earth's crust is (depending on the reference) 2 to 4 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> million, or about 40 times as abundant as silver. The Earth's crust from the surface to 25km (15mi) down is calculated to contain 1017kg (2lb) of uranium while the oceans may contain 1013kg (2lb). The concentration of uranium in soil ranges from 0.7 to 11 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> million (up to 15 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> million in farmland soil due to use of phosphate fertilizers), and its {{concentration in}} sea water is 3 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> billion.|$|E

5|$|Protactinium (formerly protoactinium) is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Pa and atomic number 91. It is a dense, silvery-gray metal which readily reacts with oxygen, water vapor and inorganic acids.
