50|$|For some tissues like cartilage, highly dense {{polymeric}} scaffolds such as {{polyethylene glycol}} (PEG) are essential due to mechanical stress {{and that can}} be achieved by combining them with natural biodegradable cell-adhesive scaffolds since cells can not attach to synthetic polymers and take proper signals for normal cell function. Various scaffold combinations with PEG-based hydrogels are studied to assess the chondrogenic response to dynamic strain stimulation in a recent study. PEG-Proteoglycan, PEG-Fibrinogen, PEG-Albumin conjugates and only PEG including hydrogels are used to evaluate the mechanical effect on bovine chondrocytes by using a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>reactor</b> system. The most substantial increase in stiffness is observed in PEG-Fibrinogen conjugated hydrogel after 28 days of mechanical stimulation.|$|E

40|$|The main {{operational}} {{characteristics of a}} novel gasifier operating in the CFB mode are outlined in this paper, based on the experimental results from a total of 11 runs in the pyrolysis mode. The operation runs constituted the main experiments in the CFB reactor, carried out to derive meaningful mass balance and additional operational data for the CFB pyrolyzer. The experiments were conducted in varying operating conditions determined by the most important parameters, i. e., biomass flowrate, fluidizing gas flowrate, air factor, initial bed inventory), temperature in the CFB riser, vapor residence time and nominal air factor - or equivalence ratio, Sb. The results obtained showed that the reactor configuration successfully operated as a biomass fast pyrolysis system to maximize liquid yields reaching 61. 50 wt% on a maf biomass basis, with the novel feature of providing for autothermal operation at 500 °C and with 0. 46 s gas-vapor residence time, by utilizing the by-product char energy content in a single reactor. The reactor provides a very high specific throughput of 1. 12 - 1. 48 kg/h m 2 and the lowest gas-to-feed ratio of 1. 3 - 1. 9 kg gas/kg feed compared to other fast pyrolysis processes based on <b>pneumatic</b> <b>reactors</b> and has a good scale-up potential, providing significant capital cost reduction. Results to date suggest that the process {{is limited by the}} extent of char combustion. Future work should address resizing of the char combustor to increase overall system capacity, improve the solid separation and substantially increase liquid recovery...|$|R
40|$|Gas-lift {{reactors}} are {{the simplest}} <b>pneumatic</b> <b>reactors.</b> Gas {{put into the}} reactor in lower part imparts flow of bubbles producing continuous circulating flow of liquid (or liquid-solid). Gas itself is leaving reactor through upper part of it passing gas separator zone. Three principal types of gas-lift reactors are known: bubble column (BC), internal-loop airlift (IALR) and external-loop airlift (EALR). If in first case reactor (BC) is just vertical vessel (mainly cylindrical one), both air lifts have a riser with co-current upflow gas and liquid and a downcomer with downflow of liquid phase with entrapped bubbles moving up in relation to liquid. That means that gas is put into the riser through a sparger (gas distributor device). Amount of gas retained in reactor defines in large extent intensity of transfer phenomena in reactor - hydraulics, mass transfer, heat transfer. Its value is expressed by gas hold-up that is main parameter of gas-lift reactor performance. Basically, gas hold-up is function of flow rate of gas put into the reactor and of flow rate of gas going out from the reactor. The last one in turn depends considerably on type and dimensions of reactor, properties of gas and liquid phase. The most of authors studied gas hold-up in all reactor types at room pressure. And almost no data {{can be found on}} performance of air-lift reactors at high pressures that is important for processes with solid catalysts in gas-liquid medium. (orig.)

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to design, construct, test and operate a novel circulating fluid bed fast pyrolysis reactor system for production of liquids from biomass. The novelty lies in incorporating an integral char combustor to provide autothermal operation. A reactor design methodology was devised which correlated input parameters to process variables, namely temperature, heat transfer and gas/vapour residence time, for both the char combustor and biomass pyrolyser. From this methodology a CFB reactor was designed with integral char combustion for 10 kg/h biomass throughput. A full-scale cold model of the CFB unit was constructed and tested to derive suitable hydrodynamic relationships and performance constraints. Early difficulties encountered with poor solids circulation and inefficient product recovery were overcome {{by a series of}} modifications. A total of 11 runs in a pyrolysis mode were carried out with a maximum total liquids yield of 61. 50 % wt on a maf biomass basis, obtained at 500 °C and with 0. 46 s gas/vapour residence time. This could be improved by improved vapour recovery by direct quenching up to an anticipated 75 % wt on a moisture-and-ash-free biomass basis. The reactor provides a very high specific throughput of 1. 12 - 1. 48 kg/hm 2 and the lowest gas-to-feed ratio of 1. 3 - 1. 9 kg gas/kg feed compared to other fast pyrolysis processes based on <b>pneumatic</b> <b>reactors</b> and has a good scale-up potential. These features should provide significant capital cost reduction. Results to date suggest that the process is limited by the extent of char combustion. Future work will address resizing of the char combustor to increase overall system capacity, improvement in solid separation and substantially better liquid recovery. Extended testing will provide better evaluation of steady state operation and provide data for process simulation and reactor modeling...|$|R

40|$|Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) {{has been}} {{developing}} pellet injection systems for plasma fueling experiments on magnetic fusion confinement devices for about 20 years. Recently, the development has focused on meeting the complex fueling needs of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) and future reactors. The proposed ITER fueling system will {{use a combination of}} deuterium- tritium (D-T) gas puffing and pellet injection to achieve and maintain ignited plasmas. The pellet injection system will have to provide D-T fueling for much longer pulse lengths (up to {approx} 1000 s) than present day applications (typically limited to less than several seconds). In this paper, we describe the ongoing pellet injector development activities at ORNL, including the following three in direct support of ITER: (1) an improved pellet feed system for the centrifuge injector, (2) a steady-state extruder feed system, and (3) tritium extruder technology. In addition to the major activities, a repeating two-stage light gas gun for high-speed pellet injection ({approx} 2. 5 km/s) has been developed in a collaboration with ENEA Frascati; also, the production of impurity pellets (Ne, Ar, and Kr) has been demonstrated using the DIII-D and Tokamak Fusion Test <b>Reactor</b> <b>pneumatic</b> pellet injection system...|$|R

The model solution we used for estimation of effects of particle size, gas velocity in pneumatic transport column, height of FB, orifice(s) cross sectional area and PT-column parameters (diameter and height) on mass flux of solids. We tried to estimate by the models theoretical influence of temperature on solids flow and circulation. Considering simplified equations for estimation of pressure drop in the cyclone/impactor and for gas penetration from FB to the PT-column we tentatively evaluated their possible effects on circulation of solids. Comparison of a theoretical forecast for saturation carrying capacity of gas in pneumatic transport (“choking”), computed by selected Yang correlation, with the model-computed mass fluxes of solids has indicated possible problems and instabilities of solids flow in some regimes and arrangements, especially with larger orifices, higher height of FB and/or lower gas velocities in PT-column and bigger particles.

The model predictions have been compared with experimental data and validated in a limited range of operating conditions: for lower solids fluxes of sand particles (dp= 0. 3 mm, mass fluxes below 40 kg/m 2 /s) at gas velocities higher than the terminal velocity UT of solids and for relatively high solid fluxes (over 160 kg/m 2 /s) and gas velocities higher and lower than UT. Predictions from the models were used to estimate effects of particle size, gas velocity in the pneumatic transport column and height of the FB on circulating mass flux of solids. Comparison of the model-computed and experimental mass fluxes of solids with a theoretical forecast for the saturation carrying capacity of gas in pneumatic transport and a forecast of ¿choking¿ as computed by use of the Yang correlation has indicated possible problems and instabilities of solids flow in regimes with higher solids mass fluxes and/or lower gas velocities in the riser (PT-column).
