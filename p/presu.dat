50|$|Niang {{was born}} in Meulan, a commune in the Yvelines {{department}} of the Île-de-France region, to Senegalese parents. He began his football career {{at the age of}} seven playing for local club Basse-Seine Les Mureaux. Niang spent two years at the club before being spotted by amateur club Poissy. After hearing of the player through word of mouth, Niang was spotted by professional club Caen scouts Laurent Glaize and David Lasry. Glaize later stated that before scouting the player, he was informed that Niang was possibly a <b>présu,</b> a player claiming to be younger than his actual date of birth. The claim was made primarily because of Niang's height, which stood at 1.75 m when he was 13 years old. Despite the claim, the scouts continued to pursue Niang, who was also being linked to other professional clubs in France, such as Lille and Paris Saint-Germain.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} opening a forward or futures market on spot price or real exchange rate variab ility in a two-agent, two-good, two-state, general-equilibrium model. This is shown to depend upon such familiar parameters as substitutio n elasticities, marginal propensities to consume, and degress of risk aversion. The analysis {{highlights the importance of}} the income trans fer, which occurs as a result of capital gains and losses in the forw ard market. The authors find some presumption in favor of the view th at opening a forward market reduces spot price variability. The <b>presu</b> mption is strengthened the less risk averse are agents.

60|$|O that thou wert serious! Is not it a {{thing to}} be lamented, that madness and folly should be in thy heart while thou livest, and after that {{to go to the}} dead, when so much life stands before thee, and light to see the way to it? (Eccl 9:3). Surely, men void of grace, and possessed of carnal minds, must either think that sin is nothing, that hell is easy, and that eternity is short; or else that {{whatever}} God has said about the punishing of sinners, he will never do as he has said; or that there is no sin, no God, no heaven, no hell, and so no good or bad hereafter; or else they could not live as they do. But perhaps thou <b>presumest</b> upon it, and sayest, I shall have peace, though I live so sinful a life. Sinner, if this wicked thought be in thy heart, tell me again, dost thou thus think in earnest? Canst thou imagine thou shalt at the day of account out-face God, or make him believe thou wast what thou wast not? or that when the gate of mercy is shut up in wrath, he will at thy pleasure, and to the reversing of his own counsel, open it again to thee? Why shall thy deceived heart turn thee aside, that thou canst not deliver thy soul, 'nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?' (Isa 44:20).|$|R
60|$|When the jailor cried out, 'Sirs, {{what must}} I {{do to be}} saved?' the answer was, 'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.' He that sees his sins aright, is brought to his wit's end by them; and he that is so, is willing to part from them, and to be saved {{by the grace of}} God. If this be thy case, fear not, give no way to despair; thou <b>presumest</b> not, if thou believest to life {{everlasting}} in Jesus Christ; yea, Christ is prepared for such as thou art. Therefore, take good courage, and believe. The design of Satan is, to tell the presumptuous that their presuming on mercy is good; but to persuade the believer, that his believing is impudent, bold dealing with God. I never heard a presumptuous man, in my life, say that he was afraid that he presumed; but I have heard many an honest humble soul say, that they have been afraid that their faith has been presumption. Why should Satan molest those whose ways he knows will bring them to him? And who can think that he should be quiet, when men take the right course to escape his hellish snares? This, therefore, is the reason why the truly humbled is opposed, while the presumptuous goes on by wind and tide. The truly humble, Satan hates; but he laughs to see the foolery of the other.|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{understand}} the mechanisms of sorting of mitochondrial inner membrane proteins, we have analyzed the import of subunit 9 of the mitochondrial F 1 F 0 -ATPase (Su 9) from Neurospora crassa, an integral inner membrane protein. A chimeric protein was used consisting of the presequence and the first transmembrane domain of Su 9 fused to mouse dihydrofolate reductase (<b>preSu</b> 9 (1 - 112) -DHFR). This protein attains the correct topology across the inner membrane (Nout-Cin) following import. The transmembrane domain becomes first completely imported into the matrix, where after processing of the presequence, it mediates membrane insertion and export of the N-terminal tail. Import and export steps can be experimentally dissected into two distinct events. Translocation of the N-terminal hydrophilic tail out of the matrix was blocked when the presequence was not processed, indicating an important role of the sequences and charges flanking the hydrophobic domain. Furthermore, export {{was supported by a}} delta pH and required matrix ATP hydrolysis. Thus the hydrophobic transmembrane domain operates as a membrane insertion signal and not as a stop-transfer signal. Our findings suggest that several aspects of this sorting process have been conserved from their prokaryotic ancestors...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{aim of this}} two-part {{article is}} to help readers in-corporate {{creativity}} in their information literacy teaching. Part One unpacked the creative process and aimed to demystify creativity, {{in order to make}} it accessible as a concept and pro-cess. The reader will recall that creativity involves asking ques-tions, identifying problems, and thinking broadly and different-ly about how to connect elements while working toward solu-tions and results. Part Two explores how librarians can apply this knowledge in adopting a creative approach to teaching information literacy and adding creative techniques to their repertoires. To do so, we must cultivate certain practices and habits that facilitate creative thinking and development in order to be ready for the challenges we face in our teaching. What is (and is not) Creativity in Teaching What does creativity look like in the context of teaching and learning? "In its simplest form, creative teaching can be defined as the act of teaching in a new and useful way " (Keller-Mathers, 2009, p. 197). Unfortunately, certain prevalent and influential notions can undermine creative teaching. For exa 1 n-ple, beware of what Edward de Bono calls "crazitivity, " which he characterizes as " [...] . solely driven by desire to be differ-ent " (1997). Being new, different, or entertaining, without clear purpose isn't creative if it doesn't address a need and produce something of discernible value. Similarly, avoid the te 1 nptation in teaching simply to "plug in " an interesting technique or ac-tivity you've read about or borrowed from so 1 neone else; con-sider first specific problems you want to address, and only cre-ate or adapt with definite purpose and direction. An example of this is the current trend of equating creativity or innovation in teaching with the use of new information technology or social media (Mishra, 2012). To be sure, many creative teaching prac-tices can involve such technology; however, you should not begin with a <b>presu</b> 1 nption that technological solutions will be the best or the only valuable one...|$|E
