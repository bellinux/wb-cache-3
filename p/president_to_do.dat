5|$|As a {{candidate}} for the Illinois state senate in 1996, Obama had said that he favored legalizing same-sex marriage. By the time of his Senate run in 2004, he said that he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners, but he opposed same-sex marriages for strategic reasons. On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. <b>president</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{spoke in}} front of the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on July 29, 2015, the first sitting U.S. <b>president</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. He gave a speech {{encouraging}} the world to increase economic ties via investments and trade with the continent, and lauded the progresses made in education, infrastructure, and economy. He also criticized the lack of democracy and leaders who refuse to step aside, discrimination against minorities (LGBT people, religious groups and ethnicities), and corruption. He suggested an intensified democratization and free trade, to significantly {{improve the quality of life}} for Africans. During his July 2015 trip, Obama also was the first U.S. president ever to visit Kenya, which is the homeland of his father.|$|E

Venediktov stated a Russian law that allowed to <b>President</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so and promote a law suggestion {{to name a}} street by decree.

25|$|The maximum {{duration}} of each Parliament is five years from the date of its first sitting. If Parliament has not been dissolved before that period has elapsed, it is automatically dissolved by operation of law. However, in most cases Parliament is dissolved and a general election called {{at the behest of}} the Prime Minister, who is entitled to advise the <b>President</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so by a proclamation published in the Government Gazette. The President is not obliged to proclaim that Parliament is dissolved unless he is satisfied that the Prime Minister commands the confidence of a majority of MPs. Once Parliament has been dissolved, a general election must be held within three months.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{the duties}} of the Czech President can be said to be {{ceremonial}} to one degree or another, especially since the President has relatively few powers independent of the will of the Prime Minister. A good example of this is the status as {{commander in chief of the}} military. No part of these duties can take place but through the assent of the Prime Minister. In matters of war, he is in every sense merely a figurehead, since the constitution gives all substantive constitutional authority over the use of the armed forces to the parliament. In fact, the only specific thing the constitution allows the <b>president</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with respect to the military is to appoint its generalsbut even this must be done with the signature of the Prime Minister.|$|E

50|$|Adams {{considered}} permanently {{retiring from}} public life after his 1828 defeat, {{and he was}} deeply hurt by the suicide of his son, George Washington Adams, in 1829. He was appalled {{by many of the}} Jackson administration's actions, including its embrace of the spoils system. Adams grew bored of his retirement and still felt that his career was unfinished, so he ran for and won a seat in the United States House of Representatives in the 1830 elections. His election went against the generally held opinion, shared by his own wife and youngest son, that former presidents should not run for public office. He was the first <b>president</b> <b>to</b> serve in Congress after his term of office, and one of only two former <b>presidents</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so (Andrew Johnson later served in the Senate).

Reagan's public appearances became much less frequent with the progression of the disease, and as a result, his family decided that he would live in quiet semi-isolation with his wife Nancy. Nancy Reagan told CNN's Larry King in 2001 that very few visitors were allowed to see her husband because she felt that [...] "Ronnie would want people to remember him as he was." [...] After her husband's diagnosis and death, Nancy Reagan became a stem-cell research advocate, urging Congress and President George W.

I can understand the passions it inspires. Its holiness, for the Muslims and the Christians, as for the Jews, cannot be dissociated from its existence as a city. That means that in order to retain its unique identity, its plurality must be preserved. The solution for Jerusalem cannot be solely religious, or solely national. It is necessary that freedom of access for the faithful, all the faithful, be guaranteed everywhere.
