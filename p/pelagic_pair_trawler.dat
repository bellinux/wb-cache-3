40|$|Research {{paper and}} presentationAlong the {{southern}} Sicilian coast (Central Mediterranean Sea), Sciacca harbor {{is the most}} important landing port for small pelagic fish species (manly anchovies and sardines) [1, 2]. This landing side accounts for about 2 / 3 of total catch in GFCM-FAO Geographical Sub-Area 16 (South of Sicily), where two operational units (OU) are presently active: purse seiners and <b>pelagic</b> <b>pair</b> <b>trawlers</b> [3]. The GSA 16 fleet is composed from 46 units (31 purse seiners and 15 <b>pelagic</b> <b>pair</b> trawlers; Community Fishing Fleet Register, [URL] In both OUs, anchovy represents the main target species due to the higher market price. Although small pelagic fishes are locally quite appreciated for direct fresh consumption, landings are always totally absorbed by Sciacca transformation (canning) companies’ high demand. Consequently, local consumption of fresh fish is relatively low, also because small pelagic fish are considered “poor” when compared to the wide fish variety in Sciacca market. This study analyzes the links between anchovy landings by <b>pelagic</b> <b>pair</b> <b>trawlers</b> and their market price from daily catch/price data collected in Sciacca harbor throughout the period March 1999 - December 2013...|$|R
40|$|Interactions between {{cetaceans}} (Cetacea) {{and fisheries}} are a widespread occurrence in the Mediterranean Sea and worldwide, effects of {{which range from}} positive to negative for one or both sides involved. We studied interactions between common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and different types of trawlers in the Gulf of Trieste and adjacent waters, {{as part of a}} long-term study on bottlenose dolphin ecology and conservation. We carried out visual boat- and land-based surveys between 2002 and 2012. During boat suveys, we opportunistically inspected operating trawlers for dolphin presence. When encountered, with or without trawlers, dolphins were followed for a variable amount of time, and photographed for identification purposes. Out of 205 recorded sightings, 22 % involved an interaction with trawlers. 51, 1 % of those interactions were with <b>pelagic</b> <b>pair</b> <b>trawlers,</b> while 46, 7 % were with (single) bottom trawlers. Even though the frequency of interactions among two types of trawlers was similar, dolphins appeared more likely to follow <b>pelagic</b> <b>pair</b> <b>trawlers,</b> with the fleet size 15 times smaller than that of bottom trawlers. Group size during interactions ranged from 1 to 28 individuals. Calves were present in almost half of all interactions. The animals followed trawlers for a variable amount of time, from 9 to 149 minutes. Photo-identification data showed that most recorded interactions involved the same identified individuals, while such behaviour was never observed in others. We also compared the frequency of interactions with trawler catch quantity and type. Both types of trawlers appear to attract dolphins and thus alter their movements and behaviour...|$|R

During autumn (October-November) of 1992 under the authority oft he Federal Atlantic Swordfish Regulations, the National Marine Fisheries Service placed observers aboard <b>pelagic</b> <b>pair</b> trawl vessels to document the catch, bycatch, discard, and gear used in this new fishery. The fishery is conducted primarily at night along shelf-edge waters from June to November. In late 1991, revised regulations restricted swordfish to bycatch in this fishery resulting in <b>pelagic</b> <b>pair</b> trawl vessels targeting tuna throughout 1992. Analyses of 1992 data indicate that albacore, T. alalunga, was the predominant species caught, although yellowfin tuna, T. albaeares, and bigeye tuna, T. obesus, were the preferred target species. Bycatch also included swordfish, large sharks, pelagic rays and other pelagic fishes, other tunas, and marine mammals...|$|R

40|$|Both {{natural and}} human-related {{foraging}} strategies by the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) {{have resulted in}} social segregation in several areas of the world. Bottlenose dolphins near Savannah, Georgia beg at an unprecedented rate and also forage behind commercial shrimp trawlers, providing an opportunity to study the social ramifications of two human-related foraging behaviors within {{the same group of}} animals. Dolphins were photo-identified via surveys conducted throughout estuarine waterways around Savannah in the summers of 2009 - 2011. Mean half-weight indices (HWI) were calculated for each foraging class, and community division by modularity was used to cluster animals based on association indices. <b>Pairs</b> of <b>trawler</b> dolphins had a higher mean HWI (0. 20 ± 0. 07) than pairs of non-trawler dolphins (0. 04 ± 0. 02) or mixed pairs (0. 02 ± 0. 02). In contrast, pairs of beggars, non-beggars, and mixed pairs all had similar means, with HWI between 0. 05 - 0. 07. Community division by modularity produced a useful division (0. 307) with 6 clusters. Clusters were predominately divided according to trawler status; however, beggars and non-beggars were mixed throughout clusters. Both the mean HWI and social clusters revealed that the social structure of common bottlenose dolphins near Savannah, Georgia was differentiated based on trawler status but not beg status. This finding may indicate that foraging in association with trawlers is a socially learned behavior, while the mechanisms for the propagation of begging are less clear. This study highlights the importance of taking into account the social parameters of a foraging behavior, such as how group size or competition for resources may affect how the behavior spreads. The positive or negative ramifications of homophily may influence whether the behaviors are exhibited by individuals within the same social clusters and should be considered in future studies examining social relationships and foraging behaviors...|$|R

Almost half (39 %) of the Indian population utilizes the marine fisheries resources. India ranked sixth worldwide in total fish production (4. 95 million t) and second in inland fish production (2. 24 million t) during 1995 - 96. Fish production expanded from 0. 75 million t in 1950 - 51 to 4. 95 million t in 1995 - 96, giving a significant increase at a cumulative growth rate of 4. 2 % per annum. Marine fish production increased from 0. 53 million t in 1950 - 51 to 2. 71 million t in 1995 - 96. The contribution of the fisheries sector to the total gross domestic product (GDP) improved from 0. 75 % in 1980 - 81 to 1. 28 % in 1994 - 95, with marine fisheries providing employment opportunities both in the production and post-harvest sectors. Subsidiary employment in fishing includes boat building and repair, net mending, repair of engines and supply of diesel, kerosene and other essential items. Women are mostly engaged in post-harvest operations like net mending, fish processing, packing and selling of fish and fish products. The contribution to foreign exchange earnings by the fishery sector substantially increased from Rs 46 crores in 1960 - 61 to Rs 4 697 (US$ 121 *) in 1997 - 98. India exports about 55 types of marine products to different countries in Southwest Asia, Europe and USA. The total quantity of marine product exports rose from 97 200 t in 1987 - 88 to 307 337 t in 1994 - 95 giving an equivalent export value of Rs 53 000 lakhs to Rs 357 500 lakhs**. The marine fishing sector can be classified into: (a) non-motorized artisanal sector using country craft with traditional gear; (b) motorized sector; (c) mechanized sector using inboard engines of 50 to 120 HP; and (d) deep sea fishing with bigger boats (25 m and above) and engines of 120 HP and above. In 1996, India had a total fishing fleet of 238 125 units comprising 160 000 traditional craft, 31 726 motorized craft (converted from traditional) and 46 918 mechanized vessels operating different gear combinations. For artisanal fishing, the use of canoe and boat seine in Kerala provided the highest net income of Rs 0. 10 lakh with an annual catch of 51 t and an initial investment of Rs 0. 85 lakh. In motorized fishing, canoe and ring seine in Kerala offered a net income of Rs 0. 98 lakh with an annual catch of 220 t and an initial investment of Rs 5. 0 lakh. All major fishing units in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat have higher profits not because of higher levels of fish catch but due to a better fish price. In the motorized sector, {{the increase in the}} price of fish over the years is greater than the increase in fuel expenditure. Small trawlers, purse seiners, dol-netters, gillnetters, <b>pair</b> <b>trawlers</b> and sona boats are the major types of mechanized fishing units operating in the inshore waters (up to 50 m depth). Trawlers and gillnetters are mostly operated along the Indian coasts whereas the fishing fleet mentioned above is confined to certain regions only. A small trawler (32 Ã† - 36 Ã†) has a net income of Rs 0. 90 lakh with an annual catch of 72 t and initial investment of Rs 5. 2 lakh in Karnataka. A purse seiner has a net earning of Rs 3. 14 lakh per year with an annual catch of 280 t and an average investment of Rs 10 lakh. However the average value of fish caught in a purse seiner is Rs 4. 29 per kg set against the break-even cost of Rs 3. 16 per kg. To assess the economic sustainability of Indian marine fisheries in the period 1985 to 1998, the surplus production model or Schaefer Model was applied. Based on this, the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) was estimated at 2 353 726 t with an estimated effort of 984 586 annual fishing hours (AFH). Using the Fox surplus production model, MSY was equal to 2 973 752 t with an effort of 6 126 232 AFH. Note that actual yield during that period was 2 441 043 t with an effort of 12 97 092 AFH. This is indicative of over-fishing in the Indian Sea and Bay of Bengal. A number of management strategies can be applied to reduce the fishing pressure on the coastal areas of India. These are: (a) a ban of certain fishing gear and restricted entry to over-exploited fishing grounds; (b) the promotion of alternative/subsidiary income and emphasizing the importance of mariculture/aquaculture; (c) effective implementation of small scale fishery development projects like infrastructure and service facilities; (d) coastal zone management including protection of marine habitats; and (e) information dissemination and education on the importance of fisheries resources.

40|$|An {{acoustic}} survey (PELGAS) {{is carried out}} {{every year in the}} Bay of Biscay in spring onboard the French research vessel Thalassa. The objective of PELGAS survey is to study the abundance and distribution of pelagic fish in the Bay of Biscay. The main target species are anchovy and sardine but they are considered in a multi-specific context and within an ecosystemic approach as they are located in the centre of pelagic ecosystem. The Pelgas 17 {{acoustic survey}} has been carried out with medium weather conditions (regular wind, low atmospheric temperatures) for the whole area, from the South of the bay of Biscay to the west of Brittany. The help of commercial vessels (two <b>pairs</b> of <b>pelagic</b> <b>trawlers</b> and a single one) during 18 days provided about 110 valid identification hauls instead of about 60 before 2007 when Thalassa was alone to identify echotraces. Their participation increased the precision of identification of echoes and some double hauls permitted to confirm that results provided by the two types of vessels (R/V and Fishing boats) were comparable and usable for biomass estimate purposes. These commercial vessels participated to the PELGAS survey in a very good spirit of collaboration. Vessels (and the scientific observer onboard) are founded by EMFF (European Maritime and Ficheries Found) for the period 2017 - 2019, with the financial help of "France Filière Pêche" which is a groupment of French fishing organisations. The PELGAS 17 survey observed a relatively high level of anchovy biomass (134 500 tons), which seems to be higher to previous year, comparable to 2011 and far away from the 2015 biomass The biomass estimate of sardine observed  is 465 022 tons, which constitutes a strong increase from the last survey...|$|R
