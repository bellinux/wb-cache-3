5|$|State schools provide {{textbooks}} free {{of charge}} to their students, while private schools generally require their students {{to pay for their}} textbooks, enabling the latter to change their textbooks and textbook editions more frequently. All primary schools have at least four computers, one printer, a large monitor and a teacher's laptop computer in their classrooms, while many secondary schools have specialised rooms necessary to teach subjects such as Home Economics and Food Technology. An average of 22.5 students are enrolled per primary school class, with the average rising to 24.3 in secondary school classes. Primary school teachers are expected to dedicate five hours <b>per</b> <b>week</b> to each of Maltese, English and mathematics, one hour <b>per</b> <b>week</b> to science, two hours per weeks to arts and crafts, two hours <b>per</b> <b>week</b> to social studies, one hour and 15 minutes <b>per</b> <b>week</b> to social studies, and {{two and a half hours}} <b>per</b> <b>week</b> to physical education and religion. State school syllabi at the secondary level are set by the local examination bodies.|$|E
5|$|By 1889, the Angle Mills {{site was}} the largest steel plate factory in the world. In 1892, in {{addition}} to steelmaking, the company had a foundry (a mile from Consett at Crookhall) capable of making 150 tons of iron castings <b>per</b> <b>week,</b> and a brickworks capable of making around 12,000 bricks <b>per</b> <b>week.</b> The estate had grown to roughly 2,700 workers' cottages. The company ran a 16-bed infirmary to treat injured workers. The 6,000 workers were paid an average of £5.33 a month.

5|$|Photochemotherapy, or PUVA, is {{considered}} superior to phototherapy because {{it produces a}} longer-lasting tolerance of the radiation that initiates the outbreak.

Therefore, treatments are regulated at three <b>per</b> <b>week</b> while constantly increasing the exposure to UVA radiation. Once the patient has reached an adequate level of desensitization, treatments are reduced to once or twice <b>per</b> <b>week.</b>|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{behavior}} of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in primates because direct observations and competitive-repopulation assays are not feasible. Therefore, we used 2 different and independent experimental strategies, the tracking of transgene expression after retroviral-mediated gene transfer (N = 11 baboons; N = 7 rhesus macaques) and quantitation of the average telomere length of granulocytes (N = 132 baboons; N = 14 macaques), together with stochastic methods, to study HSC kinetics in vivo. The average replication rate for baboon HSCs is once <b>per</b> 36 <b>weeks</b> according to gene-marking analyses and once <b>per</b> 23 <b>weeks</b> according to telomere-shortening analyses. Comparable results were derived from the macaque data. These rates are substantially slower than the average replication rates previously reported for HSCs in mice (once <b>per</b> 2. 5 <b>weeks)</b> and cats (once <b>per</b> 8. 3 <b>weeks).</b> Because baboons and macaques live for 25 to 45 years, much longer than mice (∼ 2 years) and cats (12 - 18 years), we can compute that HSCs undergo a relatively constant number (∼ 80 - 200) of lifetime replications. Thus, our data suggest that the self-renewal capacity of mammalian stem cells in vivo is defined and evolutionarily conserved...|$|R

These gradually became more regular and became de facto scheduled services every fortnight. Lufttransport replaced the helicopter service with a two-engine five-seat aircraft in 1989, which cut the cost of transport significantly. In 1993, Widerøe established itself at Svalbard Airport and flew services to Ny-Ålesund, but this only lasted the one season. In 1996, Lufttransport and Kings Bay made an agreement that the airline would fly once <b>per</b> <b>week</b> during the winter and up to five times <b>per</b> <b>week</b> during the summer.
