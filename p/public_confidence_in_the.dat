On June 16, Dodge and his men cornered about eleven of the raiders at a bend in the Pecatonica River. In a brief battle, the Americans killed and scalped all of the Natives.

5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of convincing {{evidence}} of toxicity of thiomersal when used as a vaccine preservative, the USPHS and AAP determined that thiomersal should be removed from vaccines as a purely precautionary measure. This action {{was based on the}} precautionary principle, which assumes that there is no harm in exercising caution even if it later turns out to be unnecessary. The CDC and AAP reasoned that despite {{the lack of}} evidence of significant harm in the use of thiomersal in vaccines, the removal of this preservative would increase the <b>public</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> safety of vaccines. Although thiomersal was largely removed from routine infant vaccines by summer 2001 in the U.S., some vaccines continue to contain non-trace amounts of thiomersal, mainly in multi-dose vaccines targeted against influenza and tetanus.|$|E

5|$|Sherman and Hayes {{agreed to}} {{stockpile}} gold {{in preparation for}} the exchange of greenbacks for specie. The Act remained unpopular in some quarters, leading to four attempts to repeal it in the Senate and fourteen in the House—all unsuccessful. By this time, <b>public</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Treasury had grown to the extent that a dollar in gold was worth only $1.05 in greenbacks. Once the public was confident that they could redeem greenbacks for gold, few actually did so; when the Act took effect in 1879, only $130,000 out of the $346,000,000 outstanding dollars in greenbacks were redeemed. Greenbacks were now at parity with gold dollars, and the nation had, {{for the first time since}} the Civil War, a unified monetary system.|$|E

Milgrim is addicted to anti-anxiety drugs, and is kept docile and compliant by Brown, who controls his supply of Rize. Brown believes that Tito and the old man are in possession of information that would, if revealed, undermine <b>public</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S.'s participation in the Iraq War. In his attempts to capture them and their data, however, Brown is instead fed disinformation through the old man's intricate schemes.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary jury {{consultants}} {{are often}} sociologists, people {{with experience in}} communications and marketing, or attorneys themselves, but they are most frequently psychologists and specialize in legal psychology. Although most of the practice's roots are in criminal trials, modern jury consultants are more often involved in torts (civil litigation), particularly where wealthy corporate defendants fear an enormous monetary judgment for the plaintiff, or where plaintiffs’ attorneys have invested {{large sums of money}} in an important lawsuit. Since the 1980s, large jury consulting and trial consulting firms have sprouted up with multi-million dollar incomes, mostly from such high-stakes civil litigation. The simultaneous shift from ad-hoc groups of academics to a business model has sparked the criticism that SJS magnifies the distorting effect money has on trials, since only the wealthy can afford it. Jury consultants argue that they operate in an adversarial process the same way lawyers do; by pursuing their clients' interests in a rule-bound framework. Jeffrey Abramson, who has written extensively about juries, argues that even if SJS is ethical or has zero effect, the mere myth of powerful, effective jury manipulators shakes <b>public</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jury system.|$|E

25|$|Some {{commentators}} have expressed {{the view that}} excessive value has been placed by the courts on protecting {{the independence of the}} judiciary, and that insufficient weight has been given to the right to freedom of speech. One assumption said to be incorrect is that undermining <b>public</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> administration of justice is in all circumstances harmful to the public interest. Arguably, if the scandalizing allegation is true or is an opinion honestly and reasonably held, then it is in the public interest that such speech be heard precisely because {{of the importance of the}} judiciary to society. However, common law rules of contempt do not recognize the defence of either justification or fair comment which are available to the tort of defamation. Secondly, the claim that scandalizing the court may undermine <b>public</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> judiciary represents an unduly pessimistic view of the maturity and ability of the Singapore public to assess for itself whether or not the scandalizing speech is true, and is perhaps a sweeping statement as to general public awareness. Lastly, it is also assumed that <b>public</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> judiciary can be preserved by the suppression of scandalizing speech. However, it is unlikely that such speech can ever be completely suppressed. It would be impossible to monitor speech that goes on in homes, coffee shops and hawker centres. Through these informal channels, suspicions of the judiciary may fester and grow.|$|E
