40|$|Autor u radu razmatra utjecaje i posljedice koji su rezultirali izrazitim porastom broja notarskih isprava u razdoblju od sredine 13. do kraja 15. stoljeća i to u svim urbanim središtima istočnojadranske obale, od Poreča do Kotora. Ovu pojavu nastoji protumačiti kao posljedicu porasta broja bilježničkih kancelarija u komunama i gradovima, utjecajem pravnih odnosno statutarnih odredbi, težnjom pojedinaca da svoje svakodnevno poslovanje zabilježe u obliku privatno-pravnih isprava, ali i intimnom željom za memoriranjem osoba u budućim generacijama. Upravo zahvaljujući procesu demokratizacije u pisanju privatno-pravnih isprava, prije svega serijskih tipova građe, danas su otvorena široka znanstvena prostranstva koja omogućuju istraživanje raznih aspekata urbanog života u razvijenom i kasnom srednjem vijeku. In {{the first}} part of the article the author {{examines}} factors which influenced the significant increase in number of <b>private</b> <b>documents</b> written by notaries from the second half of the thirteenth until the end of the fifteenth century in all communal centres on the East Adriatic coast – from Poreč to Kotor. In contrast to the period from the ninth to the beginning of the thirteenth century, when <b>private</b> <b>documents</b> were recorded exclusively for individuals belonging to the elite layers of East Adriatic urban societies, the period of the last decades of the High Middle Ages and the entire period of the Late Middle Ages was characterized by continuous growth in the number of <b>private</b> <b>documents</b> for both male and female, poor and rich, citizens and inhabitants, domicile population and foreigners. Starting from the end of the thirteenth century, the practice of recording <b>private</b> <b>documents</b> spread even to the rural areas belonging to the Adriatic communes and from decade to decade more and more villagers (villici, villani) traveled from their villages in districts to cities in order to record certain <b>private</b> <b>document.</b> Inspired by the research done on Italian city of Siena by Samuel K. Cohn, the author accepts the term “process of democratization” as the most appropriate in defining that historical process which enables the analysis of various topics related to social, economic, religious and other aspects of daily life in communal – rural and urban – societies on the East Adriatic coast. The author concludes that the “process of democratization” in recording <b>private</b> <b>documents</b> was the consequence of two main factors: the significant growth in number of Italian notaries (from the fourteenth century onwards, Croatian notaries also studied in Bologna or Padua) employed by communal and urban civil authorities, as well as codification of statute laws which started from the second half of the thirteenth century. Statute laws were particularly important since they contained different paragraphs related to various fields of private law that obliged all adult individuals regardless of their social status and gender to possess written confirmation of their important dealings, such were, for instance, various business contracts. One of the consequences of the “process of democratization” was the fact that in the fourteenth and especially in the fifteenth century there was almost no adult men or women who did not compose some document, at least their last wills in forms of testaments or breviaries (breviarium) and inventories of goods in one of many notary offices situated all over cities. Therefore, the period of anonymous masses or individuals with no name became past. It may be concluded that the “process of democratization” in writing of <b>private</b> <b>documents</b> in notary offices widely opened the door for the research of many specific scholarly fields related to the period from the middle of the thirteenth to the end of the fifteenth century...|$|R

50|$|The second mode {{of human}} {{evidence}} is documents. As helpful as witnesses are in trials, “the ancient authors have been {{fully aware of}} the extreme weakness of human memory: if made after a certain lapse of time, the deposition of witnesses loses its validity because they are likely to have forgotten many an important detail.” Therefore, a second form of evidence that may be presented at trial is that of a document, which is considered more reliable evidence than witness testimony. There are two types of documents as prescribed by vyavahāra: public and <b>private</b> <b>documents.</b> The two major forms of public documents (although there are more) are official grants of land or the like, and documents of success (delivered by the king to the victorious party in a lawsuit). These documents, due to their official nature, do not need to meet many criterion to be taken as reliable evidence. <b>Private</b> <b>documents,</b> on the other hand, which include principal civil transactions (partitions, gifts, mortgages, debts, etc.) have to meet far more conditions. There are many possible defects of <b>private</b> <b>documents</b> that would render them illegitimate evidence. For one, the person who created the document can’t be a child or mentally insane, and they can’t have been intoxicated or under fear or misfortune when drawing up the document. Additionally, the content of the document needs to be very descriptive. It needs to clearly indicate the nature of the subject and describe details of all persons involved and bear the exact date and place of the transaction.|$|R
