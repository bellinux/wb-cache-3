5|$|Carbohydrates make up {{the bulk}} of the fruit bodies, {{comprising}} 9.23% of the fresh weight (see table), and 65.4% of the dry weight. The carbohydrate component contains the monosaccharides glucose, mannitol and α,α-trehalose, the <b>polysaccharide</b> glycogen, and the water-insoluble structural <b>polysaccharide</b> chitin, which accounts for up to 80–90% of dry matter in mushroom cell walls. Chitin, hemicellulose, and pectin-like carbohydrates—all indigestible by humans—contribute to the nutritionally desirable high proportion of insoluble fibre in B.edulis.|$|E

Experiments in the 1980s concluded that two glucans isolated from the species showed potent antitumour properties when used on mice artificially implanted with Sarcoma 180 tumours. This was despite the conclusion of earlier research indicating that, while aqueous extracts from several other fungal species had antitumour effects, extracts from A.auricula-judae did not. Further, research on genetically diabetic mice showed that a <b>polysaccharide</b> extracted from A.auricula-judae had a hypoglycemic effect; mice fed with food including the <b>polysaccharide</b> showed reduced plasma glucose, insulin, urinary glucose and food intake.|$|E

40|$|This chapter summarises {{important}} issues about the molecular and supramolecular structure of <b>polysaccharides.</b> It describes the terminology of <b>polysaccharides</b> systematically. The <b>polysaccharides</b> are divided regarding the molecular structures in glucans, polyoses, <b>polysaccharides</b> with amino functions, <b>polysaccharides</b> with acid functions and some miscellaneous. The most important glucans cellulose, (1 → 3) -β-d-glucans, starch, glycogen, dextran and pullulan are discussed. For polyoses, xylans, mannans, xyloglucans and mixed-linkage β-glucans are described. <b>Polysaccharides</b> with amino functions include {{the description of}} chitin and chitosan, hyaluronan or hyaluronic acid, glycosaminoglycans and murein.

5|$|Some Tremella species produce polysaccharides {{that are}} of {{interest}} to the medical field, because of their biological activity; several patents have been filed in China pertaining to the use of these compounds for cancer prevention or immune system enhancement. In 1966, Slodki reported discovering an acidic <b>polysaccharide</b> from haploid cells of T.mesenterica that closely resembled those produced by the species Cryptococcus laurentii. The structural similarity of the polysaccharides from the two species suggested a phylogenetic relationship between them. Subsequently, researchers chemically synthesized the <b>polysaccharide,</b> and determined the chemical identities of the component sugar units. The <b>polysaccharide,</b> known as glucuronoxylomannan—produced by fruit bodies and in pure culture conditions—has been shown to consist of a mannan backbone that is glycosylated with xylan chains in a regular repeating structure. Laboratory tests have associated a number of biological activities with T.mesenterica glucuronoxylomannan, including immunostimulatory, protecting against radiation, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, hypocholesterolemic, hepatoprotective, and antiallergic effects.|$|E

40|$|Fungal <b>polysaccharides</b> {{display a}} variety of {{important}} biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and immune-stimulating activities. The aim of {{present study was to}} investigate the immunomodulatory effect of fungal <b>polysaccharides</b> on cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression in mice. Mice were pretreated orally with lentinan, tremellan, pachymaran, or a mixture of the three, respectively. The results showed that pretreatments with <b>polysaccharides</b> significantly increased the thymus index in cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression mice. The level of the cytokine IL- 10 in sera of cyclophosphamide-induced mice was decreased after pretreatments of <b>polysaccharides.</b> Flow cytometry results showed that pretreatments with <b>polysaccharides</b> enhanced the phagocytosis of peritoneal macrophages in mice.

40|$|<b>Polysaccharides</b> are a {{critical}} component of many food stuffs owing to their stable rheological properties. Food <b>polysaccharides</b> show great structural diversity. These characteristics, together with strong matrix interactions, complicate the quantitative assessment of <b>polysaccharides</b> in complex product formulations. Most current analytical approaches rely on qualitative identification of <b>polysaccharides</b> and quantification based on monosaccharide analysis. NMR for example has typically been applied for qualitative purposes but recently {{progress has been made in}} semi-quantification. However employing this technique for the absolute quantitative assessment <b>polysaccharides</b> is less straightforward. This is primarily due to broadened and overlapping lineshapes, which compromise NMR signal integration. In this chapter the authors describe the hybrid NMR approach that they have developed in response to this problem for quantifying <b>polysaccharides</b> in food products.

5|$|Biologically active {{mushroom}} polysaccharides {{have been}} a frequent research topic in recent decades due to their possible stimulatory effect on innate and cell-mediated immune responses, antitumor activities, and other activities. Immunostimulatory activity, antioxidant activity, cholesterol-lowering, and blood sugar-lowering effects have been detected in extracts of R.virescens fruit bodies, which are attributed to polysaccharides. A water-insoluble beta-glucan, RVS3-II, has been isolated from the fruit bodies. Sulfated derivatives of this compound have antitumor activities against sarcoma tumor cell lines. RVP, a water-soluble <b>polysaccharide</b> present in the mushroom, is made largely of galactomannan subunits and has antioxidant activity.|$|E
5|$|Polysaccharides and glycans {{are made}} by the {{sequential}} addition of monosaccharides by glycosyltransferase from a reactive sugar-phosphate donor such as uridine diphosphate glucose (UDP-glucose) to an acceptor hydroxyl group on the growing <b>polysaccharide.</b> As any of the hydroxyl groups on the ring of the substrate can be acceptors, the polysaccharides produced can have straight or branched structures. The polysaccharides produced can have structural or metabolic functions themselves, or be transferred to lipids and proteins by enzymes called oligosaccharyltransferases.|$|E
40|$|Background: Cactus <b>polysaccharides</b> are {{the active}} {{components}} of Opuntia dillenii {{which have been}} used extensively in folk medicine. In this study, we investigate the anti-tumor effect of cactus <b>polysaccharides</b> on lung squamous carcinoma cells SK-MES- 1. Materials and Methods: The inhibitory effect of Cactus <b>polysaccharides</b> on lung squamous carcinoma cells were detected by MTT assay. Cell cycle was determined by flow cytometry and cell apoptosis was determined by AnnexinV assay. Western-blotting was applied to detect P 53 and PTEN protein expression in the cells treated with cactus <b>polysaccharides.</b> Results: Results showed that different concentrations of wild cactus <b>polysaccharides</b> prevent SK-MES- 1 cells growth and induces S phase arrest. The data also revealed that cactus <b>polysaccharides</b> cause apoptosis in SK-MES- 1 cells determined by Annexin-V assay. Furthermore, cactus <b>polysaccharides</b> induced growth arrest and apoptosis {{may be due to}} the increase of P 53 and phosphatase and tension homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) protein.

5|$|Rhabdomyolysis is {{recognized}} in horses. Horses {{can develop a}} number of muscle disorders, many of which may progress to rhabdomyolysis. Of these, some cause isolated attacks of rhabdomyolysis (e.g., dietary deficiency in vitamin E and selenium, poisoning associated with pasture or agricultural poisons such as organophosphates), while others predispose to exertional rhabdomyolysis (e.g., the hereditary condition equine <b>polysaccharide</b> storage myopathy). 5–10% of thoroughbred horses and some standardbred horses suffer from the condition equine exertional rhabdomyolysis; no specific cause has been identified, but an underlying muscle calcium regulation disorder is suspected.|$|E
5|$|Measures {{to prevent}} {{opportunistic}} infections {{are effective in}} many people with HIV/AIDS. In addition to improving current disease, treatment with antiretrovirals {{reduces the risk of}} developing additional opportunistic infections. Adults and adolescents who are living with HIV (even on anti-retroviral therapy) with no evidence of active tuberculosis in settings with high tuberculosis burden should receive isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), the tuberculin skin test can be used to help decide if IPT is needed. Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is advised for all people at risk of HIV before they become infected; however it may also be given after infection. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis between four and six weeks of age and ceasing breastfeeding in infants born to HIV positive mothers is recommended in resource limited settings. It is also recommended to prevent PCP when a person's CD4 count is below 200cells/uL and in those who have or have previously had PCP. People with substantial immunosuppression are also advised to receive prophylactic therapy for toxoplasmosis and MAC. Appropriate preventive measures have reduced the rate of these infections by 50% between 1992 and 1997. Influenza vaccination and pneumococcal <b>polysaccharide</b> vaccine are often recommended in people with HIV/AIDS with some evidence of benefit.|$|E
5|$|The 20 {{amino acids}} encoded {{directly}} by the genetic code {{can be divided into}} several groups based on their properties. Important factors are charge, hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity, size, and functional groups. These properties are important for protein structure and protein–protein interactions. The water-soluble proteins tend to have their hydrophobic residues (Leu, Ile, Val, Phe, and Trp) buried {{in the middle of the}} protein, whereas hydrophilic side chains are exposed to the aqueous solvent. (Note that in biochemistry, a residue refers to a specific monomer within the polymeric chain of a <b>polysaccharide,</b> protein or nucleic acid.) The integral membrane proteins tend to have outer rings of exposed hydrophobic amino acids that anchor them into the lipid bilayer. In the case part-way between these two extremes, some peripheral membrane proteins have a patch of hydrophobic amino acids on their surface that locks onto the membrane. In similar fashion, proteins that have to bind to positively charged molecules have surfaces rich with negatively charged amino acids like glutamate and aspartate, while proteins binding to negatively charged molecules have surfaces rich with positively charged chains like lysine and arginine. There are different hydrophobicity scales of amino acid residues.|$|E

5|$|The {{newly created}} xylem is the sapwood. It is {{composed}} of water-conducting cells and associated cells which are often living, and is usually pale in colour. It transports water and minerals from the roots to the upper parts of the tree. The oldest, inner part of the sapwood is progressively converted into heartwood as new sapwood is formed at the cambium. The conductive cells of the heartwood are blocked in some species, and the surrounding cells are more often dead. Heartwood is usually darker in colour than the sapwood. It is the dense central core of the trunk giving it rigidity. Three quarters of the dry mass of the xylem is cellulose, a <b>polysaccharide,</b> {{and most of the}} remainder is lignin, a complex polymer. A transverse section through a tree trunk or a horizontal core will show concentric circles or lighter or darker wood - tree rings.
