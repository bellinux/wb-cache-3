Two hundred and seventy witnesses were involved. The phase one hearings began on 26 September 2001 and finished on 31 July 2002; it was originally supposed to end on 4 February 2002 but late documents caused delays. <b>Phase</b> <b>two</b> of the inquiry, taking place between 15 March 2002 and 26 April 2002, took the form of five seminars, which looked at the child protection system in general. It was chaired by Garnham and brought together experts in all aspects of child protection.|$|E

5|$|A station {{here was}} part of the {{abandoned}} <b>phase</b> <b>two</b> expansion of the Fleet line (now Jubilee line). It had originally been planned in 1943, and was revived as a major transport plan in 1965. London Transport spent £10m (now £m) in 1972 safeguarding the route underneath Cannon Street and building reinforcements for laying a tube in the water-bearing ground around the station. The plan was abandoned in the early 1980s in favour of the current extension further south.|$|E

The nearly constant observed oxygen concentration in γ phase is considered as the oxygen maximum solubility in this phase (~ 200 at. ppm). The oxygen excess which exists in normal alloys either leads to an oxide precipitation in single phase alloys or is absorbed in the [MATH] <b>phase</b> of <b>two</b> <b>phase</b> alloys.

5|$|On {{this section}} of the line, there is Communications-based train control (CBTC) {{equipment}} on the southbound express track between Fourth Avenue and Church Avenue, as part of the automation of the New York City Subway. The total cost is $99.6 million, with $15 million coming from the 2005–2009 capital budget (phase one) and $84.6 million from the 2010–2014 capital budget (<b>phase</b> <b>two).</b> The installation is a joint venture between Siemens and Thales Group, and is used to test the track's new signaling on R143s and R160s that are already equipped with CBTC. The estimated completion date was scheduled for March 2015; the installation is expected to be permanent. If Culver Line express service is implemented in 2017 as it was proposed, the express service would not initially use CBTC, and testing of CBTC on the express track will be limited to off-peak hours. The local tracks in this section would also get CBTC as part of the 2015–2019 Capital Program.|$|E

Phase 2.3 added the Electronic Warfare suite upgrade (Radar Warning Receiver, Radio Frequency Jammer) and phase 2.4 upgraded with the Target Designation System (HTDS). The following support systems will also be either upgraded or replaced, the Operational Flight Trainer (OFT) {{to be replaced by}} the Hornet Aircrew Training System (HACTS), the Integrated Avionics Software Support Facility (IASSF), the Mission Planning System (MPS), Miscellaneous Support Equipment (SE), Computer Based Training System (CBTS), Simulated Aircraft Maintenance Training System (SAMTS) to be replaced by the Integrated Maintenance Training System (IMTS).|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Omar {{originated}} from a tropical disturbance that was first noted on August20 over the open Pacific Ocean, which exhibited persistent convection, or thunderstorms. During this early <b>phase,</b> <b>two</b> tropical cyclones dissipated and another became extratropical across the western Pacific basin; this caused the monsoon trough, which spawned {{most of the}} storms in the basin, to realign in a more climatologically appropriate manner. According to the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA), Omar developed into a tropical depression at 1800UTC on August23. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) assessed a slower pace of strengthening, issuing a tropical cyclone formation alert at 2100UTC before initiating advisories on Tropical Depression15W on August24.|$|E

5|$|Group C's 9th Tabor had also, {{like the}} M-24s of Group B, {{struggled}} through the marshes {{during the first}} phase of the operation, and were late in arriving at the jumping-off point for <b>phase</b> <b>two,</b> the canal. At 08:45, Moroccan units of Group C were investigating the village of Phu An on the opposite side of the lagoon from Group D's landing area, when they came under heavy fire. Despite being nearer to Group D, the engaged units radioed their immediate commanders back in Group C, who were by now some distance away, further inland. This delay, coupled with the failure of many of the units' SCR300 radios, meant that these advance elements of Group C failed to get through until 09:10. At 09:40, the commander of Group C called up various reinforcements from Hué including two companies of Vietnamese trainee NCOs and five infantry companies, two of which came via landing craft and did not reach the beleaguered elements of Group C until 18:00, half an hour after the Moroccans had finally counter-attacked and occupied Phu-An. The 2nd Battalion of the Parachute Chasseurs Regiment had been requested to drop at 14:00 to support the advanced elements of Group C but did not jump until 16:50 and thus failed to assemble before the Moroccans themselves occupied Phu-An. With the final capture of Phu-An, the extreme southern tip of the encirclement, the pincer movement was complete.|$|E
5|$|The {{portion of}} NY252 in Henrietta between Marketplace Drive and Ridgeland Road was widened {{from four to}} six lanes {{as part of a}} multi-year, $15.6million project that began in mid-2009. Phase one of the five-phase project, {{completed}} {{during the second half of}} 2009, involved the relocation of utility poles and water mains. The next four phases involved the actual widening of the highway. During <b>phase</b> <b>two,</b> all traffic on Jefferson Road was routed along the eastbound lanes while the westbound half of the road was reconstructed and widened; this was reversed during phase three. A raised median between the two directions, which prohibited left-hand turns at all points except signalized intersections, was constructed during phase four, and phase five covered the finishing touches of the project. As part of the project, the intersection between Jefferson Road and East Henrietta Road (NY15A) was widened to have two dedicated left turn lanes in all four directions. Work on the last four phases began on March29, 2010, and was expected to be fully completed in November 2011. Construction did get completed in November 2011, but at the cost of $16.5million (2012USD) instead of the original $15.6million.|$|E
