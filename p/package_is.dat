5|$|F-16V: At the 2012 Singapore Air Show Lockheed Martin {{unveiled}} {{plans for}} the new F-16V variant with the V suffix for its Viper nickname. It is to feature an {{active electronically scanned array}} (AESA) radar, a new mission computer and electronic warfare suite, and various cockpit improvements; this <b>package</b> <b>is</b> an option on current production F-16s and can be retrofitted to most in service F-16s. First flight took place 21 October, 2015. Production run to upgrade Taiwan's F-16 fleet started January, 2017.|$|E
5|$|In December 2008, Paul Krugman {{released}} his book The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008, arguing that economic {{conditions similar to}} what existed during the earlier part of the 20th century had returned, making Keynesian policy prescriptions more relevant than ever. In February 2009 Robert J. Shiller and George Akerlof published , a book where they argue the current US stimulus <b>package</b> <b>is</b> too small as {{it does not take}} into account Keynes's insight on the importance of confidence and expectations in determining the future behaviour of businesspeople and other economic agents.|$|E
5|$|The Electra {{communications}} <b>package</b> <b>is</b> a UHF {{software-defined radio}} (SDR) {{that provides a}} flexible platform for evolving relay capabilities. It is designed to communicate with other spacecraft as they approach, land, and operate on Mars. In addition to protocol controlled inter-spacecraft data links of 1kbit/s to 2Mbit/s, Electra also provides Doppler data collection, open loop recording and a highly accurate timing service based on a 5e13USO. Doppler information for approaching vehicles {{can be used for}} final descent targeting or descent and landing trajectory recreation. Doppler information on landed vehicles will also enable scientists to accurately determine the surface location of Mars landers and rovers. The two MER spacecraft currently on Mars utilize an earlier generation UHF relay radio providing similar functions through the Mars Odyssey orbiter. The Electra radio has proven its functionality by relaying information to and from the MER spacecraft, Phoenix Mars lander and Curiosity rover.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this article, {{the notion}} of {{orthogonal}} nonseparable five-variant wavelet <b>packages,</b> whi-ch <b>is</b> the generalization of orthogonal univariate wavelet <b>packages,</b> <b>is</b> introduced. A new approach for constructing the wavelet <b>packages</b> <b>is</b> presented by iteration method as well wavelet frames. The orthogonality properties for five-dimensional wavelet <b>packages</b> <b>are</b> discussed. Three orthogonality formulas concerning these wavelet <b>packages</b> <b>are</b> estabished.

25|$|One of the {{elements}} of the package will be the software package. The software <b>package</b> <b>is</b> a package in itself, because it consists of the different software components that together form the product. In contrast with the overall package, the software <b>package</b> <b>is</b> always a technical package in which all the files needed are combined in order to run the software product. Another concept of the software <b>package</b> <b>is</b> the version. This keeps track of the modifications made to the software product. By relating it to the software package the vendor and the customer are able {{to keep track of the}} functionality and properties of the product the customer is using.|$|E

25|$|E.g.: An ERP <b>package</b> <b>is</b> {{bought for}} which the most basis module is first installed, after which {{successive}} functional modules are (bought and) installed when they are needed. This approach is somewhat related to the 'phased' approach for the adoption of software.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} applying the carbon {{to the surface}} of the iron involved packing the iron in a mixture of ground bone and charcoal or a combination of leather, hooves, salt and urine, all inside a well-sealed box. This carburizing <b>package</b> <b>is</b> then heated to a high temperature but still under the melting point of the iron and left at that temperature for a length of time. The longer the <b>package</b> <b>is</b> held at the high temperature, the deeper the carbon will diffuse into the surface. Different depths of hardening are desirable for different purposes: sharp tools need deep hardening to allow grinding and resharpening without exposing the soft core, while machine parts like gears might need only shallow hardening for increased wear resistance.|$|E

25|$|Ultra Heat Treatment (UHT), {{is a type}} of milk {{processing}} where all bacteria are destroyed with high heat to extend its shelf life for up to 6 months, as long as the <b>package</b> <b>is</b> not opened. Milk is firstly homogenized and then is heated to 138 degrees Celsius for 1–3 seconds. The milk is immediately cooled down and packed into a sterile container. As a result of this treatment, all the pathogenic bacteria within the milk are destroyed, unlike when the milk is just pasteurised. The milk will now keep for up for 6 months if unopened. UHT milk {{does not need to be}} refrigerated until the <b>package</b> <b>is</b> opened, which makes it easier to ship and store. But in this process there is a loss of vitamin B1 and vitamin C and there is also a slight change in the taste of the milk.|$|E
