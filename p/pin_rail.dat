50|$|A <b>pin</b> <b>rail,</b> {{originally}} a wood beam, is typically a large-diameter round steel tube with vertical through-holes that accept belaying pins {{used in a}} hemp rigging system. Depending on the <b>pin</b> <b>rail</b> design, the pins may be removable or permanently fixed to the rail. Pin rails are typically installed permanently at the onstage edge of the fly gallery(ies), extending from the proscenium wall to upstage wall, sometimes in a stacked (rail over rail) arrangement. Mobile pin rails may also be used and are bolted down to the stage deck where needed.|$|E
5000|$|Although a fife rail {{is a kind}} of <b>pin</b> <b>rail,</b> {{the term}} [...] "pin rail" [...] is often used to {{specifically}} denote those rails containing belaying pins that are attached to the hull. Unlike these, fife rails are freestanding.|$|E
50|$|Elissa has an iron hull, and the <b>pin</b> <b>rail</b> {{and bright}} work {{is made of}} teak. Her masts are Douglas fir from Oregon, and her 19 sails were made in Maine. She has survived {{numerous}} modifications including installation of an engine, and the incremental removal of all her rigging and masts.|$|E
5000|$|Going {{into the}} 2010 Kentucky Derby, Lookin At Lucky was made the {{favorite}} after the scratch of Eskendereya. Drawing {{the number one}} inside post, he was <b>pinned</b> to the <b>rail</b> and {{had nowhere to go}} until a late run to wind up sixth, making it his first off-the-board finish.|$|R
40|$|This Bachelor’s thesis {{deals with}} {{the design of a}} crane crab lifting gear with a load {{capacity}} of 10, 000 kg. Based on the entered parameters, the rope, rope drum, balancing pulley, and the block pulley’s main body parts, such as guide pulley, piston <b>pins,</b> side <b>rails</b> and crosspiece, are calculated. The thesis also includes a strength check of the rope drum and the individual parts of the block pulley, the draft of the lifting gear’s drive as well as the drawings of the block pulley set and selected parts...|$|R
50|$|The {{forerunner of}} the railway in Germany, as in England, {{was to be}} found mainly in {{association}} with the mining industry. Mine carts were used below ground for transportation, initially using wooden rails, and were steered either by a guide <b>pin</b> between the <b>rails</b> or by flanges on the wheels.|$|R
50|$|Another hand line, {{known as}} a jack line, {{may be used to}} lift the sandbags if they are heavier than the batten load. (UNSAFE condition) The jack line, which runs up to a loft block and back down to the trim clamp, is tied off to a {{belaying}} pin adjacent to the one used for the line sets lift lines, either at the same, or a secondary, <b>pin</b> <b>rail.</b>|$|E
50|$|Belaying pins {{are used}} to belay, {{temporarily}} tie off, the rope lines of a hemp system. Each belaying pin serves as an anchor to which the loose end of a rope may be quickly secured. A standardized method is used to tie off the rope {{so that it is}} subjected to friction from itself {{as well as from the}} <b>pin</b> <b>rail,</b> thus ensuring a secure connection that is unlikely to fail. Belaying pins are typically made of hickory wood or steel.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a typical}} hemp system, a [...] "line set" [...] {{consists}} of multiple hemp lines running from a batten above the stage {{up to the}} grid, through loft blocks to a headblock and then down to the fly floor where they are tied off in a group to a belaying pin on the <b>pin</b> <b>rail.</b> The lift lines and hand (operating) lines {{are one and the}} same. Typically, a lift line runs from the sand bag (counterweight) assigned to a specific line set, up to [...] "a single loft block" [...] above the fly floor and back down to the fly floor. A trim clamp (a.k.a. knuckle-buster) or a [...] "Sunday" [...] (a circle of wire rope) is used to attach this sandbag to the [...] "line set" [...] to balance the load placed on the batten. The sandbags are usually filled to weigh the same as the loads, making the two weights (the weight of the batten and the weight of the bag) equal. This arrangement assures greater safety. When the flyman wishes to fly a batten (scenery or lights) [...] "In" [...] (i.e., to the floor), the flyman pulls down on the lift line thereby raising the sandbag off the fly floor and the batten descends. When the flyman wishes to fly the batten [...] "Out", he pulls down on the line set (leaving it tied off) and the batten flies out as the sand bag descends to the flyfloor. This arrangement allows the flyman to control the speed of ascent and/or descent and provides greater safety for people on the stage below. The proper [...] "Out" [...] position for the batten is set when the sand bag reaches the fly floor in its descent (adjustable) and the proper [...] "In" [...] position for the batten is established when the line set (previously tied off to the <b>pin</b> <b>rail)</b> is fully extended (adjustable). This makes it unnecessary to [...] "spike" [...] or [...] "mark" [...] either the line set or the lift line. (An [...] "unbalanced working line set" [...] should never be allowed to exist over the stage.) ...|$|E
500|$|Rudyard Kipling {{described}} his 1889 {{ride through the}} canyon in the following words: [...] "We entered a gorge, remote from the sun, where the rocks were two thousand feet sheer, and where a rock splintered river roared and howled ten feet below a track which {{seemed to have been}} built on the simple principle of dropping miscellaneous dirt into the river and <b>pinning</b> a few <b>rails</b> a-top. There was a glory and a wonder and a mystery about the mad ride, which I felt keenly..." ...|$|R
5000|$|It is {{generally}} accepted {{that a few}} distinct causes lie behind different wavelengths of railroad corrugation. One study indicates that the specific short-wave railroad deformity is mainly caused by pinned-pinned resonance, in which the rail vibrates as a fixed beam, as if pinned between periodically placed sleepers. The dynamic train-track interaction that causes fixed frequency vibrations at high speeds, commonly observed in light load metro operations, and the anti-resonance caused by the <b>pinning</b> of the <b>rails</b> on sleepers, causes deformation and the [...] "roaring" [...] corrugation of the rails.|$|R
50|$|According to legend, {{the first}} mate, John Rivers, a rival for {{the hand of}} the captain's young wife, was pacing the decks in jealous anger. While the captain, his wife and their guests were celebrating the {{marriage}} below deck, the first mate was seized with a fit of jealous rage. Casually drawing a heavy, club-like belaying <b>pin</b> from the <b>rail,</b> the mate walked softly up behind the crew member at the wheel and felled him to the deck with one crushing blow. Rivers then seized the wheel and steered the ship onto the treacherous Goodwin Sands, killing everyone aboard. A subsequent inquiry into the disaster recorded a verdict of misadventure.|$|R
30|$|The {{clearance}} matching of chainless haulage {{system with}} a pitch of 147  mm was studied. First of all, the variable range of meshing central distance of the shearer walk wheel and scraper conveyor <b>pin</b> <b>rail</b> was determined. Its determination principles are: under the correct meshing situation, the minimum meshing central distance can warrant the no interference and no gear jam between walk wheel and <b>pin</b> <b>rail</b> (two section pin row connection), and it is usually approximately 10  mm less than the pitch radius of the walk wheel; the maximum meshing central distance must satisfy the rational meshing, the simulation shows that the increase of the meshing central distance has little effect, based on analysis and experience, the value is taken as 15  mm larger than the corresponding pitch radius of the walk wheel; a further increase of meshing central distance would cause: imprecise rolling, impact on gears from every contact and alteration, the wear of wheel gear and rack gear, etc.|$|E
5000|$|The {{construction}} {{method was}} to lay [...] "parallel lines of mud sills (ballast), {{eight or ten}} inches square, under where the rails would come", in places {{that did not have}} a firm foundation. On top of these sills were laid 4-by-6-inch or 4-by-8-inch oak [...] "stringers" [...] notched and <b>pinned</b> together. The <b>rails</b> were flat iron straps (section of rail) 12 to 15 feet long, two-and-a-half inches wide, and only five-eighths of an inch thick. Spikes held them onto the stringers, and their ends were mitered. As the rails were used, these ends often curled up, causing damage (snakeheads) to the undercarriages of the cars and serious injury or death to unlucky passengers.|$|R
5000|$|Super Saver {{started the}} day as the second {{favorite}} behind Lookin At Lucky. Coming out of the No. 4 gate, Borel immediately broke towards the inside rail, a strategy he often employs. [...] He then pulled the horse back, rounding the final turn in fourth place, and charged to victory along the rail, holding off the impressive late charge from Ice Box on the sloppy track. It was the horse's first victory since winning the Kentucky Jockey Club Stakes as a two-year-old. Pre-race favorite Lookin At Lucky was hampered by drawing the No. 1 post. He was <b>pinned</b> on the <b>rail</b> early and did not get adequate running room {{until it was too}} late, finishing sixth.|$|R
5000|$|Heeding Bryant's advice, Palmer {{decided to}} route the {{railroad}} {{south of the}} canyon and in March 1883, it completed its connection to Salt Lake City and {{for a brief period}} the canyon was on the main line of a transcontinental railroad system. While the railroad and early visitors used the canyon as a path to Utah and mines to the southwest, later visitors came to see the canyon as an opportunity for recreation and personal enjoyment.Rudyard Kipling described his 1889 ride through the canyon in the following words: [...] "We entered a gorge, remote from the sun, where the rocks were two thousand feet sheer, and where a rock splintered river roared and howled ten feet below a track which seemed to have been built on the simple principle of dropping miscellaneous dirt into the river and <b>pinning</b> a few <b>rails</b> a-top.

40|$|Landslides {{are very}} common within the {{residual}} soils and sedimentary rock of Southern Indiana. A {{substantial amount of}} the Indiana State budget is spent on road repair and maintenance from damage caused by landslide. The landslide remedial technique frequently applied by the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) is the excavation and backfill method, which in most instances is successful. However, in many cases more liberal landslide treatments may be applied that would arrest movement, provide a sufficient safety factor, and at a lower cost. The objective {{of this study is}} to propose economically feasible landslide remedial methods that may be used as an alternative to the excavation and backfill method. “Unconventional” landslide remedial methods describe stabilization methods that are not commonly practiced in Indiana, and for which design criteria are not available. Unconventional stabilization methods will likely have the greatest benefit applied to relatively small landslides requiring constant maintenance because these landslides are in a delicate equilibrium. Relatively modest improvements in stability may be sufficient to stop persistent movements. Proposed landslide remedial methods are conventional horizontal drains, driven horizontal wick drains, driven recycled plastic <b>pins,</b> railroad <b>rail</b> piles, lime piles, biotechnical remediation, and gravity mass retaining systems. A landslide inventory containing various attribute information of geologic environment and landslide geometry was compiled. The inventory includes 284 landslides with attribute information of each individual landslide. Landslide locations were entered into a geographic information system (GIS) database along with geographic and geologic information. The constructed GIS database allowed easy correlation of landslide occurrence with geologic features. It is concluded that landslide occurrence is a function of topography and bedrock geology. Suitability of landslide stabilization methods depends upon the characteristics of the sliding mass, which include the geologic environment and geometry of the landslide. A landslide classification scheme was developed which recommends suitable remedial solutions based upon the landslide classification. Eleven landslide types are recognized by the classification scheme, which is based upon four landslide attributes...|$|R
60|$|After much dallying {{and more}} {{climbing}} {{we came to}} a pass like all the Bolan Passes in the world, and the Black Cañon of the Gunnison called they it. We had been climbing for very many hours, and attained a modest elevation of some seven or eight thousand feet above the sea, when we entered a gorge, remote from the sun, where the rocks were two thousand feet sheer, and where a rock-splintered river roared and howled ten feet below a track which seemed to have been built on the simple principle of dropping miscellaneous dirt into the river and <b>pinning</b> a few <b>rails</b> a-top. There was a glory and a wonder and a mystery about that mad ride which I felt keenly (you will find it properly dressed up in the guide-books), until I had to offer prayers {{for the safety of the}} train. There was no hope of seeing the track two hundred yards ahead. We seemed to be running into the bowels of the earth at the invitation of an irresponsible stream. Then the solid rock would open and disclose a curve of awful twistfulness. Then the driver put on all steam, and we would go round that curve on one wheel chiefly, the Gunnison River gnashing its teeth below. The cars overhung the edge of the water, and if a single one of the rails had chosen to spread, nothing in the wide world could have saved us from drowning. I knew we should damage something in the end--the sombre horrors of the gorge, the rush of the jade-green water below, and the cheerful tales told by the conductor made me certain of the catastrophe.|$|R
