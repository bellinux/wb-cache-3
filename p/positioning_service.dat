25|$|IRNSS is an {{independent}} regional navigation satellite system being developed by India. It {{is designed to provide}} accurate position information service to users in India as well as the region extending up to 1500km from its boundary, which is its primary service area. IRNSS will provide two types of services, namely, Standard <b>Positioning</b> <b>Service</b> (SPS) and Restricted Service (RS) and is expected to provide a position accuracy of better than 20m in the primary service area. It is an autonomous regional satellite navigation system being developed by Indian Space Research Organisation, which is under total control of Indian government. The requirement of such a navigation system is driven by the fact that access to Global Navigation Satellite Systems like GPS is not guaranteed in hostile situations. ISRO initially planned to launch the constellation of satellites between 2012 and 2014 but the project got delayed by nearly 2 years.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Position-based routing {{protocols}} make routing {{decisions based on}} the geographical position of the destination of a packet. Such protocols scale well since they do not require nodes to maintain explicit routes. Instead each node must know only its own position, the position of its neighbors, and {{the position of the}} destination. Thus, a critical component of position-based {{routing protocols}} is the <b>position</b> <b>service</b> that allows nodes to obtain the position of a destination node. In this paper we analyze the security vulnerabilities of positionbased routing protocols and virtual home region (VHR) -based distributed <b>position</b> <b>service</b> systems. We propose methods to protect the position information from both external and internal attackers. We then discuss and propose several mitigation mechanisms against position abuse by internal attackers that exploit the <b>position</b> <b>service</b> to trace their targets. Finally, we propose a position verification mechanism that allows the <b>position</b> <b>service</b> to verify that the positions reported by nodes are correct. I...|$|R

50|$|The user segment (US) is {{composed}} {{of hundreds of thousands}} of U.S. and allied military users of the secure GPS Precise <b>Positioning</b> <b>Service,</b> and tens of millions of civil, commercial and scientific users of the Standard <b>Positioning</b> <b>Service</b> (see GPS navigation devices). In general, GPS receivers are composed of an antenna, tuned to the frequencies transmitted by the satellites, receiver-processors, and a highly stable clock (often a crystal oscillator). They may also include a display for providing location and speed information to the user. A receiver is often described by its number of channels: this signifies how many satellites it can monitor simultaneously. Originally limited to four or five, this has progressively increased over the years so that, , receivers typically have between 12 and 20 channels. Though there are many receiver manufacturers, they almost all use one of the chipsets produced for this purpose.|$|E

40|$|The use and {{technologies}} surrounding mobile phones will {{increase in the}} future. An {{example of this is}} the mobile <b>positioning</b> <b>services.</b> While some people believe that these services will lead companies toward a brighter future, other regards them as a threat to employees’ privacy. This thesis focuses on how employees perceive the future mobile <b>positioning</b> <b>services</b> and how this new technology affects their privacy at work. For the theoretical part of the research Soft System Methodology, the concept of mobile positioning, and three aspects of privacy were used. To reach the aim qualitative interviews and quantitative questionnaires were carried out. The following conclusions were made from the theories and the empirical material. Employees believe that mobile <b>positioning</b> <b>services</b> affect their privacy. They admit that the new technology has both positive and negative affects. Furthermore, privacy is something personal and of importance at work. The study also shows that employees’ view of privacy can differ from the companies’ view. Finally, from the study a proposal evolved. It shows that involving employees in the introduction of mobile <b>positioning</b> <b>services</b> will diminish the threats of invading their privacy.

50|$|NAVIC signals {{will consist}} of a Standard <b>Positioning</b> <b>Service</b> and a Precision Service. Both will be carried on L5 (1176.45 MHz) and S band (2492.028 MHz). The SPS signal will be {{modulated}} by a 1 MHz BPSK signal. The Precision Service will use BOC(5,2). The navigation signals themselves would be transmitted in the S-band frequency (2-4 GHz) and broadcast through a phased array antenna to maintain required coverage and signal strength. The satellites would weigh approximately 1,330 kg and their solar panels generate 1,400 watts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Position-based ad hoc routing {{algorithms}} {{have proved}} to have decent performance in delivery ratio and endto-end delay. <b>Position</b> <b>service</b> is essential for such algorithms. In this paper, a distributed <b>position</b> <b>service</b> system, named VDPS, is proposed and evaluated. In the system, each node has a virtual home region (VHR), which is a geographic area. Nodes residing in a node’s VHR will act as its position servers. A node updates its position to the servers, through which other nodes can obtain its position. To reduce the overhead on position management and simplify the operation, in VDPS, a VHR is divided into subregions. A region-based broadcast is used for position update, and a sequential searching is used for position retrieving. Different mechanisms for improving system robustness have been proposed. Mathematical models are built for analyzing system robustness and control overhead. Illustrated results show that VDPS can maintain a high system robustness at a relatively low control overhead.

5000|$|Ground-Based Augmentation System (GBAS) (Local Area Augmentation System in the United States) is a safety-critical {{system that}} augments the GNSS Standard <b>Positioning</b> <b>Service</b> (SPS) and {{provides}} enhanced levels of service. It supports {{all phases of}} approach, landing, departure, and surface operations within the VHF coverage volume. GBAS is expected to {{play a key role}} in modernization and in all-weather operations capability at CATI/II and III airports, terminal area navigation, missed approach guidance and surface operations. GBAS provides the capability to service the entire airport with a single frequency (VHF transmission) whereas ILS requires a separate frequency for each runway end. GBAS CAT-I is seen as a necessary step towards the more stringent operations of CAT-II/III precision approach and landing. The technical risk of implementing GBAS delayed widespread acceptance of the technology. The FAA, along with industry, have fielded Provably Safe Prototype GBAS stations which mitigate the impact of satellite signal deformation, ionosphere differential error, ephemeris error, and multipath.|$|E
50|$|The {{system is}} {{intended}} to provide an absolute position accuracy of better than 10 meters throughout Indian landmass and better than 20 meters in the Indian Ocean {{as well as a}} region extending approximately 1500 km around India. The Space Applications Centre in 2017 said NAVIC will provide standard <b>positioning</b> <b>service</b> to all users with a position accuracy up to 5 m. The GPS, for comparison, had a position accuracy of 20-30 m. Unlike GPS which is dependent only on L-band, NAVIC has dual frequency (S and L bands). When low frequency signal travels through atmosphere, its velocity changes due to atmospheric disturbances. US banks on atmospheric model to assess frequency error and it has to update this model {{from time to time to}} assess the exact error. In India's case, the actual delay is assessed by measuring the difference in delay of dual frequency (S and L bands). Therefore, NavIC is not dependent on any model to find the frequency error and is more accurate than GPS.|$|E

40|$|RTK GNSS Networks {{for real}} time and {{post-processing}} <b>positioning</b> <b>services</b> {{are becoming more}} and more numerous throughout the world. In order to study the quality of the real time <b>positioning</b> <b>services</b> offered by these facilities with particular respect to outlier identification and rejection and accuracy assessment, classical statistical methods do not appear adequate. In fact, they are mainly based on Least Squares adjustment results and on the hypothesis of normally distributed samples: in addition, most outlier detection tests are set up for univariate samples. This paper presents a method based on the robust computation of Mahalanobis distances able to detect outliers in multivariate samples, and its evaluation by comparing the results obtained from randomly generated data with those stemming from other classical methods. The application of this method in the processing of RTK positions, recorded in real time with a GNSS receiver assisted by a RTK Network for <b>positioning</b> <b>services</b> is shown. In the various tests performed using both simulated samples and those from real GPS observations, the proposed method has been found effective for the outlier detection. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.
