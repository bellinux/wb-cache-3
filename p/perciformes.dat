To test this hypothesis, the hepatic transcriptomes in Barramundi, a <b>perciforme</b> teleost fish, (Lates calcarifer) from two reference sites, two agriculturally impacted sites sampled during the dry season, and an impacted site sampled during the wet season were compared. The hepatic transcriptome was profiled using RNA-Seq. Multivariate analysis showed that transcriptomes were clustered based on site and by inference water quality, but not sampling time. The largest differences in transcriptomic profile were between reference sites and a site sampled during high run-off, showing that impacted sites can be identified via RNA-Seq.

40|$|Like mammals, fish {{possess an}} {{interferon}} regulatory factor 3 (IRF 3) /IRF 7 -dependent type I IFN responses, but the exact {{mechanism by which}} IRF 3 /IRF 7 regulate the type I IFNs remains largely unknown. In this study, we identified two type I IFNs in the <b>Perciforme</b> fish large yellow croaker Larimichthys crocea, one of which belongs to the fish IFNd subgroup, {{and the other is}} assigned to a novel subgroup of group I IFNs in fish, tentatively termed IFNh. The two IFN genes are constitutively expressed in all examined tissues, but with varied expression levels. Both IFN genes can be rapidly induced in head kidney and spleen tissues by polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid. The recombinant IFNh was shown to be more potent to trigger a rapid induction of the antiviral genes MxA and PKR than the IFNd, suggesting that they may play distinct roles in regulating early antiviral immunity. Strikingly, IFNd, but not IFNh, could induce the gene expression of itself and IFNh through a positive feedback loop mediated by the IFNd-dependent activation of IRF 3 and IRF 7. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that the induction of IFNd can be enhanced by the dimeric formation of IRF 3 and IRF 7, while the IFNh expression mainly involves IRF 3. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the IFN responses are diverse in fish and are likely to be regulated by distinct mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Coastal {{ecosystems}} including tropical {{coral reefs}} are increasingly threatened by land based pollution {{which is now}} occurring simultaneously {{with an increase in}} ocean temperatures. Despite the high ecological and economical importance of these ecosystems, the impacts of pollutants and thermal stress on tropical marine organisms have only recently been considered and are usually studied in isolation to each other. In South-East Asia and North-Eastern Australia bordering the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), {{one of the most widely}} used insecticides is the organophosphate (OP) chlorpyrifos (CPF). In both regions, the wet season produces high rainfall and significant flood plumes transporting CPF onto inshore reefs at a time when reefs also experience high summer water temperatures. A few studies have shown that the damselfish Acanthochromis polyacanthus from the Indo-Pacific is sensitive to stress and this fish is becoming a model species in ecophysiology. Still, the underlying mechanisms leading to such sensitivity are largely unidentified. More importantly, very little is known about the effects of simultaneous stressors on reef fish generally. Consequently, this thesis aims to provide new insights into the neurophysiology, oxidative stress response and molecular stress response of a model tropical reef fish from the Indo-Pacific region, the damselfish Acanthochromis polyacanthus, after exposure to CPF and/or thermal stress under laboratory-controlled conditions. Juveniles of A. polyacanthus bred at James Cook University were exposed to a) CPF alone, b) temperature stress and c) simultaneous CPF and temperature stresses. Stress markers were used to examine different types of stress response. Activity of the neural enzyme Cholinesterase (ChE) was determined in muscle, as it is recognized as a sensitive indicator for OP exposure. Characterization of ChE was also undertaken to determine the predominant form of the enzyme in muscle tissue in this model reef fish species. To explore potential oxidative stress responses two key antioxidant molecules were examined. This included measurement of the ratio of the Coenzyme Q antioxidant form (CoQH₂) over total CoQ, as well as measurement of the activity of the detoxifying enzyme glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in liver tissue. Finally, expression of candidate stress-responsive genes (heat-shock protein 90, GST, Catalase, Elongation Factor 1 α) was examined to explore the molecular response to CPF exposure and thermal stress in A. polyacanthus. Prior to experimental CPF exposure, ChE characterization revealed the presence of a complex mixture of ChEs in A. polyacanthus muscle tissue. This mixture was comprised of an atypical vertebrate acetylcholinesterase (AChE) form, as well as a typical vertebrate AChE and an atypical vertebrate butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Reports in the literature of two other <b>Perciforme</b> species possessing similar ChEs and inhabiting coral reefs suggests evolutionary implications of atypical ChEs and raises the questions of their functional significance in coral reef fish.

40|$|Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) plays a {{key role}} in thermal {{adaptation}} across organisms, allowing alteration of membranes in response to temperature change. Thermal adaptive signatures at the gene sequence level and in the primary structure of the SCD protein require investigation, especially in Antarctic fish. Owing to the stenothermal nature of Antarctic fish, it remains unclear whether they have retained capacity to modulate their membranes in response to warming temperatures. The hypothesis that membrane saturation, a major thermal adaptive mechanism, will occur at reduced capacities in Antarctic notothenioid fish in response to elevated temperatures was tested SCD sequences were isolated from 21 fish species (Antarctic and non-Antarctic notothenioids, and non-notothenioid Antarctic fish species). Phylogenetic analyses supported the ancestral SCD 1 duplication into SCD 1 a and SCD 1 b. Lineage-specific duplication and loss of gene duplicates were identified for specific orders of fish. Cold adapted notothenioids (Antarctic and non-Antarctic with Antarctic ancestry) SCD isoform sequences were evolutionarily distinct from non-Antarctic sequences. SCD 1 a and 1 b from Antarctic fish displayed more diversity with amino acid composition varying across the isoforms. SCD 1 a isoforms had more sites under positive selection and a higher rate of molecular evolution in Antarctic fish than SCD 1 b, suggesting neofunctionalisation of SCD 1 a. Ubiquitous tissue expression of SCD 1 b was seen in both the Antarctic species Trematomus bernacchii and Pagothenia borchgrevinki, while ubiquitous expression of SCD 1 a isoform was seen in T. bernacchii but not in P. borchgrevinki. Transcriptional response of the SCD isoforms, along with the biochemical response of membrane saturation, in T. bernacchii and P. borchgrevinki livers were determined in fish acclimated at 0 °C (control temperature), 4 °C and 6 °C. Overall, temperature had a significant effect on the expression of SCD 1 a and SCD 1 b in T. bernacchii, while expression of SCD 1 a was low to be detected by qPCR in P. borchgrevinki. Membrane lipid composition of Antarctic fish species varied significantly when compared to the New Zealand <b>Perciforme</b> species Notolabrus celidotus. Thermal acclimation at 4 °C did not result in any detectable change in membrane saturation state or membrane cholesterol in either Antarctic species. However, 6 °C thermal acclimation induced a homeoviscous adaptive (HVA) response in the benthic species T. bernacchii, as shown by the significant increase in membrane saturated fatty acids, and a significant decline in unsaturated fatty acids. HVA response was not observed in P. borchgrevinki. This is the first study to determine thermal adaptive signatures in the SCD gene of Antarctic fish and provides evidence for asymmetric molecular evolution of SCD. This provides a framework for future functional work. This is also the first study to show a homeoviscous response to higher temperature in an Antarctic fish although only for one of the two species examined...|$|R

40|$|The use of wrasse (Pisces: Labridae) as {{cleaner fish}} to combat infections with the {{parasitic}} copepods Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Kroyer) and Caligus elongatus (Nordmann) (sea-lice) {{in the culture}} of Salmo salar L. (Atlantic salmon) is now common. Infections with these parasites has caused considerable losses in the industry since its formative years. The use of the wrasse species Ctenolabrus rupestris (L.) (goldsinny), Centrolabrus exoletus (L.) (rockcook), Symphodus melops (= Crenilabrus melops) (L.) (corkwing) and Labrus mixtus L. (cuckoo) as cleaner fish was first suggested in 1988. The use of these species in the industry is now widespread in Scotland, Ireland and Norway. The fish used are normally caught from the wild before being stocked with S. salar smolts during their first year at sea. The fish are routinely collected from waters close to the farm sites to be stocked. As most of the S. salar sea production sites in Scotland are located on the west coast of the country, the wrasse to be used in these sites are normally collected from these waters. The movement of wild fish into farm pens presents a risk of disease transfer from wrasse to S. salar and vice versa. Prior to their use as cleaner fish, these four species of wrasse had received little attention as subjects of scientific study. As a result, there was very little information available in the literature regarding their diseases. The present study was undertaken to investigate the potential pathogens present in wild populations in Scottish coastal waters, and, in particular, which of these pathogens, if any, could be transmitted to the S. salar. The study also investigated the susceptibility of wrasse to the two major viral diseases of S. salar to which they would be exposed in pens. In order to fully assess the pathogenicity of the potential disease agents under farm conditions, it was first necessary to establish the normal morphology of the wrasse species. Hence, a study of the morphological features of wrasse, with particular emphasis on those features important in the health of the fish was undertaken. Wrasse were shown to differ in many aspects from salmonids but shared many morphological features with other <b>perciforme</b> fish. Major differences from salmonids were evident in the skin, fins, pancreas, intestine, gonads and heart. There were also aspects of their morphology which differed from other <b>perciforme</b> fish, notably the structure of the heart. These features were regarded to be adaptations to the specific demands of their feeding strategies and habitats. This study was {{the first of its kind}} undertaken for wrasse and showed some early contraindications for the use of wrasse in culture; most notable was the marked lipid accumulation in, and resultant degeneration of, the liver resulting from the consumption of high energy S. salar feeds. Once the normal morphological features were established, it was possible to examine the disease status of wrasse. Wild fish were sampled from three different locations on the west coast of Scotland. These sites were all geographically distinct and were all used as sources of wrasse for the S. salar farming industry. Samples of wrasse were also obtained from farm sites supplied with wrasse from these wild sites, and an additional number of other geographically distinct farm locations. As a comparison wrasse were also obtained from a wrasse captive breeding facility and another captive location unrelated to the S. salar industry, a public aquarium. The fish from all of these sampling sites were examined fully for the presence of parasites, bacteria and, in some cases, viruses. Histological examination was also carried out on all of the fish studied. A total of 24 new parasite host records, and two tentative ones, were recorded from the four wrasse species studied. These new parasite records included protozoa, digeneans, nematodes and crustacea. Parasite infections were found to vary in prevalence, abundance and intensity in respect to the geographical characteristics of sampling sites and also the length of time spent in S. salar pens. It was concluded that the separation of wrasse from their natural diet and habitat influenced the degree of parasitism. None of the parasites found to infect wrasse were observed to cause any significant pathology in their hosts other than localised tissue responses. The possibility of transfer of wrasse parasites to S. salar was also investigated experimentally in a series of infections in which parasites dissected from wrasse were introduced to S. salar smolts by means of a novel gavage method. None of the parasites used established in the S. salar, indicating that there is little risk of transfaunation of parasites between wrasse and S. salar. However, this aspect requires further work due to the low number of parasites available and the subsequent low numbers of S. salar infected. Bacterial isolates were obtained from wrasse held in S. salar pens but were not found in any of the fish collected from the wild. Most of the bacterial strains isolated would normally be considered as opportunistic pathogens of fish. It was concluded that the relatively high levels of stress, both environmental and physical, that wrasse are subjected to under farm conditions were instrumental in the number of bacterial infections seen in wrasse. Only one pathogenic bacterial infection was seen in any of the fish sampled. This was an isolate of Aeromonas salmonicida, the agent known to cause the disease furunculosis, isolated from a wrasse obtained from one of the farm samples. Other authors have reported that this bacterium has already caused substantial losses of wrasse under farm conditions. It was concluded that Aeromonas salmonicida will prove to be a major pathogen of wrasse held in S. salar pens. No viruses wereI isolated from any of the wrasse studied. The susceptibility of wrasse to the most significant pathogens of S. salar under farm conditions was also subjected to investigation. In addition to sea-lice infection, the industry lists Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis (IPN) and Pancreas Disease (PD) as of primary importance for further research. Both of these diseases cause substantial losses in the industry. The susceptibility of wrasse to both of these disease conditions was investigated by means of experimental infections. In the case of IPN wrasse were infected by bathing with two different infective doses, a low dose which would be expected to induce the disease in S. salar parr and a second dose substantially higher than the first. The C. rupestris used were found to be susceptible to IPN. The wrasse developed some of the pathological characteristics typical of the disease in S. salar, however, other pathological signs were peculiar to wrasse. The recovery rate from the disease seen in wrasse was far more rapid than that recorded from S. salar. Shedding of the virus in the faeces of infected C. rupestris was also demonstrated. This study has illustrated for the first time the susceptibility of wrasse to IPN and that they can shed the virus in their faeces. This suggests that infected wrasse could be a source of continual reinfection in an affected sea site. Experimental infections of C. rupestris with PD followed a standard protocol for the reproduction of the disease in S. salar. Infection was by means of intraperitoneal injection with putatively infective material obtained from S. salar affected with PD. Two infection doses were used, the lowest dose used had been proven to be effective in inducing the disease in S. salar parr while the second dose, ten times higher than the first, had been shown to be effective in reproducing PD in S. salar smolts. The C. rupestris infected did not develop any of the typical signs of the disease seen in S. salar. It was, therefore, concluded that wrasse were not susceptible to PD. The implications of the findings of the study on the continual use of wrasse in the production of S. salar is discussed and suggestions for further research are made...|$|R

25|$|The Sillaginidae, {{commonly}} known as the smelt-whitings, whitings, sillaginids, sand borers and sand-smelts, are a family of benthic coastal marine fish in the order <b>Perciformes.</b> The smelt-whitings inhabit a wide region covering much of the Indo-Pacific, from the west coast of Africa east to Japan and south to Australia. The family comprises only five genera and 35 species, of which a number are dubious, with the last major revision of the family in 1992 unable to confirm the validity of a number of species. They are elongated, slightly compressed fish, often light brown to silver in colour, with a variety of markings and patterns on their upper bodies. The Sillaginidae are not related to a number of fishes commonly called 'whiting' in the Northern Hemisphere, including the fish originally called whiting, Merlangius merlangus.|$|E
25|$|The Sillaginidae are {{medium-sized}} fishes which grow to {{an average}} of around 20cm and around 100 g, although the largest member of the family, the King George whiting is known to reach 72cm and 4.8kg in weight. The body shape and fin placement of the family is quite similar to most {{of the members of the}} order <b>Perciformes.</b> Their bodies are elongate, slightly compressed, with a head that tapers toward a terminal mouth. The mouth has a band of brush-like teeth with canine teeth present only in the upper jaw of Sillaginopsis. The cranial sensory system of the family is well developed above and laterally, with the lower jaw having a pair of small pores behind which is a median pit containing a pore on each side. On each side of the elongate head the operculum has a short sharp spine. They have two true dorsal fins; the anterior one supported by 10 to 13 spines while the long rear one is held up by a single leading spine followed by 16 to 27 soft rays. The anal fin is similar to the second dorsal fin, having two small slender spines followed by 14 to 26 soft rays. Their bodies are covered in ctenoid scales, with the exception of the cheek which may have cycloid or ctenoid scales. There is a wide variation in the amount of lateral line scales, ranging from 50 to 141. The swimbladder in the Sillaginidae is either absent, poorly developed, or highly complex with anterior and lateral extensions that project well into the caudal region. A unique duct-like process is present from the ventral surface of the swimbladder to just before the urogenital opening in most species. The presence and morphology of each species' swim bladder is often their major diagnostic feature, with McKay's three proposed subgenera based on swimbladder morphology alone. The sillaginids have only a small range of body colourings and frequently the only colour characteristics to identify between species are the arrangements of spots and bars on their upper bodies. Most of the family are a pale brown – creamy white colour, while a few species are silver all over. The undersides of the fish are usually lighter than the upper side, and the fins range from yellow to transparent, often marked by bars and spots.|$|E

No other order has more than four species in the river and one endemic.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationships}} of the Sillaginidae are poorly known, with very similar morphological characteristics {{and a lack}} of genetic studies restricting the ability to perform cladistic analyses on the family. Being the fossil sillaginids are based on the comparison of fossil otoliths, with no other type of remains found thus far, this also prevents the reconstruction of the evolution of the family through fossil species. While the position of the Sillaginidae in the order <b>Perciformes</b> is firmly established due to a number of synapomorphies shared {{with other members of the}} order, no sister group has been established for the family. The current taxonomic status of the family is thought to represent a basic picture of the group's phylogeny, with McKay further dividing the genus Sillago into three subgenera based on shared morphological characters of the swimbladder. The genera Sillaginodes and Sillaginopsis have the most plesiomorphic characteristics; being monotypic, and distinct from Sillago. Sillago is further divided into three subgenera based primarily on swim bladder morphology; Sillago, Parasillago and Sillaginopodys, which also [...] represent evolutionary relationships. Whilst genetic studies have not been done on the family, they have been used to establish the relationship of what were thought to be various subspecies of school whiting, S. bassensis and S. flindersi. Furthermore, morphological data suggests a number of Australian species diverged very recently during the last glacial maximum, which caused land bridges to isolate populations of fish. The two aforementioned species of school whiting, S. maculata and S. burrus, and S. ciliata and S. analis are all thought to be products of such a process, although only the school whiting have anything other than similar morphology as evidence of this process.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Perciformes,</b> {{also called}} the Percomorpha or Acanthopteri, are the most {{numerous}} order of vertebrates, containing about 41% of all bony fish. <b>Perciformes</b> means [...] "perch-like". They belong to the class of ray-finned fish, and comprise over 10,000 species found in almost all aquatic ecosystems.|$|E
