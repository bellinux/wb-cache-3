From early pre-Hispanic times, this valley was an {{important}} settlement area for a number of ethnic groups, whose economic and cultural development was strongly influenced by the natural resources that existed here. The Valley of Toluca was also an important gateway to the tropical lowlands to the south and west. Trade routes through the valley brought valued commodities such as salt, tropical fruits, semiprecious stones and ocean products such as shells. Later, after the conquest of the valley by the Aztec Empire, it became an important <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> for tribute goods coming to the capital of Tenochtitlan. It was also important as a staging area for the regular wars between the Aztecs and the Purépecha (in what is now Michoacán) as possession of much of the western valley was in dispute.|$|E

It was recommended for immediate production, even before it began combat trials in November 1942. All three aircraft were assigned to the 728th Fighter Aviation Regiment of the 3rd Air Army of the Kalinin Front and were tightly controlled to prevent the loss of the prototypes. For example, all sorties had to be flown over Soviet-controlled territory and required the express permission of the 3rd Air Army staff to fly. Pilots' reports were quite enthusiastic; the 728th's commander, Captain Vasilyaka wrote: [...] "The I-185 outclasses both Soviet and foreign aircraft in level speed. It performs aerobatic maneuvers easily, rapidly and vigorously. The I-185 is the best current fighter from the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> simplicity, speed, maneuverability (especially in climb), armament and survivability." ...|$|E

Roman coins, dating from the time of Domitian to Constantine the Great, were contained in a crock found during the 19th century. Other finds include a vessel containing 338 sestertii, which were given to the Museum of Somerset in 1915 by W. R. Phelps, and two other similar pots of coins that together contained slightly over 1,000 coins from Republican Rome to the time of Postumus, which must have been buried at some time after 260. Damaged bronze scales of lorica squamata, a type of scale armour, have also been found.|$|E

5000|$|Intervention {{strategies}} and techniques for Bobath consist of therapeutic handling, facilitation, and activation <b>of</b> key <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> Therapeutic handling {{is used in}} order to influence {{the quality of the}} patients movements and incorporates both facilitation and inhibition. [...] Facilitation is a key technique used by Bobath practitioners to promote motor learning. It is the use of sensory information (tactile cue through manual contacts, verbal directions) to reinforce weak movement patterns and to discourage overactive ones. The appropriate provision of facilitation during the motor task is regulated in time, modality, intensity and withdrawal, all of which affects the outcome of motor learning. [...] Inhibition can be described as reducing parts of movement/posture that are abnormal and interfere with normal performance. Key <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> generally refers to parts of the body that are advantageous when facilitating or inhibiting movement/posture.|$|R

40|$|Introduction The {{internet}} {{defies the}} classic state law model, {{according to which}} the sovereign state makes and enforces the law on its territory, including {{by the use of}} force (Frydman, 1997; Svantesson, 2005). The required bond between state sovereignty, national territory and law is loose when dealing with internet regulation. In addition, international law does not answer the question of which court(s) should have jurisdiction over internet litigation and what law(s) should be applied (Berman, 2002; Svantesson, 2005). In other words, the internet engages regulators to use new methods of drafting and implementing legal rules. Co-regulation is one of the techniques that can be used. Despite the fact that defining “co-regulation” remains challenging and unsettled (Poullet, 2004; Lievens, Dumortier and Ryan, 2006; Hennebel and Lewkowicz, 2007), a theoretical sketch of what the co-regulation model entails can be produced. For analytical purposes, it is convenient to make a distinction between regulators and what Jonathan Zittrain (2003) calls “points <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> ” Regulators are public or private bodies willing to influence the behaviors of actors in a field <b>of</b> action. <b>Points</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> are any public or private actors that, for any reason, play a strategic role in a particular area. Regarding internet regulation, the method used by regulators consists in leaning on these <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> as regulatory levers. The so-called “co-regulatory mechanism” must be understood in this chapter as a legal device designed to put pressure on the <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> to achieve some regulatory result.

40|$|Fundamental to the {{development}} of musical or artis-tic creative work is the ability to transform raw materi-als. This ability implies the facility to master many facets of the material, and to shape it with plasticity. Computer music environments typically provide <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> to manipulate material by supplying parameters with con-trollable values. This capability to <b>control</b> the values <b>of</b> parameters is inadequate for many artistic endeavors, and does not reflect the analogous tools and methods of artists working with physical materials. Rather than viewing parameters in computer-based systems as single <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> the authors posit that parameters must become more multifaceted and dynamic in order to serve the needs of artists. The authors propose an expanded notion of how to work with parameters in computer-centric environments for time-based art. A pro-posed partial solution to this problem is to give parameters additional properties that define their behavior. An exam-ple implementation of these ideas is presented in Jamoma. 1...|$|R
