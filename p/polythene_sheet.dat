40|$|Abstract. Concrete {{performance}} is severely influenced when placed in extreme environmental conditions and hence certain measures {{are required to}} control it. The present paper proposes covering the structural members with colored <b>polythene</b> <b>sheets</b> which serves dual purpose of curing. <b>Polythene</b> <b>sheets</b> do not allow appreciable loss of water by evaporation and thus they do not delay or prevent hydration besides providing optimum temperature and humidity conditions for strength development and being water conservative. In present study concrete cubes were wrapped using five different colored <b>polythene</b> <b>sheets</b> {{for a period of}} 7 -days. The study incorporates prevailing environmental conditions by relating effect of curing, including conventional methods like sprinkling and ponding on compressive strength of concrete at varied atmospheric temperatures, relative humidity and influence of available solar radiation. Significant compressive strength characteristics like initial tangent modulus and strain at peak stress are also determined for cubes at a period of 7 -, 28 -, and 180 -days. The quality assessment of concrete cubes cast was carried out using ultrasonic pulse velocity test results. The study aims at developing a knowledge base to design an extensive decision making algorithm that identifies appropriate curing method in prevailing environmental conditions...|$|R

50|$|Fences tend to {{fall into}} three basic categories, {{temporary}} (less than two years lifespan), semi-permanent (two to five years lifespan) and permanent (greater than two years lifespan). The materials used to construct them tend to vary with {{the length of time}} the fence is to remain operable. A temporary fence is normally constructed from UV-stabilised <b>polythene</b> <b>sheet</b> or woven geotextile. Semi-permanent fences are usually constructed from 1mm thick plastic panels. Permanent fences are usually constructed from rigid plastic or galvanised steel panels. In the case of temporary fencing materials, the underground return is created by folding the material at a &deg; angle along the base of the trench, and the top overhang by rolling the top edge of the membrane over a number of times to create a roll. For permanent fencing, the underground return is sometimes omitted and instead the fence is buried deeper (usually 300 mm). The top overhang is created by making a fold in the material at the manufacturing stage.|$|E

Presently, sustainability in concrete is being achieved by several techniques including partial replacement of cement with supplementary cementitious materials like fly ash. These high-volume fly ash mixtures incite meticulous study of curing method followed. It would be also be of substantial significance to seek for an environmentally sustainable curing method that works equally well for conventional concrete mixtures and fly ash mixtures.

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{effective}} ways to prevent damage from occurring to taxidermy collections is to establish a monitoring system or procedure that routinely checks the condition of specimens. When not on display, taxidermy specimens should be housed in well-sealed cabinets or cases. Metal cabinets may be made of aluminum and/or stainless steel with an epoxy powder coating and are effective at preventing pest and light damage. Wood cabinets can provide better protection from fluctuations in relative humidity, though they off-gas chemicals that may damage collections. Though it is essential for cabinets and cases to be well-sealed, they should also allow for minimal airflow to prevent off-gassed chemicals or humidity from building up inside the container. For taxidermy specimens housed on open shelving, a <b>polythene</b> <b>sheet</b> can provide temporary protection from pollutants, though dust may accumulate electrostatically (2).Controlled lighting conditions with UV filters are important for reducing fading in taxidermy specimens. Specimens should be regularly rotated in order to reduce light damage. 50-100 lux is the recommended light exposure for taxidermy, though some types of feathers are susceptible to damage at 50 lux. The maximum annual exposure levels for biological specimens, feathers, fur, and leather is 180,000 lux hours. In the span of one year, a taxidermy mount will fade half as much if displayed in low light compared to the same conditions in high light. Ideal relative humidity conditions for taxidermy specimens are 40% minimum and 55% maximum. An integrated pest management system is important to manage and monitor pests that can damage collections.|$|E

Cellulosic combustible solid wastes like cotton, paper etc. are treated by incineration and the plastic wastes are volume reduced by baling. Compaction of plastic wastes by baling gives low volume reduction factors (3 – 5) and also the resultant waste bale may spring back to original volume after disposal. With a view to achieve higher volume reduction factors, studies were conducted at CWMF on the melt-densification of plastic wastes at 180 - 190 C. The melted plastics were characterized by TGA/DTA & IR Spectroscopy and {{found that there was}} no structural loss of the polymer compounds. The melted mass was observed to have the expected theoretical density.
