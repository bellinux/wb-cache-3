50|$|And yet, {{it remains}} hidden and {{socially}} condoned. Widely {{perceived as a}} social taboo or a needed form of discipline, it is seldom reported; official statistics remain limited {{in their ability to}} capture the true scale and extent of this phenomenon; and, openly or implicitly, children feel pressed to conceal incidents of violence and abuse, particularly when perpetrated by people they know and trust. A culture of silence, secrecy and social indifference surrounds this phenomenon, paving the way to pervasive impunity. Violence hampers children’s development and leaves a long lasting impact. But, as confirmed by many successful initiatives promoted in all regions of the world, violence is not inevitable; it can be <b>prevented</b> <b>and</b> <b>effectively</b> <b>addressed.</b>|$|R

Health-EDRM provides an effective policy framework to unite diverse stakeholders to comprehensively <b>and</b> <b>effectively</b> <b>address</b> this complex field, from strengthening health and DRR efforts to building health resilience across populations. Health-EDRM is therefore multidisciplinary, multisectoral, and collaborative in nature (WHO 2011), and recognizes the holistic approach required to reduce the negative health outcomes from all hazards.|$|R

In the United States, the National Alzheimer's Project Act, signed into law in 2011, required the creation of such a plan with annual updates thereafter. Pursuant to this, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease in 2012, including an ambitious research goal of <b>preventing</b> <b>and</b> <b>effectively</b> treating Alzheimer's disease by 2025. To guide investments, activities, and the measurement of progress toward achieving this 2025 goal, in its first annual plan update (2013) HHS also incorporated into the plan a set of short, medium and long-term milestones. HHS further committed to updating these milestones on an ongoing basis to account for progress and setbacks, and emerging opportunities and obstacles. To assist HHS as it updates these milestones, the Alzheimer's Association convened a National Plan Milestone Workgroup consisting of scientific experts representing all areas of Alzheimer's and dementia research. The workgroup evaluated each milestone and made recommendations to ensure that they collectively constitute an adequate work plan for reaching the goal of <b>preventing</b> <b>and</b> <b>effectively</b> treating Alzheimer's by 2025.
