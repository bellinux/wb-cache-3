5|$|Another {{example is}} the Great Vowel Shift in English, which {{is the reason that}} the {{spelling}} of English vowels do not correspond well to their current <b>pronunciation.</b> This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with <b>pronunciation.</b> Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as <b>pronunciation</b> gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. This kind of change caused Latin mea domina to eventually become the French madame and American English ma'am.|$|E
5|$|Diacritics {{are used}} for phonetic detail. They are added to IPA letters to {{indicate}} a modification or specification of that letter's normal <b>pronunciation.</b>|$|E

40|$|Obtaining good <b>pronunciations</b> for named-entities poses a {{challenge}} for automated speech recognition because named-entities are diverse in nature and origin, and new entities come up every day. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of learning named-entity <b>pronunciations</b> using crowd-sourcing. By collecting audio samples from non-linguistic-expert speak-ers with Mechanical Turk and learning from them, we can quickly derive <b>pronunciations</b> that are more accurate in speech recognition tests than manual <b>pronunciations</b> generated by lin-guistic experts. Compared to traditional approaches of generat-ing <b>pronunciations,</b> this new approach proves to be cheap, fast, and quite accurate. 1...|$|R
5|$|Dialectologists {{identify}} many English dialects, {{which usually}} refer to regional varieties {{that differ from}} each other in terms of patterns of grammar, vocabulary, and <b>pronunciation.</b> The <b>pronunciation</b> of particular areas distinguishes dialects as separate regional accents. The major native dialects of English are often divided by linguists into the two extremely general categories of British English (BrE) and North American English (NAE). There also exists a third common major grouping of English varieties: Southern Hemisphere English, the most prominent being Australian and New Zealand English.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{words have}} {{irregular}} <b>pronunciations,</b> e.g. from non-standard dialects (salmon) or spelling <b>pronunciations</b> (falcon in American English).|$|R
50|$|Generally speaking, colloquial {{readings}} preserve more {{ancient and}} conservative <b>pronunciations,</b> while literary readings represent newer <b>pronunciations</b> {{influenced by the}} dialects of historical capital areas such as Nanjing or Beijing. The case is reversed in Mandarin Chinese, however, where literary <b>pronunciations</b> are usually older.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Pronunciations</b> given are {{the most}} Anglicized. More Latinate <b>pronunciations</b> are also common, {{particularly}} [...] rather than [...] for stressed a.|$|R
5|$|In RP, {{the lateral}} approximant , has two main allophones (<b>pronunciation</b> variants): the clear or plain , as in light, {{and the dark}} or velarised , as in full. GA has dark l in most cases.|$|E
5|$|Ottawa {{is one of}} the Ojibwe dialects {{that has}} {{undergone}} the most language change, although it shares many features with other dialects. The most distinctive change is a pervasive pattern of vowel syncope that deletes short vowels in many words, resulting in significant changes in their <b>pronunciation.</b> This and other innovations in <b>pronunciation,</b> in addition to changes in word structure and vocabulary, differentiate Ottawa from other dialects of Ojibwe.|$|E
5|$|Synthesized speech {{engines are}} {{available}} in many languages, and the engine's parameters, such as speech rate, pitch range, gender, stress patterns, pauses, and <b>pronunciation</b> exceptions can be manipulated by the user.|$|E
5000|$|... † In Zhangzhou and Amoy Hokkien {{variants}} of Southern Min, the traditional rising tone with former voiced obstruent onset has become tone [...] in literary reading <b>pronunciations</b> but tone [...] in colloquial <b>pronunciations.</b> In the Quanzhou variant of Southern Min, {{it is the}} sonorants that were voiced and in the rising tone in Middle Chinese that have split. In literary <b>pronunciations</b> they have merged into tone , but they have become tone [...] in colloquial <b>pronunciations.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>pronunciations</b> of syllabic [...] (ऋ), [...] (लृ) {{and their}} long {{counterparts}} no longer retained their pure <b>pronunciations,</b> but {{had started to}} be pronounced as short and long [...] (रि) and [...] (ल्रि).

25|$|Thus Middle Chinese {{has been}} reconstructed by Karlgren and later {{scholars}} by comparing these categories with Sino-Xenic <b>pronunciations</b> and <b>pronunciations</b> in modern varieties of Chinese.|$|R
5|$|The Coatbridge accent {{has been}} {{categorised}} as making less {{use of the}} Scots tongue and exhibiting a tendency to stress the 'a' vowel differently from general Scots usage. Examples of this are seen the <b>pronunciation</b> of the words stair (sterr), hair (herr), fair (ferr) and chair (cherr). This different enunciation {{has been attributed to}} the impact of successive influxes of Ulster Catholic immigrants into Coatbridge. However, the distinctiveness of the Coatbridge accent and <b>pronunciation</b> has diminished as the various surrounding populations (especially Glasgow) have mingled with that of Coatbridge.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} {{of this system}} with the rigid meter, and the stress patterns this implies, provides enough information to reconstruct his <b>pronunciation</b> with some precision; making the reasonable assumption that Orm's <b>pronunciation</b> {{was in no way}} unusual, this permits scholars of history of English to develop an exceptionally precise snapshot of exactly how Middle English was pronounced in the Midlands {{in the second half of}} the twelfth century (Matthew 2004, p.936).|$|E

50|$|As these {{examples}} show, because English alphaphonemics deviate significantly from Latinate <b>pronunciations,</b> the correspondence of English word spellings with their correct English <b>pronunciations</b> are not intuitively obvious to a learner.|$|R
5|$|The <b>pronunciation</b> of vowels varies a {{great deal}} between dialects {{and is one of}} the most {{detectable}} aspects of a speaker's accent. The table below lists the vowel phonemes in Received <b>Pronunciation</b> (RP) and General American (GA), with examples of words in which they occur from lexical sets compiled by linguists. The vowels are represented with symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet; those given for RP are standard in British dictionaries and other publications.|$|E
5|$|Variability in the <b>pronunciation</b> {{of words}} that contain vowels subject to syncope, as {{speakers}} frequently {{have more than one}} way of pronouncing them.|$|E
5|$|While a phoneme can be {{represented}} {{by more than one}} grapheme, each grapheme can be pronounced in only one way. This means that the actual <b>pronunciation</b> of a word is always clear from its orthographic form.|$|E
50|$|English distinguishes {{two types}} of stops: voiceless and voiced. Voiceless stops have three main <b>pronunciations</b> (allophones): {{moderately}} aspirated {{at the beginning of}} a word before a vowel, unaspirated after , and unaspirated, unreleased, glottalized, or debuccalized at the end of a word. English voiced stops are often only partially voiced. Thus, some <b>pronunciations</b> of the English stops are similar to the <b>pronunciations</b> of Ancient Greek stops.|$|R
40|$|In a 10 -day training, the {{efficacy}} of spelling <b>pronunciations</b> on German speaking 5 th-graders' spelling skills for irregular words was examined. Poor spellers were less efficient in learning the spelling <b>pronunciations</b> than age-adequate spellers. On post-tests, 1 week after the last training day and between 5 and 12 weeks after post-test 1, poor and age-adequate spellers spelled significantly more words correctly than matched control groups that received a comparable training without spelling <b>pronunciations.</b> Thus, spelling <b>pronunciations</b> provide an efficient means for the build-up of stable, phonologically underpinned orthographic representations for irregular word spellings. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

5|$|While the Tiberian, Babylonian, and Palestinian reading {{traditions are}} extinct, various other systems of <b>pronunciation</b> have evolved over time, notably the Yemenite, Sephardi, Ashkenazi, and Samaritan traditions. Modern Hebrew <b>pronunciation</b> {{is also used}} by some to read biblical texts. The modern reading traditions do not stem solely from the Tiberian system; for instance, the Sephardic tradition's {{distinction}} between qamatz gadol and qatan is pre-Tiberian. However, the only orthographic system used to mark vowels is the Tiberian vocalization.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} of Virginia, Newport News is most often {{associated}} with the larger American South. People who {{have grown up in}} the Hampton Roads area have a unique Tidewater accent which sounds different from a stereotypical Southern accent. Vowels have a longer <b>pronunciation</b> than in a typical southern accent.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} FreeBSD's logo was the generic BSD daemon, also called Beastie, a {{distorted}} <b>pronunciation</b> of BSD. First appearing in 1976 on Unix T-shirts purchased by Bell Labs, {{the more popular}} versions of the BSD daemon were drawn by animation director John Lasseter beginning in 1984.
