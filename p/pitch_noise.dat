2500|$|One commentator, after {{travelling}} on an Air France Viscount, {{wrote in}} 1953: [...] "Noise level {{was less than}} that of piston engines. It was a definite relief to be rid of the rough vibrations... The turboprop is an excellent shorthaul airplane and a definite crowd pleaser. The substitution of a lower constant <b>pitch</b> <b>noise</b> and smoothness for the vibration, grunts, and groans of the piston engine gives the hesitant passenger a feeling of confidence." [...] The Viscount's cabin windows were ellipses measuring 19 by 26 inches. The Viscount had lower operational costs than many rival aircraft; Vickers projected a 700 could carry a 13,000-lb payload from Chicago to New York in 2 hours 45 minutes against a 10-mph headwind, burning 6395lb of fuel.|$|E
50|$|Also, when {{compared}} to other home computers of the time, the Amstrad via Locomotive BASIC granted a relatively high level of control over the CPC sound chip an AY-3-8912 with 3 melodic channels and 1 noise channel. The same chip was also used on late-model ZX Spectrums, as well as the Atari ST and MSX computers, but none of those had such a complete built-in SOUND command. Many things, from selecting a particular channel or a combination of channels, setting envelopes, volume, <b>pitch,</b> <b>noise,</b> and so on could be done with a single SOUND command, with up to 7 parameters. Granted, especially complex and/or low-level techniques could not be done with BASIC due to their requiring more precise or direct access to the hardware, e.g. especially complex music from trackers (including simulated chords using arpeggios, etc.), the playback of digitally sampled sounds as in the game RoboCop for example, and so on.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms {{are caused}} by {{vascular}} compression of the airway, esophagus or both. Presentation is often within the first month (neonatal period) and usually within the first 6 months of life. Starting at birth an inspiratory and expiratory stridor (high <b>pitch</b> <b>noise</b> from turbulent airflow in trachea) may be present often in combination with an expiratory wheeze. The severity of the stridor may depend on the patient’s body position. It can be worse when the baby is {{lying on his back}} rather than its side. Sometimes the stridor can be relieved by extending the neck (lifting the chin up). Parents may notice that the baby’s cry is hoarse and the breathing noisy. Frequently a persistent cough is present. When the airway obstruction is significant there may be episodes of severe cyanosis (“blue baby”) that can lead to unconsciousness. Recurrent respiratory infections are common and secondary pulmonary secretions can further increase the airway obstruction.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on {{analysis}} of neighboring noise as a disturbance agent. This problematics is closely connected with psychoacoustics or more generally with psychology. Therefore, methodology of research is based primarily on listening tests and questionnaires. The main research question lies in evaluation of difference of low/medium/high <b>pitch</b> <b>noise</b> on acoustic comfort of users. For purpose of this a method of auralization was introduced. The model was created by ODEON software and source noises were virtually reproduced through different partition walls. The virtual records in receiving room were accordingly replayed within listening tests. Results have shown {{that it is not}} easy to define one exact formula and answers depend on exact sounds and even there is not agreement through all of respondents. It should be mentioned that amount of respondents is too small for any definite statements. However, there is non-obvious and unexpected inclination to evaluated multi-layered light-weight structures as subjectively worse than adequately insulating concrete wall – at least from results obtained in this test. The possible explanation is an unnatural frequency spectrum of resulting sounds which are perceived as more disturbing despite they have lower sound pressure levels then in case of structure from reinforced concrete...|$|E
50|$|Many {{people are}} {{unconscious}} of their sniffling, hence {{the stereotype of}} children as more apt to sniffle, since they are less conscious of stigma.

40|$|The {{events of}} September 11, 2001, are now as iconic as the World Trade Center Towers themselves. Even in the moment, {{those of us}} present during the attacks knew that what we were seeing was important, seminal, and historic. They also {{represent}} the type of "single-blow" trauma that is most difficult for victims to effectively process, leaving them "stuck" {{in the moment of}} attack. 'Septation,' a five-movement multimedia work for eleven instruments with prerecorded audio and video, is an artistic revisiting of my own experience of the September 11 attacks. The piece is designed to convey such emotional elements of the lived experience as constriction and claustrophobia, disorientation, surprise, powerlessness, felt terror, transformation, and lost innocence. 'Septation' achieves this through a combination of fully composed music; guided solo and ensemble improvisation (involving a variety of <b>pitch,</b> <b>noise</b> and conceptual resources); prepared, spatialized and processed instruments; found-sound audio; and symbolic video elements. In addition to a detailed exploration of the compositional strategies employed in 'Septation,' the thesis argues that the public record of an event of explicit terrorism must convey felt terror and other emotional elements of the lived experience to be complete. Further, it argues that, for a variety of reasons, the nexus of composed and improvised music may be best suited to this task. In composing and presenting 'Septation,' I exorcised some of the lingering demons of this single-blow event in ways that I hope can provide a compelling example for other victims of single-blow trauma...|$|E
40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to find out the {{vulnerability}} of school children affected by roadside vehicle noise. Materials and Methods: The noise levels were measured in three time zones: 10. 45 and 11. 45 am, 12 and 1 pm, and 2 and 3 pm. A self-made interview schedule was constructed for getting feedback from the teachers and students about the problems associated with the teaching - learning process. The different percentile values L 10, L 50, L 90 were used for the evaluation of noise climate (NC), equivalent noise level (Leq), transport noise index, and noise pollution level (L NP). Results: The results revealed that the average distance of the roadside school situated in urban area (9. 4 feet) was much less than in rural area (14. 4 feet). The average number of vehicles in rural areas was much less than in urban areas. The study also demonstrated that out of five varieties of vehicles, only heavy vehicles like bus and trucks produce intense noise (85 - 90 dB). Although air siren of train has a very high noise, which range from 90 to 115 dB, other varieties of light vehicles also produced noise ranges from 76 to 90 dB. The average noise meter reading clearly indicates that lesser the distance from the roadside, higher is the noise intensity. Conclusion: Results revealed that not all schools, particularly those schools that are very close to the roadside, are intensely affected by such high <b>pitch</b> <b>noise</b> and subsequently teaching - learning process were also greatly affected by such activities. Therefore, it is highly recommended that village committee and municipality authority should coordinate with the school authority for taking measures for such irreversible damaged...|$|E

40|$|Curve squeal is {{an intense}} high <b>pitched</b> <b>noise</b> {{generated}} by railway wheels when traversing tight curves. In this paper, a general squeal model is presented, {{which is based}} on the interrelationship between the wheel/rail contact forces and their responses, in the longitudinal, lateral, vertical and spin directions. Using the parameters of steady-state curving behaviour of a passenger vehicle for a range of curve radii, the general curve squeal model can predict the occurrence of squeal at all four wheel/rail contacts in a bogie. The effectiveness of conventional control methods for curve squeal, i. e. wheel damping treatments and friction modification, are investigated...|$|R
40|$|The called {{vibratory}} instability squeal {{that appears}} in narrow curve or in end of braking is today uncontrolled and produced a high <b>pitched</b> <b>noise</b> very intense and unbearable.

However, the question is why this system has a various efficiency even on similar wheels and if this solution may be optimized.

Wheel modes susceptible to squeal are highlighted and numerical models are developed in order to simulate how the acoustic attenuation occur...|$|R
30|$|The {{number of}} r {{played a crucial}} role in extracting note events. If the number of r was set higher than the actual active <b>pitches,</b> <b>noise</b> would appear as {{transcribed}} notes. On the contrary, if the number of r was set too low, events from different pitches would be transcribed as coming from the same pitch. To find the exact number of r is therefore a big challenge for polyphonic transcription using NMF [16]. In recent works by [6, 15], NMF with a fixed W that learned from a desired instrument was proposed. In these works, the dictionary matrix, the pitch templates and the Tone-models acted as the basis vector matrix. This work extended the same concept to handle common limitations of NMF in polyphonic transcribing application.|$|R

This would result in a high <b>pitched</b> <b>noise</b> with which operators were very familiar and could hear even outside the computer room, and damage to the cards.

40|$|Dental drills {{produce a}} {{characteristic}} noise that is uncomfortable for patients {{and is also}} known to be harmful to dentists under prolonged exposure. It is therefore desirable to protect the patient and dentist whilst allowing two-way communication, which will require a headphone- type system.

The agents drive to the remote home of the janitor, Kyle Gilligan, and are confronted by his adoptive mother. Mulder is once again incapacitated by the high <b>pitched</b> <b>noise</b> which only he can hear. Noticing a nearby flock of birds, Scully quickly locates Kyle, forces him to stop, and takes him in to custody. Kyle reveals that he killed Sanjay unintentionally and demands to meet his sister, {{who is one of}} Goldman's test subjects. Kyle is taken to Goldman's lab, where he is presented with a girl who Goldman claims to be his sister. However, Kyle quickly realizes that the girl is a decoy and not his actual sister, and he runs down the corridor where he encounters the irate patient from earlier - his real sister, Molly. After speaking to each other telepathically, the siblings use their telepathic abilities to repel the agents. Utilizing the same high pitched sound that had earlier killed Sanjay and incapacitated Mulder, they kill Goldman and flee the Nugenics building.|$|R
