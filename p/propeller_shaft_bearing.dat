40|$|Ever {{since their}} first appearances, azimuthing podded propulsors have become {{increasingly}} popular. In a parallel development, {{there has been an}} increasing interest in arctic shipping. Hence, the number of vessels with azimuthing podded propulsors being capable of navigating in arctic conditions is increasing. The aim {{of this study is to}} help the understanding of ice effects on this type of propulsors. The knowledge generated could then be used in updating the regulations governing the design of vessels for arctic navigation, including the podded propulsion systems, by the International Association of Classification Societies. The paper describes the preliminary experimental results obtained in this study so far. The setup designed and built at NRC-IOT, Canada, has the capabiligy of measuring the loads on a podded propeller system operating in ice. It is able to measure loads on the entire model, <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>bearing</b> loads and clade loads.

2500|$|Bozeman Victory {{served as}} an {{ammunition}} ship in the Pacific War. Bozeman Victory departed Mukilteo, Washington with ammunition to supply troops at Okinawa for the Battle of Okinawa. The Battle of Okinawa was 82 days, lasted from April 1 until June 22, 1945. On April 28, 1945 a Japanese assault demolition boat causes extensive damage to the Bozeman Victory. [...] US Navy gunboats were credited with keeping the ships at the bay off Okinawa safe. But a Japanese explosive speedboat slipped through. Bozeman Victory was hit at 2:10am while at anchor. Bozeman Victory hull plates were badly damaged near cargo hold #4. [...] Six crew members were injured in the attack. Some of <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>bearings</b> were cracked in the hit, these immobilized the ship. This damage was bad, {{but none of the}} ships cargo, 6,000 tons of ammunition was damaged.

40|$|The {{excitation}} of {{a submarine}} hull by the propeller through ﬂuctuating ﬂuid and shaft forces is investigated. The forces are due {{primarily to the}} operation of the propeller in a non-uniform wake and occur in the low frequency range. The resulting propeller pressure ﬁeld can be represented by dipoles which are normal to and along the propeller axis, with the origin at the propeller hub. The hub forces act in the opposite direction to the ﬂuid forces and are modiﬁed in transmission to the thrust block. Both ﬂuid and shaft forces excite vibration of the hull. The axisymmetric vibration associated with accordion modes is a powerful source of sound radiation, so this work focuses on the effect of the axial propeller forces. A simpliﬁed axisymmetric model of a submarine hull has been developed using the ﬁnite element method to represent the behaviour of the structure and the boundary element method to represent the properties of the ﬂuid domain. The model includes a rigid conical section at the aft end of the pressure hull to represent the free-ﬂood structure that supports the aft <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>bearing.</b> This is connected to a dynamic model of the pressure hull itself. It is shown that the conical tail section {{plays an important role in}} hull excitation through the ﬂuid. A resonance changer can be used to attenuate the vibration transmission through the propeller shaft, but not the excitation via the ﬂuid. In this paper it is shown how the overall performance of the resonance changer is inﬂuenced by the ﬂuid forces...|$|E

The experimental system is designed and built to measure the loads on the blade, on the <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>bearings,</b> on the <b>shaft,</b> and on the whole propulsion unit (global loads). Experiments have been conducted at various headings form 00 to 1800, thrust directions (aft or forward), and advance coefficients. In the experiments, ice sheets of 60 mm thickness were used. Target flexural strength of the ice sheets was 60 kPa {{at the start of}} the experiments. During the course of the experiments, thickness, flexural, compressive and shear strength values of the ice sheets were sampled at certain time intervals in order to record the variations in the ice properties.

40|$|In this chapter, various {{environmental}} {{issues from the}} shipping industry which {{ends up in the}} oceans are described. Oil pollution, wastewater, antifouling paint, ballast water and litter are all described in detail. Various sources of oil pollution exist, ranging from large accidents to small continuous leakages from, e. g., <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>bearings.</b> The behaviour of oil when it enters the sea can differ, ultimately affecting the environment. Wastewater from ships is divided into sewage and grey water, and different regulations can affect their characteristics. Fouling on ship hulls affects the drag on the ship, which increases fuel consumption when maintaining a constant speed. The various antifouling paints used today to combat fouling are described herein, and a review of the environmental implications of using these paints is provided. Ballast water contains organisms that can become invasive if released into a new geographical area. Invasive species can entail costs on the order of millions of euros. Finally, litter is discussed in this chapter. Litter is deposited in the ocean via several sources and can affect organisms over long periods of time. Plastic causes the largest litter-related problem because it does not biodegrade; such material only becomes smaller, ultimately reaching a microplastic state. Henee, litter can affect organisms in different ways...|$|R

Meanwhile, the base continued to overhaul and repair surface vessels. Consequently, the workforce grew to nearly 5,000 civilians. It grew to almost 25,000 civilians in World War II when over 70 submarines were constructed at the yard, {{with a record of}} 4 launched in a single day.

40|$|In {{order to}} study the bearing force caused by the {{machining}} errors of composite material propeller in non-uniform flow, the propeller was computed by changing the machining error of the propeller in six degrees of freedom, in which the main blade translates and rotates along the coordinate axis artificially {{by way of the}} statistical method. The bearing force of a DTMB P 4119 propeller with a machining error was calculated according to the SST k-ω model and sliding meshing non-uniform flow to figure out the impact of various machining errors on the propeller, enabling a fundamental rule about the impact of various machining errors on a propeller's bearing force to be formed. The results show that vertical bearing force and horizontal bearing force increase linearly, and first-order blade frequency bearing force rarely changes with the increase of machining errors in each freedom; machining errors along the directions of diameter and pitch have a great impact on the <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft's</b> frequency <b>bearing</b> force. Therefore, we can put forward a more refined principle about the machining accuracy of propellers...|$|R

40|$|Elastomeric compounds, due {{to their}} {{favourable}} properties like sufficient hardness, toughness and natural resistance to abrasion and corrosion, are commonly used as <b>bearing</b> material for <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> system of Indian Coast Guard Ships. Recently unequal and non-uniform wear of these bearings has resulted in unscheduled lay off of the Coast Guard Ships. To solve this problem of bearing wear, a mixed lubrication analysis of sea-water lubricated journal bearing has been attempted in the present study. A computer code was written to estimate lubricating film thickness for a given set of load and speed condition, and to predict the lubrication regime for the specified surface roughness parameters. To validate the theoretical analysis performed in the present study, the results obtained from the computer simulation have been compared with the established studies on the water lubricated bearing.

500|$|At 20:48, the American {{submarine}} , {{commanded by}} Commander Joseph F. Enright, picked up Shinano and her escorts on her radar and pursued {{them on a}} parallel course. Over {{an hour and a}} half earlier, Shinano had detected the submarine's radar. Normally, Shinano would have been able to outrun Archerfish, but the zig-zagging movement of the carrier and her escorts—intended to avoid submarine attack—inadvertently turned the task group back into the sub's path on several occasions. At 22:45, the carrier's lookouts spotted Archerfish on the surface and Isokaze broke formation, against orders, to investigate. Abe ordered the destroyer to return to the formation without attacking because he believed that the submarine was part of an American wolfpack and that Archerfish was being used as a decoy to lure away one of the escorts to allow the rest of the pack a clear shot at Shinano. He ordered his ships to turn away from the submarine with the expectation of outrunning it, counting on his [...] margin of speed over the submarine. Around 23:22, the carrier was forced to reduce speed to , the same speed as Archerfish, to prevent damage to the <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> when a <b>bearing</b> overheated.|$|R

Design procedure of bearings in question based on materials made available by producers is relatively simple. However it turns out that choice of an appropriate sliding material, clearance value and optimum arrangement of lubricating grooves may greatly influence bearing’s properties. As results from the performed research investigations, bearing of the kind is a highly sensitive unit. Problems of choosing a suitable bearing clearance, designing an optimum bush geometry, selecting a proper bush material are crucial for life time of the bearing.

40|$|This degree {{project has}} been made in {{cooperation}} with engineers working for GM Engineering/Saab Automobile AB in Trollhättan. The given name by Saab for the project is “Fuel efficiency improvements in All Wheel Drive(AWD) -system”. The main tasks of this thesis work were to investigate the size of the power losses in different parts on the <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft,</b> to design a computer program that calculates coordinates and angles on a <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft</b> and to investigate the possibilities to put together a simplified formula that calculates the natural frequencies on a <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft.</b> The main parts of this report are a compilation of the theory about AWD and mostly about the parts on the <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft,</b> and also a description of the developed computer program called <b>Propeller</b> <b>Shaft</b> Calculator. This report doesn’t concern power losses in the different joints because there were no such general equations to be found. The most common way to calculate the power losses inside a joint is to do tests were the power loss is measured at different angles, torque and speed and then use that data to put together an approximated equation. Most of the work on this {{project has been}} on theory studies and on programming. The main result of the project is the program <b>Propeller</b> <b>Shaft</b> Calculator. <b>Propeller</b> <b>Shaft</b> Calculator is a program that is designed in Microsoft Excel. All the menus are programmed in the visual basic editor in Excel. The program is supposed {{to be used as a}} help while designing new <b>propeller</b> <b>shafts.</b> <b>Propeller</b> <b>Shaft</b> Calculator can calculate all the coordinates, lengths, angles and directions on a <b>propeller</b> <b>shaft.</b> It also calculates natural frequencies, plunge, estimated power loss on the second shaft and angles in the joints.
