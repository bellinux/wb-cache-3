40|$|Thiouracil is a thyrostat {{inhibiting}} {{the thyroid}} function, resulting in fraudulent weight gain if {{applied in the}} fattening of livestock. The latter abuse is strictly forbidden and monitored in the European Union. Recently, endogenous sources of thiouracil were identified after frequently monitoring low-level thiouracil positive urine samples and a "recommend concentration" (RC) of 10 ∼g/L was suggested by the EURL to facilitate decision-making. However, the systematic occurrence of urine samples exceeding the RC led to demands for international surveys defining an epidemiologic threshold. Therefore, six European member states (France, Poland, The Netherlands, United Kingdom, Norway, and Belgium) have shared their official thiouracil data (2010 - 2012) collected from bovines, <b>porcines,</b> and small livestock with 95 and 99 % percentiles of 8. 1 and 18. 2 ∼g/L for bovines (n = 3894); 7. 4 and 13. 5 ∼g/L for <b>porcines</b> (n = 654); and 7. 4 ∼g/L (95 % only) for small livestock (n = 85), respectively.

We sought to investigate whether commercially available glutaraldehyde-fixed <b>porcine</b> heart valve prostheses cause <b>porcine</b> endogenous retrovirus infection in human subjects because recent studies revealed that human cells can be infected with <b>porcine</b> endogenous retrovirus. Methods: Blood samples of 18 patients who underwent aortic or mitral valve replacement with <b>porcine</b> heart valves were collected 6 months to 3 years after operation and tested for <b>porcine</b> endogenous retrovirus by means of polymerase chain reaction and reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction. In addition, we tried to trace <b>porcine</b> endogenous retrovirus in 3 commercially available, glutaraldehyde-fixed, <b>porcine</b> heart valves. Results: <b>Porcine</b> endogenous retrovirus can be easily detected in native <b>porcine</b> heart valves and degrades completely within 1 week of fixation in glutaraldehyde. In all 3 commercially available <b>porcine</b> heart valves, no traces of <b>porcine</b> endogenous retrovirus were found.

Sperm incubation in capacitating medium (CM) supplemented with 10 mM heparin for up to 120 min, showed {{an increase in the number}} of capacitated sperm (B pattern) and acrosome reacted sperm (AR pattern), without affecting their viability. In this condition, spermatozoa were incubated in CM depleted of albumin, calcium, bicarbonate or combinations, in the presence of heparin. In either calcium or bicarbonate-free media, capacitation was only basal and did not show variations in the presence of heparin. In absence of albumin the presence of calcium and bicarbonate stimulated capacitation, which was further increased by the addition of heparin. These results suggest that heparin enhances in vitro capacitation of porcine sperm only under capacitating conditions. Additionally, when sperm were incubated with 100 µg/ml biotinylated heparin in the presence or absence of unlabeled heparin, we observed that heparin binding sites were located mostly on the acrosomal region of boar sperm in an specific and saturable manner.

40|$|Endotoxic lipopolysaccharides (LPS) 1 have {{a potent}} ability to {{interact}} with complement (C) during incubation in normal mammalian serum (2, 3). Lesions indicative of terminal C component activation appear on LPS (2, 4) while, concomitantly, C components are consumed and C-dependent biologically active by-products (neutrophil chemotactic factor and anaphylatoxin) are generated (5 - 7). As a result, it has been postulated that certain toxicities induced by endotoxins may be mediated via the C system. (8, 9). One striking feature of the LPS-C interaction in fresh guinea pig serum is that marked consumption of the six terminal C components (C 3 -C 9) occurs, even though minimal consumption of the earlier-acting C components (C 1, C 4, and C 2) is detected (5). When hyperimmune serum {{is added to the}} reaction mixtures, pronounced consumption of C 1, C 4, and C 2, as well as C 3 -C 9, is readily seen (3). This has raised the question of whether LPS activates the C 3 -C 9 components via the usual pathway of antibody-C 1 -C 4 -C 2 (10 - 12) or via an alternative pathway. Hence, the present investigation was concerned with the role of the factors usually responsible for activation of C, classical humoral antibodies, in initiating the LPS-C interaction. The requirement of antibody for the consumption of C by LPS was investigated. Initial attempts to deplete antibodies to LPS by selective absorptions proved noncritical, in part because of solubilization of LPS (2).

Anti-CD 59 and anti-decay accelerating factor (DAF) monoclonal antibody were used to investigate whether human complement regulatory proteins inhibit <b>porcine</b> complement. RESULTS: After 64 hr of perfusion of <b>porcine</b> livers with human blood, mean complement activity in the perfusate was 95 % of the starting value and increasing, whereas perfusion {{in the absence of a}} liver showed a falling complement activity of 28. 7 %. ELISA demonstrated <b>porcine</b> immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM in the xenoperfused human plasma. Whereas in a previous study flow cytometry demonstrated <b>porcine</b> antibodies specific for antigens on human T lymphocytes, in this study, anti-human RBC antibodies were not found. Xenoperfused human plasma did not lyse fresh human RBC. Human complement was consistently more efficient at lysing <b>porcine</b> RBC than was <b>porcine</b> complement at lysing human RBC, and human plasma inhibited the ability of <b>porcine</b> plasma to lyse human RBC, raising the possibility of cross-species complement regulation.

The authors studied the corneal response to variable intraocular pressure (IOP) in <b>porcines</b> eyes after UV collagen cross-linking (CXL), in comparison with untreated eyes. METHODS: Twenty-three enucleated eyes were treated with standard CXL conditions (365 nm, 3 mW, 30 minutes), and 15 contralateral eyes served as control. Eyes (within a humidity- and temperature-monitored wet chamber) were measured by Scheimpflug corneal three-dimensional topographer. Images were obtained automatically while IOP either remained constant (14 eyes) or increased (24 eyes) by 40 mm Hg and then decreased (4 -mm Hg steps). Measurements were performed immediately after treatment and 24 hours later. Corneal geometry was analyzed {{as a function of}} IOP, and whole globe stress-strain curves were calculated. RESULTS: Instillation of riboflavin-dextran solution reduced corneal thickness (by 281 +/- 5 microm). Cross-linking produced a 1. 54 x reduction in corneal thinning and 2. 8 x reduction in corneal apical rise with increased IOP. Anterior and posterior cornea flattened with increased IOP (less flattening in CXL eyes) and became steeper with decreased IOP. The horizontal meridian flattened significantly (P < 0. 01) more than the vertical meridian. Young's modulus was higher in cross-linked eyes (1. 096 +/- 0. 30 kN/m(2)) than in non-cross-linked eyes (0. 692 +/- 0. 30 kN/m(2)). Hysteresis in nontreated eyes was also larger than in cross-linked eyes. CONCLUSIONS: Cross-linking stiffened porcine corneas significantly. Both experimental data and stress-strain analysis are valuable for finite element models to improve understanding of CXL and its predictability. Although differences are expected between human corneas in vivo and porcine corneas ex vivo, the results are consistent with clinical data found in patients. The apparent biomechanical anisotropy of pig corneas must be confirmed in humans. © Association for Research in Vision and OphthalmologyPeer Reviewe...|$|E

Surveillance of novel viruses in animals is essential to evaluate the risk to human and animal health and to determine any economic impact, for example, failure to thrive. There is a paucity of data regarding detection and characterisation of gastroenteritis viruses, particularly novel viruses, in <b>porcines</b> in Ireland. Recently, {{a number of small}} novel porcine DNA viruses have emerged globally, for example, torque teno sus virus, porcine bocavirus, and parvoviruses 2 & 4, and {{little is known about the}} biology and potential pathogenicity of these viruses. Bocaparvovirus is a genetically distinct group of viruses which has been recently detected in humans and animals. Methods: In this study, the presence of gastroenteritis viruses (rotavirus A, porcine circovirus, adenovirus, and porcine bocavirus) was investigated in a selection of archived faecal samples from asymptomatic piglets from a commercial farm in Ireland. A total of 104 specimens were pooled and screened using conventional molecular techniques (PCR and RT-PCR), a subset of specimens (n= 44) were then examined individually. Viral diversity was then investigated using statistical and phylogenetic techniques. Results: Initial screening showed a high prevalence of PBoV in this farm, with the formation of three distinct groups in phylogenetic analysis. Other viruses were also investigated in this study with the first report of PCV, PAdV and lineage I G 5 RVA in Ireland. Some specimens contained > 1 virus, with statistical analysis indicating a strong correlation for mixed infections of PBoV and PAdV on this farm.

La formulation EPA:DHA 6 : 1 inhibe les contractions induites par les plaquettes impliquant la sérotonine dans les artères coronaires de porc, et les contractions à la sérotonine dans les artères coronaires <b>porcines</b> et mammaires internes humaines, principalement par une augmentation de la formation endothéliale de NO. Ces résultats indiquent que la formulation optimisée EPA:DHA 6 : 1 exerce un effet bénéfique sur le système cardiovasculaire via l’activation de la fonction endothéliale...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: We have {{previously}} demonstrated that <b>porcine</b> livers perfused with human blood remove {{most of the}} erythrocytes from three units of human blood {{over the course of}} a 72 -h extracorporeal perfusion. Red blood cell loss did not appear to involve classical complement pathway-mediated hemolysis, but instead resulted from <b>porcine</b> Kupffer cell phagocytosis. METHODS: We developed a method incorporating collagenase digestion and metrizamide separation to isolate and maintain <b>porcine</b> Kupffer cells in primary culture. An in vitro rosetting assay was used to assess the binding of human and <b>porcine</b> erythrocytes to <b>porcine</b> Kupffer cells. Immunohistochemistry was used to confirm the presence of <b>porcine</b> macrophages. The rosetting assay was quantified using 51 Cr-labeling of erythrocytes to assay for both rosette formation and phagocytosis. RESULTS: <b>Porcine</b> Kupffer cells were successfully isolated and maintained in primary culture. The presence of <b>porcine</b> macrophages was confirmed using the monoclonal antibody 74 - 22 - 15 A. Human, but not <b>porcine,</b> erythrocytes were bound in an in vitro rosetting assay as confirmed by immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy and 51 Cr-quantitation. <b>Porcine</b> Kupffer cells bound human erythrocytes regardless of the presence of opsonizing antibody. Approximately 70 % of the isolated <b>porcine</b> Kupffer cells demonstrated the capacity to bind non-opsonized human erythrocytes. Phagocytosis was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Using primary <b>porcine</b> Kupffer cell cultures, we have demonstrated that a subpopulation of <b>porcine</b> macrophages has the ability to recognize specifically xenogeneic human erythrocyte epitopes without the need for prior opsonization. The possibility is discussed that lectin-mediated carbohydrate binding plays a role in the cellular and humoral recognition and rejection of xenografts...|$|R

40|$|The cloning, {{characterization}} {{and expression}} of <b>porcine</b> CD 3 epsilon and establishment of {{its role in}} T-cell activation using an anti-porcine CD 3 epsilon monoclonal antibody, as described here, provides a first step towards {{a greater understanding of}} the <b>porcine</b> immune response. <b>Porcine</b> CD 3 epsilon was cloned from a <b>porcine</b> T-cell cDNA library by polymerase chain reaction and found to have up to 72 % identity with other CD 3 epsilon chains, retaining all the necessary primary structural motifs for correct functioning of <b>porcine</b> CD 3 epsilon. When expressed in COS 7 cells <b>porcine</b> CD 3 epsilon was an intracellularly localized, monomeric 23, 000 MW protein exhibiting no evidence of N-glycosylation. A monoclonal antibody, PPT 3, recognized expressed <b>porcine</b> CD 3 epsilon and activated <b>porcine</b> T cells as demonstrated by stimulation of calcium mobilization, an increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation and proliferation. These results further reaffirm and identify CD 3 epsilon as an important cell surface protein involved in signal transduction of activation signals in <b>porcine</b> T cells...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: We have {{reported}} that {{the changes in the}} accommodative response to electrical stimulation of the branches of the ciliary nerves in cats. (Miyagawa et al, PLoS One, 2014). We have also reported that no robust accommodative responses to the electrical stimulations of the sclera of peripheral cornea (SSPC) were observed in enucleated porcine eyes (Mihashi et al, VPOptics, 2014). In this study, accommodative responses to SSPC stimulation in cats and <b>porcines</b> were investigated. Methods: Two eyes of two cats under anesthesia and after they were sacrificed were studied. Three enucleated porcine eyes obtained from a local slaughterhouse were also studied. Trains of biphasic pulses (current, 3 mA; duration, 2 ms/phase; frequency, 40 Hz) were applied using a tungsten electrode (0. 3 mm diameter) from several orientations. Wavefront sensing with a compact wavefront aberrometer (Uday et al J Cataract Refract Surg, 2013) were performed before and 4 s (cat) and 10 s (pig) after the stimulations and wavefront aberrations including spherical errors were analyzed over a 4 -mm pupil area. Results: In the first cat under anesthesia, at three out of seven stimulus positions, 0. 2 D hyperopic accommodative responses were observed and in two orientations, myopic responses were observed. For the other cat, weak accommodative responses including astigmatic changes were observed. In the sacrificed condition of the second cat, 0. 1 D myopic response was observed for one stimulus orientation and the smaller responses were observed at six out of eight stimulus positions. No accommodative responses were elicited for the enucleated porcine eyes. Conclusions: In the anesthetized cats, electrical stimulation of the SSPC induced accommodative responses; the responses were unstable and weaker than the responses by the ciliary nerve stimulations we observed in our previous study. Small accommodative responses were observed after one of two cats had been sacrificed, but no accommodative responses were detected in the enucleated porcine eyes. Further studies are needed to confirm difference in the accommodation functions in the two species...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: We have {{reported}} that {{the changes in the}} pupillary shape in response to electrical stimulation of the branches of the ciliary nerves in cats. (Miyagawa et al. PLoS One, 2014). This study investigates the changes in the pupillary shapes in response to electrical stimulations of the sclera of peripheral cornea in cats and <b>porcines.</b> Methods: Two enucleated eyes of two cats and three enucleated porcine eyes were studied. Trains of biphasic pulses (current, 3 mA; duration, 2 ms/phase; frequency, 40 Hz) were applied using a tungsten electrode (0. 3 mm diameter). The stimulation was performed at every 45 degree over the entire circular region on the sclera near the cornea. The pupillary images were recorded before and 4 s (cat) and 10 s (pig) after the stimulation and the change in the pupil diameter (Δr) was quantified. The pupillary images were obtained with a custom-built compact wavefront aberrometer (Uday et al. J Cataract Refract Surg, 2013). Results: In a cat eye, the pupil was dilated by the electrical stimulation at six out of eight orientations (before stimulation pupil diameter r= 10. 10 ± 0. 49 mm, Δr= 0. 33 ± 0. 12 mm). The pupil dilated only toward the electrode (relative eccentricity of the pupil center to the pupil diameter change amount rdec= 1. 15 ± 0. 28). In the porcine eyes, the pupils were constricted by the electrical stimulations at the temporal and nasal orientations (r= 10. 04 ± 0. 57 mm, Δr= 1. 52 ± 0. 70 mm). The pupils contracted symmetrically (rdec= 0. 30 ± 0. 12). Conclusions: With electrical stimulation in the sclera of the peripheral cornea, asymmetric mydriasis in cat eyes and symmetrical miosis in porcine eyes were observed. Under the assumption that the electrical stimulation stimulated both muscles that contribute to the pupil control, our hypothesis proposed here is that the pupil dilator is stronger than the pupil sphincter in cat, and pupil sphincter is stronger than pupil dilator in porcine...|$|E
40|$|Background. Recently rodent and porcine {{bone marrow}} stromal cells (MSCs) have been {{reported}} to be uniquely immune tolerant. In order to confirm these findings in human cells, we tested the hypothesis that human MSCs are also immune tolerant, such that they can be useful as "universal donor cells" for myocardial regenerative therapy. Methods. Immunocompetent female rats underwent left coronary ligations (n= 90). They were randomized into 3 groups. In Group I, lac-Z labeled male human MSCs were implanted into the peri-infarcted area. In Group II and III isogenic rat MSCs or culture medium were injected respectively. Echocardiography was carried out to assess cardiac function, and the specimens were examined serially for up to 8 weeks with immunohistochemistry, FISH and PCR to examine MSCs survival and differentiation. Results. Human MSCs were found to survive within the rat myocardium without immunosuppression. This was confirmed by PCR and FISH test. No cellular infiltration characteristic of immune rejection was noted. Some of these cells appeared to express cardiomyocyte-specific markers such as troponin-Ic and connexin- 43. Furthermore, the implanted MSCs significantly contributed to the improvement in ventricular function and attenuated LV remodeling. Conclusions. Human MSC survived within this xenogeneic environment, and contributed to the improvement in cardiac function. Our findings support the feasibility of using these cells as "universal donor cells" for xeno- or allo-geneic cell therapy, as they can be tested, prepared and stored well in advance for urgent use. Allogeneic MSCs from healthy donors may be particularly useful for severely ill or elderly patients whose own MSCs could be dysfunctional.

40|$|Objective: We have {{previously}} reported that <b>porcine</b> valve endothelium does not express immunodetectable {{levels of the}} carbohydrate Gal� 1 - 3 Gal� 1 - 4 GlcNAc-R (known as �Gal), suggesting that fresh <b>porcine</b> valve may be immunoprivileged. In this study, we further investigated the mechanisms of �Gal expression on <b>porcine</b> valve endothelial cells. Methods: Primary cultures of <b>porcine</b> valvular endothelial cells were established and compared with <b>porcine</b> aortic endothelial cells and human vein endothelial cells. Immunoblotting, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and flow cytometry were {{used to compare the}} expression of �Gal at both the protein and messenger RNA levels. ACD Results: <b>Porcine</b> valvular endothelial cells grew rapidly on a gelatin substrate. Similar to our previous in vivo results, valve endothelial cells expressed �Gal much less intensely than did aortic endothelial cells. <b>Porcine</b> aortic endothelial cells expressed an isolectin B 4 (isolectin B 4 lectin Bandeiraea simplicifolia) immunodetectable band at 135 kd that was not visible on <b>porcine</b> valve endothelial cells or on human vein endothelial cells. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction documented three transcripts of the �Gal gene that were identically expressed on <b>porcine</b> valve and aortic endothelial cells. Furthermore, flow cytometry showed an almost identical surface profile between <b>porcine</b> aortic and valve endothelial cells, in contrast with human vein endothelial cells...|$|R
