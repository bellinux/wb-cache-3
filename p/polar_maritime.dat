5|$|The {{climate of}} Buenos Aires is {{dominated}} by the semi–permanent South Atlantic High throughout the year. This brings in moist winds from the northeast, which brings most of the precipitation to the city. During winter, it brings in frontal systems responsible for precipitation in the city. In autumn and summer, it produces storms that are generally located north of the city and produces strong winds from the south or southeast that can occasionally lead to the swelling of the Río de la Plata, flooding coastal areas. The South Pacific High is the origin of polar air masses that are responsible for the coldest temperatures and result in clear and very dry conditions. These air masses originate from the South Pacific high and move in a northeastern direction during winter towards Buenos Aires by passing. Although it is <b>polar</b> <b>maritime</b> (this is a cool, moist air mass that forms from oceans located in the subarctic and arctic regions at the southern tip of South America), it becomes modified as it passes over the South American continent, becoming drier as it arrives at Buenos Aires. This is because as the cold air masses from the South Pacific High move over the Pacific Ocean and the Andes and reach the land south of 35oS (where the Andes are shorter in height), anticyclogenesis leads to the formation of a strong high pressure system {{in the center of the}} country (at around 40oS). This high pressure system brings cold and dry, polar continental air masses to Buenos Aires. Cold fronts are more common during winter than in summer as the South Atlantic and South Pacific highs are at their southernmost positions during summer, making it difficult for cold fronts to enter.|$|E

Średnia długotrwałość mas zmienia się od 1, 4 dnia (masa PP_m_c w lecie) do 4, 5 dnia (masa PP_k w zimie). Największą długotrwałością występowania, niezależnie od pory roku cechują się masy PP_k (maksymalnie do 30 dni), a najmniejszą masy PP_m i PP_m_c. Czas utrzymywania się nad Polską Południową mas zależy nie tylko od ich częstości, ale też od kierunku adwekcji. Istotny wzrost średniej długotrwałości cechuje masy PA w zimie. The {{duration}} of six types of air masses was identified in southern Poland {{over the period}} 1951 – 2009. A calendar of air masses developed by T.

The study determined the average {{duration of}} air masses per season {{and the frequency of}} sequences of days with individual air masses. Linear regression analysis was used to identify trends in the average duration. The duration of air masses investigated in southern Poland was found to be highly variable. The average duration varied in the range from 1. 4 days of the warm <b>polar</b> <b>maritime</b> air (PP_m_c) in summer to 4. 5 days of the polar continental air (PP_k) in winter. The largest number of air–mass spells ranged from one to three days.

The Advection vector determined air mass duration more than the frequency of occurrence. The highly stable easterly air circulation was found to promote long durations of uniform air masses over the area and produced longer periods dominated by PP_k air. In the long term, average durations followed a number of various trends, of which only the trend of to an increase in the average duration of arctic air in winter was statistically significant.

To study these effects, measurements of trace gases ozone, Os, carbon monoxide, CO, and odd nitrogen were made aboard the NCAR Sabreliner on 18 flights over the southern Great Plains during June 1985. To demonstrate chemical changes induced by vertical motions in the atmosphere and to facilitate comparison with computer model calculations, these data were categorized according to synoptic flow patterns. Part 1 of this two-part paper details the alternating pulses of <b>polar</b> and <b>maritime</b> air masses that dominate the vertical mixing in this region. In this paper, trace gas measurements are presented as altitude profiles (0 - 12 km) with statistical distributions of mixing ratios for each species in each flow pattern. The polar flow regime is characterized by northwesterly winds, subsiding air, and convective stability. Concentrations of CO and total odd nitrogen (NOy) are relatively high in the shallow planetary boundary layer (PBL) but decrease rapidly with altitude. Ozone, on the other hand, is uniformly distributed, suggesting limited photochemical production; in fact, nitric oxide, NO, mixing ratios fell below 10 ppt (parts per 10 • 2 by volume) in the midtroposphere. The maritime regime is characterized by southerly surface winds, convective instability, and a deep PBL; uniformly high concentrations of trace gases were found up to 4 km on one flight. Severe storms occur in maritime flow, especially when capped by a dry layer, and they transport large amounts of CO, Os, and NOy into the upper troposphere.

40|$|Background: Wild berries are {{a valued}} {{traditional}} food in Alaska. Phytochemicals in wild berries {{may contribute to}} the prevention of vascular disease, cancer and cognitive decline, making berry consumption important to community health in rural areas. Little was known regarding which species of berries were important to Alaskan communities, the number of species typically picked in communities and whether recent environmental change has affected berry abundance or quality. Objective: To identify species of wild berries that were consumed by people in different ecological regions of Alaska and to determine if perceived berry abundance was changing for some species or in some regions. Design: We asked tribal environmental managers throughout Alaska for their views on which among 12 types of wild berries were important to their communities and whether berry harvests over the past decade were different than in previous years. We received responses from 96 individuals in 73 communities. Results: Berries that were considered very important to communities differed among ecological regions of Alaska. Low-bush blueberry (Vaccinium uliginosum and V. caespitosum), cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus) and salmonberry (Rubus spectabilis) were most frequently identified as very important berries for communities in the boreal, <b>polar</b> and <b>maritime</b> ecoregions, respectively. For 7 of the 12 berries on the survey, a majority of respondents indicated that in the past decade abundance had either declined or become more variable. Conclusions: Our study {{is an example of how}} environmental managers and participants in local observer networks can report on the status of wild resources in rural Alaska. Their observations suggest that there have been changes in the productivity of some wild berries in the past decade, resulting in greater uncertainty among communities regarding the security of berry harvests.

40|$|Directional {{analysis}} {{has been used}} to study changes in the sub-polar climate of the mountainous and glacierised sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia (54 - 55 °S, 36 - 38 °W). Significantly for climate change studies, South Georgia lies in the Scotia Sea between polar and temperate latitudes, and approximately 1000 km northeast and downwind of the Antarctic Peninsula - one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth (Vaughan et al., 2001). South Georgia was chosen for directional analysis because its climate is substantially advected by predominantly westerly circulations, and because it has a long (since 1905) meteorological record from King Edward Point (KEP) on its eastern side. Additional shorter records from Bird Island at the northwest tip of South Georgia allow comparison between windward (Bird Island) and leeward (KEP) climate regimes. The variation of mountain barrier heights with direction from KEP allows climate changes to be studied under different amounts of orographic influence (from ~ 700 m to ~ 2200 m). Records of glacier advance and retreat provide further independent evidence of climate change for comparison with the meteorological record. Directional climate analysis is based on a series of monthly-mean pressure fields defining the orientation and strength of synoptic-scale air-mass advection over the Scotia Sea. These fields are used to define directional climatologies for six 30 ° sectors with bearings from 150 - 180 ° to 300 - 330 °; these sectors encompass 99 % of recorded months since 1905. The climatologies summarise the frequencies of air masses from each sector, and the accompanying temperatures and precipitation. The 6 sectors can be broadly associated with 4 air-mass types and source regions: (i) sectors 150 - 210 ° advect cold <b>polar</b> <b>maritime</b> air that originated over the Antarctic continent before passing over the Weddell Sea, (ii) sectors 210 - 270 ° advect warmer, more stable <b>polar</b> <b>maritime</b> air from the Bellingshausen Sea/Antarctic Peninsula region, (iii) sector 270 - 300 ° has warmer, drier returning <b>polar</b> <b>maritime</b> circulated from the Bellingshausen Sea and across the Andes, and (iv) sector 300 - 330 ° has warm, humid tropical maritime air from the South Atlantic High. Detailed climatologies are compared for 4 distinct time periods covering: glacier advance (1920 - 1951), glacier retreat (1951 - 82), the latest decade (2000 - 2009), and a reference period (1905 - 1982). The comparisons show how climate changes between periods are composed of alterations in (i) air-mass frequency from different sectors, and (ii) temperature and precipitation within sectors. The ability of directional analysis to explain climate-change processes is confirmed by comparing directional results for the periods of glacier advance and glacier retreat. Specifically, during the ‘advance’ period the air masses came 20 % more frequently from the 4 colder, southerly sectors and correspondingly less frequently from the 2 warmer, northerly sectors. Moreover, the temperature of air coming from each sector was 0. 1 - 0. 8 °C cooler than during the ‘retreat’ period. Further directional analysis will compare records from the latest decade with previous periods to investigate recent sub-polar climate change, and particularly any advected warming from the Antarctic Peninsula. Directional analysis and advection climatologies can be used to test climate model performance and to examine atmospheric processes under changing climates. Previous directional analyses in an upland region of northwest England have detected changes in its mid-latitude temperate climate that were masked by directionally unsorted data (Malby et al., 2007, Ferranti et al., 2009); the South Georgia study now shows how similar methods can give insights into sub-polar climate change...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{evaluates the}} paraglacial {{evolution}} of a sediment-mantled slope in a <b>polar</b> <b>maritime</b> environment. The intensity of paraglacial processes is estimated through quantifi cation of erosion and dating of fi eld sectors {{with the help of}} photographic archives. Gully erosion has been estimated using morphometric parameters and by surveys of vegetation cover. The rapid melting of dead-ice cores controls gully formation. This leads to slope form modifi cation: gully profi le gradients are reduced from a mean of 35 ° to a mean ranging between 10 ° and 15 °. Profi le evolution results from the collapse of glacier lateral moraine. All data (mean slope angle of individual gullies, frequency distribution of slope angles, fractional distance to the apex, gullying index, volume of debris mobilized, vertical erosion rate) tend to increase with increasing deglaciation age and the duration of paraglacial activity. Vegetation colonization is a response to stabilization of the ground surface and the drying up of the ground surface due to dead-ice melting. The full sequence of paraglacial slope adjustment (gully incision-stabilization) may occur rapidly at the study site, i. e. within two decades.
