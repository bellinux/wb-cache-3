Still there was something portentous in the death-like silence with which the victims within the block awaited their fate. The whole exterior of the building was already wrapped in flames, and yet no show of further resistance, no petition for mercy, issued from its bosom. The unnatural and frightful stillness, that reigned within, was gradually communicated to those without. The cries and shouts of triumph ceased, and the crackling of the flames, or the falling of timber in the adjoining buildings, alone disturbed the awful calm. At length a solitary voice was heard in the block. Its tones were deep, solemn, and imploring. The fierce beings who surrounded the glowing <b>pile</b> <b>bent</b> forward to listen, for their quick faculties caught the first sounds that were audible. It was Mark Heathcote pouring out his spirit in prayer. The petition was fervent, but steady, and though uttered in words that were unintelligible to those without, they knew enough of the practices of the Colonists, {{to be aware that}} it was the chief of the Pale-faces holding communion with his God. Partly in awe, and partly in doubt of what might be the consequences of so mysterious an asking, the dark crowd with drew to a little distance, and silently watched the progress of the destruction. They had heard strange sayings {{of the power of the}} Deity of their invaders, and as their victims appeared suddenly to cease using any of the known means of safety, they appeared to expect, perhaps they did expect, some unequivocal manifestation of the power of the Great Spirit of the stranger.|$|E

50|$|Activated on 29 September 1950, aboard Camp Pendleton, 7th Engineer Battalion {{was rapidly}} built up with {{equipment}} and troops for deployment to the Korean War. Activated companies included Headquarters, Service, A, B, C, D, with a Fixed Bridge Platoon and Floating Bridge Platoon attached. Deployment orders were never signed and deployment to Korea was not executed.With all its new equipment, 7th Engineer Battalion became the training command for all engineers headed overseas to 1st Engineer Battalion in Korea. From 1951-1954 the battalion also completed various engineering projects aboard Camp Pendleton and constructed cold weather training {{facilities in the}} San Jacinto and Sierra Mountains.7th Engineer Battalion {{was attached to the}} 1st Marine Division in October 1955. In the same year, an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Platoon was attached to the battalion and was mainly used for clearing ranges.In 1956, the battalion conducted a rigorous training cycle focusing on ambushes, construction and bridging. The battalion demonstrated its bridging capabilities when the Santa Margarita River flooded in 1957. An unprecedented, 339 feet of M-6 bridging were used to span the swollen river which, at that time, was the longest M-6 Bridge ever erected. That same year, the battalion increased the size of the Fixed Bridge Platoon to a company and the Floating Bridge Platoon was redesignated to 1st Bridge Platoon together creating a new Bridge Company.In 1962, Company B was embarked aboard ship in support of the Cuban Missile Crisis Response.On 1 June 1965, Company A attached to Regimental Landing Team-7 and embarked ship headed for the Republic of Vietnam.

The battalion returned home to Camp Pendleton by 24 April 1991.7th ESB deployed to Mogadishu, Somalia on 15 December 1992 in support of Operation RESTORE HOPE. From 15 December 1992 to 25 January 1993, EOD Company assisted in over 300 calls for support recovering and disposing of over 350,000 pounds of ordnance and over two million rounds of ammunition. Bulk Fuel Company employed and operated five AAFS and a Tactical Airfield Fuel Dispensing System (TAFDS) which serviced over 26 different nations during the operation. The battalion’s utilities section purified and provided over three million gallons of water to the multinational contingent.In January 1993, while the battalion was deployed to Somalia, the Santa Margarita River flooded, which severely damaged Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS), Camp Pendleton. The Marines of 7th ESB, purified drinking water, rebuilt eight miles of roads and rebuilt the levee that separates the MCAS and the Santa Margarita River.30 December 1994, Bridge Company was deactivated and its personnel and equipment redistributed throughout the battalion. In March 1995, Company A reactivated and constructed the Combat Skills Training Facility at Camp Deluz.During 1996, EOD techs provided range sweeps at multiple Marine Corps and Air Force installation across the southwestern U.S. Additionally, EOD also supported the U.S. Secret Service in Los Angeles and San Diego. February 1996, Company C deployed to the U.S. Army’s National Training Center in Fort Irwin, California where it acted as a ‘Soviet Engineer Battalion’ as opposition force against U.S. Army units.

After the attacks on September 11, 7 ESB attached engineers to MEU Service Support Group (MSSG)-15, 15th MEU, Task Force-58. The Marines were among the first American forces to enter Afghanistan in support of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM (OEF) as they helped establish Camp Rhino providing water purification, electricity, heavy equipment, security and EOD support.In April 2002, Company A participated in DESERT SCIMITAR-02. Bridge platoon constructed a 457-foot continuous-span ribbon bridge over the rapidly flowing Colorado River. The bridge crossed over nearly 1,700 Marines, and over 500 tactical vehicles.On 28 January 2003, the battalion deployed to Camp Coyote, Kuwait in preparation for Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF). On 20 March, Company B and Company C, breached lanes through the Iraqi border obstacle belt providing entry for Task Force Tarawa and Regimental Combat Team (RCT)-7. 7th ESB supported the Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) through all facets of engineering during the push to Baghdad before redeploying to Kuwait on 16 May 2003.The battalion returned to Iraq in February 2004 with elements of Headquarters and Service (H&S) Company, Company A, Support Company, Bulk Fuel Company and EOD Company and assumed the role as Combat Service Support Battalion (CSSB)-1. The bulk of the battalion operated out of Camp Fallujah supporting Regimental RCT-1 and other units in the Al Anbar Province. CSSB-1 participated in Operation VIGILANT RESOLVE by establishing tactical control points (TCP’s) around Fallujah, isolating the city in preparation for offensive operations of RCT-1.By the end of September 2004, 7th ESB conducted a relief in place (RIP) with Company C replacing Company A, while H&S, Bulk Fuel and EOD Companies remained in Iraqi, only rotating personnel from Camp Pendleton. The battalion, minus a few detachments had redeployed back to Camp Pendleton by March 2005.Contingents of 7th ESB companies formed Combat Logistics Battalion (CLB)-5 and deployed to Fallujah, Iraq in early 2006. During the deployment, the battalion provided engineer support throughout the Al Anbar Province. The battalion redeployed to Camp Pendleton in September 2006 while Company A conducted a RIP with Company C. In October 2006, Company B was stood up and was assigned the bridging mission for the battalion. Company A redeployed to Camp Pendleton in March 2007.In August 2007, EOD Company and Company B deployed personnel to Iraq in support of OIF 6-8.2.The battalion deployed to Fallujah, Iraq in February 2008 in support of OIF 6-8.1 and returned in September 2008. Support Company and Company A attached Marines to CLB-7 to deploy in support of OIF 9.1. EOD Company continued to support the global war on terror as they deployed personnel to both Iraq and Afghanistan.Company B attached to CLB-1 and deployed to Afghanistan in support of OEF 9.2 in June 2009. In October 2009, 7th ESB completed it pre-deployment block leave and deployed to Camp Leatherneck, Afghanistan.During its deployment, the battalion provided engineering support throughout Helmand Province. The battalion stood up Combat Logistics Company-7 in order to support 3rd Battalion, 6th Marines and Operation MOSHTARAK during the clear and hold phase into Marjeh, Afghanistan. In May 2010, the battalion completed its RIP with 9th ESB and redeployed to Camp Pendleton.During May 2011, 7th ESB deployed and conducted a relief in place with 8th ESB in Camp Leatherneck, Afghanistan for OEF 11.2. Throughout the deployment the battalion provided mobility by conducting route clearance for International Security Assistance Forces (ISAF). Bridge platoon greatly enhanced mobility throughout the area of operation (AO) by emplacing Medium Girder Bridges (MGB) and building non-standard bridges over wadi’s and irrigation canals. The battalion redeployed to Camp Pendleton on 14 December 2011.In 2012, the battalion supported construction projects across Southern California. Company C completed a road project in Imperial Beach, California for Joint Task Force-North and the Border Patrol.

5000|$|The Cunningham Bridge is a {{historic}} structure located northwest of Bevington, Iowa, United States. It spans the North River for 143 ft. The Madison County Board of Supervisors contracted with the George E. King Bridge Company of Des Moines to replace an existing span {{that was to be}} moved to another site. The wrought iron Pratt pony truss bridge was shipped to the county and erected by June 1886 for $820. [...] The approaches are timber stringer spans, and it is supported by timber <b>pile</b> <b>bents.</b> The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.|$|R
50|$|During 2008 {{the bridge}} {{underwent}} a major refurbishment {{with the aim}} of extending its life for a further 30 years. The bridge has now been designated a bridleway and is a popular local landmark used by both leisure and commuter traffic on foot, bicycle and horseback. It is also a popular spot for local fisherman. The refurbishment completely replaced the pilehead crossbeams, deck support longitudinal beams and handrails with selective replacement and reinforcement of components of each of the 27 <b>pile</b> <b>bents.</b> The project was managed and partly funded by West Sussex County Council. The rest of the funding came from the Heritage Lottery Fund, landfill tax credits and the Old Shoreham Tollbridge Community Trust.|$|R
30|$|Structural {{concrete}} prefabricated {{systems have}} been successfully used with the well-known advantages of construction time reduction {{and the number of}} operations to be performed in situ, improved quality control, work zone safety improvement and lower environmental impact. Unlu [1] proposed various precast concrete systems for the construction of abutments and bent caps. Billington et al. [2] proposed concrete precast systems for the construction of single- and double-column inverted T hammerhead pier caps with connection details. Matsumoto et al. [3] developed a precast concrete system for <b>pile</b> <b>bent</b> caps for non-seismic regions with several connection details. Other {{systems have been}} applied successfully. For example, precast post-tensioned supported bent caps with an inverted T-section with spans up to 17.68  m were used for the U-section bridges in the project mentioned herein. However, there is a practical limit for the span lengths due to the self-weight that can impact safe lifting and placement.|$|E
30|$|The {{evolution}} of pier cap design {{is a consequence}} of the intensive use of bridges caused by the changes in the transportation infrastructures [4]. In general, abutment design has been extensively analyzed [4], particularly for integral abutments. Barr et al. [5] investigated the spalling of an integral abutment bridge in Salt Lake City, UT, through monitoring and finite element modeling. Nikravan [6] studied the behavior of integral bridges subjected to temperature variations using 3 D finite element models. However, pier choices are generally limited to CIP concrete supported either by one hammerhead bent cap or more than one column and <b>pile</b> <b>bent</b> cap [7]. Some special types (straddle bent caps) are briefly addressed elsewhere [8]. Public agencies have guidelines on the design of the most common bent cap types, such as rectangular column bent caps [9, 10], inverted T column bent caps [9, 10] and hammerhead bent caps [11]. However, comparative design/construction guidance for alternates is lacking.|$|E
40|$|The {{direct costs}} of bridge construction, such as materials, labor, and {{equipment}} are all well known. Recently however the indirect costs {{such as the}} cost of traffic disruptions, and construction safety are beginning to be factored into design decisions. These new considerations have led the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to explore Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC), which is also known as a ?get in, get out, stay out? approach to bridge construction and replacement. Accelerated Bridge Construction is defined as replacement, or new bridge construction that uses design and construction methods to minimize impacts to the traveling public, river traffic, railroads, and the environment ? all while maintaining high levels of quality and safety. In other words, make bridge construction faster, and safer, while also making bridges last longer by using modern technology. This project focuses on one approach to ABC construction, using more precast elements, in an attempt to move towards an all precast bridge. Precast elements are fabricated offsite, in a controlled environment, and shipped to the project, where a crane is used to place them. Systems being examined in this project include precast stay?inplace forms for short to medium span bridges, and precast <b>pile</b> <b>bent</b> caps. Both of these systems can be used to dramatically reduce the amount of cast?in?place concrete on a typical bridge project. For the precast stay?in?place formwork system, this report first examines current practices of using precast concrete and bridges, and then identifies possible precast sections for further study in the proposed system. Double?T beam sections are identified for further study, next a series of analyses are run to identify a group of characteristics that would make a newly designed section more efficient. Using these characteristics, a new Channel section is designed, and analyzed against the Double?T section, the new section is found to offer a broader span range, and is designed to reduce several key 12 maintenance issues prevalent in adjacent member bridges. A list of recommendations for further study and discussion on this topic is included. Also included in this report is a construction study done on a bridge near Reynolds Wisconsin which used precast <b>pile</b> <b>bent</b> caps. The report follows the project from the precasting of the pile caps at County Materials in Roberts Wisconsin, to the placement and connection of caps to the piles, in Reynolds Wisconsin. Several problems were experienced with the construction process, and from these a list of recommendations for improvement was generated, and is included with the report...|$|E

50|$|The current {{bridge was}} {{constructed}} in 1970 as a plate girder bridge, consisting of nine steel through plate girder sections supported on eight steel <b>pile</b> <b>bents.</b> The western end of the east approach for the steel through plate girder structure {{is supported by a}} concrete pier on wooden piles built in 1919. The end of the eastern pier is made of concrete. Between 1843 and 1964, three railway bridges were constructed at the site and a navigation channel was dredged, all of which disturbed the Mnjikaning Fish Weirs. The swing bridge was deemed unsafe in a 2010 inspection by the railway. Reports to local police and the railway in 2011 declared that the wooden timber cribbing {{at the base of the}} swing bridge was decaying and shedding material into the water below.|$|R
40|$|Infrastructure {{spending}} {{is such a}} large component of a railroad budget {{that it must be}} prioritized to meet the concurrent safety and line capacity requirements. Current bridge inspection and rating practices recommend observing bridge movements under a live load to help assess bridge conditions. However, measuring bridge movements under trains in the field is a challenging task. Even when they are measured, the relationships between bridge displacements and different loads/speeds are generally unknown. The research reported herein shows the effects of known train loadings, speeds, and traffic directions on the magnitude and frequency of displacements as measured on timber <b>pile</b> <b>bents</b> of a Class I railroad bridge. Researchers collected both vertical and transverse (lateral) displacements under revenue service traffic and work trains using LVDTs with a sampling frequency of 100 Hz. To investigate the effect of traffic on timber railroad bridges, displacements were measured under crossing events at different speeds and directions of a test train of known speed and weight provided by the railroad for the field experiment. The results indicate that bridge transverse displacements could help to capture critical changes in timber railroad bridge serviceability (i. e., ability to safely carry out railroad operations) as a function of railroad loading, speed, and direction.

40|$|Deterioration {{of aging}} bridges can be {{attributed}} to an assortment of mechanisms throughout the structure, with remediation policies also varying. This study focused on assessing the validity of the Nebraska Department of Roads’ (NDOR) reinforced concrete encasement retrofit for corroded steel HP piles. Experiments were designed and conducted to test the capacity of the NDOR retrofit and evaluate failure limit states. Two pile locations were considered: abutment and <b>pile</b> <b>bent.</b> For each location there was a non-deteriorated, deteriorated, and retrofitted case. These cases represented the pile at key stages during its life. NDOR’s concrete encasement retrofit provided the required stability and composite action to return the pile to full capacity. The key finding of the experimental study was a greater than anticipated steel-concrete bond stress. The bond stress observed was three times greater than the nominal recommended by AISC. A computational study was also conducted to investigate sensitivities and alternative configurations, such as geometric alterations, material properties, and reinforcement. The computational study emphasized the load transfer mechanism’s dependence on the type of load applied. Piles governed by axial compression with relatively minor moment were observed to be more sensitive to bond. The moment dominated loads required more surface to surface pressure transfer or bearing. Further investigation is recommended to determine the bond characteristics of steel fully encased by concrete. Advisor: Joshua Steelma...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} project concerns the construction, testing, and remote health {{monitoring of the}} first smart bridge structure in Florida, the East Bay bridge in Gibsonton, Hillsborough County. The East Bay Bridge is a four span, continuous, deck-type structure with a total length of 1202 ̆ 7 and width of 552 ̆ 7. The superstructure consists of an 182 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 cast-in-place reinforced concrete slab, and is supported on pre-stressed <b>pile</b> <b>bents,</b> each consisting of 5 piles. The smart sensors used for remote health monitoring are the newly emerged Fabry [...] Perot (FP) Fiber Optic Sensors, and are both surface-mounted and embedded in the concrete deck. Static and Dynamic testing of the bridge were performed using loaded SU- 4 trucks, and a finite element model for the bridge was developed for the test cases using commercial software packages. In addition, the smart sensors were connected to a data acquisition system permanently installed on-site. This system could be accessed through regular phone lin es, which permits {{the evaluation of the}} bridge behavior under live traffic loads. Currently, these live structural data under traffic loading are transmitted to Hillsborough County 2 ̆ 7 s bridge maintenance office to assist in the health evaluation and maintenance of the bridge. AASHTO LRFD Design Code has been investigated using analytical and laboratory test but no attempt has been made to verify its relative outlook with respect to Allowable Strength Design (ASD) and AASHTO Standard Specifications (LFD) in a real field test. The likely reason for could have been the lack of accurate and reliable sensing systems. The data collected as well as the analytical studies through out this research, suggest that current LRFD design specifications for deck-type bridges are conservative. The technology developed under this work will enable practical, cost-effective, and reliable systematic maintenance of bridge structures, and the study will provide a unique opportunity for future growth of this tech nology in the state of Florida and in other states and finally, long term collected data can be used to keep the design codes in check...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{treats the}} {{buckling}} of slender piles completely embedded in soft cohesive soils.

It is shown that an ideally straight, centrally loaded pile does notbuckle until the stresses in the pile material exceed the elastic range. The shape of the pile axis, however, is mostimportant. Only a very little deviation from a straight line, because the <b>pile</b> is <b>bent</b> elastically or stressles, causesa rapid decrease of the maximum pile-load in dependency of the shear resistance of the soils with the increase ofthe deviation.

40|$|The {{increasing}} failure {{potential of}} U.

This study focuses on computationally efficient coupled bridge-soil-foundation (CBSF) analyses and develops fragility curves for multi-span continuous steel bridges (MSCS) typical of the central and eastern U.

The resulting fragility curves show {{an increase in the}} vulnerability of rocker bearings and <b>bent</b> <b>piles.</b> Moreover, {{depending on the type of}} soil layer overlying the liquefiable sand, liquefaction either decreases or increases the fragility of columns, whereas the probability of unseating at the abutments increases when liquefaction is explicitly modeled.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{quantify}} the influence of temperature changes on integral abutment bridge movements, thirty-two Sokkia RS 30 N reflective targets were strategically attached to a bridge along its length. These targets were surveyed every month for twelve consecutive months. These changes in length coincided with restraint conditions between purely fixed and simply supported. Movement of expansion joints was also recorded. The movements of the expansion gaps at opposite corners appear to exhibit similar movements. This behavior indicates a type of twisting motion occurring within the bridge {{as a result of}} unequal movements at the east and west sides of each abutment. This motion suggests that the bridge abutments experience forces that incite weak axis bending in the abutments, especially in the north abutment. These quantitative bridge movements were compared to predicted behavior from a finite-element model. A detailed finite-element model of the bridge was created using SAP 2000 (Computers and Structures, Inc.) software. The detailed model was developed using solid elements for all components of the bridge except <b>piles</b> and <b>bents.</b> Longitudinal surface springs were placed at the abutment elements in order to simulate the soil-abutment interaction. A typical temperature load was assigned to the bridge deck and girder elements to compare the calculated stress concentrations in the model with the observed cracking on the abutment. The model produced high stress concentrations in the abutment adjacent to the bottom girder flange. This corresponded to the same location of observed cracking. The finite-element model also showed lateral movement of the north abutment. This lateral abutment contributed to the unequal movements of the bridge spans. Once the comparison between the measured bridge behavior of the survey and the findings of the detailed finite element model was completed, a simplified model was used to evaluate the bending moment and stresses in the abutment of the 400 South Street Bridge. The simplified model was also used to perform a parametric study on the influence of skew, span length, and temperature gradient on weak-axis abutment moments...|$|R
5000|$|The {{unofficial}} {{start of}} the series was in 1973 in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina. A group of drivers began racing on a road course owned by former NASCAR Cup owner Bill Ellis. Ellis decided not to continue after a few races. The drivers decided to format an association called the Baby Grand National Racing Association, Inc. (BGNRA), and appointed Charlie Triplett as president. Triplett says the name stemmed from the cars' resemblance to the Grand National (now Sprint Cup) cars of the era, as paint schemes and numbers often matched those from Grand National cars. The series was originally a touring series of 4-cylinder compact sedan cars. The slogan for the series was [...] "The Poor Man's Way to Race." [...] The founder turned to NASCAR to begin sanctioning the series in 1975. The series flourished with the relatively inexpensive cars and motors. It was not uncommon for forty drivers to enter an event. Five-time champion Dean Combs used a Datsun 200 SX in the 1980 season, {{and became the first}} NASCAR driver to 'regularly' compete in a foreign-made car. Contrary to popular belief, foreign cars had competed in NASCAR competition {{in the early days of}} the sanctioning body; indeed, a Jaguar won a NASCAR-sanctioned race in the Grand National division (predecessor to the modern Sprint Cup Series) at a road course in Linden, New Jersey in 1954, according to commentator Mike Joy, and the last foreign-made car to compete in a NASCAR-sanctioned event was an MG at one Grand National race in 1963 (before Toyota entered the Nextel Cup Series at the beginning of the 2007 season.) Now called ISCARS DASH Touring, the series is still a great place for young drivers to gain valuable experience competing against seasoned veterans like Danny Bagwell, Geoff Bodine, Johnny Chapman, Jake and Justin Hobgood all of which have experience at the top levels of NASCAR. 1986 Daytona 500 Champion Geoffrey Bodine joined the circuit in 2008 to compete in the final four events. ISCARS plans to highlight Bodine's involvement as part of an extensive driver development program. Bagwell is well known for a destructive accident in '99 at Daytona when the vehicle hit the wall and tumbled repeatedly. It ended up upside down, the engine was gone, all the wheels were out, the windshield, and the sheetmetal distinagrated. All that was left was a <b>pile</b> of <b>bent</b> safety bars. Also in this series was the only car ever to careen into Lake Lloyd, Dave Stacey in 1994.|$|R

To secure rapid implementation of Load Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) principles for foundation design, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) are requiring their use through AASHTO code. The Bridge Section of the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) has responsibility for satisfactory design {{of all the}} bridge structures across the state’s highway system. The widespread geotechnical adoption of the LRFD code throughout state DOTs has been difficult {{in the case of}} deep foundations due to regional differences and in some cases a lack of any close match to DOT foundation practices. This lack of matching stems from the source research conducted on which the code is based, documented as NCHRP 507. For ODOT, the evaluation of nominal axial static capacity for each driven pile in the field is conducted by dynamic methods and AASHTO offers resistance factors for these techniques. ODOT typically uses the wave equation software (WEAP) applied at the end of initial driving, EOID, and occasionally at the beginning of pile restrike (BOR) to capture increases in capacity from set-up. This study reports that, based on past and new surveys, ODOT practice is reasonably typical for DOT practice in sands, silts, and clays. The AASHTO resistance factor, φ, for WEAP is at EOID and is too low for the efficient design of piles to match the likely probabilities of pile failure. The survey of Northwest state DOTs revealed that 80 % of the DOTs believe that a φ of 0. 4 is conservative and 37. 5 % do not use the AASHTO-sanctioned φ of 0. 4. Matching LRFD to allowable stress design (ASD) by direct calibration for a single pile, without any reported capacity bias, sets φ as 0. 55 to match the ASD factor of safety of 2. 5. An ODOT case history of a recently completed pilesupported bridge designed and constructed to FHWA and AASHTO ASD standards in use at that time, shows the number of <b>piles</b> at the <b>bent</b> studied would be doubled under new AASHTO requirements. This suggests the standard will add considerable pile foundation costs to all new bridges. This cost increase is a strong incentive to complete statistical recalibration of GRLWEAP dynamic capacity resistance value in a Phase 2 of this study...|$|R
