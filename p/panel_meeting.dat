500|$|The opening {{months of}} Newcastle's 2008–09 season were blighted by {{ownership}} and managerial turmoil, {{as well as}} numerous injury problems. This manifested itself on the pitch as the club struggled to direct itself clear of the relegation zone. However a highlight was Given saving a Kevin Nolan penalty in a 1–0 win over Bolton Wanderers. On 2 January 2009, following the 5–1 defeat at home against Liverpool, the player's lawyer released {{a statement saying that}} his client was [...] "considering his future" [...] at Newcastle, and requested permission to talk to representatives of Manchester City on 28 January after the club made a bid of £5million which was subsequently rejected. Newcastle manager Joe Kinnear had already stated that the club was [...] "not interested at all in selling him", and described the amount on offer for Given as [...] "insulting". However, on 30 January, it was reported that Newcastle had given permission for Given to enter talks with his suitors. After a transfer fee initially reported to be around £8million was agreed between the clubs, Given signed for Manchester City on 1 February, with the transfer window set to close the following day. The news was disappointing for Newcastle fans who felt that Given left the club in a poor situation with many thinking that had Given delayed his decision to leave until the summer, Newcastle would have subsequently survived relegation to the Championship because Given was such a fantastic goalkeeper who could have stopped many of the goals that the Toon conceded {{towards the end of the}} dreadful campaign. Although the fee for Given was expected to be around £8million, in February 2009 Newcastle United managing director Derek Llambias revealed at a supporters <b>panel</b> <b>meeting</b> that Given had been sold for an initial £5.9million. Given was 34 games away from breaking Newcastle United's appearance record held by Jimmy Lawrence.|$|E

When they were not designated reviewers, however, they played a markedly greater role and their discussion focused more on consent disclosures than other reviewers.

40|$|Improving {{the quality}} of obstetric care is an urgent {{priority}} in developing countries, where maternal mortality remains high. The feasibility of criterion-based clinical audit of the assessment and management of five major obstetric complications is being studied in Ghana and Jamaica. In order to establish case definitions and clinical audit criteria, a systematic {{review of the literature}} was followed by three expert <b>panel</b> <b>meetings.</b> A modified nominal group technique was used to develop consensus among experts on a final set of case definitions and criteria. Five main obstetric complications were selected and definitions were agreed. The literature review led to the identification of 67 criteria, and the <b>panel</b> <b>meetings</b> resulted in the modification and approval of 37 of these for the next stage of audit. Criterion-based audit, which has been devised and tested primarily in industrialized countries, can be adapted and applied where resources are poorer. The selection of audit criteria for such settings requires local expert opinion to be considered in addition to research evidence, so as to ensure that the criteria are realistic in relation to conditions in the field. Practical methods for achieving this are described in the present paper...|$|R
