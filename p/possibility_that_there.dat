5|$|From an {{analysis}} of coastal deposits near Bundala in the Hambantota district in Sri Lanka, paleontologists have gathered secure evidence of prehistoric fauna in Sri Lanka by 125,000 BP. Excavations of the area have also yielded tools of quartz and chert probably belonging to the Middle Palaeolithic period. Consequently, some believe in the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were prehistoric humans in Sri Lanka from 500,000 BP or earlier, and consider it likely that {{they were on the}} island by 300,000 BP. Further analysis of ancient coastal sands in the north and south east of the island may yield evidence of such early hominids.|$|E
5|$|Nineteen {{bodies were}} burned beyond recognition, {{but none of}} them {{appeared}} to be women or children, according to Pakistani officials. An article in The Nation, cited a grave digger at the cemetery where the bodies were being buried, who claimed there was the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> may have been more than one body in each coffin. The article also stated that the government was digging more graves than previously established. The Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, a coalition of hard-line religious parties, claimed that between 400 and 1,000 students had been killed, along with women and children. Spanish-language news channels Univision, Antena 3, and Telecinco claimed that the total number of deaths in the siege was greater than 286 and could be as high as 300.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Planck, Einstein {{entertained the}} <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> might be actual {{physical}} quanta of light—what {{we now call}} photons. He noticed that a light quantum with energy proportional to its frequency would explain a number of troubling puzzles and paradoxes, including an unpublished law by Stokes, the ultraviolet catastrophe, and the photoelectric effect. Stokes's law said simply that the frequency of fluorescent light cannot be greater than {{the frequency of the}} light (usually ultraviolet) inducing it. Einstein eliminated the ultraviolet catastrophe by imagining a gas of photons behaving like a gas of electrons that he had previously considered. He was advised by a colleague to be careful how he wrote up this paper, in order to not challenge Planck, a powerful figure in physics, too directly, and indeed the warning was justified, as Planck never forgave him for writing it.|$|E
30|$|They’re also {{consistent}} with the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>there’s</b> actually some skill involved.

It’s quite possible <b>that</b> <b>there’s</b> an experiment <b>that</b> we’ve got somebody who knows how to experiment. The complication for evolutionary theory, in reality, is we have breeders who keep intervening and producing new species or changing species. They do that intentionally, deliberately, and they change the world. We sometimes do it unintentionally, the nice evolutionary theory really works better without people who are screwing it up by breeding. The same thing is probably true in the world of management.|$|R

25|$|Perhaps the Fermi paradox itself—or {{the alien}} {{equivalent}} of it—is {{the reason for}} any civilization to avoid contact with other civilizations, even if no other obstacles existed. From any one civilization's point of view, it would be unlikely {{for them to be}} the first ones to make first contact. Therefore, according to this reasoning, it is likely that previous civilizations faced fatal problems with first contact and doing so should be avoided. So perhaps every civilization keeps quiet because of the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a real reason for others to do so.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{ground-breaking}} work of Brenda Milner, Suzanne Corkin {{and others}} studying the amnesiac patient Henry Molaison, researchers {{had assumed that}} memory was an emergent property of the cerebral cortex or brain as a whole. Because of H.M., they began to explore the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were multiple memory systems in the brain: different types of learning and memory that were supported by mechanisms in different areas.

25|$|Odell {{discovered}} {{the first evidence}} which might reveal something about the climb of Mallory and Irvine among the equipment in camps V and VI.

25|$|In 1903, Riazanov {{became the}} first writer to {{introduce}} the concept of permanent revolution to the political literature of Russian Marxism when he published three studies in Geneva under the title Materials on the Program of the Workers' Party. Riazanov argued, {{in opposition to the}} views of G.V. Plekhanov, that the rise of capitalism in Russia represented a fundamental departure from the pattern seen elsewhere in Europe. The large size and centralization of Russian industrial firms suggested to Riazanov a relative weakness of Russian middle-classes and a significant <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> would be forces of the Russian Marxist movement which would lead the revolution against Tsarist autocracy and thenceforth immediately towards socialism.|$|E
25|$|Mugabe and {{the victorious}} black nationalists were rather less {{concerned}} by Operation Quartz {{than by the}} <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> might be a mass exodus of the white community {{of the kind that}} had caused chaos in Mozambique five years earlier.

30|$|We {{focus on}} the {{publication}} trajectory of individuals within select high-impact journals, acknowledging that {{it is likely to}} reflect factors beyond just the inherent citation impact of his/her average research output. One <b>possibility</b> is <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no significant change in the citation impact of a researcher’s publications over time. A second <b>possibility</b> is <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is an increase in the citation impact with each subsequent publication. This increasing trend is consistent with a researcher being able to leverage prior success to improve their research resources [29] and to leverage reputation within the community to increase their base citation rate [26]. A third scenario is a decrease in the citation impact over time. This negative trend is consistent with an opportunity premium that is provided to accomplished scientists via cumulative advantage, such that new opportunities arrive at effectively a ‘lower cost’ than the base ‘entry cost’.|$|R
25|$|The AMY1 gene {{copy number}} {{has been found}} to be {{correlated}} to different levels of starch in diets of different populations. 8 Populations from different continents were categorized into high starch diets and low starch diets and their AMY1 gene copy number was visualized using high resolution FISH and qPCR. It was found that the high starch diet populations which consists of the Japanese, Hadza, and European American populations had a significantly higher (2 times higher) average AMY1 copy number than the low starch diet populations including Biaka, Mbuti, Datog, Yakut populations. It was hypothesized that the levels of starch in one’s regular diet, the substrate for AMY1, can directly affect the copy number of the AMY1 gene. Since it was concluded that the copy number of AMY1 is directly correlated with salivary amylase, the more starch present in the population’s daily diet, the more evolutionarily favorable it is to have multiple copies of the AMY1 gene. The AMY1 gene was the first gene to provide strong evidence for evolution on a molecular genetics level. Moreover, using comparative genomic hybridization, copy number variations of the entire genomes of the Japanese population was compared to that of the Yakut population. It was found that the copy number variation of the AMY1 gene was significantly different from the copy number variation in other genes or regions of the genome, suggesting that the AMY1 gene was under a strong selective pressure that had little or no influence on the other copy number variations. Finally, the variability of length of 783 microsatellites between the two populations were compared to copy number variability of the AMY1 gene. It was found that the AMY1 gene copy number range was larger than that of over 97% of the microsatellites examined. This implies that natural selection played a considerable role in shaping the average number of AMY1 genes in these two populations. However, as only 6 populations were studied, it is important to consider the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> may be other factors in their diet or culture that influenced the AMY1 copy number other than starch.|$|E
500|$|In 1975, the Columbia album The Basement Tapes was compiled, {{mainly by}} Robertson and {{engineer}} Rob Fraboni. Robertson and Fraboni put thirty-five {{of the songs}} onto composite reels of tape, and Heylin believes these represented {{a short list of}} candidates for the album. [...] "Santa-Fe" [...] was included on these composite reels, but was not ultimately chosen for the album. The Basement Tapes included sixteen Dylan songs recorded at Big Pink in 1967, as well as eight Band demos from various times and locations between 1967 and 1975. One Dylan song on the album, [...] "Goin' to Acapulco", had not appeared on his 1967 fourteen-song acetate or on bootlegs, and this alerted the world to the <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> might be more Basement Tape songs in existence. In 1986, at least twenty-five previously unknown 1967 songs by Dylan and the Band passed into collectors' hands by way of a former roadie of the Band's. In the early 1990s, a third batch of songs, these ones from Garth Hudson's archives, came to light around the time Columbia was preparing The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3; [...] "Santa-Fe" [...] comes from this group. In his liner notes for The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3, John Bauldie commented on these second and third stages in which groups of Big Pink songs had come to light: [...] "Despite the... emergence [...] in collectors' circles of a further couple of hours of Basement Tapes, it seems as though there's a good deal left unheard. 'Santa-Fe' is just one example of a batch of previously unsuspected Basement tracks". By 1992, the [...] "Santa-Fe" [...] batch of songs had been obtained by bootleggers, and almost all known Dylan Basement Tape songs were assembled onto the 5-CD bootleg The Genuine Basement Tapes.
