50|$|Tracy {{arrived in}} Port Charles in 1978 as the scheming {{daughter}} of Edward and Lila Quartermaine for Alan and Monica's wedding. A divorcee {{with a young}} son, Ned (off in boarding school), Tracy felt Monica was beneath them although she did grow to respect Monica as a physician. Determined to always {{be the center of}} attention at social functions, Tracy flirted with many of the men she met, although most of them were already involved in other relationships. Edward and Lila shed light on their daughter's character to Monica at a Thanksgiving gathering, warning her that Tracy would be ruthless in her attempts to hold onto her grandfather's trust fund for her son. Despite often friendly encounters with Monica, Tracy was determined to <b>prevent</b> any <b>male</b> <b>children</b> of Monica's from getting their hands on the trust fund. This was fueled by her discovery that Monica was having an affair with Monica's first love, Rick Webber. Her mission was to determine that Monica's unborn child was indeed not a Quartermaine heir, but rather a Webber heir. This was a problem as both Monica and Rick were married to other people at the time, Monica to Alan, and Rick to Lesley Williams. When Monica was injured falling down the stairs in the Quartermaine mansion and had to spend the remainder of her pregnancy in bed, Tracy visited her with a peace offering, and told her that she was praying for Monica's unborn child, which she hoped was a girl. But when tests proved otherwise, Tracy's schemes went into high gear, although she was concerned about Monica and the soon to be born baby when Monica was trapped at the mansion during a snowstorm with only Lesley Webber, Gail Baldwin and the Quartermaine housekeeper, Stella Fields, to aide her during labor. But once this crisis was over and Monica returned home, Tracy's schemes to prove that Rick was the father became more aggressive, causing the rivalry between the two women to explode into war.|$|R

40|$|PhD (Psychology), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Boys {{in their}} middle {{childhood}} placed in clinic schools experience severe emotional and behavioural problems. Most of these boys have been sexually abused. The trauma of this sexual abuse {{may contribute to}} their problem behaviour. If the learners can be effectively supported in addressing {{the trauma of the}} <b>male</b> <b>child</b> sexual abuse during their time at the clinic school, some of their emotional and behavioural problems may also be addressed. Without these emotional and behavioural problems {{they may be able to}} develop without hindrance of the <b>male</b> <b>child</b> sexual abuse and may be integrated into the mainstream educational setting before they reach the age of twelve years. This study consisted of three phases. During the first phase the experiences of seven sexually abused boys placed in clinic schools in Gauteng Province in South Africa were explored in order to develop a better understanding of their support needs. It was achieved by means of three in-depth interviews with each participant. For the purpose of the first phase a qualitative design was used, which was of a phenomenological, descriptive and exploratory nature in order to explore and describe the phenomenon of <b>male</b> <b>child</b> sexual abuse. To obtain a clear picture of the unique view and subjective experiences of a participant in a clinic school, the phenomenon of <b>male</b> <b>child</b> sexual abuse was investigated. From the results it was clear that sexually abused boys placed in clinic schools exhibit intensified emotional reactions, as well as certain problems associated with <b>male</b> <b>child</b> sexual abuse. The intensified emotional reactions include a deep sense of sadness and helplessness, a sense of guilt and shame, a sense of dissociation and numbness, avoidance of situations associated with <b>male</b> <b>child</b> sexual abuse, fear of recurring incidents and the re-experiencing of the trauma. The problems associated with <b>male</b> <b>child</b> sexual abuse include concerns regarding their own sexuality, difficulties in interacting with other people, dealing with anger and aggression, displaying self-destructive behaviour and difficulties to cope with schoolwork. During the second phase of the study twenty-four psychologists, social workers, counsellors, teachers and child and youth care workers were included. Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with each of them to identify critical aspects to support victims of <b>male</b> <b>child</b> sexual abuse. For the purpose of the second phase the interpretive descriptive design was used. The results suggest that the following critical aspects should be considered in the conceptualisation of a proposed support strategy: Relationships as basis for support; strengthening the <b>male</b> <b>child</b> sexual abuse victims to deal with behavioural and emotional challenges; facilitating the safety of the <b>male</b> <b>child</b> sexual abuse victims to avoid continued exposure to abuse; providing a structured environment and coordinated support efforts to ensure sustainability. The third phase of this study consisted of the conceptualisation of a support strategy for <b>male</b> <b>child</b> sexual abuse victims. Two focus groups were conducted with fourteen psychologists, social workers, counsellors, teachers and child and youth care workers to conceptualise the support strategy. The proposed support strategy suggests the incorporation of different role players in a collaborative team approach for a multilevel support approach. The proposed support strategy involves three main facets, namely strengthening of the <b>male</b> <b>child</b> sexual abuse victim as an individual, sustaining a deep/trusting relationship, as well as the facilitation of a supportive context for the <b>male</b> <b>child</b> sexual abuse victim.

40|$|Assessment of {{skeletal}} {{maturity and}} dental {{development is a}} common clinical practice in many health professions. Aims of this investigation were: 1) to test {{the applicability of the}} Demirjian 46 method and the Greulich and Pyle 47 atlas to the Saudi <b>male</b> <b>children.</b> 2) to study the relationship between dental maturity, skeletal maturity and chronological age in Saudi <b>male</b> <b>children,</b> and 3) to study the association between the dental maturity markers and the skeletal maturity stages in Saudi <b>male</b> <b>children.</b> Materials and Methods: The sample consisted of panoramic and hand-wrist radiographs of 148 Saudi <b>male</b> <b>children</b> between 9 and 15 years of age. Demirjian 46 method was used to estimate the dental age through the assessment of different calcification stages of the left mandibular dentition. Skeletal age was determined using Greulich and Pyle 47 atlas and skeletal maturity stage was established utilizing Björk’s 21 skeletal maturity indicators. Results: Paired sample T-test revealed {{no significant difference between the}} mean dental, skeletal and chronological age. Tendency toward late skeletal maturation and early dental maturation was observed. Spearman rank order test showed high correlation between skeletal maturity markers and dental maturity markers of the 1 st premolar (r= 0. 729) and 2 nd molar (r= 0. 720). Conclusion: chronological age is a reasonable indicator of the dental and skeletal maturation in Saudi <b>male</b> <b>children.</b> The dental maturation stage of the left mandibular 1 st premolar and 2 nd molar can be used to predict the skeletal maturity stage in Saudi <b>male</b> <b>children.</b> The skeletal maturity rate of Saudi <b>male</b> <b>children</b> is analogous to previously reported rates in other groups with different ethnic backgrounds.

The findings provide an interesting and persuasive case to further examine online strategies used by persons wishing to exploit <b>male</b> <b>children,</b> as it highlights potential differences in approaches when compared with interactions between suspected offenders and female children. The differences include less aggressive online behaviour and language, with an emphasis on the <b>male</b> <b>child’s</b> sexuality and sexual experience. These strategies appear to assist the formation of an online friendship which precedes sexual topics, rather than the reverse as is largely reported in literature. These findings are likely to have implications for law enforcement and child protection initiatives...|$|R

We conducted a cross-sectional study among heterosexual HIV serodiscordant couples (a population {{at high risk for}} HIV transmission) attending a research clinic in Kampala, Uganda on perceptions and attitudes about medical circumcision for <b>male</b> <b>children</b> for HIV prevention. Correlates of willingness to circumcise <b>male</b> <b>children</b> were assessed using generalized estimating equations methods. 318 HIV serodiscordant couples were interviewed, 51. 3 % in which the female partner was HIV uninfected. Most couples were married and cohabiting, and almost 50 % had at least one uncircumcised <b>male</b> <b>child</b> of ≤ 18 years of age. Overall, 90. 2 % of male partners and 94. 6 % of female partners expressed interest in medical circumcision for their <b>male</b> <b>children</b> for reduction of future risk for HIV infection, including 79. 9 % of men and 87. 6 % of women who had an uncircumcised <b>male</b> <b>child.</b> Among both men and women, those who were knowledgeable that circumcision reduces men's risk for HIV (adjusted prevalence ratio [APR] 1. 34 and 1. 14) and those who had discussed the HIV prevention effects of medical circumcision with their partner (APR 1. 08 and 1. 07) were significantly (p≤ 0. 05) more likely to be interested in <b>male</b> <b>child</b> circumcision for HIV prevention.
