40|$|The first {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop a model where <b>provision</b> <b>to</b> a common property resources (CPR) depends on the level of cooperation in appropriation. The second objective is to propose a model that links <b>provision</b> <b>to</b> the quality of cooperation in appropriation when there are negative externalities in appropriation and the third objective is to show how this model can be constructed. Topics of discussion includes linking <b>provision</b> <b>to</b> cooperation, linking cooperation in appropriation <b>to</b> <b>provision,</b> and joint determination of provision and appropriation...|$|R

5|$|From {{the time}} of the battle until several months later, almost all Allied {{supplies}} and reinforcements sent to Guadalcanal came by transports in small convoys, mainly during daylight hours, while Allied aircraft from the New Hebrides and Henderson Field and any available aircraft carriers flew covering missions. During this time, Allied forces on Guadalcanal received barely enough ammunition and <b>provisions</b> <b>to</b> withstand the several Japanese drives to retake the islands.|$|E
5|$|From the well-fortified {{position}} in the Klis Fortress, the Turks were a constant threat to the Venetians and to the local Croatian population in the surrounding area. In 1647, after the Turkish success at Novigrad, the Turks {{were said to have}} 30,000 troops ready to attack Split. The Signoria send off two thousand soldiers with munitions and <b>provisions</b> <b>to</b> the threatened area. Although Split and Zadar were strong fortresses, they were clearly in danger.|$|E

5|$|Built {{as a local}} station, {{the station}} was {{constructed}} with bellmouth <b>provisions</b> <b>to</b> allow conversion into an express station. A close observation of both ends of this station reveals that the tunnel wall extends outward to allow space for the two side platforms to be replaced with island platforms, with the local tracks taking the side platforms' place. The station would have accommodated a major system expansion, with additional service coming from the Roosevelt Avenue Terminal station and the former LIRR Rockaway Line. Requests to convert the station were also put forward by the local community shortly after the station opened, due to heavy bus traffic feeding into the station and overcrowding at the Roosevelt Avenue express stop.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{strained}} {{relationship between}} Kennedy and Bush over No Child Left Behind spending, the two attempted {{to work together}} again on extending Medicare to cover prescription drug benefits. Kennedy's strategy was again doubted by other Democrats, but he saw the proposed $400billion program as an opportunity {{that should not be}} missed. However, when the final formulation of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act contained <b>provisions</b> <b>to</b> steer seniors towards private plans, Kennedy switched to opposing it. It passed in late 2003, and led Kennedy to again say he had been betrayed by the Bush administration.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the delay}} in ratifying the Lisbon Treaty, the seventh {{parliament}} was elected under the lower Nice Treaty cap. A small scale treaty amendment was ratified on 29 November 2011. This amendment brought in transitional <b>provisions</b> <b>to</b> allow the 18 additional MEPs created under the Lisbon Treaty to be elected or appointed before the 2014 election. Under the Lisbon Treaty reforms, Germany was the only state to lose members from 99 to 96. However, these seats were not removed until the 2014 election.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{perceived}} of {{collaborating with}} the enemy have, on occasion, been impaled. For example, in 1632 during the Thirty Years' War, the German officer Fuchs was impaled on suspicion of defecting to the Swedes, a Swedish corporal was likewise impaled for trying to defect to the Germans. In 1654, under the Ottoman siege of the Venetian garrison at Crete, several peasants were impaled for supplying <b>provisions</b> <b>to</b> the besieged. Likewise in 1685, some Christians were impaled by the Hungarians for having provided supplies to the Turks.|$|E
5|$|Johnson helped {{organize}} a mechanics' (working men's) ticket in the 1829 Greeneville municipal election. He was elected town alderman, {{along with his}} friends Blackston McDannel and Mordecai Lincoln. Following the 1831 Nat Turner slave rebellion, a state convention was called to pass a new constitution, including <b>provisions</b> <b>to</b> disenfranchise free people of color. The convention also wanted to reform real estate tax rates, and provide ways of funding improvements to Tennessee's infrastructure. The constitution was submitted for a public vote, and Johnson spoke widely for its adoption; the successful campaign provided him with statewide exposure. On January 4, 1834, his fellow aldermen elected him mayor of Greeneville.|$|E

One of these—on 9 October—landed General Hyakutake on the island to personally lead the Japanese forces in the planned offensive. Mikawa also sent heavy cruisers on several occasions to bombard Henderson Field. On the night of 11 October, one of these bombardment missions was intercepted by U.S. naval forces and defeated in the Battle of Cape Esperance.|$|E

Section 4(1) establishes a general duty to repair and maintain the property, owed by the landlord to anyone who could reasonably {{be expected to be}} harmed by a breach; this includes tenants, their friends and family and also trespassers. This duty applies when a landlord ought to have known of a defect, not just when he has been informed of a defect. Additionally, a landlord who merely has the right to repair property rather than an obligation to do so may still be found liable, if one of the groups described in Section 4 was harmed by their failure to repair.|$|E

5|$|The {{commander}} of Fort Sumter, South Carolina, Major Robert Anderson, sent {{a request for}} <b>provisions</b> <b>to</b> Washington, and the execution of Lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists {{as an act of}} war. On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops at Fort Sumter, forcing them to surrender, and began the war. Historian Allan Nevins argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South, and not realizing the Southern Unionists were insisting there be no invasion.|$|E
5|$|The first agreement, {{signed on}} 14 September 1937, {{included}} plans to counterattack aggressive submarines. Naval patrols were established; the United Kingdom and France were to patrol {{most of the}} western Mediterranean {{and parts of the}} east, and the other signatories were to patrol their own waters. Italy was to be allowed to join the agreement and patrol the Tyrrhenian Sea if it wished. A second agreement followed three days later, applying similar <b>provisions</b> <b>to</b> surface ships. Italy and Germany did not attend, although the former took up naval patrols in November. In marked contrast to the actions of the Non-Intervention Committee and the League of Nations, this conference succeeded in preventing attacks by submarines.|$|E
