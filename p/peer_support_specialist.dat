40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to explore the experiences and utilization of Certified <b>Peer</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Specialists</b> employed on Dialectical Behavior Therapy teams. Trends in the literature regarding <b>peer</b> <b>support</b> include the challenges faced by <b>Peer</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Specialists,</b> the benefits <b>peers</b> gained by employment, and solutions for ongoing peer program development. There is also an abundance of studies supporting the use of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) for treating Borderline Personality Disorder and other DBT adaptations for specific populations. Currently, there is limited literature available that discusses the training of line staff in DBT and no published studies that discuss the use of Certified <b>Peer</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Specialists</b> (CPSS’s) on DBT teams specifically. The State of Michigan mandates that DBT teams include a CPSS. Data were collected {{through the use of}} in-depth key informant interviews with thirteen CPSS’s working on DBT teams throughout Michigan. A thematic analysis was completed on the resultant transcripts. The analysis identified four salient themes that include: 1) the benefits of CPSS’s employment on themselves and their clients, 2) the challenges CPSS’s face, 3) the responsibilities and functions of those roles being filled by the CPSS’s, and 4) the supervision and support provided to CPSS’s. Further research on this topic is encouraged and this study recommends how CPSS’s can be used on DBT teams...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Integrating {{the best}} {{available}} evidence into program standards is essential if system-wide improvements {{in the delivery of}} community-based mental health services are to be achieved. Since the beginning of the Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) program movement, program standards have included a role for the community. In particular, ACT program standards have sought to ensure that members of the local community are involved in governance and that former clients participate in service delivery as "Peer Support Specialists". This paper reports {{on the extent to which}} ACT program standards related to community participation have been implemented and identifies barriers to full compliance. Methods Qualitative and quantitative data were collected through a telephone survey of ACT Program Coordinators in Ontario, Canada, using a census sample of the existing 66 ACT programs. A thematic approach to content analysis was used to analyze respondents' qualitative comments. Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS 16. 0 and included means, frequencies, independent t-tests and Pearson Correlations. Results An 85 % response rate was achieved. Of the 33 program standards, the two that received the lowest perceived compliance ratings were the two standards directly concerning community participation. Specifically, the standard to have a functioning Community Advisory Body and the standard requiring the inclusion of a <b>Peer</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Specialist.</b> The three major themes that emerged from the survey data with respect to the barriers to fully implementing the Community Advisory Body were: external issues; standard related issues; and, organizational/structural related issues. The three major themes concerning barriers to implementing the <b>Peer</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Specialist</b> role were: human resource related issues; organizational/structural related issues; and, standard related issues. Conclusions The reasons for low compliance of ACT programs with community participation standards are complex and are tied to structural and human resources barriers (both internal and external to the ACT programs) as well as to the requirements of the standards themselves. In order for improvements to the mental health system to be achieved there is a need to identify and address these barriers. Failure to do so will result in less than optimal client, family and economic efficiency outcomes. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to better {{understand}} the self-care practices of female <b>peer</b> <b>support</b> <b>specialists</b> (PSS) with co-occurring mood and substance use disorders. The researcher took a qualitative grounded theory approach conducting in-depth semi-structured interviews with ten women employed at peer-run agencies in Maricopa County, Arizona. Data from these interviews were transcribed, then analyzed manually, as well as with NVivo 10. 0 software, to identify the key terms, nodes, categories and emergent themes of the participants' experiences. Self-care practices of <b>peer</b> <b>support</b> <b>specialists</b> included accessing personal and professional support networks; maintaining a daily routine to balance the demands of recovery, parenting, and working; taking medications; sleeping; practicing spirituality; participating in service work; eating nutritiously; exercising, and building a sense of coherence. Although a variety of practices were being used and identified as helpful, spirituality was identified as the most important self-care practice to achieve overall wellness. Employment improved the ability for PSSs to practice self-care because they valued the support of their supervisors and coworkers, were reminded of the consequences of not practicing self-care by working with individuals who were unstable, gained knowledge from teaching others, found healing in telling their stories, and reported higher self-esteems from working and helping others. However, participants did identify ways that employment as a PSS could interfere with practicing self-care, such as staff turnover, limited access to supervisors, or being unprepared to work in the field. Several recommendations were suggested as a result of this study, such as the importance of understanding and using effective self-care practices, building personal and professional support networks, and establishing daily routines to balance recovery with personal and professional demands...|$|R

40|$|Community support {{programs}} are increasingly establishing paid service positions designated exclusively for consumers.

Critical commentary addressed program operations (structure, supervision, and training needs) and problems in the mental health system.

40|$|This book {{offers a}} {{clinical}} guide that brings together {{a broad range}} of brief interventions and their applications in treating psychosis. It describes two core approaches that can narrow the current, substantial gap between the need for psychotherapeutic interventions for all individuals suffering from psychosis, and the limited mental health resources available. The first approach involves utilizing the standard therapeutic modalities in the context of routine clinical interactions after adapting them into brief and effective formats. To that end, the book brings in experts on various psychotherapeutic modalities, who discuss how their particular modality could be adapted to more effectively fit into the existing system of care delivery. The second approach, addressed in detail, is to extend the availability of these brief interventions by utilizing the circle of providers as well as the social circle of the clients so that these interventions can be provided in a coordinated and complementary manner by psychiatrists, psychologists, clinical social workers, case managers, <b>peer</b> <b>support</b> <b>specialists</b> and other providers on the one hand, and by family members, friends, social and religious institutions on the other...|$|R
