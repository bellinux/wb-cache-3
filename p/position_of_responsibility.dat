5|$|The February 1852 {{death of}} Prime Minister Rainiharo left the queen without her consort, long-time {{political}} adviser and military Commander-in-Chief. She consequently awarded Rainilaiarivony a double promotion to Twelfth Honor ten days afterward, {{in preparation for}} an increase in military and political responsibilities. Shortly thereafter the queen expressed romantic interest in Rainilaiarivony and proposed that he assume the former role of his father as prince consort and Prime Minister. The young man refused on the double basis of their age difference, the queen being forty years his senior, as well as the perceived impropriety of becoming intimate with his father's former lover. Ranavalona continued to harbor feelings for him throughout her lifetime but she did not express resentment over his refusal to reciprocate them and went on to take another high-ranking official as consort: Rainijohary, who was jointly awarded the role of Prime Minister along with the new Commander-in-Chief, Rainivoninahitriniony. Within a year the queen had assigned the 24-year-old Rainilaiarivony to his first <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> within the military, and promoted him to Royal Secretary, keeper of the Royal Seal, and supervisor to the Royal Treasurer.|$|E

Cowdery's deteriorating health did not allow him to accept this assignment, and within eight months he had died.|$|E

500|$|On April 17, a bulge (or [...] "cryptodome") was {{discovered}} on the mountain's north flank, suggesting that Mount St. Helens {{could produce a}} lateral blast. Johnston was one of few people who believed this, along with a professor of geology at a Tacoma community college, Jack Hyde. Observing that Mount St. Helens did not possess visible vents, Hyde suggested that pressure would increase until the mountain exploded. Because Hyde was {{not a part of}} the USGS or in a <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility,</b> his opinion was generally dismissed. However, both were to be proven correct. Rising magma under Mount St. Helens had veered off to the north flank, creating a growing bulge on the surface.|$|E
500|$|The {{structure}} of Dominican society was hierarchical, with strongly gendered roles. Rafael Trujillo, the ruler, was a cruel dictator who haunts {{the people of}} Santo Domingo even 35 years after his death. He is a true caudillo, ruling with brutality and corruption. He creates a personality cult in his capitalist society and encourages decadence within his regime. Prior to promotion to a <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility,</b> an officer is required to pass a [...] "test of loyalty". His people are to remain loyal to him all cost, and are periodically tested by public humiliation and censure even though acts of disloyalty were rare. Trujillo violates women and children {{as an expression of}} political and sexual power, and in some cases takes the wife or child of his lieutenants, many of whom still remain blindly loyal. Even the church and military institutions are employed to give women to the tyrant for pleasure.|$|E

During his tenure at Springfield, Dyer was responsible for expanding the output of small arms for the Union Army. Doubts {{about the wisdom of}} placing a southerner in such a <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> were rapidly dispelled as Dyer upgraded production with energy and dispatch. In 1862, Dyer was approached by his superiors concerning the possibility of his supplanting General Ripley as Chief of Ordnance, but he declined to take the assignment because he had great respect for his chief, and because he {{was in the middle of}} a major upgrading of weapons production at Springfield Armory.|$|E
2500|$|Today the {{complexion}} {{and aims}} of the 400-member strong Society are altered. Poland is itself once more, an independent if much altered, state within the EU. The Society meanwhile, [...] is in French terms, a charitable trust and co-owner with the government funded Academy of Learning in Poland, of an enormously valuable and fragile and unique asset, which it helps to run and for which it needs to raise funds. The asset is composed of real-estate but above all, the 19th and 20th-century fragments that bear testimony to a country literally torn apart with no certainty as to its future self-determination. To get to its current <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility,</b> dating only since 2004, the Society had to undergo a process of arbitration to reach heads of agreement with its partner owner. It contributes half the delegates {{that make up the}} governing council, otherwise known as the Association de la bibliothÃ¨que polonaise de Paris which steers the Library collections and the complement of associated museums and art collections, under the umbrella of the Polish Library in Paris. The current chairman is the distinguished nuclear physicist, Professor Kazimierz Lubicz-Zaleski.|$|E
2500|$|The duty of {{care was}} codified in the Trustee Act 2000 section 1, as the [...] "care and skill that is reasonable" [...] to expect, {{regarding}} any special skills of the trustee. In practice this means that a trustee must be judged by what should be reasonably expected from another person in such a <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility,</b> being mindful not to judge decisions {{with the benefit of}} hindsight, and mindful of the inherent risk involved in any property management venture. As long ago as 1678, in Morley v Morley Lord Nottingham LC held that a trustee would not be liable if Â£40 of the trust fund's gold was robbed, so long as he otherwise performed his duties. Probably one of the main parts of the {{duty of care}}, in managing trust property, will relate to a trustee's investment choices. In Learoyd v Whiteley, Lindley LJ elaborated the general prudent person rule, that in investments one must 'take such care as an ordinary prudent man would take if he were minded to make an investment for the benefit of other people for whom he felt morally bound to provide'. This meant a trustee who invested Â£5000 in mortgages of a brick field and four houses with a shop, and lost the lot when the businesses went insolvent, was liable for the losses on the brick field, whose value must have known to be bound to depreciate as bricks were taken out. Bartlett v Barclays Bank Trust Co Ltd suggests investments must be actively monitored, particularly by professional trustees. This duty was broken when the Barclays corporate trustee department, where trust assets held 99 per cent of a company's shares, failed to get any information or board representation before a disastrous property speculation. In making investments, TA 2000 section 4 requires that [...] "standard investment criteria" [...] must be observed, essentially along the lines of modern portfolio theory about diversification of investments to reduce risk. Section 5 suggests advice be sought on such matters if needed, but otherwise may invest anything that an ordinary property owner would. Additional restrictions, however, may be imposed depending on the how courts view the purpose of the trust, and the scope of a trustee's discretion.|$|E

The long period of confinement and suffering which she had endured seems to have exerted a very favorable influence upon her mind.
