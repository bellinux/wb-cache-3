40|$|A notable {{way that}} social change affects <b>personal</b> <b>quality</b> of life would {{rely on the}} person’s {{experience}} with social change. This experience may influence societal {{quality of life and}} quality of work life, which may in turn affect <b>personal</b> <b>quality</b> of life. Additionally, the experience of social change is possibly less detrimental to <b>personal</b> <b>quality</b> of life later in the presence of higher existing <b>personal</b> <b>quality</b> of life. These influences over time become transparent through a three-wave panel study of 531 working people in Hong Kong, China. Findings show that although social change experienced did not generally impair subsequent quality of life, it tended to be more detrimental to the person with lower quality of life before. In addition, social change experienced tended to erode societal quality of life and quality of work life experienced, which appeared to be predictors of <b>personal</b> <b>quality</b> of life. Hence, there are possible ways for social change to predict <b>personal</b> <b>quality</b> of life. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media B.

In line with the enhancement of <b>personal</b> <b>quality,</b> {{it has been estimated that}} internal locus of control would also amplify. This study examined the drivers of <b>personal</b> <b>quality</b> of corporate managers based on the examination of intelligence, emotional, and spiritual quotients (IESQ) and mediated by internal locus of control. Data were collected from 237 stated owner enterprises managers via questionnaires. The analysis produced structural models of <b>personal</b> <b>quality</b> predicted by IESQ and mediated by internal LOC. It shows that hypothesized model created three significant positive direct (IESQ) and indirect (internal LOC) impacts of predictors to <b>personal</b> <b>quality</b> of managers. For mediating effect of internal LOC on each hypothesized path, this study found partial mediating effects of internal LOC. The structural model achieved the highest SMC (R 2), explaining 65. 6 % of internal locus of control and 76. 2 % variance of the <b>personal</b> <b>quality</b> of managers. This study confirmed a significant positive direct relationship between the harmonies of IESQ to <b>personal</b> <b>quality.</b> This study found most of managers have a good standard of EQ and SQ rather than IQ. In this case, the application of EQ in a workplace depended on the person, whether he or she could place him or herself in gathering with others.

5|$|From 1254 to 1257, Edward {{was under}} the {{influence}} of his mother's relatives, known as the Savoyards, the most notable of whom was Peter of Savoy, the queen's uncle. After 1257, Edward increasingly fell in with the Poitevin or Lusignan faction – the half-brothers of his father HenryIII – led by such men as William de Valence. This association was significant, because the two groups of privileged foreigners were resented by the established English aristocracy, and they would be at the centre of the ensuing years' baronial reform movement. There were tales of unruly and violent conduct by Edward and his Lusignan kinsmen, which raised questions about the royal heir's <b>personal</b> <b>qualities.</b> The next years would be formative on Edward's character.|$|E

Kalākaua was acknowledged as having brought Hawaii to the forefront of the world's attention.

5|$|It is {{possible}} that the work was written principally for the benefit of a Welsh audience. Asser takes pains to explain local geography, so he was clearly considering an audience not familiar with the areas he described. More specifically, at several points he gives an English name and follows it with the Welsh equivalent, even in the case of Nottingham, which seems unlikely to have had a native Welsh name. As a result, and given that Alfred's overlordship of south Wales was recent, it may be that Asser intended the work to acquaint a Welsh readership with Alfred's <b>personal</b> <b>qualities</b> and reconcile them to his rule. However, {{it is also possible that}} Asser's inclusion of Welsh placenames simply reflects an interest in etymology or the existence of a Welsh audience in his own household rather than in Wales. There are also sections such as the support for Alfred's programme of fortification that give the impression of the book's being aimed at an English audience.|$|E

5|$|Stephen's <b>personal</b> <b>qualities</b> as a {{military}} leader focused on his skill in personal combat, his capabilities in siege warfare and a remarkable ability to move military forces quickly over relatively long distances. In response to the revolts and invasions, Stephen rapidly undertook several military campaigns, focusing primarily on England rather than Normandy. His wife Matilda was sent to Kent with ships and resources from Boulogne, {{with the task of}} retaking the key port of Dover, under Robert's control. A small number of Stephen's household knights were sent north to help the fight against the Scots, where David's forces were defeated later that year at the battle of the Standard in August by the forces of Thurstan, the Archbishop of York. Despite this victory, however, David still occupied most of the north. Stephen himself went west in an attempt to regain control of Gloucestershire, first striking north into the Welsh Marches, taking Hereford and Shrewsbury, before heading south to Bath. The town of Bristol itself proved too strong for him, and Stephen contented himself with raiding and pillaging the surrounding area. The rebels appear to have expected Robert to intervene with support that year, but he remained in Normandy throughout, trying to persuade the Empress Matilda to invade England herself. Dover finally surrendered to the queen's forces later in the year.|$|E
