40|$|Animated agent {{technology}} has been rapidly developed to provide ubiquitously psychological and functional benefits for fulfilling communicative goals. However, the character motions of most character-centered models based on pre-stored movement, finite state machine and scripted conditional logic are generally restrictive. The major drawback lies in the lack of maturity of integrating the elements between personality, emotion and behaviour. To {{bridge the gap between}} cognitive and behavioural elements, we examine the connections between human personality, emotion, movement and cartoon modeling for the agent design. Human personality and emotional behaviour are the essences in the recognition of a believable synthetic character. Personality and emotion come from the storylines and result in characters’ motions. Cartoon animations successfully engage the audience and create emotional connections with the spectators. However, even a sophisticated animator often faces some difficulties while performing a very laborious task to simulate an emotion- and personality-rich character. This thesis focuses on exploring effective techniques to extract personality and emotion features for a high-level control of character movements. A hierarchical fuzzy rule-based system was constructed, in which personality and emotion were mapped into the body’s movement zones of a character. This facilitates agent designers to control the personality and emotion of a dynamic synthetic character. The system was then applied to a Narrative Intelligent system and extended to an Ambient Intelligent environment. An innovative storyboard-structured storytelling method was devised by using story scripts and action descriptions in a form similar to the content description of storyboards to predict specific personality and emotion. As software or device agents evolve into the Ambient Intelligence, new concepts for effective agent presentations and delegating control are necessary to minimise the human’s tasks and interventions in the complex and dynamic environment. A novel customizable <b>personalised</b> <b>agent</b> framework was developed by utilising the spirit of cartoon animation to match each user’s profile {{in the form of a}} cartoon reciprocal agent. As a result, users could explicitly modify personality and emotion values to change the psychology traits of the agent, which would affect their appearance and behaviour through body posture expression. An evaluation of the system was conducted to verify the effectiveness and the applicability in both Narrative and Ambient intelligent agent frameworks. The significance of this research is that applying higher cognitive factors to animated characters can lead to a better animation design tool and reduce strenuous animation production efforts in agent designs. It will also enable animated characters to embody more adaptive, flexible and stylised performance...|$|E
40|$|With the {{internet}} revolutionising global tourism, technological changes {{continue to make}} inroads into the industry’s marketing and sales management models. Although many tourists still use shopfront providers, they are increasingly becoming a minority as the ‘mobile generation’ goes online for information and uses social media to discuss their holiday plans and book travel services. In Saudi Arabia, the religious tourism industry serving Hajj and Umrah pilgrims {{as well as other}} tourism clusters have been slow in coming to terms with e-commerce trends, preferring to offer a traditional personalised service to their clients. However, the logistical needs of servicing the rapidly increasing numbers of international pilgrims and growing IT literacy in the local market means that tourism management in Saudi Arabia needs to make considerable investments in time, resources and training to harness information technology and adopt business models that are at par with their global competitors. To respond to this issue, this study explores the perceptions and experiences of executives in the Hajj/Umrah as well as other tourism industry sectors to understand the factors that may have fostered or impeded e-commerce adoption. This research contributes to the existing research on e-commerce adoption in Saudi Arabia by providing an explanation of the factors that influence the adoption of e-commerce by the tourism industry and explaining how generic theories of technology adoption need to be contextualised for the specific conditions prevailing in the Arab tourism market. The practical contribution on this research relates to the solutions it offers for the challenges faced by the travel and tourism industry in e-commerce adoption in Saudi Arabia. The research was conducted using interviews with Saudi tourism executives to understand the contextual factors that influence the norms and attitudes prevailing in the tourism business that affect their adoption of e-commerce. This was followed by a questionnaire which was sent to a larger sample in Saudi cities, mainly focussing on Jeddah. The questionnaire focused on uncovering the factors influencing the adoption, or lack thereof, of e-commerce in the Saudi tourism industry. The research was grounded on a theoretical framework derived from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, Perceived Organisational and External E-Readiness scales, and Organisational Cultural Dimensions. The findings confirmed that the perceived relative advantage of e-commerce utilisation was an essential contributor to promote e-commerce in Saudi Arabia. Although government policy and industry norms were shown to influence e-commerce adoption, executives’ attitudes were found to strongly affect technology adoption and were shown to be indirectly modified by their ICT literacy and customer influence. Internal human and ICT resources also had a direct impact on the decision to adopt e-commerce. On the other hand, customers’ attitude relating to issues regarding online privacy and security and a lack of human interaction in a market with a preference for <b>personalised</b> <b>agent</b> service for customers form significant barriers to their adoption of e-commerce. There is also a lack of industry leadership and a supportive Saudi-based IT industry that can facilitate this move toward modernisation in industry standards. While there is a broad understanding of the importance of e-commerce, the tourism providers view an e-commerce strategy as not yet necessary, or indeed not yet relevant, for the tourism industry in Saudi Arabia at this time...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} {{electronic}} commerce has aroused considerable {{interest in the}} investigation of mechanisms for trading commodities online. The potential for trading institutions to avail of automated trading environments and trading agents has spawned wide-ranging research into negotiation and interaction protocols in multi agent systems. The theory of mechanism design from economics has been employed to construct entities that allow autonomous, self-interested software agents to interact in distributed environments. This work provides a critical survey of the field of automated markets at the confluence of microeconomic theory and multi-agent systems with particular emphasis on market mechanisms that provide a continuous trading environment. The long-term objective of the research in this field is the creation of fair and accessible market environments for <b>personalised</b> <b>agents</b> to operate within. The work presented here analyses this objective from several perspectives, the system designer providing the protocols/regulations, the preferences of consumers trading in the market and th...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{the area}} of {{financial}} decision making it {{is more and more}} acknowledged that psychological states and characteristics play an important role, for example feeling insecure in relation to financial risks, and being greedy in relation to opportunities to obtain serious gains. This paper presents an agent model of human decision making behaviour in economic situations, incorporating a human’s greed state and personality characteristic concerning risk. The model provides a basis for the development of <b>personalised</b> intelligent <b>agents</b> that support a person in financial decisions. To evaluate the model a number of simulation experiments have been performed, which illustrate the model’s ability to show behaviour of different types of personalities. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To date, most {{research}} on user models has been viewing the models {{as a single}} homogeneous entity. In contrast, {{a small number of}} recent modular approaches to user modelling permit the separate (and possibly heterogeneous) representation and acquisition of different aspects of the model, corresponding to different, competing user interests. This modularisation increases the flexibility, portability, and extensibility of the user models. This proves especially useful for modelling interests of users who are members of a team. We propose a modular approach based on different user perspectives such as team, role and current task. In our approach, an explicit, team model is contained within a single user model and components can be reused and shared by a number of users. We describe this approach in the application context of <b>Personalised</b> Briefing <b>Agents,</b> which are software agents that can automatically and autonomously filter and present information to a decision-maker. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an agent-based approach to semantic exploration and knowledge discovery in large information spaces {{by means of}} capturing, visualizing and making usable implicit knowledge structures {{of a group of}} users. The focus is on the developed conceptual model and system for creation and collaborative use of personalized learning knowledge maps. We use the paradigm of agents on the one hand as model for our approach, on the other hand it serves as a basis for an efficient implementation of the system. We present an unobtrusive model for profiling <b>personalised</b> user <b>agents</b> based on two dimensional semantic maps that provide 1) a medium of implicit communication between human users and the agents, 2) form of visual representation of resulting knowledge structures. Concerning the issues of implementation we present an agent architecture, consisting of two sets of asynchronously operating agents, which enables both sophisticated processing, as well as short respond times necessary for enabling interactive use in real-time. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the area}} of {{modelling}} financial decision making within economics it {{is more and more}} acknowledged that psychological states and personality characteristics play an important role. Examples of such states are feeling insecure in relation to financial risks, and being greedy in relation to opportunities to obtain serious gains. This paper presents an agentbased model of human decision making behaviour in economic situations, based on such psychological states and characteristics. The model takes ideas underlying the Modern Portfolio Theory within economics into account, and incorporates psychological concepts like greed and a personality characteristic concerning risk. Thus a model is obtained that may provide a basis for the development of <b>personalised</b> intelligent <b>agents</b> that support a person in financial decisions. To evaluate the model a number of simulation experiments have been performed, which illustrate the model’s ability to mimic investment behaviour of different types of personalities. In addition, a mathematical analysis of equilibrium states of the model is presented. 1...|$|R

40|$|The Grid is a {{large-scale}} computer {{system that is}} capable of coordinating resources that are not subject to centralised control, whilst using standard, open, general-purpose protocols and interfaces, and delivering non-trivial qualities of service. In this chapter, we argue that Grid applications very strongly suggest the use of agent-based computing, and we review key uses of agent technologies in Grids: user agents, able to customize and <b>personalise</b> data; <b>agent</b> communication languages offering a generic and portable communication medium; and negotiation allowing multiple distributed entities to reach service level agreements. In {{the second part of the}} chapter, we focus on Grid service discovery, which we have identified as a prime candidate for use of agent technologies: we show that Grid-services need to be located via personalised, semantic-rich discovery processes, which must rely on the storage of arbitrary metadata about services that originates from both service providers and service users. We present UDDI-MT, an extension to the standard UDDI service directory approach that supports the storage of such metadata via a tunnelling technique that ties the metadata store to the original UDDI directory. The outcome is a flexible service registry which is compatible with existing standards and also provides metadata-enhanced service discovery...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} is to find an effective way to personalise information searching on the Internet using middleware search <b>agents,</b> namely, <b>Personalised</b> Search <b>Agents</b> (PSA). The PSA acts between users and search engines, and applies new and existing techniques to mine and exploit relevant and personalised information for users. Much research has already been done in developing personalising filters, as a middleware technique which can act between user and search engines to deliver more personalised results. These personalising filters, apply {{one or more of the}} popular techniques for search result personalisation, such as the category concept, learning from user actions and using metasearch engines. By developing the PSA, these techniques have been investigated and incorporated to create an effective middleware agent for web search personalisation. In this thesis, a conceptual model for the <b>Personalised</b> Search <b>Agent</b> is developed, implemented by developing a prototype and benchmarked the prototype against existing web search practices. System development methodology which has flexible and iterative procedures that switch between conceptual design and prototype development was adopted as the research methodology. In the conceptual model of the PSA, a multi-layer client server architecture is used by applying generalisation-specialisation features. The client and the server are structurally the same, but differ in the level of generalisation and interface. The client handles personalising information regarding one user whereas the server effectively combines the personalising information of all the clients (i. e. its users) to generate a global profile. Both client and server apply the category concept where user selected URLs are mapped against categories. The PSA learns the user relevant URLs both by requesting explicit feedback and by implicitly capturing user actions (for instance the active time spent by the user on a URL). The PSA also employs a keyword-generating algorithm, and tries different combinations of words in a user search string by effectively combining them with the relevant category values. The core functionalities of the conceptual model for the PSA, were implemented in a prototype, used to test the ideas in the real word. The result was benchmarked with the results from existing search engines to determine the efficiency of the PSA over conventional searching. A comparison of the test results revealed that the PSA is more effective and efficient in finding relevant and personalised results for individual users and possesses a unique user sense rather than the general user sense of traditional search engines. The PSA, is a novel architecture and contributes to the domain of knowledge web information searching, by delivering new ideas such as active time based user relevancy calculations, automatic generation of sensible search keyword combinations and the implementation of a multi-layer agent architecture. Moreover, the PSA has high potential for future extensions as well. Because it captures highly personalised data, data mining techniques which employ case-based reasoning make the PSA a more responsive, more accurate and more effective tool for personalised information searching...|$|R
40|$|The most {{commonly}} used models, for distance training environment, propose learning activities which are generally limited to online lessons consultation and submission of home works to be marked by Graders before they are {{sent back to the}} learner. The tutors, seldom, intervene at the time when the learner {{is in the process of}} performing his/her learning activities. We present in this paper the design of an agent based interactive environment to assist the learner. This environment offers to the learner self-training resources, tutor service and distance assistance. In this context, the assistant can play the role of a substitute teacher and companion to the learner. We propose the use of an agent-based approach, which is a suitable for two main reasons: agents are a natural metaphor of human and it is convenient for complex distributed systems. Therefore, our aim is to create a <b>personalised</b> artificial assistant <b>agent</b> who is able to communicate with learner and help him/her to perform the tasks.

40|$|Modern Physical Education (PE) {{administered}} systemic {{models of}} teaching crafts. It atrophied the play element in human nature, and shaped a single-lens attitude {{to the treatment}} of bodies. Framing minds, it veiled the conditions of learning processes and thus “instituted” the sovereignty of subjective concerns. It created many unexplained “gaps” between abstract concerns and pragmatic issues. Following language’s poststructural analysis, PE’s professional communication practices were exposed to alternative methodological refocusing from conforming to move to <b>personalise</b> the <b>agent’s</b> experience in moving to learn. In the wake of poststructuralism came Whitehead’s Physical Literacy (PL) which I adopt as “leitmotif” to reform PE’s teacher preparation and schooling practices. PL addresses children up to 14 years. For older pupils, PL’s language needs to constitute versions of human purposes voiced by the introduction of a new development called “Movement Literacy” (ML). ML acknowledges that language and movement are very different forms of “self-expression”. By itself however, self-expression is inadequate when it comes to learning how to learn. Critical dialogue needs to be brought in to facilitate meaningful innovation in the PE world. By employing the philosophies of phenomenology and hermeneutics I make a case that expression in languaging movement [subjecting the agent’s account to hermeneutic treatment] is expression for others, and in exchange with others the expression is redefined, and changes the way one sees and talks about movement and about oneself. In its reflective practice, reverentially, ML will also unpack pedagogy’s hidden protocol, hoping to reclaim PE’s authentic purpose. It connects secular matters with sacred implications by reconciling the polemic differences between “techne” [purpose] and “phronesis ” [prudence]. With limited reference to Eastern “selflessness” ML advances teaching, through pedagogy and andragogy as a life-time mission. Not providing answers, the thesis offers a manifesto attempting to facilitate new questions such as: how can language and movement communicate? and how can movement educators “minister” to their learner’s sense of well-being...|$|R
