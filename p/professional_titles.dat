5|$|Higher {{education}} {{first arrived}} at Pichilemu in 1970, when the Centro Medio Profesional de Pichilemu (Pichilemu Secondary-Professional Centre) was created; however, it was discontinued the next year. In 2002, thirty-one {{years after the}} Centro Medio Profesional was discontinued, the Universidad Academia de Humanismo Cristiano (Academy of Christian Humanism University) began to give classes of Engineering in Public Gesture Management, and Engineering in Environment Gesture Management. The university worked at the dependencies of Liceo Agustín Ross Edwards until 2008. At least ten people obtained their <b>professional</b> <b>titles,</b> while other ten {{are still in the}} process of obtaining their titles, as of December 2011. In November 2011, Governor of Cardenal Caro Province Julio Ibarra announced that an institute of higher education would be brought to the province, whose name, Instituto Profesional IPG (IPG Professional Institute), was disclosed one month later. During the inauguration of the 2012 school year in Pichilemu, Education Regional Secretary Minister (Seremi) Pedro Larraín said IPEGE would work in the dependencies of Colegio de la Preciosa Sangre of Pichilemu.|$|E
25|$|For some <b>professional</b> <b>titles</b> (e.g. doktor, profesor), the pan/pani can be dropped, {{resulting}} in a form which is less formal, but still polite. Unlike the above, this can also precede a name (almost always last), but it's seldom used in second person.|$|E
25|$|These <b>professional</b> <b>titles</b> {{are more}} formal as the speaker humbles him/herself {{and puts the}} {{addressee}} at a higher rank or status. These {{can also be used}} along with a name (only last or both names), but that's extremely formal and almost never used in direct conversation.|$|E

25|$|In 1967, Laver won 19 titles, {{including}} the Wimbledon Pro, the US Pro Championships, the Wembley Pro Championship, and the French Pro Championship, {{which gave him}} a clean sweep {{of the most important}} <b>professional</b> <b>titles,</b> a professional Grand Slam. The tournament in 1967 on Wimbledon's Centre Court was the only professional event ever staged on that court before the Open Era began. Laver beat Rosewall in the final 6–2, 6–2, 12–10.|$|E

25|$|In {{the book}} Masters of the Baize, a {{detailed}} comparison and ranking of snooker professionals, authors Luke Williams and Paul Gadsby rated Davis {{as the third}} greatest snooker player of all time behind Joe Davis and Stephen Hendry. Davis has won a record 81 <b>professional</b> <b>titles</b> and was the runner-up in 37 events. 28 of these titles were in ranking events. His record of six world titles {{in the modern era}} has been bettered only by Hendry and no player has yet matched his tally of six UK titles. Davis has also compiled over 300 competitive centuries during his career. In 2011 he was inducted to World Snooker's newly created Hall of Fame along with seven former World Champions.|$|E
25|$|Davis came {{to public}} {{prominence}} after his {{performance at the}} 1980 World Championship, where he reached the quarter-finals, defeating defending champion Terry Griffiths en route, before losing to Alex Higgins. Davis won his first major title {{in the same year}} – the UK Championship – during which he beat Griffiths 9–0 in the semi-finals and Higgins 16–6 in the final. This began an 18-month period of dominance. He won the Classic and then the International Masters and English <b>Professional</b> <b>titles</b> in 1981, and became the bookmakers' favourite to win the 1981 World Championship, despite being seeded only 15. Davis reached the final by defeating Jimmy White in the first round, Higgins in the second round, Griffiths in the quarter-finals and defending champion Cliff Thorburn in the semi-final. Davis's 18–12 victory over Doug Mountjoy in the final confirmed bookmakers' early predictions, and in celebration his manager Barry Hearn charged across the arena to lift him up in the air. He would go on to reach seven out of the next eight world finals. Peculiarly, Davis's first four world finals were each against a player of a different nationality, something that had not occurred before and has not since.|$|E

2500|$|Most fellow {{tennis players}} reacted {{negatively}} to her announcement, {{with almost no}} support or sympathy in general for Sharapova. John McEnroe and Pat Cash said they {{found it hard to}} believe her. Jennifer Capriati posted on Twitter that she should be stripped of her 35 <b>professional</b> <b>titles.</b> Chris Evert expressed her surprise at the lack of support in tennis for Sharapova, noting that she [...] " [...] always isolated herself {{from the rest of the}} tennis world, from the players". Serena Williams expressed surprise at Sharapova’s announcement but commended her for being [...] "upfront with what she had done". Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray all publicly condemned Sharapova and argued that she deserved to be punished on the basis that she failed the doping test, with Murray adding that [...] "Taking a drug you don't necessarily need because it's legal is wrong" [...] and Federer stating that [...] "Whether it's intentional or not, I don't see too much difference. You must be 100 percent about what you are taking". Sharapova's case prompted Federer to urge the tennis federation to conduct more anti-doping tests. Novak Djokovic said that he felt sorry for her, but that she must still be ready for punishment. Victoria Azarenka and Dominika Cibulkova were far less supportive, with Cibulkova adding that she didn't feel sorry at all for Sharapova and didn't miss having her on the tour, describing her as [...] "a totally unlikeable person; arrogant, conceited, and cold". The Russian Tennis Federation strongly defended Sharapova, describing the positive drug test as [...] "nonsense" [...] and adding that they expected Sharapova to be available for the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.|$|E
