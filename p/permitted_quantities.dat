Residue can be a consequence of the inadequate use of medicines in veterinary medicine and pesticides in agriculture and veterinary medicine, as well as the polluting of the environment with toxic elements, dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls, and others. Residue is being monitored in Serbia since 1972, and in 2004, national monitoring was brought to the level of EU countries through significant investments by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management. This is also evident in the EU directives which permit exports of all kinds of meat and primary products of animal origin, covered by the Residue Monitoring Program.

In this paper, we explore {{the extent to}} which a coalition of wind power producers can exploit the statistical benefits of aggregation to mitigate the risk of quantity shortfall with respect to forward contract offerings for energy. We propose a simple augmentation of the existing two-settlement market system with nodal pricing to <b>permit</b> <b>quantity</b> risk sharing among wind power producers by affording the group a recourse opportunity to utilize improved forecasts of their ensuing wind energy production to collectively modify their forward contracted positions so as to utilize the projected surplus in generation at certain buses to balance the projected shortfall in generation at complementary buses.

We also asses the willingness of individual wind power producers to form a coalition to cooperatively offer contracts for energy. We first show that the expected profit derived from coalitional contract offerings with recourse is greater than that achievable through independent contract offerings.

40|$|On 23 October 2001 the European Commission {{adopted a}} {{proposal}} for a directive for trade in greenhouse gas emissions. Following the US experience of emissions trading systems, this marks the first large-scale attempt to deploy this instrument of environmental policy in Europe. The proposal places European climate protection policy on a completely new footing. The prospects of its implementation have increased since the climate change conference in Marrakech. This paper introduces the draft directive and gives an initial economic appraisal. It concludes that the directive deliberately and wisely - limits the scope of the first trading phase starting 2005. Consequently, there is still considerable scope for increasing its efficiency (resulting from gains from trading) in later phases, namely by extending both the number of participants and the gases included. The number of participants in the first phase and the institutional arrangements, however, appear sufficient to enable a liquid, functioning market. In this respect, also the politically difficult decision to start with a compulsory system is to be welcomed. Important issues not yet sufficiently clarified include the concrete rules for defining the total <b>permit</b> <b>quantity</b> issued to participants by each Member State, and whether other economic sectors, which are to be treated by other policies and measures, will bear a comparable burden. Furthermore, the essential questions of primary allocation and treatment of newcomers which are in principle left up to Member States as well as the linkage of emissions trading with existing policies affecting the participating sectors must be solved before legal implementation is recommended.

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{explored the}} semantics of the mass-count distinction {{in young children}} and adults. In Experiments 1 and 2, the quantity judgments of participants provided evidence that some mass nouns refer to individuals, as such. Participants judged one large portion of stuff to be "more" than three tiny portions for substance-mass nouns (e. g. mustard, ketchup), but chose according to number for count nouns (e. g. shoes, candles) and object-mass nouns (e. g. furniture, jewelry). These results suggest that some mass nouns quantify over individuals, and that therefore reference to individuals does not distinguish count nouns from mass nouns. Thus, Experiments 1 and 2 failed to {{support the hypothesis that}} there exist one-to-one mappings between mass-count syntax and semantics for either adults or young children. In Experiment 3, it was found that for mass-count flexible terms (e. g. string, stone) participants based quantity judgments on number when the terms were used with count syntax, but on total amount of stuff when used with mass syntax. Apparently, the presence of discrete physical objects in a scene (e. g. stones) is not sufficient to <b>permit</b> <b>quantity</b> judgments based on number. It is proposed that object-mass nouns (e. g. furniture) can be used to refer to individuals due to lexically specified grammatical features that normally occur in count syntax. Also, we suggest that children learning language parse words that refer to individuals as count nouns unless given morpho-syntactic and referential evidence to the contrary, in which case object-mass nouns are acquired...|$|R
40|$|The optimal {{pollution}} permit trading system is examined when the regulator, faced with incomplete information on firms' abatement costs and delivery coefficients, seeks to minimize expected total abatement costs {{to meet an}} ex ante pollution target. Intuitively, {{we find that the}} optimal trading ratio and permit cap are set such that there will be more pollution when abatement costs are high and less pollution when abatement costs are low. Surprisingly however, even when the delivery coefficients are known with certainty, the optimal trading ratio will not necessarily equal the delivery coefficient, nor will it be optimal for the total <b>permit</b> <b>quantity</b> to equal the given pollution target. Instead, the trading ratio will tend to be larger when there is negative correlation between firms' abatement costs and/or there is positive correlation between abatement costs and the delivery coefficient. The result that the optimal permit trading system under these circumstances depends on the regulator's information on firm's abatement costs contrasts sharply with a previously well-established attribute of permit trading systems: no information on firms' abatement costs is needed in order to design an optimal policy and achieve the least cost of reaching a pollution target (ex post). Our results demonstrate that whether an ex ante or ex post pollution target is used has fundamental implications for the design of the permit trading system. Finally, while not descriptive of all pollution problems, the class of pollutants for which this model applies is large. delivery coefficient, ex ante pollution target, ex post pollution target, permit trading, total permit cap, trading ratio, Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{protection}} {{has become}} {{a central part of}} national as well as international environmental policy, triggered off above all by the reports of the "International Panel on Climate Change" and by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Its scientific modelling is carried out in four steps: - Economic activity and emission of greenhouse gases, - Atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases and climate change, - Costs and benefits of climate protection, - Environmental policy instruments and strategies of climate protection. A peculiarity of climate change is its element of uncertainty on every stage of its scientific and economic analysis. The focus of interest in discovering costs and benefits of climate protection is the extent of the estimated damage and abatement costs and the level of the discount rate. The latter is a value judgement concerning the role of future generations when making economic policy decisions. Market economy orientated instruments of climate protection are environmental taxes (price solution) and tradeable <b>permits</b> (<b>quantity</b> solution). The form of environmental taxation is analyzed in view of an ecological tax reform in Germany. Additional to a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions ("first dividend") a welfare improving correction of the tax system and an increase in employment ("second dividend") is hoped for. A stepwise (EC- or world wide) introduction of a system of tradeable permits is supposed to lighten an international harmonized reduction of carbon dioxide emissions instead of a national or international carbon dioxide or energy tax. It also can be combined with a national environmental tax. The major problem is the fair allocation of permits to advanced industrial and to less developed countries (grandfathering, public auction) and the organization of the permit market. ...|$|R
