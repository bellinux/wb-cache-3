5|$|The {{significance}} of the APEC summit called for stringent and expensive security arrangements. The <b>Protective</b> <b>Security</b> Coordination Centre, of the National Security and Criminal Justice Group from the Australian Attorney-General's Department, oversaw security planning through the APEC 2007 Security Branch, formed expressly for the APEC meetings. In order to secure and monitor the summit, the New South Wales Police Force instituted the APEC Police Security Command. Many public roads in Sydney were closed, as leaders, officials, and personnel travelled in motorcades around the city centre. Figures released by the state government at a Senate committee hearing show that security measures at APEC cost $170million.|$|E

He also arranged with the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2, Major General George V. Strong, for support from the Military Intelligence Service. Strong gave Lansdale special responsibility for the Manhattan District, and Lansdale, in turn, arranged with the G-2s of each of the service commands for officers to be assigned to report directly to him, thus bypassing both the service command G-2s and their commanders. He also organised a special counterintelligence group in Washington, D.C., headed by himself, that reported directly to both Strong and Brigadier General Leslie Groves, who became director of the Manhattan Project in September 1942.|$|E

25|$|When a person’s {{capabilities}} are lowered, {{they are in}} some way deprived of earning as much income as they would otherwise. An old, ill man cannot earn {{as much as a}} healthy young man; gender roles and customs may prevent a woman from receiving an education or working outside the home. There may be an epidemic that causes widespread panic, or there could be rampant violence in the area that prevents people from going to work for fear of their lives. As a result, income and economic inequality increases, and it becomes more difficult to reduce the gap without additional aid. To prevent such inequality, this approach believes it’s important to have political freedom, economic facilities, social opportunities, transparency guarantees, and <b>protective</b> <b>security</b> to ensure that people aren’t denied their functionings, capabilities, and agency and can thus work towards a better relevant income.|$|E

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of widespread poverty and deprivation in South Asian countries points towards {{the need to}} adopt a wider concept of social security that would include both promotional and <b>protective</b> social <b>security.</b> This article advocates this view {{against the backdrop of}} the coverage and financing of existing social security programmes and points to the inadequacies of these measures in attaining the objectives of higher economic growth and the eradication of poverty. A character-istic feature of current social security programmes in South Asian economies is that they are designed in a conceptual vacuum and are implemented mainly as wel-fare measures. The emphasis is on promotional measures and even within that cat-egory, on poverty alleviation programmes. A balanced provision of promotional and <b>protective</b> social <b>security</b> measures is not evident in any country. Some esti-mates of the resource requirements for providing such balanced social security suggest that the cumulative cost of essential human investment over the period 1995 - 2010 would be over 4 - 5 per cent of GDP. Such allocation of resources towards the wider connotation of social security is essential for the South Asian countries to reap the benefits of the linkages between social attainments and eco-nomic growth, a la East Asia. 1...|$|R

2500|$|The {{task force}} began {{arriving}} at Vung Tau between April and June 1966. From 17 May to 15 June, US and Australian forces secured {{the area around}} Nui Dat during Operation Hardihood, deploying two battalions of the US 173rd Airborne Brigade and an element of 1 RAR. 5 RAR deployed from Vung Tau the same day and was tasked with clearing any Viet Cong found in an area [...] east and north-east of Nui Dat. 1 ATF occupied Nui Dat from 5 June, with Jackson flying-in with his tactical headquarters to take command. The plan to operate independently resulted in significant self-protection requirements and 1 ATF's initial priorities were to establish a base and ensure its own security. Meanwhile, Wilton's decision to occupy Nui Dat rather than co-locate 1 ATF with its logistic support at Vung Tau allowed the task force {{to have a greater}} impact but resulted in additional manpower demands to secure the base. Indeed, the security requirements of an understrength brigade in an area of strong Viet Cong activity utilised up to half the force, limiting its freedom of action. As part of the occupation all inhabitants within a 4,000-metre radius had been removed and resettled nearby. A <b>protective</b> <b>security</b> zone was then established, the limit of which was designated Line Alpha, and a free-fire zone declared. Although unusual for allied installations in Vietnam, many of which were located near populated areas, the Australians hoped to deny the Viet Cong observation of Nui Dat and afford greater security to patrols entering and exiting the area.|$|E

2500|$|As {{part of the}} {{occupation}} all inhabitants within a 4,000-metre radius had been removed and resettled nearby. A <b>protective</b> <b>security</b> zone was then established, the limit of which was designated Line Alpha, and a free-fire zone declared. Although unusual for allied installations in Vietnam, {{many of which were}} located near populated areas, the Australians hoped to deny the Viet Cong observation of Nui Dat and afford greater security to patrols entering and exiting the area. Yet while adding to the physical security of the base, disrupting a major Viet Cong support area and removing the local population from danger, such measures may have been counter-productive. Indeed, the resettlement resulted in widespread resentment and it was debatable how much information the inhabitants would provide on Viet Cong movements, potentially creating an opportunity to attack Nui Dat without warning. Meanwhile, the Viet Cong continued to observe the base from the Nui Dinh hills. Movement was heard around the perimeter over the first few nights as they attempted to locate the Australian defences under the cover of darkness and heavy rain. Although no clashes occurred and the reconnaissance soon ceased, they were believed to be finalising preparations for an attack. On 10 June reporting indicated a Viet Cong regiment was moving towards Nui Dat from the north-west and was about [...] away. The same day three 120mm mortar rounds landed just outside the base. That night Australian artillery fired on suspected movement along Route 2, although no casualties were found the next day. Further warnings of a four-battalion attack hastened the call-forward of 6 RAR, which arrived from Vung Tau on 14 June. Despite such reports though no attack occurred, and the initial reaction to 1 ATF's lodgement proved unexpectedly limited.|$|E

40|$|Social Security is {{achieved}} when deprivation or vulnerability is reduced or removed {{as a result}} of using social means, thereby, in the process, making lives and livelihoods more secure. However, provision of such social security measures is influenced by various supply and demand factors. This paper attempts to explain the provision of social security in the fisheries sector of Kerala State in south India. It enumerates the salient achievements and the problems faced by the state in providing concrete social security measures for fishworkers. They were a section of Kerala society that was initially left out of the development process. The study also shows how netting them back into the mainstream was not only the result of enlightened state policy, but also, the result of the collective action by the fishworkers themselves. Finally, the paper reflects on what {{more needs to be done}} to further improve the standard of living of the fishing communities in Kerala and to streamline the delivery of social security.
