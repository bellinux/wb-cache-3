40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of {{information}} transmission in explaining donors' choice between <b>project</b> <b>aid</b> and budget support. Budget support increases the involvement of recipient governments {{in the decision-making process}} and can thus be an example of a delegation-scheme. Conversely, <b>project</b> <b>aid</b> represents a more centralized type of aid. According to the theory, when countries' local knowledge is more important than donors' information, recipient countries' discretion in the choice of policies should be increased (delegation). Conversely, there should be less freedom in designing policies when donors' information is more relevant (centralization). The empirical analysis confirms that the importance of donors' private information influences the amount of <b>project</b> <b>aid,</b> while recipients' local knowledge is positively correlated with the amount of budget support...|$|E

40|$|Should donors {{interested}} in the effectiveness of developmental programmes rely on conditional budget support or on <b>project</b> <b>aid?</b> To answer this question, we present a model in which only a subset of developmental expenditures can be subject to conditionality. We show that budget support is preferable to <b>project</b> <b>aid</b> when the preferences of donors and recipients are aligned, and when assistance is small relative to the recipients' own resources. Furthermore, when donors cannot observe the recipient's type, they may impose higher levels of conditionality to separate committed governments from uncommitted ones.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the empirics of aid and growth by investigating whether aid modality matters in explaining its effectiveness. For this purpose, we include the four main aid modalities (<b>project</b> <b>aid,</b> financial programme aid, technical assistance grants and food aid) as explanatory variables in an endogenous growth model. Using the GMM-SYS approach to dynamic panel estimator we test the three main competing specifications in the aid and growth literature for a sample of aid recipient countries over the 1974 - 2001 period. We find that <b>project</b> <b>aid</b> exerts a positive and significant impact on growth, thus casting doubt on the so-called “micromacro paradox”. Our results also show that financial programme aid generally impacts on growth negatively, while the impact of non-financial aid, technical assistance grants and food aid, is statistically insignificant. We found, however, no {{evidence to suggest that}} policy enhances the growth effect of the aid categories. Our non-linearity tests suggest that only <b>project</b> <b>aid</b> is associated with diminishing returns. Finally, our results confirm the finding that climate related conditions affect the working of aid (project) ...|$|E

40|$|Foreign aid {{recipient}} fiscal response {{in developing countries}} is studied using utility/welfare maximization principle. The underlying assumption of this function (utility/welfare can be maximized by narrowing the deviations of the actual values from their desired values subject to the constraints of finance) doesn’t capture the interplay between <b>project</b> <b>aid</b> inflows and the adjustment process of the government budget. This paper proposes an alternative framework in conceptualizing the recipients fiscal response. This was possible due to the special feature of this paper that aid is disassociated from foreign capital inflow and also identified by its usage {{which is not the}} case in other similar studies. This makes one of the strong point and hence the advantage of this paper. Ethiopia in the pre-EPRDF regimes received <b>project</b> <b>aid.</b> The alternative conceptual framework is that <b>project</b> <b>aid</b> is an investment support which pays only for foreign exchange cost component of the investment program. This kind of aid requires the recipient government to generate local resource in order to finance the local currency component of the investment cost and recurrent costs to keep the created capacity running. In this context the change in investment will be greater than the change in <b>project</b> <b>aid</b> inflow. Hence, domestic savings will increase and government tries to improve both tax collection effort and rate and in the context of burgeoned public sector, the government will also try to raise its non-tax revenue through public enterprises surplus transfer (this has never been an issue of the fiscal response literature) to finance the difference. The results were entirely contrary to the conventional claims. <b>Project</b> <b>aid</b> has no ‘displacement effect’. Government was responding positively to <b>project</b> <b>aid</b> by improving both tax collection effort and tax rates and by increasing its non-tax revenue. In the absence of real savings, the government, however, finances the local currency component of the investment cost by domestic bank borrowing: transferring private resources and printing money. It is argued that transferring of resources from private budget surplus to the public sector was carried out through distorted preferential domestic credit policies by crowding-out private investment and depressing personal consumption. Distorted domestic credit policies (rationing with preferential treatment to public sector) was, therefore, unintended outcome the fiscal adjustment to the aid inflow, generating the local fund for local currency costs of the aid-financed public investment in excess of real public savings...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{uses the}} fiscal {{response}} framework {{to investigate the}} extent to which different categories of foreign aid flows, namely <b>project</b> <b>aid,</b> programme aid, technical assistance and food aid, displace public savings and affect the recipient country's dependence on aid, using time series data for Cote d'Ivoire for the period 1975 - 99. The results indicate that, in general, <b>project</b> <b>aid</b> flows tend to reduce public savings and worsen Cote d'Ivoire's dependence on aid more than the other categories of aid flows. This finding therefore suggests that accounting for aid heterogeneity in aid studies as well as aid policies design and implementation could be crucial in improving aid effectiveness to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. ...|$|E
