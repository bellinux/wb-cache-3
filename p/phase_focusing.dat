5000|$|The 70-mph {{provision}} {{was added to}} Section 46.2-870 via an amendment effective on July 1, 2010. The previous version of the statute had authorized a 70-mph speed limit only on I-85; the maximum limit permitted elsewhere was 65 mph. Notably, the revised statute {{does not require a}} 70-mph speed limit on any road nor make such limit automatic, due to the requirement for traffic and engineering studies. The Virginia Department of Transportation began studying Interstate highways with 65-mph speed limits during April 2010 to determine which roads should receive the 70-mph limit and announced that the studies would be conducted in three phases {{over a period of several}} months, with the initial <b>phase</b> <b>focusing</b> on 323 miles of highway with [...] "no significant levels of crashes and congestion". As of July 1, 2010, VDOT increased the speed limit to 70 mph on a portion of one highway (I-295 south of I-64). On October 20, 2010, Governor Bob McDonnell announced that by the end of 2010, VDOT would post 70-mph speed limits on 680 miles of Virginia Interstates located outside of urban areas, representing 61 percent of Virginia's total 1,119 miles of Interstate highways. While the statute allows for speed limits up to 70 mph on urban Interstates, as of March 2015 VDOT has declined to post a limit higher than 65 mph on any urban highway.|$|E

Started in 2009 by Walter Adam [...] "Dirty Walt" [...] Kibby, II, of Fishbone, and Roderick Byron [...] "Rodcore" [...] Palmer of the band Year Of The Dragon along with their then manager, Kraus, an attorney, who previously was the road manger for The Incredible Lance Diamond and manager of Rick James's Original Stone City Band, among others. The label released the first full-length by YOTD, Blunt Force Karma (Produced by Darryl Swann with Kraus and Kibby as Executive Producers), and the sophomore release by Dirty Walt And The Columbus Sanatation (produced by Kibby with Kraus as Executive Producer). Subsequently, the label reissued the debut of Seattle's experimental jazz quartet Uncle Pooch, Conduct Unbecoming. The label showcased at South By Southwest in 2009, 2010, and 2011. Kibby and Palmer left the label in 2010 after YOTD's tour in support of Blunt Force Karma (to date BFK is YOTD's only full length release and most likely will remain so as Palmer left the band in 2015), leaving Kraus as the sole owner and operator. Kraus then commissioned Uncle Pooch's bassist Shane Smith as the label's Musical Director. With Smith providing all musical content and Kraus providing lyrics, artwork, and production the two of the have teamed up to guide the label through it's second <b>phase</b> <b>focusing</b> exclusively on underground and uncompromising artists who defy categorization. Two more releases by Uncle Pooch, Oneiroprenia (with production by Scott Colburn, Darryl Swann, and Kraus and graphic design by Mike Sparrow) and Sonarchy (produced by Smith and Kraus graphic design by Sparrow) in 2012. After a hiatus while Kraus pursued {{a career as a}} law professor and Smith worked on demos with various artists the label returned with Smith and Los Angeles underground icon Blackbird contributing a song to the Black Rock Coalition's 25 Year Anniversary Compilation in 2016 at Kraus' urging. Smith's band Karmic Unrest (www.karmicunrestband.com) released their debut -The Ambivalence Of The Scared (produced by R.L. Heyer and Kraus and mastered by Peter A. Barker) in 2017. Uncle Pooch's final album, The Comfort Of Violence, and two releases by Headlock are scheduled for release in late 2017. The label plans on re-issuing the debut EP by unsung pioneering black rockers Sky Church originally released in 1993 by Kraus and guitarist Mytch Meadows and remastered by Barker in 2018 for the releases 25th anniversary.|$|E

Both transverse and longitudinal focusing {{can be obtained}} from the radio frequency field by using the technique known as Alternating <b>Phase</b> <b>Focusing.</b> The design of suitable sequences has been difficult, without direct theoretical support, inhibiting Alternating <b>Phase</b> <b>Focusing</b> adoption. Synthesis of reported details and new physics and technique result in a new, general method for designing practical Alternating <b>Phase</b> <b>Focusing</b> linear accelerators. Very long sequences with high energy gain factors are demonstrated, motivated by the desire to accelerate particles over a factor of 500 - 600 energy gain. The method is demonstrated with simple dynamics and no space charge, later incorporation of space charge and more accurate elements is straight forward. Alternating <b>Phase</b> <b>Focusing</b> can now be another practical approach in the linear accelerator designer repertoire.
