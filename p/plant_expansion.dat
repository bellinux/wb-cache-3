40|$|Nitrogen {{deposition}} {{is generally}} considered as a main reason for many recent <b>plant</b> <b>expansions,</b> but management changes are often not taken into account. Understanding the effects of agriculture management in the past can be decisive in the explanation of <b>plant</b> <b>expansions</b> at present. In {{order to understand the}} spread of Molinia caerulea and Calamagrostis villosa into Nardus stricta dominated subalpine grassland in the Giant Mts. (Krkonoše, Karkonosze), we undertook an experiment to explain farmer decision making and we discussed its effect on grassland succession. We measured mowing productivity, yields, biomass quality and nutrient removal in N. stricta, M. caerulea, and C. villosa dominated swards. With regard to defoliation management performed on the subalpine grasslands for at least 500 years and cancelled after the Second World War, we found the following results and conclusions. 1. Mowing productivity, yield and forage quality were lowest in the N. stricta sward, therefore farmers preferred to harvest C. villosa and M. caerulea stands if they had the possibility to select a sward for mowing. 2. Removal of all nutrients was the lowest in the N. stricta sward. With respect to these facts, the competitive advantage of N. stricta is obvious under long-term scything without fertilization. Consequently, the recent increase of defoliation sensitive species M. caerulea and C. villosa above the timber line must be evaluated with respect to both: termination of agricultural activities and recent nitrogen deposition...|$|R

40|$|A plant-wide {{energy model}} is being {{developed}} to be used primarily as a planning tool to evaluate the impact of energy conservation projects and <b>plant</b> <b>expansions</b> on the total plant energy balance.

The form of the model varies from unit to unit. Startups, shutdowns, and unit interruptions are simulated using a Monte Carlo technique. In some units, energy consumption does not correlate with production rate, which indicates that energy savings may be possible through better control of energy usage. The model should also lay the framework for an on-line energy management program...|$|R
