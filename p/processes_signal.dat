40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to explore {{possibilities}} of implementing low-cost instruments such as spectrum analyzers and oscilloscopes by applying Digital Alias-free Signal Processing (DASP) techniques. For most of signal processing tasks where traditional DSP is applied the information of bandwidth of the <b>processed</b> <b>signal</b> is required to be known. Here the sampling rate is decided {{to be at least}} twice the actual bandwidth of the signal. However, there are cases where the exact bandwidth information of the <b>processed</b> <b>signal</b> is unknown or the reconstructibility of the <b>processed</b> <b>signal</b> is not needed. Then this demand on sampling rates leads to oversampling of the analysed signal. Review of literature shows that application of DASP is an ideal solution on this issue. In comparison with traditional DSP, DASP does not require the exact bandwidth information of the signal and can still <b>process</b> the analysed <b>signals</b> for different signal processing tasks at lower sampling rates such as sub-Nyquist, even sub-Landau rates. Therefore the work reported in this thesis concentrates on the investigation of DASP techniques for reducing the costs of contemporary instruments.

This identification algorithm can eliminate any needs for the mechanism or prior knowledge of the nonlinear or linear block. Furthermore, in comparison with traditional single-channel identification algorithm, this multi-channel one can increase the approximate accuracy remarkably. In addition, under weak assumptions on the persistency of excitation (PE) of the inputs, the algorithm provides consistent estimates in the presence of white output noise, moreover, its convergence can also be theoretically proved. At last, the performances of the identification algorithm are illustrated through simulations on a benchmark problem, a pH neutralization process, which validate the feasibility and superiority of these proposed algorithms.
