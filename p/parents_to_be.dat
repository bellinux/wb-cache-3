5|$|With the Halliwells' help, Billie {{attempts}} to help Christy reintegrate back into {{everyday life and}} to gain control over her powers. Billie and the Halliwells are unaware of Christy's collaboration with the Triad. The Triad identifies Billie as the Ultimate Power, which was foreshadowed in earlier episodes as the season's big bad, and refers to Christy {{as the key to}} unlocking Billie's power. The Triad arranges for Christy's <b>parents</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> killed by a pair of Noxon demons (John Rosenfeld and David S. Lee), believing prolonged contact with them could sway her morality to the side of good. Billie becomes angry by the Halliwell sisters when they decide to interrogate the demons to gather more information about the Ultimate Power rather than killing them to avenge her parents' deaths. Christy uses Billie's feeling of betrayal to turn her against the Charmed Ones. Billie and Christy vanquish the Noxon demons, who were previously believed to be invincible, and the Halliwell sisters realize that Billie is the Ultimate Power.|$|E

25|$|A {{recent study}} in California {{examined}} {{the amount of}} child play that occurred {{on the streets of}} neighbourhoods with different characteristics; grid pattern and culs-de-sac. The findings indicate that the open grid streets showed substantially lower play activity than the cul-de-sac street type. Culs-de-sac reduce perceived danger from traffic thereby encouraging more outdoor play. It pointed the way toward the development of hybrid street network patterns that improve pedestrian movement but restrict cut-through driving. Similar studies in Europe and most recently in Australia found that children's outdoor play is significantly reduced on through roads where traffic is, or perceived by <b>parents</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> a risk.|$|E

25|$|Having a {{last name}} of Levi or a related term does not {{necessarily}} mean a person is a Levite, and some Levites do not have such last names. Levitical status is passed down in families from parent to child, as part of a family's genealogical tradition. Tribal status of Levite is determined by patrilineal descent, so a child whose biological father is a Levite (in cases of adoption or artificial insemination, status is determined by the genetic father), is also considered a Levite. Jewish status is determined by matrilineal descent, thus conferring levitical status onto children requires both biological <b>parents</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Israelites and the biological father to be a Levite.|$|E
25|$|Sergey Kavtaradze {{was later}} {{moved to a}} prison in Tbilisi, but brought back to Moscow in February 1939. The couple were {{suddenly}} released in late 1939, and were first allowed {{to see each other}} in Beria's Moscow apartment. British historian Simon Sebag Montefiore argues that this was a delayed consequence of a letter Stalin received in 1936: in it, the couple's eleven-year-old daughter, Maya, begged for her <b>parents</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> allowed to live. The Kavtaradzes (including Maya, who was allowed to leave Tbilisi and transported to Moscow) moved into a hotel, and then allowed to settle in a communal apartment. In what was an unprecedented gesture, Stalin and Beria paid them a visit in their new home.|$|E
25|$|There {{had been}} {{controversy}} over Graham's proposed burial place; he announced in June 2007 {{that he and}} his wife would be buried alongside each other at the Billy Graham Library in his hometown of Charlotte, North Carolina. Graham's younger son Ned had argued with older son Franklin about whether burial at a library would be appropriate. Ruth Graham had said that she wanted to be buried not in Charlotte but in the mountains near Asheville, North Carolina, where she had lived for many years; Ned supported his mother's choice. Novelist Patricia Cornwell, a family friend, also opposed burial at the library, calling it a tourist attraction. Franklin wanted his <b>parents</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> buried at the library site. At the time of Ruth Graham's death, it was announced that they would be buried at the library site.|$|E

25|$|Women in pre-modern society {{were seen}} as bearers of children, {{retailers}} of fish, and farmers. Within the traditional sphere, the childbearing ability of women was explained as {{the means by which}} lineage ancestors were allowed to be reborn. In pre-colonial times, polygamy was encouraged, especially for wealthy men. In patrilineal societies, dowry received from marrying off daughters was seen as a traditional means for <b>parents</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> acknowledged for taking good care of their daughters. Also to thank them for the good training. Within the last couples of decades, the roles of the feminine gender has evolved tremendously. Ghanaian women no longer 'belong to the kitchen', roles and responsibilities which hitherto remained the prerogative of females is now very common with males. Females have climbed to the upper leadership echelons of politics, career, business, and all other sectors. Notable political personalities include Joyce Adeline Bamford-Addo (Speaker of the 5th Session of the Parliament), Georgina Theodora Wood (Chief Justice) as well as a host of past and current political office holders. This renaissance {{is a direct result of}} the efforts put in by Ghana's vibrant civil society. Women have since risen to positions of professional importance in southern Ghana.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, Borlaug {{extended}} {{this technique}} {{by suggesting that}} several pure lines with different resistance genes should be developed through backcross methods using one recurrent parent. Backcrossing involves crossing a hybrid and subsequent generations with a recurrent parent. As a result, the genotype of the backcrossed progeny becomes increasingly {{similar to that of}} the recurrent parent. Borlaug's method would allow the various different disease-resistant genes from several donor <b>parents</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transferred into a single recurrent parent. To make sure each line has different resistant genes, each donor parent is used in a separate backcross program. Between five and ten of these lines may then be mixed depending upon the races of pathogen present in the region. As this process is repeated, some lines will become susceptible to the pathogen. These lines can easily be replaced with new resistant lines. As new sources of resistance become available, new lines are developed. In this way, the loss of crops is kept to a minimum, because only one or a few lines become susceptible to a pathogen within a given season, and all other crops are unaffected by the disease. Because the disease would spread more slowly than if the entire population were susceptible, this also reduces the damage to susceptible lines. There is still the possibility that a new race of pathogen will develop to which all lines are susceptible, however.|$|E

[...] Harold Zellner explains this apparent paradox {{as an integral part of}} the argument that Sappho makes that the most beautiful is the one that one loves: the apparent contradiction between Helen being the most beautiful, and Helen finding Paris the most beautiful, can be resolved if we agree with Sappho's definition of beauty.|$|E
