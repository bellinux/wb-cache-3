25|$|According to {{historian}} Akira Fujiwara, Emperor Hirohito personally {{ratified the}} decision to remove the constraints of international law (The Hague Conventions) on the treatment of Chinese prisoners {{of war in the}} directive of 5 August 1937. This notification also advised staff officers to stop using the term “prisoners of war”. The Geneva Convention exempted POWs of sergeant rank or higher from manual labour, and stipulated that prisoners performing work should be <b>provided</b> <b>with</b> <b>extra</b> rations and other essentials. Japan was not a signatory to the 1929 Geneva Convention on the Prisoners of War at the time, and Japanese forces did not follow the convention, although they ratified the 1929 Geneva Convention on the Sick And Wounded.|$|E
25|$|The {{provision}} of salt {{was a major}} logistical problem for the largest Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements. As they came to rely upon cereal foods over salty meat and fish, Neolithic cultures had to incorporate supplementary sources of salt into their diet. Similarly, domestic cattle need to be <b>provided</b> <b>with</b> <b>extra</b> sources of salt beyond their normal diet or their milk production is reduced. Cucuteni-Trypillia mega-sites, {{with a population of}} likely thousands of people and animals, are estimated to have required between 36,000 and 100,000kg of salt per year. This was not available locally, and so had to be moved in bulk from distant sources on the western Black Sea coast and in the Carpathian Mountains, probably by river.|$|E
500|$|The British {{began to}} awaken their troops at 9 pm {{on the night}} of April 18 and {{assembled}} them on the water's edge on the western end of Boston Common by 10 pm. Colonel Smith was late in arriving, and there was no organized boat-loading operation, resulting in confusion at the staging area. [...] The boats used were naval barges that were packed so tightly that there was no room to sit down. When they disembarked near Phipps Farm in Cambridge, it was into waist-deep water at midnight. After a lengthy halt to unload their gear, the regulars began their [...] march to Concord at about 2 am. During the wait they were <b>provided</b> <b>with</b> <b>extra</b> ammunition, cold salt pork, and hard sea biscuits. They did not carry knapsacks, since they would not be encamped. They carried their haversacks (food bags), canteens, muskets, and accoutrements, and marched off in wet, muddy shoes and soggy uniforms. As they marched through Menotomy, sounds of the colonial alarms throughout the countryside caused the few officers who were aware of their mission to realize they had lost the element of surprise.|$|E

2500|$|The SR Z {{class was}} {{considered}} at first, {{but due to}} the specialist characteristics of the design as a yard engine for marshalling freight, they were not deemed fit {{for the purpose of}} hauling loads under the tight timings of London's railway system. The solution was a smaller wheeled version of the ill-fated K1 class with three cylinders to allow for better acceleration, with three sets Walschaerts valve gear. The resultant W class, was designed in 1929. As a result of the rebuilding of the 'River' K1 class 2-6-4 tank engines following the Sevenoaks railway accident, the surplus bogies and leading wheels were earmarked for the new design. The 2-6-4 wheel arrangement was settled upon as being ideal for intensive suburban routes, and the use of parts from the K Class and the same boiler as used on the N, N1 and U1 classes enabled the standardization of Southern locomotives to continue. The locomotives were provided with [...] heavy braking equipment to cater for freight wagons with or without continuous brakes that were in circulation at the time. With this in mind, the class were unusually <b>provided</b> <b>with</b> <b>extra</b> braking on the bogies and trailing wheels.|$|E

50|$|Thirty-eight LSTs were {{converted}} to serve as small hospital ships and designated LSTH. They supplemented the many standard LSTs, which removed casualties from the beach after landing tanks and vehicles. LSTs had brought 41,035 wounded men back across the English Channel from Normandy by D-Day+114 (28 September 1944). Other LSTs, <b>provided</b> <b>with</b> <b>extra</b> cranes and handling gear, were used exclusively for replenishing ammunition. They possessed a special advantage in this role, as their size permitted two or three LSTs to go simultaneously alongside an anchored battleship or cruiser to accomplish replenishment more rapidly than standard ammunition ships.|$|E

50|$|The AMX-10RC {{has been}} the {{recipient}} of numerous upgrades over its lifetime. Most notably, newer systems include battlefield-management system terminals. For its part in the 1991 Gulf War, the AMX-10RC was <b>provided</b> <b>with</b> <b>extra</b> add-on armour and anti-tank missile decoy systems. One improvement considered was the installation of a NATO 105mm gun, as the GIAT model was not compatible with NATO munitions, but this was ultimately not done. Thermal imaging systems have also been installed, using units taken from decommissioned AMX-30B2 MBTs. A central tyre-inflation system is available for added traction over soft terrain. The AMX-10RC is equipped with an NBC (Nuclear/Biological/Chemical) protection system and may conduct reconnaissance in a radioactive environment.|$|E
