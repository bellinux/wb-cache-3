5|$|The Dorniers were {{devoid of}} German equipment, {{including}} engines. The Yugoslavs found a French manufacturer {{to supply the}} powerplants instead. Gnome et Rhône was the supplier chosen, and the Gnome-Rhône Mistral Major engine was {{to be used in}} the Dornier. The French had inflated the <b>performance</b> <b>data</b> of the engine, claiming it to have 649kW (870hp) and a speed of 420km/h (261mph) at 3,850m (12,320ft). The constant-speed propellers were also poor, and delivered late. This led to trials with Piaggio Aero and Ratier propellers.|$|E

5|$|An era {{came to an}} end in 1668 {{with two}} events: Davenant died suddenly, leaving a messy {{ownership}} situation for the Duke's Company, and Pepys' eyesight forced him to stop keeping a diary. Thomas Betterton, though formally a minority shareholder, continued to run the Duke's Company, and, in the spirit of Davenant, commissioned the most elaborate of the Restoration playhouses, the theatre at Dorset Garden (or Dorset Gardens), with a flat for himself on top. Although the Dorset Garden Theatre quickly became a famous and glamorous venue, very little is concretely known about the building and outfitting of it: a vague and undocumented tradition ascribes its design to Christopher Wren. The absence of Pepys' record means that <b>performance</b> <b>data</b> for the next decades are only patchily known.|$|E
5|$|By late Friday night, {{they had}} laid {{out what was}} {{essentially}} a new airplane. The new design (464-49) built upon the basic layout of the B-47 Stratojet with 35 degree swept wings, eight engines paired in four underwing pods, and bicycle landing gear with wingtip outrigger wheels. A notable feature of the landing gear was the ability to pivot the main landing gear up to 20° from the aircraft centerline to increase safety during crosswind landings. After {{a trip to a}} hobby shop for supplies, Schairer set to work building a model. The rest of the team focused on weight and <b>performance</b> <b>data.</b> Wells, who was also a skilled artist, completed the aircraft drawings. On Sunday, a stenographer was hired to type a clean copy of the proposal. On Monday, Schairer presented Colonel Warden with a neatly bound 33-page proposal and a 14-inch scale model. The aircraft was projected to exceed all design specifications.|$|E
5|$|The E Series 3 was {{announced}} in September 2010. It carried the same motor and drivetrain as before, and only {{minor changes to the}} exterior. In this series HSV focused on changes to the interior of the car as well as major upgrades to the computer systems and a new electronic interface called the HSV Enhanced Driver Interface. External changes included the shock wave exhaust tips and grilles and new HID Xenon adaptive projector headlamps. The control panel changes included a new 'Oracle Dash' with upgraded trip computer, tire pressure monitors and fuel statistics; the center console was reworked, introducing the Holden touchscreen IQ system and the HSV EDI <b>performance</b> <b>data</b> logging system (similar to the Nissan GT-R), which displays real-time information on engine speed, brakes, gear shifts, g-forces on the car, steering angle, fuel economy, stability control, Magnetic Ride Control suspension, car dynamics, Bi-Modal Exhaust, battery voltage, oil pressure, power, torque, elevation, exhaust pressure, intake manifold pressure and air intake temp. The system includes preloaded race track locations, stop watches and track maps, satellite navigation, digital radio, Bluetooth, optional DVD player and ability to download data onto a PC using the Motech i2 software. The E Series 3 introduced (SBZA) Side Blind Zone Alert which uses ultrasonic sensors to alert drivers of traffic obstructions in blind spots. Using the HSV EDI the driver can customize operation of the car by for example turning off stability control and controlling the Bi-Modal Exhaust. The E Series 3 offered the option of HSV LPI (Liquid Propane Injection), an LPG Autogas system which allows the use of liquid propane as an alternative fuel. The LPI is controlled by the car's ECU and seamlessly changes from petrol to LPG when the engine has reached optimum temperature (when maximum engine power is required, the system automatically switches back to petrol).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to use neural networks for predicting Islamic banks <b>performance.</b> A <b>data</b> sample of twenty six Islamic banks has been collected for the period 1991 - 1993. Seven financial ratios were constructed from the data sample. Kohonen neural network was used first to group the Islamic banks into high and low performance groups using the seven financial ratios for the performance year (1993). The results of this network have assigned twelve banks to the high performance group and fourteen banks to the low performance group. Using these results, a three layers Backpropagation neural network was built to predict the Islamic banks performance. The network was trained on the one year prior to the <b>performance</b> year <b>data</b> set while using the <b>performance</b> year <b>data</b> as a test set. The two year prior to the <b>performance</b> year <b>data</b> set was used as a holdout sample to check the network prediction abilities. When the network was applied, the results showed high prediction abilities and generalization. It correctly classified all the Islamic banks on the performance year and on the one year prior data sets. It also correctly classified 89 % of the banks on the two years prior data set which was unseen by the network. I...|$|R
