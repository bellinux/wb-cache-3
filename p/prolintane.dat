50|$|<b>Prolintane</b> (Catovit, Katovit, Promotil, Villescon) is a {{stimulant}} and norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor {{developed in}} the 1950s. It is closely related in chemical structure to other drugs such as pyrovalerone, MDPV, and propylhexedrine {{and it has a}} similar mechanism of action. Many cases of <b>prolintane</b> abuse have been reported.|$|E
50|$|Teurajärvi tested {{positive}} for <b>prolintane</b> at the 1982 Finnish Skiing Championships and was subsequently handed a one-year ban from sport for the anti-doping rule violation.|$|E
50|$|All {{of these}} {{compounds}} differ from PEP {{in that the}} alpha carbon is extended and a ketone {{is attached to the}} beta carbon (with the exception of <b>prolintane),</b> among other modifications.|$|E
5000|$|... α-Pyrrolidinopentiophenone (also {{known as}} α-pyrrolidinovalerophenone, α-PVP, O-2387, β-keto-prolintane, Prolintanone, or Desmethyl Pyrovalerone) is a {{synthetic}} stimulant of the cathinone class {{developed in the}} 1960s that has been sold as a designer drug. Colloquially it is sometimes called flakka or gravel. α-PVP is chemically related to pyrovalerone and is the ketone analog of <b>prolintane.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pyrovalerone (Centroton, 4-Methyl-β-keto-prolintane, Thymergix, O-2371) is a {{psychoactive drug}} with {{stimulant}} effects via {{acting as a}} norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), and {{is used for the}} clinical treatment of chronic fatigue or lethargy and as an anorectic or appetite suppressant for weight loss purposes. It was developed in the late 1960s and has since been used in France and several other European countries, and although pyrovalerone is still occasionally prescribed, it is used infrequently due to problems with abuse and dependence. It is closely related on a structural level to a number of other stimulants, such as MDPV and <b>prolintane</b> (Promotil, Katovit).|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{drugs have}} DRI action {{and have been}} or are used clinically specifically for this property: amineptine, dexmethylphenidate, difemetorex, fencamfamine, lefetamine, levophacetoperane, medifoxamine, mesocarb, methylphenidate, nomifensine, pipradrol, <b>prolintane,</b> and pyrovalerone. The following drugs are or have been used clinically and possess only weak DRI action, {{which may or may}} not be clinically-relevant: adrafinil, armodafinil, bupropion, mazindol, modafinil, nefazodone, sertraline, and sibutramine. The following drugs are or have been clinically used but only coincidentally have DRI properties: benzatropine, diphenylpyraline, etybenzatropine, ketamine, nefopam, pethidine (meperidine), and tripelennamine. The following are a selection of some particularly notably abused DRIs: cocaine, ketamine, MDPV, naphyrone, and phencyclidine (PCP). Amphetamines, including amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA, cathinone, methcathinone, mephedrone, and methylone, are all DRIs as well, but are distinct in that they also behave, and potentially more potently as dopamine releasing agents (DRAs) (it should be noted that due to Yerkes-Dodson's law, 'more potently stimulated' may not equal more optimally functionally stimulated). There are very distinct differences in the mode of action between dopamine releasers/substrates & dopamine re-uptake inhibitors; the former are functionally entropy-driven (i.e. relating to hydrophobicity) and the latter are enthalpy-driven (i.e. relating conformational change). Reuptake inhibitors such as cocaine induce hyperpolarization of cloned human DAT upon oocytes that are naturally found on neurons, whereas releasing agents induce de-polarization of the neuron membrane.|$|E
40|$|Comprehensive {{two-dimensional}} {{gas chromatography}} (GC×GC) now occupies a niche within the GC technology regime. The technique is undeniably {{unique in the}} manner in which the experiment is conducted, the way results are presented and the interpretive opportunities offered. For the 1000 th volume of this journal it is appropriate to expand upon these features, and review the progress made in GC×GC to date. Firstly, brief general comment is made on multidimensional procedures, and to review key aspects of GC×GC. The use of the targeted multidimensional GC method allows absolute retentions in the second dimension of a GC×GC experiment to be estimated, and also offers a novel way to obtain enhanced response for resolved solutes. Then, to illustrate the utility of the technique, the application of GC×GC to the screening of drugs and their metabolites in biological fluids is described using <b>prolintane</b> metabolites in canine urine as an example, with samples taken at four time intervals after administration. This example illustrates the first application of GC×GC in the field of forensic toxicology, an area traditionally dominated by GC-MS. Most drug compounds were found to be retained on the 0. 8 -m second column for a greater time than the modulation period (3 s) used for initial analysis, under the conditions described. Hence a 0. 4 -m D 2 BPX 50 (50 % phenyl methyl polysilphenylene) column was then used throughout, with most compounds retained less than 4 s. For the standard drug mixture, three overlapping drugs on the first dimension column (BPX 5) were subsequently baseline resolved on the BPX 50 column. For <b>prolintane</b> administration samples, the parent drug and metabolites could be effectively resolved from background matrix peaks. Likewise a 23 -drug spike standard in horse urine blank gave acceptable resolution of the drugs from matrix peaks...|$|E
