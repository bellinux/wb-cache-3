25|$|Based {{on animal}} studies, <b>parathion</b> is {{considered}} by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to be a possible human carcinogen. Studies show that <b>parathion</b> is toxic to fetuses, but does not cause birth defects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Parathion</b> is {{toxic to}} bees, fish, birds, {{and other forms}} of wildlife.|$|E
25|$|Safety {{concerns}} have later {{led to the}} development of <b>parathion</b> methyl, which is somewhat less toxic.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, the EPA banned most uses of methyl <b>parathion</b> and azinphos methyl, {{citing the}} risks they pose to children. Both methyl <b>parathion</b> and azinphos methyl are organophosphates. Organophosphates are {{pesticides}} that kill insects by disrupting nerve impulses. Unfortunately, these pesticides {{have the same}} effect on humans. In 2000, the EPA banned another organophosphate, (chlorpyrifos), that was common in the agriculture industry, household cleaners and commercial pest control products, due to a study showing that chlorpyrifos caused weakness, vomiting and diarrhea in baby rats.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{non-governmental}} organisation Pesticide Action Network or PAN, <b>parathion</b> {{is one of}} the most dangerous pesticides. This organization lists <b>parathion</b> also as a 'bad actor chemical'. In the US alone more than 650 agricultural workers have been poisoned since 1966, of which 100 died. In underdeveloped countries many more people have suffered fatal and nonfatal intoxications. The World Health Organization, PAN and numerous environmental organisations propose a general and global ban. Its use is banned or restricted in 23 countries and its import is illegal in a total of 50 countries.|$|E
25|$|<b>Parathion</b> is {{synthesized}} from diethyl dithiophosphoric acid (C2H5O)2PS2H by chlorination {{to generate}} diethylthiophosphoryl chloride ((C2H5O)2P(S)Cl). In a salt metathesis reaction, the chloride treated with sodium 4-nitrophenolate (the {{sodium salt of}} 4-nitrophenol).|$|E
25|$|<b>Parathion</b> {{was used}} as a {{chemical}} warfare agent, most notably by an element of the British South Africa Police (BSAP) attached to the Selous Scouts during the Rhodesian Bush War.|$|E
25|$|When pure, <b>parathion</b> {{is a white}} {{crystalline}} solid. It {{is commonly}} distributed as a brown liquid that smells of rotting eggs or garlic. The insecticide is somewhat stable, although it darkens when exposed to sunlight.|$|E
25|$|Following World War II, the {{development}} of new pesticides such as DDT enabled U.S. farmers again to grow cotton as an economic crop. DDT was initially extremely effective, but U.S. weevil populations developed resistance by the mid-1950s. Methyl <b>parathion,</b> malathion, and pyrethroids were subsequently used, but environmental and resistance concerns arose as they had with DDT, and control strategies changed.|$|E
25|$|To {{provide the}} end user {{with a minimum}} {{standard}} of protection, suitable protective gloves, clothing, and a respirator with organic-vapour cartridges is normally worn. Industrial safety during the production process requires special ventilation and continuous measurement of air contamination {{in order not to}} exceed PEL levels, as well as careful attention to personal hygiene. Frequent analysis of workers' serum acetylcholinesterase activity is also helpful with regards to occupational safety, because the action of <b>parathion</b> is cumulative. Also, atropine {{has been used as a}} specific antidote.|$|E
500|$|Many {{pesticides}} are enzyme inhibitors. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is {{an enzyme}} found in animals from insects to humans. [...] It {{is essential to}} nerve cell function through its mechanism of breaking down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into its constituents, acetate and choline. [...] This is somewhat unusual among neurotransmitters as most, including serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, are absorbed from the synaptic cleft rather than cleaved. [...] A large number of AChE inhibitors are used in both medicine and agriculture. [...] Reversible competitive inhibitors, such as edrophonium, physostigmine, and neostigmine, {{are used in the}} treatment of myasthenia gravis and in anaesthesia. [...] The carbamate pesticides are also examples of reversible AChE inhibitors. [...] The organophosphate pesticides such as malathion, <b>parathion,</b> and chlorpyrifos irreversibly inhibit acetylcholinesterase.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Parathion</b> acts on {{the enzyme}} {{acetylcholinesterase}} indirectly. [...] After an insect (or a human) ingests <b>parathion,</b> an oxidase replaces the double bonded sulfur with oxygen to give paraoxon.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Parathion,</b> {{also called}} parathion-ethyl or diethyl <b>parathion</b> and locally known as [...] "Folidol", is an {{organophosphate}} compound possessing a organothiophosphate group. It {{is a potent}} insecticide and acaricide. It was originally developed by IG Farben in the 1940s. It is highly toxic to non-target organisms, including humans. [...] Its use is banned or restricted in many countries, and there are proposals to ban it from all use. The basic structure is shared by <b>parathion</b> methyl.|$|E
2500|$|Degradation {{proceeds}} differently under [...] conditions: the {{nitro group}} on <b>parathion</b> {{is reduced to}} the amine.|$|E
2500|$|Degradation of <b>parathion</b> {{leads to}} more {{water-soluble}} products. [...] Hydrolysis, which deactivates the molecule, occurs at the aryl ester bond resulting in diethyl thiophosphate and 4-nitrophenol.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Parathion</b> was {{developed}} by Gerhard Schrader for the German trust IG Farben in the 1940s. [...] After {{the war and the}} collapse of IG Farben due to the war crime trials, the Western allies seized the patent, and <b>parathion</b> was marketed worldwide by different companies and under different brand names. The most common German brand was E605 (banned in Germany after 2002); this was not a food-additive [...] "E number" [...] as used in the EU today. [...] "E" [...] stands for Entwicklungsnummer (German for [...] "development number"). [...] It is an irreversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.|$|E
2500|$|As a pesticide, <b>parathion</b> is {{generally}} applied by spraying. [...] It is often applied to cotton, rice and fruit trees. The usual concentrations of ready-to-use solutions are 0.05 to 0.1%. The chemical is banned {{for use on}} many food crops.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Parathion</b> is a cholinesterase inhibitor. It {{generally}} {{disrupts the}} nervous system by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase. It is absorbed via skin, mucous membranes, and orally. Absorbed <b>parathion</b> is rapidly metabolized to paraoxon, as described in Insecticidal activity. Paraoxon exposure can result in headaches, convulsions, poor vision, vomiting, abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, unconsciousness, tremor, dyspnea, and finally lung-edema as well as respiratory arrest. [...] Symptoms of poisoning are known to last for extended periods, sometimes months. The most common and very specific antidote is atropine, in doses of up to 100mg daily. Because atropine may also be toxic, {{it is recommended that}} small frequently repeated doses be used in treatment. If human poisoning is detected early and the treatment is prompt (atropine and artificial respiration), fatalities are infrequent. Insufficient oxygen will lead to cerebral hypoxia and permanent brain damage. [...] Peripheral neuropathy including paralysis is noticed as late sequelae after recovery from acute intoxication. <b>Parathion</b> and related organophosphorus pesticides are used in hundreds of thousands of poisonings annually, especially suicides. It is known as [...] "Schwiegermuttergift" [...] (mother-in-law poison) in Germany. For this reason, most formulations contain a blue dye providing warning.|$|E
2500|$|The {{chemicals}} most {{used in the}} Rhodesian {{program were}} <b>parathion</b> (an organophosphate insecticide) and thallium (a heavy metal commonly found in rodenticide). The weapons the Rhodesians selected for use also included Vibrio cholerae (causative agent of cholera) and possibly Bacillus anthracis [...] (causative agent of anthrax). [...] They also looked at using Rickettsia prowazekii (causative agent of epidemic typhus), and Salmonella typhi (causative agent of typhoid fever), and toxins—such as ricin and botulinum toxin.|$|E

5000|$|... 2. Organophosphates, e.g. <b>parathion,</b> methyl <b>parathion</b> {{and about}} 40 other {{insecticides}} are available nationally. <b>Parathion</b> is highly toxic, methyl-parathion is less so and Malathion {{is generally considered}} safe as it has low toxicity and is rapidly broken down in the mammalian liver. This group works by preventing normal nerve transmission as cholinesterase is prevented from breaking down the transmitter substance acetylcholine, resulting in uncontrolled muscle movements.|$|E
50|$|The next morning, {{after the}} death of the last child, Dianne, a two-pound sack of <b>parathion</b> was {{discovered}} in the shed. Cline, Barnard, their staffs, and Shaub all agreed that the bag of <b>parathion</b> had not been there the day before, when the premises had been searched five times. They thought that whoever had placed the <b>parathion</b> sack was also probably the person who had poisoned the children. Conflicting reports on how the <b>parathion</b> sack was found were given to law enforcement officers. Minoughan was the first officer to arrive and was told by Bessie Reece, the babysitter, that Charlie Smith, a black resident of Arcadia’s Quarters, had discovered the <b>parathion.</b> When Minoughan asked Barnard who called in the discovery to the police station, he was informed that it was an anonymous male caller.|$|E
