40|$|This article {{describes}} central {{features of the}} mass transport during the coagulation in water of cellulose- 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazoium acetate ([C 2 mim][OAc]) solutions, namely, that the diffusivities are mainly affected by the relative concentrations of water and [C 2 mim][OAc], that the concentration of cellulose does not affect diffusivities and coagulation rates, that the diffusivities of low-Mw compounds {{are similar to those}} in aqueous [C 2 mim][OAc] solutions without macromolecules, that the polymer concentration is diluted by the large influx of coagulant causing a positive net mass gain, NMG, from diffusive fluxes, and that such NMG, although observed only as a function in time, is also a function in space that has local peaks significantly higher than the mean NMG value. The conclusion from the first three findings was that the diffusion advances through a liquid phase which possesses a continuous pore network and most of the volume. The <b>precipitated</b> <b>cellulose</b> is concentrated into fibrils whose inhibitive effect on the diffusion of small molecules through the surrounding phase is marginal. This key understanding about mass transport during coagulation also simplifies numerical modeling significantly...|$|E

40|$|Persil Çetinkol, Özgül (Dogus Author) In the {{biochemical}} {{conversion of}} lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels, {{the process of}} pretreatment is currently {{one of the most}} difficult and expensive operations. The use of ionic liquids (ILs) in biomass pretreatment has received considerable attention recently because of their effectiveness at decreasing biomass recalcitrance to subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis. In addition, ILs have the potential for decreasing the need for corrosive or toxic chemicals and associated waste streams that can be generated by other pretreatment methods that utilize acids and/or bases. In this article, we address two significant challenges to the realization of a practical IL pretreatment process. First, we describe a mixture containing specific proportions of a ketone and an alcohol that <b>precipitates</b> <b>cellulose</b> and lignocellulosic biomass from solutions of the IL 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium acetate without the formation of intermediate gel phases. Second, an IL recovery process is described that removes lignin and most residual IL solutes and that minimizes energy and solvent use. These two techniques are demonstrated by the pretreatment of 100 g of corn stover with the recovery of 89 % of the initial IL and separate corn stover fractions rich in glucans, xylans, lignin, and non-polar substances. These results highlight one potential approach towards the realization of a scalable ionic liquid pretreatment process technology that enables ionic liquid recovery and reuse...|$|R

40|$|This work {{discusses}} {{the suitability of}} supercritical water treatment (SCWT) for depolymerising microcrystalline cellulose in a controlled way. The SCWT partially hydrolysed cellulose down to a mixture of three valuable products: water-insoluble low-molecular-weight <b>cellulose</b> (WI-LMWC) <b>precipitate,</b> water-soluble low-molecular-weight <b>cellulose</b> (WS-LMWC) oligomers, and glucose. The conditions under which the energy demand for obtaining these products is minimised were identified by adjusting the reaction time inside the continuous reactor and the temperature around the critical point. The optimum conditions were 370 °C and 0. 4 seconds for producing WI-LMWC and 360 °C and 0. 5 seconds for producing WS-LMWC, with maximum yields of 19 wt% and 50 wt%, respectively. This work also shows that the water-insoluble product <b>precipitates</b> into crystalline <b>cellulose</b> II arrangements.

Subsequently serum protein electrophoresis was performed on normal serum samples and also on four serum samples containing precipitates using an automated electrophoresis system on cellulose acetate strips.

40|$|A novel {{process has}} been {{developed}} for separation of the cellulose, i. e. cotton and viscose, from blended-fibers waste textiles. An environmentally friendly cellulose solvent, N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO) {{was used in this}} process for separation and pretreatment of the cellulose. This solvent was mixed with blended-fibers textiles at 120 degrees C and atmospheric pressure to dissolve the cellulose and separate it from the undissolved non-cellulosic fibers. Water was then added to the solution in order to <b>precipitate</b> the <b>cellulose,</b> while both water and NMMO were reused after separation by evaporation. The cellulose was then either hydrolyzed by cellulase enzymes followed by fermentation to ethanol, or digested directly to produce biogas. The process was verified by testing 50 / 50 polyester/cotton and 40 / 60 polyester/viscose-blended textiles. The polyesters were purified as fibers after the NMMO treatments, and up to 95 % of the cellulose fibers were regenerated and collected on a filter. A 2 -day enzymatic hydrolysis and 1 -day fermentation of the regenerated cotton and viscose resulted in 48 and 50 g ethanol/g regenerated cellulose, which were 85 % and 89 % of the theoretical yields, respectively. This process also resulted in a significant increase of the biogas production rate. While untreated cotton and viscose fibers were converted to methane by respectively, 0. 02 % and 1. 91 % of their theoretical yields in 3 days of digestion, the identical NMMO-treated fibers resulted into about 30 % of yield at the same period of time...|$|R
40|$|Water-soluble cello-oligosaccharides and water-insoluble, low {{molecular}} weight cellulose polymers can be produced by controlled cellulose depolymerization of cellulose using supercritical water treatment. The products from the hydrolysis and dissolution of microcrystalline cellulose were investigated after a treatment at temperature range of 320 to 390 degrees Celsius and residence time range of 0. 1 to 0. 8 seconds. Four cellulosic product fractions were identified, quantified, and characterized using gravimetric and chromatographic techniques. The four fractions consisted of solid cellulosic residue, solid cellulosic precipitate, water-soluble cello-oligosaccharides, and water-soluble degradation products. The water-insoluble, {{low molecular}} mass cellulose polymers accounted for up to 25 {{percent of the total}} products. In addition, glucose and cello-oligosaccharides of degree of polymerization up to cellodecaose accounted for up to 65 percent of the total products. Furthermore, the water-soluble fraction was significantly purified using membrane ultrafiltration.

30|$|The mixed {{wastewater}} of {{viscose fiber}} is mainly {{used in the}} industrial degradation. A large number of <b>cellulose</b> <b>precipitate</b> was formed after acid and alkaline wastewater were mixed (pH =  2 – 3) in the industrial degradation.

Several physical and chemical methods {{have been used to}} treat wastewater and improve the degradation efficiency of CODCr (Hamaguchi et al. 2013; Kang et al. 2012). However, the cost is too high and the equipment covers a large area. In contrast, biological processes are the most environmental friendly and economical (Miao et al. 2009). However, no microorganism has been reported that can directly degrade viscose fiber wastewater, due to the complex composition of viscose fiber wastewater, most of which are cellulose, lignin, organic pollutants, and other large molecular substances (Liang et al. 2009; Vikman et al. 2002). It has been observed that few microorganisms can degrade macromolecular substance under high salinity condition (Kanaly and Harayama 2000).|$|R
40|$|Cellulose II {{structure}} was obtained when <b>cellulose</b> <b>precipitated</b> from NMMO/H 2 O/cellulose solution by adding excess water. The regenerated cellulose was {{three times more}} reactive than that of untreated cellulose in hydrolysis reactions. X-ray diffraction (XRD), C- 13 Solid-State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy were used to investigate interactions between N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO) and cellulose. Cellulose NMMO solid mixtures were heated to various temperatures and cooled to room temperature. The presence of cellulose in cellulose NMMO solid mixture decreased the NMMO melting point by 80 - 110 degrees C and hampered NMMO recrystallizing during cooling process. NMMO crystal structure collapsed between 70 and 100 degrees C in cellulose NMMO mixture and became very mobile (liquid like form). Mobile NMMO molecules transformed crystalline cellulose into amorphous cellulose. When the cellulose NMMO mixture was heated to 150 degrees C, cellulose started to replace H 2 O molecules that hydrogen-bonded to NMMO. Our FTIR spectra results suggest that released H 2 O molecules exist as both adsorbed H 2 O molecules on cellulose and unbound H 2 O molecules that are physically confined in cellulose matrix.

40|$|The deconstruction and {{upgrading}} of lignocellulosic biomass {{dissolved in}} ionic liquids was studied {{as a potential}} alternative route to products traditionally synthesized from petroleum. While domestic biomass is a cheaper, lower carbon emission, alternative feedstock to petroleum, its utilization requires the selective deconstruction of the biopolymer to monomeric sugars and upgrading of the sugars to higher value products. Since biomass is soluble in ionic liquids, there {{is the opportunity to}} do both the deconstruction and secondary upgrading using "one-pot" homogeneous catalysis. 	The primary focus of this work was to understand the kinetics of both biomass deconstruction and secondary sugar chemistry in ionic liquids. Biomass is a complex collection of molecules that consists of three primary components, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Since cellulose is the primary component, accounting for roughly 45 wt% of the raw biomass on a dry basis, initial studies aimed to understand the hydrolysis of dissolved cellulose to its sugar residue glucose. Using microcrystalline Avicel cellulose as a model, the rate laws and activation energies of cellulose hydrolysis and glucose dehydration were determined in the ionic liquid 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride ([Bmim][Cl]). No evidence of oligosaccharides was observed, suggesting that hydrolysis occurs preferentially at chain ends and is irreversible. Gradually adding water to the reaction solution, so as not to <b>precipitate</b> <b>cellulose</b> but also limit the secondary dehydration of the resulting glucose to 5 -hydroxymethyl furfural (5 -HMF), significantly increased glucose yield and limited production of degradation products (humins). Several mechanisms were proposed to explain the effects of water, and possible routes to humin formation. 	While understanding the reactivity of model compounds is important to the development of biomass conversion technologies, it is critical to understand how the components of biomass react in their native form. An investigation was carried out to compare the reactivity of cellulose and hemicellulose model compounds to both pretreated and miscanthus grass in 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride ([Emim][Cl]). Activation energies of model compounds were compared with the native component in raw biomass. Significant rate decreases in hydrolysis of the cellulosic and hemicellulosic components in raw biomass compared to Avicel and Xylan from Birchwood were attributed to the interaction of lignin with the biopolymers in raw biomass. However, reaction of two pretreated substrates with varying degrees of delignification showed that the presence of lignin did not have a detrimental effect on hydrolysis, but instead suggested that breaking the raw biomass macrostructures is the key to improving hydrolysis of the biopolymers. Gradual water addition strategies further improved saccharine yield, but left the cellulosic component incompletely hydrolyzed. This unhydrolyzed cellulosic component could be further converted by varying the temperature, acid concentration, or performing a second hydrolysis on the reactor residue. 	After demonstrating the ability to generate sugars in high yield from miscanthus, we investigated the selective conversion of glucose to 5 -HMF in ionic liquids using metal chlorides. Chromium chloride, CrCl 2, has been proposed to isomerize glucose to fructose, which is readily dehydrated to 5 -HMF in imidazolium chloride ionic liquids without an added catalyst. We began by studying the kinetics of fructose dehydration in [Emim][Cl] and investigating the effects of CrCl 2 on the dehydration to 5 -HMF. Then the kinetics of glucose isomerization to fructose using CrCl 2 were characterized and compared to the rate and activation energy for fructose dehydration. Using the data for fructose, a model for the kinetics of fructose dehydration and isomerization in the presence of CrCl 2 was developed. When the model was applied to glucose, it failed to describe the large conversion of glucose and small yields of 5 -HMF in the initial reaction period. The accuracy of the model could be improved by including an intermediate in the glucose to fructose dehydration, which highlighted the need to characterize intermediates and products formed during dehydration using more detailed spectroscopic techniques than chromatography. 	Finally, we conducted in-situ 13 C NMR experiments to characterize the intermediates and products formed and to understand the effect of the ionic liquid solvent on glucose dehydration to 5 -HMF catalyzed by metal chlorides in [Emim][Cl]. Compared to H 2 O, glucose dissolved in [Emim][Cl] exhibited higher equilibrium concentrations of the furanose and acyclic isomers of glucose. These isomers were observed to undergo dehydration more rapidly than the pyranose isomers of glucose. The rate of anomerization was also found to be faster in [Emim][Cl], a process that may facilitate ring opening in several proposed mechanisms for glucose dehydration. In situ catalytic studies were conducted using WCl 6, which concluded that fructose is not formed as the reactive intermediate, but rather glucose first undergoes partial dehydration, before it is transformed from its unreactive aldose form to the more reactive ketose form. Using these observations, combined with studies of glucose dehydration catalyzed by H 2 SO 4 several mechanisms were proposed to explain the progressive dehydration of glucose to 5 -HMF using metal chlorides...|$|R
40|$|Ionic liquids, ILs, have {{recently}} been studied with accelerating interest {{to be used for}} a deconstruction/fractionation, dissolution or pretreatment processing method of lignocellulosic biomass. ILs are usually utilized combined with heat. Regarding lignocellulosic recalcitrance toward fractionation and IL utilization, most of the studies concern IL utilization in the biomass fermentation process prior to the enzymatic hydrolysis step. It has been demonstrated that IL-pretreatment gives more efficient hydrolysis of the biomass polysaccharides than enzymatic hydrolysis alone. Both cellulose (especially cellulose) and lignin are very resistant towards fractionation and even dissolution methods. As an example, it can be mentioned that softwood, hardwood and grass-type plant species have different types of lignin structures leading to the fact that softwood lignin (guaiacyl lignin dominates) is the most difficult to solubilize or chemically disrupt. In addition to the known conventional biomass processing methods, several ILs have also been found to efficiently dissolve either cellulose and/or wood samples – different ILs are suitable for different purposes. An IL treatment of wood usually results in non-fibrous pulp, where lignin is not efficiently separated and wood components are selectively <b>precipitated,</b> as <b>cellulose</b> is not soluble or degradable in ionic liquids under mild conditions. Nevertheless, new ILs capable of rather good fractionation performance {{have recently}} emerged. The capability of the IL to dissolve or deconstruct wood or cellulose depends on several factors, (e. g. sample origin, the particle size of the biomass, mechanical treatments as pulverization, initial biomassto-IL ratio, water content of the biomass, possible impurities of IL, reaction conditions, temperature etc). The aim {{of this study was to}} obtain (fermentable) saccharides and other valuable chemicals from wood by a combined heat and IL-treatment. Thermal treatments alone contribute to the degradation of polysaccharides (e. g. 150 °C alone is said to cause the degradation of polysaccharides), thus temperatures below that should be used, if the research interest lies on the IL effectiveness. On the other hand, the efficiency of the IL-treatment can also be enhanced to combine other treatment methods, (e. g. microwave heating). The samples of spruce, pine and birch sawdust were treated with either 1 -Ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride, Emim Cl, or 1 -Ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium acetate, Emim Ac, (or with ionized water for comparison) at various temperatures (where focus was between 80 and 120 °C). The samples were withdrawn at fixed time intervals (the main interest treatment time area lied between 0 and 100 hours). Double experiments were executed. The selected mono- and disaccharides, as well as their known degradation products, 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural, 5 -HMF, and furfural were analyzed with capillary electrophoresis, CE, and high-performance liquid chromatography, HPLC. Initially, even GC and GC-MS were utilized. Galactose, glucose, mannose and xylose were the main monosaccharides that were present in the wood samples exposed to ILs at elevated temperatures; in addition, furfural and 5 -HMF were detected; moreover, the quantitative amount of the two latter ones were naturally increasing in line with the heating time or the IL:wood ratio...|$|R
30|$|The {{regeneration}} {{process was}} explained by Zavrel et al. describing that ions of the IL are extracted into the aqueous phase through hydrogen bonding, dipolar and Coulombic forces [26, 70]. Basically, water molecules form hydrodynamic shells around ions of the IL disrupting the direct interactions of IL ions with cellulose. Thus, intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds are rebuilt and <b>cellulose</b> <b>precipitates</b> [26]. However, not only cellulose can be dissolved but also other compounds of lignocellulose {{interact with the}} IL ions, such as hemicellulose and lignin. Singh et al. stated that the addition of water to switchgrass pre-treated in [emim][CH 3 COO] results in the precipitation of carbohydrates for downstream processing and lignin appears to be partially extracted in the IL/water mixture [31]. The degree of delignification and interaction of lignin with the precipitating solvent, IL, or cellulose dictate {{the purity of the}} regenerated cellulose for further saccharification and sugar yield [31]. Leskinen et al. evaluated the precipitation and composition of the regenerated samples from wood sawdust treatment with [amim][Cl] [35]. In the obtained regenerated material the lignin content increased due to the absence of delignification and simultaneous dissolution of some polysaccharide components. However, Nguyen et al. presented that lignin is firstly removed in the pre-treatment of rice straw with [emim][CH 3 COO] [51]. This may indicate differences in the mode of dissolution between [amim][Cl] and [emim][CH 3 COO] or it may also result from differences between biomass used in both studies. A more accurate correlation between lignin removal and the reduction of cellulose crystallinity was approached in a work of Tan et al. [71] Lignin content in the regenerated material was found to be proportional to the CrI. Thus, when more lignin is retained in the regenerated material, higher CrI is observed. The possible explanation comes from the movement restriction of cellulose in the presence of lignin that causes the dissolved cellulose to rearrange into the same conformation upon recrystallisation. Thus, the crystallinity of cellulose remains relatively high if pre-treatment was not efficient in lignin removal [71]. For lignocellulosic materials that contain relatively large amounts of lignin, higher temperature is required to change the structural crystallinity of cellulose I to cellulose II [59].|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} the {{applications}} of ionic liquids (ILs), especially carboxylate-based ILs. The first part describes the syntheses and uses of ILs as solvents for natural compounds to dissolve cellulose and to extract betulin. The second part reveals their applications as reactants for esterification and ionic tagging. Dissolution of cellulose allows easier processing of this important biogenic feedstock. For this, ILs have been proposed. To foster understanding of the structure activity relationship of IL and cellulose and to provide mandatory data for computer-aided cellulose solvent design, a systematic approach towards the synthesis and experimental determination was carried out and is described in Chapter 2. Three homologous series of all 27 combinations of the three cations: 1, 3 -dimethylimidazolium ([DMIm]), 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium ([EMIm]), and N,N-diethyl-N,N-dimethylammonium ([DEDMN]) with nine carboxylate anions were synthesized and characterized. Cellulose solubilities in seventeen synthesized ILs were determined. Alternatives were found to the most widely studied cellulose solvent [EMIm]Ac. Generally, the cellulose solubilities for carboxylate-based ILs with imidazolium cations {{were found to be}} in the same range, whereas those with the quaternary ammonium cation were found to be poor solvents for cellulose. Anions with an internal hydrogen bond had no detectable cellulose solubility. Moreover, anions with high beta values exhibited good solubilities, which confirmed that anion basicity was an important factor for dissolving cellulose. After addition of water to the cellulose-IL solution, the <b>cellulose</b> <b>precipitated</b> and the IL was readily recovered. The pretreated cellulose was shown to be more degradable with organic acid. Furthermore, the regenerated IL showed no apparent change when compared to the fresh one, showing good thermal and chemical stability. Moreover, carboxylate-based ILs were shown to be good solvents for the extraction of betulin from birch bark. Based on the unexpected reaction of [EMIm]Ac with dichloromethane, ILs as reactants for esterification and ionic tagging were developed, detailed in Chapter 3. The esterification of carboxylate-based ILs and alkyl halides was performed with moderate to excellent yields (33 - 99 %) for a large substrate scope under neat conditions. Its SN 2 mechanism provided a potential application in the configuration inversion of chiral alcohols. Additionally, chiral carboxylate-based ILs were tested for stereoselective esterifications with racemic electrophiles by kinetic resolution. In the preliminary results, 2 -octyl lactate was obtained with a diastereoselectivity (d. r. = 57 / 43). Due to the high polarity of ILs, weakly polar products were readily separated via decantation or extraction. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the ILs could be recovered into the reactants by three processes (the anion exchange resin method, the recyclable base DBU process, and the anion metathesis method). The disclosed reaction of 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium cation and chloromethyl acetate, which was yielded from the esterification of acetate and dichloromethane, offered a possibility to functionalize imidazolium cation at the 2 -position with formaldehyde or ROCH 2 X compounds. A series of N-alkyl-N'-alkyl- 2 -hydroxymethyl- imidazolium cations was synthesized including a polymer containing ionic liquid-type structures. When a zwitterion N-alkyl-N'-alkylimidazolium- 2 -carboxylate as the starting material was employed, 2 -hydroxymethylimidazolium-based ILs with various anions were obtained easily and products were separated readily. Furthermore, the resulting N-alkyl-N'-alkyl- 2 -hydroxymethylimidazolium cations were successfully grafted on two phosphorus ligands as ionic tags to facilitate catalyst separation in transition metal catalysis in ILs. Their effectiveness to reduce metal leaching was demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of producing all-cellulose composites (ACCs) films from dissolving wood pulp by partial {{dissolution of the}} cellulose was investigated. It was thought that the undissolved fraction of the cellulose fibres would have a reinforcing effect on the final product. The ionic liquid 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride (BmimCl) was used to dissolve sheets of the dissolving wood pulp on a laboratory scale. Before the cellulose sheets could be produced, the recovery of BmimCl was considered. Reuse of the solvent was important for the process to be cost effective and environmentally benign. Since little published information existed on the rinsing process to recover the solvent, a rinsing method was developed. The rinsing was performed using sequential rinsing stages with demineralised water. Increasing {{the temperature of the}} rinsing water was found to improve the efficiency of the rinsing stage and to accelerate the recovery of BmimCl. When the rinsing water was heated to 80 °C, approximately 30 % better recovery of BmimCl during the first rinsing stage was achieved compared to rinsing at 25 °C. When the BmimCl recovery for cellulose samples which were dissolved to different degrees was compared, it was found that a high degree of dissolution leads to slower recovery. Although the recovery was slower for the cellulose samples that were highly dissolved, the total recovery after four rinsing stages was 97. 6 % (+/- 2. 7 %) independent of the degree of dissolution. The concentration profiles for the duration of each rinsing stage was determined. The concentration profile of the first rinsing stage showed that more than 65 % of the BmimCl used could be recovered in 10 min when only 2. 4 ml rinsing water per gram of BmimCl was used. For the 0. 16 mm thick starting material films used in this study, four rinsing stages of 10 min duration each, using rinsing water at 80 °C was found to be sufficient for BmimCl recovery, independent of the dissolution conditions. Partial dissolution was achieved for few of the dissolution conditions investigated. Complete dissolution occurred for the majority of dissolution conditions and the produced films did not qualify as ACCs. Some of the dissolution conditions resulted not only in complete dissolution of the cellulose, but also in possible degradation and weakening of the cellulose. Especially when high concentrations of BmimCl was used, the regenerated cellulose structure had more defects and was weakened. It is recommended that shorter dissolution times and lower BmimCl concentrations be investigated. For the samples that did show some remnants of the native cellulose fibres, the undissolved fractions did not have a reinforcing effect on the regenerated cellulose matrix. For this reason, dissolving wood pulp was not suitable for the production of ACCs by partial dissolution. It is recommended that the starting material sheets be prepared as a mixture of the dissolving wood pulp and a different, stronger, high purity cellulose source, such as cotton. If the starting material contains stronger cellulose fibres, partial dissolution might result in the desired strengthening effect. Most of the sheets showed a large amount of variation which was suspected to be due to uneven dispersion and removal of the BmimCl through the film, the defects discussed or internal stresses resulting from the drying process. It is recommended that the process be refined to eliminate the large variation observed within each sample. The presence of BmimCl was found to have a plasticising effect on the produced cellulose film. The BmimCl inhibited the formation of crystals, probably resulting in the plasticising effect. It was also determined that crystals did not form as soon as <b>cellulose</b> <b>precipitated</b> from solution, due to the presence of BmimCl. Only after BmimCl was removed from the cellulose structure did crystals form in the solid cellulose structure. The crystal formation in the solid phase continued as the cellulose films were allowed to age. The long term effect of BmimCl was to reduce this crystal formation in the regenerated phase over time, but an increase in crystallinity was still observed independent of the presence of BmimCl in the cellulose. The temperature at which regeneration of the cellulose and rinsing of the regenerated material was performed visually affected the produced material. Regeneration and rinsing at 25 °C resulted in more transparent films with reduced crystallinity when compared to the films that were regenerated and rinsed at 80 °C. The films were more plastic due to the reduced crystallinity resulting from the lower temperature.
