5|$|About 90% of beetle species enter {{a period}} of adult diapause, a quiet phase with reduced {{metabolism}} to tide unfavourable environmental conditions. Adult diapause {{is the most common}} form of diapause in Coleoptera. To endure the period without food (often lasting many months) adults prepare by accumulating reserves of lipids, glycogen, proteins and other substances needed for resistance to future hazardous changes of environmental conditions. This diapause is induced by signals heralding the arrival of the unfavourable season; usually the cue is <b>photoperiodic.</b> Short (decreasing) day length serves as a signal of approaching winter and induces winter diapause (hibernation). A study of hibernation in the Arctic beetle Pterostichus brevicorni showed that the body fat levels of adults were highest in autumn with the alimentary canal filled with food, but empty by the end of January. This loss of body fat was a gradual process, occurring in combination with dehydration.|$|E
2500|$|Sea turtle {{hatchlings}} {{emerging from}} nests on beaches are another casualty of light pollution. It {{is a common}} misconception that hatchling sea turtles are attracted to the moon. Rather, they find the ocean by {{moving away from the}} dark silhouette of dunes and their vegetation, a behavior with which artificial lights interfere. The breeding activity and reproductive phenology of toads, however, are cued by moonlight. Juvenile seabirds may also be disoriented by lights as they leave their nests and fly out to sea. Amphibians and reptiles are also affected by light pollution. Introduced light sources during normally dark periods can disrupt levels of melatonin production. Melatonin is a hormone that regulates <b>photoperiodic</b> physiology and behaviour. Some species of frogs and salamanders utilize a light-dependent [...] "compass" [...] to orient their migratory behaviour to breeding sites. Introduced light can also cause developmental irregularities, such as retinal damage, reduced sperm production, and genetic mutation.|$|E
2500|$|Many animals use the {{variation}} in duration of melatonin production each day as a seasonal clock. In animals including humans, the profile of melatonin synthesis and secretion {{is affected by the}} variable duration of night in summer as compared to winter. The change in duration of secretion thus serves as a biological signal for the organization of daylength-dependent (<b>photoperiodic)</b> seasonal functions such as reproduction, behavior, coat growth, and camouflage coloring in seasonal animals. In seasonal breeders that do not have long gestation periods and that mate during longer daylight hours, the melatonin signal controls the seasonal variation in their sexual physiology, and similar physiological effects can be induced by exogenous melatonin in animals including mynah birds and hamsters. Melatonin can suppress libido by inhibiting secretion of luteinizing hormone [...] and follicle-stimulating hormone [...] from the anterior pituitary gland, especially in mammals that have a breeding season when daylight hours are long. The reproduction of long-day breeders is repressed by melatonin and the reproduction of short-day breeders is stimulated by melatonin.|$|E

50|$|The cyc gene {{found in}} the moth Sesamia nonagrioides, or {{commonly}} known as the Mediterranean corn borer, has been cloned in a recent study; this SnCYC was found to have 667 amino acids. Further structural analysis showed that it also contains a BCTR domain in its C-terminal in addition to the common domains found in Drosophila CYC. Researchers found that the mRNAs of Sncyc expression was rhythmic in long day (16L:8D), constant darkness, and short day (10L:14D) cycles after investigating its expression patterns in larvae brains. Furthermore, it was found that <b>photoperiodic</b> conditions affect the expression patterns and/or amplitudes of this gene. In Sesamia nonagrioides, this Sncyc gene is associated with diapause. This {{is due to the fact}} that under short day (diapause conditions) the <b>photoperiodic</b> signal alters the accumulation of mRNA. However in Drosophila, this gene does not oscillate or change in expression patterns in response to photoperiod, therefore suggesting that this species may be useful in further studying the molecular control of circadian and photoperiodic clocks in insects.|$|E

50|$|Many mammals {{synchronize}} their pregnancies {{to ensure}} a greater infant survival rate, but not the Zalophus wollebaeki. The Zalophus wollebaeki is different from most mammals since they do not synchronize, {{which can be a}} major reason why they are becoming extinct. Higher infant mortality rate is the effect caused by the lack of synchrony between the mother sea lions. Plausible reasons for this low synchrony could be the absence of strong <b>photoperiodic</b> change throughout the year, which is thought to regulate embryonic diapause, or adaptation to an environment with variable productivity and prey availability, or both.|$|E
5000|$|Some plants rely {{on light}} signals to {{determine}} when to switch from the vegetative to the flowering stage of plant development. This type of photomorphogenesis is known as photoperiodism and involves using red photoreceptors (phytochromes) to determine the daylength. As a result, <b>photoperiodic</b> plants only start making flowers when the days have reached a [...] "critical daylength," [...] allowing these plants to initiate their flowering period according {{to the time of}} year. For example, [...] "long day" [...] plants need long days to start flowering, and [...] "short day" [...] plants need to experience short days before they will start making flowers.|$|E
5000|$|L. dispar larvae {{have three}} {{characteristic}} stages: pre-diapause in the autumn, winter diapause and post-diapause in the spring. Heavy mortality is common between oviposition (when females lay their eggs) {{in the late}} summer and the resumption of larval feeding in late spring: larvae begin feeding again in early may. In order to enter diapause, L. dispar uses temperature and <b>photoperiodic</b> indicators to determine when to start the overwinter process: entering diapause at low temperatures (<15°C) [...] As well temperature, environmental and endogenous factors also determine when larvae terminate diapause: generally when ambient temperature is high (>25°C).|$|E
5000|$|However, C. ruderalis early, plant-age {{triggered}} [...] "autoflowering" [...] characteristic (which {{offers some}} agricultural advantages over the <b>photoperiodic</b> flowering varieties) {{as well as}} its reputed resistance to insect and disease pressures makes it attractive to plant breeders. [...] C. indica strains are frequently cross-bred with C. ruderalis to produce autoflowering plants with high THC content, improved hardiness and reduced height. One strain, identified in 1960, is Cannabis x intersita Sojak which is a cross between C. sativa and C. ruderalis. Attempts to produce a Cannabis strain with a shorter growing season are another application of cultivating C. ruderalis. C. ruderalis when crossed with sativa and indica strains produces a plant which flowers automatically and is fully mature in 10 weeks.|$|E
5000|$|In 1920, W. W. Garner and H. A. Allard {{published}} their discoveries on photoperiodism {{and felt}} it was the length of daylight that was critical, but it was later discovered that {{the length of the}} night was the controlling factor. <b>Photoperiodic</b> flowering plants are classified as long-day plants or short-day plants even though night is the critical factor because of the initial misunderstanding about daylight being the controlling factor. Along with long-day plants and short-day plants, there are plants that fall into a [...] "dual-day length category". These plants are either long-short-day plants (LSDP) or short-long-day plants (SLDP). LSDPs flower after a series of long days followed by short days whereas SLDPs flower after a series of short days followed by long days. [...] Each plant has a different length critical photoperiod, or critical night length.|$|E

50|$|The journal {{was founded}} as the {{official}} publication of the Society for Research on Biological Rhythms. It released its first issue in March 1986, under first editor-in-chief Ben Rusak, who served from 1986 to 1994. The original Associate Editors were Gene Block, Serge Daan, Jerry Feldman, Bruce Goldman, Mike Menaker, Bob Moore, and Terry Page. The first issue largely focused on zoology and physiology, {{but over the years}} the field of discussion has expanded to include neurobiology, cell and molecular biology, photobiology, computational biology, behavioral ecology, and translational medicine. Early experiments focused on Syrian and Siberian hamsters, ground squirrels, and bubble snails. Since those first publications, experimental subjects represented in the journal have grown to be more diverse, as well as the techniques used to research them. The techniques mentioned in the first few publications involved behavioral and physiological monitoring, circumscribed brain lesions, melatonin radioimmunoassays, electroretinography, and electrophysiological recordings. Early research topics included “splitting,” circannual rhythmicity, <b>photoperiodic</b> time measurement, and circadian pacemaker development, coupling, and output.|$|E
50|$|The later part of Pittendrigh's {{research}} {{is devoted to}} studying the temperature dependence of <b>photoperiodic</b> responses in drosophila. This work was crucial in developing the Photo-Periodic Response Curve (PPRC), a phase-response-curve that factors in seasonal daylength changes when describing entrainment. He proposed another dual oscillator model, in which the master oscillator is light sensitive, and the slave oscillator is temperature sensitive. This model explains his observations of seeing significant entrainment responses to varying photostimulation and seeing dampened, yet still significant, responses to changing temperatures. Pittendrigh also collaborated with Knopka {{on the study of}} drosophila per mutants (which genetically have longer or shorter intrinsic periods due to mutation in the per gene) and their different entrainment responses to temperature and light stimuli. The per mutants have impaired temperature dependence, which suggests that the activity of the temperature oscillator in the mutants are reduced as compared to wildtype. This is another evidence that support the temperature-light dual model system.|$|E

5000|$|Though not all freeze-avoidant insects produce polyols, all hibernating insects produce thermal {{hysteresis}} factors (THFs). For example, the haemolymph of the {{mealworm beetle}} Tenebrio molitor contains {{a family of}} such proteins. A seasonal <b>photoperiodic</b> timing mechanism is responsible for increasing the antifreeze protein levels with concentrations reaching their highest in the winter. In the pyrochroid beetle, Dendroides canadensis, a short photoperiod of 8 hours light and 16 hours of darkness, results in {{the highest levels of}} THFs, which corresponds with the shortening of daylight hours associated with winter. These antifreeze proteins are thought to stabilize SCPs by binding directly to the surface structures of the ice crystals themselves, diminishing crystal size and growth. [...] Therefore, instead of acting to change the biochemistry of the bodily fluids as seen with cryoprotectants, THFs act directly with the ice crystals by adsorbing to the developing crystals to inhibit their growth and reduce the chance of lethal freezing occurring.|$|E

He demonstrated that plants open and close their leaves and insects eclose according to circadian rhythms, even in continuous light or darkness. [...] His crossing experiments with bean plants of different periods in 1935 demonstrated that the next generation had periods of intermediate durations, supporting the suggestion that circadian rhythms are heritable. [...] Bünning also demonstrated that an artificial photoperiod can induce flowering at inappropriate times, supporting his model of endogenous oscillators entrained to external stimuli. To create artificial photoperiods, Bünning exposed plants to a light-dark cycle indicative of a specific season, such as the long days and short nights of summer. By entraining the plants to a spring or summer photoperiod, Bünning was able to induce flowering, even if the actual season were fall or winter. [...] From his results, Bünning {{proposed that}} biological clocks have sensors for both light and dark, and their relationship aids <b>photoperiodic</b> timekeeping.|$|E

50|$|Another set of {{flowering}} controls stems from photoperiodism which initiates flowering {{based on the}} length of nighttime. Long day plants flower with a short night, while short day plants require uninterrupted darkness. Some plants are restricted to either condition, while others can operate under a combination of the two, and some plants do not operate under photoperiodism. In Arabidopsis, the gene CONSTANS responds to long day conditions and enables flowering when it stops repressing flowering locus t (Shim et al. 2015). In rice, <b>photoperiodic</b> response is slightly more complex and is controlled by the florigen genes Rice Flowering locus T 1 (RFT1) and Heading date 3 a (Hd3a). Hd3a, is a homolog {{of flowering}} locus t and, when no longer repressed, activates flowering by directing modification of DNA at the shoot apical meristem with florigen. Heading date 1 (Hd1) is a gene that promotes flowering under short day conditions but represses flowering under long day as it either activates or suppresses Hd3a. Meanwhile, RFT1 can cause flowering under non-inductive long day. Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 can lead to silencing of the genes through histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation. A variety of chromatin modifications operating in both long and short days or only under one condition can also affect the two florigen genes in rice (Sun et al. 2014).|$|E
50|$|Wing {{polymorphism}} {{is common}} in the Gerridae despite most univoltine populations being completely apterous (wingless) or macropterous (with wings). Apterous populations of gerrids would be restricted to stable aquatic habitats that experience little change in environment, while macropterous populations can inhabit more changing, variable water supplies. Stable waters are usually large lakes and rivers, while unstable waters are generally small and seasonal. Gerrids produce winged forms for dispersal purposes and macropterous individuals are maintained due {{to their ability to}} survive in changing conditions. Wings are necessary if the body of water is likely to dry since the gerrid must fly to a new source of water. However, wingless forms are favored due to competition for ovarian development and wings and reproductive success is the main goal due to the selfish gene theory. Overwintering gerrids usually are macropterous, or with wings, so they can fly back to their aquatic habitat after winter. An environmental switch mechanism controls seasonal dimorphism observed in bivoltine species, or species having two broods per year. This switch mechanism is what helps determine whether or not a brood with wings will evolve. Temperature also {{plays an important role in}} <b>photoperiodic</b> switch. Temperatures signify the seasons and thus when wings are needed since they hibernate during winter. Ultimately, these switching mechanisms alter genetic alleles for wing characteristics, helping to maintain biological dispersal.|$|E
