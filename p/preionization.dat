At 300 K, the <b>preionization</b> left by successive discharges at the end of interpulses mainly consists of positive and negative ions with a density of about 10 ^ 9 cm− 3 for a repetition frequency of 10 kHz. When photoionization is taken into account with a level of seed charges of about 10 ^ 9 cm− 3, the dynamics and the characteristics of the discharge during a voltage pulse are shown to depend only weakly on the nature of negative seed charges (electrons or ions).
