25|$|The {{identity}} relation = on any set {{is also a}} <b>partial</b> <b>order</b> {{in which}} every two distinct elements are incomparable. It is also the only relation that is both a <b>partial</b> <b>order</b> and an equivalence relation. Many advanced properties of posets are interesting mainly for non-linear orders.|$|E

25|$|The trees {{within a}} graph may be {{partially}} ordered by their subgraph relation, and any infinite chain in this <b>partial</b> <b>order</b> has an upper bound (the {{union of the}} trees in the chain). Zorn's lemma, one of many equivalent statements to the axiom of choice, requires that a <b>partial</b> <b>order</b> in which all chains are upper bounded have a maximal element; in the <b>partial</b> <b>order</b> on the trees of the graph, this maximal element must be a spanning tree. Therefore, if Zorn's lemma is assumed, every infinite connected graph has a spanning tree.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} {{the problem of}} searching for a given element in a partially ordered set.

25|$|Low-dimensional {{comparability}} graphs: The comparability graph for {{a partially}} ordered set has a vertex for each set element and an edge between two set elements that are related by the <b>partial</b> <b>order.</b> The order dimension of a <b>partial</b> <b>order</b> is the minimum number of linear orders whose intersection is the given <b>partial</b> <b>order.</b> If a <b>partial</b> <b>order</b> has bounded order dimension, then an adjacency labeling scheme for the vertices in its comparability graph may be defined by labeling each vertex with its position {{in each of the}} defining linear orders, and determining that two vertices are adjacent if each corresponding pair of numbers in their labels has the same order relation as each other pair. In particular, this allows for an adjacency labeling scheme for the chordal comparability graphs, which come from partial orders of dimension at most four.|$|E

40|$|Markov chains {{having the}} same {{stationary}} distribution can be partially ordered by performance in the central limit theorem. We say that one chain {{is at least as}} good as another in the e ciency <b>partial</b> <b>ordering</b> if the variance in the central limit theorem is at least as small for every L 2 () functional of the chain. Peskun <b>partial</b> <b>ordering</b> implies e ciency <b>partial</b> <b>ordering</b> [25, 30]. Here we show that Peskun <b>partial</b> <b>ordering</b> implies, for nite state spaces, ordering of all the eigenvalues of the transition matrices, and, for general state spaces, ordering of the suprema of the spectra of the transition operators. We also de ne a covariance <b>partial</b> <b>ordering</b> based on lag one autocovariances and show that it is equivalent to the e ciency <b>partial</b> <b>ordering</b> when restricted to reversible Markov chains.

25|$|The order {{complex of}} a {{partially}} ordered set consists of the chains (totally ordered subsets) of the <b>partial</b> <b>order.</b> If every pair of some subset is itself ordered, then the whole subset is a chain, so the order complex satisfies the no-Δ condition. It may be interpreted as the clique complex of the comparability graph of the <b>partial</b> <b>order.</b>|$|E

25|$|A {{comparability}} graph is an {{undirected graph}} formed from a <b>partial</b> <b>order</b> {{by creating a}} vertex per element of the order, and an edge connecting any two comparable elements. Thus, a clique in a comparability graph corresponds to a chain, and an independent set in a comparability graph corresponds to an antichain. Any induced subgraph of a comparability graph is itself a comparability graph, formed from the restriction of the <b>partial</b> <b>order</b> to a subset of its elements.|$|E
50|$|A {{class of}} orderings {{somewhat}} more general than series-parallel <b>partial</b> <b>orders</b> {{is provided by}} PQ trees, data structures that have been applied in algorithms for testing whether a graph is planar and recognizing interval graphs. A P node of a PQ tree allows all possible orderings of its children, like a parallel composition of <b>partial</b> <b>orders,</b> while a Q node requires the children to occur in a fixed linear ordering, like a series composition of <b>partial</b> <b>orders.</b> However, unlike series-parallel <b>partial</b> <b>orders,</b> PQ trees allow the linear ordering of any Q node to be reversed.|$|R
50|$|Among all <b>partial</b> <b>orders</b> with a fixed {{number of}} {{elements}} and a fixed number of comparable pairs, the <b>partial</b> <b>orders</b> {{that have the}} largest number of linear extensions are semiorders.|$|R
50|$|Series-parallel <b>partial</b> <b>orders</b> {{have also}} been called multitrees; however, that name is ambiguous: multitrees also refer to <b>partial</b> <b>orders</b> with no four-element diamond {{suborder}} and to other structures formed from multiple trees.|$|R
25|$|The prime powers 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 {{appearing}} as elements in these sets may themselves be partially ordered by divisibility; in this smaller <b>partial</b> <b>order,</b> 2 ≤ 4 ≤ 8 {{and there are}} no order relations between other pairs. The 16 sets that are associated with divisors of 120 are the lower sets of this smaller <b>partial</b> <b>order,</b> subsets of elements such that if x ≤ y and y belongs to the subset, then x must also belong to the subset. From any lower set L, one can recover the associated divisor by computing the least common multiple of the prime powers in L. Thus, the <b>partial</b> <b>order</b> on the five prime powers 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 carries enough information to recover the entire original 16-element divisibility lattice.|$|E
25|$|One can {{represent}} any <b>partial</b> <b>order</b> {{as a family}} of sets, such that x < y in the <b>partial</b> <b>order</b> whenever the set corresponding to x is {{a subset of the}} set corresponding to y. In this way, comparability graphs can be shown to be equivalent to containment graphs of set families; that is, a graph with a vertex for each set in the family and an edge between two sets whenever one is a subset of the other.|$|E

25|$|An incomparability graph is an {{undirected graph}} that connects pairs of {{elements}} that are not comparable {{to each other in}} a <b>partial</b> <b>order.</b>|$|E
25|$|A closure {{operation}} satisfying this axiom {{is called}} an anti-exchange closure. If S is a closed set in an anti-exchange closure, then the anti-exchange axiom determines a <b>partial</b> <b>order</b> on the elements not belonging to S, where x ≤ y in the <b>partial</b> <b>order</b> when x belongs to τ(S ∪ {y}). If x is a minimal element of this <b>partial</b> <b>order,</b> then S ∪ {x} is closed. That is, {{the family of}} closed sets of an anti-exchange closure has the property that for any set other than the universal set {{there is an element}} x that can be added to it to produce another closed set. This property is complementary to the accessibility property of antimatroids, and the fact that intersections of closed sets are closed is complementary to the property that unions of feasible sets in an antimatroid are feasible. Therefore, the complements of the closed sets of any anti-exchange closure form an antimatroid.|$|E
