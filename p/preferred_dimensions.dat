The paper {{industry}} and, more specifically, Sappi Fine Paper, {{has not been}} achieving the levels of innovation required to meet rapidly-changing market needs, especially when compared to manufacturers like 3 M. The industry is therefore losing value and not achieving optimal returns on investment. The reasons for this lack of innovation are not known. This study aims to investigate these sub-optimal levels of innovation, and to define some of the possible reasons for it. The study begins with an examination of corporate culture {{and its impact on}} innovation. In this regard, a cultural audit was done on a selected group of Sappi employees involved in product development from manufacturing, and sales and marketing. The questionnaire used was aimed at measuring and quantifying innovation and creativity influencers, and both perceived and <b>preferred</b> <b>dimensions</b> of culture were recorded. A gap analysis was then undertaken between the two, and perceptual charts plotted for each of the research groups. The audit revealed that Sappi Fine Paper does, indeed, have a creative culture, but the gap analysis revealed that in certain dimensions there are large gaps between the perceived and preferred profiles. The most critical gap affecting innovation was the one in the “risk profile” dimension. This revealed a tendency for the company to be risk averse, while the expressed preference of staff is that it be more open to risk taking. The literature review also highlights the importance that risk taking plays in innovation. The conclusion drawn is that, in order to achieve improved levels of innovation, Sappi Fine Paper needs to support existing creativity with a greater openness to risk taking resulting in higher levels of innovation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} new 3 D and planar silicon pixel sensors designed for the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Phase- 2 Upgrade at High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). The project is funded by INFN and sensors are produced in collaboration with the FBK foundry. The HL-LHC will operate at an instantaneous luminosity approximately 5 times larger than the original LHC design, significantly increasing the number of concurrent collisions per bunch crossing, the integrated luminosity delivered to the experiments and, as a consequence, the radiation dose that the detectors will have to sustain. In order to cope with these future conditions, upgrades to the detectors are required. This is necessary for the pixel tracker that is the closest to the interaction point and will be replaced. In this paper, the results, from beam tests performed at Fermilab Test Beam Facility, of thin (100 μm and 130 μm thick) n-in-p type sensors, assembled into hybrid single chip modules bump bonded to the PSI 46 dig readout chip, will be presented. A comparison of the performances obtained with planar sensors before and after proton irradiation up to 3 × 10 ^ 15 n_eq/cm^ 2 will be also discussed. The paper will also report the results obtained with the first 3 D pixel sensors 130 μm thick with columnar electrodes for different pixel cell prototypes. The novelty of the 3 D prototypes is their small pixel cell size, ranging form the standard 100 μm × 150 μm, down to 50 μm × 50 μm and 25 μm × 100 μm, which are the <b>preferred</b> <b>dimensions</b> in the high pile-up environment of the HL-LHC...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe {{organization}} of postthalamic auditory areas remains unclear in many respects. Using a stimulus based on properties of natural sounds, we mapped spectro-temporal receptive fields (STRFs) of neurons {{in the primary}} auditory area field L of unanesthetized zebra finches. Cells were sensitive to only a subset of possible acoustic features: nearly all neurons were narrowly tuned along the spectral dimension, the temporal dimension, or both; broadly tuned and strongly orientation-sensitive cells were rare. At high stimulus intensities, neurons were sensitive to differences in sound energy along their <b>preferred</b> <b>dimension,</b> while at lower intensities, neurons behaved more like simple detectors. Finally, we found a systematic relationship between neurons' STRFs, their electrophysiological properties, and their location in field L input or output layers. These data suggest that spectral and temporal processing are segregated within field L, and provide a unifying account of how field L response properties depend on stimulus intensity...|$|R
40|$|As {{children}} grow older they show an increasing preference for classifying objects {{on the basis}} of shape rather than color. To clarify the nature of this “dimension preference,” children of ages 3 ½ to 6 ½ years were given a method of triads test of dimension preferences, followed (after a week's delay) by a component selection task (see Hale & Morgan, 1973). The most notable results were these: (a) as expected, children below and above the median age differed in frequency of shape preference, (b) for children below the median age, higher component selection test scores were observed for the <b>preferred</b> <b>dimension,</b> although all scores were considerably above chance level and (c) no age difference was found in the relative magnitudes of the component selection scores. The results suggest that a “preference” for a particular dimension does not necessarily indicate a high degree of selective attention to that dimension. Also, the age difference in children's dimension preferences may be attributable to factors unrelated to selective attention...|$|R
40|$|We {{explored}} the mapping between mass-count syntax and semantics, and how verb event semantics affect {{the meaning of}} derived nouns. In Experiment 1, we compared the interpretation of mass and count nouns derived from iterative verbs that describe bounded events (e. g., jump) and nouns derived from non-iterative verbs that describe unbounded events (e. g., dance). Participants based judgments primarily on number for count nouns derived from both kinds of verb, and for mass nouns derived from iterative verbs (e. g., some jumping). In Experiment 2, we elicited dimension ratings that confirmed that number was the <b>preferred</b> <b>dimension</b> of comparison for all count nouns and for mass nouns derived from iterative verbs. We argue that these results provide evidence against the idea that mass nouns force an unindividuated construal (e. g., Bloom, 1994). We also suggest that verb iterativity is importantly linked to individuation by mass and count nouns, and may even access the same underlying ontology of individuals...|$|R

40|$|Data cube {{computation}} {{and representation}} are prohibitively expensive {{in terms of}} time and space. Prior work has focused on either reducing the computation time or condensing the representation of a data cube. In this paper, we introduce Range Cubing as an efficient way to compute and compress the data cube without any loss of precision. A new data structure, range trie, is used to compress and identify correlation in attribute values, and compress the input dataset to effectively reduce the computational cost. The range cubing algorithm generates a compressed cube, called range cube, which partitions all cells into disjoint ranges. Each range represents a subset of cells with the identical aggregation value as a tuple which has the same number of dimensions as the input data tuples. The range cube preserves the roll-up/drill-down semantics of a data cube. Compared to H-Cubing, experiments on real dataset show a running time of less than one thirtieth, still generating a range cube of less than one ninth of the space of the full cube, when both algorithms run in their <b>preferred</b> <b>dimension</b> orders. On synthetic data, range cubing demonstrates much better scalability, as well as higher adaptiveness to both data sparsity and skew...|$|R

Methods: We carried out a questionnaire-based study at the Orthodontics and Pedodontics Clinic Târgu Mureș, between March 2012 and September 2012. The questionnaires consisted of two parts: the first included questions related to the dimension, alloy used in fabrication, section (round or rectangular) and manufacturer of the archwires used by the orthodontists in their orthodontic practice, the second part was concerned with their personal opinion about the physical properties and disadvantages of the archwires. Results: From a total number of 90 distributed questionnaires, 62 were returned. The majority of clinicians are using stainless steel (SS) and nickel-titanium alloy (NiTi) wires in their fixed orthodontic treatments, very few are using beta-titanium (Beta Ti), copper nickel-titanium (Co- NiTi) and esthetic archwires.

40|$|Political {{candidates}} use {{a variety}} of negative campaigning strategies, and these attacks have different degrees of success. To explain this, I first introduce a formal model of campaign strategy to show when candidates will engage in negative campaigning and how it can affect election results. Whether candidates choose negative campaigning depends upon three factors: the voters' preconceptions about political candidates' the voters' <b>preferred</b> <b>dimension,</b> and the candidates' character traits. I show that eliminating negative campaigning has an ambiguous effect on voter welfare. Then, I extend the formal model of campaigning to include situations in which candidates campaign dishonestly. I find that allowing this is strictly inferior for voter welfare. Often this is because whenever lying becomes more probable, all campaigns start to look the same. In order to understand the implications of the formal model, I use multiple empirical testing methods. I use laboratory experiments to test how voter beliefs and voter behavior affect the frequency and content of candidates' negative campaigning. I find support for the above comparative statics hypothesis about when candidates are more likely to negatively campaign. Furthermore, the laboratory results are better explained by a quantal response equilibrium model in which voters are risk averse and are more naive than sophisticated in their Bayesian updating ability. I next consider how negative campaigning translates into votes. From survey responses, I show empirical support for candidate tactics that target specific segments of voters based upon their predilections toward accepting negativity in campaigns. One way candidates attack their rivals is by trying to make voters afraid of them. From a laboratory experiment in which subjects made social judgments about pairs of candidates who ran against each other in real elections, we found that the candidates chosen by subjects as more physically threatening had actually lost 65 % of the real elections. Such correlation could arise from common neural mechanisms engaged when viewers make social judgments about faces, and when voters evaluate candidates. This was shown in two independent fMRI studies in which subjects again made judgments about images of unfamiliar politicians who had run in real elections. We found that for judgments of threat, election loss correlated with activity in the insula and ventral anterior cingulate cortex, structures known to be involved in processing negative emotions. These findings suggest that voters are influenced by negative emotions elicited by a candidate’s mere appearance. Finally, we examine the role of candidate fear in explaining voter choice in presidential elections using ANES data from 1980 - 2004. We find that certain groups of voters are more susceptible to fear appeals. After controlling for the factors commonly thought to affect voter decision-making, we also find further evidence that fear of presidential candidates directly affects vote choice. The results have implications for future research on negative political communication, as they suggest that threatening first impressions can harm a candidate's electoral chances. They also show that candidates who wish to successfully utilize negative campaigning must tailor their campaigns not only to reflect the weaknesses of the opponent but also to insure that their message is salient to the specific group of targeted voters...|$|R

The critical elements absent in the current process are the objective assessment of likelihood as part of the whole risk scenario and a visual representation or acknowledgement of uncertainty. A proposed framework would incorporate selected elements of multiple theories and axiomatic approaches in order to: (1) simultaneously examine multiple objectives of the organization, (2) limit bias and subjectivity during the assessment process by converting subjective risk contributors into quantitative values using tools that measure the attack surface and adversarial effort, (3) present likelihood and impact as real-time objective variables that reflect the state of the organization and are grounded on sound mathematical and scientific principles, (4) aggregate and function organization-wide (strategic, operational, and tactical) with maximum transparency, (5) achieve greater representation of the real scenario and strive to model future scenarios, (6) adapt to the <b>preferred</b> granularity, <b>dimensions,</b> and discovery of the decision maker, and (7) improve the decision maker’s ability to select the most optimal alternative by reducing the decision to rational logic.
