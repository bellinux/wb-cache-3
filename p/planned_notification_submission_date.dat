40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of the April {{allowance}} submissions mandate under the European Union emission trading scheme (EU ETS) in carbon emission markets. Using intraday order flow data, we test for the cross-market efficiency of spot-futures dynamics and find that the equilibrium level, adjustment speed and no-arbitrage boundaries of the spot and futures relationship shift subsequent to the <b>submission</b> <b>date.</b> In addition, our results show that the allowance submissions affect the price discovery process, with the carbon spot market providing stronger price leadership in the periods before the <b>submission</b> <b>date</b> and the futures market playing the predominant informational role thereafter. Using the heterogeneous autoregressive realized volatility (HAR-RV) model, we also find a change in volatility spillovers before the <b>submission</b> <b>date,</b> particularly from the spot to the futures market.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse the {{horizontal}} {{merger of companies}} in an already concentrated industry. The participants in mergers are obliged to submit notification to the Competition Commission {{but they also have}} the option of rejecting the merger. At the time of the <b>notification</b> <b>submission</b> the participants do not know whether the Commission is strong or weak, and they can complain to the Court if the Commission prohibits the merger. We model the strategic interaction between Participants and Commission in a dynamic game of incomplete information and determine weak perfect Bayesian equilibria. The main finding of our paper is that Participants will base their decision to submit notification on their belief in a weak Commission decision and will almost completely ignore the possibility of a strong Commission decision. We also provide a detailed examination of one case from Serbian regulatory practice, which coincides with the results of our game theoretical model...|$|R
