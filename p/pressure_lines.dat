25|$|Natural gas and propane supply pipes to {{structures}} often prove especially dangerous {{during and}} after earthquakes. Should a building move from its foundation or fall due to cripple wall collapse, the ductile iron pipes transporting the gas within the structure may be broken, typically {{at the location of}} threaded joints. The gas may then still be provided to the pressure regulator from higher <b>pressure</b> <b>lines</b> and so continue to flow in substantial quantities; it may then be ignited by a nearby source such as a lit pilot light or arcing electrical connection.|$|E
2500|$|Natural gas is {{typically}} produced {{in association with}} oil from wells. [...] Wells can also be drilled into geological formations that have mostly gas and very little oil. [...] In the infancy of the oil industry, any natural gas produced from oil wells was burned off. Later, states passed [...] conservation laws which required the gas to be captured and transported in pipelines for useful purposes. [...] In order to prevent any gaps in the natural gas regulation when natural gas flows in interstate commerce, Congress enacted the Natural Gas Act of 1938. [...] That law required that companies must obtain from the Federal Power Commission (FPC) a [...] "certificate of public convenience and necessity" [...] (certificate) before making any sale for resale natural gas in interstate commerce. The FPC set the maximum prices charged for gas sold under a certificate. For example, if gas flowed from a well in Texas through a pipeline to New York where it was sold to a gas distribution company, the sale by the pipeline to the distributor would need a certificate. [...] The final sale to retail customers were exempt from the law. [...] Although the Natural Gas Act regulated both the transportation and sale of gas in interstate commerce, the [...] "production and gathering" [...] of gas was exempt from federal regulation, although potentially subject to state control. [...] Production means bringing the gas {{out of the ground}} to a pipe {{at the top of the}} wellhead. [...] Gathering refers to the flow of gas through low <b>pressure</b> <b>lines</b> to the center of a gas field where the gas is treated and compressed to bring it up to the high pressures used in long-distance pipelines.|$|E

30|$|A {{source of}} inert gas is {{dynamically}} regulated in software from > 60 psig {{down to two}} different pressures by two analog pressure regulators (ITV 1030 - 31 N 2 L 4 -Q, SMC Corporation). One <b>pressure</b> <b>line</b> drives the pneumatic actuators (typically set to 60 psig), and the other <b>pressure</b> <b>line</b> drives gas flow for liquid transfers and evaporation (typically 3 to 15 psig). The two lines are distributed to actuators and the gas supplier through solenoid valve banks located in the synthesis module. The higher <b>pressure</b> <b>line</b> is used to raise and lower the reaction vessels using pneumatic cylinders (NCDGBN 20 - 0300, SMC Corporation), turn the stopcock valves via the rotary pneumatic actuators (CRB 2 BW 20 - 180 S, SMC Corporation), raise and lower the two z-axis actuators (MXS 8 - 50, SMC Corporation) for the vial gripper and gas supplier, and open and close the vial gripper (MHS 2 - 16 D, SMC Corporation). The lower <b>pressure</b> <b>line</b> feeds into the gas supplier that seals to the gas inlet gaskets {{on top of the}} cassettes, and an external line {{that can be used to}} transfer [18 F]fluoride from a source vial into the anion exchange cartridge on the cassette, for example.|$|R
40|$|An optimal <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> control {{algorithm}} was proposed for the fuel economy improvement of an AT-based parallel hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). By performing lever analysis at each gear step, the required <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> was obtained considering the torque ratio of the friction elements. In addition, the required <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> of the mode clutch was calculated. Based on these results, the optimal <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> map at each gear step of the EV and HEV modes was presented. Using the <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> map, an optimal <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> was performed for the AT input torque and mode. To investigate the proposed <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> {{control algorithm}}, a HEV performance simulator was developed based on the powertrain model of the target HEV, and fuel economy improvement was evaluated. Simulation results showed that as the gear step became higher, the optimal <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> control could reduce the hydraulic power loss, which gave a 2. 2 % fuel economy improvement compared to the existing <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> control for the FTP- 72 mode...|$|R

50|$|In one {{hydraulic}} control variant the valve is opened passively by {{the thrust of}} the medium. In this case the discharge valve has a non-return function which prevents flowback from the <b>pressure</b> <b>line.</b> At the same time the high-densitiy solids are precompacted to close to the <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> before the discharge valve opens. This means that pipe knocking resulting from pressure pulsations can be avoided.|$|R
5000|$|On April 17, 2005, the Millstone Nuclear Power Plant in Connecticut {{was shut}} down due to a [...] "false alarm" [...] that {{indicated}} an unsafe pressure drop in the reactor's steam system when the steam pressure was actually nominal.

50|$|In use, an {{inflatable}} jacket (sleeve, glove or boot) encloses the limb requiring treatment, and <b>pressure</b> <b>lines</b> are connected between the jacket {{and the air}} pump. When activated, the pump fills the air chambers of the jacket in order to pressurize the tissues in the limb, thereby forcing fluids, such as blood and lymph, out of the pressurized area. A short time later, the pressure is reduced, allowing increased blood flow back into the limb.|$|E
5000|$|Hydraulic {{drive systems}} could lower the windows at rest, since {{pressure}} from the hydraulic system was merely released to lower the window. Raising the windows required an electrically operated pump to operate and introduce pressure at the appropriate cylinder. These systems also required <b>pressure</b> <b>lines</b> to each cylinder (in the doors, {{as well as on}} certain cars, to the power seat and a power operated convertible top). Because of the complexity, the system could also leak fluid.|$|E

40|$|As {{alternative}} to geared and direct drive solutions, fluid power drive trains {{are being developed}} by several institutions around the world. The common configuration is where the wind turbine rotor is coupled to a hydraulic pump. The pump is connected through a high <b>pressure</b> <b>line</b> to a hydraulic motor and (synchronous) generator. However, in the concept presented here the high <b>pressure</b> <b>line</b> connects the pump to a nozzle. The nozzle converts the high pressure/low speed flow into low pressure/high speed jet, i. e. hydrostatic to hydrodynamic power.

50|$|Recharging the {{high-pressure}} tanks {{was accomplished}} by the Space Shuttle fleet until its retirement. When an orbiter was docked to the station's Pressurized Mating Adapters (PMA-2 or PMA-3), oxygen was routed through <b>pressure</b> <b>lines</b> from the PMAs to the Quest Airlock. The pumping of the oxygen from the docked spacecraft tanks into Quests high-pressure tank {{was accomplished by}} the Oxygen Recharge Compressor Assembly (ORCA).After the retirement of the Space Shuttle fleet, the Nitrogen Oxygen Recharge System (NORS) and spacecraft from the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program will take over this task.|$|E
50|$|The Learjet 25 utilize {{wheel brakes}} {{as the primary}} method for {{reducing}} speed after landing. The brake system utilizes hydraulic pressure for power boost. The brake valves are controlled via the rudder pedal toe brakes through mechanical linkages. Two shuttle valves in the <b>pressure</b> <b>lines</b> prevent fluid feedback between the pilot's and copilot's pedals. Four additional shuttle valves connect the pneumatic system to the brake system for emergency braking. An integral anti-skid system in installed to affect maximum braking efficiency. In order to minimize heat build-up in the brakes and reduce brake wear, pilots are advised to deploy the spoilers upon touchdown.|$|E
50|$|Instead, the {{plumbing}} {{at various levels}} of the building are often sequestered, with pressure supplied from a rooftop water tower instead of the municipal supply.

5000|$|The {{inclined}} lift, or inclined elevator—occasionally inclinator—is not a funicular, {{since it}} has only one car carrying payload on the slope. The car is either winched up to the station {{on the top of}} the incline where the cable is collected on a winch drum, or the single car is balanced by a counterweight and operated the same way as a funicular with two cars. Many inclined lifts were constructed along the <b>pressure</b> <b>lines</b> of storage power plants for transporting building materials. Examples are the Gelmerbahn leading to the Gelmersee and the Funicolare Piora-Ritom leading to Lago Ritom, both in Switzerland.|$|E
50|$|Increasing {{the design}} overall {{pressure}} {{ratio of the}} compression system raises the combustor entry temperature. Therefore, at a fixed fuel flow and airflow, there {{is an increase in}} turbine inlet temperature. Although the higher temperature rise across the compression system implies a larger temperature drop over the turbine system, the nozzle temperature is unaffected, because the same amount of heat is being added to the total system. There is, however, a rise in nozzle pressure, because turbine expansion ratio increases more slowly than the overall pressure ratio (which is inferred by the divergence of the constant <b>pressure</b> <b>lines</b> on the TS diagram). Consequently, net thrust increases, implying a specific fuel consumption (fuel flow/net thrust) decrease.|$|E
50|$|The {{anesthetic}} {{machine is}} used to blend breathing gas for patients under anesthesia during surgery. The gas mixing and delivery system lets the anesthetist control oxygen fraction, nitrous oxide concentration and the concentration of volatile anesthetic agents.The machine is usually supplied with oxygen (O2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from low <b>pressure</b> <b>lines</b> and high pressure reserve cylinders, and the metered gas is mixed at ambient pressure, after which additional anesthetic agents may be added by a vaporizer, and the gas may be humidified. Air {{is used as a}} diluent to decrease oxygen concentration. In special cases other gases may also be added to the mixture. These may include carbon dioxide (CO2), used to stimulate respiration, and helium (He) to reduce resistance to flow or to enhance heat transfer.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Line</b> of action, <b>pressure</b> <b>line</b> : Line {{along which}} the force between two meshing gear teeth is directed. It {{has the same}} {{direction}} as the force vector. In general, the line of action changes from moment to moment during the period of engagement of a pair of teeth. For involute gears, however, the tooth-to-tooth force is always directed along the same line—that is, the line of action is constant. This implies that for involute gears the path of contact is also a straight line, coincident with the line of action—as is indeed the case.|$|R
