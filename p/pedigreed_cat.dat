The male progenitor of a cat, especially a <b>pedigreed</b> <b>cat,</b> is its sire, and its female progenitor is its dam. In Early Modern English, the word kitten was interchangeable with the now obsolete word catling.|$|E

Turkish random-bred cats were grouped with Israeli random-bred cats while the Turkish Van was grouped with Egyptian random-bred cats.However, the UC Davis only studied American cat fancy registered Angoras rather than the “true” Turkish Angora or Ankara Kedisi directly from Turkey, and especially from the Ankara Zoo.|$|R
50|$|A {{show cat}} (also {{known as a}} {{purebred}} cat or <b>pedigreed</b> <b>cat)</b> {{is one that has}} been judged to be close to the physical ideal for its breed standard at a cat show. Not all pedigreed cats are show cats, many are just pets but the ones with the best conformation and personality are often shown in associations such as the CFA and TICA in the US, the GCCF in the UK or the FiFe in the rest of Europe. Uncommonly, a prize-winning pedigreed show cat can be worth thousands of dollars but most are loved pets. In order to compare examples of breeds and improve stock, cat shows are held where judges evaluate the cats according to a breed standard. Pedigreed cats are often identified with microchip implants.|$|E

The breed is accepted by all North American cat registries. Originally {{known as the}} Domestic Shorthair, the breed was renamed in 1906 to the [...] "American Shorthair" [...] to better represent its [...] "all-American" [...] origins and to differentiate it from other shorthaired breeds. The name [...] "American Shorthair" [...] also reinforces {{the fact that the}} breed is a pedigreed breed distinct from the random-bred non-pedigreed domestic short-haired cats in North America, which may nevertheless resemble the ASH. Both the American Shorthair breed and the random-bred cats from which the breed is derived are sometimes called working cats because they were used for controlling rodent populations, on ships and farms.|$|E

5000|$|The Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) is a cat registry, {{established}} in 1910 {{and the largest}} organisation that registers <b>pedigree</b> <b>cats</b> in the United Kingdom. It was formed from {{a small number of}} cat clubs which were registering cats at the time when the modern cat fancy was in its first stages. It is considered to be the original prototype for cat fancy registries. It is an independent body with around 150 member clubs, including specialist breed clubs and area clubs covering particular regions. The GCCF became an incorporated company on 5 November 2010. It licenses cat shows put on by its affiliated clubs with about 135 shows per year. <b>Pedigree</b> <b>cats</b> shown at these shows can gain the titles Champion, Grand Champion, Imperial Grand Champion and Olympian. The latter having three levels, Bronze, Silver and Gold. The word Champion is replaced by Premier for neutered cats. The showing of non-pedigree cats (often referred to as Domestic shorthair and Domestic longhair) and Pedigree Pets is also popular at GCCF shows.|$|R

In France, the Persian is the only breed whose registration declined between 2003 and 2007, dropping by more than a quarter.|$|R
40|$|Recent reports {{identified}} Tritrichomonas fetus, the causative {{agent of}} bovine trichomonosis, in cats with large-bowel diarrhea in the US. Between July 2007 and August 2008, {{a total of}} 105 Swiss cats were tested for T. fetus with the InPouchTM culture system and/or PCR, whereof 27 (26 %) yielded positive results. All positive <b>cats</b> were <b>pedigree</b> <b>cats,</b> whereof 22 (81 %) were less than 1 year of age (median 5 months). 25 (93 %) of these cats lived in multi-cat households, and all but one were kept indoor. The clinical picture was dominated by large bowel diarrhea with increased frequency of defecation and fresh blood and mucus. Furthermore, inflamed anus and fecal incontinence was common. 52 % of the T. fetus-positive cats were tested positive for Giardia before, but the treatment with fenbendazole or metronidazole only temporarily alleviated the clinical signs. The treatment with 30 mg/kg of ronidazole q 12 h p. o. was successful in all but 1 cat with only minor transient adverse effects in 3 cats. In conclusion, T. fetus has to be considered an important causative agent of large bowel diarrhea in cats in Switzerland, especially in young indoor <b>pedigree</b> <b>cats...</b>|$|R
40|$|Cattery-housed <b>pedigree</b> <b>cats,</b> located mostly {{within the}} USA, {{have the highest}} {{reported}} prevalence of Tritrichomonas foetus (T foetus) to date. This prospective, multi-institutional, cross sectional study examines the occurrence of T foetus and other enteric parasites in cattery-housed and shelter cats within Australia, where T foetus has only recently been identified. Faecal specimens were collected from 134 cats, including 82 cattery-housed <b>pedigree</b> <b>cats</b> and 52 shelter cats. Faecal examinations performed for most cats included concentration techniques, Snap Giardia test, culture in InPouch medium, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of T foetus ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) genes using species-specific primers. Observed occurrence of T foetus, Giardia species, Isospora species and Toxascaris leonina for cattery-housed cats (and catteries) were 0 %, 7. 4 (13. 8) %, 10. 9 (22. 6) % and 1. 6 (3. 2) %, respectively. Observed occurrence of T foetus, Giardia species, Isospora species and hookworms for shelter cats were 0 %, 11. 5 %, 9. 8 % and 4. 9 %, respectively. These results suggest the prevalence of T foetus in cattery-housed cats is currently much lower in Australia than in the USA, while Isospora and Giardia species infections are common...|$|R
5000|$|A common {{conception}} is {{that all}} <b>pedigreed</b> <b>cats</b> are less healthy than random-bred cats due to inbreeding. The Ascent of Cat Breeds: Genetic Evaluations of Breeds and Worldwide Random-bred Populations by Lipinski et al. showed that <b>pedigreed</b> <b>cats</b> are more inbred than random bred cats. For some breeds such as Singapura and Burmese the genetic diversity is very low and should be addressed. Some breeders take great care to select for the healthiest animals, and this {{has the potential to}} reduce the incidence of health issues. An example of this is blindness in the Abyssinian caused by PRA, which have been reduced from 45% to less than 4% in 2008. [...] Many of the worst, like PKD in Persians, Hip Dysplacia in British Shorthairs and Maine Coons, HCM in Maine Coons, Persians, Exotic Shorthair, British Shorthair, Norwegian Forest Cat, Ragdoll and Bengal, are still present in high frequencies. The frequency of HCM in British Shorthairs are 2.1% for females and 20.4% for males. The frequency of Hip Dysplacia in Maine Coons is 36,3% [...] or 30.2%. Some breeders use preventive screening, but no studies documenting possible reductions in prevalences exists.|$|R
