In this report an approach for rendering <b>hatched</b> <b>line</b> drawings for polygonal meshes is presented. The proposed method allows the generation of <b>hatching</b> <b>lines</b> for interactive on-screen display {{as well as for}} vector-based printer output. We use local curvature information to compute streamlines {{on the surface of the}} model. A new algorithm ensures here an even distribution of the streamlines such that the visual quality of the final rendition is enhanced.

To achieve interactive frame-rates the shading of the <b>hatching</b> <b>lines</b> is calculated at run-time using a virtual machine. For printer output a vector oriente...|$|R

40|$|<b>Hatching</b> <b>lines</b> {{are often}} used in line {{illustrations}} to convey tone and texture of a surface. In this paper we present methods to generate <b>hatching</b> <b>lines</b> from polygonal meshes and render them in high quality either at interactive rates for on-screen display or for reproduction in print. Our approach is based on local curvature information that is integrated to form streamlines {{on the surface of}} the mesh. We use a new algorithm that provides an even distribution of these lines. A special processing of these streamlines ensures high quality line rendering for both intended output media later on. While the streamlines are generated in a preprocessing stage, <b>hatching</b> <b>lines</b> are rendered either for vector-based printer output or on-screen display, the latter allowing for interaction in terms of changing the view parameters or manipulating the entire line shading model at run-time using a virtual machine...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} texture-based method to hatch {{anatomical}} structures derived from clinical volume datasets. We consider intervention planning, where object and shape recognition {{are supported by}} adding <b>hatching</b> <b>lines</b> to the anatomical model. The major contribution {{of this paper is}} to enhance the curvature-based hatching of anatomical surfaces by incorporating model-based preferential directions of the underlying anatomical structures. For this purpose, we apply our method on vessels and elongated muscles. Additionally, the whole hatching process is performed without time-consuming user interaction for defining stroke direction and surface parameterization. Moreover, our approach fulfills requirements for interactive explorations like frame coherence and real time capability. ...|$|R
