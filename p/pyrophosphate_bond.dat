A 14 bp substrate activated the cleavage of the 71 bp substrate, containing one EcoRII recognition site (trans-activation) by a competitive mechanism: the activator increased substrate binding but not catalysis. The activation increased if the substrate concentration decreased and if the activator had a lower affinity for the enzyme than the substrate.

Overexpression of Dcp 2 p partially suppressed the dcp 1 - 2 decapping defect. Moreover, the Dcp 2 protein was required for the decapping of both normal mRNAs and aberrant transcripts that are degraded by the mRNA surveillance pathway. The Dcp 2 protein contains a MutT motif, which is found in a class of pyrophosphatases. Mutational analyses indicated that the region of Dcp 2 p containing the MutT motif is necessary and sufficient for Dcp 2 p's function in mRNA decapping. The Dcp 2 p also coimmunoprecipitates with the DCP 1 decapping enzyme and is required for the production of enzymatically active decapping enzyme.
