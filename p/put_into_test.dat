40|$|Abstract—Traditionally, {{test cases}} {{are used to}} check whether a system {{conforms}} to its requirements. However, to achieve good quality and coverage, large amounts of test cases are needed, and thus huge efforts have to be <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>test</b> generation and maintenance. We propose a methodology, called Abstract Testing, in which test cases are replaced by verification scenarios. Such verification scenarios are more abstract than test cases, thus fewer of them are needed and they are easier to create and maintain. Checking verification scenarios against the source code is done automatically using a software model checker. In this paper we describe the general idea of Abstract Testing, and demonstrate its feasibility by a case study from the automotive systems domain. I...|$|E

In order to obtain more robust and reliable results, the sensitivity of our efficiency indices were <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>test</b> by choosing three alternative approaches in specifying the mix of inputs and outputs. The empirical results indicate that: (a) no matter which approach and year are taken into consideration, Baroda and FNB (which are both foreign banks) and BSB (which is a publicly owned institution) are consistently among the most efficient institutions and BDC, ABC and NDB are the least efficient ones; (b) the most efficient banks are either small or large institutions {{in terms of their}} asset sizes; (c) due to the small sample size, the evidence of a relationship between the age of institutions and their technical efficiencies remains inconclusive. One can conclude that financial institutions can further enhance efficiency by adopting self-service technologies such as telephone and internet banking which can substantially reduce their service delivery costs.
