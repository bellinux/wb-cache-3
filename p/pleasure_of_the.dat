5|$|The White House {{travel office}} controversy, {{sometimes}} referred to as Travelgate, was the first major ethics controversy of the Clinton administration. It began in May 1993, when seven employees of the White House Travel Office were fired. This action was unusual because although theoretically staff employees serve at the <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> President and could be dismissed without cause, in practice, such employees usually remain in their posts for many years.|$|E

The White House responded to the controversy by claiming that the firings were done in response to financial improprieties that had been revealed by a brief FBI investigation. Critics contended that the firings {{had been done to}} allow friends of the Clintons to take over the travel business and the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted.|$|E
40|$|<b>Pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{mind are}} {{different}} from <b>pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body. There are two types <b>of</b> <b>pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body: tonic <b>pleasures</b> and relief <b>pleasures.</b> <b>Pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body are given by the contact senses and by the distance senses (seeing and hearing). The distance senses provide a special category <b>of</b> <b>pleasure.</b> <b>Pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mind are not emotions; they are collections of emotions distributed over time. Some distributions of emotions over time are particularly pleasurable, such as episodes in which the peak emotion is strong and the final emotion is positive. The idea that all pleasurable stimuli share some general characteristic should be supplanted {{by the idea that}} humans have evolved domain-specific responses of attraction to stimuli. The emotions that characterize <b>pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mind arise when expectations are violated, causing autonomic nervous system arousal and thereby triggering a search for an interpretation. Thus <b>pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mind occur when an individual has a definite set of expectations (usually tacit) and the wherewithal to interpret the violation (usually by placing it in a narrative framework). <b>Pleasures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mind differ in <b>the</b> objects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emotions they comprise.

As members of the Royal Household, the heralds are appointed at the <b>pleasure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sovereign on the recommendation of the Earl Marshal.

5|$|Goebel's and Beckham's {{challenges}} to the election results were received by the General Assembly on January 2.
