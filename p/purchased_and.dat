40|$|This is the {{ground-breaking}} {{new book}} for aspiring <b>purchasing</b> <b>and</b> supply chain leaders and {{anyone with a}} keen interest in this rapidly evolving field. For too long business has focused on short-term cost advantages through low-cost country sourcing with little regard for the longer-term implications of global sustainability. As the first book to fully address the environmental, social and economic challenges of how companies manage <b>purchasing</b> <b>and</b> supply chains, it aims to inspire the development of current <b>and</b> future <b>purchasing</b> <b>and</b> supply chain leaders. In addition to explaining the basic principles and processes of both <b>purchasing</b> <b>and</b> supply chain management, the book evaluates how to develop strategic <b>and</b> sustainable <b>purchasing</b> <b>and</b> supply chain management. A key message is that <b>purchasing</b> <b>and</b> supply chain management needs to focus on value creation rather than cost cutting. This requires the development of completely new <b>purchasing</b> <b>and</b> supply chain models that involve closed-loop supply structures, supply chain transparency and collaboration with new stakeholders in traditional sourcing and supply chain processes. Aimed at students, educators and practitioners the book integrates sustainability into each chapter as a core element of <b>purchasing</b> <b>and</b> supply chain management. Incorporating case studies from industry into each chapter, the book strikes a balance between theoretical frameworks and guidelines for implementation in practice...|$|R

The tentative research perspectives in our research agenda include the following: the management system for global <b>purchasing</b> <b>and</b> {{supply management}}, evolution of <b>purchasing</b> <b>and</b> supply management, <b>purchasing</b> <b>and</b> supply management capabilities in a globally operating firm, and attractivity of the buying firm towards desired suppliers...|$|R

The three departments do not all report to the same senior manager, to prevent unethical practices and lend credibility to the process. These departments can be <b>purchasing,</b> receiving <b>and</b> accounts payable; or engineering, <b>purchasing</b> <b>and</b> accounts payable; or a plant manager, <b>purchasing</b> <b>and</b> accounts payable.
