The data set is approximated by the closest tree with some penalty for the excessive number of nodes, bending and stretching. Then the so-called [...] "metro map" [...] is constructed. The data points are projected into the closest node. For each node the <b>pie</b> <b>diagram</b> {{of the projected}} points is prepared. The area of the pie {{is proportional to the}} number of the projected points. It is clear from the diagram (left) that the absolute majority of the samples of the different Iris species belong to the different nodes. Only a small fraction of Iris-virginica is mixed with Iris-versicolor (the mixed blue-green nodes in the diagram). Therefore, the three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor) are separable by the unsupervising procedures of nonlinear principal component analysis. To discriminate them, it is sufficient just to select the corresponding nodes on the principal tree.|$|E

40|$|Authors of {{technical}} papers have many visual/graphic aids available to them. The most common are: grid graphs, tables, bar charts, flow charts, maps, <b>pie</b> <b>diagrams,</b> and drawings and sketches. Grid graphs {{are used to}} show relationships. Tables allow the reader to make compari-sons of data. The bar chart is another form of the grid graph and {{is used for the}} same purpose. A flow chart gives the reader a visual description of a process. Maps show the location of specific features. <b>Pie</b> <b>diagrams</b> show the proportional breakdown of a topic. Pictures and sketches show the reader exactly what is being talked about in the report. Visual/graphic aids allow the technical writer to condense and present his information in an aesthetically pleasing manner; in addition, these aids serve as psychological white space. Today, many technical papers have become targets of extensive criticism. Readers of these technical papers complain that sentences are too long, paragraphs contain too many facts, and words that most people have never heard before are used (just to name a few). Most of these complaints are true. Most technical information is not intended to be written at a third to sixth grade level; however, you have to sympathize with the college student who finds himself totally lost when he is reading about a technical subject of his interest. So, who is to blame? Obviously, this is a touchy question and one that is also hard to answer.

Nowadays banks have started increasing their business to securities and insurance and other sectors by adding new range of products. Bancassurance, one such concept, has gained recognition in the recent years. The growth of bancassurance depends on how well banks and insurance companies are able to conquer the operational challenges that are frequently thrown at them. Banks aims at a comprehensive Bancassurance Management with Core Banking platform ie; ease of premium payments using Auto Debit Cards, Net Banking, collection agencies etc. The present empirical based {{study was conducted with}} an objective to examine the recent trends of bancussurance and to analyse the marketing and distribution channel of insurance, its impact on insurers, customers and banking sector and also to examine the issues and problems of bancussurance. The study was based on both primary and secondary data. The area of study is confined only to selected banks of Trissur district. The collected data is analyzed and interpreted by applying various statistical tools and techniques. It is presented in the form of tables, <b>pie</b> <b>diagram</b> and bar diagrams. The research findings will be useful for all the three segments including banks, insurers and customers. The paper concludes that there is a bright future for bancassurance in the Indian insurance market...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{experimental work}} {{was carried out}} to find {{the relationship between the}} tensile strength of woven fabrics and the constituent yarns. One thousand and eighty fabric samples were constructed on a projectile weaving machine from 100 % cotton and polyester/cotton yarns having a blend ratio of 52 : 48 with yarn linear densities of 20, 25, 30 and 15, 20, 25 tex respectively. Tensile strength and other quality parameters of fabric samples and constituent yarns were measured as per standard test methods. The obtained values were analyzed to find the effect of yarn material, yarn linear density, â€˜warp and filling countâ€™ and design on the tensile strength of fabric. The selected parameters of yarn and fabric were found to have the significant effect on the tensile strength of fabric. The manufactured samples were divided into four groups according to the yarn material used in warp and weft directions. Multiple linear regression analysis was carried out by using MINITAB software to develop the relationship in both warp and weft directions for each group as well as generalized relationship for all of the fabric samples. Statistical adequacy analysis and validation of the developed relationships show a strong ability and accuracy to predict the fabric tensile strength from yarn properties and fabric construction and to determine the yarn tensile strength for a predefined tensile strength of fabric. The warp density and warp yarn strength were found to be the most dominant parameters in case of warp way fabric strength where as the weft density and weft yarn strength were found as the most prominent parameters in case of weft-way fabric strength. Contribution of selected parameters relative to each other for fabric tensile strength was also investigated and presented {{in the form of a}} <b>pie</b> <b>diagram.</b> The developed relationships can be used accurately within the specified limits of selected variables...|$|E

40|$|The Biodiversity {{assessment}} using ethnobotanical {{and ecological}} inspection complemented by genetic variation investigation of tree Juniperus excela was undertaken in Zarghoon Juniper Forest {{during the years}} 2009 - 11. In contemporary study the illustrious data assortment procedure entitled Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) -Type Participatory Assessment of Natural Resources (PANR) was applied. PRA tools social map, transit walk, structured, semi structured interviews and <b>pie</b> <b>diagrams</b> were used. PRA was piloted in five villages as central habitat of five constellations embraced of total 17 villages in Zarghoon Juniper ecosystem. Meetings with local communities {{both male and female}} separately were conducted and PRA tool carried out using charts and markers. Ethnobotanical assessment revealed that 60 %, 35 % and 5 % medicines were used orally, topically and boiled to inhale, respectively. Correspondingly, in case of parts of plants usage 57, 26, 10 and 7 % leaves, seeds, flower and roots were used, respectively. The socio-economic condition of the area indicated local community was deficient of basic amenities of life. The dependency on natural resources was high and unplanned land fragmentation occurred as the major source of income (90 %) was from agriculture and livestock rearing and only 10 % income by trade, services and labor. Rate of deforestation assessed by counting cut stumps, ranged from 6. 69 to 4. 70 /acre. Average Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) in inches above ground at 4. 5 measured and that ranged from highest 37. 13 to lowest as 29. 40. Goat made the dominant livestock population of 75 %, sheep 23 % and donkey 2 %. Sex ratio of J. excelsa showed predominance of male with a mean value of 103 Â± 23 ha-Â¹ (58 %), followed by female 64 Â± 51 ha-Â¹ (36 %) while bisexual were very rare (6 %). Anthropogenic pressure like lopping for timber 28 %, fuel wood 56 %, debarking 11 % and fencing 5 % of Juniper tree equally treacherous at all populations. Leaf samples of the key species J. excelsa were collected for DNA isolation as no genetic analysis was ever carried out in this area. Owing to the existence of impurities of high magnitude of secondary metabolites, a novel protocol was generated to isolate pure DNA essentially for tree J. excelsa, which exhibited rich genetic resources and diversity. Six microsatellite primers were inspected and four showed considerable polymorphic amplifications. The percentage of polymorphic bands of populations was great with a variation of 8. 8 % as of maximum (61. 8 %) at Killi Shaban and minimum (53 %) at Gunda. The polymorphism decreased with decrease in cover. The genetic diversity among populations also varied greatly, from 0. 1012 - 0. 2012 and their order in five villages were as Killi Shaban > Killi Tor Shore > Medadzai > Sarobai> Gunda. Results revealed a positive correlation between genetic diversity and annual mean precipitation, high and low temp and soil pH, and variance in these due to climate change might intimidate the genetic diversity and resources. The traditional healers are dwindling in number and traditional knowledge is threatened and might be exterminated in near future since younger generation is least interested in it. Therefore, it is preordained to preserve the indigenous knowledge. Geographical distance and density might have sound effects on genetic relationships, because genetic diversity improved even at short distance. Existing anthropogenic pressure on ecosystem can be curtailed by regulations implementations and financial assistance for sustainable resourse utilization to the unique Juniper ecosystem of Zarghoo...|$|R
