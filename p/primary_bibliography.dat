40|$|One of {{the most}} {{haunting}} stories of the American West is {{the legend of the}} 2 ̆ 2 orphan trains. 2 ̆ 2 Relating the practice of taking homeless children from the teeming cities and resettling them in the nation 2 ̆ 7 s heartland where they could grow and prosper as youngsters should, the story tacitly invokes some {{of the most}} potent of American myths-the Turner safety-valve theory, the Horatio Alger tale of the self-made person, and, more darkly, the lingering traces of Social Darwinism. The Orphan Trains strives to set the record straightnot to debunk the legend, but to give it its proper niche in western history. Emphasizing the New York Children 2 ̆ 7 s Aid Society but giving attention to other agencies, it explores the placing-out movement from its origins in the 1850 s to its disappearance in the late 1920 s, providing an account satisfying for nonspecialists yet bolstered with <b>primary</b> <b>bibliography</b> enough to aid specialists in deeper inquiries...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to Elizabeth Bowen‘s search for the new counter-discourses of {{femininity}} that encompass undeniably important questions of subjectification and identification. It analyses the two chosen novels: The House in Paris (1935 / 1976) and Eva Trout, or Changing Scenes (1968 / 1999) as the <b>primary</b> <b>bibliography</b> and as Elizabeth Bowen‘s successful exercises in laying the foundations for her precursory philosophy of narrativization of identity through {{the analysis of the}} following processes: the search within the external and internal relations of selfhood and otherness and {{a better understanding of the}} founding concepts of maternity, femininity, and gender. It uses various theories of feminist scholarship postulated during the last thirty years of the twentieth century until the first decade of the new century. Moreover, the thesis focuses on the ideas of narrative, hermeneutical and dynamic approaches to the themes of identity and gender. The theoretical deliberations are, thus, based on the writings of Nancy Chodorow, Julia Kristeva, Elizabeth Grosz, Mikhail Bakhtin, Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guatarri, Emmanuel Levinas, and Paul Ricoeur among many others...|$|E
40|$|Prior {{to contact}} with European culture, Eskimos in the {{circumpolar}} world had a highly developed oral tradition. The subsequent widespread adoption of Christianity in the Arctic region resulted in nearly universal literacy among Eskimo adults, and {{the oral tradition}} almost immediately began to develop into a written one. In Canada {{there is now a}} considerable body of Inuit literature available in both Inuktitut and English, and this thesis examines how this literature developed. A brief history of European contact as it affected literacy, a consideration of the movement from the oral to written tradition, and a description of early Inuktitut publications, lead to a discussion of the poetry and prose of both the oral and written traditions. A discussion of some of the themes and structures evident in the contemporary written literature indicates that there are strong ties between the old and new literature, despite fairly drastic differences in subject matter and language. Additions to the body of the thesis include an illustrated appendix of Inuktitut writing systems, an illustrated appendix listing over 100 relevant periodicals by and about Inuit and a <b>primary</b> <b>bibliography</b> of approximately 750 books, articles, stories and poems by Inuit authors...|$|E
40|$|The "end of the century" nourishes a {{questioning}} movement on {{national identity and}} {{on the concept of}} modernity that is encouraged by the Quebec essayists. We propose an organization of the elements of the sovereign narrative which would be able to conduct and constitute a generative grammar of its argumentation. Our project consists in creating a matrix of the nationalistic discourse during the 1995 Quebec referendum period on sovereignty. This schematic figure will bring to its most simple expression the narrative of the Quebec nationalistic discourse selecting examples from ten texts of our <b>primary</b> <b>bibliography.</b> Our matrix will incorporate ideas, dogmas, theories, facts and myths stemming from the ideological discourses. We will see how these elements do interact, to be able afterwards to gather them in a framework on which national identity and legitimity of the national accession to sovereignty should be based. The study of this narrative of the past, as well as the analysis of the public characters will be leaded by the sociocritical approach of discourse analysis. The francophone cultural nation living on the territory of the Province of Quebec demonstrates itself through the values of tenacity, solidarity, labour and openness of mind towards "Others". The nation increases the standing of a society project based on a democratic basis, condemning the traitors of the Quebec nation. This history concerns the francophone majority even though it is linked to the other "oppressed peoples" of the World History. This "french-quebecer" history is enhanced with a collective memory, projected towards the future in making the project of sovereignty the purpose of its teleological progression...|$|E

40|$|Sorry, {{the full}} text of this article is not {{available}} in Huskie Commons. Please click on the alternative location to access it. 359 p. Eleanor Clark's career as an American writer has spanned more than fifty years. Since 1934 she has published four novels, three nonfiction works on places, a memoir, a play, a book for children, some thirty reviews, and several dozen essays and short stories; she has also translated the works of others. Yet she remains one of this country's lesser known writers. Although her work won a National Book Award for Arts and Letters, two Guggenheim fellowships, praise from reviewers, and some measure of popular success as well, it has never been studied in a systematic, scholarly way. This study is an attempt {{to pave the way for}} future scholarship by gathering in one place previously published material about Clark's life and works and by providing annotated bibliographies of primary and secondary material. In addition, an overview of the content of her book-length works gives an indication of both Clark's writing style and the themes with which she has remained concerned throughout her career. Chapter 1 is a biographical and bibliographical essay on Clark which synthesizes information about her life and about the reception of her works. Chapter 2 is an annotated <b>primary</b> <b>bibliography</b> of Clark's published works; Chapter 3, an annotated bibliography of secondary sources, that is, writings about her works. Chapter 4 is a survey of Clark's book-length nonfictional works: Rome and a Villa (1952; 2 nd ed. 1974), The Oysters of Locmariaquer (1964), Eyes, Etc. : A Memoir (1977), and Tamrart: 13 Days in the Sahara (1984). Chapter 5 is a survey of Clark's four novels, The Bitter Box (1946), Baldur's Gate (1970), Gloria Mundi (1979), and Camping Out (1986). Finally, a conclusion posits some reasons for the lack of extensive treatment of Clark's writings and suggests possible directions for further study...|$|E
40|$|MOTHER TONGUE, CORPUS AND NORMATIVITY: FROM HISPANIC AMERICA TO LATIN AMERICA The {{objective}} {{of the project was}} to study the formation of a common language in Hispanic America during the 19 th century and early 20 th century. The study is conducted in the framework of the configuration of nation states, an area in which policies of modern languages allow communicative exchanges {{on the basis of the}} foundation of what is common at a continental level; an interiorized socius of signs that allow for civic, public and private pleas. Discourses of the authors selected for this study will be addressed insofar as they postulate an American Spanish language that matches the changes of names for America: from Hispanic America it acquires the title of Latin America in the context of North American expansion. The study developed is a philosophic-literary study that had the {{objective of}} identifying sensualist, eclectic and modernist trends and some aspects of literary avant-gardism, besides addressing topics on gender. In order to execute the project, a <b>primary</b> <b>bibliography</b> that gathers a selected group of thinkers such as Félix Varela, Simón Rodríguez, Andrés Bello, José Martí, Rubén Darío, Manuel González Prada, Victorino Lastarria, Jose Hernández and Gabriela Mistral (Hostos and Rodó were added) was considered. This selection was made on the basis of relevance of their reflection on the language from idiomatic (cultural context of meaning), grammatical (normative aspects of syntax rationalization that accentuate the denotation) or stylistic (use of rhetoric tropes that are anomalous in regard to the normative usage) emphases. In turn, this research took into account the critical discourse that arises in Hispanic literature on the authors of the primary biography, given that their evaluations are a reflection that elaborates concepts that are fundamental for this research. Three reading hypotheses were developed in the project, all with the common axis of a plea to a mother corpus that affiliates dispersed elements whether normatively, in a native mode or under modern styles. Thus, the mother corpus appears in a "grammatical” (first year), "idiomatic” (second year) and “stylistic) (third year) dimension. The hypothesis of the mother corpus as a way of connecting, reads in the works of language thinkers an inscription in a scene that aims to gather a depleted or dispersed corpus as a way of remedying the fragmented, for which a fresh start is made. As it will be shown, only by the end of the century and under the name of “Our America”, authors such as Martí propose to integrate the indigenous populations and discuss aspects of commercialization and modernization of the end of the century. At the end of the study, aspects of modernity and modernization in regard to the new, the mercantile, the democratic and the industrial were addressed.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is {{the analysis of the}} female characters, members of the second generation, created by Meera Syal, Nisha Minhas and B. K. Mahal {{from the point of view}} of discourse and gender identity in a context of multiculturalism and culture clash like the British. I propose a reading of their books as a metaphor of conduct books following Armstrong and Tennenhouse (1987), and which point to the construction of new models of femininity. The reasons for having chosen these authors and works are of a different kind. All of them are female writers born in England but whose parents came from the Indian Subcontinent. As such not only are they aware of contemporary British society but they are also direct heirs of the attitude concerning first generation Indians. They are also more sensitive as to the role of women, their identity and the importance of their struggle to gain their own ground and break with all the expectations, stereotypes and demands made on them in social terms. In Chapter 1 the focus of attention is laid on the selection of some issues that better approached the reading of the <b>primary</b> <b>bibliography</b> along the line of conduct books as far as identity, gender and ideology are concerned. The treatment of issues from the point of view of British Asian women as direct receptors of a dual message and the female writers’ desire to have their voices heard emphasise gender consciousness and polarisation in the reformulation of social and cultural roles, a polarisation forced by a strict social order which is symbolically changing from the silence and subjugation of its women to a system where the self prevails over traditional norms. Chapter 2 gathers some key issues on Indian culture as the frame within which to better understand its precepts and to situate and analyse the gender conflict in a dual culture, the British one. All the concerns derive from the maintenance of tradition and point to an indirect guide of conduct whose fulfilment is weakening and becoming subject to negotiation and rethinking on a social, cultural and political scale. Whereas in previous years the voice of women was silenced, what these female writers are doing is revealing the experiences of individuals not wishing to be known for the same submissiveness and culture barriers imposed on their mothers. Chapter 3 focuses on the possible terminology to refer to this new literature and the new projects aimed at the spread and knowledge of new writers from different ethnic communities. In Chapter four the discussion is organised around selected passages from the <b>primary</b> <b>bibliography</b> as the starting point for analysis and comparison with the theoretical accounts from chapters one and two. The preservation of the rules historically dictated by tradition is being challenged and redefined not without a set of subsequent conflicts and controversies of what means living between two worlds-the Hindu -Sikh heritage and a new dual British identity. A perspective is provided by the reality of the Indian household and another one by the outside world. Even within the same family, the battle between tradition and contemporaneity is observed on the diversity of opinions. Consequently, the challenge of power relations is being redefined in the micro context of the Indian household so as to transfer it to the community first and then to a more global sphere. Given the difficulty to achieve personal fulfilment the female characters create their own strategies of survival. With this not only do they offer a new and modified discourse on the pillars of Indian culture but also a new reading of the existing stereotypes. L´objectiu d’ aquesta tesi doctoral és l´anàlisi dels personatges femenins, membres de la segona generació, creats per Meera Syal, Nisha Minhas i B. K. Mahal des del punt de vista del discurs i de la identitat de gènere en el context multicultural i de xoc de cultures britànic. Així mateix, es propasa una lectura de les seues obres com a metàfora de manuals de conducta seguint a Armstrong and Tennenhouse (1987) i, que com a tal, apunten a la construcció de nous models de femininitat. La importància i l´elecció d´aquestes autores respon a diversos motius. Per una banda, es tracta d´autores nascudes a Anglaterra de pares procedents de l´Índia i, per tant, hereves directes de dos bagatges culturals oposats. Molts dels seus personatges femenins adopten una actitud crítica que qüestiona, entre altres aspectes, la imposició de formes de comportament codificades sobre els fills, nascuts i educats a Gran Bretanya. De fet, i com s´observa en les obres analitzades, en el context multicultural britànic els membres de la primera generació encara intenten reproduir formes de desig acceptades a l´Índia però que els nous personatges reten i redefineixen en un procés de qüestionament i final renegociació de la tradició. Donada la dificultat d’ autorealització creen les seues pròpies estratègies de supervivència i ofereixen no només un nou discurs dels principis que regeixen la cultura índia sinó també una nova lectura dels estereotips imposats. Per l´altra, en el moment de tancament del corpus destacava la dificultat de trobar escriptores que se centraren en els problemes i experiències de la comunitat britànico-asiàtica. La tesi es divideix en quatre parts. La primera inlcou alguns supòsits teòrics sobre el gènere en relació als conceptes d´identitat, llenguatge i ideologia. La segona introdueix el lector en alguns dels aspectes que han definit la cultura índia a través de les diferents generacions. Alguns d´aquests aspectes inclouen, sempre amb la tradició com a punt d´origen, la posició de la dona, la família, el matrimoni o la sexualitat, entre altres, per després comparar-los amb la situació a Anglaterra. La tercera intenta ser un acostament a la possible terminologia per a referir-se a aquest tipus de literatura i a l´aparició de projectes. En la quarta, la discussió s´organitza a partir d´alguns fragments triats de la bibliografia bàsica per al seu análisi i comparació...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: The article {{explores the}} life and work of the Slovenian author Lojze Novak {{in order to get}} more {{recognition}} of the author in Slovenia. The article initially deals with the publishing activities of Argentina's diaspora. Methodology/approach : In order to create the bibliography the following bibliographic methods were used: searching and collecting the Novak´s works, bibliographic description as well as the arrangement of his opus. Novak´s works were obtained from Argentina, specifically from the Tine Debeljak legacy, Novak’s descendants, his contemporaries, friends and acquaintances, and from the National and University Library (NUK). Bibliographic descriptions are based on the primary documents therefore the data are accurate and verified. Bibliographic descriptions follow the Guidelines for the application of the ISBDs to the description of component parts (1998). Novak's personal bibliography includes 60 units arranged into published (52) and unpublished (8) works. Published works which consist of works of fiction (46) and nonfiction (6) are arranged chronologically by the publication year whereas within each year they are organised alphabetically. Novak´s biobibliography which includes 6 works and is arranged chronologically has also been produced through this process. Results: Since the author Lojze Novak has not won recognition in Slovenia yet, he has been introduced to our country by the personal bibliography and biobibliography that resulted from this research. Originality/practical implications: By doing the research into Novak´s opus eight of his unpublished works in manuscript form were discovered and included in his <b>primary</b> personal <b>bibliography.</b> It is therefore a comprehensive bibliography in the field. </p...|$|R

Saturn’s Moons brings together in one volume a wealth of new critical and visual material on Sebald’s life and works, covering the many facets and phases of his literary and academic careers — as teacher, as scholar and critic, as colleague and as collaborator on translation. Lavishly illustrated, the Handbook also contains a number of rediscovered short pieces by W. G.

40|$|About the book: Denis Williams, painter, teacher, novelist, archaeologist, and {{cultural}} administrator, {{is one of}} the founding fathers of modern Guyana. His involvement in several of the country’s key cultural institutions and his pioneering work on Guyana’s founding peoples ensures him a special place in the country’s history books. Williams also contributed to the outpouring of literature that accompanied the awakening consciousness of Caribbean nations and their drive for independence. His literary work is seminal in depicting the character of the Caribbean person and landscape, and the nature of ancestral (African and Afro-Caribbean) identities. His studies of African art and culture encouraged the young nation of Guyana to turn away from Western epistemologies and to pay serious intellectual attention to other origins. His research into the archaeology and culture of the Amerindian population of Guyana and beyond laid the pathway for further scholarship. The essays assembled here bring together eminent scholars and commentators to offer authoritative analyses of the various aspects of Williams’s work – artistic, academic, and literary – and capture the rationale for, the interconnections between, and the evident trajectory of Williams’s life work as the epitome of the changing nature of the Caribbean condition. As well as wide-ranging biographical essays, and studies of Williams’s activities as a painter, the collection contains a comprehensive <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>bibliography,</b> a generous selection of colour plates, and individual essays devoted to the published novels (Other Leopards; The Third Temptation) and other published and unpublished fiction, and to Williams’s archaeological masterpiece, Prehistoric Guiana. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the appropriation of}} antique art in Italy during the fourteenth century. In order to do that, it considers the surviving antiquities in late medieval Italian cities and examines their reception and perception by contemporary authors and artists. Following the introductory chapter, which sets out {{the aims of the}} thesis and provides a brief historical background of the period, this study is divided in two parts. Part I examines the awareness of ancient art in the Trecento by looking at late-medieval Italian texts. After an introduction of the relevant texts and a presentation of the biographical background of their authors, the chapters explore the reliability of the writers, their references to antique art and their particular interests towards antique art. They also examine the textual evidence on attitudes towards antiquity, contrasting the different approaches of intellectual and popular audiences, and discuss a number of surviving antique works that were placed in public places and were charged with ideological intent, meaning and power. Part II approaches the subject of the appropriation of antique art in the Trecento from a different angle and deals with the reaction of artists toward ancient art. It {{discusses the}} emergence of a new iconography that reflects themes arising from encounters with classical literary texts, explores instances of antique sculpture portrayed in fourteenth-century paintings, and examines the antique sources of various Trecento motifs and compositions.

The Encyclopedia covers established contemporary authors such as Toni Morrison and Gloria Naylor, along {{with a range of}} neglected and emerging figures. Each entry is written by an expert contributor and provides a brief biography, a discussion of major works, a survey of the author's critical reception, and <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>bibliographies.</b> Literature students will value this book for its exploration of African American literature, while social studies students will appreciate its examination of social issues through literature. African American women writers have made an enormous contribution to our culture. Many of these authors wrote during the Harlem Renaissance, a particularly vital time in African American arts and letters, while others have been especially active since the 1970 s, an era in which works by African American women are adapted into films and are widely read in book clubs.

40|$|For my Honors thesis, which I am {{registered}} {{for in the}} fall of 2000, I would like to do a project surrounding the topic of contemporary church music. I want to study the historical progression of more recent contemporary church worship music. This will involve gaining a foundation of 19 " century worship music, but primarily focus on changes that have occurred since the 1970 's that have worked to fuse the formerly forbidden sounds of rock and pop into the church. I plan to present this research in a paper that will be an integrated summary of my reactions, analysis and criticism on all that has been studied. The bulk of my final product will {{take the form of a}} creative project. I want to record and remake 10 - 12 worship songs and put them on CD, to have a very tangible/creative project. I have been playing church music for about 8 years, and have taken classical guitar instruction at Ball State for four years. Along with having written and re-written many contemporary church songs that are in use now, I have played with a nationally known band "The Elms" and played at big events such as the Dove Awards, or the Christian equivalent of the Grammy's. I will do this with the utmost professionalism. I am experienced in recording and sound synthesis techniques, and have played and recorded my own as well as others music in a home studio for over 4 years. I have all the equipment and facilities to make this recording at home in southern Indiana, as well as a wealth of talented musicians who I am happy to call my friends. It is not as important that I receive credit in history or music for this project, but gain a broader background as to where church worship has been and where it is going in the future, as well as providing my own tangible contribution to its future. This is important because as the church changes musical formats to cater to a new, younger audience, embracing more contemporary styles and less formalism, it is important not to lose sight of doctrinal roots and do away with all tradition- therefore alienating a large number of people who are uncomfortable with such changes. In contrast "change," with new, fresh and bold ideas, should not be feared, and can be used within the context of church. Christianity is about a balance between grace and holiness. Grace without holiness, is blind, apathetic faith, while holiness without grace is strict legalism. I plan to work with a more than one advisor and have yet to find one who would fit as a primary one. As of now I am working and researching with Dr. Kevin Smith from the History Dept. to whom I was referred from Dr. T. Edmonds. To the extent that my project looks at contemporary music from a longterm historical perspective he has offered to be of some assistance, but to the extent that my project is more modern, he has recommended that another advisor may be more helpful, and useful. He has offered to serve as a supplemental advisor as of now, but recommends I talk to two of his colleagues: Professor (Lori) Rhoden in Music and Professor (Kerry) Jones in Math. I have also been referred to Dr. Doug Amman and Dr. Kirby Koriath. All of them are actually involved in music ministries at their respective churches, and may be more useful because they have had professional musical training.

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} inquire about {{the way in which}} the concept of {{sustainable}} development, which has been authorised by the United Nations as a global policy-guideline, has been adopted among the environmental scientists in Russia. The argument is that sustainable development, despite its status as a ’global’ development paradigm, is a culture-bound notion, representing elements that are alien to the Russian culture. At the same time, this is a study about Russia’s relationship with ’the west’, about {{the way in which the}} Russian culture interacts with the ’western’ one ­ adapts to it and challenges it. The main themes of the study are globalising environmental policy-making and the cultural mechanisms that govern the relationship between Russia and her western neighbours. 	 A heuristic starting point is provided by the Russian concept of 'ekologicheskaya bezopasnost', ecological safety. This is a concept that in the Russian environmental discourse occupies a position similar to that of sustainable development in the western context. The question is: what is the relationship between these two concepts? Is ecological safety replacing sustainable development or just complementing it, or maybe something else? The notion of ’boomerang effect’ by Isaiah Berlin will guide the inquiry in this respect. The concept of culture is central both in the theoretical and methodological orientations of this study. At the level of the concrete methodical application, the aim is {{to inquire about}} the cultural deep structures behind the concept of ecological safety with the help of an application of Yuri Lotman’s semiotics. Central tools include Lotman’s notions of symbolic model-images and their memory-function. Within this study, only the concept of ecological safety is analysed, but in order to make comparisons, a corresponding analysis of ’sustainable development’ will be taken up in the last section of the study. From the point of view of the theoretical application, ’culture’ incorporates what I consider relevant in International Relations: politics cannot be explained only by reference to some universal theories but instead cultural and historical factors should be taken seriously when explaining and understanding the things that take palce at the international arena. The main results of the study include, first of all, that there are both similarities and differences between the symbolic deep structures transmitted by the two concepts: sustainable development and ecological safety. Although both of these concepts draw from the archives of their own cultural memories, there are points where these coincide. A central conclusion concerns globalisation: it is important to examine it also as a form of cultural interaction and see the way in which ’the local’ is affected by ’the global’. The question about the cultural mechanisms in the relationship between Russia and ’the west’ is left open and it is certainly a topic for a further study. 1.
