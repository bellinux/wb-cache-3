40|$|Blogs are a {{valuable}} information source for health researchers and individuals managing chronic {{conditions such as}} obesity. Yet, there is little research on obesity blogs with existing studies focusing on specific obesity-related issues or examining blogging as a weight loss tool. Even less is known about how the overall obesity experience is conceptualised by blogging individuals and medical experts (particularly via metaphor - a device that aids discussions of sensitive issues) or the addressivity and self-presentation strategies employed on an interactive platform which affords tailored identity construction. This study analysed 343 posts from six (personal and <b>professional)</b> obesity <b>blogs</b> using critical metaphor analysis and addressivity analysis. The preferred source domain of metaphors in both blog types was Journey - with potentially positive implications for doctor-patient communication. Across blogs, Journey metaphors were recruited to highlight similar aspects of obesity in ways that challenged the mainstream before-after weight loss narrative. In personal blogs, Journey metaphors were employed to present the authors as travellers; in <b>professional</b> <b>blogs,</b> as guides. Metaphors thus contributed to self-presentations consistent with traditional views of the doctor-patient relationship. Finally, while individuals used various addressivity strategies, medical experts preferred those that project professionalism...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Weblogs (or blogs), {{as a form}} of {{communication}} on the Internet, have recently risen in prominence but may be poorly understood by both faculty and students. This article explains how blogs differ from other online communication tools and how political science faculty can make use of blogs in their classes. The focus is on using blogs as part of class assignments to reinforce important skills, including critical thinking, political engagement, and essay writing. We also discuss existing academic and <b>professional</b> <b>blogs</b> that may be models for student blogging in political science. Over the last decade, information technology (IT) innovations, including in-class presentation technologies, course content-management systems (such as Blackboard, WebCT, and Sakai 1), and e-mail, have transformed the ways that faculty teach and interact with students. Among the new technologies are a host of online tools, including Weblogs, wikis, discussion forums, and e-mail lists, that are often bundled into popula...|$|R

40|$|The <b>professional</b> <b>blog</b> is a weblog that on {{the whole}} meets the {{requirements}} of scientific publication. In my opinion it bear a resemblance to digital notice board, where the competent specialists of the given branch of science can place their ideas, questions, possible solutions and can raise problems. Its most important function can be collectivization of the knowledge. In this article I am going to examine {{the characteristics of the}} scientific blog as a genre. Conventional learning counts as a rather solitary activity. If the students have access to the materials of each other and of the teacher, their sense of solitude diminishes and this model is also closer to the constructivist approach that features the way most people think and learn. Learning does not mean passively collecting tiny pieces of knowledge; it much more esembles ‘spinning a conceptual net’ which is made up by the experiences and observations of the individual. With the spreading of the Internet more universities and colleges worldwide gave a try to on-line educational methods, but the most efficient one has not been found yet. The publication of the curriculum (the material of the lectures) and the handling of the electronic mails are not sufficient; much more is needed for collaborative learning. Our scholastic scientific blog can be a sufficient field for the start of a knowledge-building process based on cooperation. In the Rocard-report can be read that for the future of Europe it is crucial to develop the education of the natural sciences, and for this it isnecessary to act on local, regional, national and EU-level. To the educational processes should be involved beyond the traditional actors (child, parent, teacher) also others (scientists, professionals, universities, local institutions, the actors of the economic sphere, etc.). The scholastic scientific blog answer the purposes, as a collaborative knowledge-sharing forum...|$|E
