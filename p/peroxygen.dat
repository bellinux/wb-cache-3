40|$|To {{investigate}} the detailed mechanisms for brown coal oxidation at high temperatures, a ReaxFF reactive forcefield {{was used to}} perform a series of molecular dynamics simulations from 1000 ?K to 2500 ?K. Analyses indicated that the chemical system {{tend to be more}} reactive with increasing temperature. It was found that the oxidation process of brown coal primarily initiates from hydrogen abstraction reactions by O 2 and related oxygenated radicals from phenolic hydroxyl groups, methyl groups, especially carboxyl groups in lower temperature to form <b>peroxygen</b> species, or by either thermal decomposition of brown coal backbone in higher temperature. These <b>peroxygen</b> species usually could chemically adsorb on the C-centered radicals of brown coal backbone. The weak OO bond in <b>peroxygen</b> makes them easier to break into oxygenated radical, which could also chemically adsorb on the C-centred radical to form hydroxyl group and other oxygenated compounds. In the oxidation process of brown coal, the decomposition and oxidation of aliphatic chain is easier than aromatic ring.

We assessed sporulation and susceptibility of three PCR-ribotypes; 012, 017 and 027 to four classes of disinfectants; chlorine releasing agents (CRAs), <b>peroxygens,</b> quaternary ammonium compounds (QAC) and biguanides. The 017 PCR-ribotype, showed the highest sporulation frequency under these test conditions.

A wet model, for conditions such as boot dips, used disinfectant application to a slurry of poultry faeces inoculated with Salmonella Enteritidis or Salmonella Typhimurium. A dry model, for disinfectant application to surfaces and equipment with adherent or residual organic material, used Salmonella-inoculated poultry faeces that were air-dried onto wooden dowels, immersed in disinfectant solution then left in air at room temperature overnight. All samples were subjected to a disinfectant neutralisation step and resuscitation in broth, followed by Salmonella culture on semisolid then indicator media. Disinfectants were tested at 0. 5 x, 1 x and 2 x the concentrations specified for the general control of bacterial pathogens on livestock premises in the UK (Defra General Orders rates). Chlorocresol- based disinfectants provided consistently high rates of Salmonella killing in both wet and dry tests. Formaldehyde-containing disinfectants showed very high efficacy in the dry test but were less effective in the shorter wet test, whereas the efficacy of glutaraldehyde without formaldehyde was variable between products. Other chemical classes tested (quaternary ammonium compounds, amphoteric surfactants, iodine preparations, <b>peroxygens</b> and a substituted phenol blend) were only moderately effective.

40|$|Rotavirus is an enteric {{pathogen}} that causes {{morbidity and mortality}} in young mammals, including pigs. Outbreaks of rotavirus on commercial farms have a significant economic impact in terms of losses in production.

40|$|Recently, metal {{nanoparticles}} {{have attracted}} the attention of researchers in several fields of study due to their high surface area and other unique properties. Using metal nanoparticles as a component of an in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) system is emerging and hence very little information is available. In this research, nano zero valent iron (nZVI) particles and iron-based bimetallic zero valent nanoparticles (BZVNs) were employed to activate some common <b>peroxygens</b> (hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), persulfate (S 2 O 82 -), and peroxymonosulfate (HSO 5 -)) to degrade hazardous organic compounds. Aqueous and soil slurry batch systems were used along with a one-dimensional physical model. The results from the aqueous batch systems showed that nZVI is a promising activator for S 2 O 82 - compared to other conventional iron activators (e. g., granular-ZVI and Fe 2 +). For example, the initial trichloroethylene (TCE) reaction rate by nZVI activated S 2 O 82 - was 1. 11 x 10 - 4 M L- 1 min- 1 compared to an initial reaction rate of 6. 25 x 10 - 5 M L- 1 min- 1, 5. 18 x 10 - 6 M L- 1 min- 1, and 1. 8 x 10 - 7 M L- 1 min- 1 for Fe 2 + activated S 2 O 82 -, granular-ZVI activated S 2 O 82 -, and non-activated S 2 O 82 -, respectively. However, the surfaces of nZVI particles were passivated quickly following exposure to S 2 O 82 -, causing the reaction rate to reduce to a magnitude representative of an un-activated S 2 O 82 - system. An iron-sulfate (FeSO 4) complex was formed on the surfaces of the nZVI particles following exposure to S 2 O 82 - compared to the iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) layer that was present on fresh nZVI surfaces. BZVNs showed better treatment effectiveness than nZVI particles as activators for H 2 O 2, S 2 O 82 -, and HSO 5 -. For example, the TCE reaction rate constant for nano-Ag-Fe 0 activated H 2 O 2 was 9 to 18 fold higher than that for nZVI activated H 2 O 2. Of the nine different BZVNs investigated as activators, the greatest TCE degradation was achieved by nano-Pd-Fe 0 and nano-Zn-Fe 0 activated S 2 O 82 - system, nano-Co-Fe 0 activated HSO 5 - system, and nano-Ag-Fe 0 activated H 2 O 2 system. For all of these systems, an increase in the dosage of nanoparticles and <b>peroxygens</b> increased TCE degradation. The activated H 2 O 2 system showed a lower TCE degradation rate compared to either the activated S 2 O 82 - or the activated HSO 5 - systems, suggesting that a bridged group complex is formed between the activators and H 2 O 2. The dissolved TCE concentration remaining in the soil slurry batch systems after using the nano-Pd-Fe 0 activated S 2 O 82 - system was two to three fold higher than that in an aqueous batch system. Furthermore, for five different aquifer materials used, the higher mass of aquifer materials the lower the TCE degradation, indicating that the aquifer materials compete with a target organic compound in the presence of activated S 2 O 82 -. A linear relationship was observed between the organic carbon (OC) content and the initial TCE decomposition rate. Although there is no direct evidence of the effect of OC on the treatment system, it is suggested that the OC may result in scavenging the generated free radicals or by directly consuming persulfate. In the one-dimensional physical model systems, bimetallic nanoparticles were mobile in a non-geological porous medium and relatively immobile in a geological porous medium. In the non-geological porous medium, we found that adding a second metal (e. g., Pd) to nano-Fe 0 particles significantly improved their functionality and performance (e. g., mobility and suspension). For example, the results from mobility experiments using columns packed with glass beads showed that the effluent iron concentration was < 6 % of the influent iron concentration for the nano-Fe 0 particles, while it was ~ 100 % for the nano-Pd-Fe 0 particles. In the geological porous medium, based on visual inspection, nano-Pd-Fe 0 particles could not travel more than a few centimeters into columns packed with CFB Borden sand, and no iron was detected in the effluent. To overcome the delivery issue in porous media, nano-Pd-Fe 0 particles were injected to create a zone of activation to activate S 2 O 82 - for the treatment of TCE source zone. However, we found that the TCE mass destruction was only 9 % higher in the nano-Pd-Fe 0 activated S 2 O 82 - system compared to the non-activated S 2 O 82 - system as revealed by the effluent chloride concentration. In addition, the activation zone composed of nano-Pd-Fe 0 particles was rapidly deactivated after exposure to persulfate as visually observed by color change, indicating that the longevity of the activation zone is limited. This research effort provides a contribution to the field of ISCO by evaluating the potential utility and applicability of a new class of activators for some common <b>peroxygens...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background. Non-porous {{environmental}} surfaces accidentally/deliberately {{contaminated with}} bioagents might {{play a role}} in the spread of infections. The risk of such spread can be reduced with judicious use of liquid chemical disinfectants. Such chemicals are usually applied directly on the target surface as a liquid by immersion, flooding, spray, or by wiping with a disinfectant-wetted fabric. However, the assessments and label claims of microbicidal activities of such chemicals are often based on testing against individual classes of microbes without an appropriate soil load, while pathogens in the field are either unknown or may exist as mixtures in body fluids or other organic/inorganic debris. Further more, the influence of the mechanical action of wiping in decontaminating surfaces is hardly ever assessed. Wiping microbially-contaminated surfaces with an ineffective disinfectant may also spread localized contamination over a wider area, thus enhancing the risk of spread of infections. The potential impact of such spread remains virtually unknown. This study was, therefore, aimed at filling these three gaps in our knowledge. Experimental. To simulate field conditions better, the challenge was a cocktail of bacterial spores (Geobacillus stearothermophilus), a vegetative bacterium (Acinetobacter baumannii), a mycobacterium (Mycobacterium terrae), and a non-enveloped virus (hepatitis A) in a soil load. Disks (1 cm in diameter) of brushed stainless steel were used as prototypical hard, non-porous environmental surface. Each disk received 10 muL of the microbial suspension. The inoculum was then dried prior to direct contact with the test disinfectant or assessing the effect of wiping for decontamination and transfer of contamination. In both decontamination methods, normal buffered saline (NBS) was used as the control fluid. Results. The microbial mixture successfully evaluated the efficacy claims and spectrum of activity of disinfectants concurrently, with no major differences in inactivation of microbes when challenged alone or as a mixture. Surprisingly, peracetic acid (PAA; 1, 000 ppm) and accelerated hydrogen peroxide (AHP) -based formulations (40, 000 to 70, 000 ppm) reduced the viability of the spores to undetectable levels, but without complete inactivation of the virus at the same contact time and temperature. Chlorine dioxide (CD) and a 5. 25 % (w/v) solution of sodium hypochlorite, i. e., domestic bleach (DB), showed the broadest spectrum of microbicidal activity. However, their activities depended on air temperature. While CD (500 and 1, 000 ppm) and DB (5, 000 ppm) completely inactivated HAV and the spores at room temperature (∼ 22 - 24 °C), these formulations only killed the virus at 4 °C but not the spores. M. terrae and A. baumannii were relatively readily inactivated and proved to be very similar in their sensitivities to all the tested chemicals. In general, wiping with a disinfectant-wetted fabric was more effective than direct kill for decontamination. Our data suggested that applying a formulation directly on to a contaminated surface, letting it dry, and then wiping the surface with a disinfectant helped achieve greater log 10 reductions while reducing substantially the risk of transfer of contaminants to clean areas. Conclusions. This study assessed the relative strengths and the spectrum of activity of the tested formulations concurrently and under conditions more akin to those expected under field conditions. Incorporation of a cocktail of microorganisms into a single test permitted a more reliable means of classifying microbicides based on their spectrum of activity. Chlorine releasing agents proved to be more effective and have a broader spectrum of activity as compared to the <b>peroxygens.</b> Disinfectant activity depended on air temperature, and none of them was effective against the spores at 4 °C. Decontamination by wiping with disinfectants proved to be faster and more effective than direct kill. However, a higher risk of a wider spread of contamination during wiping was also evident in this study. The foundations laid by this investigation should allow more detailed studies using actual infectious bioagents. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

The chemical was tested on different bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli), spores (Bacillus subtilis) and on the Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and compared in its activity with phenol and glutaraldehyde (calculation of the 'phenol coefficient' and the 'glutaraldehyde coefficient'). The constancy of speed of disinfection, the coefficient of concentration, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) were also determined, and the destruction of the HBsAg antigenic activity was studied using an ELISA kit. The sporicidal efficacy of Virkon was assessed by cultivating spores in agar nutrient after contact with different dilutions of the disinfectant. The results of the tests showed that Virkon has a high concentration coefficient (mean value of k: 0. 374 /min) and a wide range of action. The low MIC demonstrates how little concentrations of Virkon can inactivate all studied bacteria.

Spores of nonvirulent Bacillus anthracis strains 7702, ANR- 1, and 9131 were mixed with water, flour paste, whole milk, or egg yolk emulsion and dried onto stainless-steel carriers. The carriers were exposed to various concentrations of peroxyacetic acid, sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), or hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) for 10 min at 10, 20, or 30 °C, after which time the survivors were quantified. The relationship between peroxyacetic acid concentration, H 2 O 2 concentration, and spore inactivation followed a sigmoid curve that was accurately described using a four-parameter logistic model. At 20 °C, the minimum concentrations of peroxyacetic acid, H 2 O 2, and NaOCl (as total available chlorine) predicted to inactivate 6 log 10 CFU of B. anthracis spores with no food residue present were 1. 05, 23. 0, and 0. 78 %, respectively. At 10 °C, sodium hypochlorite at 5 % total available chlorine did not inactivate more than 4 log 10 CFU. The presence of the food residues had only a minimal effect on peroxyacetic acid and H 2 O 2 sporicidal efficacy, but the efficacy of sodium hypochlorite was markedly inhibited by whole-milk and egg yolk residues.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Washington State UniversityThree {{different}} topics {{related to}} the activation of persulfate, {{and the application of}} reactive <b>peroxygen</b> system for recalcitrant contaminant remediation, and regeneration of used activated carbon were studied. An introduction that covers theory and motivation for the research is presented in the first chapter. The second chapter examines the degradation of a recalcitrant fluorocarbon, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), by reactive species generated through catalyzed hydrogen peroxide propagation (CHP) reactions. The results of this research demonstrate that CHP formulation is effective degrading PFOA. Although hydroxyl radical does not degrade PFOA, CHP systems are effective in treating PFOA via nucleophilic attack by superoxide and hydroperoxide. In addition, PFOA degradation products included short chain fluorocarbons, such as 2, 2 -difluoropropane, which is an indication of a nucleophilic attack and the generation of fluoride confirms PFOA destruction. An innovative technique for persulfate activation is discussed in the third chapter of this dissertation. The potential for glucose as a persulfate activator was investigated at both acidic pH (3) and basic pH (12. 5). The results of this research demonstrate that glucose can activate persulfate in both acidic and basic pH regimes; however, the rates of oxidant and reductant generation are higher at basic pH (12. 5), most likely due to the higher ionization of glucose (pKa= 12. 28). The results of this research also demonstrate that depending on the pH and persulfate concentration, a minimum concentration of glucose is needed for the effective generation of oxidants and reductants. The fourth chapter examines the regeneration potential of granular activated carbon (GAC) by two superoxide systems: hydrogen peroxide-bicarbonate system, and percarbonate system. Treatment efficiency of these systems increased with increasing oxidants (hydrogen peroxide, and percarbonate) concentration. Nearly complete desorption and destruction of toluene from GAC surface was achieved by 1 M hydrogen peroxide-bicarbonate, and 1 M percarbonate system at pH 12. 5. However, the desorption and destruction of octanol- 1 in 1 M hydrogen peroxide-bicarbonate, and 1 M percarbonate system at pH 12. 5 was < 86 %. Because 1 -octanol is more hydrophobic than toluene, hydrophobicity might affect the regeneration of GAC. To investigate the effect of hydrophobicity of organic contaminants on the regeneration of GAC, 3 compounds of varying degree of hydrophobicity were evaluated: toluene, naphthalene, and phenanthrene. The desorption efficiency was inversely proportional to contaminants hydrophobicity. The results of this research demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide-bicarbonate system and percarbonate system are effective in regenerating GAC and may have potential for in situ carbon regeneration in full scale systems.
