5000|$|Since, by regulation, (subsequently changed) the Pensacola to Mobile {{portion of}} the flight was not an {{extended}} overwater flight, the <b>passenger</b> <b>briefing</b> {{did not include the}} location and use of water survival equipment. Therefore many passengers were not aware of the location of the life vests, how to don them, how to use them, and the location and use of the life vest's emergency lights. Those passengers who knew or were told that the life vests were stowed in compartments beneath the seats had difficulty extracting them. Rising water in the cabin compounded the problems of locating and removing the vests from the underseat compartments.|$|E

50|$|Use as a {{route for}} long-distance <b>passenger</b> traffic was <b>brief.</b> With the {{connection}} of the Boxtel Railway to the bridge over the Rhine at Wesel before the First World War, a long-distance connection was established on the (London-) Vlissingen-Wesel-Osnabrück-Berlin-Eydtkuhnen (now Chernyshevskoye)-Saint Petersburg route.

5000|$|The {{cabin crew}} on a {{passenger}} aircraft are integral to getting passengers to assume positions. If time allows in a developing emergency, the cabin crew can <b>brief</b> <b>passengers</b> {{on how to}} properly adopt the brace position. Cabin crew are also trained to recognize emergency situations where an impact may be possible (for example, flight attendants sense that the take-off is not going as usual). Immediately before the emergency landing, the flight deck usually gives a pre-arranged signal (such as the command [...] "Brace for impact" [...] or [...] "Cabin crew and passengers, brace brace." [...] over the public announcement system or flashing the fasten seat-belt sign several times), whereupon the cabin crew shouts commands to passengers and repeat until the plane has safely landed on the ground.

A live demonstration is performed by a flight attendant/s standing up in the aisle/s, while another flight attendant narrates over the public address system. A pre-recorded briefing may feature audio only, or may {{take the form of a}} video (audio plus visual). Pre-flight safety briefings typically last two to six minutes. In consideration for travelers not speaking the airline's official language and for the passengers with hearing problems, the video may feature subtitles, an on-screen signer, or may be repeated in another language.|$|R

Özgecan was last seen by her friend, who exited the minibus, leaving Özgecan alone in the minibus. As Özgecan did not return home after nightfall, she was reported missing. Meanwhile, the minibus driver stopped at a Gendarmerie checkpoint to ask for directions, but instead of following the directions, diverted into a forest. The gendarme became suspicious and stopped the vehicle to find smears of blood, which the driver claimed had been caused by a fight between <b>passengers.</b> After a <b>brief</b> investigation, the suspects were released. After Özgecan was reported missing, the gendarme started to look for the minibus again. It was captured with two of the suspects; Özgecan's hat (confirmed as hers by her father) was found inside. The two suspects subsequently admitted the murder, and the search for the third suspect began.|$|R
500|$|The LIRR's appeal {{took the}} case to the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court, for the Second Department, the state's {{intermediate}} appeals court. In its briefs before the Appellate Division, the LIRR argued that the verdict had been contrary to the law and the evidence. It stressed that it had no foreknowledge that the package was dangerous, and that no law required it to search the contents of <b>passenger</b> luggage. The <b>brief</b> stated that given this, there was no negligence in helping a man make a train, and even if there was, that negligence was not the proximate cause of Palsgraf's injuries. Wood, for Palsgraf, argued that the jury verdict finding negligence was supported by undisputed facts, and should not be questioned by the appellate courts. The plaintiff's brief also suggested that the failure of the railroad to call as witnesses the employees who had aided the man should decide any inferences of negligence against it. Wood deemed the trainmen guilty of a [...] "dereliction of duty", misconduct that was the proximate cause of Palsgraf's injuries.|$|R
50|$|Kobras {{is ready}} for him, and his henchmen swarm out to shoot down Tony. He manages to evade them, and even captures one to {{interrogate}} him about where Kobras is keeping the mask, {{but it turns out}} the location is kept secret from the henchmen. Meanwhile, Vadinho has used his mystical amulet to find out that Kobras is in a mansion of some kind. He tells Tony to use his teleportation powers to find it, but it turns out he cannot warp to a location he has not visited. Tony concocts an alternate plan to find the mansion, and contacts his policeman friend Martin to obtain an electronic position indicator. When he returns to the warehouse, however, it turns out Vadinho has been captured by Kobras' henchmen, and he fights them off with his powers of flight, teleportation and super-strength. With the henchmen defeated, he teleports into Jane's car. When she refuses to tell him the mansion's location due to being under Kobras' control, he hides the position indicator under the <b>passenger</b> seat. A <b>brief</b> chase breaks out as Kobras' henchmen pursue him, but he teleports back to the warehouse. Kobras deduces from Jane's reluctance to kill Tony that her affection for him is weakening his mind control.|$|R
40|$|Saturday, December 29, 2007, 19 : 35 EST (07 : 35 PM EST) CDCHAN- 00267 - 2007 - 12 - 29 -ADV-NThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{is working}} with international, state, and local health {{officials}} and other partners on an investigation involving an international traveler to the U. S. who had recently been diagnosed with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB). CDC was informed in mid-December 2007 by a local health authority that a patient who had been diagnosed in India with MDR TB traveled from New Delhi, India to Chicago, Illinois on December 13, 2007 on American Airlines Flight # 293 and then on a shorter flight within the United States. Shortly after final arrival, the patient sought treatment for hemoptysis, fever, and chest pain at a hospital. These and other findings indicated a potential for transmission of drug-resistant TB infection to others. The patient has been hospitalized in airborne isolation and is receiving treatment for TB. Shortly after being notified about the patient and her travels, officials of CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine contacted American Airlines and U. S. Customs and Border Protection to obtain the information needed to contact passengers {{who may have been}} exposed to the traveler with tuberculosis. CDC is collaborating with U. S. state and local health departments, the Indian Ministry of Family Welfare, American Airlines, and the Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection to ensure notification and follow-up of passengers and crew who may have been exposed to MDR TB. In accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) TB and Airline Travel Guidelines, CDC is ensuring appropriate follow-up and care for persons who may have been exposed to TB on an aircraft. This includes recommending the evaluation and testing of passengers and crew with closest contact to the patient on board American Airlines Flight # 293 departing from New Delhi, India on December 13, 2007 and arriving in Chicago, Illinois on December 13, 2007. This includes 44 passengers. These were the passengers seated in the same row as the index patient (row 35), and those seated in the two rows ahead (rows 33 and 34) and the two rows behind (rows 36 and 37), as well as the crew members working in the same cabin. These persons should receive an initial evaluation and testing for TB infection, with follow-up 8 to 10 weeks after the December 13 flight for reevaluation. CDC recommends testing of these passengers and crew on only the international flight from New Delhi to Chicago because this flight was longer than the 8 hour duration criteria specified by WHO for passenger testing for exposure to tuberculosis. WHO and CDC do not recommend notification or medical evaluation of <b>passengers</b> on <b>briefer</b> flights because the risk of transmission is minimal. WHO guidelines can be found at [URL] Tuberculosis (December 2007) BacteriaMycobacterium tuberculosi...|$|R
500|$|Great Moments in Aviation {{was written}} by Jeanette Winterson, {{directed}} by Beeban Kidron and produced by Phillippa Giles, the same creative team who, in 1990, adapted Winterson's novel Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit for television. Giles, for whom Great Moments was her first feature film, believes {{that it was the}} success of Oranges which lead the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) to approve the film so easily. The screenplay is inspired by the emigration story of the mother of actress Vicky Licorish, a close friend of Winterson. It is adapted from a short story Winterson wrote entitled [...] "Atlantic Crossing", published in 1999 in her anthology The World and Other Places. The central themes of the story are [...] "race, Hemingway, colonialism, love, lust, the [...] '50s", adapted into the screenplay in a manner Winterson intended to be reminiscent of a fairytale. She ascribes the roles of hero and heroine to Duncan and Gabriel, fairy godmothers to Miss Quim and Dr Bead, and non-archetypal villain to Rex Goodyear. Setting the film on a <b>passenger</b> liner, with <b>brief</b> scenes in Gabriel's native Grenada were intended to contribute towards this fairytale atmosphere, with Winterson explaining that the opening sequence in the Caribbean is [...] "designed to draw the audience out of the world of their own concerns and into a world whose customs are strange. In the new world, objects are unfamiliar and events do not follow the usual rules. The coincidence of colour and language, each more vivid than normal, pull the viewer forward with fairytale immediacy." [...] Of the passenger liner aspect, she explains that it provides the film with: [...] "a sealed and contained world with its own identity and rituals, at once both recognisable and odd. Fairytale never leaves the reader in a familiar spot, we are whisked away to a wood or a lake or a castle or an island, each a law unto itself made all the more uncomfortable because it isn't as weird as, say, planet Mars. We think {{we will be able to}} cope just by using out usual tool kit, how disconcerting it is when we can't." ...|$|R
50|$|More {{difficulties}} were encountered at the overwing exits. The left overwing exit {{could not}} be used because it was blocked by smoke and flames. The passenger seated at the right overwing exit had difficulty understanding how to operate the hatch. At that time, there was no requirement that exit-row <b>passengers</b> receive a <b>briefing</b> on how and when to open the hatch. Once the 48 lb hatch was released, it fell inward onto the passenger seated next to it, trapping her. Two passengers lifted the hatch and put it on a seat in the next row back, making the exit available for use 45 seconds after the aircraft had stopped. Once the hatch had been removed, passengers still encountered difficulties in getting to and using this exit. The exit row seats allowed only 10.5 inches of space to pass through, the armrests between those seats remained down, and the exit was situated directly over a seat, requiring passengers to manoeuvre awkwardly to make their escape. Passengers {{in the rear of the}} aircraft were panicking as smoke, and eventually flames, filled the hot cabin at about the same time the right overwing exit was opened. Passengers crawled over seat backs to get to the right overwing exit as well as the two front exits; some survivors told investigators that the aisle had become blocked with bodies. Not only did this cause jamming at all exits, the seat over which the overwing exit was located failed in such a way that the seat back collapsed forward, providing a further obstruction. A man who had been seated in 16C was found dead lying across this exit, and investigators were unsure whether the seat back collapse had trapped the man, preventing his escape. A fourteen-year-old boy was found lying across the top of the man from seat 16C by firefighters 5.5 minutes after the aircraft had stopped. He was alive, suffering only superficial burns to his hands. He was the last of 27 survivors to escape through that exit, and the last evacuee to survive the accident. Most of the bodies (38) were found clustered around the overwing exit. This exit was the first exit available to the 76 passengers seated behind it or even with it, and the nearest exit for 100 passengers.|$|R
