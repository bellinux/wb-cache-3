5|$|In 1979, Frank was {{admitted}} to the bar in Massachusetts. While in state and local government, he taught, part-time, at the University of Massachusetts Boston, the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, and at Boston University. He published numerous articles on politics and public affairs; in 1992, he published Speaking Frankly, an essay on the role the Democratic <b>Party</b> <b>should</b> play in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|On 16 August 2011, the Irish Examiner {{reported}} that Micheál Martin {{had moved to}} pull the party out of the presidential race over {{the fallout from the}} approach to Gay Byrne, the cost involved and the slim chance of a candidate being elected. On 24 August, however, the party's deputy leader Éamon Ó Cuív told Raidió na Gaeltachta that he believed the <b>party</b> <b>should</b> put forward a candidate.|$|E
5|$|On {{his arrival}} in New Zealand Stenhouse learned that nothing had been heard from Shackleton and the Weddell Sea party since their {{departure}} from South Georgia in December 1914; it seemed probable that both arms of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition were requiring relief. Stenhouse was informed by the expedition offices in London that funds had long since been exhausted and that money for the necessary work on Aurora {{would have to be}} found elsewhere. It was also evident that {{in the minds of the}} authorities the relief of Shackleton's <b>party</b> <b>should</b> have priority over the men marooned at Cape Evans.|$|E

5|$|Editor Larssen and subeditor Solbakken both {{joined the}} Communist Party in 1923 and {{continued}} running the newspaper. As Olav Larssen {{was asked by}} the party to be the acting editor of Norges Kommunistblad in the winter of 1924–1925, Fredrik Monsen, Evald Solbakken, and Knut Olai Thornæs were acting editors between 1924 and 1925. Larssen eventually drifted away from the mainstream of the Communist Party. In late 1926 and early 1927 he voiced his opinion in columns that the Communist <b>Party</b> <b>should</b> contribute to the imminent merger of the Labour Party and the Social Democratic Labour Party. A local party convention strongly rebuked this opinion. Larssen was thus replaced in January 1927 and left the Communist Party, and Solbakken soon followed suit. Fredrik Monsen left the party at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Further unrest was {{triggered}} when an Imperial slave named Stephanus was robbed while travelling near Beth-horon. Troops sent by Cumanus {{to arrest the}} leading men of the nearby villages began plundering the area. One of them, finding {{a copy of the}} Torah, destroyed it in view of the villagers while shouting blasphemies. Angered by this insult to God and to the Jewish religion, a crowd of Jews confronted Cumanus at Caesarea Maritima, demanding that the guilty <b>party</b> <b>should</b> be punished. This time the governor acted decisively and ordered that the soldier responsible should be beheaded in front of his accusers, temporarily restoring the calm.|$|E
5|$|Recognising {{that the}} {{situation}} was safer for him, Lenin returned to Petrograd. There he attended {{a meeting of the}} Bolshevik Central Committee on 10 October, where he again argued that the <b>party</b> <b>should</b> lead an armed insurrection to topple the Provisional Government. This time the argument won with ten votes against two. Critics of the plan, Zinoviev and Kamenev, argued that Russian workers would not support a violent coup against the regime {{and that there was no}} clear evidence for Lenin's assertion that all of Europe was on the verge of proletarian revolution. The party began plans to organise the offensive, holding a final meeting at the Smolny Institute on 24 October. This was the base of the Military Revolutionary Committee (MRC), an armed militia largely loyal to the Bolsheviks that had been established by the Petrograd Soviet during Kornilov's alleged coup.|$|E

5|$|Reihl-Kir and Džaja {{concluded}} that a <b>party</b> <b>should</b> be sent to Borovo Selo, and Šoškoćanin agreed to grant the police safe passage under a white flag. However, when the force of between 20 and 30 policemen entered Borovo Selo under the white flag, they were ambushed by paramilitaries and members of a local militia. Approximately 150 police arrived from Osijek and Vinkovci on buses and were deployed as reinforcements. The force dispatched from Vinkovci entered Borovo Selo and was ambushed, while the reinforcements sent from Osijek via Dalj were stopped at a roadblock north of Borovo Selo and failed to enter the village. A firefight ensued and lasted until 2:30p.m., when seven JNA armoured personnel carriers (APCs) moved into the village from Dalj. Another convoy of APCs deployed by the JNA through Borovo Naselje, just south of Borovo Selo, was stopped by a crowd of Croat women who refused to let them through.|$|E
5|$|The Duke of Wellington was {{becoming}} unpopular as Prime Minister, {{particularly in the}} industrial north west of England, for continually blocking proposed reforms. Huskisson saw himself as well placed to unite the two wings of the Tory <b>party</b> <b>should</b> the Duke retire, or to lead the reforming faction of the party into a split from the Tories and a progressive alliance with the Whigs. He also saw himself as a natural ally for the Duke, despite their political differences, as a Tory popular in Liverpool and Manchester, {{both of which were}} traditionally hostile to the party. Newspapers were already beginning to report rumours that Huskisson and his supporters were to be invited back into the government.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe {{was adopted}} as North Devon's Liberal {{candidate}} in April 1952. His political stance matched {{that of other}} young activists, who believed that the <b>party</b> <b>should</b> offer a radical non-socialist alternative to the Conservative government. He and others founded the Radical Reform Group, to drive the party in that direction. He {{spent much of his}} spare time cultivating the voters in North Devon; at rallies and on the doorstep he mixed local concerns with conspicuously liberal views on larger, international issues such as colonialism and apartheid. When Anthony Eden, who had succeeded Winston Churchill as prime minister, called a snap general election in April 1955, Thorpe fought an energetic local campaign. He succeeded in halving the Conservative majority in the constituency, and restoring the Liberals to second place.|$|E

5|$|When his {{re-election}} in 1975 seemed unsure, Kreisky proposed that his Social Democratic <b>Party</b> <b>should</b> form a coalition with the Freedom Party, headed by Friedrich Peter. Wiesenthal was {{in possession of}} information proving that Peter {{had been a member}} of the 1 SS Infantry Brigade, a unit that had exterminated over 13,000 Jewish civilians in Ukraine in 1941–42. He decided not to reveal this information to the press until after the election, but forwarded his dossier to President Rudolf Kirchschläger. Peter denied having participated in, or having knowledge of, any atrocities. In the end, Kreisky's party won a clear majority and did not form the coalition.|$|E
5|$|Bartlett's initial {{plan had}} been for the group to rest briefly on Wrangel Island and then to move on {{together}} to the Siberian coast. However, because three men—Mamen, Malloch and Maurer—were injured, and others were weak and frostbitten, Bartlett decided that the main <b>party</b> <b>should</b> remain on the island while he went for help taking only Kataktovik. The pair started off on 18 March, with seven dogs and provisions for 48 days (30 days for the dogs), and took an extended route round the island's southern shores to look for signs of Anderson's or Mackay's parties. After finding nothing, they headed across the ice towards Siberia, but progress was slow over a surface that was frequently shifting and breaking up to form leads of open water. More time was lost digging out their provisions from the steadily drifting snow. As they drew nearer to the mainland, Kataktovik became nervous; he had heard that the Alaskan Inuit were disliked in Siberia by the native Chukchi people, and feared for his life. Bartlett {{did his best to}} reassure him as they moved slowly forward.|$|E
5|$|Recognising {{that the}} {{situation}} was safer for him, Lenin returned to Petrograd via Vyborg. There, Lenin attended {{a meeting of the}} Bolshevik Central Committee on 10 October, where he again argued his case that the <b>party</b> <b>should</b> lead an armed insurrection of their supporters to topple the Provisional Government. This time, he was successful in his argument, and the motion was ratified with ten votes against two. Those critical of the plan, Zinoviev and Kamenev, expressed the view that Russian workers would not support a violent coup against the existing regime {{and that there was no}} clear evidence for Lenin's assertion that all of Europe was on the verge of proletarian revolution. The party began plans to organise the offensive, holding a final meeting at the Smolny Institute on 24 October. This was the base of the Military Revolutionary Committee (MRC), an armed militia that had been established by the Petrograd Soviet with the Provisional Government's support during the Kornilov Affair; the MRC consisted largely of those loyal to the Bolsheviks.|$|E
