50|$|Fantasyland is the park's largest land themed to classic Disney {{animated}} films. The land {{features the}} 197 ft Enchanted Storybook Castle, themed to Disney princesses. The castle {{is the largest}} in any Disney theme park, and features the Royal Banquet Hall restaurant, a boutique, and Voyage to the Crystal Grotto —a boat ride, located beneath the castle, that takes guests past scenes from films including Tangled, Aladdin, Mulan, Fantasia, The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast. Attractions include Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, Peter Pan's Flight, The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, and For the First Time in Forever: A Frozen Sing-Along Celebration. The area features unique attractions such as the Alice in Wonderland Maze—a walk-through hedge maze inspired by the 1951 and 2010 versions film adaptations—and the Hunny <b>Pot</b> <b>Spin,</b> a spinning Teacups-style ride themed to The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.|$|R
25|$|Wapishana men craft wooden stools and baskets, sieves, and squeezers {{for use in}} the {{preparation}} of cassava and other foods. They also make arrows, fencing wire into points, but these arrows and bows they buy or get hold of from other Indians have been almost entirely replaced by shotguns. Women make clay cooking <b>pots</b> and <b>spin</b> cotton and weave the thread into baby slings and hammocks. Introduced crafts include needlework, dressmaking, and rustic furniture making.|$|R
25|$|Large {{quantities}} of pure CNTs {{can be made}} into a fiber (a.k.a. filament) by wet spinning. The fiber is either directly spun from the synthesis <b>pot</b> or <b>spun</b> from pre-made dissolved CNTs. Individual fibers can be turned into a yarn. Apart from its strength and flexibility, the main advantage is making an electrically conducting yarn. The electronic properties of individual CNT fibers (i.e. bundle of individual CNT) is governed by the two-dimensional structure of CNTs.. At 300 K, CNT fibers have a conductivity one order of magnitude higher than the best electrical conductors.|$|R
50|$|Glutton {{commander}} of his Forces with {{his inability to}} make decisions. Usually relies on others to make decisions for him, and eats his stress away. Loyal to Motonari and Mitsunari, who treat him like a pawn. His weapon is a <b>pot,</b> which he <b>spins</b> on to attack. He also uses food ingredients to attack.|$|R
5|$|The Iazyges used hanging {{barrel-shaped}} pots {{that were}} asymmetrical, and had uneven weight distribution. The rope to hang the pot was {{wrapped around the}} edges of the side collar, it is believed that the rope was tied tightly to the pot, allowing the <b>pot</b> to <b>spin</b> in circles, due to the spinning motion, several theories have been made of the use of the pots. It is believed that the smaller hanging pots were used to ferment alcohol, by use of the seeds of touch-me-not balsam (Impatiens noli-tangere), and the larger hanging pots were used to churn butter and make cheese. They were cattle breeders, and as such required salt in order to preserve their meat, however, the Iazyges had no salt mines within their land. According to Dio, the Iazyges received grain from the Romans.|$|R
50|$|When {{the windows}} stopped spinning, the {{contestant}} chose {{either of the}} displayed categories, and had to fulfill the contract by correctly answering the number of questions indicated in the contract window. Each correct answer added the dollar value of the category to a pot. The bullseye represented an unlimited contract, which allowed the contestant who spun it to continue answering questions as long as he/she desired. If a contestant answered incorrectly at any point, the opponent was {{given a chance to}} take control of the contract with a right answer. An incorrect answer on a bullseye immediately ended the contract, but the opponent could still take control by giving the correct response. If both contestants missed the same question, it was thrown out and control reverted to the contestant who had originally tried to answer it. The contestant who completed the contract could choose to bank the money in the pot and give up control of the next spin to the opponent, or leave the money in the <b>pot</b> and <b>spin</b> again.|$|R
50|$|Like Top Gear of the Pops, {{the title}} screen and music is changed {{to suit the}} programme. Instead of having cars in the background, images of {{gardening}} were shown instead. The images bore a strong resemblance to the Top Gear title screen (e.g. dirt {{coming out of a}} <b>spinning</b> <b>pot,</b> similar to a car wheel spinning and kicking up water from the ground) Hammond was seen pushing a spade into the ground, and then holding it over his shoulder. May was seen holding a wheelbarrow, and breaking a gnome in half (in replacement of him pushing a button on a remote control in the Top Gear title screen). Clarkson was seen with a pair of open hedge trimmers, which he then snaps shut.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a clay {{operator}} at a jigger wheel at the Pacific Clay Products Company, {{plant number}} four, ca. 1934. At center, {{a single man}} is seen holding a large lever {{in his left hand}} while grasping a small block in his right hand. The man wears a set of dirty overalls with a tank top underneath. Also, a small beanie can be seen on his head. The man holds the lever at a slight angle, since another lever can also be seen in the upright position. The worker holds the block in his hand against the rim of the <b>pot</b> in the <b>spinning</b> piece seen at the center. Clay covers the worker's right hand. Above the worker, pieces of machinery hang overhead. In the foreground to the left, a pile of unused clay can be seen on a table beside a finished clay pot. In the extreme background, multiple shelves of pots are visible...|$|R
50|$|A corn stove is {{designed}} for whole kernel shelled corn kernel combustion and {{is similar to a}} pellet stove. The chief difference between a pellet stove and a dedicated corn stove is the addition of metal stirring rod within the burnpot or an active ash removal system. These vary in design slightly, but usually consist of one long metal stalk with smaller rods welded at a perpendicular angle, in order to churn the burn <b>pot</b> as it <b>spins.</b> An active ash removal system consists of augers {{at the bottom of the}} burn pot that evacuate the ash and clinkers. During a normal burn cycle, the sugar content within corn (and other similar bio-fuels) will cause the ashes to stick together, forming a hard mass. The metal stirring rod breaks apart these masses, causing a much more consistent burn. While there is demand to create stoves that are able to burn multiple fuels with minimal adjustments, some pellet stoves are not designed to stir fuel and cannot burn corn fuel.|$|R
50|$|The sabot {{of a large}} calibre APDS {{consists}} of a light high strength alloy full diameter pot and base unit, which is screwed together. The front part of the pot has 3-4 petals (sabots) which are covered with a centering band (often a nylon derivative). The rear half has a rubber obturator and driving band (again nylon) {{held in place by}} the screw-in base unit. The base unit, if a tracer element is attached to the sub-projectile, has a hole located at the centre. Before firing, the sub-projectile and sabot are locked together. Due to the high setback forces (g-forces), friction between the pot and sub-projectile allows spin to be transferred, thus stabilising the sub-projectile. Small/medium calibre APDS use a lightweight high strength alloy base pot and three or more plastic petals. To transfer the spin to the core in small/medium calibre weapons, the core tends to have a notch at its base. Under bore acceleration, which can be higher than 100,000 g, the uneven base is forced into the softer pot material, locking the sub-projectile to the <b>pot</b> and imparting <b>spin.</b> Not all small/medium calibre APDS rely on this technique, another method for spin coupling is by using the forward plastic petals. The petals are of a slightly larger diameter than the lands in the rifled bore. This forces the petals tightly against the core, increasing the friction between them and allowing the spin to be transferred.|$|R
