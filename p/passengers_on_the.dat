5|$|The 1996 Maryland train {{collision}} {{occurred on}} February 16, 1996, when a MARC commuter train collided with Amtrak's Capitol Limited passenger train in Silver Spring, Maryland. An {{investigation by the}} National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that {{the crew of the}} MARC train had forgotten the indication of an approach signal which they had passed before a station stop, and as a consequence could not slow down in time after encountering a stop signal. The collision killed three crew and eight <b>passengers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> MARC train; a further eleven <b>passengers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> MARC train and fifteen passengers and crew on the Capitol Limited were injured.

To accommodate additional <b>passengers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Victoria line, a new ticket hall was built.

5|$|From 3 June to 30 September 1960, Braathens SAFE {{was granted}} {{concession}} {{on the route}} from Oslo via Sandefjord Airport, Torp to Aalborg Airport in Denmark. This became possible because SAS had abandoned the route the previous year. It was flown with a DC-3, giving an 80% load factor. On 22 July, the Braathens SAFE applied for a three-year concession, but this was rejected because SAS stated that they would restart the route. In 1961, SAS started the route Stavanger–Kristiansand–Ålborg, and in 1963 on the route Oslo–Kristiansand–Ålborg. The concession allowed SAS to also take <b>passengers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> domestic legs, giving Braathens SAFE competition on the routes to Kristiansand.|$|E

5|$|On 25 September 1905, {{following}} lobbying by Ickenham Parish Council, the Metropolitan Railway {{opened a}} small halt on their line between Harrow and Uxbridge. The railway {{company had been}} reluctant to open a station in the area due to a perceived lack of demand, and so a compromise was reached {{with the construction of}} the halt. The new stop brought with it travellers from London seeking a day out in rural surroundings. Nearby villagers sold flowers from their gardens and served teas to the visitors. The parish council later requested shelters for <b>passengers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> platforms, which were built in December 1905, followed by a booking hut in 1910. The original platforms, too short to align with all train carriages, were extended in 1922. Ickenham Halt was rebuilt as a station in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The Burys {{travelled}} {{north as}} second-class <b>passengers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> steamer Cambria.

The Burys stayed for only eight days before they moved on 29 January to a squat at 113 Prince's Street, a basement flat under a shop. William had obtained the key under false pretences by telling the letting agents that he was a viewer interested in renting the property. Meanwhile, Ellen found a job as a cleaner at a local mill, but she quit after a day. William continued to drink heavily, often with a decorator called David Walker, who was re-painting the public house frequented by William.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{extension}} of the railway was completed in 1976, work in the vicinity continued with the creation of footpaths connecting to the new station. A new footbridge was built crossing the Nant Gwernol gorge and connecting the station with the existing path {{on the east side of}} the river. The bridge and paths were opened on 3 May 1980 by Lord Parry, the chairman of the Wales Tourist Board. By the mid-1970s, it had become clear that passenger numbers were no longer increasing. After 1973, the peak year for <b>passengers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Talyllyn with 186,000passenger journeys made, numbers were to decline consistently until the 1990s.
