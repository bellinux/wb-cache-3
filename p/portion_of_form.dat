40|$|Extract] The {{results from}} New Zealand's {{participation}} in the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) have revealed the disturbing level of science achievement by New Zealand Form 2 and Form 3 students and associated concerns with science programme delivery in general. An evaluation of the teachers who participated in TIMSS suggests that a disturbing <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Form</b> 2 teachers (and primary teachers in general) expressed a {{lack of confidence in}} their ability to teach science as a consequence of limited formal science learning experiences. This final report of a three part series examines the biographical details, in the context of the teaching of science, of the 122 primary/intermediate/Kura Kaupapa Maori teachers in the Central Districts of the North Island of New Zealand who participated in a study attempting to identify the factors teachers perceived to be influencing the effective implementation of Science in the New Zealand Curriculum...|$|E

30|$|Micelles are self-assembled {{nanostructures}} with a hydrophobic {{core and}} hydrophilic shell which are spontaneously formed above a certain concentration (critical micellar concentration). They can be constituted from lipid-based or polymer-based amphiphilic molecules [13]. Micellar formulations, including polymer micelles, have been extensively studied as molecular delivery systems [86]. In general, the hydrophobic <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the polymer <b>forms</b> a semisolid core, while the hydrophilic <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> polymer <b>forms</b> the corona. The hydrophobic core promotes stability, while the hydrophilic shell increases solubility, prevents opsonization, and reduces RES uptake. Molecules can be physically trapped into the hydrophobic core {{or can be}} covalently bound with components of the corona [87].|$|R
