5000|$|The {{design and}} {{construction}} {{took place at the}} ex-GWR Swindon Works, along with the 2-6-0 tender engine version of the class.Although the boiler shared flanged plates with the GWR No.2 boiler the barrel was shortened by [...] inches and a dome added. Strangely they did not share the same design of wheels as the Doncaster-designed BR Standard Class 4 2-6-0 (76XXX), which also had 5 ft driving wheels and the same <b>piston</b> <b>stoke,</b> and hence crank-pin throw.|$|E

50|$|Three days later, {{after an}} opening-round playoff {{game against the}} Detroit <b>Pistons,</b> <b>Stokes</b> became ill during the team's flight back to Cincinnati, {{suffered}} a seizure and fell into a coma to awaken in a Cincinnati hospital three weeks later. Stokes never fully recovered from the brain injury, and he was left permanently paralyzed. He would be confined to bed or a wheelchair as an almost completely paralyzed quadraplegic, and would need constant nursing care.|$|R
50|$|Lovellette was {{fourth in}} the NBA in scoring, while Twyman led the NBA in {{shooting}} accuracy. The entire frontline of Stokes, Lovellette and Twyman were named NBA All-Stars that first season. The team had {{the makings of a}} real contender, but the backcourt was debilitated by injuries to Marhsall and King, plus promising Si Green and Johnny McCarthy had been lost to mandatory military service. The team's first-year promise took a tragic turn in mid-March. In the final game of the regular season, played on March 12, Stokes suffered an injury when his head hit the hardwood floor in a game versus the Minneapolis Lakers. Despite being knocked unconscious, Stokes would play in the playoffs against the Detroit Pistons. On the flight home after losing to the <b>Pistons,</b> <b>Stokes</b> suddenly fell ill and {{was rushed to the hospital}} upon landing. As the Pistons swept the Royals, Stokes lapsed into a coma. It was revealed that Stokes suffered encephalopathy, a traumatic brain injury that damaged his motor control center. The injury would leave Maurice Stokes as a quadriplegic without the ability to speak. Teammate Jack Twyman would serve as Stokes legal guardian until his death in 1970.The Stokes tragedy would ultimately decimate the team, with six other players not returning for next season. The team was also suddenly sold to local Cincinnati buyers, and coach Bobby Wanzer would also later be replaced. This first year, therefore, stands out from all the Cincinnati teams.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} results of a {{relatively}} new computational fluid dynamics method, cellular automatons, with experimental data and analytical results. This technique has been shown to qualitatively predict fluid-like behavior, however, there have been few published comparisons with experiment or other theories. Comparisons are made for a one-dimensional supersonic <b>piston</b> problem, <b>Stokes</b> First Problem, and the flow past a normal flat plate. These comparisons are used to assess the ability of the method to accurately model fluid dynamic behavior and to point out its limitations. Reasonable results were obtained for all three test cases. While this is encouraging, the fundamental limitations of cellular automatons are numerous. In addition, i t may be misleading, at this tine, to say that cellular automat. ons are a computationally efficient technique. Other methods, based on continuum or kinetic theory, would also be very efficient if a? little of the physics were included. ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1900 the American Bicycle Co. of Toledo, Ohio {{created a}} 6.25 hp Toledo Steam Carriage (a {{description}} from the Horseless Age, December 1900). The American Bicycle Co {{was one of}} the enterprises within Col. Albert Pope's large conglomerate of bicycle and motor vehicles manufacturers. The Toledo Steam Carriage was a very well-made, high-quality machine where every component, bar the tires, bell, instruments and lights were made within the dedicated 245,000 sq ft factory in Toledo, Ohio. The Toledo is considered {{to be one of the}} best steam cars produced at the time. The engine was particularly robust and the 2, 3" [...] diameter x 4" [...] <b>stoke</b> <b>pistons</b> employed piston style valves instead of 'D' valves thus insuring better balance and reduced leakage of steam. In September 1901 two Toledo steamers, one model B (a model A machine 1000 to 2000 lb but with the foul-weather gear designating it as a model B) and one class E (public delivery vehicle), were entered by the American Bicycle Co. into the New York to Buffalo Endurance Contest of mid-September 1901. There were 36 cars in class B and three in class E; the class B Toledo won the Grosse Point race. on 4 January 1902 a specially built Toledo steam carriage was the first automobile to forge a trail from Flagstaff, Arizona to the South Rim of The Grand Canyon, a distance of 67 miles. As a publicity exercise the trip was to assess the potential of starting a steam bus service but the anticipated afternoon journey took three days due to problems with supplies of the wrong fuel. Though the Toledo towed a trailer filled with additional water and fuel supplies the four participants omitted to take any food; one, the journalist Winfield Hoggaboon wrote up an amusing article in the Los Angeles Herald two weeks later. The previous December, on the 19th 1901 the company changed from the American Bicycle Company to the newly formed International Motor Car Company to concentrate on steam and gasoline driven models with electric vehicles being made by the separate Waverly Electric Co. Both steam and gasoline models were manufactured but as the public favoured the gasoline models and steam carriage sales were slow steam carriage production ceased in July 1902 and gasoline-driven models were then made under the name Pope-Toledo. Total production of the steamers was between 285 and 325 units, as confirmed by a letter from the International Motor Car Co book keeper to the firms' accountant in June 1902.|$|R
