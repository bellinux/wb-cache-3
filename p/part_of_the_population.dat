5|$|T. m. syriacus breeds on the Mediterranean {{coast of}} {{southern}} Turkey south to Jordan, Israel {{and the northern}} Sinai. It is mostly resident, but <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> moves south west or west to winter in the Jordan Valley and in the Nile Delta of northern Egypt south to about Cairo. Both sexes of this subspecies are darker and greyer than the equivalent merula plumages.|$|E
5|$|A large <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> of the Northern states {{believed}} that the Davis government was somehow involved in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and {{although there was no}} evidence of their complicity, it was a political reality that had to be dealt with. One result was that the political radicals were able to force the government to prosecute those who had led the war against the Union. Mallory was one of the Confederate leaders who were charged with treason, among other things; on May 20, 1865, while he was still at La Grange, he was roused from his sleep at about midnight and taken into custody. From there he was taken to Fort Lafayette in New York Harbor, where he was confined as a political prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Patras, on {{the northwestern}} {{coast of the}} Peloponnese, is claimed by the Chronicle of Monemvasia—a work of highly disputed {{accuracy}} and chronology, but an essential source for the period—to {{have been one of}} the cities abandoned c. 587/8 as a result of the Slavic depredations, its population fleeing to Rhegion in Calabria. This was followed by 218 years of independent Slavic rule in the Peloponnese, until around 804/5. The archaeological record on the other hand shows Patras to have remained in Byzantine control throughout the period, although it is possible that <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> indeed emigrated to Italy.|$|E

5|$|West Bengal is religiously diverse, with {{regional}} {{cultural and religious}} specificities. Although Hindus are the predominant community, {{the state has a}} large minority Muslim population. Christians, Buddhists, and others form a minuscule <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population.</b> As of 2011, Hinduism is the largest religion, with adherents representing 70.54% of the total population, while Muslims comprise 27.01% of the total population, being the second-largest community as well as the largest minority group. Sikhism, Christianity, Buddhism, and other religions make up the remainder. Buddhism remains a prominent religion in the Himalayan region of the Darjeeling hills, and almost the entirety of West Bengal's Buddhist population are from this region.|$|E
5|$|In Canada, the Supreme Court held in Sauvé v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer) (2002), that a {{statutory}} provision prohibiting prisoners serving {{a sentence of}} two years or more from voting unjustifiably infringed the fundamental right to vote guaranteed by section 3 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Court noted that the Government could not demonstrate how denying prisoners the vote helped the stated aims of the relevant statute; a democracy built on inclusiveness, democracy and citizen participation cannot be party to a law that disenfranchises a considerable <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population.</b> There was also no credible theory why prisoners should be {{denied the right to}} vote as a form of punishment, as it is arbitrary and not related to the offender's criminal act nor does it deter crime or rehabilitate criminals.|$|E
5|$|In {{the past}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> worked in coal mining, {{although}} there are no working mines in the area now. There is still a fairly large agricultural workforce and in light industry or service industries, although many people commute to surrounding cities for work. According to the 2011 Census the valley has a population of approximately 5,000, largely living in one of the dozen or so villages and in isolated farms and hamlets. The average age of the population is 42 years, with unemployment rates of 1–4% of all economically active people aged 16–74, however these figures are approximations because the ward areas covered and described in the census statistics do not relate exactly to the area of the valley. In the Indices of deprivation 2010 all of the areas within the valley were considered to be in the most affluent third in England.|$|E
50|$|Indian {{newspapers}} have published reports about Shyamsundarpur village; where a large <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population,</b> including children, use Sanskrit {{as a native}} language in everyday communication.|$|R
25|$|The {{circumstances}} surrounding <b>the</b> massacre <b>of</b> Thessalonica in 390 suggest {{that even in}} the late 4th century male-male sex was still accepted in large <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population,</b> while officially prosecuted.|$|R
50|$|The Jats are one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larger {{communities}} {{found in}} the Azad Kashmir, making up <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> Mirpur District, and forming a large <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> Kotli and Bhimber districts.|$|R
5|$|These {{outcomes}} of evolution are distinguished based on time scale as macroevolution versus microevolution. Macroevolution refers to evolution that occurs {{at or above}} the level of species, in particular speciation and extinction; whereas microevolution refers to smaller evolutionary changes within a species or population, in particular shifts in gene frequency and adaptation. In general, macroevolution is regarded as the outcome of long periods of microevolution. Thus, the distinction between micro- and macroevolution is not a fundamental one—the difference is simply the time involved. However, in macroevolution, the traits of the entire species may be important. For instance, a large amount of variation among individuals allows a species to rapidly adapt to new habitats, lessening the chance of it going extinct, while a wide geographic range increases the chance of speciation, by making it more likely that <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> will become isolated. In this sense, microevolution and macroevolution might involve selection at different levels—with microevolution acting on genes and organisms, versus macroevolutionary processes such as species selection acting on entire species and affecting their rates of speciation and extinction.|$|E
5|$|The Greater Montreal Area is {{predominantly}} Roman Catholic; however, weekly attendance in Quebec {{is among the}} lowest in Canada. Historically Montreal has been a centre of Catholicism in North America with its numerous seminaries and churches, including the Notre-Dame Basilica, the Cathédrale Marie-Reine-du-Monde, and Saint Joseph's Oratory. Some 65.8% {{of the total population}} is Christian, largely Roman Catholic (52.8%), primarily because of descendants of original French settlers, and others of Italian and Irish origins. Protestants which include Anglican Church in Canada, United Church of Canada, Lutheran, owing to British and German immigration, and other denominations number 5.90%, with a further 3.7% consisting mostly of Orthodox Christians, fuelled by a large Greek population. There is also a number of Russian and Ukrainian Orthodox parishes. Islam is the largest non-Christian religious group, with 154,540 members, the second-largest concentration of Muslims in Canada at 9.6%. The Jewish community in Montreal has a population of 90,780. In cities such as Côte Saint-Luc and Hampstead, Jewish people constitute the majority, or a substantial <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population.</b> As recently as 1971 the Jewish community in Greater Montreal was as high as 109,480. Political and economic uncertainties led many to leave Montreal and the province of Quebec.|$|E

50|$|In some cases, <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{national}} myth {{may become}} disputed among different <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population,</b> such as majority and minority groups, which makes branding and advertising <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national myth necessary.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> {{exclusion}} <b>of</b> large <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> from <b>the</b> citizen body {{is closely}} related to <b>the</b> ancient understanding <b>of</b> citizenship.

50|$|Astoria {{attracted}} {{a host of}} immigrants {{beginning in the late}} 19th century: Nordic settlers, primarily Finns, and Chinese soon became larger <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population.</b> <b>The</b> Finns mostly lived in Uniontown, near <b>the</b> present-day end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Astoria-Megler Bridge, and took fishing jobs; the Chinese tended to do cannery work, and usually lived either downtown or in bunkhouses near the canneries. By the late 1800s, 22% of Astoria's population was Chinese.|$|R
