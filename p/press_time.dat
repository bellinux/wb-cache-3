5|$|The liner {{had several}} mishaps during her {{passenger}} career. On 2 March 1903, {{an article in}} The Washington Post reported that Merion had run aground shortly after leaving Queenstown while en route to Liverpool from Boston. The ship was freed from her perch near Chicago Knoll by the rising tide, but when she got underway again became stuck fast in almost the same spot. At <b>press</b> <b>time,</b> two British Admiralty tugs had been dispatched to free the ship. Almost exactly a year later, Merion collided with the steamer Clan Grant off Tuskar Rock on 30 March 1904 and was damaged. On 24 December 1912, Merion collided with a tanker off the Delaware coast and sustained damage which included two flooded compartments. The ship was beached below Cross Ledge, but was refloated and made way under her own power back to Philadelphia, after discharging her cargo and passengers.|$|E
25|$|Process indices {{examine how}} {{individuals}} process information in their environment, such as by analyzing communication patterns between team members or using eye tracking devices. Team communication (particularly verbal communication) supports the knowledge building and information processing {{that leads to}} SA construction (Endsley & Jones, 1997). Thus, since SA may be distributed via communication, computational linguistics and machine learning techniques can be combined with natural language analytical techniques (e.g., Latent Semantic Analysis) to create models that draw on the verbal expressions of the team to predict SA and task performance (Bolstad, Cuevas, Gonzalez, & Schneider, 2005; Bolstad, Foltz, Franzke, Cuevas, Rosenstein, & Costello, 2007). Although evidence exists to support the utility of communication analysis for predicting team SA (Foltz, Bolstad, Cuevas, Franzke, Rosenstein, & Costello, in <b>press),</b> <b>time</b> constraints and technological limitations (e.g., cost and availability of speech recording systems and speech-to-text translation software) may make this approach less practical and viable in time-pressured, fast-paced operations.|$|E

Before the show, Madonna {{expressed concern about the}} physical and time constraints of the event. [...] "I have eight minutes to set up my stage, 12 minutes to put on the greatest show on Earth, and I have seven minutes to take it down. So, that football field is clean for {{the second half of the}} game", she said. [...] "How do you do that? This is a Midwesterner girls dream to be performing at the Super Bowl half-time show. In over 25 years of performing that I've done, I have never worked so hard or been so scrupulous or detail-orientated or freaked out." [...] The singer's plan to have 100 drummers descend from the stadium ceiling was cancelled, since the structure could not support the weight.|$|E

500|$|Little {{is known}} about West Cohass {{subsequent}} civilian career until 1925. On 20 July, The Washington Post carried a news report that West Cohas had run aground on shoals off Sable Island. The French fishing trawler Labrador had run aground on the shoals {{on the morning of}} 19 July and had issued a distress call. The nearby West Cohas steamed to her aid, but became stranded on the rocks nearby and issued her own distress call. Lifesaving crews had been dispatched but could reach neither ship because of fog and waves. At <b>press</b> <b>time</b> the Canadian government buoy tender and several tugs were reported on their way [...] to aid both ships. There were no follow up reports to indicate how much damage West Cohas sustained, but she escaped the fate of the [...] Labrador, which was a total loss. West Cohas had been repaired and was back in service by November 1926, when The Wall Street Journal reported that she was to begin service carrying grain from Galveston, Texas, to London.|$|E
500|$|The Tales of the Black Freighter DVD also {{includes}} Under the Hood, a fictional in-universe documentary detailing the characters' backstories, which takes its title {{from that of}} Hollis Mason's memoirs in the comic book.

50|$|Urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins are dominantly used in {{the medium}} density {{fiberboard}} (MDF) industry because of their low cost and fast curing characteristics. However, pressures {{on the use of}} UF resins are mounting steadily due to potential problems associated with formaldehyde emission. On the other hand, phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resins are more durable and do not emit formaldehyde after cure. The industry has traditionally shied away from using PF resins due primarily to their higher cost and much slower curing rate than UF resins. However, the <b>press</b> <b>times</b> for PF-bonded fiberboard can be substantially reduced by manipulating the fiber mat temperatures, molecular weight distribution of PF resins and pressing parameters. As a result, the <b>press</b> <b>times</b> for PF-bonded fiberboard can be made comparable to those for UF-bonded fiberboard. Also, the resin content required for PF-bonded fiberboard is less than 5% to achieve a good board quickly. This is considerably lower than that required for UF-bonded fiberboard.|$|R
