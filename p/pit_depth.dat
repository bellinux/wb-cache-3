50|$|<b>Pit</b> <b>depth</b> modulation, {{which the}} company later branded MultiLevel Recording (ML), {{is one of many}} {{techniques}} to increase recording densities on conventional CD-optical media. Calimetrics' implementation of <b>pit</b> <b>depth</b> modulation, using modified CD drive electronics but no changes to the pickup-head, increased the quantity of distinguishable recording-marks from 2-levels (used by EFM in CD) to 8 levels. The increase in bit-density had a side benefit of increasing data-transfer rate (at the same rotational-velocity of the disc.) MultiLevel, like most of the other strategies proposed for extending CD capacity, was not backward compatible with CD-ROM technology: 2GB ML R, RW, and ROM disc playing and recording required ML-capable writers and special ML-CD compatible media. However, the cost to build CD rewriters with both ML and CD support was less than that of DVD-recordable technology.|$|E

40|$|Direct {{measurement}} of optical phase {{is used in}} a high-density optical disk reader. The increased density is achieved by introducing multiple <b>pit</b> <b>depths</b> to replace the single <b>pit</b> <b>depths</b> of a traditional compact disk. Having four independent <b>pit</b> <b>depths</b> can double the storage capacity of a disk. The multi-level pits are read by direct {{measurement of}} the phase difference between two laser spots focused onto the disk surface. Extraction of phase information utilizes the equations of phase shifting interferometry with four shifted fringe patterns created simultaneously by a compact optical head. The system speed is therefore limited by the readout electronics instead of by slow mechanical phase shifters. The resulting system can identify four independent levels {{as well as the}} direction of transition from one level to another.

50|$|When a laser is used {{to record}} on the dye-polymer used in non-photoresist (NPR) mastering, the dye-polymer absorbs laser energy focused in a precise spot; this vapourises and forms a pit in {{the surface of the}} dye-polymer. This pit can be scanned by a red laser beam that follows the cutting beam, {{and the quality of the}} {{recording}} can be directly and immediately assessed; for instance, audio signals being recorded can also be played straight from the glass master in real time. The pit geometry and quality of the playback can all be adjusted while the CD is being mastered, as the blue writing laser and the red read laser are typically connected via a feedback system to optimise the recording. This allows the dye-polymer LBR to produce very consistent pits even if there are variations in the dye-polymer layer. Another advantage of this method is that <b>pit</b> <b>depth</b> variation can be programmed during recording to compensate for downstream characteristics of the local production process (e.g., marginal molding performance). This cannot be done with photoresist mastering because the <b>pit</b> <b>depth</b> is set by the PR coating thickness, whereas dye-polymer pits are cut into a coating thicker than the intended pits.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{some aspects}} ofthe {{processes involved in}} the development of high-quality probabilistic models for corrosion loss and for maximum <b>pit</b> <b>depth</b> for steels exposed to marine environments. Such models increasingly are required for advanced infrastructure life-cycle management to predict likely future levels of deterioration and for the setting of rational inspection regimes. Most models currently available are empirical. They have high levels of uncertainty. The models described herein are based on appropriate levels of representation of underlying corrosion science fundamentals, including the recognition of the important role of microbiological activity and model calibration using a probabilistic approach to data interpretation. This requires careful interpretation of existing literature data and has required obtaining new data to elucidate particular aspects. A brief overview of this work is given with emphasis on the modeling of maximum <b>pit</b> <b>depth</b> using extreme value distributions. Reinterpretation of existing <b>pit</b> <b>depth</b> data was found to be necessary for consistency with new observations of <b>pit</b> <b>depth</b> development in actual in-situ tests (as distinct from laboratory observations). As a result, the new model provides maximum <b>pit</b> <b>depth</b> as a function of time based on understanding of the underlying pitting process with time. It has shown also that long-term <b>pit</b> <b>depth</b> is most appropriately represented by the Frechet extreme value distribution since {{this is consistent with the}} underlying corrosion and bacterial processes. This new interpretation of data provides estimates of <b>pit</b> <b>depth</b> uncertainty as a function of exposure time. It is shown that this can be applied even for existing data sources that were not designed to elucidate probabilistic estimates of uncertainty.

40|$|Maximum <b>pit</b> <b>depth</b> is {{a matter}} of {{considerable}} practical interest. In applied corrosion mechanics it is conventional to represent it by an extreme value distribution, usually Gumbel. However. a detailed examination of recent field data for maximum <b>pit</b> <b>depth</b> of mild steel under marine conditions shows that it can befitted as well or better to a bi-modal probability distribution. similar to that which is typical for the underlying <b>pit</b> <b>depth</b> distribution. A reexamination of some classical maximum <b>pit</b> <b>depth</b> data extracted from the literature for aluminum and stainless steel shows a similar phenomenon. Theoretical arguments suggest one {{reason for this is that}} the coupon size typically used may be insufficient to capture the extremes. Also. on the basis of modem understanding of the pitting phenomenon. it is proposed that the formation of pits of maximum depth is consistent only with pits that initiate immediately upon exposure and then experience stable pitting behavior. Pits that undergo metastable pitting are unlikely to become extreme and constitute a different statistical population. Moreover. the depths of maximal pits are likely to be highly dependent.

Both microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) and under deposit corrosion (UDC) are suspected. A pilot study is reported herein to investigate the contributing factors {{for the formation of}} channelling corrosion. This was conducted by exposing half-pipe steel pipelines to different WIP environments. The effect of the presence of deposits, filtration and UV irradiation and nitrate addition were considered. The steel specimens were recovered after 12 days, 180 days and 365 days of exposure.

Prediction of the life time and the maximum <b>pit</b> <b>depth</b> which causes failure can help to reduce the cost of water system maintenance.

It is further known that crack width and cover depth {{play an important role in}} corrosion of the steel reinforcing (Bashir et al. 2017; Soltani et al. 2013). However, what is unknown is the effect of crack spacing and whether an optimum range of crack spacing can be found that will limit the corrosion rate. Therefore it is the aim here to investigate the effect of crack spacing on chloride-induced corrosion of R/SHCC. This research paper presents the test program and results of accelerated chloride-induced corrosion of pre-cracked R/SHCC specimens with three levels of cover depths, and one level of steel bar reinforcement.
