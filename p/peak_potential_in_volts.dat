A direct connection is {{made between the}} <b>peak</b> <b>potentials</b> observed <b>in</b> voltammograms and the electronic structure of solvated particles. Two major contributions to the voltammogram extracted electronic structure properties are established to be the quantization of electron kinetic levels (epsilon(T)) and the single electron charging cost (U), both of which display a significant variation with nanoparticle dimensionality. The dimensional dependences of these energetics {{is reflected in the}} spacings between voltammetric current peaks. The simultaneous role played by U (typically associated with Coulomb blockade) and epsilon(T) at all dimensions advances our understanding of their relative contributions in the so-called molecular redox charging regime and the nanoparticle charging regime. These general physical properties are investigated in a model solvated "particle-in-a-box" system, consisting of finite length armchair semiconducting carbon nanotubes. While implemented within a model system, the physics underlying these energetics are expected to be general to all solvated species. However, the scan rate dependence of the <b>peak</b> <b>potentials</b> <b>in</b> voltammetry under a considerable reorganization energy (lambda) complicates direct correlations between redox-active energetics and peak spacing features. We argue that this scan rate dependence can be resolved by ultrafast voltammetry.
