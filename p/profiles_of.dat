5|$|Metagenomics allows {{researchers}} {{to access the}} functional and metabolic diversity of microbial communities, but it cannot show which of these processes are active. The extraction and analysis of metagenomic mRNA (the metatranscriptome) provides information on the regulation and expression <b>profiles</b> <b>of</b> complex communities. Because of the technical difficulties (the short half-life of mRNA, for example) {{in the collection of}} environmental RNA there have been relatively few in situ metatranscriptomic studies of microbial communities to date. While originally limited to microarray technology, metatranscriptomcs studies have made use of transcriptomics technologies to measure whole-genome expression and quantification of a microbial community, first employed in analysis of ammonia oxidation in soils.|$|E

50|$|Anger {{expression}} {{can take}} on many more styles than passive or aggressive. Ephrem Fernandez has identified six bipolar dimensions of anger expression. They relate to the direction of anger, its locus, reaction, modality, impulsivity, and objective. Coordinates {{on each of these}} dimensions can be connected to generate a <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> a person's anger expression style. Among the many profiles that are theoretically possible in this system, are the familiar <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> the person with explosive anger, <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> the person with repressive anger, <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> the passive aggressive person, and the <b>profile</b> <b>of</b> constructive anger expression.|$|R

With mass applause from the Arab world, financial donations increased significantly, and Fatah's weaponry and equipment improved.

Firstly, the international and national ETD and distance education contexts are described for the purpose of benchmarking, and thereafter the TSA context is described and aligned to the bench-marks.
