50|$|The Statnamic {{load test}} {{is a type}} of test for {{assessing}} the load carrying capacity of deep foundations which is faster and less expensive than the static load test. The Statnamic test was conceived in 1985, with the first <b>prototype</b> <b>tests</b> carried out in 1988 through collaboration between Berminghammer Foundation Equipment of Canada and TNO Building Research of the Netherlands (Middendorp et al., 1992 & Middendorp, 2000).

50|$|The International Maritime Organisation, London amended SOLAS (Safety of Life at Sea) {{regulations}} with {{effect from}} 1st July 1986 with far reaching consequences as it introduced new rules for use of Lifeboats on ships particularly Oil and Gas Carriers etc., which {{proved to be a}} turning point. Successfully indigenously designed and manufactured the 8 mtr 50 Persons capacity FRP Totally Enclosed Fire Protected Lifeboat after conducting all the <b>prototype</b> <b>tests</b> including the most severe fire test in the very first attempt achieved by only a few Lifeboat builders globally. For this purpose, the Lifeboat was placed in a specially erected concrete tank located in the outskirts of Chennai with no human habitation, filled with 3,400 ltrs of kerosene and petrol and burned for a continuous period of 14 minutes with a couple of mice kept inside the boat (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVW6ahdg7A8). Received the coveted National Award for Indigenous Design and Development from Govt. of India on 14th Dec 1992. Have supplied more than 500 FRP Boats including various types of Lifeboats, fast, slow Rescue Boats, high speed Interceptor Crafts, Passenger Launches, Mooring Launches, On-Load Release Gears and Davits (Launching Appliances). Significant among them being the supply of 8 nos high speed FRP Interceptor Crafts fitted with 120 BHP Simpson P6 354 Marine Diesel Engines to the Indian Coast Guard in Sept 1988 certified by the Indian Register of Shipping for patrolling off the Rameshwaram Coast in Southern India and the 11 mtr 25 Passenger capacity high speed FRP Launch fitted with twin 200 BHP Volvo Penta Marine Diesel Engines for inter island services in Andaman & Nicobar in Feb 1997 complying with the stringent Dynamically Supported Craft regulations and certified as a Passenger Vessel by Ministry of Shipping, Govt. of India (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=585g8uVYj1c).|$|E

40|$|A {{portable}} automatic fish {{tracking system}} {{was developed for}} monitoring the two dimensional movements of small fish within fixed areas of estuarine waters and lakes. By using the miniature pinger previously developed for this application, <b>prototype</b> <b>tests</b> of the system were conducted in the York River near the Virginia Institute of Marine Science with two underwater listening stations. Results from these tests showed that the tracking system could position the miniature pinger signals to within + or - 2. 5 deg and + or - 135 m at ranges up to 2. 5 km. The pingers were implanted in small fish and were successfully tracked at comparable ranges. No changes in either fish behavior or pinger performance were observed {{as a result of}} the implantation. Based on results from these <b>prototype</b> <b>tests,</b> it is concluded that the now commercially available system provides an effective approach to underwater tracking of small fish within a fixed area of interest...|$|E

40|$|Up to 30 % {{of young}} people drink at risky levels at least weekly. Yet, many do not view their alcohol use as {{problematic}} and focus only on its enjoyment and socialization benefits. Innovative, youth-friendly and highly accessible ways of delivering preventative health messages are required. This paper describes the design, development and <b>prototype</b> <b>testing</b> of ‘Ray’s Night Out’ a new iPhone application for promoting harm minimisation and controlled drinking strategies in young people. Two participatory design workshops were conducted with 5 young people to explore how technology {{could be used to}} enhance a good night out drinking.

Final <b>prototype</b> <b>testing</b> was conducted with 10 young people. <b>Prototype</b> <b>testing</b> indicated young people had a very positive response to the Ray animated character and rated the app highly on aesthetics, engagement, content, functionality, usefulness and youth relevance. The Ray app provides a youth friendly approach to addressing alcohol misuse in young people.
