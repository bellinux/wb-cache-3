Dan assigns missions to players, occasionally commenting on their performance. The game is set on a space station—the titular Silicon Valley, which consists of four environments: Euro Eden, Arctic Kingdom, Jungle Safari, and Desert Adventure. The environments are unlocked as players <b>progress</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> game. Each environment consists of numerous sub-levels, ranging from six to ten, each of which task players with certain objectives; examples include activating switches, disabling electric fences, and gathering a set amount of objects. As players <b>progress</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> levels, they collect the scattered remains of Evo's protective shell suit, eventually re-assembling them for the final level. Each level also contains a hidden objective, such as collecting a souvenir or making an animal perform a certain act; as players complete the hidden objectives, they are rewarded with a gold trophy, and collecting all trophies unlocks a bonus level.|$|E

Kohlberg has responded by saying that although different cultures do indeed inculcate different beliefs, his stages correspond to underlying modes of reasoning, rather than to those beliefs.|$|E

5|$|A second {{competing}} {{theory for}} extratropical cyclone development over the oceans is the Shapiro-Keyser model, developed in 1990. Its main {{differences with the}} Norwegian Cyclone Model are the fracture of the cold front, treating warm-type occlusions and warm fronts as the same, and allowing the cold front to <b>progress</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> warm sector perpendicular to the warm front. This model was based on oceanic cyclones and their frontal structure, as seen in surface observations and in previous projects which used aircraft to determine the vertical structure of fronts across the northwest Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|Enzymes {{determine}} what steps occur in these pathways. Without enzymes, metabolism would neither <b>progress</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> same steps {{and could not}} be regulated to serve the needs of the cell. Most central metabolic pathways are regulated at a few key steps, typically through enzymes whose activity involves the hydrolysis of ATP. Because this reaction releases so much energy, other reactions that are thermodynamically unfavorable can be coupled to ATP hydrolysis, driving the overall series of linked metabolic reactions.|$|E
