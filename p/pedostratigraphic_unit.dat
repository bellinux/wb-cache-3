40|$|The Berino paleosol is {{the first}} record of a {{directly}} dated Aridisol in the American Southwest where paleoclimatic conditions {{during the time of}} pedogenesis can be estimated. The noncalcic, argillic paleosol formed in eolian sand during the cool, wet climate of the mid- and late Wisconsin, marine isotope stages 3 and 2, in presently semiarid southeastern New Mexico. Optically stimulated luminescence dating of the Mescalero sand sheet and the Berino indicates that soil formation occurred during the period 50 – 18 ka. The paleosol is a red 2. 5 YR hue Bt horizon, 120 cm thick, with 25 % clay, 0. 36 % Fe, and an absence of visible carbonate. It is buried by younger eolian sand, although {{at the edges of the}} sand sheet, it is unburied and a relict soil. Red argillic paleosols in other sand sheets in the region may correlate with the Berino. The Berino paleosol is formally named as a <b>pedostratigraphic</b> <b>unit...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{properties}} of seven ferruginous paleosols, formed in alluvial continental deposits of Upper Cretaceous- Paleocene age in central-southern Sardinia (Italy), were examined {{to understand their}} genesis. Particular attention has been addressed to their paleoenvironmental and paleogeographic significance, also in comparison with similar paleosols in southern France, and to their potential to represent good pedostratigraphic markers for a larger area. The paleosols are characterized by petroplinthic, pisoplinthic, plinthic or pisolithic horizons. Their genesis started under a warm and humid tropical climate, with distinct wet and dry seasons, of the Latest Maastrichtian-Lower Paleocene and continued, under increasingly dry conditions, during the Middle to Upper Paleocene. The major differences that occur among the paleosols {{can be related to}} differences in geomorphic position, parent material characteristics and drainage conditions. The pisolithic paleosols of central-southern Sardinia show a structure and composition comparable to those of the coeval ones in southern France, which were formed under similar climatic conditions. On the basis of the constant stratigraphic position, the large geographic extent and the supposed former lateral continuity, the studied ferruginous paleosols can be considered to be a good pedostratigraphic marker in central-southern Sardinia and in southern France and are informally named as the “Monte Maraconis geosol”. This allows extensive chronostratigraphic correlations as well as regional-scale morphostratigraphic correlations and represents, with its typical pedofacies, a <b>pedostratigraphic</b> <b>unit</b> worthy of consideration in future regional geological mapping...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{stable isotope}} {{analyses}} of worldwide reference curves, {{it has long}} been apparent that duration, intensity and climatic conditions of Pleistocene interglacial periods were significantly diverse. As a consequence of negligible fresh, detrital material admixture during interglacials, the soil formation intensity and maturity of various kinds of past soils have been holding vital information on the environmental conditions at the time the soils formed. This, in turn, means that several physicochemical properties of soils allow us to reconstruct past climatic regimes. Loess-paleosol sequences in Hungary (Central Europe) provide insight into the cyclic nature of glacial-interglacial variations of the last 1 million years. The paleosoils have been recognized as the product of warmer and moister interglacials, when the (glacial) loess material was altered by chemical weathering and pedogenic processes. The gradual change from oldest red Mediterranean soils via forest and forest-steppe soils to steppe soils represents well the continuous decrease of chemical alteration of interglacial paleosoils determined by environmental factors and duration of soil formation. Pedogene units from MIS- 21 to MIS- 5 strata were analysed {{in the course of this}} study. Major element analyses were carried out to get a proper picture on the paleoenvironmental conditions. Geochemical transfer functions have been applied to derive mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature. These kinds of quantitative data on past climate and the stratigraphic data allow us to fit our <b>pedostratigraphic</b> <b>units</b> into a global context. The present paper is aimed at providing new information on the various climatic and environmental characteristics of Pleistocene interglacial periods and soil forming processes...|$|R
40|$|Revised lithologic {{correlations}} between type {{areas of the}} White River Group in Nebraska and South Dakota {{have resulted in a}} new lithostratigraphy for {{the lower part of the}} White River Group. The following <b>pedostratigraphic</b> and lithostratigraphic <b>units,</b> from oldest to youngest, are newly recognized in northwestern Nebraska and can be correlated with units in the Big Badlands of South Dakota: the Yellow Mounds Paleosol Equivalent, Interior and Weta Paleosol Equivalents, Chamberlain Pass Formation, and Peanut Peak Member of the Chadron Formation. The term 2 ̆ 2 Interior Paleosol Complex 2 ̆ 2 for the brightly colored zone at the base of the White River Group in northwestern Nebraska is abandoned in favor of a two-part division. The lower part is related to the Yellow Mounds Paleosol Series of South Dakota, which represents the pedogenically modified Cretaceous Pierre Shale. The upper part of this 2 ̆ 2 Complex 2 ̆ 2 is composed of the unconformably overlying, pedogenically modified overbank mudstone facies of the Chamberlain Pass Formation (which contains the Interior and Weta Paleosol Series in South Dakota). Greenish-white channel sandstones at the base of the White River Group in Nebraska (previously correlated with the Ahearn Member of the Chadron Formation in South Dakota) are here correlated with the channel sandstone facies of the Chamberlain Pass Formation in South Dakota. The Chamberlain Pass Formation is unconformably overlain by the Chadron Formation in South Dakota and Nebraska. Unlike the threefold division of the Chadron Formation into the Ahearn, Crazy Johnson, and Peanut Peak Members in South Dakota, only the bluish green, hummocky-weathering mudstones of the Peanut Peak Member are present in northwestern Nebraska. The remainder of the Chadron Formation in northwestern Nebraska, the 2 ̆ 2 Chadron B 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Chadron C 2 ̆ 2, is included within the newly defined Big Cottonwood Creek Member. The contact between the Peanut Peak and Big Cottonwood Creek Members of the Chadron Formation in northwestern Nebraska is intertonguing, except where strata of the Big Cottonwood Creek Member fill depressions and minor valleys in the Peanut Peak Member. ...|$|R
