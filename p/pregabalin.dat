5|$|Guidelines {{issued by}} the UK-based National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), carried out a {{systematic}} review using different methodology {{and came to a}} different conclusion. They questioned the accuracy of studies that were not placebo-controlled. And, based on the findings of placebo-controlled studies, they do not recommend use of benzodiazepines beyond two to four weeks, as tolerance and physical dependence develop rapidly, with withdrawal symptoms including rebound anxiety occurring after six weeks or more of use. Nevertheless, benzodiazepines are still prescribed for long-term treatment of anxiety disorders, although specific antidepressants and psychological therapies are recommended as the first-line treatment options with the anticonvulsant drug <b>pregabalin</b> indicated as a second- or third-line treatment and suitable for long-term use. NICE stated that long-term use of benzodiazepines for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia is an unlicensed indication, does not have long-term efficacy, and is, therefore, not recommended by clinical guidelines. Psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy are recommended as a first-line therapy for panic disorder; benzodiazepine use has been found to interfere with therapeutic gains from these therapies.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pregabalin</b> is {{eliminated}} from the systemic circulation primarily by renal excretion as unchanged drug. Renal clearance of <b>pregabalin</b> is 73 mL/minute.|$|E
25|$|United States: During {{clinical}} trials {{a small number}} of users (~4%) reported euphoria after use, which led to its control in the US. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) classified <b>pregabalin</b> as a depressant and placed <b>pregabalin,</b> including its salts, and all products containing <b>pregabalin</b> into Schedule V of the Controlled Substances Act.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pregabalin</b> {{has been}} shown to cross the blood–brain barrier in mice, rats, and monkeys. <b>Pregabalin</b> {{has been shown}} to cross the {{placenta}} in rats and is present in the milk of lactating rats. In humans, the volume of distribution of <b>pregabalin</b> for an orally administered dose is approximately 0.56 L/kg and is not bound to plasma proteins.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pregabalin</b> {{undergoes}} negligible metabolism in humans. In experiments using {{nuclear medicine}} techniques, {{it was revealed}} that approximately 98% of the radioactivity recovered in the urine was unchanged <b>pregabalin.</b> The major metabolite is N-methylpregabalin.|$|E
25|$|Following abrupt or rapid {{discontinuation}} of <b>pregabalin,</b> {{some people}} reported symptoms suggestive of physical dependence. The FDA {{determined that the}} substance dependence profile of <b>pregabalin,</b> as measured by a patient physical withdrawal checklist, was quantitatively less than benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pregabalin</b> {{is rapidly}} absorbed when {{administered}} {{on an empty}} stomach, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within one hour. <b>Pregabalin</b> oral bioavailability {{is estimated to be}} {{greater than or equal to}} 90% and is independent of dose. The rate of <b>pregabalin</b> absorption is decreased when given with food resulting in a decrease in Cmax by approximately 25 to 30% and a delay in Tmax (time to reach Cmax) to approximately 3 hours. Administration with food, however, has no clinically significant effect on the extent of absorption.|$|E
25|$|No {{interactions}} {{have been}} demonstrated in vivo. The manufacturer notes some potential pharmacological interactions with opioids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, ethanol (alcohol), and other drugs that depress the central nervous system. ACE inhibitors may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of <b>Pregabalin.</b> <b>Pregabalin</b> may enhance the fluid-retaining effect of Antidiabetic Agents (Thiazolidinedione).|$|E
25|$|The anti-convulsant drugs {{gabapentin}} and <b>pregabalin</b> {{may be used}} {{to reduce}} pain. Gabapentin may be of significant benefit for pain relief in about 35% of people with fibromyalgia. It is not possible to predict who will benefit, and a short trial may be recommended to test the effectiveness of this type of medication. Approximately 6/10 people who take gabapentin to treat pain related to fibromyalgia experience unpleasant side effects such as dizziness, abnormal walking, or swelling from fluid accumulation. <b>Pregabalin</b> demonstrates a substantial benefit in about 9% of people. <b>Pregabalin</b> reduced time off work by 0.2 days per week.|$|E
25|$|It {{can take}} up to three months to derive benefit from the {{antidepressant}} amitriptyline and between three and six months to gain the maximal response from duloxetine, milnacipran, and <b>pregabalin.</b> Some medications have the potential to cause withdrawal symptoms when stopping so gradual discontinuation may be warranted particularly for antidepressants and <b>pregabalin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Several {{renal failure}} {{patients}} developed myoclonus while receiving <b>pregabalin,</b> apparently {{as a result}} of gradual accumulation of the drug. Acute overdosage may be manifested by somnolence, tachycardia and hypertonicity. Plasma, serum or blood concentrations of <b>pregabalin</b> may be measured to monitor therapy or to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pregabalin</b> is 6 {{times more}} potent than {{gabapentin}} in binding affinity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pregabalin</b> is {{generally}} not regarded as efficacious {{in the treatment of}} acute pain. Trials examining the utility of <b>pregabalin</b> for the treatment of acute post-surgical pain, no effect on overall pain levels was observed, but people did require less morphine and had fewer opioid-related side effects. Several possible mechanisms for pain improvement have been discussed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pregabalin</b> is 2 to 4 {{times more}} potent as an {{analgesic}} than gabapentin.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has {{approved}} <b>pregabalin</b> for adjunctive therapy for adults with partial onset seizures, management of postherpetic neuralgia and neuropathic pain associated with {{spinal cord injury}} and diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and the treatment of fibromyalgia. <b>Pregabalin</b> has also been approved in the European Union and Russia (but not in US) for treatment of generalized anxiety disorder.|$|E
25|$|The European Federation of Neurological Societies {{recommends}} <b>pregabalin</b> as a {{first line}} agent {{for the treatment of}} pain associated with diabetic neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia, and central neuropathic pain. A minority obtain substantial benefit, and a larger number obtain moderate benefit. Other first line agents, including gabapentin and tricyclic antidepressants, are given equal weight as first line agents, and unlike <b>pregabalin,</b> are available as less expensive generics.|$|E
25|$|Neither {{gabapentin}} nor <b>pregabalin</b> {{have been}} found to be useful for pain following a knee replacement.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pregabalin</b> {{may help}} reduce the {{severity}} of benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms, and {{reduce the risk of}} relapse.|$|E
25|$|When {{studied in}} non-humans <b>pregabalin</b> {{appears to be}} 3 to 10 times more potent as an {{anticonvulsant}} than gabapentin.|$|E
25|$|Parke-Davis {{developed}} <b>pregabalin</b> as {{a successor}} to gabapentin and was brought to market by Pfizer after the company acquired Warner-Lambert. There is to be no generic version available in the United States until 2018. A generic version is available in Canada and the United Kingdom. In the US it costs about 300-400 USD per month. <b>Pregabalin</b> is a Schedule V controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (CSA).|$|E
25|$|<b>Pregabalin</b> is a GABAergic {{anticonvulsant}} and depressant of {{the central}} nervous system (CNS). It is classified as a GABA analogue and gabapentinoid. It is a close analogue of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). <b>Pregabalin</b> binds with high affinity to the α2δ subunit-containing voltage-gated calcium channels (VDCC). It increases extracellular GABA concentrations in the brain by producing a dose-dependent increase in L-Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the enzyme responsible for making GABA.|$|E
25|$|Norway: <b>Pregabalin</b> is in {{prescription}} Schedule C, {{the lowest}} schedule, {{although it has}} been suggested that it be moved to Schedule B alongside benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|Gabapentinoids, such as {{gabapentin}} and <b>pregabalin,</b> are selective blockers of α2δ subunit-containing voltage-gated calcium channels. They {{are used}} primarily to treat epilepsy and neuropathic pain.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pregabalin</b> was {{synthesized}} in 1990 as an anticonvulsant. It {{was invented}} by medicinal chemist Richard Bruce Silverman at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. Silverman {{is best known for}} identifying the drug <b>pregabalin</b> as a possible treatment for epileptic seizures. During 1988 to 1990, Ryszard Andruszkiewicz, a visiting research fellow, synthesized a series of molecules for Silverman. One looked particularly promising. The molecule was effectively shaped for transportation into the brain, where it activated L-Glutamic acid decarboxylase, an enzyme. Silverman hoped that the enzyme would increase production of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA and block convulsions. Eventually, the set of molecules were sent to Parke-Davis Pharmaceuticals for testing. The drug was approved in the European Union in 2004. The US received FDA approval for use in treating epilepsy, diabetic neuropathic pain, and postherpetic neuralgia in December 2004. <b>Pregabalin</b> then appeared on the US market under the brand name Lyrica in fall of 2005.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} <b>pregabalin</b> appear after 1 week {{of use and}} is similar in {{effectiveness}} to lorazepam, alprazolam, and venlafaxine, but <b>pregabalin</b> has demonstrated superiority by producing more consistent therapeutic effects for psychosomatic anxiety symptoms. Long-term trials have shown continued effectiveness without the development of tolerance, and, in addition, unlike benzodiazepines, it has a beneficial effect on sleep and sleep architecture, characterized by the enhancement of slow-wave sleep. It produces less severe cognitive and psychomotor impairment compared to those drugs; {{it also has a}} low potential for abuse and dependence and may be preferred over the benzodiazepines for these reasons.|$|E
25|$|Health Canada and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have {{approved}} <b>pregabalin</b> and duloxetine, {{for the management}} of fibromyalgia. The FDA also approved milnacipran, but the European Medicines Agency refused marketing authority.|$|E
25|$|Favored {{treatments}} are certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressant and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), anticonvulsants (<b>pregabalin</b> and gabapentin), and topical lidocaine. Opioid analgesics {{are recognized as}} useful agents but are not recommended as first line treatments.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of Cymbalta (duloxetine) and Lyrica (<b>pregabalin)</b> has also {{proven to be}} useful in controlling pain, but many EM patients have found this combination has side effects that {{they are unable to}} tolerate.|$|E
25|$|Even {{people who}} have {{discontinued}} short term and or long term use of <b>pregabalin</b> have experienced withdrawal symptoms, including insomnia, headache, agitation, nausea, anxiety, diarrhea, flu like symptoms, nervousness, major depression, pain, convulsions, hyperhidrosis and dizziness.|$|E
25|$|Northwestern University invented <b>pregabalin</b> {{and holds}} {{a patent on}} it, which it {{exclusively}} licensed to Pfizer. That patent, along with others, was challenged by generic manufacturers and was upheld in 2014, giving Pfizer exclusivity for Lyrica in the US until 2018.|$|E
25|$|Lyrica (<b>pregabalin)</b> for neuropathic pain. Sales of Lyrica were $4.6 {{billion in}} 2013; the US patent on Lyrica was {{challenged}} by generic manufacturers and was upheld in 2014, giving Pfizer exclusivity for Lyrica in the US until 2018.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pregabalin</b> {{is useful}} when added to other {{treatments}}, when those other treatments are not controlling partial epilepsy. Its use alone is less effective {{than some other}} seizure medications. It is unclear how it compares to gabapentin for this use.|$|E
