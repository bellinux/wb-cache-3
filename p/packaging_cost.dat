50|$|After IC packaging, a {{packaged}} chip will {{be tested}} again during the IC testing phase, usually with the same or very similar test patterns. For this reason, one might think that wafer testing is an unnecessary, redundant step.

However, when the production yield is so high that wafer testing is {{more expensive than the}} <b>packaging</b> <b>cost</b> of defect devices, the wafer testing step can be skipped altogether and dies will undergo blind assembly.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Product cost is a {{key driver}} in the {{consumer}} electronics market, which is characterized by low profit margins {{and the use of}} a variety of “big-D/small-A ” mixed-signal system-onchip (SoC) designs. <b>Packaging</b> <b>cost</b> has recently emerged as a major contributor to the product cost for such SoCs. Waferlevel testing can be used to screen defective dies, thereby reducing <b>packaging</b> <b>cost.</b> We propose a new correlation-based signature analysis technique that is especially suitable for mixed-signal test at the wafer-level using low-cost digital testers. The proposed method overcomes the limitations of measurement inaccuracies at the wafer-level. A generic cost model is developed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} wafer-level testing of analog and digital cores in a mixed-signal SoC, and to study its impact on test escapes, yield loss and packaging costs. Experimental results are presented for a typical mixed-signal “big-D/small-A ” SoC, which contains a large section of flattened digital logic and several large mixed-signal cores. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In a {{low-cost}} integrated circuit (IC) chip, the <b>packaging</b> <b>cost</b> {{is a considerable}} portion of the total manufac-turing cost of the chip. As the <b>packaging</b> <b>cost</b> {{is directly related to}} the total number of I/O pins, it is highly desirable to minimize the number of I/O pins while maintaining the same functionality. We propose a capacitive sensor that supports multiple touch switches with only two IC pins. The electrode plates of the touch switches are placed at the ends of a resistor string and between every two adjacent resistors in the resistor string. The proposed method measures rise times at each side of the resistor string while driving the opposite side. The capacitive sensor can recognize an electrode plate contacted by a nger using the two rise times and the proposed rise time model. Experimental results with four touch plates show that the proposed capacitive sensor gives 181 fF resolution and can handle four touch switches...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Efficiency of a {{manufacturing}} system {{depends on the}} capability of production to transform customer orders into products. Elimination of seven production wastes (i. e. defects, waiting, inventory, overproduction, transportation, motion, over-processing) is the concept used in Lean Manufacturing system to improve manufacturing efficiency. In this regard, the seven production wastes cause additional costs to the total product cost. Therefore, this paper aims to introduce a data model of product cost measurement system named as Product Cost System (PCS). The PCS will compute cost of a unit product {{that is important to}} the calculation of Production Waste Index (PWI). Thus, the concept of Relational Database Design has been applied in the development of PCS architecture. As the PWI will be measured on a monthly basis, the PCS database has been designed for calculating cost of a unit product based on one month production period. In this regard, the PCS data model integrates production input (order) quantity with materials cost, <b>packaging</b> <b>cost,</b> and labor cost. However, this paper presents only the first part of PCS that focuses on material cost and <b>packaging</b> <b>cost.</b> For the second part of PCS, a system for determining labor cost per unit product will be developed which is named as Labor Cost System (LCS). Then, both parts of PCS will be integrated to determine the PWI. Result of the first part of PCS prototype shows that further improvement is required in the aspect of bugs and errors...|$|E
