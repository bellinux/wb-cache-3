5|$|While {{the video}} was filmed {{as a single}} shot on at least three {{different}} occasions, they planned on using <b>post-editing</b> to slow down or speed up {{certain parts of the}} take to keep it in time with the final soundtrack. There is a noted cut in the video, in which the camera passes through a set of curtains on the transition to the downstairs portion of the machine; according to one of the machine designers, Hector Alvarez, this cut was introduced by the band, speculating it was introduced to avoid a shot of one of the band members or cameraman in frame or otherwise to keep the machine video synchronized to the machine. Both Tim Nordwind, bassist for the band, and Adam Sadowsky, president of Syyn Labs, said that while the machine worked in its entirety 3 times, and no cut was needed, the decision was made so a better result on the downstairs portion could be included in the final version. There was also a second cut which can be noticed by watching a piano against a wall as the camera passed behind some rods; the piano can be seen apparently warping in shape and position.|$|E
5|$|To {{create the}} {{character}} animations for the game, actors {{were placed in}} front of a gray background and performed the motions, which were recorded on videotape (using a broadcast-quality, $20,000 Sony camera instead of the standard Hi8 camera used for the original Mortal Kombat). The video capture footage was then processed into a computer, and the background was removed from selected frames to create sprites. Towards the end of the game's development, they opted to instead use a blue screen technique and processed the footage directly into the computer for a similar, simpler process. The actors were lightly sprayed with water to give them a sweaty, glistening appearance, while <b>post-editing</b> was done on the sprites afterward to highlight flesh tones and improve the visibility of muscles, which Tobias felt set the series apart from similar games using digitized graphics. Animations of Shang Tsung morphing into other characters were created by Midway's John Vogel using a computer, while hand-drawn animations were used for other parts of the game, such as the Fatalities. For animating Goro and Kintaro, clay sculptures were created by Tobias' friend Curt Chiarelli and then turned into 12-inch latex miniatures that were used for stop motion filming. Because of technical restrictions, the actors' costumes had to be simple and no acrobatic moves such as backflips could have been recorded; the hardest moves to perform were some of the jumping kicks.|$|E

25|$|Production of {{an average}} episode of MST3K during the Comedy Central period took about five to nine days once the movie was {{selected}} and its rights secured. The first few days were generally used for watching the film and scripting out the riffs and live action segments. The subsequent days were then generally used to start construction of any props or sets that would be needed for the live action segments while the writers honed the script. A full dress rehearsal would then be held, making sure the segments and props worked and fine tuning the script. The host segments would then be filmed on one day, and the theater segments on the next. A final day was used to review the completed work and correct any major flaws they caught before considering the episode complete. Live scenes used only practical special effects, and there was minimal <b>post-editing</b> once filming was completed.|$|E

40|$|This {{study used}} special reading-comprehension tests {{to compare the}} speed and {{accuracy}} with which the same Russian technical articles in physics, earth sciences, and electrical engineering could be read by technically sophisticated readers when they were presented in English translated from the original Russian by machine only, by machine plus postediting, and by normal manual procedures. Thus, the emphasis was on the transmission of the technical message rather than on linguistic characteristics. In general, the results consistently showed that manual translations exceeded <b>post-edited</b> translations, which exceeded machine translations across all three disciplines and various types of questions. Losses in speed and efficiency were substantially greater than in accuracy, and differences between machine alone and <b>post-edited</b> generally exceeded differences between <b>post-edited</b> and manual translations.

50|$|However, <b>post-editing</b> {{efficiency}} {{is difficult to}} predict. Various studies from both academia and industry have shown that <b>post-editing</b> is generally faster than translating from scratch, regardless of language pairs or translators' experience.

40|$|Using machine {{translation}} output {{as a starting}} point for human translation has become an increasingly common applica-tion of MT. We propose and evaluate three computationally efficient online methods for updating statistical MT systems in a scenario where <b>post-edited</b> MT output is constantly being returned to the system: (1) adding new rules to the translation model from the <b>post-edited</b> content, (2) updating a Bayesian language model of the target language that is used by the MT system, and (3) updating the MT system’s discriminative parameters with a MIRA step. Individually, these tech-niques can substantially improve MT qual-ity, even over strong baselines. Moreover, we see super-additive improvements when all three techniques are used in tandem. ...|$|R
40|$|Improving machine {{translation}} (MT) by learning from human <b>post-edits</b> {{is a powerful}} solution that is still unexplored in the neural {{machine translation}} (NMT) framework. Also in this scenario, effective techniques for the continuous tuning of an existing model to a stream of manual corrections would have several advantages over current batch methods.

To attack the problem, we explore several online learning strategies to stepwise fine-tune an existing model to the incoming <b>post-edits.</b> Our evaluation on data from two language pairs and different target domains shows significant improvements over the use of static models...|$|R

50|$|<b>Post-editing</b> (or postediting) is {{the process}} whereby humans amend machine-generated {{translation}} to achieve an acceptable final product. A person who post-edits is called a post-editor. The concept of <b>post-editing</b> is linked to that of pre-editing. In the process of translating a text via machine translation, best results may be gained by pre-editing the source textfor example by applying the principles of controlled languageand then <b>post-editing</b> the machine output. It is distinct from editing, which refers {{to the process of}} improving human generated text (a process which is often known as revision in the field of translation). Post-edited text may afterwards be revised to ensure the quality of the language choices or proofread to correct simple mistakes.|$|E

Both translators worked at the same legal document from English into Italian and German, respectively. Although exactly the same amount of translations was available each day for each language, the application of the same adaptation methods resulted in quite different outcomes. This suggests that adaptation strategies should not be applied blindly, but rather taking into account language specific issues, such as data sparsity...|$|R
50|$|After {{some thirty}} years, <b>post-editing</b> is still “a nascent profession”. What the right {{profile of the}} {{post-editor}} is {{has not yet been}} fully studied. <b>Post-editing</b> overlaps with translating and editing, but only partially. Most think the ideal post-editor will be a translator keen to be trained on the specific skills required, but there are some who think a bilingual without a background in translation may be easier to train. Not much is known either on who the actual post-editors are, whether they tend to be professional translators, whether they work mostly as in-house employees or self-employed, and on which conditions. Many professional translators dislike <b>post-editing,</b> among other reasons because it tends to be paid at lower rates than conventional translations, with the International Association of Professional Translators and Interpreters (IAPTI) having been particularly vocal about it.|$|E

40|$|A hot {{task in the}} Computer Assisted Translation {{scenario}} is the integration of Machine Translation (MT) systems that adapt sentence after sentence to the <b>post-edits</b> made by the translators. A main role in the MT online adaptation process is played by the information extracted from source and <b>post-edited</b> sentences, which in turn depends {{on the quality of}} the word alignment between them. In fact, this step is particularly crucial when the user corrects the MT output with words for which the system has no prior infor-mation. In this paper, we first discuss the application of popular state-of-the-art word aligners to this scenario and reveal their poor performance in aligning un-known words. Then, we propose a fast procedure to refine their outputs and to get more reliable and accurate alignments for unknown words.
