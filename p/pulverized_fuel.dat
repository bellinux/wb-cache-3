50|$|The {{tube mill}} output (responding to boiler load demand) is {{controlled}} by regulating the primary air-flow. This regulation, by sweeping <b>pulverized</b> <b>fuel</b> from the mill, is very fast; comparable with oil firing response, but needs the coal level to be maintained in the mill. A control circuit monitors the coal level in the mill, and controls {{the speed of the}} raw coal feeder to maintain it. Maintaining the coal level in the mill offers a built-in capacity cushion of <b>pulverized</b> <b>fuel</b> to take care of short interruptions in the raw coal circuit.|$|E
50|$|The mill is {{pressurized}} and the air-tightness is {{ensured by}} plenum chambers around the rotating trunnion filled with pressurized seal air. Bleeding seal air from plenum chamber to the mill maintains separation between <b>pulverized</b> <b>fuel</b> in the Mill {{and the outside}} atmosphere. Inadequacy or absence of seal air will allow escape of <b>pulverized</b> <b>fuel</b> into atmosphere. On the other hand, an excess of seal air leaking into mill will affect the mill outlet temperature. As such the seal air is controlled by a local control damper maintaining just sufficient differential pressure for sealing.|$|E

Gasification produces a much higher concentration of carbon dioxide than direct combustion of coal in air. In view of these, gasification energy combined with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software has been described in some detail in the following study. The aspect of gasification processes have been investigated for down-draft gasifier using simulation in FLUENT software.

40|$|Rising global energy demands {{have led}} to an {{increase}} in demand for clean, sustainable energy. A leading technology for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emission for existing coal-power infrastructure is gasification, which has sparked an interest in reactor modelling for design and performance analysis. Reduced order models (ROMs) have seen an increase in popularity for entrained flow gasifiers, as they offer a low-computational alternative to conventional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modelling while maintaining the integrity of important operational parameters, such as carbon conversion and syngas yield. However, ROMs require more physical parameter inputs than are normally required for CFD modelling, such as the geometry of the gas-solid jet (specifically the jet half-angle). Experiments were conducted to understand the relation between the required input parameters for ROMs, such as fuel flow rate, transport gas flow rate, and jet half-angle, and develop useful correlations for ROM systems. A new configuration for pneumatic conveying was developed and tested at the pilot-scale system at NRCan CanmetENERGY. It was used to study the pneumatic conveying of <b>pulverized</b> <b>fuels,</b> specifically the influence of operating parameters such as pressure drop and gas flow rates on the fuel flow rate, and the geometry of the gas-solid fuel jet (notably the jet half-angle) injected into the gasifier. The mean fuel flow rate of <b>pulverized</b> <b>fuels</b> was shown to increase with increasing pressure drop and with decreasing gas flow rates in the fuel transfer line. The jet half-angle was shown to increase as the solid loading ratio in the jet core was decreased. Finally, the relative fuel flow variability was observed to be significantly influenced by the design of the pneumatic conveying system, with the fluctuations increasing with increasing pressure drop and with decreasing gas flow rate, similar to the mean flow rate...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} avoid excess {{sweeping}} of coal from the mill, {{only part of the}} primary air, directly proportional to the boiler load demand, is passed through the mill. Furthermore, to ensure sufficient velocity of <b>pulverized</b> <b>fuel</b> to avoid settling in the pipes, an additional quantity of primary air is fed into a mixing box on the raw coal circuit. This by-pass air tapped from the primary air duct going into the mill makes an appreciable contribution to the drying of raw coal, by a flash drying effect, in addition to picking up the <b>pulverized</b> <b>fuel</b> from the mill outlet for its transportation towards the classifiers.|$|E

50|$|B+C Stations:-In 1949 two 15MW Parsons {{turbo-generators}} {{were installed}} in an adjacent site. Steam was supplied by large oil-fired water tube boilers.

50|$|The {{primary air}} input to a ball tube mill {{performs}} a dual function. It {{is used for}} drying and as the fuel transport medium, and by regulating it the mill output is regulated. Governed by the <b>pulverized</b> <b>fuel</b> outlet temperature requirement, the cold air and hot air dampers are regulated to achieve the correct primary air temperature. In addition to raising the coal temperature inside the mill for drying and better grinding, the same air works as the transport medium to move the pulverized coal out of the mill: it travels through the annular space between the fixed trunnion tubes and the rotating hot air tube onwards to the classifier. Coal-laden air passes through double cone static classifiers, with adjustable classifier vanes, for segregation into <b>pulverized</b> <b>fuel</b> of the desired fineness, and coarse particles. The pulverised fuel continues its journey towards the coal burners for combustion. The coarse particles rejected in the classifier are returned to the mill for another cycle of grinding.|$|E

5000|$|The {{rotary kiln}} {{consists}} of a tube made from steel plate, and lined with firebrick. The tube slopes slightly (1-4°) and slowly rotates on its axis at between 30 and 250 revolutions per hour.

At the other end fuel, in the form of gas, oil, or <b>pulverized</b> solid <b>fuel,</b> is blown in through the [...] "burner pipe", producing a large concentric flame in the lower part of the kiln tube. As material moves under the flame, it reaches its peak temperature, before dropping out of the kiln tube into the cooler. Air is drawn first through the cooler and then through the kiln for combustion of the fuel. In the cooler the air is heated by the cooling clinker, so that it may be 400 to 800 °C before it enters the kiln, thus causing intense and rapid combustion of the fuel.|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{releases}} of insoluble nuclear fuel compounds may occur at {{nuclear power plants}} during normal operation, after nuclear power plant accidents, {{and as a consequence}} of nuclear weapons testing. For example, the Chernobyl fallout contained extensive amounts of <b>pulverized</b> nuclear <b>fuel</b> composed of uranium and its nonvolatile fission products. The effects of these highly radioactive particles, also called hot particles, on humans are not well known due to lack of reliable data on the extent of the exposure. However, the biokinetics and biological effects of nuclear fuel compounds have been investigated in a number of experimental studies using various cellular systems and laboratory animals. In this article, we review the biokinetic properties and effects of insoluble nuclear fuel compounds, with special reference to UO 2, PuO 2, and nonvolatile, long-lived beta-emitters Zr, Nb, Ru, and Ce. First, the data on hot particles, including sources, dosimetry, and human exposure are discussed.

40|$|Experimental and {{modeling}} investigations {{have been performed}} on the co-combustion of a traditional fossil fuel and a tire residue. The experimental runs {{have been carried out}} using a pilot-scale vertical furnace (0. 5 MW) with a burner for <b>pulverized</b> solid <b>fuels.</b> Different conditions have been set up for the co-combustion of a medium volatile bituminous coal and a tire residue. The scope was to test the feasibility of burning secondary fuels (biomasses and residues) with coals using a low NOx burner developed for pulverized coal in the ENEL Research Centre. A co-combustion model was developed for interpreting the results and extrapolating kinetic parameters to practical conditions. It considers the effect of the particle size distribution, the different reactivity, and, in general, the different combustion behavior of each fuel fed to the furnace. The kinetic scheme adopted is simple and the introduced assumptions allow easy coupling with computational reactive fluid dynamic codes. Fuel conversion, oxygen concentration and carbon-in-ash profiles have been computed and compared with the experimental results. Quite good agreement has been obtained, allowing kinetic information to be used in more comprehensive descriptions of full-scale systems...|$|R

5000|$|The {{concept of}} burning coal {{that has been}} {{pulverized}} into a fine powder stems from the belief that if the coal is made fine enough, it will burn almost as easily and efficiently as a gas. The feeding rate of coal according to the boiler demand {{and the amount of}} air available for drying and transporting the <b>pulverized</b> coal <b>fuel</b> is controlled by computers. Pieces of coal are crushed between balls or cylindrical rollers that move between two tracks or [...] "races." [...] The raw coal is then fed into the pulverizer along with air heated to about 650°F / 340°C from the boiler. As the coal gets crushed by the rolling action, the hot air dries it and blows the usable fine coal powder out to be used as fuel. The powdered coal from the pulverizer is directly blown to a burner in the boiler. The burner mixes the powdered coal in the air suspension with additional pre-heated combustion air and forces it out of a nozzle similar in action to fuel being atomized by a fuel injector in modern cars. Under operating conditions, there is enough heat in the combustion zone to ignite all the incoming fuel.|$|R
40|$|The current {{trend in}} the steel {{industry}} {{is an increase in}} iron and steel produced in electric arc furnaces (EAF) and a gradual decline in conventional steelmaking from taconite pellets in blast furnaces. In order to expand the opportunities for the existing iron ore mines beyond their blast furnace customer base, a new material is needed to satisfy the market demands of the emerging steel industry while utilizing the existing infrastructure and materials handling capabilities. This demand creates opportunity to convert iron ore or other iron bearing materials to Nodular Reduced Iron (NRI) in a recently designed Linear Hearth Furnace (LHF). NRI is a metallized iron product containing 98. 5 to 96. 0 % iron and 2. 5 to 4 % C. It is essentially a scrap substitute with little impurity that can be utilized in a variety of steelmaking processes, especially the electric arc furnace. The objective of this project was to focus on reducing the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) through reducing the energy intensity using specialized combustion systems, increasing production and the use of biomass derived carbon sources in this process. This research examined the use of a solid fuel-oxygen fired combustion system and compared the results from this system with both oxygen-fuel and air-fuel combustion systems. The solid <b>pulverized</b> <b>fuels</b> tested included various coals and a bio-coal produced from woody biomass in a specially constructed pilot scale torrefaction reactor at the Coleraine Minerals Research Laboratory (CMRL). In addition to combustion, the application of bio-coal was also tested as a means to produce a reducing atmosphere during key points in the fusion process, and as a reducing agent for ore conversion to metallic iron to capture the advantage of its inherent reduced carbon footprint. The results from this study indicate that the approaches taken can reduce both greenhouse gas emissions and the associated energy intensity with the Linear Hearth Furnace process for converting iron ore to metallic iron nodules. Various types of coals including a bio-coal produced though torrefaction can result in production of NRI at reduced GHG levels. The process results coupled with earlier already reported developments indicate that this process technique should be evaluated at the next level in order to develop parameter information for full scale process design. Implementation of the process to full commercialization will require a full cost production analysis and comparison to other reduction technologies and iron production alternatives. The technical results verify that high quality NRI can be produced under various operating conditions at the pilot level...|$|R
