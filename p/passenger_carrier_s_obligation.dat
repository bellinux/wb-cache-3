40|$|The UNCITRAL Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods [wholly or partly] by Sea has an {{ambition}} of replacing current maritime regimes and expands {{the application of}} the Convention to include also multimodal transport. This thesis questions what changes to existing law, in certain areas, the new Convention will bring compared to the current regimes. In the initial part, the thesis provides for a brief background and history of international maritime regulations and focuses on the Hamburg and Hague-Visby rules. Then, the most evident changes in the UNCITRAL Convention, compared to current regulations, are then highlighted and discussed and the balance between the carrier ad cargo interests is in the center of such a discussion. The thesis continues to address certain aspects of the <b>carrier</b> <b>s</b> <b>obligations</b> and how these could potentially be affected by the new Convention. In the closing comments I discuss the significance of the new Convention and if the current draft will be able to reach its declared ambitions...|$|R
