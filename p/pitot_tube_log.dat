50|$|A Rosemount Annubar primary {{element is}} an {{averaging}} <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube</b> {{similar to a}} single point <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> {{used to measure the}} flow of gas, steam, or liquid in a pipe. An Annubar primary element or Annubar averaging <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube</b> provides better accuracy than single point <b>Pitot</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The biggest {{difference}} between an Annubar averaging <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube</b> and a <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube</b> is that an Annubar averaging <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube</b> takes multiple samples across a section of a pipe or duct. In this way, it averages the differential pressures encountered accounting for variations in flow across the section. A <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube</b> will give a similar reading if the tip is located {{at a point in}} the pipe cross section where the flowing velocity is close to the average velocity.|$|R

500|$|A blocked <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> is a pitot-static {{problem that}} will only affect {{airspeed}} indicators. [...] A blocked <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> will cause the airspeed indicator to register an increase in airspeed when the aircraft climbs, even though actual airspeed is constant.(As long as the drain hole is also blocked, as the air pressure would otherwise leak out to the atmosphere) [...] This {{is caused by the}} pressure in the pitot system remaining constant when the atmospheric pressure (and static pressure) are decreasing. [...] In reverse, the airspeed indicator will show a decrease in airspeed when the aircraft descends. [...] The <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> is susceptible to becoming clogged by ice, water, insects or some other obstruction. [...] For this reason, aviation regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recommend that the <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> be checked for obstructions prior to any flight. [...] To prevent icing, many <b>pitot</b> <b>tubes</b> are equipped with a heating element. [...] A heated <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> is required in all aircraft certificated for instrument flight except aircraft certificated as Experimental Amateur-Built.|$|R
30|$|The {{theory of}} flow {{measurement}} by <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube</b> was adopted first by a French Scientist Henri Pitot in 1732 A.D. for measuring velocities in the river. The <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube</b> {{is used to}} measure the local velocity at a given point in the flow stream. It is a very simple and low-cost device used to measure mean velocities for various industrial purposes (Bryant et al. 2014; Graham et al. 2013; Oh and Lee 2011). The <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube</b> is not suitable for velocities lower than 5  m/s (Nakra and Chaudhry 2004) because of low pressure differential availability. The <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube</b> has many disadvantages, as ports for pressure measurements require modification to the wall and present potential disturbance to the flow (Liu et al. 1999). The order of error in the measurement of velocity is up to 20  % as reported by Bakke (1957) and the average error is ± 2  % (Nakra and Chaudhry 2004). <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube</b> is not so practicable for turbulence study.|$|R
50|$|Icing is {{a problem}} for <b>pitot</b> <b>tubes</b> when the air {{temperature}} is below freezing and visible moisture is present in the atmosphere, as when flying through cloud or precipitation. Electrically heated <b>pitot</b> <b>tubes</b> are used to prevent ice forming over the tube.|$|R

" This type of surface <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> has great practical advantages, as surface-shear measurements may be made on any model designed for pressure measurements.

Since it was not an Airworthiness Directive, the guidelines allow the operator to apply the recommendations at its discretion.

50|$|Pitot {{pressure}} is {{the pressure that}} is measured by a <b>Pitot</b> <b>tube,</b> an open-ended tube connected to a pressure-measuring device. For subsonic flow, pitot {{pressure is}} equal to the stagnation pressure (or total pressure) of the flow, and hence the term pitot pressure is often used interchangeably with these other terms. For supersonic flow, however, pitot pressure is the stagnation pressure of the flow behind the normal shock ahead of the <b>pitot</b> <b>tube.</b> <b>Pitot</b> pressure is named for Henri Pitot, French scientist.|$|R
5000|$|The pitot {{pressure}} is {{obtained from the}} <b>pitot</b> <b>tube.</b> The <b>pitot</b> pressure {{is a measure of}} ram air pressure (the air pressure created by vehicle motion or the air ramming into the tube), which, under ideal conditions, is equal to stagnation pressure, also called total pressure. The <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> is most often located on the wing or front section of an aircraft, facing forward, where its opening is exposed to the relative wind. [...] By situating the <b>pitot</b> <b>tube</b> in such a location, the ram air pressure is more accurately measured since it will be less distorted by the aircraft's structure. When airspeed increases, the ram air pressure is increased, which can be translated by the airspeed indicator.|$|R
