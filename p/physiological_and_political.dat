40|$|We report {{evidence}} that individual-level variation in people’s <b>physiological</b> <b>and</b> attentional responses to aversive and appetitive stimuli are correlated with broad political orientations. Specifically, {{we find that}} greater orientation to aversive stimuli tends {{to be associated with}} right-of-centre and greater orientation to appetitive (pleasing) stimuli with left-of-centre political inclinations. These findings are consistent with recent {{evidence that}} political views are connected to physiological predispositions but are unique in incorporating findings on variation in directed attention that make it possible to understand additional aspects of the link between the <b>physiological</b> <b>and</b> the <b>political...</b>|$|R
6000|$|The fact is {{that the}} {{sovereign}} power of the body thinks for the physiological organism, acts for it, and rules the individual components with a rod of iron. Even the blood-corpuscles can't hold a public meeting without being accused of [...] "congestion"--and the brain, like other despots whom we have known, calls out at once for the use of sharp steel against them. As in Hobbes's [...] "Leviathan," [...] the representative of the sovereign authority in the living organism, though he derives all his powers from the mass which he rules, is above the law. The questioning of his authority involves death, or that partial death which we call paralysis. Hence, if the analogy of the body politic with the body physiological counts for anything, it {{seems to me to be}} in favour of a much larger amount of governmental interference than exists at present, or than I, for one, at all desire to see. But, tempting as the opportunity is, I am not disposed to build up any argument in favour of my own case upon this analogy, curious, interesting, and in many respects close, as it is, for it takes no cognizance of certain profound and essential differences between the <b>physiological</b> <b>and</b> the <b>political</b> bodies.|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{critically}} evaluate contemporary theory {{on the development}} of addictive behaviours. It acknowledged the complex dynamic relationships between five key variables including; individual, family, society, "stakeholders" and "addictive" substances in developing an interactive model of addiction. The hypothesis suggested that unitary definitions were inadequate, and that addiction was best understood as a complex phenomenon intimately linked to the prevailing social <b>and</b> <b>political</b> climate. The research employed three complementary methods of enquiry including; a comprehensive review of relevant literature, a questionnaire administered to a group of adult students (to "reality check" theoretical frameworks) and a semi-structured groupwork session. The principle findings included; that there was a perceived preoccupation with pathological models of addiction, that addictive behaviours may be seen as functional at several levels of society and that drug and alcohol use were seen to be treated dichotomously in Ireland. It was also suggested that the role of gender issues in substance misuse were poorly understood, that the clear link between social disadvantage and problem use was largely ignored by policy makers and that key stakeholders were seen to create the reality of addiction by defining its parameters, diagnosing it and determining appropriate responses. The recommendations which emerged from the study were directed at both adult educators and policy makers. It was suggested that adult educators should seek to create a radical social critique on addiction by developing appropriate learning transactions, funding addiction related research, challenging politicians and highlighting the role of social disadvantage and gender issues in addictive behaviour. The study concluded that addiction was a complex phenomenon, the development of which, was best understood at the meeting of <b>physiological,</b> psychological, social <b>and</b> <b>political</b> forces. The metaphor of a web was used to represent this complexity...|$|R

30|$|Unfortunately, {{while these}} studies provide {{valuable}} {{insight into the}} <b>physiological</b> <b>and</b> biomechanical demands of running on LBPPT among healthy and recreational runners, there are conflicting evidence and a paucity of data indicating how these results might apply to highly trained or elite caliber runners at the running speeds they habitually train at, which are considerably faster than those of recreational runners [9]. Of the ten studies that met the inclusion criteria for evaluation of physiologic and stride characteristic parameters in a recent systematic review [1], only two studies included highly trained or elite caliber distance runners [9, 12], neither of which included female runners. Previous research has established that differences in <b>physiological</b> <b>and</b> biomechanical characteristics exist between highly trained male and female runners during submaximal normal body weight running [3, 30]. However, data is limited regarding female athlete’s <b>physiological</b> <b>and</b> biomechanical responses to LBPPT running. Lastly, a comprehensive examination of <b>physiological</b> <b>and</b> biomechanical responses to LBPPT running in the same population is lacking. Therefore, {{this study was designed}} to evaluate the <b>physiological</b> <b>and</b> stride characteristic responses to LBPPT running in highly trained male and female distance runners.|$|R
40|$|Music {{listening}} {{has been}} suggested to have short-term beneficial effects. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the association and potential mediating mechanisms between various aspects of habitual music-listening behaviour <b>and</b> <b>physiological</b> <b>and</b> psychological functioning. An internet-based survey was conducted in university students, measuring habitual music-listening behaviour, emotion regulation, stress reactivity, as well as <b>physiological</b> <b>and</b> psychological functioning. A total of 1230 individuals (mean = 24. 89 ± 5. 34 years, 55. 3 % women) completed the questionnaire. Quantitative aspects of habitual music-listening behaviour, i. e. average duration of music listening and subjective relevance of music, were not associated with <b>physiological</b> <b>and</b> psychological functioning. In contrast, qualitative aspects, i. e. reasons for listening (especially 'reducing loneliness and aggression', and 'arousing or intensifying specific emotions') were significantly related to <b>physiological</b> <b>and</b> psychological functioning (all p = 0. 001). These direct effects were mediated by distress-augmenting emotion regulation and individual stress reactivity. The habitual music-listening behaviour appears to be a multifaceted behaviour that is further influenced by dispositions that are usually not related to music listening. Consequently, habitual music-listening behaviour is not obviously linked to <b>physiological</b> <b>and</b> psychological functioning...|$|R
