50|$|The Banking and Payment Authorities of Kosovo (BPK) {{planned to}} {{establish}} an Interbank Payment System since November 2000. This idea was initially supported by the International Monetary Fond (IMF) through their professional payment consultants. The recommendations given were based on three development phases, which helped in creating the existing work plan. With {{the establishment of the}} Interbank <b>Payments</b> Advisory <b>Committee</b> (IPAC) under the patronage of the Central Bank of Kosovo with the participation of all the other commerce banks, the work continued on framing all the other operational policies on this subject.|$|R

40|$|Although {{the last}} few years have seen a {{dramatic}} surge in interest in new electronic payment instruments, consumers and businesses in the United States still write checks in vast numbers. Nearly 63 billion checks were written in 1995 according to one estimate, representing 78. 6 percent of all noncash <b>payments</b> (<b>Committee</b> on Payment and Settlement Systems of the central banks of the Group of Ten countries 1995). Check use has continued to expand in recent years, despite the increased use of debit cards and the automated clearinghouse; the per capita number of checks written grew at an average annual rate of 1. 3 percent from 1991 to 1995. Moreover, forecasts call for check use to remain around current levels for the foreseeable future (Humphrey 1996). Because the social costs {{associated with the use of}} paper checks constitutes the majority of the real resource costs of the payment system— 65. 4 percent according to David Humphrey and Allen Berger (1990) — it will be important to continue to seek improvements in the efficiency of the check system in the years ahead...|$|E

In fiscal year 2003, the House Appropriations Committee directed the Secretary of Defense to reassess program efficiency and report on five concerns: (1) how effective the program is in correcting retention shortfalls in critical occupations, (2) how replacement guidance will ensure targeting critical specialties that impact readiness, (3) how DOD will match program execution with appropriated funding, (4) how well the services' processes for administering the program work, and (5) {{advantages and disadvantages of}} paying bonuses in lump sum <b>payments.</b> The <b>committee</b> also directed GAO to review and assess DOD's report. ...|$|R

50|$|Interbank Clearing System {{started to}} {{function}} on May 7, 2001. This phase was characterized with the manual exchange of payments, with settlements based on NET balance between debit and credit. In this way, the receiving bank account was credited and the debiting account was debited. At the start, since {{the number of}} payment was low, the registrations in account were done manually or on individual bases. This was reached with an agreement between the Interbank Clearing System (ICS) and other participating banks.Another interesting fact regarding the first phase was {{the activity of the}} Interbank <b>Payments</b> Advisory <b>Committee</b> (IPAC). This committee was first composed of several banks like ProCredit Bank, NLB Prishtina, Bank for Business. Moreover, Economic Bank joined in June and, towards the end of 2001, Raiffeissen Bank, BKP, and KSB joined also. The committee’s obligation was to set the operating rules, the procedure, and standards for Interbank Clearing System. After a year, this committee worked toward Electronic Interbank Clearing System (EICS) which would make possible electronic exchange.|$|R
50|$|Marrou {{had most}} of his {{campaign}} staff resign {{during the summer of}} 1992. Many of them sought to have the Libertarian Party strip him of the nomination because he had unpaid child support, had an arrest warrant in Massachusetts for an outstanding contempt of court charge, claimed to have been married twice when it was in fact four times, was being investigated for campaign improprieties from his time in Alaska, was running up unpaid credit card bills in a campaign PAC's name without their approval, and was habitually months late in making his house <b>payments.</b> The national <b>committee</b> decided to take no action for fear it would call attention to these issues.|$|R
50|$|Approximately {{fifteen years}} later, the {{criminal}} Committee learned of Gregor's curse and blackmailed Philip, threatening {{to reveal his}} secrets. To protect Laura's name, Philip paid them but had second thoughts and canceled <b>payment,</b> causing the <b>Committee</b> to send Max Grant to kill Laura. Critically injured {{in a car crash}} on Jack's 18th birthday, Laura barely had time to tell Jack about his true father and the curse of the werewolf, making Jack promise not to harm Philip, before dying. Having inherited lycanthropy the night before, Jack slew Grant, but wrongly blamed Philip for some time. Laura left Castle Russoff in Jack's name, but Philip, the trustee, sold the castle to Miles Blackgar, who had it moved to an island off California's coast. Jack battled a motorcycle gang, infecting its members with lycanthropy.|$|R
5000|$|Barnwood House {{opened its}} doors to {{patients}} on 6 January 1860, but its origins {{go back to the}} 18th century. In 1794 the governors of Gloucester Infirmary decided to follow the York example and raise a subscription for building an asylum. Sir George Onesiphorus Paul, philanthropist and prison reformer, was asked to draft a scheme for the management of the institution. The plans were put on hold as legislation was pending in Parliament. The County Asylums Act, which enabled counties to set up asylums for pauper lunatics on the rates, was passed in 1808 and the subscribers formed a union with the county and the city to build a joint asylum. Wotton asylum was opened in 1823 and the union lasted until 1856, when the County bought out the subscribers and the asylum became a county asylum for paupers. The subscribers began the search for new accommodation for their wealthy and charity patients. In 1858 they purchased and adapted Barnwood House in the village of Barnwood to the east of Gloucester (subsequent boundary changes brought the village inside the city boundary).Barnwood House Institution was intended for two classes of patients, as explained in 1882 regulations:"FIRST - Patients in more or less affluent circumstances, who shall contribute, according to the accommodation required, such sums as may be agreed upon. SECOND - Patients in limited circumstances, but in a position in life to render them unsuitable for admission into County Asylums, who shall be received at such reduced rates of <b>payment</b> as the <b>Committee,</b> upon consideration of the circumstances of each case, may determine; and some even gratuitously, - preference being given to recent and curable cases, to which the gratuitous Patients are to be wholly confined." ...|$|R
40|$|Electronic {{payments}} {{have become}} a prominent feature of the U. S. economic landscape, as consumers, businesses, and governments have increasingly used electronic instruments to make retail payments. Survey research by the Federal Reserve published in 2002, for example, indicates {{that the use of}} debit and credit cards and automatic deposit and withdrawal (via the automated clearinghouse) grew fivefold from 1979 to 2000 and that the use of paper checks for payments probably peaked in the mid- 1990 s. Over the past decade especially, developers have experimented with new ways of making electronic payments. As with many innovations, {{only a small number of}} these new methods of payment have enjoyed commercial success. Nevertheless, developers' inclination to expand the range of options and techniques for making electronic payments has been consistent with the long-term direction of payments activity in the United States.; The Federal Reserve's <b>Payments</b> System Development <b>Committee</b> is concerned about regulatory and operational barriers to innovation that may inhibit the long-term development of the payments system. Accordingly, the committee asked Federal Reserve staff to seek the views of the private sector and other interested parties on developments in payments, clearing, and settlement services, focusing on potential barriers to further innovation and the implications of new technologies for the design and function of payments systems. The staff study "The Future of Retail Electronic Payments Systems: Industry Interviews and Analysis" presents highlights of interviews with representatives of forty-nine organizations and discusses areas in which, in the committee's opinion, the Federal Reserve and other organizations may be able to foster, or help reduce barriers to, innovation in the payments system. The study also provides a more detailed account of the discussions with industry representatives and the recommendations they made.; The study presents nine key issues [...] including settlement timing and standards [...] and accompanying recommendations. No single issue was consistently identified, no single recommendation was made by a significant number of interviewees, and, with a few exceptions, no fundamental problems with or barriers to innovation in existing clearing and settlement arrangements were noted. These results should not, however, be interpreted as satisfaction with the status quo. Rather, they point to the complexity and difficulty of innovation. The results also highlight the need to identify and address barriers to innovation, where appropriate, and to monitor closely clearing and settlement arrangements to ensure that they evolve in ways that support safe and efficient payments today and in the future.
