50|$|The {{results of}} the {{planetary}} periods or dashas depend on the specific strength or weakness of the concerned planet; for the planet to give its best results it should be strong in Shadabala and auspiciously placed {{with reference to the}} lagna without being afflicted by inimical malefic planets. Saturn situated in the 5th house from the lagna does not generally confer good results, though it can confer a long span of life but usually makes one evil-minded and quarrelsome. In the case of Gemini lagna, Saturn situated in the 5th will be in its sign of exaltation as a benefic and as the lord of the 9th house; it will give rise to yoga and Dhana yoga. An exalted planet occupying a trikonabhava makes one fortunate and famous; additionally if the lord of the navamsa of occupation is also situated in a quadrant (kendra) or a trine (trikona) from the lagna in own or exaltation sign then one undoubtedly becomes very fortunate and occupies an eminent position in life. All planets give their good or bad results during the course of their mahadasas and antra-dasas; the results vary from person to person because of the varying conditions and circumstances of their individual births and family back-ground, <b>place</b> <b>and</b> <b>country</b> of birth etc., and because planets are never found identically conditioned in any two individual horoscopes. A planet may give a weak constitution {{but at the same time}} it may also produce financial and professional prosperity. The mental disposition is judged by reference to the Moon, and the liability to diseases and accidents is judged from the planets associating with the Moon, the Sun and the lagna.Jataka Parijata (Ch. XVIII. Sl.58) states that in the beginning the mahadasa lord gives results in accordance with the house it occupies, in the middle, as per the sign it occupies, and at the close, as per the influence of the planetary aspects that improve or afflict the mahadasa lord. And, Mantreswara in his Phaladeepika explains that the gain or loss of things and the events signified by a particular bhava will be experienced when the lord of the lagna transits a trine from the natal position of the bhava-lord or the bhava-lord transits a trine from the natal point of the lagna, or when during the course of their transits they aspect each other or combine in a sign, or when the bhava-karaka transits the natal position of the lord of the lagna or the lord of the sign occupied by the Moon at the time of birth or when the lord of the lagna transits that bhava.|$|E

40|$|There {{is no need}} {{to prove}} the {{significant}} role played by legends, myths and stereotypes {{in the history of the}} world. Also in the Polish lands, we can find many stories connected with the history of the Jews. There is still no comprehensive study on legends concerning Jews in mediaeval Poland, but we already have the book by Haya Bar-Itzhak, a professor of Comparative Hebrew Literature at the Haifa University. 1 An exception here may be the well-known legend about the love affair between King Kazimierz Wielki (Casimir the Great) and the Jewish girl Esther, which has been widely described in many works. Of special importance is the book written by the eminent literary historian and linguist, Chone Shmeruk, entitled “Legenda o Esterce w literaturze jidysz i polskiej ” (The Legend of Esther in Yiddish and Polish Literature). 2 In the Jewish Diaspora, that is in exile, the myths and legends created by the Jews played a variety of functions. An ethnologist, Olga Goldberg-Mulkiewicz, follow-ing the Mircea Eliade’s idea of consecrating the place of settlement, showed that, in the context of the Polish Diaspora, the local Jewish legends played a role in getting familiarized with the foreign <b>place</b> <b>and</b> <b>country.</b> 3 There were also legends in Poland...|$|E
40|$|Masters Research - Master of Philosophy (MPhil) This paper {{examines}} how memory, knowledge and connection are imbued in place. Considering how place can inhabit self and self can inhabit place. This proposition {{is reinforced by}} looking at many models and cross cultural examples {{as well as the}} work of theorists such as Casey, Relph and Blowby. The proposition that we are strongly related to our geographical locations, and by considering the similarities in make up of the earth to our bodies, a case is made that we are biologically and chemically part of the land. This becomes so by acknowledging that what we eat is of the land and hence there is a strong correlation between the two. It is then considered that since we are part of the land the land in turn becomes part of us. The off campus performance work On becoming a Witch provided a very powerful link between the exegesis and the studio work. It examined yet another way in which one is able to relate to country by the use of ritual, myth and symbolism in a specific bush setting. It brought together skills related to theatre, opera, costume design and music. This has been fully documented as part of the exegesis. The studio component of this thesis {{examines how}} one can closely relate one’s paintings and drawings to a sense of <b>place</b> <b>and</b> <b>country</b> by the use of materials such as ochres and the use of strong simple abstract forms. The use of a dominant symbol, the ziggurat, has been explained as well as the processes used with the result being a series of strong paintings and drawings.

40|$|This study aims at {{analyzing}} a slum {{situation at}} Gondar city in Ethiopia, {{looking into the}} life of slum dwellers and inquiring into causes and processes of slum formation and transformation, and tries to identify problems. One of the major problems of an urban area is a slum. Slum communities are usually inhabited by socially disadvantaged people (people regarded as lower caste). It is generally found in periphery of old inner city. Slum is a marginalized area {{from the point of view}} of old settlements and these days, which is being occupied by new migrants. it is more common in developing countries [...] It can be also defined by poverty, low income, inadequate living conditions and sub-standard facilities. Slum is universal in nature. The situation of slum varies from place to <b>place</b> <b>and</b> <b>country</b> to country. Since each slum being formed different ways and slum dwellers experiencing different hardships according to different socio-economic environments. Slums in developing countries normally have multi-dimensional problems from housing to socioeconomic problems. Poor, mostly emigrants from rural areas, are concentrated in slum areas. This study is conducted in Gondar town, to investigate the major socio – economic challenges of people living slum area. The study employs both qualitative and quantitative method. The main objective of this study is to identify and investigate the major socio- economic challenge of people living in the slum area in Gondar town.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how human connections to place, specifically between the Manilikarr clan and their {{estate in the}} East Alligator River region of western Arnhem Land, have changed during the Holocene. I focus on the later Holocene, in particular the period since regional freshwater wetlands formed, as it is this environment that retains ontological significance for local Aboriginal groups in the East Alligator River region today. Aboriginal connections with place are also more decipherable in archaeological horizons that are comparable and contiguous with ethnographic records, as is frequently the case for ‘freshwater’ archaeological sites of recent times. As Aboriginal people engaged with wetlands, they created both freshwater places and personhoods through symbiotic processes of inscription. Freshwater landscapes in the East Alligator River region were imbued with memories, meanings and social significance and became crucial to Aboriginal economic, ecological and cosmological structures. My research examines both when, and how, processes of co-inscription between people and place occurred, primarily through archaeological excavations at three rock-shelters in Manilikarr Country (Ingaanjalwurr, Birriwilk and Bindjarran). The results of these excavations, together with subsidiary evidence from ethnographic recordings, historical sources, rock art research, and palaeoenvironmental studies, indicate that ethnographically recalled Aboriginal engagements with, and significations of, the freshwater landscape in Manilikarr Country emerged within the past 700 years. Customary Aboriginal connections with the freshwater environment remain culturally relevant today, although they are increasingly compromised by cultural change. The impacts of Western worldviews continue to pose enduring challenges for customary engagements with Country, especially among younger generations. Such challenges mean that research like that presented in this thesis, which examines Ancestral-into-present relations between wetland landscapes and people, is of social, cultural and political significance considering contemporary risks posed by rapid social and environmental change. While members of Manilikarr Country ethnographically identified as ‘freshwater people’ and {{continue to do so}} today, senior members are keenly aware that decreasing engagements of younger generations with their Ancestral landscapes (as Country) threatens the longevity and future of their identity as freshwater peoples. It is these connections to <b>place</b> <b>and</b> <b>Country</b> that form the subject of this thesis...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{relationships}} between people, water, and places in the everyday life of the Yolngu people of Yilpara in northeast Arnhem Land. In the Yolngu world, a sophisticated understanding of the fluid and dynamic relationships between fresh and saltwater is given a greater priority than {{the division of the}} coast into land and sea. These waters are continually moving and mixing, both underground and on the surface, across an area that stretches from several kilometres inland to the deep sea, and they combine with clouds, rain, tides, and seasonal patterns in a coastal water cycle. Yolngu people use their understanding of water flows as one basis for generating systems of coastal ownership, whilst water also provides a source of rich and complex metaphors in wider social life. Describing this coastal water cycle provides the basis for a critique of the way European topographic maps represent coastal space, and also for a critique of common formulations of customary marine tenure (CMT). However as a methodological tool, I use maps to provide a detailed analysis of people's connections to place and as part of a wider examination of how places are generated and sustained. In this way the thesis contributes to anthropology, marine studies, and indigenous studies as well as touching on some issues of coastal geography. The approach I adopt has a phenomenological emphasis, since it enables me to show how Yolngu concepts arise out of and articulate with their experience of living in their environment and of using knowledge in context. This perspective contributes fresh ethnographic insights to some ongoing contemporary debates about people and place. The paired tropes of flow and movement are used as a gloss throughout the work, as each chapter takes a different domain of human life at Yilpara and explores how water, place, and human movement are manifested in it. Such domains include subsistence hunting and fishing, group and gender distinctions in presence on the country, food sharing, memories of residence and travel, personal names, spirits and Dreaming figures, patterns of coastal ownership, and interactions with professional fishermen. Together, they provide an account of the different ways that people relate to water, <b>place</b> <b>and</b> <b>country</b> in contemporary everyday life. ‘Where the Clouds Stand’ is predominantly an ethnographically driven work from one locality, but within that approach, it also explores broader considerations of phenomenology, anthropological inquiry, and human life more generally. ...|$|E
40|$|Many {{people in}} the world today do not receive enough food, and the {{prospects}} for the future are depressing. The deficits in staple foods in the developing countries are likely to be three to four times as great in 1990 as they are today. There is need for more intensive use of soils, but there is already much concern about the deterioration of soils throug- h excessive and unwise use. Agricultural research can contribute significantly to the amelioration of these problems, but because research costs are high and increasing, efforts are needed to make agricultural research more efficient. Many small countries will not have the resources to make the magnitude of research effort needed to solve their own problems. In these dire circumstances, greater efforts need to be made to transfer agricultural technology from place to <b>place</b> <b>and</b> <b>country</b> to country. Presently it is being done mostly by trial and error, but more scientific approaches are being developed. Models that simulate biological processes and regression equations relating crop performance to input and sitefactor variables have great potential but only limited success to date, because of the magnitude of environmental site-factor constraints. Methods of analogous transfer have much greater immediate value. They are widely if casually used. They can be made more useful and more scientific if they are based upon the stratification of resource and environmental constraint variables, particularly of climates and soils. A methodology for systematic, analogous agrotechnology transfer now exists in the combination of soil survey, Soil Taxonomy, the benchmark soils concept, and the methods of soil survey interpretation. Some useful scientific proofs have been made of the transfer methodology over a global soils network, far exceeding in its geographic coverage the current possibilities of simulation or statistical methods. It is easy to see how the number of stations in the network can be increased through an International Benchmark Soils Network. The new methodology opens up the real possibility of technical communication and cooperation among the developing countries. It opens up the real possibility of increasing the efficiency of agronomic research. It opens up the need for countries to know their soils better and to strengthen their programs of soil survey interpretation. It opens up the possibilities for much greater and more effective use of soils information in the planning of agricultural development. An operating network of stations for agrotechnology transfer will not decrease the need for national agricultural research, because there is proof that transfer will not occur in the absence of local research capacity. Research in developed countries and in the international agricultural centers assists the transfer process, but does not replace the need for national research...|$|E
