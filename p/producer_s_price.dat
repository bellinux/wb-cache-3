40|$|In this paper, we {{establish}} {{three new}} facts about price-setting by multi-product firms and contribute {{a model that}} can explain our findings. On the empirical side, using micro-data on U. <b>S.</b> <b>producer</b> <b>prices,</b> we first show that firms selling more goods adjust their prices more frequently but on average by smaller amounts. Moreover, the higher the number of goods, the lower is the fraction of positive price changes and the more dispersed the distribution of price changes. Second, we document substantial synchronization of price changes within firms across products and show that synchronization plays a dominant role in explaining pricing dynamics. Third, we find that within-firm synchronization of price changes increases {{as the number of}} goods increases. On the theoretical side, we present a state-dependent pricing model where multi-product firms face both aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks. When we allow for firm-specific menu costs and trend inflation, the model matches the empirical findings.

In practical applications, it is useful to have a test available with power more robust to the initial condition. In this paper, we propose such a procedure based on a data-dependent weighted average of the standard Dickey [...] Fuller and Elliott [...] Rothenberg [...] Stock tests.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a new methodology {{to estimate the}} effect of low-wage import competition on U. <b>S.</b> <b>producer</b> <b>prices.</b> We first document that when low-wage countries grow, their exports to the United States increase most in labor-intensive sectors. Second, we demonstrate that the temporary and relative component of imports induced by labor intensity and output growth in low-wage countries is orthogonal to U. S. supply and demand shocks and can, therefore, be utilized to identify the causal impact of import competition on prices. In a panel covering 325 manufacturing industries from 1997 to 2006, we find that imports from nine low-wage countries are associated with strong downward pressure on U. <b>S.</b> <b>prices.</b> When these nations capture 1 % U. <b>S.</b> market share, <b>producer</b> <b>prices</b> decrease by 3. 1 %, which is nearly fully accounted by a 2. 4 % increase in labor productivity and a 0. 4 % decrease in markups. Overall, we find that imports from the examined countries have decreased U. S. manufacturing PPI inflation by around two percentage points each year.

Less work has been done trying to test if that monopoly power was actually exercised or not and to what extent. This paper tests empirically the competitive behavior of the US copper industry using the techniques developed by the New Empirical Industrial Organization Literature.

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, {{observers}} increasingly have pointed to China {{as a source of}} downward pressure on global prices. This paper evaluates the theoretical and empirical evidence bearing {{on the question of whether}} China's buoyant export growth has led to significant changes in the inflation performance of its trading partners. This evidence suggests that the impact of Chinese exports on global prices has been, while non-negligible, fairly modest. On a priori grounds, our theoretical analysis suggests that China's economy is still too small relative to the world economy to have much effect on global inflation: a back-of-the-envelope calculation puts that effect at about 1 / 3 percentage point in recent years. In terms of the empirical evidence, we identify a statistically significant effect of U. S. imports from China on U. <b>S.</b> import <b>prices,</b> but given the size of this effect and the relatively low share of imports in U. S. GDP, the ultimate impact on the U. <b>S.</b> consumer <b>prices</b> has likely been quite small. Moreover, imports from China had little apparent effect on U. <b>S.</b> <b>producer</b> <b>prices.</b> Finally, using a multi-country database of trade transactions, we estimate that since 1993, Chinese exports lowered annual import inflation in a large set of economies by 1 / 4 percentage point or less on average, similar to the prediction of our theoretical model.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 40 years economists have devoted {{considerable}} effort to estimating long-run trends in real commodity prices. The {{results indicate that}} the real prices for many commodities have fallen, suggesting to the surprise of many that resource scarcity is declining over time. Almost all of this work, however, uses the U. <b>S.</b> <b>producer</b> <b>price</b> index or other standard price deflators, which recent research shows overestimate inflation for several reasons. This article examines copper prices with adjusted deflators designed to eliminate this bias. It finds that the trend over time, which is significantly downward when no adjustment is made to the deflator, displays no tendency in either direction or is significantly upward depending on the magnitude of the deflator adjustment employed. These findings suggest that real resource prices provide less support than widely assumed for the hypothesis that resources are becoming more available or less scarce over time. resources; copper; real price; inflation bias; scarcity...|$|R
40|$|While {{the long}} term trend in U. S. {{production}} has been downward, increased imports have been supplying the upward trend in U. S. honey consumption. Exceptionally high producer level prices during 1996 and 1997 were apparently due to lower world supplies, particularly as reflected in stocks. The recent large increases in imports and, to a lesser extent, stocks led to the softening in U. <b>S.</b> <b>producer</b> <b>prices</b> in 1997 while retail prices and margins remained firm. U. S. retail poundage sales, based on Nielsen data, remained robust, dropping only slightly {{in the face of}} a 40 % increase in retail price between 1995 and 1997. The producer price for honey in 1998 will depend largely on three factors: (1) U. S. honey producers' response in terms of honey production, (2) the management of stocks in response to price expectations, and (3) the role of imports as part of total U. S. honey supply.

40|$|Research PaperRecent {{increases}} in imports of catfish and crawfish have caused concern {{as to their}} impact on domestic prices. This study identifies the linkages between imports of these goods and U. <b>S.</b> <b>producer</b> <b>prices.</b> Increases in imports of catfish are shown to decrease related domestic prices. However, recent trends show a simultaneous increase in both imports and domestic prices of crawfish. An increase in consumer income also typically indicates a corresponding increase in the demand for catfish and crawfish. This study also showed that {{an increase in the}} supply of trout, clams, and chicken caused the domestic price of catfish to decrease, and an increase in the supply of pork generated a decrease in the domestic price of crawfish. The models showed different relationships between domestic prices of these goods and other aquaculture and meat products. In addition, the reciprocal of the direct elasticity is not always a good approximation of the direct flexibility because of the stochastic properties of the econometric model. As a result, it is not proper to use the indirect price flexibility from inverted direct price elasticity with other variables for catfish and crawfish...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{structural changes}} and the dynamics of price relationships in the U. S., British Columbia, Quebec and Ontario lumber markets. With monthly price series from 1981 to 2002, we use Perron’s method to identify structural shifts and the Johansen cointegration analysis and vector-error correction (VEC) model to determine both short-run and long-run price relationships. We find that, due to restrictions on federal timber harvests in the Pacific Northwest (PNW), price instability experienced in 1992 has caused structural shifts for the U. S. and Canadian lumber prices. We also find that the North American lumber market is indeed integrated where the U. <b>S.</b> <b>price</b> significantly affects Canadian prices in both short-run and long-run. This result indicates the price leadership role for the U. S. in the North American lumber market where the Canadian prices respond to the U. <b>S.</b> <b>price</b> change, but that the reverse does not hold. Therefore, this finding may not support the claim of U. <b>S.</b> <b>producers</b> that subsidized Canadian lumber has depressed the U. <b>S.</b> <b>price</b> and harmed the U.

40|$|When labor {{abundant}} nations grow, their exports increase more {{in labor}} intensive than in capital intensive sectors. We utilize {{this difference in}} how exports are affected by growth to identify the causal effect of trade with low-income countries (LICs) on U. S. industry. Our framework relates differences in sectoral inflation rates to differences in comparative advantage-induced import growth rates and abstracts from aggregate fluctuations and sector specific trends. In a panel covering 325 six-digit NAICS manufacturing industries from 1997 to 2006, we find that LIC exports are associated with strong downward pressure on U. <b>S.</b> <b>producer</b> <b>prices</b> and a large effect on productivity. When LIC exporters capture 1 % U. <b>S.</b> market share <b>producer</b> <b>prices</b> decrease by 3 %, which is nearly fully accounted by a 2. 4 % increase in productivity and a 0. 3 % decrease in markups. We also document that while LICs on average {{find it easier to}} penetrate sectors with elastic demand, the price and productivity response to import competition is much stronger in industries with inelastic demand. Overall, between 1997 and 2006, the effect of LIC trade on manufacturing PPI inflation was around two percentage points per year, far too large to be neglected in macroeconomic analysis. comparative advantage; globalization; low-wage country import competition...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to analyze the factors causing an increase in wheat imports from Canada and to estimate the effect of increased wheat imports on U. <b>S.</b> <b>prices</b> and farm income. An econometric model is developed and estimated to determine these factors and effects. Canadian exports to the United States are estimated as a function of U. <b>S.</b> <b>price,</b> the U. <b>S.</b> - Canada exchange rate, and other variables, while U. <b>S.</b> <b>price</b> is estimated as a function of imports from Canada, U. S. domestic supply and consumption, and exports. The two equations are estimated simultaneously. Results from this model are used to estimate the effect of imports from Canada on U. <b>S.</b> farm <b>prices</b> and income. Results indicate that imports from Canada have a significant negative effect on U. S. hard red spring and durum wheat prices and consequently decrease farm income for U. <b>S.</b> <b>producers.</b> However, while the effect is significant, it is still {{only a small portion of}} the total decrease in price in recent years. Some portion of the increased wheat imports is due to the elimination of import restrictions under the Canada - U. S.

40|$|Import {{prices in}} the U. S. have not responded as {{expected}} to large fluctuations in the exchange rate. This paper analyzes the response of Japanese and U. <b>S.</b> steel <b>prices</b> {{to changes in the}} yen-dollar exchange rate (the exchange rate pass-through, or percentage change in import prices as a result of changes in the exchange rate or the exporter's cost of production). It concludes that: (a) the magnitude of elasticity of the pass-through depends on the elasticity of import demand, the convexity of the demand curve, and the elasticity of the marginal cost of production output; (b) in a competitive pricing market the pass-through is equal to 1 only if marginal costs are constant; (c) if marginal costs are increasing, the pass-through is less than 1; (d) the pass-through can be greater than 1 for both competitive and noncompetitive pricing markets if marginal costs are declining and the import demand curve is very convex; (e) if marginal costs are declining fast enough when production is increasing, the pass-through can be greater than 1 even if the demand curve is not convex; and (f) the yen-dollar exchange rate is not fully passed through in steel prices. When the exchange rate changes, both U. S. and Japanese steel <b>prices</b> change; U. <b>S.</b> <b>producers</b> adjust <b>prices</b> immediately, whereas Japanese are conservative. One implication is that devaluation may lead to a shift of resources within the export sector, from higher pass-through sectors to lower pass-through sectors.

40|$|Version of RecordThis paper {{analyzes}} {{the behavior of}} U. S. PPI over the period January 1913 to March 2004 using monthly “all commodities index” values. The mean of monthly percentage index changes for the entire data set (0. 23 %) was significantly greater than zero. January, July and November had mean monthly percentage changes which were significantly greater than the mean changes of the other months over the entire period. March, May and September had mean percentage changes {{significantly lower than the}} other months. We find that there is some periodicity to all commodities index. The mean of monthly commodities index changes during the Republican presidencies (0. 08 %) was significantly lower than the mean changes during the Democratic presidencies (0. 38 %) and so were the medians. We slice the entire data into three sub-periods. We find that though the means and medians have significantly increased over the three sub-periods, the standard deviations of the means have decreased. Granger causality tests reveal that while oil prices affected the all commodities index and the finished goods index, the causal relationship is not true the other way at the 99 % significance level.
