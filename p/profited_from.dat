5|$|Being {{in control}} of highly {{important}} commercial centers, his principality <b>profited</b> <b>from</b> taxing the major trading routes running through southwestern Caucasus and eastern Anatolia. David invested these revenues in extensive building projects: constructing towns, forts and churches, and promoting Georgian monastic communities and cultural activities both in Georgia and abroad.|$|E
5|$|Twentieth Century Fox <b>profited</b> <b>from</b> Monroe's {{popularity}} by cultivating several lookalike actresses {{that included}} Jayne Mansfield and Sheree North.

5|$|The Normans {{retained}} {{and reinforced}} the manorial system with its division between demesne and peasant lands paid for in agricultural labour. Landowners could {{profit from the}} sales of goods from their demesne lands and a local lord could also expect to receive income from fines and local customs, whilst more powerful nobles <b>profited</b> <b>from</b> their own regional courts and rights.|$|E
5000|$|Propination {{laws were}} a {{privilege}} granted to Polish szlachta that gave landowners a monopoly over <b>profits</b> <b>from</b> alcohol drank by peasants they owned. In many cases, <b>profits</b> <b>from</b> propination exceeded those from agricultural production or other sources.|$|R
30|$|The <b>profit</b> derived <b>from</b> farming {{systems is}} equal to the {{opportunity}} cost of converting agricultural or pastoral lands to forest, thereby reducing turbidity. For example low OCs are associated with low <b>profits</b> <b>from</b> current land use. Per hectare OC estimates for each sub-watershed thus represent the weighted average per hectare <b>profits</b> <b>from</b> the respective land cover types.|$|R
40|$|In {{exploring}} why innovators {{often do}} not <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> their innovations, researchers concentrate on innovators versus imitators {{and the extent to}} which owners of complementary assets capture <b>profits</b> <b>from</b> innovations. The literature provides scant attention to factors that sap <b>profits</b> <b>from</b> innovations. This paper argues that an innovator's positioning vis-à-vis customers, suppliers, complementors, and other co-opetitors plays a critical role in the innovator's profitability. The article explores how an innovator can use new game strategies to better positioning, thus capturing rents from innovations and enabling further innovations in the future. The study examines the case of Lipitor, one of the world's best-selling drug, to illustrate how positioning can play in a firm's ability to <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> its innovations...|$|R
5|$|The {{national}} debt increased {{as a result}} during Hamilton's service as Secretary of the Treasury, but the nation established its good credit. Many in the Congress {{and elsewhere in the}} government <b>profited</b> <b>from</b> trading in the debt paper which was assumed. Many of Washington's fellow Virginians and others were vexed by this, but he considered that they had adequate redress through their Congressional representatives.|$|E
5|$|Anne's {{family also}} <b>profited</b> <b>from</b> the relationship. Her father, already Viscount Rochford, was created Earl of Wiltshire. Henry {{also came to}} an {{arrangement}} with Anne's Irish cousin and created him Earl of Ormond. At the magnificent banquet to celebrate her father's elevation, Anne took precedence over the Duchesses of Suffolk and Norfolk, seated {{in the place of}} honour beside the King which was usually occupied by the Queen. Thanks to Anne's intervention, her widowed sister Mary received an annual pension of £100, and Mary's son, Henry Carey, was educated at a prestigious Cistercian monastery.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal <b>profited</b> <b>from</b> {{a mistake}} Sheffield Wednesday goalkeeper Martin Hodge to {{progress}} to the semi-finals, {{where they were}} paired up against Everton. The first leg was staged at Goodison Park and saw the Arsenal players, rejuvenated by a five-day break in Marbella, come away with a 1–0 win. Groves scored the only goal of the match when {{he managed to get}} a shot in from Kenny Sansom's free kick. Arsenal secured a place in the final with a 3–1 victory in the second leg.|$|E

30|$|Our surveys {{indicated}} that the <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> potatoes is 18, 000  yuan/ha, and the <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> scallions is 67, 500  yuan/ha. A farmer wanting to adopt the conversion plan would incur 14, 400  yuan in opportunity costs according to the designed rule described in Farmers’ Intention. However, the <b>profit</b> <b>from</b> scallions is 27, 000  yuan. Therefore, even if the opportunity cost was incurred before the maturation of the scallions, the farmer would still earn 12, 600  yuan. This reasoning explains why the conversion cost is not considered in the farmer household decision making model.|$|R
5|$|At its root, {{the peasant}} war of 1653 {{was caused by}} the rapidly {{changing}} economic circumstances {{after the end of the}} Thirty Years' War. The Swiss Confederacy had been spared from all belligerent action; the Swiss peasants generally had <b>profited</b> <b>from</b> the wartime economy as they had been able to export their agrarian products at higher prices than before. After the Peace of Westphalia, the southern German economy recovered quickly, the Swiss exports dwindled, and the prices for agrarian products dropped. Many Swiss peasants, who had raised mortgages during the boom at wartime, suddenly faced financial problems.|$|E
5|$|Breeding densities {{have been}} {{recorded}} as between 0.1–6.6pairs/10ha (0.04–2.7pairs/10acres), with the greatest densities in mature forest growing on alluvium. Numbers have increased in Europe due to the planting of forests, which provides breeding habitat, and more available dead wood, and this species has <b>profited</b> <b>from</b> its flexibility with regard to types of woodland {{and its ability to}} thrive in proximity to humans. Harsh winters are a problem, and fragmentation of woodland can cause local difficulties. The Canary Islands populations of D. m. canariensis on Tenerife and D. m. thanneri on Gran Canaria face a potential threat from exploitation of the local pine forests.|$|E
5|$|Edward married Wallis in France on 3 June 1937. She {{became the}} Duchess of Windsor, but, much to Edward's disgust, George VI issued letters patent that denied her {{the style of}} Her Royal Highness. The couple settled in France, and the Duke {{received}} a tax-free allowance from his brother, which Edward supplemented by writing his memoirs and by illegal currency trading. He also <b>profited</b> <b>from</b> the sale of Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House to George VI. Both estates are private property and {{not part of the}} Royal Estate, and were therefore inherited and owned by Edward, regardless of the abdication.|$|E

5|$|With {{support from}} California (because {{the state had}} <b>profited</b> <b>from</b> the import of sugar), Kalākaua again {{approached}} Congress. When the United States still seemed uninterested in reciprocity, he threatened to forge more favorable export agreements with Australia or New Zealand. Congress feared that a treaty between Hawaii and Australia or New Zealand would result in annexation by one of those countries instead of the United States. Although Kalākaua was loath to give any foreign country land in Hawaii, he signed the treaty in September 1887.|$|E
5|$|Around 2 p.m., the Confederate Second Corps {{divisions}} of Maj. Gens. Robert E. Rodes and Jubal Early assaulted and out-flanked the Union I and XI Corps positions north and northwest of town. The Confederate brigades of Col. Edward A. O'Neal and Brig. Gen. Alfred Iverson suffered severe losses assaulting the I Corps division of Brig. Gen. John C. Robinson south of Oak Hill. Early's division <b>profited</b> <b>from</b> a blunder by Brig. Gen. Francis C. Barlow, when he advanced his XI Corps division to Blocher's Knoll (directly {{north of town}} and now known as Barlow's Knoll); this represented a salient in the corps line, susceptible to attack from multiple sides, and Early's troops overran Barlow's division, which constituted the right flank of the Union Army's position. Barlow was wounded and captured in the attack.|$|E
5|$|By then, Exton had in turn {{been elected}} Mayor. Although {{for a while}} he and Brembre worked {{together}} in running London, when his predecessor fell from influence, Exton effectively deserted him, {{even to the point of}} being partially responsible for Brembre's eventual hanging. Exton's primary policy throughout his two periods as Mayor was probably based on a desire to maintain the city's neutrality between the feuding parties. On the other hand, he appears to have personally <b>profited</b> <b>from</b> the Appellants' period of rule, and it seems that there was some dissatisfaction with him in London, even if he was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing by parliament. His later years are as obscure as his youth; known to have married at least twice, he seems to have had no children, and died in 1402 at an unknown age.|$|E

5|$|Strong, royalty-based {{nation states}} rose {{throughout}} Europe in the Late Middle Ages, particularly in England, France, and the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula: Aragon, Castile, and Portugal. The long conflicts {{of the period}} strengthened royal control over their kingdoms and were extremely hard on the peasantry. Kings <b>profited</b> <b>from</b> warfare that extended royal legislation and increased the lands they directly controlled. Paying for the wars required that methods of taxation become more effective and efficient, {{and the rate of}} taxation often increased. The requirement to obtain the consent of taxpayers allowed representative bodies such as the English Parliament and the French Estates General to gain power and authority.|$|E
5|$|Washbrook {{reached his}} century with the score on 189/1; he reached triple figures {{half an hour}} after tea, having batted for 230 minutes and 16 boundaries. Washbrook avoided cross-batted shots and solidly defended shorter balls from the back foot, and <b>profited</b> <b>from</b> many over-pitched balls, which he drove away for boundaries. It was a welcome return to form for the opener from Lancashire. He had scored six, one, eight, 37 and 11 in his first five innings of the series, and was dropped on 21 in the second innings of the Third Test before {{proceeding}} to an unbeaten 85. After reaching his century, Washbrook began to play more expansively, driving {{in a manner that}} prompted Arlott to compare him to Frank Woolley.|$|E
5|$|Lumber mills, {{originally}} {{built to}} provide construction-grade materials for homes and business but then expanded to entice and then {{meet the demands}} of the railroad, <b>profited</b> <b>from</b> an increase in demand from railroad expansion and the nation at large. The Bonner mill, owned the NorthernPacific and CopperKing MarcusDaly, became the largest producer of lumber in the northwest. In 1908, Missoula's location as both a major lumber producer and a regional commercial center helped land the city the regional office for the newly establish U.S. Forest Service created to help manage the nation's timber supply. Over the next century, Missoula's various lumber industries was consolidated under various entities such as the Anaconda Company in the 1970s and Champion International Paper through the 1980s until most were under control of Plum Creek Timber, all the while demand in timber dropped. In 2007, a downward spiral of Missoula's lumber industry began with the closure of a plywood plant in Bonner, the closure of Bonner's sawmill in 2008, and the closing of the Smurfit-Stone Container pulp mill in 2010.|$|E

5|$|Nabis drafted 10,000 {{citizens}} {{into his}} army and hired 3,000 additional mercenaries. Nabis' Cretan allies, who <b>profited</b> <b>from</b> the naval bases on his territory, dispatched 1,000 specially selected warriors {{to augment the}} 1,000 they had already sent to Sparta's aid. Nabis, fearing that the Roman approach might encourage his subjects to revolt, decided to terrorize them by ordering the execution of eighty prominent citizens. Flamininus left his base and descended upon Sellasia; while the Romans were making camp, Nabis' auxiliaries attacked them. The sudden surprise attack briefly threw the allies {{into a state of}} confusion, but the Spartans retreated back to the city when the main body of legionary cohorts arrived. As the Romans marched past Sparta on their way to Mount Menelaus, Nabis' mercenaries attacked the allies' rear. Appius Claudius, commander of the rearguard, rallied his troops and forced the mercenaries to retreat behind the city's walls, inflicting heavy casualties on them in the process.|$|E
5|$|The SS owned {{experimental}} farms, bakeries, meat packing plants, leather works, {{clothing and}} uniform factories, and small arms factories. Under {{the direction of}} the WVHA, the SS sold camp labor to various factories at a rate of three to six Reichsmarks per prisoner per day. The SS confiscated and sold the property of concentration camp inmates, confiscated their investment portfolios and their cash, and <b>profited</b> <b>from</b> their dead bodies by selling their hair to make felt and melting down their dental work to obtain gold from the fillings. The total value of assets looted from the victims of Operation Reinhard alone (not including Auschwitz) was listed by Odilo Globocnik as 178,745,960.59 Reichsmarks. Items seized included 2,909.68 kilograms of gold worth 843,802.75 RM, as well as 18,733.69kg of silver, 1,514kg of platinum, 249,771.50 American dollars, 130 diamond solitaires, 2,511.87 carats of brilliants, 13,458.62 carats of diamonds, and 114kg of pearls. According to Nazi legislation, Jewish property belonged to the state, but many SS camp commandants and guards stole items such as diamonds or currency for personal gain, or took seized foodstuffs and liquor to sell on the black market.|$|E
5|$|During the 1840s and 1850s, {{a flurry}} of railroad-building {{activity}} led to the completion of four separate railroads converging in Erie. A break of gauge between the the Erie and North East Railroad and the Franklin Canal Companyensured that the citizens of Erie <b>profited</b> <b>from</b> the delays necessary to transfer cargo between the lines. When it was proposed in 1853 to standardize the track gauge to allow through traffic, a conflict that {{became known as the}} Erie Gauge War ensued. The residents of Erie, who saw it as an affront to their desire that the city become a major lake port, dismantled railroad bridges and tore up railroad tracks in the city in an effort to prevent the impending standardization. As part of the dispute's settlement, both railroads provided financial support for the construction of the Erie and Pittsburgh and Sunbury and Erie railroads. The Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad acquired the Franklin Canal Company in 1854, and the Erie and North East was merged with the Buffalo and State Line to form the Buffalo and Erie Railroad a few years later. The Sunbury and Erie was renamed the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad in 1861. The Pennsylvania Railroad soon acquired the Sunbury and Erie through a 999-year lease and funded completion of the line by 1864.|$|E
