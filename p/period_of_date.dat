40|$|The annual palm date {{production}} in Saudi Arabia approached 800 thousands tons in 2004. One {{of the most}} important processes in the date industry is fumigation which is based in chemical treatment to destroy insects. Previous studies indicate that insects are very sensitive to temperature rise and can be destroyed instantly if exposed to MOe. The harvesting <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>date</b> fruits in the Riyadh region of Saudi Arabia extends from June till the beginning of September. During the summer months, the standard day temperature in the Riyadh area ranges from 35 to 45 °e. Therefore, this study is an attempt to develop a procedure to utilize the solar energy to destroy date insects as an alternative method to the fumigation process. Thus, the goal of this research was to study the heat penetration curves of solar energy into three varieties of date fruits (Sefri, Seri and Khudari). Temperatures of three locations were recorded during solar exposure (inside the date fruits, inside the solar collector and the surrounding atmosphere temperature). Mathematical models were developed for the heating curves. Fruit color and moisture content before and after solar heating were determined as quality parameters. The heat penetration rates and quality parameters depend on the date variety as well as the surrounding temperature. Kinetic models were applied to indicate the effectiveness of solar energy in the destruction of Oryzaephilus surinamensis: Silvanidae insects inside date fruits. Modeling results indicate that solar energy can be used to destroy the insects with little change of date quality...|$|E

50|$|According to {{research}} undertaken during the restoration, the inner structure {{that served as}} the foundation for the restoration dates to the mid-to-late 1860s. The nails used to hold the weatherboarding in place may be dated at approximately 1830 to 1890. This siding contained vertical saw marks which were uniform indicating the use of an up and down action power saw which may have been water powered. This would date the siding at about 1830 to about 1860—prior to circular saw use for the area. The structural framing details also fit this <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>dating,</b> about 1830 to 1860.

[...] Diggler is an unhappily divorced father of a [...] "round son," [...] Colby, over whom he is locked in a never-ending custody battle with his ex-wife, only called Ex-Mrs. The Dig.

It is also often implied that Diggler is a sex addict, with the character unwittingly making references to his foot fetish and interest in sex tourism and camgirls. In search of love, Diggler briefly dates a feminist NYU student referred to by her Tumblr handle, KweenTrashWytch✨✨ (including the two sparkle emoji).
