40|$|Application of Hydraulic Power {{technology}} in world industry today is still continue to increased. Not only in Industrial it’s self, but in  Marine, Onshore and Offshore also use these technologies. Requirement {{of service in}} well services - Offshore Delta Mahakam region makes PT. Halliburton Indonesia as a Service Company increase his fleet service. The Type Stimulation Vessel Fleets - Stim Star Borneo is planned to improve the service unit of High Rate Water Pack (HRWP) with High Pressure Pump unit plus Gravel Pack Sand (GP) and High Rate Blender Unit. Blender High Rate is a unit tubular mixing blender driven by hydraulic power, motors blender, sand screw, pump suction and discharge pump that’s is installed unity. For that The authors will plan  system, calculation and specifications of Hydraulic <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> <b>Unit</b> for High Rate the Blender. Calculations start from of Operasional Requirement Conditions, and continued with Design Block Diagram, P & ID, and also calculations of systems such as Head, RPM, Pipe Diamater, Pipe Thickness, Main Hydraulic Pump, Reservoir Tank and Cooler. Where The Requirement of Hydraulic Main Pump Power is 950 kW with Electric Motor as prime mover 950 kW. The final result of the design is show as Layout and Detail drawing in attachment. </div...|$|E
40|$|A {{design of}} a hydraulic-based gate-lifting system for the gates of Sennar dam is presented, to {{supersede}} the existing aging mechanical system. The system summarized in three groups; the <b>power</b> <b>pack</b> <b>unit</b> which including electric motors, hydraulic pumps, oil reservoirs, and control valves, the control group including directional and pressure control valves and the actuation group including hydraulic cylinders and hydraulic motors. A brief history of Sennar dam was given, describing the present operating methods; the dam gates and the spillway gates operated by diesel cranes and the two canal gates Gezira and Managil operated manually. Photos attached showing dam profile and its operation methods. Because of problems arising from gates operation like increase of operation cost and the many faults for the existing old system, an idea emerged to have a modern new operating system to stop or reduce the operating problems. The best choice was a hydraulic system. A design was carried out for raising and lowering the dam main sluice gates, including hydraulic cylinders for the main dam sluice gates and spillway gates, hydraulic motors for the Gezira and Managil gates and hydraulic pumps with all attachments like hoses, pipes, oil reservoirs, and valves etc [...] . A study of hydraulic system control techniques is included. This study showed the high technique of the suggested system with respect to operation, accuracy, quality, speed and running cost. A cost analysis and comparison between both systems, namely, the hydraulic system and the mechanical/manual system were carried out. That showed the importance of use this suggested system for Sennar dam gates operation...|$|E
50|$|A <b>power</b> <b>pack</b> is a <b>unit</b> {{attached}} to the ANF’s agitator system. It consists of an oil tank on which a pump is provided for circulating high-pressure oil through a control valve system and to hydraulic cylinders. These cylinders are provided for vertical movement of the agitator. Operating pressure of the oil varies from 2 kg/cm² to 80 kg/cm² (200 kPa to 8 MPa).|$|R

50|$|An annular blowout {{preventer}} uses {{the principle of}} a wedge to shut in the wellbore. It has a donut-like rubber seal, known as an elastomeric <b>packing</b> <b>unit,</b> reinforced with steel ribs. The <b>packing</b> <b>unit</b> is situated in the BOP housing between the head and hydraulic piston. When the piston is actuated, its upward thrust forces the <b>packing</b> <b>unit</b> to constrict, like a sphincter, sealing the annulus or openhole. Annular preventers have only two moving parts, piston and <b>packing</b> <b>unit,</b> making them simple and easy to maintain relative to ram preventers.|$|R

Energy is transferred to the Casing Rotor through the engine inside the <b>Power</b> <b>Pack.</b> In this study, the generated noise of a <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> was predicted, to provide {{suggestions on how to}} improve the noise level. First, we constructed a 3 D model of the <b>Power</b> <b>Pack.</b> A finite element analysis was performed using ANSYS.

50|$|Trash is {{a street}} gang {{made up of}} superhuman mutant youths, and it was {{originally}} employed by an older mutant drug kingpin named the Garbage Man. The original lineup of Trash included Airhead, Blasting Cap, Brute, Crazy Legs, and Razor Cut. The Garbage Man employed the gang to run drugs to his various crackhouses. On one such mission, Trash encountered and fought <b>Power</b> <b>Pack.</b> Trash allowed the young heroes to follow {{them back to the}} Garbage Man’s headquarters, hoping to trap them. Trash and Garbage Man beat and captured <b>Power</b> <b>Pack,</b> and Garbage Man ordered the gang to kill the members of <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> with a lethal overdose of drugs. When Trash refused, they were forced to fight their criminal employer, and they freed <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> to help. Blasting Cap blew up the Garbage Man’s warehouse, but the members of Trash assumed that he had escaped and would find them later. Despite a hefty admonishing by <b>Power</b> <b>Pack,</b> and scarred by their bad experiences with society as they were, Trash surmised that becoming heroes like <b>Power</b> <b>Pack</b> was no option for them.|$|R

30|$|Following the {{occurrence}} of bovine spongiform encephalopathy cases in cattle, Japan established a traceability system for beef (Food Rink News 2003). Compared with cattle, eels are small and cannot be sold separately, {{making it difficult to}} establish traceability for every individual fish. However, it is possible to attach a traceable RFID chip to every <b>packed</b> <b>unit</b> of eel. Each <b>packed</b> <b>unit</b> of eel exported to the Japanese market weighs 20  kg, and every 20  kg package carries a traceable RFID chip. The cost of a piece of RFID chip is 20 NT$. The price of eel is unstable and keeps changing. It can range from 200 NT$ to 600 NT$ per kg. The price of a <b>packed</b> <b>unit</b> (20  kg) can range from 4, 000 NT$ to 12, 000 NT$. If an RFID chip is attached to every <b>packed</b> <b>unit,</b> the cost will increase by about 0.5 % when the price of a <b>packed</b> <b>unit</b> is 4, 000 NT$, and the cost will increase by about 0.17 % when the price of a <b>packed</b> <b>unit</b> is 12, 000 NT$. For eel farmers and exporters, costs will slightly increase, but this extra cost is justified by the ease of traceability. RFID aside, eel farmers should keep records of their production process and the materials they use during production, as these are helpful in setting up a proper traceability system.|$|R
