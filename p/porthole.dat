5|$|The station {{provided}} two permanent crew quarters, the Kayutkas, phonebox-sized booths set {{towards the}} rear of the core module, each featuring a tethered sleeping bag, a fold-out desk, a <b>porthole,</b> and storage for personal effects. Visiting crews had no allocated sleep module, instead attaching a sleeping bag to an available space on a wall; US astronauts installed themselves within Spektr until a collision with a Progress spacecraft caused the depressurisation of that module. It was important that crew accommodations be well ventilated; otherwise, astronauts could wake up oxygen-deprived and gasping for air, because a bubble of their own exhaled carbon dioxide had formed around their heads.|$|E
5|$|The Danebod Lutheran Church (also {{known as}} the Cross Church at Danebod) was {{dedicated}} Sunday, June 16, 1895. It is a cruciform clapboard building with a square placed obliquely in the center. The tower in the middle is carried at a 45 degree angle to {{the arms of the}} cross. The outside and interior detailing of the church is Eastlake. It was built largely with volunteer labor and money pledged by the early settlers, who had little to give. Points of interest include the altar chairs, kerosene lamps, architectural structure, wainscoting walls and ceiling, <b>porthole</b> windows as in a ship, hand-carving on the altar, pulpit and railing, the candelabra and altar cloth, hand-carved stone baptismal font, the Star of Bethlehem in the ceiling, Bertel Thorvaldsen's statue of Christ, the Celtic cross, and pictures in the narthex. The church is located at 101 Danebod Court. The church was established by the organization that later became the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (DELCA). This organization later merged into the Lutheran Church in America (LCA) in 1962 and then into the largest Lutheran church in the U.S. in 1988: the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA). Danebod Lutheran Church remains a part of the ELCA still today.|$|E
5|$|The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour is {{a parody}} of the 1960s and 1970s live variety shows. Mainly it is {{a parody of}} The Brady Bunch Hour, a {{short-lived}} spin-off of the 1970s sitcom The Brady Bunch. The replacement of Lisa in the third segment with another girl reflects the recasting of Jan Brady in the Brady Bunch Hour when Eve Plumb refused to participate. The Simpson family is {{made to look like}} The Partridge Family. Also, the segment holds numerous references to Laugh-In. Kent Brockman introduces the show from inside a broadcast booth in a style similar to Laugh-In, there is a joke wall similar to the one in Laugh-In where The Sea Captain opens a <b>porthole.</b> There is also a Laugh-In-like montage wherein other characters comment on the skit itself. When Hans Moleman reads a poem, it is based on Henry Gibson reading a poem on Laugh-In. Other shows parodied during the variety show include The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour, and The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.|$|E
50|$|Ultimately, {{the swift}} sinking and immense {{loss of life}} can be {{attributed}} to three factors: the location in which Storstad made contact, failure to close Empress of Irelands watertight doors, and longitudinal bulkheads that exacerbated the list by inhibiting cross flooding. A contributing factor were open <b>portholes.</b> Surviving passengers and crew testified that some upper <b>portholes</b> were left open for ventilation. The maritime Safety of Life at Sea regulations require openable <b>portholes</b> to be closed and locked before leaving port, but <b>portholes</b> were often left open in sheltered waters like the St. Lawrence River where heavy seas were not expected. When Empress of Ireland began to list to starboard, water poured through the open <b>portholes</b> further increasing flooding.|$|R

Others responded that making <b>portholes</b> larger would be cost-prohibitive, or come at the expense of structural strength. In the end, regulations required <b>portholes</b> to be big enough for a person of reasonable size to escape.|$|R

After the casing is inserted into the ground, the inner sleeve is rotated such that the windows on the sleeve and casing line up exposing the soil {{to a variety of}} investigative probes. A tab or wiper is attached to the inner sleeve to clear soil blocking the <b>portholes</b> in the casing and to cut through the 2 ̆ 2 smear 2 ̆ 2 zone immediately along side of the outer surface of the casing. Once the sampler casing is in the ground and <b>portholes</b> are open, a sampling probe is inserted into the interior cavity of the casing following a track or guide system. When soil characterization is complete, the <b>portholes</b> can be closed off by turning the inner sleeve and capping the casing for future analyses, or the interior cavity may be filled with grout. The sampler casing is not intended to be removed unless the area is excavated...|$|R
50|$|Recently {{there has}} been a {{decline in the number of}} <b>portholes</b> on larger ships.

25|$|The year of 1971 {{was vital}} to VAM as it {{represented}} a complete turn {{around for the}} company. The new Camioneta Rambler American based on the Hornet Sportabout was introduced, the Rambler Classic obtained all characteristics of AMC's new Matador, and the Javelin was restyled as a new generation. On the outside, the car was {{exactly the same as}} its AMC counterpart with the only exception of the wheels and the lack of factory stripes and decals. A unique characteristic of the second generation VAM Javelin was round <b>porthole</b> opera windows mounted on the C-pillars installed by some VAM dealerships either with or without vinyl roofs.|$|E
25|$|Many {{witnesses}} {{testified that}} portholes across {{the ship had}} been open {{at the time of}} the sinking, and an expert witness confirmed that such a <b>porthole</b> three feet under water would let in four tons of water per minute. Testimony varied on how many torpedoes there had been, and whether the strike occurred between the first and second funnel, or third and fourth. The nature of the official cargo was considered, but experts considered that under no conditions could the cargo have exploded. A record exists that Crewman Jack Roper wrote to Cunard in 1919 requesting expenses for his testimony in accord with the line indicated by Cunard.|$|E
25|$|In India, Ganesh Savarkar had {{organised}} {{an armed}} {{revolt against the}} Morley-Minto reforms of 1909. The British police implicated Savarkar in the investigation for allegedly plotting the crime. Hoping to evade arrest, Savarkar moved to Madame Cama's home in Paris. He was nevertheless arrested by police on 13 March 1910. In {{the final days of}} freedom, Savarkar wrote letters to a close friend planning his escape. Knowing that he would most likely be shipped to India, Savarkar asked his friend to keep track of which ship and route he would be taken through. When the ship SS Morea reached the port of Marseille on 8 July 1910, Savarkar escaped from his cell through a <b>porthole</b> and dived into the water, swimming to the shore in the hope that his friend would be there to receive him in a car. But his friend was late in arriving, and the alarm having been raised, Savarkar was re-arrested.|$|E

50|$|<b>Portholes</b> on {{submarines}} {{are generally}} made of acrylic plastic. In {{the case of}} deep diving submarines, the <b>portholes</b> can be several inches thick. The edge of the acrylic is usually conically tapered such that the external pressure forces the acrylic window against the seat. Usually such windows are flat rather than spherically dished. This decreases the area that can be viewed, but eliminates distortion associated with curved glass.|$|R
25|$|The central {{standing}} 'foreground' {{figure is}} shown affectionately holding {{in both hands}} a blue bird (thus {{the title of the}} painting). The reclining figure wearing a necklace shown in the lower center of the canvas is placed next to a pedestal fruit bowl and another bird with the unmistakable coloration of the rare Scarlet ibis (L'Ibis rouge), a rich symbol for both exoticism and fashion. Costume designers for Parisian cabarets such as Le Lido, Folies Bergère, the Moulin Rouge and haute couture houses in Paris during the 1910s used the feathers of the scarlet Ibis in their shows and collections. The Ibis is a bird to which the ancient Egyptians paid religious worship and attributed to it a 'virgin purity'. A mysterious pyramidal shape is seen as if through a <b>porthole</b> {{to the right of the}} reclining figure's head, though it remains a matter of speculation whether there exists any relation to the ibis or pyramids of ancient Egypt. In front of the pyramid appears a shape that resembles a sundial, perhaps meant as the element of time, or 'duration', as the clock placed in the upper right hand corner of his Nude of 1910.|$|E
25|$|The Street family {{considered}} Harrison a skyscraper architect, so {{his decision}} to both plan and supervise the construction of their house in Scarborough, a hamlet of the village of Briarcliff Manor, surprised them. By October 6, 1937, the house that Harrison constructed had one story of stone {{in the shape of}} an L, with a short stone wall extending {{from the back of the}} house, and a ramp path with a serpentine wall running up along the front of the house to the entrance. By March 7, 1938, the two-story house was completed. The finished house was built of local fieldstone in the shape of an L, using steel beams on the roofs of the house and garage, with sixteen-inch walls, glass <b>porthole</b> windows, and large panes of glass and doors on the back of the house—it was related in design to other early Modernist houses constructed in the late 1930s by the Modernists Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer. Breuer was a proponent of the more modern International Style, and Gropius, as Director of the Bauhaus in Germany, applied the International Style when he designed the school's faculty housing and building around 1925-1926. Gropius and Breuer represented a new form of architectural design, one that did not look to the past, but rather to modern industry for inspiration.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{our experiences}} with the design, implementation, deployment, and evaluation of a <b>Portholes</b> tool which provides group and collaboration awareness through the Web. The research objective was to explore how such a system would improve communication and facilitate a shared understanding among distributed development groups. During the deployment of our <b>Portholes</b> system, we conducted a naturalistic study by soliciting user feedback and evolving the system in response. Many of the initial reactions of potential users indicated that our system projected the wrong image so that we designed a new version that provided explicit cues about being in public and who is looking back to suggest a social rather than information interface. We implemented the new design as a Java applet and evaluated design choices with a preference study. Our experiences with different <b>Portholes</b> versions and user reactions to them provide insights for designing awareness tools beyond <b>Portholes</b> systems. Our approach is for the studies to guide and to provide feedback for the design and technical development of our system...|$|R

500|$|The {{symbol of}} the slave ship is furthered by {{specific}} set designs, including the round window in Ben Geisler's office which resembles a <b>porthole,</b> {{as well as the}} walkway leading to Mayhew's bungalow, which resembles the boarding ramp of a watercraft. Several lines of dialogue make clear by the film's end that Barton has become a slave to the studio: [...] "he contents of your head", Lipnick's assistant tells him, [...] "are the property of Capitol Pictures". After Barton turns in his script, Lipnick delivers an even more brutal punishment: [...] "Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write". This contempt and control is representative of the opinions expressed by many writers in Hollywood at the time. As Arthur Miller said in his review of Barton Fink: [...] "The only thing about Hollywood that I am sure of is that its mastication of writers can never be too wildly exaggerated".|$|E
