40|$|Published {{test reports}} on the sound {{insulation}} of gypsum <b>plaster</b> <b>board</b> cavity stud walls with viscoelastic glue sandwiched between two layers of gypsum <b>plaster</b> <b>board</b> working as a constrained layer damper show large increases in sound insulation compared to the sound insulation of the same wall without the viscoelastic material. An increase in the sound insulation would be expected above the critical frequency of the gypsum <b>plaster</b> <b>board</b> panels and {{in the vicinity of}} the mass-air-mass resonant frequency due to the increased damping. However the test results show significant increases at other frequencies as well. A critical examination of the theory shows that the sound transmission via the air in the wall cavity is not expected to be greatly affected by the damping at these other frequencies. On the other hand, the sound transmission via the studs is affected at all frequencies by the damping. Hence it is not surprising that the published results are all for cavity stud walls. The sound insulation of two 16 mm thick gypsum <b>plaster</b> <b>board</b> sheets was measured. The sheets were mounted touching each other in three different configurations. These were without glue in between, bonded together with viscoelastic glue and spot bonded together with standard commercial glue. Surprisingly the elastic material compound gave better results even below the critical frequency, although the improvement became smaller and then disappeared as the frequency was decreased. A cavity stud wall with the second and third of the above configurations on each side of the studs was also tested. Again the viscoelastic glue performed better than the standard commercial glue, but the viscoelastic results were less than the original published results. Further published results were found which were in between the original published results and the experimental results obtained by the authors of this paper...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Four {{different}} {{commercially available}} gypsum <b>plaster</b> <b>boards</b> are investigated experimentally at fire temperatures {{with respect to}} their thermo-physical properties i. e., thermal conductivity, effective heat capacity and density. It is shown that depending on different ingredients (carbonates) different endothermic reactions occur between room temperature and 9008 C. These reactions strongly influence the temperature dependence of the mentioned properties which in turn affect the response of the material to fire. Based on these experimental results the thermal reaction of a gypsum-protected steel column in fire is modeled for the four types of gypsum. The results of numerical simulations demonstrate clearly the advantages caused by certain ingredients of the chemical composition of gypsum <b>plaster</b> <b>boards.</b> KEY WORDS: gypsum board, thermal analysis, dehydration, calcination, effective heat capacity, ISO standard fire, steel columns, dolomite, calcite...|$|R

50|$|Gypsum board evolved between 1910 and 1930 {{beginning}} with wrapped board edges and {{elimination of the}} two inner layers of felt paper in favor of paper-based facings. In 1910 United States Gypsum Corporation bought Sackett <b>Plaster</b> <b>Board</b> Company and by 1917 {{came out with a}} product they called Sheetrock. Providing efficiency of installation, it was developed additionally as a measure of fire resistance. Later air entrainment technology made boards lighter and less brittle, then joint treatment materials and systems also evolved. Rock lath (gypsum lath) was an early substrate for plaster. An alternative to traditional wood or metal lath, it was a panel made up of compressed gypsum <b>plaster</b> <b>board</b> that was sometimes grooved or punched with holes to allow wet plaster to key into its surface. As it evolved, it was faced with paper impregnated with gypsum crystals that bonded with the applied facing layer of plaster.|$|R
