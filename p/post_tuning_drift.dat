40|$|It {{has been}} known that the tunes of the Tevatron drift on the 150 GeV front porch. The drift is {{observed}} {{to have the same}} time dependence as the drift in the chromaticity. The variation in the chromaticity is due to the change in the b{sub 2 } of the superconducting dipoles, which represents the integrated sextupole moment of the magnet. It is reasonable to assume that the <b>tune</b> <b>drift</b> is due to the feed down from the changing b{sub 2 }. Calculations based on this assumption, both here and in earlier attempts to explain the <b>tune</b> <b>drift,</b> show, absent unreasonable assumptions about the closed orbit, that the simple models of the variation of the sextupole moment will not explain the <b>tune</b> <b>drift.</b> An explanation, for both the <b>tune</b> <b>drift</b> and the <b>tune</b> split observed when the Tevatron was first operated, is proposed which is based on the longitudinal variation of the sextupole component in the dipoles {{and the fact that the}} dipoles are not perfect sector magnets...|$|R
40|$|The {{setup for}} tune {{measurement}} of Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (SRRC) booster and its performance {{are described in}} this report. <b>Tune</b> <b>drift</b> during ramping was observed in routine operation. The fractional <b>tune</b> <b>drift</b> can be as large as 0. 2. In some of the cases, beam capture at injection and its acceleration was severely degraded. In order to improve this situation, a measurement system {{was set up to}} monitor tune shift during ramping. Tune information was obtained by using FFT conversion of turn by turn beam position signals. Besides, tracking errors among focusing/defocusing quadrupoles and dipole were monitored with precision magnetic current meters. Their ratio varied during ramping was correlated to the tune shift mentioned above. With the help of these two monitoring tools, the working tunes were optimized to get more efficient operation. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tune</b> and {{coupling}} <b>drift</b> {{were observed}} by Annala and Martens in the Tevatron {{during the initial}} stages of run II. Using standard formulae the observed <b>tune</b> <b>drift</b> over two hours on the injection porch can be correlated with a total of ~ 100 units (of 10 - 4 times the dipole field at injection) of quadrupolar field over the entire ring. This indicates a small effect, which can be produced by one (normal-b 1 - or skew-a 1 -) corrector quad running at ~ 7 A. The time-dependence of the <b>tune</b> and coupling <b>drift</b> is logarithmic, {{similar to that of the}} sextupole (b 2) drift in the main dipoles. It is therefore suspected that the cause of the problem lies within the main superconducting magnets of the Tevatron. The following note discusses the <b>tune</b> <b>drift</b> issue in the Tevatron, and explores possible avenues of explanation. These are a) feed-down effects from the sextupole fields in the main dipoles and sextupole correctors due to beam-offset and/or systematic magnet mis-alignment and geometric errors; b) possible wiring errors in the corrector circuits, c) possible decaying main fields in quadrupoles and d) decaying skew and normal quadrupole components in the main dipoles.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an air-filled substrate integrated waveguide (AFSIW) filter post-process tuning technique. The emerging high-performance AFSIW technology is of high {{interest for the}} design of microwave and millimeter-wave substrate integrated systems based on low-cost multilayer printed circuit board (PCB) process. However, to comply with stringent specifica-tions, especially for space, aeronautical and safety applications, a filter post-process tuning technique is desired. AFSIW single pole filter post-process tuning using a capacitive post is theoret-ically analyzed. It is demonstrated that a tuning of more than 3 % of the resonant frequency is achieved at 21 GHz using a 0. 3 mm radius post with a 40 % insertion ratio. For experi-mental demonstration, a fourth-order AFSIW band pass filter operating in the 20. 88 to 21. 11 GHz band is designed and fabri-cated. Due to fabrication tolerances, it is shown that its perfor-mances are not in line with expected results.

40|$|AbstractThe {{horizontal}} and vertical betatron tunes of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) mainly depend {{on the strength of}} the quadrupole magnets, but are also affected by the quadrupole component in the main dipoles. In case of systematic misalignments, the sextupole component from the main dipoles and sextupole corrector magnets also affect the tunes due to the feed down effect. During the first years of operation of the LHC, the tunes have been routinely measured and corrected through either a feedback or a feed forward system. In this paper, the evolution of the tunes during injection, ramp and flat top are reconstructed from the beam measurements and the settings of the tune feedback loop and of the feed forward corrections. This gives the obtained precision of the magnetic model of the machine with respect to quadrupole and sextupole components. Measurements at the injection plateau show an unexpected large decay whose origin is not understood. This data is discussed together with the time constants and the dependence on previous cycles. We present results of dedicated experiments that show that this effect does not originate from the decay of the main dipole component. During the ramp, the <b>tunes</b> <b>drift</b> by about 0. 022. It is shown that this is related to the precision of tracking the quadrupole field in the machine and this effect is reduced to about 0. 01 tune units during flat top...|$|R

40|$|A tuning {{method for}} FLake, a {{one-dimensional}} (1 -D) freshwater lake model, is {{applied for the}} individual tuning of 244 globally distributed large lakes using observed lake surface water temperatures (LSWTs) derived from along-track scanning radiometers (ATSRs). The model, which was tuned using only three lake properties (lake depth, snow and ice albedo and light extinction coefficient), substantially improves the measured mean differences in various features of the LSWT annual cycle, including the LSWTs of saline and high altitude lakes, {{when compared to the}} observed LSWTs. Lakes whose lake-mean LSWT persists below 1  °C for part of the annual cycle are considered to be seasonally ice-covered. For trial seasonally ice-covered lakes (21 lakes), the daily mean and standard deviation (2 σ) of absolute differences between the modelled and observed LSWTs are reduced from 3. 07  °C ±  2. 25  °C to 0. 84  °C ±  0. 51  °C by tuning the model. For all other trial lakes (14 non-ice-covered lakes), the improvement is from 3. 55  °C ±  3. 20  °C to 0. 96  °C ±  0. 63  °C. The <b>post</b> <b>tuning</b> results for the 35 trial lakes (21 seasonally ice-covered lakes and 14 non-ice-covered lakes) are highly representative of the post-tuning results of the 244 lakes. For the 21 seasonally ice-covered lakes, the modelled response of the summer LSWTs to changes in snow and ice albedo is found to be statistically related to lake depth and latitude, which together explain 0. 50 (R 2 adj, p [*]=[*] 0. 001) of the inter-lake variance in summer LSWTs. Lake depth alone explains 0. 35 (p [*]=[*] 0. 003) of the variance. Lake characteristic information (snow and ice albedo and light extinction coefficient) is not available for many lakes. The approach taken to tune the model, bypasses the need to acquire detailed lake characteristic values. Furthermore, the tuned values for lake depth, snow and ice albedo and light extinction coefficient for the 244 lakes provide some guidance on improving FLake LSWT modelling...|$|R

Traditional module selection techniques in high level synthesis use worst case delay/power information to perform the optimization, and therefore may be too pessimistic such that extra resources are used to guarantee design requirements. Parametric yield, which {{is defined as the}} probability of the synthesized hardware meeting the performance/power constraints, can be used to guide design space exploration. The para-metric yield can be effectively improved by combining both design-time variation-aware optimization and <b>post</b> silicon <b>tuning</b> techniques (such as adaptive body biasing (ABB)). In this paper, we propose a module selection algorithm that combines design-time optimization with post-silicon tuning (using ABB) to maximize design yield. A variation-aware module selection algorithm based on efficient performance and power yield gradient computation is developed. The post silicon optimization is formulated as an efficient sequential conic program to determine the optimal body bias distribution, which in turn affects design-time module selection. The experiment results show that significant yield can be achieved compared to traditional worst-case driven module selection technique. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first variability-driven high level synthesis technique that considers post-silicon tuning during design time optimization. 1 I...|$|R
