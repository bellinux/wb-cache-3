40|$|There {{is a large}} {{potential}} to use <b>passive</b> <b>technologies</b> for increasing the thermal comfort and reducing the energy use for heating and cooling in buildings. In many cases the occupants of the building lack good practical understanding and knowledge on how these <b>passive</b> <b>technologies</b> function. Therefore, there {{is a challenge to}} utilize their full potential. For instance, the potential energy savings for space heating and cooling is 5 - 21 % with phase change materials (PCMs) integrated in building envelopes (e. g. encapsulated in the plaster board). Consequently, there is a pedagogical problem to explain how and when PCMs are active in regard to passive adjustment to changes in the indoor environment. The reason for this is the lack of proper tools. Temperature sensors alone or numbers on the energy use is not enough to give the occupants information on how to use the <b>passive</b> <b>technologies</b> in the most efficient way. One aim of this study is therefore to explore properties that {{can be used as a}} foundation for the development of technologies for visualizing the phase transition. Laboratory experiments are used to evaluate three methodologies based on density, viscosity and optical properties that change when a PCM undergoes a phase transition. The results are compared to phase transition measurements by DSC. The methods are tested on a type of organic PCMs, polyethylene glycol (PEG), of different molecular weights. From the results it is obvious that all three methods can be used to differentiate the phases even if there remains challenges before practical implementation in buildings is possible...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} an extended {{exploration of the}} performance of low-energy earth–air heat exchanger (EAHE) cooling in hot and humid Malaysia from the published work of Sanusi (2013). The increasing demand of air-conditioning for cooling purposes motivates this investigation in search for better cooling alternatives. The <b>passive</b> <b>technology,</b> where soil underground was used as a heat sink to produce cooler air, has yet to be investigated further in hot and humid countries. This work, the <b>passive</b> <b>technology,</b> is tested by carrying out two interconnected field investigations: soil temperature measurement and the earth pipe cooling experiment for 1 year. In 1 year, soil temperature distribution at 1 m depth fluctuates, influenced by the different seasons in a year. However, the soil at 1 m depth is cooler than deeper soil during the wet season. Therefore, for investigating the EAHE cooling performance for 1 year, the pipe was buried at 1 m depth at the same test site. A significant temperature drop was found in the 1 -m-depth-buried pipe: up to 6. 3 and 8. 6 [*]°C, respective to the seasons of the year. Thermal comfort of air temperature at the buried pipe outlet was analyzed with Khedari thermal comfort chart, and the result has shown that the buried pipe outlet air temperatures are within the range of thermal comfort conditions for hot/humid countries. This study has showed a potential of earth pipe cooling technology in providing low-energy cooling in buildings in Malaysia...|$|E
