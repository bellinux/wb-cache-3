5|$|As {{intriguing}} as geometric Newtonian gravity may be, its basis, classical mechanics, {{is merely}} a limiting case of (special) relativistic mechanics. In the language of symmetry: where gravity can be neglected, <b>physics</b> <b>is</b> Lorentz invariant as in special relativity rather than Galilei invariant as in classical mechanics. (The defining symmetry of special relativity is the Poincaré group, which includes translations, rotations and boosts.) The {{differences between the two}} become significant when dealing with speeds approaching the speed of light, and with high-energy phenomena.|$|E

5|$|Condensed matter <b>physics</b> <b>is</b> {{a branch}} of physics that deals with the {{physical}} properties of condensed phases of matter, where particles adhere to each other. Condensed matter physicists seek to understand the behavior of these phases by using physical laws. In particular, they include the laws of quantum mechanics, electromagnetism and statistical mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Many of the representations, both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional, are {{important}} in theoretical physics. Representations appear {{in the description of}} fields in classical field theory, most importantly the electromagnetic field, and of particles in relativistic quantum mechanics, as well as of both particles and quantum fields in quantum field theory and of various objects in string theory and beyond. The representation theory also provides the theoretical ground for the concept of spin. The theory enters into general relativity in the sense that in small enough regions of spacetime, <b>physics</b> <b>is</b> that of special relativity.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy of <b>physics</b> <b>is</b> {{the study}} of the fundamental, {{philosophical}} questions underlying modern physics, {{the study of}} matter and energy and how they interact. The main questions concern the nature of space and time, atoms and atomism. Also included are the predictions of cosmology, the interpretation of quantum mechanics, the foundations of statistical mechanics, causality, determinism, and the nature of physical laws. Classically, several of these questions were studied as part of metaphysics (for example, those about causality, determinism, and space and time).|$|E

5|$|A few {{theoretical}} physicists {{have argued}} that classical <b>physics</b> <b>is</b> intrinsically incapable of explaining the holistic aspects of consciousness, but that quantum theory may provide the missing ingredients. Several theorists have therefore proposed quantum mind (QM) theories of consciousness. Notable theories falling into this category include the holonomic brain theory of Karl Pribram and David Bohm, and the Orch-OR theory formulated by Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose. Some of these QM theories offer descriptions of phenomenal consciousness, as well as QM interpretations of access consciousness. None of the quantum mechanical theories has been confirmed by experiment. Recent publications by G. Guerreshi, J. Cia, S. Popescu, and H. Briegel could falsify proposals {{such as those of}} Hameroff, which rely on quantum entanglement in protein. At the present time many scientists and philosophers consider the arguments for an important role of quantum phenomena to be unconvincing.|$|E
5|$|A general {{application}} of matrices in <b>physics</b> <b>is</b> to {{the description of}} linearly coupled harmonic systems. The equations of motion of such systems {{can be described in}} matrix form, with a mass matrix multiplying a generalized velocity to give the kinetic term, and a force matrix multiplying a displacement vector to characterize the interactions. The best way to obtain solutions is to determine the system's eigenvectors, its normal modes, by diagonalizing the matrix equation. Techniques like this are crucial {{when it comes to the}} internal dynamics of molecules: the internal vibrations of systems consisting of mutually bound component atoms. They are also needed for describing mechanical vibrations, and oscillations in electrical circuits.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the deepest}} {{problems}} in modern <b>physics</b> <b>is</b> the problem of quantum gravity. The current understanding of gravity is based on Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which is formulated {{within the framework of}} classical physics. However, nongravitational forces are described within the framework of quantum mechanics, a radically different formalism for describing physical phenomena based on probability. A quantum theory of gravity is needed in order to reconcile general relativity with the principles of quantum mechanics, but difficulties arise when one attempts to apply the usual prescriptions of quantum theory to the force of gravity.|$|E

5000|$|The laws of <b>physics</b> <b>are</b> {{invariant}} {{with respect}} to orientation—for example, floating in outer space, there is no measurement {{you can do to}} say [...] "which way is up"; the laws of <b>physics</b> <b>are</b> the same regardless of how you are oriented.

5|$|Theoretical {{understanding}} of condensed matter <b>physics</b> <b>is</b> {{closely related to}} the notion of emergence, wherein complex assemblies of particles behave in ways dramatically different from their individual constituents. For example, a range of phenomena related to high temperature superconductivity are understood poorly, although the microscopic physics of individual electrons and lattices is well known. Similarly, models of condensed matter systems have been studied where collective excitations behave like photons and electrons, thereby describing electromagnetism as an emergent phenomenon. Emergent properties can also occur at the interface between materials: one example is the lanthanum aluminate-strontium titanate interface, where two non-magnetic insulators are joined to create conductivity, superconductivity, and ferromagnetism.|$|E
5|$|The Standard Model of {{particle}} <b>physics</b> <b>is</b> a theory which describes {{three of the}} four known fundamental interactions between the elementary particles that make up all matter. This theory allows predictions to be made about how particles will interact under many conditions. The energy per particle in a supernova is typically one to one hundred and fifty picojoules (tens to hundreds of MeV). The per-particle energy involved in a supernova is small enough that the predictions gained from the Standard Model {{of particle}} physics are likely to be basically correct. But the high densities may require corrections to the Standard Model. In particular, Earth-based particle accelerators can produce particle interactions which are of much higher energy than are found in supernovae, but these experiments involve individual particles interacting with individual particles, and {{it is likely that the}} high densities within the supernova will produce novel effects. The interactions between neutrinos and the other particles in the supernova take place with the weak nuclear force, which is believed to be well understood. However, the interactions between the protons and neutrons involve the strong nuclear force, which is much less well understood.|$|E
