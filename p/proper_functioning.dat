5|$|Chromium, arsenic, cadmium, mercury, {{and lead}} have the {{greatest}} potential to cause harm on account of their extensive use, the toxicity {{of some of their}} combined or elemental forms, and their widespread distribution in the environment. Hexavalent chromium, for example, is highly toxic as are mercury vapour and many mercury compounds. These five elements have a strong affinity for sulfur; in the human body they usually bind, via thiol groups (–SH), to enzymes responsible for controlling the speed of metabolic reactions. The resulting sulfur-metal bonds inhibit the <b>proper</b> <b>functioning</b> of the enzymes involved; human health deteriorates, sometimes fatally. Chromium (in its hexavalent form) and arsenic are carcinogens; cadmium causes a degenerative bone disease; and mercury and lead damage the central nervous system.|$|E
5|$|Examination of fruiting bodies using {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} and transmission electron microscopy has revealed details about their ultrastructure—their microscopic architecture and arrangement. For example, the hyphae of the hapteron form a dense tangled network, while the hyphae of the funicular cord are arranged in a twisted form like a rope. Further, the funicular cord, known to be highly elastic and with a high tensile strength, is made of thicker hyphae {{than the rest of}} the funiculus. Also, the ecto- and endoperidium are made of thick-walled, unbranched hyphae, known as skeletal hyphae. It has been proposed that these skeletal hyphae form a structural network that helps the fruiting body maintain the elasticity vital for <b>proper</b> <b>functioning</b> of the spore dispersal mechanism.|$|E
5|$|The World was {{developed}} by a German programmer named Harald Hoerwick; its backstory {{is based on the}} Epitaph of Twilight, an epic poem by Emma Wielant. Her death inspired Hoerwick to create the game. Elements of the poem are coded into the game's programming. The hidden purpose of Hoerwick's game is to develop the ultimate artificial intelligence (AI), which is capable of making decisions for itself. To this end, Hoerwick inserted functions into the system which monitor and extract behavioral data from millions of the game's players to aid in the AI's learning process. After Hoerwick's death, these pieces of code became black boxes to the current developers, who cannot fathom their purpose, yet are critical to the <b>proper</b> <b>functioning</b> of the game.|$|E

Certificate of Building <b>Proper</b> <b>Function</b> (SLF) building is a certificate that is given for buildings that have been completely built and have the eligibility requirements of the function of the building as a condition to be used, its given by the local government to declare the airworthiness of the function of a building both technically and administratively before utilization. In Semarang City Regional Regulation Number 5 / 2009 about Buildings has also been mandated for the realization of buildings in the city of Semarang reliable, in order to take effect immediately Certificate of Building <b>Proper</b> <b>Function</b> (SLF) on buildings in the city of Semarang. According to the Regulation of the Minister of Public Works Number 45 / PRT / M / 2007 about Technical Guidelines Development of State Building, every state building must be equipped with a permitting document such as IMB (Building Permit), Certificate of Building <b>Proper</b> <b>Function</b> (SLF) or the airworthiness of similar function for areas that do not make adjustments, where these documents are very important as a guarantee of airworthiness functions of a building. As the part who issued the Certificate of Building <b>Proper</b> <b>Function</b> (SLF), Semarang city government in this case was handled by the Department of Urban Planning and Residential is currently only issuing Letter of Building <b>Proper</b> <b>Function</b> (SLF), and should provide concrete examples of how the process of issuing and enforcing the function of Certificate of Building <b>Proper</b> <b>Function</b> (SLF) in Semarang city.

In addition to knowing the impact that faced toward enforcement.

This indicates that Semarang city administration has not fully prepared for the implementation of Regulation of the Minister of Public Works Number 25 / PRT/M/ 2007 about Certificate of Building <b>Proper</b> <b>Function</b> (SLF).

5|$|The {{receptor}} for AtPep1 {{has been}} identified as a 170KDa LRR-RLK and has been named AtPEPR1. AtPep1 is active at 0.1 nano-molar (nM) concentrations and the receptor saturates at 1nM. An analysis {{of the structure of the}} AtPEPR1 receptor has shown that it is a member of the LRR XI subfamily of LRR-RLKs in A. thaliana which includes the receptor for another peptide hormone CLAVATA3. Transforming tobacco cell cultures with AtPEPR1 allowed them to respond to AtPep1 in an alkalisation assay, whereas normal tobacco did not show such a response. BRI1-associated receptor kinase 1 (BAK1) is an LRR-RLK found in A. thaliana, which has been proposed to function as an adaptor protein that is required for the <b>proper</b> <b>functioning</b> of other RLKs.

40|$|Are {{learning}} processes selection processes? This paper takes {{a slightly}} {{modified version of}} the account of selection presented in Hull et al. (Behav Brain Sci 24 : 511 – 527, 2001) and asks whether it applies to learning processes. The answer is that although some learning processes are selectional, many are not. This has consequences for teleological theories of mental content. According to these theories, mental states have content in virtue of having <b>proper</b> <b>functions,</b> and they have <b>proper</b> <b>functions</b> in virtue of being the products of selection processes. For some mental states, it is plausible that the relevant selection process is natural selection, but there are many for which it is not plausible. One response to this (due to David Papineau) is to suggest that the learning processes by which we acquire non-innate mental states are selection processes and can therefore confer <b>proper</b> <b>functions</b> on mental states. This paper considers two ways in which this response could be elaborated, and argues that neither of them succeed: the teleosemanticist cannot rely on the claim that learning processes are selection processes in order to justify the attribution of <b>proper</b> <b>functions</b> to beliefs...|$|R
