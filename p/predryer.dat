Lumber in this category {{is said to be}} “casehardened. ” Drying stresses are a normal result of the drying process. Stresses can develop in the air-drying yard, in the <b>predryer</b> during dehumidification drying, or particularly during steam kiln drying. Drying stresses may be either transverse or longitudinal, the transverse type generally creates the most problems. The severity of the drying stresses varies with the drying method and the drying conditions. As the lumber is machined, especially during the ripping operation, the stresses are relieved, and unacceptable distortion often results (Figure 1). Thus, these stresses should be relieved during the drying operation for lumber, which is then cut u...|$|E
