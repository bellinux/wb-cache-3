40|$|Treatment of <b>paracetamol</b> <b>intoxication</b> {{consists}} of administration of N-acetylcysteine, preferably shortly after paracetamol ingestion. In most countries, {{the decision to}} treat patients with N-acetylcysteine depends on the paracetamol plasma concentration. In the literature, different arguments are given regarding when to treat paracetamol overdose. Some authors do not recommend treatment with N-acetylcysteine at low paracetamol plasma concentrations since unnecessary adverse effects may be induced. But no treatment with N-acetylcysteine at higher paracetamol plasma concentrations may lead to unnecessary severe morbidity and mortality. In this review, we provide an overview on the severity and prevalence of adverse side effects after N-acetylcysteine administration and the consequences these side effects may have {{for the treatment of}} <b>paracetamol</b> <b>intoxication.</b> The final conclusion is to continue using the guidelines of the Dutch National Poisons Information Centre for N-acetylcysteine administration in <b>paracetamol</b> <b>intoxication.</b> © Van Zuiden Communications B.

The present work in mice was undertaken to study the effect of caffeine on mortality rates and biochemical and histological parameters of liver damage after administration of toxic doses of paracetamol. It was found that caffeine markedly increased the survival rate after administration ofa dose ofparacetamol that was lethal to 50 % and 100 % ofmice, reduced liver damage as assessed by serum glutamic pyruvic and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase activities, partially prevented the depletion of reduced glutathione and reduced histological changes to the liver accompanying <b>paracetamol</b> <b>intoxication.</b> The results support the possibility that caffeine might be useful {{for the treatment of}} <b>paracetamol</b> <b>intoxication</b> in humans...|$|E
40|$|Paracetamol {{poisoning}} occurs {{frequently in}} the Netherlands. In order to study {{the way in which}} paracetamol poisonings are being treated in Dutch hospitals, a survey was sent to all Dutch hospital pharmacies, in which they were asked to sent their current protocol for the treatment of paracetamol poisoning. A total of 48 hospital pharmacies returned the survey, which corresponds to a response of 58 %. This survey shows that on average each hospital pharmacy is confronted with 32 paracetamol poisonings a year (a total of 2500 poisonings a year in the Netherlands), of which about 16 % are sufficiently serious to initiate treatment with acetylcysteine according to the treatment nomograms used. The protocols that were sent back, were judged on a number of criteria, that, in our opinion, were obligatory in a protocol. Thus, this study illustrates the current standard of Dutch protocols for the treatment of paracetamol poisoning. Improvements in many protocols in the fields of general information on <b>paracetamol</b> <b>intoxications,</b> the anamnesis, diagnostics and treatment are necessary.

40|$|Objective: In this study, we {{aimed to}} present our {{clinical}} experiences of intravenous (IV) N-Acetyl cystein administration in patients admitted to our emergency department with <b>paracetamol</b> <b>intoxication.</b> Material and Methods: This {{study was conducted}} between January 2007 and December 2009, in the Ondokuz Mayis University Medical Faculty Hospital, Emergency Service, and the hospital records of adult patients admitted with paracetamol poisoning were examined retrospectively. Fifty three patients {{who were exposed to}} toxic dose and administered IV NAC therapy were included in the study. In acute intoxication 140 mg/kg and 7. 5 gr and above in 24 hours were considered as toxic dose. Obtained data using SPSS 15. 0 (Statistical Package for Social Science) program was recorded and analyzed. Data are given as mean±standard deviation. Results: Of the patients, 27 were female (50. 9 %) average age 25. 0 ± 7. 1 years, and 26 were male (49. 1 %) average age 29. 5 ± 10. 4 years. There was no difference in {{the average age of the}} sexes (p> 0. 05). Nausea and/or vomitting was determined in 56. 6 % of the patients. Average dose ingested was 11. 9 ± 4. 5.

40|$|In {{experimental}} studies, the old mucolytic agent N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has had {{beneficial effects}} in disorders supposedly linked to oxidative stress. Numerous, mainly small clinical trials with variable doses have yielded inconsistent {{results in a}} wide variety of diseases.

In a large intervention trial on cancer recurrence, NAC was ineffective. NAC infusions have been widely used in acute hepatic failure but convincing evidence of its benefits is lacking. A preliminary study reported that NAC is effective in preventing radiocontrast-induced nephropathy but thereafter highly mixed results have been published, and even meta-analyses disagree on its efficacy.

40|$|Paracetamol {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used analgesics and antipyretics available without limits as preparations of the OTC group (over the counter drugs). Overdose and poisoning with this drug always brings about the risk of acute hepatic failure. The objective of the study was a retrospective evaluation of patients hospitalized in the Paediatric Clinic during the period 2004 – 2012 due to poisoning with paracetamol. The analysis covered 44 patients hospitalized in the Paediatric Clinic during 2004 – 2012 due to poisoning with paracetamol. Patients were divided into three groups: intentional poisonings, accidental poisonings, and drug overdose. During the period of the study, 44 patients aged 2. 1 – 17. 1, poisoned with paracetamol, were hospitalized.

40|$|APOLT {{has been}} {{developed}} both to enable the native liver to regenerate in acute liver failure and to avoid the risks of long-term immunosuppressive therapy. We present our experience with APOLT in 4 patients with acute liver failure. The patients were 33, 18, 5, and 34 years of age, respectively. The causes of hepatic failure were: one HELLP syndrome, one <b>paracetamol</b> <b>intoxication,</b> and 2 causes which remained undetermined. All patients were in coma before transplantation. First symptoms had occurred 13, 2, 30, and 20 days prior to APOLT, respectively. In all cases, segments II and III of the recipient's own liver were resected before implanting the auxiliary liver orthotopically. The auxiliary graft consisted of segments II and III in 2 cases and of II, III, and IV in the other 2 patients. The auxiliary graft showed good initial function in all cases. All 4 patients are alive 5 years, 15 months, 6 months, and one month after transplantation. In the last patient, an arterial thrombosis of the graft on the 5 th postoperative day required retransplantation. The immunosuppressive therapy could be stopped in 3 cases and the graft was removed in 2 patients 15 and 40 days after APOLT, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: N-acetylcysteine (NAC) {{has been}} in {{clinical}} practice for several decades. It {{has been used as}} a mucolytic agent and for the treatment of numerous disorders including <b>paracetamol</b> <b>intoxication,</b> doxorubicin cardiotoxicity, ischemia-reperfusion cardiac injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, bronchitis, chemotherapy-induced toxicity, HIV/AIDS, heavy metal toxicity and psychiatric disorders. SCOPE OF REVIEW: The mechanisms underlying the therapeutic and clinical applications of NAC are complex and still unclear. The present review is focused on the chemistry of NAC and its interactions and functions at the organ, tissue and cellular levels in an attempt to bridge the gap between its recognized biological activities and chemistry. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: The antioxidative activity of NAC as of other thiols can be attributed to its fast reactions with OH, NO 2, CO 3 (-) and thiyl radicals as well as to restitution of impaired targets in vital cellular components. NAC reacts relatively slowly with superoxide, hydrogen-peroxide and peroxynitrite, which cast some doubt on the importance of these reactions under physiological conditions. The uniqueness of NAC is most probably due to efficient reduction of disulfide bonds in proteins thus altering their structures and disrupting their ligand bonding, competition with larger reducing molecules in sterically less accessible spaces, and serving as a precursor of cysteine for GSH synthesis. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The outlined reactions only partially explain the diverse biological effects of NAC, and further studies are required for determining its ability to cross the cell membrane and the blood-brain barrier as well as elucidating its reactions with components of cell signaling pathways.

40|$|Objective: To {{demonstrate}} the in-vivo hepatoprotective {{effect of the}} ethanolic extracts of Citrullus colocynthis (Linn.) against paracetamol induced hepatotoxicity in albino rats. Animal Model: Swiss Albino rats of either sex were used, divided into six groups with six in each group. Group 1 -Normal control: The animals were maintained under normal control, which were given distilled water only. Group 2 -Induction of hepatotoxicity: The animals received paracetamol 500 mg/kg b. w. (p. o) every 72 h for 10 Days. Groups 3 to 5 : Animals received ethanolic extract of Citrullus colocynthis L. at 50, 100 & 200 mg/kg bw/day for 7 days (p. o). Group 6 : The animals were treated with Silymarin (100 mg/kg p. o) which served as standard. Groups 3 to 6 were intoxicated with paracetamol (500 mg/kg bw) 1 h before the administration of extract or Silymarin for 10 days. Histopathological findings, different hepatic biochemical parameters viz. AST, ALT, ALP, Total bilirubin, Total cholesterol, Triglycerides, & the body weight before & after treatment were evaluated to investigate the hepatoprotective activity. Results: Paracetamol induced a significant rise in AST, ALT, ALP, Total Bilirubin, Total Cholesterol, Triglycerides. Administration of 200 mg/kg bw of ethanolic extract of Citrullus colocynthis L. effectively reduced these pathological damages caused by <b>paracetamol</b> <b>intoxication.</b> In addition to serum parameters treatment of 200 mg/kg bw of ethanolic extract of Citrulus colocynthis L. also promotes the body weight in albino rats as shown in Figure 6 respectively.

40|$|AbstractReactive free oxygen {{radicals}} {{are known to}} play an important role in the pathogenesis of various lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or cystic fibrosis (CF). They can originate from endogenous processes or can be part of exogenous exposures (e. g. ozone, cigarette smoke, asbestos fibres). Consequently, therapeutic enhancement of anti-oxidant defence mechanisms in these lung disorders seems a rational approach. In this regard, N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and ambroxol have both been frequently investigated. Because of its SH group, NAC scavenges H 2 O 2 (hydrogen peroxide), ·OH (hydroxol radical), and HOCl (hypochlorous acid). Furthermore, NAC can easily be deacetylated to cysteine, an important precursor of cellular glutathione synthesis, and thus stimulate the cellular glutathione system. This is most evident in pulmonary diseases characterized by low glutathione levels and high oxidant production by inflammatory cells (e. g. in IPF and ARDS). NAC is an effective drug in the treatment of <b>paracetamol</b> <b>intoxication</b> and may even be protective against side-effects of mutagenic agents. In addition NAC reduces cellular production of pro-inflammatory mediators (e. g. TNF-α, IL- 1). Also, ambroxol [trans- 4 -(2 -amino- 3, 5 -dibromobenzylamino) -cyclohexane hydrochloride] scavenges oxidants (e. g. ·OH, HOCl). Moreover, ambroxol reduces bronchial hyperreactivity, and it is known to stimulate cellular surfactant production. In addition, ambroxol has anti-inflammatory properties owing to its inhibitory effect on the production of cellular cytokines and arachidonic acid metabolites. For both substances effective anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory function has been validated when used in micromolar concentrations. These levels are attainable in vivo in humans. This paper gives an up-to-date overview about the current knowledge of the hypothesis that oxidant-induced cellular damage underlies the pathogenesis of many human pulmonary diseases, and it discusses the feasibility of anti-oxidant augmentation therapy to the lung by using NAC or ambroxol...|$|E
