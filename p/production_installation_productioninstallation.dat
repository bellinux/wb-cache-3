40|$|Abstract — Managing large {{computing}} infrastructures in {{a reliable}} and efficient way requires system configuration tools which accept higher-level specifications. This paper describes an interface between the established configuration tool LCFG, and the experimental configuration tool PoDIM. The combined system is used to generate explicit real-world configurations from high-level, constraint-based specifications. The concept is validated using live data from a large <b>production</b> <b>installation.</b> This demonstrates that a loosely-coupled, multi-layer approach {{can be used to}} construct configuration tools which translate highlevel requirements into deployable production configurations...|$|R
