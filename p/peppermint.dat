5|$|The Germans had not developed, {{and did not}} employ {{radioactive}} poisons, so Operation <b>Peppermint</b> {{was never}} put into effect. After VE-Day, the equipment and all the documents relating to Operation <b>Peppermint</b> were collected, returned to the United States, and {{handed over to the}} Manhattan Project. However, the effort put into developing portable radiation detection equipment was not wasted. Survey teams from the Manhattan Project used the equipment to assess the fallout from the Trinity nuclear test, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Operation Crossroads, during which 10,000 film badges were used.|$|E
5|$|The {{song was}} used as a lip-sync song during the first season of RuPaul's Drag Race, when contestants BeBe Zahara Benet and Ongina had to lip-sync to avoid elimination, Benet winning the lip-sync and Ongina being eliminated. The song was used once again in the ninth season finale where two of the four finalists, Trinity Taylor and <b>Peppermint,</b> lip-synced to the song to qualify {{to move on to the}} final two, with <b>Peppermint</b> {{advancing}} and Taylor being eliminated.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to D-Day, {{full-scale}} rehearsals of Operation <b>Peppermint</b> were carried out in order to test the plan and the equipment. Ground and aerial surveys were also carried out to detect the presence of radioactive substances in troop concentration areas, and at sites in the United Kingdom that had been bombed, but none were detected.|$|E

5|$|Operation <b>Peppermint</b> was the codename given during World War II to {{preparations}} by the Manhattan Project and the European Theater of Operations United States Army (ETOUSA) {{to counter}} the danger that the Germans might disrupt the June 1944 Normandy landings with radioactive poisons.|$|E
5|$|They {{considered}} {{creating an}} Allied plan {{to counter the}} danger, but Whiteley {{said that he would}} have to consult with the British command before this could be approved. Colonel G. S. Eyster from G-3 was then ordered to prepare an American plan, under the codename Operation <b>Peppermint.</b> Further briefings were given to Admiral Harold Stark, and Lieutenant Generals Carl Spaatz and John C. H. Lee, and Eisenhower also wrote to Lieutenant General Hastings Ismay, the Chief of Staff of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill to inform the British Chiefs of Staff, but no British or American commanders actually participating in Operation Overlord were informed. The British subsequently adopted a similar plan to Operation <b>Peppermint,</b> and SHAEF assumed responsibility for coordinating the British and American efforts. Scientific assistance was provided by the Cavendish Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Banksia ilicifolia is a {{component}} of the critically endangered Assemblage of Tumulus Springs (organic mound springs) of the Swan Coastal Plain community north of Perth, which is characterised by a permanently moist peaty soil. The dominant trees include M. preissiana, swamp banksia (B. littoralis) and flooded gum (Eucalyptus rudis), with understorey ferns such as bracken (Pteridium esculentum) and Cyclosorus interruptus, and shrubs swamp <b>peppermint</b> (Taxandria linearifolia) and Astartea fascicularis.|$|E

5|$|The green rosella is {{predominantly}} herbivorous, with {{the seeds of}} grasses and trees—especially eucalypts—forming the bulk of its diet; other items eaten include the seed of the soft tree fern (Dicksonia antarctica), cranberry heath (Astroloma humifusum), myrtle beech (Lophozonia cunninghamii), Australian blackwood (Acacia melanoxylon), silver wattle (Acacia dealbata) and buttercups (Ranunculus), berries, nuts and fruit, as well as flowers and new buds of southern sassafras (Atherosperma moschatum), mānuka (Leptospermum scoparium), shining tea-tree (Leptospermum nitidum), swamp honey-myrtle (Melaleuca squamea), Tasmanian bluegum (Eucalyptus globulus), Smithton <b>peppermint</b> (Eucalyptus nitida), messmate stringybark (Eucalyptus obliqua), snow gum (Eucalyptus pauciflora), manna gum (Eucalyptus viminalis), small-fruit hakea (Hakea microcarpa) and native plum (Cenarrhenes nitida). The green rosella has at times partaken of the berries of the common hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), as well as Coprosma and Cyathodes, and even leaf buds of the common osier (Salix viminalis). It may eat insect larvae and insects such as psyllids of the genus Schedotrioza, which they extract from leaf galls on the black <b>peppermint</b> (Eucalyptus amygdalina).|$|E
5|$|Throughout its range, Banksia serrata {{is found}} on well-drained sandy soils that {{are low in}} nutrients, and is often found on stabilised soil near the coast but just behind the main dune system. In the Sydney region it is found with other typical {{woodland}} species, including yellow bloodwood (Corymbia eximia), red bloodwood (C. gummifera), silvertop ash (Eucalyptus sieberi), blue-leaved stringybark (E. agglomerata) and Sydney <b>peppermint</b> (E. piperita).|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} {{infertile}} {{areas of the}} Swan Coastal Plain, Hamersley would have supported open forests of Eucalyptus marginata (Jarrah) with Corymbia calophylla (Marri) or Eucalyptus gomphocephala (Tuart), and an understorey of Banksia attenuata (Candlestick Banksia), B.menziesii (Firewood Banksia), B.grandis (Bull Banksia), Allocasuarina fraseriana (Western Sheoak) and Agonis flexuosa (Swan River <b>Peppermint).</b> The main shrub species would have been Jacksonia sternbergiana (Stinkwood), J.furcellata (Grey Stinkwood), Acacia cyclops (Coastal Wattle), Acacia saligna (Orange Wattle), Hibbertia species, Allocasuarina humilis (Dwarf Sheoak), Calothamnus quadrifidus (One-sided Bottlebrush) and Grevillea thelemanniana (Spider Net Grevillea). Biodiversity surveys in 2006 have also identified a relatively rare species, Jacksonia sericea (Waldjumi), in two eastern Hamersley reserves.|$|E

5|$|In response, ETOUSA {{initiated}} Operation <b>Peppermint.</b> Special {{equipment was}} prepared. Eleven survey meters and a Geiger counter were shipped to England in early 1944, along with 1,500 film packets, which {{were used to}} measure radiation exposure. Another 25 survey meters, 5 Geiger counters and 1,500 film packets were held in storage in the United States, but in readiness to be shipped by air with the highest priority. Chemical Warfare Service teams were trained in its use, and Signal Corps personnel in its maintenance. The equipment was held in readiness, but the preparations were not needed, because the Germans had not developed such weapons.|$|E
5|$|In the Gibraltar Range National Park, it is a {{dominant}} shrub of open heathland and a non-dominant shrub of closed heath, mostly found in swampy heath associated with sedges. Plants here have {{some degree of}} self-compatibility. In the Sydney region, it grows in association with heath banksia (Banksia ericifolia), old man banksia (B.serrata), mountain devil (Lambertia formosa), lance-leaved geebung (Persoonia lanceolata) and dwarf apple (Angophora hispida) in heathland, and with silvertop ash (Eucalyptus sieberi), Blue Mountains ash (E.oreades), Sydney <b>peppermint</b> (E.piperita), scribbly gum (E.haemastoma), Blue Mountains mallee ash (E.stricta), brittle gum (E.mannifera), snow gum (E.pauciflora) and red bloodwood (Corymbia gummifera) in forested areas.|$|E
5|$|Omphalotus species cause a {{white rot}} by {{breaking}} down lignin in their tree hosts. The fungus infiltrates the heartwood {{of the tree}} via a breach in its bark, either by a branch falling, damage from insects or mistletoe, or by mechanical damage from logging. O.nidiformis has been implicated in the heartwood rot of several species of eucalypt around Australia, including marri (Corymbia calophylla) in southwest Western Australia, in spotted gum (C.maculata) and messmate (Eucalyptus obliqua) in New South Wales, and in blackbutt (E.pilularis), Sydney blue gum (E.saligna), red stringybark (E.macrorhyncha) and Forth River <b>peppermint</b> (E.radiata) in Victoria.|$|E

5|$|Some {{crop plants}} are hybrids from {{different}} genera (intergeneric hybrids), such as Triticale, × Triticosecale, a wheat–rye hybrid. Most modern and ancient wheat breeds are themselves hybrids; bread wheat, Triticum aestivum, is a hexaploid hybrid of three wild grasses. Several commercial fruits including loganberry (Rubus × loganobaccus) and grapefruit (Citrus × paradisi) are hybrids, as are garden herbs such as <b>peppermint</b> (Mentha × piperita), and trees {{such as the}} London plane (Platanus × acerifolia). Among many natural plant hybrids is Iris albicans, a sterile hybrid that spreads by rhizome division, and Oenothera lamarckiana, a flower that {{was the subject of}} important experiments by Hugo de Vries that produced an understanding of polyploidy.|$|E

Groves considered the risk that the Germans might attempt to disrupt the Normandy landings with radioactive poisons was sufficient to warn General Dwight D. Eisenhower and send an officer to brief his chief of staff, Lieutenant General Walter Bedell Smith.

5|$|While on {{the trail}} of the vampire known as The Moon, they then run into trouble when the shape-shifting vampire Hierophant tracks them and finds them. The group {{attempts}} to fight him, but he proves to be too powerful. When notified by <b>Peppermint</b> Butler (voiced by Steve Little) that the Hierophant cannot enter houses without permission, Jake shapeshifts into a house and the group takes shelter inside. The Hierophant then tells Marceline that he didn't come to fight, but to propose an alliance to take down the Vampire King together. Marceline agrees only on the condition that the Hierophant no longer drinks blood, but he attacks her instead. During the struggle, he is accidentally knocked into Jake and dies due to entering a house uninvited. Marceline reabsorbs his shapeshifting powers but then falls ill, having been stung and poisoned by the Hierophant's stinger. Princess Bubblegum takes Marceline to the Candy Kingdom {{to try to find a}} cure for the Hierophant's poison. Meanwhile, Finn and Jake track down the Moon in hopes of using her healing power to heal Marceline. Upon finding the Moon, they find that due to her healing powers, they can't kill her with their stakes. When the sun sets, the Moon wakes up and Finn and Jake flee, luring the Moon to the Candy Kingdom. However, when they try to fight back, the Moon uses her powers to incapacitate Finn and Jake as she attempts to kill Marceline. Fortunately, <b>Peppermint</b> Butler stabs the Moon in the back, her only weak spot. Marceline reabsorbs the Moon's healing power and fully recovers from the poison.|$|E
5|$|While {{spending}} time with Finn and Jake, Princess Bubblegum realizes {{that she needs to}} leave for a science convention in the Veggie Village. She entrusts the two with guarding her Princess Plant. However, when she departs, Finn and Jake party too hard with the plant, killing it. They then decide on a way to journey into the Land of the Dead and to reclaim the flower's soul from Death himself. For an unspecified price, <b>Peppermint</b> Butler (voiced by Steve Little) teaches the two how to get into the Underworld, and he instructs Finn and Jake also to tell Death that he said hello.|$|E
