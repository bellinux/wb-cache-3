40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the thermal behaviour <b>and</b> <b>isothermal</b> <b>crystallisation</b> kinetics study of cyclic polyesters and its blends, in particular cyclic poly (butylene terephthalate) (c-PBT). The production of c-PBT is interesting; {{in fact it}} is different from production of conventional linear PBT since c-PBT is produced by in situ polymerisation of cyclic butylene terephthalate oligomers (CBT) in the presence of suitable initiators or catalysts. These relatively novel materials, i. e. CBT offer many advantages in properties and the most unusual and useful is that they can be processed at low viscosity (water like) and exhibit rapid crystallisation. The thermal behaviour <b>and</b> <b>isothermal</b> <b>crystallisation</b> kinetics of CBT and c-PBT were analysed. The most significant achievement of this project is blending where blends of c-PBT and styrene maleimide (SMI) were prepared by simultaneous in situ polymerisation and melt blending of solid dispersion CBT/SMI powder. This is unique and novel and the results show consistency and signs of miscibility although there are no external forces applied during the melt blending. It was found that the presence of 30 wt % and above of SMI impeded the crystallisation of c-PBT. This suggests that miscibility occurred. The miscibility of these c-PBT/SMI blends was support with the presence of a single composition-dependent glass transition temperature and negative Flory-Huggins interaction parameter. Studies on crystallisation kinetics of c-PBT were also done by Avrami analysis and using the Hoffman-Lauritzen theory. Previously there have been very limited studies of the crystallisation kinetics of PBT produced from its oligomer. Further work on crystallisation of c-PBT/SMI blends was also performed.

The filler amount was varied {{in the range}} from 0 to 8 wt. %. The gas permeability decrease measured {{as a function of the}} clay content was accurately described by Nielsen law. The influence of O-MMT was studied on PIA non <b>isothermal</b> <b>and</b> <b>isothermal</b> <b>crystallisation.</b> The incorporation of small amounts of OMMTs within PLA favoured the polymer matrix crystallisation by decreasing the cold crystallisation temperature for heating thermal treatments and the <b>crystallisation</b> half-time for <b>isothermal</b> ones.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of ionising radiation with polymers is described and the literature relating; {{to the effects}} on polypropylene is reviewed. Oxidative and free radical reactions are discussed with particular reference to post-irradiationeffects. Isotactic and atactic polypropylene were δ and electron irradiated to doses of up to 20 megarad. Irradiations weremainly made in air. A series of other polymers were also irradiated in a preliminary survey. Molar mass measurements are {{used to measure the}} radiationyield for chain scission G (s). Irradiation at room temperature causes significantly more chain scission than at 195 K. Additional chain scission occurs on storage following irradiation at 195 K. Free radical concentrations are determined by electron spin resonance, and the decay rates measured. The radical formed in air is a peroxy radical and in vacuo is a hydrocarbon radical. At 77 K in vacuo the radical is -CH 2 - C* (CH 3) - CH 2 - but additional radicals are produced on warning to room temperature. The effects of increasing tenparature on radicals formed in air are described. Electron spin resonance studies on atactic polypropylene,and isotactic polypropylene in hydrogen, sulphur dioxide and nitric oxide are reported [...] The melting temperatures, spherulite growth rates, <b>and</b> <b>isothermal</b> <b>crystallisation</b> rates of irradiated polypropylene are compared to those of the non-irradiated polymer. Crystallisation is found to proceed with an Avrami integer n = 2. At a given crystallisation temperature, the overall crystallisation rate of irradiated polymer is less than the non-irradiated, but spherulite growth rates are identical. Thermogravimetric analysis is used to assess the thermal stability of irradiated polypropylene in nitrogen, air and oxygen. Hydroperoxide analysis is used to show that several molecules of oxygen are absorbed for each initial radical, and that hydroperoxides continue to be formed for a long period following irradiation.

Palm kernel oil contains short and medium triacylglycerols that can give desired melting characteristics and ensures the stable beta prime (P') polymorph in products. To enhance the PS compatibility, {{it needs to be}} blended and/or interesterified with soybean oil to impart desirable properties to the final products. Blends of PS, PKO and SBO at certain proportions were formulated using a mixture design (Design Expert 8. 0. 4, 2010). All the 10 oil blends were subjected to chemical and enzymatic interesterification. The physicochemical, thermal, polymorphism, microstructural, textural properties <b>and</b> kinetics of <b>isothermal</b> <b>crystallisation</b> were studied. The interesterified (IE) blends had lower slip melting points and solid fat contents due to the randomisation in the TAGs.

The hardness of interesterified blends were reduced following the reaction. Interesterification also altered the mechanism of crystallisation kinetics of the blends, depending on the composition and the crystallisation temperatures. The optimisation of interesterified ternary blends for trans-free table (TM) and soft margarine (SM) formulations were conducted through graphical multiple responses in Design-Expert.

40|$|The {{two main}} {{objectives}} of the current work were: 1) Isothermally crystallise samples of Carbon-Filled PEEK and Unfilled PEEK at a range of temperatures above the Tg and analyse them using the Conventional Avrami method and the Differential Avrami method. The results were then compared and conclusions drawn. 2) Characterise the crystallisation process {{by the use of}} two methods of determining polymer crystallinity. ATR-FTIR and Hyper-DSC were both used to determine sample crystallinity and correlations were drawn between the two methods to provide non-destructive crystallinity data of the samples. The <b>isothermal</b> <b>crystallisation</b> behaviour of the filled samples showed that at lower <b>isothermal</b> <b>crystallisation</b> temperatures, carbon inclusions hindered the nucleation process compared to that of neat PEEK. However, at higher crystallisation temperatures the carbon inclusions could be said to act as stress initiators that increase polymer nucleation and subsequent growth. It could also be seen that the use of the Differential Avrami approach to analyse the <b>Isothermal</b> <b>crystallisation</b> process gave a more accurate determination of the Avrami exponent n. It was found that the Differential approach gave a higher value of n, closer to the integer 4. This therefore shows a shift in crystallisation growth mechanism and is conclusive with other literature findings. 	FTIR and Hyper-DSC techniques can conclusively characterise crystalline presence within semi-crystalline PEEK. The crystalline fingerprint bands found within the FTIR spectra conclusively determined crystalline changes within pre-conditioned samples of PEEK, strongly correlating to other literature findings. Hyper-DSC results also showed that higher heating rates for determining crystallinity should be used in order to produce more accurate results and prevent any molecular melt and recrystallisation within the polymer samples. ...|$|R

Nine different stearin fractions with 1, 3 -distearoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycerol (StOSt) contents ranging from 69 – 84 % were obtained via fractionation from fats produced by acidolysis of high oleic sunflower oil (HOSO) with various mixtures of stearic (either 95 or 98 % pure) and palmitic acids (98 % pure). Samples were further treated with silica to reduce the oxidised glyceride <b>and</b> DAG content. <b>Isothermal</b> <b>crystallisation</b> at 20 °C showed a single main peak, but evidence of crystallisation during the initial DSC transient was also apparent for high StOSt content samples. This was confirmed as the α form by stop-and-return DSC and XRD. The main crystallisation event was generally faster (including a shorter induction time) for samples with higher StOSt levels (lower POSt levels). Silica treatment generally accelerated transformations to higher polymorphs (γ, β′ and β). Raman microscopy experiments showed that crystallisation of the β-form was achieved after 7 days storage at 20 °C but only in the silica treated stearin samples. This is consistent with higher solid fat content (SFC) values that were obtained with silica treated samples, which also increased with higher levels of StOSt. The results suggest that such stearins could potentially replace shea stearin in cocoa butter equivalents (CBE) formulations...|$|R

Several experimental techniques {{have been used to}} study the phase transitions in these block copolymers as well as the corresponding binary blends. These techniques have included the following: differential scanning calorimetry, optical microscopy, small angle light scattering, small angle and wide angle x-ray scattering. A major part of this work involved the design, construction and operation of the small angle light scattering technique. The <b>isothermal</b> <b>crystallisation</b> kinetics of both the block copolymers and blends with high percentages of ethylene oxide component were investigated. The phase behaviour of the block copolymers and the blends was also studied. This involved analysing melting point depression and glass d-ansition data as well as investigating the structural morphology of the polymer systems. The phase behaviour of the block copolymers and die blends containing intermediate component compositions was observed at temperatures below the melting point temperature of PEO. For two block copolymer systems containing 50 % and 55 % by weight ethylene oxide, the chemical joint within die block inhibited crystallisation directly from the melt. These block copolymers microphase separated at low temperatures forming microdomains rich in PEO. Upon heating, the PEO microdomains crystallised A phase diagram incorporating this behaviour as well as the phase behaviour of the blends is presented.

Poly aryl ether ether ketone (PEEK) is a semi-crystalline, high-performance engineering polymer whose properties can be enhanced through fibre reinforcement.

The results produced under conditions of <b>isothermal</b> <b>crystallisation</b> were analysed by means of a computer. Despite differences between batches of polymer all the additives with the exception of indigo produced a nucleating effect in the polymer as indicated by an increase in the rate of crystallisation compared with that of the base polymer. Two organo-metallic substances (sodium benzoate and sodium stearate) proved to be the most effective in this respect by decreasing the degree of supercooling of the polymer by 20 [degrees]. Morphological studies were carried out on isothermally crystallised samples, after etching and replication using a transmission electron microscope. A nodular structure whose dimensions were sensitive to both the nucleating agent and the temperature of crystallisation was observed. Mechanical testing of samples direct from the D. S. C. was carried out using a compression method. The breaking loads were found to vary with both the type of nucleating agent used and the crystallisation temperature chosen. A separate study involving the exanination of the resulting fracture surfaces by scanning electron microscopy revealed that a, high breaking load was associated with a fine discontinuous structure whereas lower breaking loads were characterised by a more continuous linear appearance. This implies a higher energy of fracture due to the increased surface area of the fracture surface of the former...|$|R

40|$|In this work, an {{in-depth}} analysis of crystalline characteristics has been performed for a {{unique set of}} strictly monodisperse poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL) oligomers. The molecules have different sets of end groups with various degrees of bulkiness and hydrogen bonding potential, affecting their aptitude to pack in ordered crystal structures. The oligomers also have different numbers of repeating units (n = 2 - 64), affecting the degree to which end groups influence overall molecular characteristics. The presence of bulky end groups leads to an innate confinement effect on crystallisation which in turn makes it possible to utilize the set of PCL oligomers to study confined space crystallisation. Confined space crystallisation is explored as a route to gain further understanding about the early metastable phases in crystal formation.   The monodisperse nature of the samples made it possible to collect very precise small-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering data (SAXS and WAXS) as well as calorimetric data. Computer modeling studies were performed to support experimental findings. It was shown that end groups strongly affected crystallisation features for the shorter oligomers (n ≤ 8) but to a lesser extend for the longer oligomers (n ≥ 16). The presence of a bulky end group at one end of an oligomer could inhibit the formation of hydrogen bonds on the other end. Short oligomers (n = 8) with OH-end groups exhibited novel packing characteristics. At one <b>isothermal</b> <b>crystallisation</b> temperature the molecules exhibited not only lamellar ordering but also an additional, likely rectangular or slanted, ordering. The sample was packed in a unique structure with molecular chains lying parallel but not aligned head to head with each other. At a higher crystallisation temperature the molecules packed in a double layered structure and at an even higher temperature in a typical non-folded but tilted single-molecular layer pattern.   Unit cell determination was performed for a short oligomer with two bulky end groups, showing the existence of a tetragonal unit cell with different dimensions than the orthorhombic unit cells previously reported for linear PCL without end groups. To gain greater insight into the earliest stages of molecular packing, in situ WAXS measurements were performed using a synchrotron radiation beam and measuring data each 12 s whilst very slowly going from melt to <b>isothermal</b> <b>crystallisation.</b> It was shown that the crystal unit cell was distorted during the first minutes of slow crystallisation, which might either represent a metastable phase or else a highly distorted orthorhombic phase.

Avrami analysis revealed that the poly(L-lactic acid) homopolymer crystal growth was three-dimensional and was unaffected {{by the presence of}} stereocomplex PLA. The PLA copolymer crystals had a transition from an initial sheaflike conformation to three-dimensional growth. Furthermore, the lamellar twisting of the homopolymer was observed at the <b>isothermal</b> <b>crystallisation</b> temperature around 144 C. These findings can be used for future modeling studies to predict material behavior in various industrial processes...|$|R

30|$|Unsteady MHD free {{convection}} and mass transfer from a viscous, incompressible, electrically conducting and heat absorbing fluid flow past a vertical infinite flat plate is investigated. The flow is induced by a general time-dependent {{movement of the}} vertical plate, and the cases of ramped temperature <b>and</b> <b>isothermal</b> plates are studied. Exact solutions of the governing equations are obtained. The Sherwood number, Nusselt number and skin friction coefficients are obtained for both ramped temperature <b>and</b> <b>isothermal</b> plates. Some applications of practical interest are discussed for different types of plate motions. The numerical values of species concentration, fluid temperature and fluid velocity are displayed graphically whereas the numerical values of Sherwood number, the Nusselt number and skin friction are presented in tabular form, for different parameter values for both ramped <b>and</b> <b>isothermal</b> plates.|$|R

40|$|Effects of Hall current on {{unsteady}} MHD {{natural convection}} flow of a viscous, incompressible, electrically conducting and heat absorbing fluid past an impulsively moving vertical plate with ramped wall temperature in a porous medium, {{in the presence}} of thermal diffusion, is studied. The exact solution of momentum and energy equations, under Boussinesq approximation, is obtained in closed form by Laplace transform technique for both ramped temperature <b>and</b> <b>isothermal</b> plates. Solution is also obtained in the case of unit Prandtl number for both ramped temperature <b>and</b> <b>isothermal</b> plates. The expressions for skin friction due to primary and secondary flows and Nusselt number for both ramped temperature <b>and</b> <b>isothermal</b> plates are also derived. Mathematical formulation of the problem, in non-dimensional form, contains six pertinent flow parameters viz. M^ 2 (magnetic parameter), m (Hall current parameter) Gr (Grashof number), K 1 (permeability parameter), Pr (Prandtl number) and Phi (heat absorption coefficient). The numerical values of primary and secondary fluid velocities are displayed graphically versus boundary layer coordinate y for various values of m, Gr, K 1, Phi and t while that of fluid temperature are presented in graphical form versus y for different values of Pr, Phi and t for both ramped temperature <b>and</b> <b>isothermal</b> plates. For both ramped temperature <b>and</b> <b>isothermal</b> plates, the numerical values of skin friction due to primary and secondary flows are presented in tabular form for various values of m, Gr, K 1, Phi and t whereas that of Nusselt number are given in tables for different values of Pr, Phi and t. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Modelling the {{evolution}} of the Earth system on long timescales requires the knowledge and understanding of driving mechanisms, such as the hydrological cycle. This is dominant in all components of the Earth’s system, such as atmosphere, ocean, land surfaces/vegetation and the cryosphere. Observations and measurements of stable water isotopes in climate archives can help to decipher and reconstruct climate change and its regional variations. For the cryosphere, the δ 18 O cycle in the current generation of Earth-System-Models is missing and an efficient and accurate tracer transport scheme is required. We describe ISOPOLIS 1. 0 a modular semi-Lagrangian transport scheme of second-order accuracy, which is coupled to the <b>polythermal</b> <b>and</b> thermomechanical ice sheet model SICOPOLIS (version 2. 9). Model skill is demonstrated by experiments with a simplified ice sheet geometry and by comparisons of simulated ice cores with data from Greenland (GRIP) and Antarctica (Vostok). The presented method is a valuable tool to investigate the transport of any kind of passive tracer inside a <b>polythermal</b> ice sheet <b>and</b> is an important step to model the whole δ 18 O cycle...|$|R

Carnot constructed such a reversible heat engine by combining adiabatic <b>and</b> <b>isothermal</b> processes for a system containing an ideal gas. Here, we present {{an example of a}} cyclic engine based on a single quantum-mechanical particle confined to a potential well. The efficiency of this engine is shown to equal the Carnot efficiency because quantum dynamics is reversible.

It was thus observed that the traditional design practice that relies on IF testing at the Tmax {{is bound to be}} nonconservative for the above steel, which could lead to adverse consequences on structural integrity.
