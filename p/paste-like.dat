5|$|While growing, Azotobacter {{produces}} flat, slimy, <b>paste-like</b> colonies with {{a diameter}} of 5–10mm, which may form films in liquid nutrient media. The colonies can be dark-brown, green, or other colors, or may be colorless, depending on the species. The growth is favored at a temperature of 20–30°C.|$|E
5|$|Solitary {{bees are}} {{important}} pollinators; they gather pollen to provision their nests with food for their brood. Often it {{is mixed with}} nectar to form a <b>paste-like</b> consistency. Some solitary bees have advanced types of pollen-carrying structures on their bodies. A very few species of solitary bees are being cultured for commercial pollination. Most of these species belong to a distinct set of genera which are commonly known by their nesting behavior or preferences, namely: carpenter bees, sweat bees, mason bees, polyester bees, squash bees, dwarf carpenter bees, leafcutter bees, alkali bees and digger bees.|$|E
60|$|Looking around me, I was {{inclined}} to {{think that that was}} not improbable. It was too dark to see far, but what I could see was anything but promising. The country was perfectly flat, dreary, and barren, and the view was unbroken by tree, or hedge, or hill. By {{the side of the road}} was a small canal, over the sullen waters of which, and across the road, brooded spectral-like clouds of mist. The rain still fell rapidly, and the wheels of our cart ran noiselessly in the sandy, <b>paste-like</b> mud.|$|E
60|$|This good {{wholesome}} {{woman could}} hardly fail {{to have her}} mind drawn strongly towards Silas Marner, now that he appeared {{in the light of}} a sufferer; and one Sunday afternoon she took her little boy Aaron with her, and went to call on Silas, carrying in her hand some small lard-cakes, flat <b>paste-like</b> articles much esteemed in Raveloe. Aaron, an apple-cheeked youngster of seven, with a clean starched frill which looked like a plate for the apples, needed all his adventurous curiosity to embolden him against the possibility that the big-eyed weaver might do him some bodily injury; and his dubiety was much increased when, on arriving at the Stone-pits, they heard the mysterious sound of the loom.|$|E
60|$|I eagerly inquired what {{quantity}} he {{had brought}} with him, when rummaging once more beneath his garment, he produced a small handful of something so soft, pulpy, and discoloured, that {{for a few moments}} he was as much puzzled as myself to tell by what possible instrumentality such a villanous compound had become engendered in his bosom. I can only describe it as a hash of soaked bread and bits of tobacco, brought to a doughy consistency by the united agency of perspiration and rain. But repulsive as it might otherwise have been, I now regarded it as an invaluable treasure, and proceeded with great care to transfer this <b>paste-like</b> mass to a large leaf which I had plucked from a bush beside me. Toby informed me that in the morning he had placed two whole biscuits in his bosom, with a view of munching them, should he feel so inclined, during our flight. These were now reduced to the equivocal substance which I had just placed on the leaf.|$|E

50|$|The Potato Harvest depicts peasants {{working in}} the plains between Barbizon and Chailly. It {{presents}} a theme representative of the peasants' struggle for survival. Millet's technique for this work incorporated <b>paste-like</b> pigments thickly applied over a coarsely textured canvas.|$|E
50|$|The {{two-cylinder}} {{ball valve}} pump is suitable for in the low to middle pressure range for pumping highly liquid to <b>paste-like</b> media provided these can be sucked in through the valve openings - for example mortars, mineral and sewage sludges.|$|E
50|$|Polymethylsiloxane polyhydrate (PMSPH) is a {{material}} use for sorption detoxification. It acts as sorbent for binding toxic substances of various natures, pathogens and metabolites in the gastrointestinal tract and their excretion. PMSPH is a homogeneous <b>paste-like</b> mass of white or almost white color, odorless.|$|E
50|$|Haleem {{is made of}} wheat, barley, meat (usually {{minced meat}} of beef or mutton or chicken), lentils and spices, {{sometimes}} rice is also used. This dish is slow cooked for seven to eight hours, which results in a <b>paste-like</b> consistency, blending the flavors of spices, meat, barley and wheat.|$|E
50|$|Aliens (group 2): a different, more {{powerful}} group of fly-like aliens appeared in episodes 15-26. These aliens possess more advanced weapons, {{being able to}} fire an unidentified yellow <b>paste-like</b> acid from their snouts, {{and being able to}} alter their revived creatures' genetic material and turn them into giants.|$|E
50|$|In Brazil, the cashew {{fruit juice}} is popular. Brazilians prefer the fruit to the nut. In Panama, the cashew fruit is cooked {{with water and}} sugar for a {{prolonged}} {{time to make a}} sweet, brown, <b>paste-like</b> dessert called dulce de marañón, with marañón as a Spanish name for cashew.|$|E
5000|$|A green {{chemistry}} procedure was recently developed using solvent-free conditions: resorcinol, an aldehyde, and p-toluenesulfonic acid are ground {{together in a}} mortar and pestle at low temperature. A <b>paste-like</b> solid forms upon sitting for several minutes, which can be washed with water and crystallized to give the desired resorcinarene.|$|E

50|$|Seat valve {{pumps are}} {{suitable}} for an especially even pumping of media with a solids content of up to 50% and for the high-pressure pumping of <b>paste-like</b> industrial media such as sludges. Since valves are used in this two-cylinder pump it is suitable for grain sizes up to 8mm at most.|$|E
50|$|It {{can be made}} in 2 to 3 days through {{fermentation}} of boiled soybeans, adding Bacillus subtilis, {{which is}} usually contained in the air or in the rice straw, at about 40°C without adding salt, compared with the much longer fermentation period required for doenjang, another, less pungent variety of Korean soybean paste. Like many forms of doenjang, cheonggukjang is <b>paste-like</b> in texture, but also includes some whole, uncrushed soybeans.|$|E
50|$|Once cleaned of {{impurities}} and extracted, shilajit is {{a homogeneous}} brown-black <b>paste-like</b> substance, with a glossy surface, a peculiar smell and bitter taste. Dry shilajit density ranges from 1.1 to 1.8 g/cm3. It has a plastic-like behavior, at a temperature lower than 20°C (68°F) it will solidify and will soften when warmed. It easily dissolves in water without leaving any residue, {{and it will}} soften when worked between the fingers.|$|E
50|$|Potassium bitartrate can {{be mixed}} with an acidic liquid such as lemon juice or white vinegar {{to make a}} <b>paste-like</b> {{cleaning}} agent for metals such as brass, aluminum or copper, or with water for other cleaning applications such as removing light stains from porcelain.This mixture is sometimes mistakenly made with vinegar and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), which actually react to neutralize each other, creating carbon dioxide and a sodium acetate solution.|$|E
5000|$|The dish is {{prepared}} in two steps. First, flours of sorghum and/or millet are cooked in advance, often by stir-frying. When a customer orders the dish, hot water is poured {{into a bowl}} containing the flour(s) to create a <b>paste-like</b> mush, which is served with white and/or brown sugar and sweet osmanthus sauce ( [...] ; pinyin: guìhuā jiàng). The sweet osmanthus plant is not native to northern China.|$|E
50|$|The apostasioid orchids are {{the most}} {{primitive}} orchids, with only two genera. Neuwiedia has three fertile, abaxial (= facing away from the stem) anthers, while Apostasia has two fertile abaxial anthers and a filamentous staminode (= a sterile stamen). Plants with mealy or <b>paste-like</b> pollen, which ordinarily are not aggregated into pellets, called pollinia, {{with two or three}} fertile long anthers, leaves with sheathing bases, elongated staminode and labellum similar to the petals.|$|E
50|$|Moi- moi is an African dish {{peculiar}} to Yoruba tribe in the South-western Nigeria. Moi- moi {{is made from}} beans after decortication by rubbing the soaked beans against the palms, washed thoroughly and milled with milling machine into a <b>paste-like</b> consistency with African Pepper and onions and afterwards portioned into leaves or low-density polyethylene bag and cooked for about 30 minutes. It is usually eaten as an accompaniment with Pap (Ogi/Akamu) or tapioca.|$|E
50|$|Manufacturers {{of canned}} coconut milk {{typically}} combine diluted and comminuted milk {{with the addition}} of water as a filler. Depending on the brand and age of the milk itself, a thicker, more <b>paste-like</b> consistency floats {{to the top of the}} can and is sometimes separated and used in recipes that require coconut cream rather than coconut milk. Some brands sold in Western countries add thickening agents or emulsifiers to prevent the milk from separating inside the can.|$|E
50|$|The 3D printer head or 3D printer {{extruder}} {{is a part}} {{in material}} extrusion-type printing responsible for raw material melting and forming it into a continuous profile. A wide variety of materials are extruded, including thermoplastics such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polylactic acid (PLA), high-impact polystyrene (HIPS), thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), aliphatic polyamides (nylon), and recently also PEEK. <b>Paste-like</b> materials such as ceramics and chocolate can be extruded using the fused filament process and a paste extruder.|$|E
50|$|Poi has a <b>paste-like</b> texture, a {{delicate}} flavor, and a pale purple color. The flavor changes distinctly once the poi has been made. Fresh poi is sweet and edible all by itself. Each day thereafter the poi loses sweetness and turns slightly sour, {{due to a}} natural fermentation that involves lactobacillus, yeast and Geotrichum. The speed of this fermentation process depends upon the bacteria level in the poi. To slow the souring process, poi was stored in a cool, dark location.|$|E
50|$|The rest of {{the cooked}} dough is kneaded again into a <b>paste-like</b> {{consistency}} and mixed with yeast to ferment into the omegi sul. In this way, the original form of omegi tteok {{was never meant to}} be preserved {{for a long time and}} sold in a shop. In fact, the cooked chajo dough becomes hard and inedible even after just a day of being left to chill. Hence, the modern variety of omegi tteok has changed significantly in both form and taste.|$|E
5000|$|Lead-acid cells {{consist of}} two plates of lead, which serve as electrodes, {{suspended}} in an electrolyte consisting of diluted sulfuric acid. VRLA cells {{have the same}} chemistry. [...] "Wet cell" [...] type VRLA's contain acid in liquid form. In AGM and Gel type VRLA's, the electrolyte is immobilized. In AGM this is accomplished with a fiberglass mat; in Gel batteries or [...] "Gel cells", the electrolyte {{is in the form}} of a <b>paste-like</b> gel created by adding silica and other gelling agents to the electrolyte.|$|E
50|$|A sweet roll or sweet bun {{refers to}} any {{of a number of}} sweet, baked, yeast-leavened breakfast or dessert foods. They may contain spices, nuts, candied fruits, etc., and are often glazed or topped with icing. Compared to regular bread dough, sweet roll dough {{generally}} has higher levels of sugar, fat, eggs, and yeast. They are often round, and are small enough to comprise a single serving. These differ from pastries, which are made from a <b>paste-like</b> batter; from cakes, which are typically unleavened or chemically leavened; and from doughnuts, which are deep fried.|$|E
50|$|A {{traditional}} haleem {{is made by}} firstly soaking wheat, barley and gram lentil overnight. A spicy meat gravy called Korma {{is prepared}} until the meat becomes tender. The wheat, barley and gram are boiled in salt water until they are tender. The cooked wheat, barley and lentils are then mixed with the meat (Beef or Mutton or Chicken) gravy and blended with a heavy hand mixer to obtain a <b>paste-like</b> consistency. The cooking procedure takes about 6 hours to be completed. However, haleem preparation varies in different regions.|$|E
50|$|Screen {{printing}} {{is appropriate}} for fabricating electrics and electronics due to its ability to produce patterned, thick layers from <b>paste-like</b> materials. This method can produce conducting lines from inorganic materials (e.g. for circuit boards and antennas), but also insulating and passivating layers, whereby layer thickness {{is more important than}} high resolution. Its 50 m²/h throughput and 100 µm resolution are similar to inkjets. This versatile and comparatively simple method is used mainly for conductive and dielectric layers, but also organic semiconductors, e.g. for OPVCs, and even complete OFETs can be printed.|$|E
50|$|Tostones are salted {{and eaten}} much like potato chips/crisps or French fries/chips. In some regions, it is {{customary}} to dip them in mojo (a garlic sauce) or ají, or in Colombia {{they are sometimes}} served with hogao sauce. In Costa Rica, they are often eaten with a <b>paste-like</b> dip made from black beans. In some countries, they are served topped with cheese as an appetizer, or with shrimp ceviche, pulled chicken, or avocado salad. They can also be bought prepared from supermarkets. This food is found in all varieties of Caribbean cuisine.|$|E
50|$|Zimmerit was a <b>paste-like</b> coating used on mid- and late-war German armored {{fighting}} vehicles during World War II. It {{was used}} to produce a hard layer covering the metal armor of the vehicle, providing enough separation that magnetically attached anti-tank mines would fail {{to stick to the}} vehicle, although Germany was the only country to use magnetic anti-tank mines in numbers. Zimmerit was often left off late-war vehicles due to the unfounded concern that it could catch fire when hit. It was developed by the German company Chemische Werke Zimmer AG.|$|E

5000|$|The liver detoxifies {{and breaks}} down chemicals, poisons and other toxins that enter the body. For example, the liver {{transforms}} ammonia (which is poisonous) into urea in fish, amphibians and mammals, and into uric acid in birds and reptiles. Urea is filtered by the kidney into urine {{or through the}} gills in fish and tadpoles. Uric acid is <b>paste-like</b> and expelled as a semi-solid waste (the [...] "white" [...] in bird excrements). The liver also produces bile, and the body uses bile to break down fats into usable fats and unusable waste.|$|E
5000|$|Purées {{overlap with}} other dishes with similar consistency, such as thick soups, creams (crèmes) and gravies—although these terms often imply more complex recipes and cooking processes. Coulis (French for [...] "strained") {{is a similar}} but broader term, more {{commonly}} used for fruit purées. The term is not commonly used for <b>paste-like</b> foods prepared from cereal flours, such as gruel or muesli; nor with oily nut pastes, such as peanut butter. The term [...] "paste" [...] is often used for purées intended {{to be used as}} an ingredient, rather than eaten.|$|E
50|$|Sucralfate is {{a locally}} acting {{substance}} {{that in an}} acidic environment (pH < 4) reacts with hydrochloric acid in the stomach to form a cross-linking, viscous, <b>paste-like</b> material capable of acting as an acid buffer {{for as long as}} 6 to 8 hours after a single dose. It also attaches to proteins on the surface of ulcers, such as albumin and fibrinogen, to form stable insoluble complexes. These complexes serve as protective barriers at the ulcer surface, preventing further damage from acid, pepsin, and bile. In addition, sucralfate prevents back diffusion of hydrogen ions, and adsorbs both pepsin and bile acids.|$|E
