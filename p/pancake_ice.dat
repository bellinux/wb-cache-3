2500|$|The {{term used}} for [...] "marine lung" [...] (pleumōn thalattios) appears {{to refer to}} {{jellyfish}} of the type the ancients called sea-lung. The latter are mentioned by Aristotle in On the Parts of Animals as being free-floating and insensate. They are not further identifiable from what Aristotle says but some pulmones appear in Pliny as a class of insensate sea animal; specifically the halipleumon ("salt-water lung"). William Ogle, Aristotle's translator and annotator, attributes the name sea-lung to the lung-like expansion and contraction of the Medusae, a kind of Cnidaria, during locomotion. The ice resembled floating circles in the water. The modern term for this phenomenon is <b>pancake</b> <b>ice.</b>|$|E
60|$|Ice commences {{to form in}} {{the shape}} of needles, which shoot out at angles from each other. In smooth water, under the {{influence}} of intense cold, the process is rapid, and a thin cake soon covers the water, and increases in thickness hour by hour. But when the sea is agitated the process is retarded, and the fine needles are broken up into what arctic navigators call sludge. This, however, soon begins to cake, and is broken by the swell into small cakes; which, as they thicken, again unite, and are again broken up into larger masses. These masses, by rubbing against each other, have their edges slightly rounded up, and in this form receive the name of <b>pancake</b> <b>ice.</b>|$|E

Though much {{too small to be}} discernible by the naked eye, they occurred in such countless myriads as to stain the berg and the pack ice wherever they were washed by the swell of the sea; and, when enclosed in the congealing surface of the water, they imparted to the brash and <b>pancake</b> <b>ice</b> a pale ochreous colour. In the open ocean, northward of the frozen zone, this order, though no doubt almost universally present, generally eludes the search of the naturalist; except when its species are congregated amongst that mucous scum which is sometimes seen floating on the waves, and of whose real nature we are ignorant; or when the coloured contents of the marine animals who feed on these Algae are examined. To the south, however, of the belt of ice which encircles the globe, between the parallels of 50° and 70° S., and in the waters comprised between that belt and the highest latitude ever attained by man, this vegetation is very conspicuous, from the contrast between its colour and the white snow and ice in which it is imbedded. Insomuch, that in the eightieth degree, all the surface ice carried along by the currents, the sides of every berg and the base of the great Victoria Barrier itself, within reach of the swell, were tinged brown, as if the polar waters were charged with oxide of iron.|$|E

50|$|In rough water, fresh sea ice {{is formed}} by the cooling of the ocean as heat is lost into the atmosphere. The {{uppermost}} layer of the ocean is supercooled to slightly below the freezing point, at which time tiny ice platelets (frazil ice) form. With time, this process leads to a mushy surface layer, known as grease ice. Frazil ice formation may also be started by snowfall, rather than supercooling. Waves and wind then act to compress these ice particles into larger plates, of several meters in diameter, called <b>pancake</b> <b>ice.</b> These float on the ocean surface, and collide with one another, forming upturned edges. In time, the <b>pancake</b> <b>ice</b> plates may themselves be rafted over one another or frozen together into a more solid ice cover, known as consolidated <b>pancake</b> <b>ice.</b> Such ice has a very rough appearance on top and bottom.|$|E

50|$|New ice is {{a general}} term used for {{recently}} frozen sea water that does not yet make up solid ice. It may consist of frazil ice (plates or spicules of ice suspended in water), slush (water saturated snow), or shuga (spongy white ice lumps a few centimeters across). Other terms, such as grease ice and <b>pancake</b> <b>ice,</b> are used for ice crystal accumulations under the action of wind and waves.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{formation}} {{mechanisms of}} sea ice have been identified. At its earliest stages, sea iceconsists of elongated, randomly oriented crystals. This is called frazil and mixed with water inthe unconsolidated state {{is known as}} grease ice.

40|$|Stereo imaging is used {{to measure}} surface waves in two {{different}} experimental setups. First, stereo imaging is used remotely measure waves interacting with three distinct ice types: brash, frazil, and pancake. Along-shore spatial frequency distributions show that <b>pancake</b> and frazil <b>ices</b> attenuate higher frequency waves faster than lower frequency waves, causing a decrease in mean frequency. In contrast, wave propagation through brash ice causes a rapid increase in dominant wave frequency, {{believed to be the}} result a non-linear energy transfer to higher frequencies caused by collisions between the brash ice particles. Total wave energy flux was observed to decrease exponentially in both <b>pancake</b> and frazil <b>ice,</b> whereas total energy flux remained constant in the brash ice due to thin layer thickness. Spatial energy flux distributions also reveal that wave reflection occurs at the boundary of each ice layer, with reflection strongest at the pancake/ice-free and frazil/brash interfaces and weakest at the brash/ice-free interface. These high resolution observations demonstrate the spatially variable nature of waves propagating through ice. Second, efficient flexible-baseline stereo imaging is developed to study boat wakes and Langmuir circulation over range of scale (up to 1000 m 2). Given the difficulty associated with obtaining ground control points over a water surface, determining the exterior camera orientation is generally {{the most difficult part of}} field calibration. The innovative calibration technique accomplishes this using a two step process where exterior orientation is first estimated using a total station and then refined using a series of geometric and epipolar constraints. Processing times are also reduced using phase-only correlation and parallel processing. The first experiment explores the wake patterns generated by boats moving at different speeds. Analysis includes maximum wave height, crest length, wake angle, and interaction with ambient waves. Results processed using the new technique measured a water surface displacement time series to within 1. 2 cm mean absolute error when compared with a wire wave gauge which is on the order of the camera resolution. The second experiment investigates waves in the presence of Langmuir circulation, including orientation of Langmuir cells to wave direction and influence on wave energy. Overall EFSI increases the applicability of stereo imaging to measure surface waves...|$|R

50|$|In the Arctic, a {{key area}} where <b>pancake</b> <b>ice</b> forms the {{dominant}} ice type over an entire region {{is the so-called}} Odden ice tongue in the Greenland Sea. The Odden (the word is Norwegian for the headland) grows eastward from the main East Greenland ice edge {{in the vicinity of}} 72-74°N during the winter {{because of the presence of}} very cold polar surface water in the Jan Mayen Current, which diverts some water eastward from the East Greenland Current at that latitude. Most of the old ice continues south, driven by the wind, so a cold open water surface is exposed on which new ice forms as frazil and pancake in the rough seas.|$|E
50|$|The Odden had {{a length}} of about 1,300 km and covered an area of up to 330,000 km² in most years.

The salt rejected back into the ocean from this ice formation caused the surface water to become denser and sink, sometimes to great depths (2500 m or more), making this one of the few regions of the ocean where winter convection occurred, which helped drive the entire worldwide system of surface and deep currents known as the thermohaline circulation. Since the 1990s, the Odden Ice Tongue rarely develops.|$|E
40|$|Sea ice {{frequently}} {{forms in}} wavy waters. Wave motion packs forming ice crystals into small floes, while the ice attenuates the waves as the ice floes increase {{in diameter and}} thickness. Swell has been reported up to a few hundred kilometres inside the ice pack. Because of ocean waves, young ice floes take a rounded shape that led hungry early explorers {{to give them the}} name of <b>pancake</b> <b>ice.</b> Observations suggest that <b>pancake</b> <b>ice</b> thickness grows up to twice as fast as for ice forming in quiet seas. In this work we try to evaluate whether future large-scale sea-ice models should include wave–ice interactions to properly simulate large-scale distributions of ice concentration and thickness. In the large-scale 3 -D ice–ocean modelling system NEMO-LIM, a representation of <b>pancake</b> <b>ice</b> formation is included. First, the ERA- 40 ocean wave climatology is extrapolated in the sea-ice zone as if the ocean was ice-free. After diagnosing the simulated ice edge, ocean waves are propagated from the ice edge further inside the ice pack assuming exponential decay of amplitude. Finally, the thickness of newly forming ice is computed as a function of wave amplitude, as given by the equilibrium <b>pancake</b> <b>ice</b> theory. Wavelength is prescribed, which is a strong limitation of the model. In the model, <b>pancake</b> <b>ice</b> formation is found important in regions located in the vicinity of open ocean, namely the Southern Ocean and, in the Arctic, the Bering, Okhostk and Greenland Seas. <b>Pancake</b> <b>ice</b> formation accelerates the ice-edge progression, reduces winter ice concentration and, in turn, enhances ice production and thickness, in particular in the Southern Ocean. In some regions, the ocean responds to changes in ice production and modifies the location of the ice edge, as in East Antarctica. Wave–ice interaction parameters (wave attenuation, equilibrium pancake thickness, …) have a key impact on the simulated response of the model. Given the uncertainty in the model parameters, we conclude that more work is required to couple ocean waves and sea ice in large-scale models...|$|E

40|$|As {{part of the}} European Subpolar Ocean Programme (ESOP), the German {{research}} icebreaker Polarstern {{worked in}} the Greenland Sea in the late winter of 1993. Whilst on passage, the ship encountered a severe winter storm with winds consistently above 20 m s(- 1) coupled to air temperatures of below - 10 degrees C. The underway sensors revealed heat fluxes of greater than 700 W m(- 2) across most of the Nordic Basin, peaking at greater than 1200 W m(- 2) when the ship crossed the cold, fresh water of the Jan Mayen Current. This large heat flux coupled to the unique hydrographic conditions present in the Jan Mayen Current allowed sea-ice generation {{in the form of}} frazil ice at a rate of 28 cm d(- 1). This frazil ice then developed into <b>pancake</b> <b>ice.</b> Measurements also were made in the late winter beneath this <b>pancake</b> <b>ice</b> in two remnants of the Odden. In the Jan Mayen Current, hydrographic conditions are such that the ice can exist {{for a long period of}} time before eventually decaying due to short-wave radiation at the surface. Towards the centre of the Greenland Sea, hydrographic measurements reveal that the ice is more transient and decays four times more rapidly than ice in the Jan Mayen Current. We discuss the development of the Odden ice tongue in light of these results and add evidence to the argument that the eventual fate of the water stored in the ice is important and could be a relevant factor in the formation of Greenland Sea Deep Water.

40|$|The {{formation}} of sea {{ice in the}} presence of turbulence was studied using data from drifting buoy deployments and ice sampling in the Weddell Sea during April 2000. The study sought to improve understanding of <b>pancake</b> <b>ice</b> in terms of dynamics, heat fluxes, ice growth rates and mechanisms. Ice motion at high frequencies was examined using GPS buoy positions at a 20 -minute sampling interval. Relative motions of the buoy array were characterised by a marked oscillation at the highest frequencies, with an RMS value two orders of magnitude higher than previously seen in the Weddell Sea. This motion ceased overnight as the pancakes consolidated. Wave forcing, either surface gravity or internal, was postulated as the cause. The oscillation was found to significantly influence the proportions of pancake and frazil ice, though the nature of the ice cover meant that ice production rates were unaffected, in contrast to the enhanced growth this would imply for congelation ice. Momentum transfer parameters were found to be similar to those found for the Greenland Sea Odden ice tongue. Pancakes were found to be dominantly thickened by over-topping of the surrounding frazil ice crystals, termed ‘scavenging’, and gave rise to distinct morphologies, which were classified. A physical model was developed to describe the evolution of the <b>pancake</b> <b>ice</b> cover to consolidation. Ice production in the pancake/frazil process was found to proceed at approximately double the rate of the equivalent congelation ice cover, or 0. 58 times the limiting free-surface frazil production. It was suggested that the discrepancy will seriously impact largescale modelling attempts to simulate heat and momentum fluxes between the ocean and atmosphere, as well as salt rejection and subsequent water mass modification, though it is acknowledged that further field measurements are required to place some currently empirical parameters into a physical context...|$|E
