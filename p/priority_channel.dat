40|$|Abstract—The {{enhanced}} distributed channel access (EDCA) of IEEE 802. 11 e {{has been}} standardized to support {{quality of service}} (QoS) in wireless local area networks (LANs). The EDCA statistically supports the QoS by differentiating the probability of channel access among different priority traffic and does not provide the deterministically prioritized channel access for high-priority traffic, such as voice or real-time video. Therefore, lower priority traffic still affects the performance of higher priority traf-fic. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective scheme called deterministic <b>priority</b> <b>channel</b> access (DPCA) to improve the QoS performance of the EDCA mechanism. To provide guaranteed channel access to multimedia applications, the proposed scheme uses a busy tone to limit the transmissions of lower priority traffic when higher priority traffic has packets to send.

40|$|Abstract—The co-channel {{interference}} (CCI) limits {{the capacity of}} wireless networks due to {{the limited number of}} available channels {{and the fact that the}} same channel must be reused in the system. Recently, we proposed the interference-aware channel segregation based dynamic channel assignment (IACS-DCA). Stable channel reuse pattern can be formed in a distributed manner which can minimize the CCI experienced at access points (APs) or base stations (BSs). In this paper, we introduce a multi-channel access technique for the IACS-DCA. Each AP has channel priority table, in which the channels are listed by the ascending order of average CCI power. Original IACS-DCA assumes the single channel access using the first <b>priority</b> <b>channel</b> with the lowest average CCI power. By using multiple channels at the same time in the descending priority order, more number of users can access an AP. However, the use of channels below the first orders at the same time increases the CCI and may make the channel reuse pattern unstable. We examine, by computer simulation, the channel reuse pattern and confirm that the IACS-DCA improves the signal-to-interference power ratio (SIR) even with multi-channel access compared to the conventional quasi-DCA using multi-channel access.

The protocol utilises the principles of channel reser-vation, extended channel sub-rating and priority queueing subject to a buffer threshold based generalized partial sharing (GPS) traffic handling scheme. The impact of the 4 G HAND-OFF protocol {{on the performance of}} the 4 G cellular network can be assessed via an open queueing network model (QNM) consisting of five generalised exponential (GE) -type queueing and delay systems subject to a GPS traffic handling scheme.

30|$|Recently, {{interest}} for cognitive radio networks (CRNs) to provide applications with stringent delay constraints has increased [1 – 5]. Nonetheless, providing {{this type of}} services is challenging due to the unpredictable nature of channel availability [3]. Several mechanisms have been proposed to reduce service interruption and/or to provide quality of service (QoS) provisioning in CRNs [3, 4, 6]. Among the most relevant of these mechanisms are spectrum handoff, call buffering, preemptive <b>priority,</b> <b>channel</b> reservation, spectrum adaptation, and spectrum leasing [4, 7 – 9]. Several research {{studies have shown that}} enabling leasing mechanisms allows to achieve a better QoS related to the secondary users (SUs) in coordinated cognitive radio networks (CCRNs) [9 – 19]. A CCRN is formed by primary, secondary, and leasing sub-networks [5]. In the literature, the primary and leasing networks are fused in the same network [9]. The spectrum leasing mechanism means that the leasing sub-network rents to the secondary network part of its spectrum in exchange of some incentive (e.g., monetary rewards as leasing payments) [11]. The leased spectrum band could be purchased, or it could be leased as requested by the administrator of the secondary network. Under dynamic spectrum leasing regime, whenever the secondary network needs to rent more resources, it sends a request to the leasing network. The leasing network accepts or rejects such requests according to the availability of the resources in its network. To reduce the economic cost of renting resources through spectrum leasing, channels should be rented only when needed and should be released as soon as they are no longer needed. However, thanks to the random nature of channel occupancy, the resources to be leased cannot be guaranteed. To avoid this problem, in this paper, an anticipated leasing mechanism is proposed to increase the probability to find available channels to lease when needed.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the challenging problem of guaranteeing quality-of-service (QoS) requirements associated with parallel running queries in distributed stream processing engines. In such platforms, the real-time processing of streaming data often requires executing {{a set of}} user-defined queries over continues data flows. However, previous studies showed that guaranteeing QoS enforcement (such as end-to-end response time) for a collection of applications is a complex problem. This paper presents an advanced resource allocation strategy to tackle such a problem by considering the traffic pattern of individual data streams. To properly allocate resource for streaming queries execution, we define {{a certain number of}} <b>priority</b> <b>channels</b> to categorize the streaming data across the system. The resource allocation is addressed as an optimization problem where a set of cost functions is defined to achieve the following goals: a) reduce the sum of QoS violation incidents across all applications; b) increase the CPU utilization level, and (c) avoid the additional costs caused by frequent reconfigurations. The proposed solution does not depend on any assumption about the incoming data rate or the query processing time. The performance of the proposed solution is benchmarked, and the experimental results reveal that the proposed scheme increases the overall resource utilization by 23 % on average and reduces the QoS violations by 29 % against round-robin strategy. It could also prevent QoS violation incidents at different levels by tuning the cost function...|$|R
