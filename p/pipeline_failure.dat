Due {{to the fact}} that it’s difficult to capture the relationship between the physical and economical aspects as a result of critical sewer <b>pipelines</b> <b>failure,</b> economic concepts are used to evaluate the economic loss {{as a result of these}} failures. In this paper an analysis for the costs resulting from sewer <b>pipelines</b> <b>failure</b> and the benefits achieved from avoiding failures are presented. The costs included in the cost benefit analysis are the direct costs used to reinstate failed pipelines and the indirect costs, borne by the society and economy. In the benefits analysis, only the tangible and measurable benefits limited to the health sector and preventing diseases are addressed in this paper. It is expected that the proposed approach could help in estimating the economic losses due to sewer <b>pipelines</b> <b>failure</b> especially for the intangible factors that are difficult to measure. In addition it could help decision makers in taking necessary measures to preserve critical assets that could have adverse potential impacts on valuable natural resources such as surface and groundwater and soil surrounding failed pipelines...|$|R

5000|$|Employees {{had raised}} their {{concerns}} {{before the actual}} incident, which were ignored by BP management. In an e-mail to a company lawyer in June 2004, Marc Kovac, {{an official of the}} United Steelworkers union representing workers at the BP facility, forwarded a collection of his earlier complaints to management. One of these, dated February 28, 2003, concerned [...] "corrosion monitoring staffing levels". It began, [...] "The corrosion monitoring crew will soon be reduced to six staff down from eight." [...] Initially BP denied that they took money-saving measures maintaining the pipeline. Robert Malone, the chairman of BP America, cited a report commissioned by BP which concluded that [...] "budget increases alone would not have prevented the leak". He later admitted that there [...] "was a concerted effort to manage the costs in response to the continuing decline in production at Prudhoe Bay". One {{of the reasons for the}} <b>pipeline</b> <b>failure</b> was an insufficient level of corrosion inhibitor, a liquid which resists corrosion of pipeline by the corroding liquid, which is water. John Dingell read from an internal BP email that said budgetary constraints would force the end of a programme to inject corrosion inhibitor directly into the pipeline system. The process of injecting corrosion inhibitor directly into a pipeline, though costly, is much more effective than injecting in a process plant.|$|E

It calls for oil companies to be more forthcoming in regards to pipeline operations and inspections. In addition, municipalities can take more responsibility in training first responders in case of such an event.The report places most of the blame {{on the state of}} Utah itself. The report reads, “Although the federal government is responsible for setting minimum pipeline safety standards, Utah can adopt additional or stricter safety standards." [...] Suggestions for the state legislature include expanding state authority to incorporate all hazardous liquid pipelines and interstate gas transmissions, creating a citizen pipeline safety advisory committee to work with the pipeline industry and regulators on a regular basis, and require excavators and underground utility operators to report all incidents of damage to a pipeline to the Division of Public Utilities. In addition to state legislature improvement, local governments in the Salt Lake Valley could adopt recommendations regarding planning near pipelines from Pipelines and Informed Planning Alliance (PIPA) Report to include at minimum a consultation zone and inclusion of transmission pipelines on planning and zoning maps, ensure emergency response teams have the required equipment, information and training to respond in case of a pipeline emergency, and develop an evacuation plan should an emergency occur. Many improvements to the system are suggested in the report, as there is high probability of another <b>pipeline</b> <b>failure</b> in Utah. From 2002-2011 there were 10 reported incidents of failure in the pipeline systems.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this study, {{aspects of}} {{pipeline}} risk management are researched. The research is exploratory {{in nature and}} {{the focus is on}} discovering a trend between <b>pipeline</b> <b>failure</b> causes and the consequential cost of property damage. The study aims to identify causes of hazardous pipeline failures in the United States of America (USA) and to predict the cost impact of these failures so as to get a better risk picture on this element of operational risk. This study proposes that a systems engineering approach be adopted in applying risk management not only to the project lifecycle but also to the entire product lifecycle. An extensive literature research on systems engineering, risk management, risk analysis and pipeline risk management is conducted. The study then proceeds with the collection and analysis of hazardous <b>pipeline</b> <b>failure</b> data from the United States Department of Transport (US DOT). This data is analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics with the aim of building a multilinear regression model. The research findings which are supported by the data analysis show that the causes of <b>pipeline</b> <b>failure</b> explain a small amount of the variation in the cost of <b>pipeline</b> <b>failure.</b> M.

40|$|Oil and gas {{pipelines}} transport {{millions of dollars}} of goods everyday worldwide. Even though they are the safest way to transport petroleum products, pipelines do still fail generating hazardous consequences and irreparable environmental damages. Many models have been developed in the last decade to predict <b>pipeline</b> <b>failures</b> and conditions. However, most of these models were limited to one failure type, such as corrosion failure, or relied mainly on expert opinion analysis. The objective {{of this paper is to}} develop a model that predicts the failure cause of oil pipelines based on factors other than corrosion. Two models are developed to help decision makers predict failure occurrence. Regression analysis and artificial neural networks (ANNs) models were developed based on historical data of pipeline accidents. The two models were able to satisfactory predict <b>pipeline</b> <b>failures</b> due to mechanical, operational, corrosion, third party and natural hazards with an average validity of 90 % for the regression model and 92 % for the ANN model. The developed models assist decision makers and pipeline operators to predict the expected failure cause(s) and to take the necessary actions to avoid them.
