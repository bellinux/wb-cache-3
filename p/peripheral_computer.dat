40|$|Microsystems are miniaturised {{technical}} {{components in}} dimensions of mm, which consist of mechanical and electronic or optic functions and functional elements. Microsystems {{are used as}} sensors and actuators in different applications for automobiles, medical techniques or <b>peripheral</b> <b>computer</b> equipment. They are manufactured in series or small series. Sensors, actuators and many technical microproducts require components with small dimensional form and surface tolerances in the µm range. If one includes the physical processes, precision starts to reach nano levels. The tolerances of microsystems are defined as functional tolerances. This paper deals with requirements for tolerancing systems for miniaturised components and functional elements. The different criteria and systems as well as basics for possible standards are elaborated. It is even {{a contribution to the}} discussion about the necessity of new tolerancing systems, questions of calibration and the usage of measuring systems to detect deviations in microgeometry, physical characterisation and integration of measurement in industrial manufacturing systems...|$|E

They entail providing different service resources to user clients via networks and other peripheral connections. The {{aim of this}} study was to establish a distance lab environment where distance students and other practitioners could do remote practical testings of client-server products for learning purposes. Throughout this work our theme was on development of remote virtualized client-server topology and subjects it to attack environment for students (distance) learning of security breach concepts of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA) in a practical virtualized lab environment. Main objective of this design research was “to implement a distance based laboratory (virtualized environment) where security for client-server model in a remote and virtualized network of Windows Platform can be implemented and tested. Although security experts argue that systems safety will never be absolute, our main trigger factor was to establish virtualized lab were key security settings will be practically tested and implemented remotely by students for protection of services, data, and other <b>peripheral</b> <b>computer</b> communications. This was part of Lulea University of Technology Virtual War Hack Lab Project to develop a platform for student practical learning and understanding.

40|$|Osteoporosis-related {{vertebral}} fractures {{represent a}} major health problem in elderly populations. Such fractures can often only be diagnosed after a substantial deformation {{history of the}} vertebral body. Therefore, it remains a challenge for clinicians to distinguish between stable and progressive potentially harmful fractures. Accordingly, novel criteria for selection of the appropriate conservative or surgical treatment are urgently needed. Computer tomography-based finite element analysis is an increasingly accepted method to predict the quasi-static vertebral strength and to follow up this small strain property longitudinally in time. A recent development in constitutive modeling allows us to simulate strain localization and densification in trabecular bone under large compressive strains without mesh dependence. The aim of this work was to validate this recently developed constitutive model of trabecular bone for the prediction of strain localization and densification in the human vertebral body subjected to large compressive deformation. A custom-made stepwise loading device mounted in a high resolution <b>peripheral</b> <b>computer</b> tomography system was {{used to describe the}} progressive collapse of 13 human vertebrae under axial compression. Continuum finite element analyses of the 13 compression tests were realized and the zones of high volumetric strain were compared with the experiments. A fair qualitative correspondence of the strain localization zone between the experiment and finite element analysis was achieved in 9 out of 13 tests and significant correlations of the volumetric strains were obtained throughout the range of applied axial compression. Interestingly, the stepwise propagating localization zones in trabecular bone converged to the buckling locations in the cortical shell. While the adopted continuum finite element approach still suffers from several limitations, these encouraging preliminary results towardsthe prediction of extended vertebral collapse may help in assessing fracture stability in future work...|$|E
40|$|Currently, musical {{composition}} {{is considered to}} be a high-level skill that is inaccessible to young children. There is a "high floor" for children who want to create a piece of music because they must learn a way of recording and remembering the notes, their sequence, etc, such as musical notation. Our project explores tangible designs that will make music composition simple to learn and practice while also building an intuition about complex musical concepts. Three original designs of tangible interfaces for {{musical composition}} are introduced and the merits and limitations of each are explored using non-functional form models. Audio processing is performed on a <b>peripheral</b> <b>computer</b> running an audio program written specifically for each system. A "Wizard of Oz" approach was used to study user interactions with each design. Music Blocks are designed to be physical representations of inherently intangible musical notes. Each block represents a single note, and the user can modify its pitch and duration by changing the physical shape of the block. They resemble wooden building blocks and suggest the parallels between building structures and the organization of musical compositions and its melody. The Music Glove introduced the idea of using a sound recording instead of a musical note as the musical unit in a composition. This introduced rich ideas about nesting and recursion. At the same time the glove interface highlights the role of personal expression, interaction and affect in musical composition and performance. Here physical inputs of the system were related to the rhythms, tempos, and the tone of the composition. The system was more gestural, performance-oriented and more suited to spontaneous improvising. The Musical Leaves interface is a melding of the concepts for the Music Blocks and Glove. The individual Leaves reflect the modular structure and organization of the composition. At the same time, the Leaves can be manipulated in real-time to change pitch and volume and as a result are deeply expressive and flexible. by Elysa Wan. Thesis (S. B.)
