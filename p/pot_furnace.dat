Smaller scale furnaces for specialty glasses include electric melters, <b>pot</b> <b>furnaces,</b> and day tanks.After melting, homogenization and refining (removal of bubbles), the glass is formed. Flat glass for windows and similar applications is formed by the float glass process, developed between 1953 and 1957 by Sir Alastair Pilkington and Kenneth Bickerstaff of the UK's Pilkington Brothers, who created a continuous ribbon of glass using a molten tin bath on which the molten glass flows unhindered {{under the influence of}} gravity. The top surface of the glass is subjected to nitrogen under pressure to obtain a polished finish.Container glass for common bottles and jars is formed by blowing and pressing methods. This glass is often slightly modified chemically (with more alumina and calcium oxide) for greater water resistance. Further glass forming techniques are summarized in the table Glass forming techniques.|$|R

50|$|The first {{glass batch}} did not melt properly, and the {{stoneware}} crucible that Littleton {{had made to}} hold the molten glass in the furnace broke apart in the intense heat. Labino suggested that they melt the glass directly in the furnace; he then directed {{the conversion of the}} <b>pot</b> <b>furnace</b> into a small day tank. Instead of trying to melt another load of glass batch, Labino re-charged the furnace with the low-melting formula #475 glass marbles that he had developed for Johns-Manville for the production of fiberglass. The marbles, which melted at a relatively low temperature, produced glass that was malleable enough to blow. This enabled the workshop to continue and, with the craft's technique demonstrated by two retired industrial glassblowers, Harvey Leafgreen and Jim Nelson, participants blew glass around the clock.|$|E
40|$|Grate firing is {{the most}} common way to burn bio-fuels in {{small-scale}} units. Different combustion modes are achieved depending on how fuel and primary air are introduced. In continuous systems fuel and air are usually fed in cross-current and counter-current flow. Here, combustion of wet biofuels is studied in a 31 MW reciprocating grate furnace (a cross-current how combustor), and additional experiments have been made in batch-fired <b>pot</b> <b>furnaces.</b> The fuel was forest waste with moisture content of approximately 50 %. The combustion in a cross-current flow furnace is generally assumed to start by ignition {{on the surface of the}} bed, followed by a reaction front propagating from the surface down to the grate. Measurements and visual observations presented in this paper show, however, that in the case of wet fuels the ignition takes place close to the grate, followed by a reaction front propagating from the grate up to the surface of the bed. Hence, the progress of combustion in the bed is opposite to the expected one...|$|R

40|$|LKAB {{is a state}} owned, Swedish {{mining company}} that {{produces}} iron ore products for the steel making industries, mainly iron ore pellets. The final process of heat treating iron ore pellets, which is done in a Grate-kiln, is the most energy consuming part of the refining process. This {{has led to a}} collaboration between LKAB and the Division of Energy Technology at Chalmers to make the Grate-kiln more energy efficient. With help from an in-house simulation model by LKAB, earlier work within this collaboration has suggested process changes that makes this process more energy efficient. The simulation model describes the heat and mas transfer through the whole Grate-kiln process. The simulation model is believed to perform well under standard running condition, but has difficulty to evaluate the process when large changes are made in the running settings. Therefore, this work has been to validate the simulation model against an experimental test rig, so called <b>pot</b> <b>furnace,</b> where it was the grate performance from the Grate-kiln that was analysed. Measurements were taken from the <b>pot</b> <b>furnace</b> and compared with the calculations from the simulation program. The key parameters and processes used for comparison were the temperatures, the degree of oxidation, the drying process and the pressure drop. The outcome from this study has shown that the results from the simulation model regarding the oxidization process correlate with the measured results from the <b>pot</b> <b>furnace.</b> Temperature measurements from the <b>pot</b> <b>furnace</b> showed a lower value than the simulation model due to the limitations in the <b>pot</b> <b>furnace.</b> Pressure drop is well calculated, but it is concluded that either mismeasurements regarding the pellets in the <b>pot</b> <b>furnace</b> occur or that the simulation model overestimated one or several variables. The drying process has been proved to be the most difficult parameter to predict by the bed model. This partly due to the regulating process in the <b>pot</b> <b>furnace</b> and also calculation faults in the bed model. From this study, further work should focus on these parameters when evaluating the bed model. It should also focus on comparing the simulation model with a new developed <b>pot</b> <b>furnace</b> and also the full scale Grate-kiln process...|$|E

40|$|Metal leaf (gold, silver {{or their}} alloys) glass {{tesserae}} {{began to be}} used in wall mosaics in the first century AD (the first examples are in Rome) and their use has been uninterrupted up to day. The metal leaf could be obtained from circulating coins, jewellery or refining. According to various techniques that have changed over the centuries, the leaf was hot fixed between two glass layers. From an archaeological point of view, it is interesting to know when and where these tesserae were made, if they were new made or if they were reused tesserae recovered from earlier dismantled mosaics. The determination of the glass composition of the tesserae is not of great help in this connection, for the same kind of glass was used over long periods. Available information is still scanter for glasses produced between the 1 st to 8 th centuries when the batch of raw materials (a natural soda called natron and a silica-lime sand) was melted in large tank furnaces and chunks of raw glass were transported all over the Mediterranean to be remelted and shaped into manufacts in small <b>pot</b> <b>furnaces.</b> The SEM-EDS analysis is proposed in this study as a useful tool to investigate the composition of both the glass and the gold alloy in leaf tesserae from mosaics of the 1 st - 9 th centuries. The comparison of the composition of the gold leaf of the tesserae with that of circulating gold coins (for which an important analytical data base is available), adds further information to the glass analysis, allowing us to improve the dating of the tesserae and increase the knowledge that may result from scientific analyses. The results demonstrate that good quantitative analyses of the metal leaf can be performed and that metal leaves made of pure gold or gold-silver alloys were used...|$|R

40|$|A simple {{model of}} bubble {{behaviour}} in a melting {{space with a}} vertical circulation of the molten glass was derived. Subsequently, two cases were considered. The first case with a constant, radially independent value of the angular velocity of the glass-melt rotation approximately demonstrated the heating through {{the wall of the}} <b>pot</b> <b>furnace</b> for glass melting, and the second case, where the angular velocity decreased from the centre of the space towards the wall, represented the heating of the <b>pot</b> <b>furnace</b> from above. The chosen values of the angular velocities corresponded to temperature gradients commonly occurring in melting spaces. The starting positions of critical (last removed) bubbles were sought along with their trajectories and fining times. The much higher calculated fining times of critical bubbles in the rotating melt as compared with the fining times of the bubbles just rising through the quiescent glass melt were explained by the deceleration of the bubble rising with respect to the fixed coordinates through the downward part of the glass vertical circulation. This fact leads to a long retention of the bubble in the melt and consequently to high energy consumption and low melting performance. The semiempirical equations were presented, providing the fining time of the critical bubble {{as a function of the}} bubble-growth rate and melt-rotation velocity...|$|E

40|$|Combustion of wood is {{increasing}} {{because of the}} needs of decreasing the emissions of carbon dioxide and the amount of waste going to landfills. Wood based fuels are often scattered on a large area. The transport distances should be short enough to prevent too high costs, and so the size of heating and power plants using wood fuels is often rather small. Combustion technologies of small-size units have to be developed to reach efficient and environmentally friendly energy production. Furnaces that use different packed bed combustion or gasification techniques areoften most economic in small-scale energy production. Ignition front propagation rate affects the stability, heat release rate and emissions of packed bed combustion. Ignition front propagation against airflow in packed beds of wood fuels has been studied. The research has been carried out mainly experimentally. Theoretical aspects have been considered to draw conclusions about the experimental results. The effects of airflow rate, moisture content of the fuel, size, shape and density of particles, and porosity of the bed on the propagation rate of the ignition front have been studied. The experiments were carried out in a <b>pot</b> <b>furnace.</b> The fuels used in the experiments were mainly real wood fuels that are often burned in the production of energy. The fuel types were thin wood chips, saw dust, shavings, wood chips, and pellets with different sizes. Also a few mixturesof the above were tested. Increase in the moisture content of the fuel decreases the propagation rates of the ignition front and makes the range of possible airflow rates narrower because of the energy needed for the evaporation of water and the dilution of volatile gases due to evaporated steam. Increase in the airflow rate increases the ignition rate until a maximum rate of propagation is reached after which it decreases. The maximum flame propagation rate is not always reached in stoichiometric combustion conditions. Increase in particle size and density transfers the optimum airflow rate towards fuel lean conditions. Mixing of small and large particles is often advantageous, because small particles make itpossible to reach the maximum ignition rate in fuel rich conditions, and large particles widen the range of possible airflow rates. A correlation was found forthe maximum rate of ignition front propagation in different wood fuels. According to the correlation, the maximum ignition mass flux is increased when the sphericity of the particles and the porosity of the bed are increased and the moisture content of the fuel is decreased. Another fit was found between sphericity and porosity. Increase in sphericity decreases the porosity of the bed. The reasons of the observed results are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Biomass {{combustion}} is {{an interesting}} alternative to fossil fuel. Modeling and simulation is used for design optimization of biomass boilers and furnace. It is difficult to develop a sufficiently accurate and computationally efficient model because the combustion system is highly complicated multi-scale, multi-phase and multi-physics problem. The study of biomass combustion in different scales allows engineers to understand the combustion process and tochoose necessary simplification to develop a computationally efficient model. The chemical and physical properties of fuels are altered during different fuel preparation methods (i. e. pretreatment and pelletization), {{and as a result}} the fuel conversion is also affected. The aim of this thesis is to understand thermal conversion of those chemically or physically altered fuels. Both experimental and modeling techniques were chosen to addressthe aim. Experiments were performed in thermogravimetric analysers, isothermal macro thermogravimeters (iTG), and a <b>pot</b> <b>furnace</b> to account fuel conversion in micro-, meso- and macro scale. In addition, three different types of mathematical model were developed. They are (i) a simplified particle pyrolysis model, (ii) two detailed numerical models that simulate particle pyrolysis and char oxidation and (iii) finally a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model of combustion of biomass particles in a bed. The results indicate that both the intrinsic and the apparent conversion of the fuel wasinfluenced by the process conditions of fuel preparation methods. Intrinsic pyrolysis reactivitywas reduced due to mild pretreatment; however, it was increased with further increase in pretreatment severity. In contrary, severity of pelletization tends to reduce the apparent reactivity of pellets combustion. It was also investigated that how each physical and chemical parameter should be modelledfor a untreated biomass (i. e. wood logs) and a densified biomass (i. e. pellets) through parametric studies with a detailed particle simulation. The result shows that a model for wood logs should exclude convective heat transfer by volatiles if the fibers align to longitude direction while it is important part in the models for pellets. Devolatilization of wood logs was expressed as endothermic reactions while the model results showed best agreement withexperimental data of wood pellets when the heat of reaction was assumed to be zero, possibly due to the secondary reactions. Then, it was demonstrated that a constitutive equation, i. e. analytical solution of the shrinking core model, is sufficient to express devolatilization rate of thermally-thick particles at the temperature of 1173 K. While studying apparent oxidation of wood pellet char, it was found that change in intrinsic char oxidation reactivity due to different pyrolysis conditions does not influences the model prediction at high temperature. In addition, at high temperature, the reaction front became thin and reaction rate was hardly affected by temperature. It was also found by the simulation of pellet bed combustion that the apparent density of the particle significantly affected the flame velocity.

50|$|During {{the late}} medieval period, glass {{factories}} {{were set up}} {{where there was a}} ready supply of silica, the essential material for glass manufacture. Silica requires a very high temperature to melt it, something not all glass factories were able to achieve. Such materials as potash, soda, and lead can be added to lower the melting temperature. Other substances, such as lime, are added to rebuild the weakened network and make the glass more stable. Glass is coloured by adding metallic oxide powders or finely divided metals while it is in a molten state. Copper oxides produce green or bluish green, cobalt makes deep blue, and gold produces wine red and violet glass. Much modern red glass is produced using copper, which is less expensive than gold and gives a brighter, more vermilion shade of red.

An appropriate measure that characterises the ventilation within the workshop {{is the number of}} air changes per hour and ideally it should be close to a prescribed value for all weather conditions. This requirement can be met by the appropriate adjustment of the opening angles of the inlet and outlet window slats. This paper reports on the feasibility of using mathematical optimisation to determine the ideal window slat angles for different prevailing wind conditions. The proposed optimisation methodology employs computational fluid dynamics software (FLUENT), coupled to a computationally economic optimisation algorithm (Dynamic-Q), to determine the optimal slat angles.

40|$|There are {{two sources}} of {{contamination}} in solder alloys. The first source is trace elements {{from the primary}} metals used in the as-manufactured product, be that product in ingot, wire, or powder form. Their levels in the primary metal {{are determined by the}} refining process. While some of these trace elements are naturally occurring materials, additional contamination can result from the refining and/or forming processes. Sources include: <b>furnace</b> <b>pot</b> liners, debris on the cutting edges of shears, rolling mill rollers, etc. The types and levels of contaminants per solder alloy are set by recognized industrial, federal, military, and international specifications. For example, the 63 Sn- 37 Pb solder purchased to the ASTM B 32 standard can have maximum levels of contamination for the following metals: 0. 08 (wt.) %Cu, 0. 001 %Cd, 0. 005 %Al, 0. 25 %Bi, 0. 03 %As, 0. 02 %Fe, and 0. 005 %Zn. A second cause of contamination in solders, and solder baths in particular, is their actual use in soldering operations. Each time a workpiece is introduced into the bath, some dissolution of the joint base metal(s), protective or solderable coatings, and fixture metal takes place which adds to contamination levels in the solder. The potential impurities include Cu; Ni; Au or other noble metals used as protective finishes and Al; Fe; and Zn to name a few.
