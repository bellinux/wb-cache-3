40|$|The {{presented}} master {{thesis is}} focused on an integration of plant alkaloids' curriculum into education process at eight-year grammar schools or their equivalent at primary and secondary schools. The aims of the thesis are to provide a basic data about <b>plant</b> <b>alkaloids,</b> to specify an integration of the <b>plant</b> <b>alkaloids</b> into the curricular documents and to select specific and suitable methods for teaching of the alkaloid topic at schools. These teaching methods were practically verified at the Karel Čapek's Grammar School at Dobříš by using author's proposals of the school lesson, the project teaching and laboratory exercises. In the terms of benefits for students, it has been verified that the teaching of <b>plant</b> <b>alkaloids</b> using the teaching project and the laboratory exercises, can be performed more efficiently than those during an "ordinary" school lesson.

40|$|Introduction. Ammodendrine (1), anabasine (2) and coniine (3) {{can cause}} {{congenital}} malformations in livestock. They appear naturally in both enantiomeric forms, {{and can cause}} variable physiological responses. A method to measure the enantiomeric ratio of these natural toxins is needed. Objective. To develop a simple and economical method {{in order to determine}} the enantiomeric ratios of piperidine and pyrrolidine alkaloids in small samples of plant material. Methodology. Mixtures of isolated or purified <b>plant</b> <b>alkaloids</b> were converted to their Fmoc-l-Ala-alkaloid analogues forming diastereomeric mixtures, which were then analysed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with mass spectrometry (MS) and ultraviolet (UV) detection to determine enantiomeric ratios. Results. The diastereomeric analogs for ammodendrine, anabasine and nornicotine could be separated and the enantiomeric ratios determined. The Fmoc-l-Ala-coniine analogue was not resolved under the HPLC conditions studied. The enantiomeric ratios of the selected <b>plant</b> <b>alkaloids</b> were measured and found to differ between both location within a species and location between species. Conclusion. A low-cost HPLC method to analyse the enantiomeric ratio of <b>plant</b> <b>alkaloids</b> containing primary or secondary amine nitrogens via conversion to their respective diastereomeric analogues has been developed...|$|R

50|$|The <b>plant</b> <b>alkaloid</b> ryanodine, {{for which}} this {{receptor}} was named, {{has become an}} invaluable investigative tool.

At low (<10 micromolar, works even at nanomolar) concentrations, ryanodine binding locks the RyRs into a long-lived subconductance (half-open) state and eventually depletes the store, while higher (~100 micromolar) concentrations irreversibly inhibit channel-opening.|$|E

5000|$|The {{cause of}} this {{heightened}} response is unknown, although it {{is thought to be}} related to the presence of the TAS2R38 gene, the ability to taste PROP and PTC, and, at least in part, due to an increased number of fungiform papillae.

5000|$|Many of {{the most}} well-characterized 3FTx {{proteins}} exert their toxic effects through binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), a family of ligand-gated ion channels. 3FTx binding interferes with cholinergic intercellular signaling particularly at neuromuscular junctions and causes paralysis.

Alpha-bungarotoxin, the alpha-neurotoxin from the many-banded krait (Bungarus multicinctus), {{has a long history of}} use in molecular biology research; it was through the study of this toxin that nAChRs were isolated and characterized, which facilitated the study of the subunit composition of tissue-specific nAChRs and the detailed pharmacological understanding of the neuromuscular junction. In general, short-chain 3FTx members of this group bind muscle nAChRs only, and long-chain members bind both muscle and neuronal receptors.

40|$|AbstractA {{large number}} of drug efflux {{transporters}} {{have been identified in}} Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and increased expression of these transporters confers drug resistance in this organism. Here we compared the respiration activities of the wild-type strain and a mutant with nine deleted transporters by phenotype microarray analysis. The mutant was susceptible to 66 structurally unrelated compounds including many antibiotics, dyes, detergents, antihistamine agents, <b>plant</b> <b>alkaloids,</b> antidepressants, antipsychotic drugs, and antiprotozoal drugs. To investigate the effect of each transporter on the susceptibilities to these drugs, we used the single transporter mutants, several multiple deletion mutants, and the transporter overexpressor strains to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin, erythromycin, minocycline, ciprofloxacin, orphenadrine, amitriptyline, thioridazine, and chlorpromazine. The data indicate that the increased susceptibilities of the mutant lacking nine transporter genes are mainly dependent on the absence of the acrAB efflux genes as well as the tolC gene. In addition to the AcrAB-TolC efflux system, the results from the overexpressor strains show that AcrEF confers resistance to these compounds as well as AcrAB of Escherichia coli, MexAB-OprM and MexXY-OprM of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The results highlight the importance of the efflux systems not only for resistance to antibiotics but also for resistance to antihistamine agents, <b>plant</b> <b>alkaloids,</b> antidepressants, antipsychotic drugs, and antiprotozoal drugs...|$|R
40|$|The {{secondary}} metabolites {{of higher}} plants include diverse chemicals, such as alkaloids, isoprenoids and phenolic compounds (phenylpropanoids and flavonoids).
