50|$|The <b>Pandora</b> <b>moth</b> or Pandora pinemoth, Coloradia pandora, is {{an insect}} {{belonging}} to the Coloradia genus of moths. It is native to the western United States. The larvae of the <b>Pandora</b> <b>moth</b> feed on the foliage of several species of pine trees, including the lodgepole, Jeffrey, and ponderosa pines. The larvae populations sometimes reach high enough levels to cause severe defoliation; such outbreaks have occurred in northern Arizona, central Oregon, and southern California. The Paiute people in California's Owens Valley and Mono Lake areas harvest, prepare, and store the larvae (which they call piuga) as a preferred food. This has brought the natives into conflict with the United States Forest Service, which has sought to control moth populations {{through the use of}} insecticides.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Pandora</b> <b>moth</b> {{lives for}} about two years. Around the end of June, the adult moths appear; they lay eggs which hatch in August. Over the winter, the larvae remain on the tree, feeding on its foliage. The {{following}} summer, the insects drop off the trees and pupate, burying themselves in the ground, where they will remain for a year (or, in some areas, 2-4 years), until they emerge as adult moths.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1995 Endemic {{populations of}} <b>pandora</b> <b>moths</b> (Co/oradia <b>pandora</b> Blake), a {{defoliator}} of western pine forests, proliferated to epidemic levels in central Oregon in 1986 and increased dramatically through 1 994. Golden-mantled ground squirrels (Spermophilus lateralis Say) consume adult <b>pandora</b> <b>moths,</b> but reject nutritionally valuable eggs from gravid females. Feeding trials with captive S. lateralis {{were conducted to}} identify the mode of egg protection. Chemical constituents of fertilized eggs were separated through a polarity gradient of solvent extractions. Consumption of the resulting hexane, dichloromethane, and water egg fractions, and the extracted egg tissue residue, was evaluated by randomized 2 -choice feeding tests. Consumption of four physically distinct egg fractions (whole eggs, "whole" egg shells, ground egg shells, and egg contents) also was evaluated. These bioassays indicated that C. pandora eggs are not protected chemically, however, the egg shell does inhibit S. lateralis consumption. Egg protection is one mechanism that enables C. pandora to persist within the forest food web. Spermophilus lateralis, a common and often abundant rodent of central Oregon pine forests, is a natural enemy of C. <b>pandora</b> <b>moths</b> and pupae, but not eggs...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Pandora</b> sphinx <b>moth</b> (Eumorpha pandorus), {{also called}} the pandorus sphinx moth, is a North American moth in the family Sphingidae. It is a large, greenish gray moth with darker patches and pink edges and small pink eyespots. The {{underside}} is usually pale yellow-green or brown. It has a wingspan of 3¼-4½ inches (8.2-11.5 cm), females being slightly larger than males. <b>Pandora</b> sphinx <b>moths</b> fly during dusk. Some places see only one generation a year, while others see two.|$|R
50|$|The Paiutes of California's Owens Valley and Mono Lake harvest, prepare, store, and eat {{the larvae}} of the <b>Pandora</b> <b>moth,</b> which they call piuga. The larvae are {{collected}} at their most mature stage, during their July migration to the forest floor {{at the end of}} their first year of life. They are gathered by hand once or twice a day, and temporarily stored in trenches in the ground. The larvae are then roasted in fire-heated sand for 30 minutes; the sand not only cooks the insects but also serves to remove the fine hairs, the setae, from their bodies.|$|E
50|$|The Kucadikadi's {{homeland}} surrounds Mono Lake {{in eastern}} California, but they traditionally traveled to Walker Lake, Nevada for seasonal subsistence activities. Mono Lake {{is a high}} piedmont area of the Sierra Nevada. The average elevation of the Mono Lake basin is around 6400 ft above sea level. The surrounding mountains range from 9000 to 13000 ft in elevation. Mono Lake is extremely saline and is home to several waterfowl species and the brine fly, or Ephydra hians or Hydropyrus hians, from which the band takes its name. Pinus monophylla or Piñon pine has been an importance source of food, as were jackrabbits, deer, mountain sheep, and the Coloradia <b>pandora</b> <b>moth.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Pandora</b> <b>moth</b> (Coloradia pandora Blake) is a {{phytophagous}} insect, defoliating {{ponderosa pine}} {{trees in the}} western United States. However, long-term studies of this insect {{and its effects on}} the forest ecosystem have not been conducted. Using dendrochronological techniques, I examined past timing and intensity of defoliation through its effects on radial growth of trees in the forests of south central Oregon. <b>Pandora</b> <b>moth</b> leaves a distinctive ring-width "signature" that was easily identifiable in the wood. The growth for {{the first year of the}} signature was half the normal ring-width with narrow latewood. The following two years produced extremely narrow rings, with the entire suppression lasting from 4 to 18 years. Twenty-two individual outbreaks were reconstructed from this 620 year chronology. I found that <b>pandora</b> <b>moth</b> outbreaks were episodic on individual sites, with a return interval of 9 to 156 years. Conversely, on the regional scale of south central Oregon, outbreaks demonstrated a 37 -year periodicity. On average, <b>pandora</b> <b>moth</b> defoliation caused a 29 % mean periodic growth reduction in defoliated ponderosa pine trees. Spread maps of the first year that sites demonstrated suppression were plotted revealing an apparent annual spread of the outbreaks. Examination of a fire history on one <b>pandora</b> <b>moth</b> outbreak site suggested that <b>pandora</b> <b>moth</b> outbreaks delay fire by interrupting the needle fall needed for fire spread. Superposed epoch analysis showed that the year that the outbreak was first recorded was significantly dry and the fourth year prior was significantly wet. Therefore, climate may be a triggering factor in <b>pandora</b> <b>moth</b> outbreaks. The stem analysis demonstrated that the percent volume reduction was greatest at the base of the tree and declined further up the bole. The percent volume reduction in the canopy of the trees was variable with outlying high and low values. The mean volume reduction per outbreak was. 053 m³ per tree. Although this insect is considered a forest pest and causes inconvenience for people living nearby, <b>pandora</b> <b>moth</b> is not as widespread and damaging as some other phytophagous insects. However, its very distinctive ring-width signature and the length of the ponderosa pine record enables reconstruction of very long outbreak histories, which may deepen our understanding of the interaction between defoliating insects and their ecosystem...|$|E

40|$|In montane {{forests of}} the western United States, <b>pandora</b> <b>moth</b> (Coloradia pandora Blake) defoliates local pines, {{primarily}} ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. Ex Laws.) and Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi Grev. & Balf.). This defoliation stresses the tree, leaving a distinct outbreak signature in the tree-rings. The occurrence of <b>pandora</b> <b>moth</b> outbreaks has been recorded in ponderosa pine tree rings in Oregon {{as far back as}} 1500 years, however little is known of the outbreak history {{throughout the rest of the}} <b>pandora</b> <b>moth</b> range. To gain a better understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of <b>pandora</b> <b>moth</b> I have reconstructed outbreaks across the entire range of the insect using 121 tree-ring chronologies from the International Tree-Ring Databank (ITRDB) and 19 chronologies from sites sampled for this study using dendrochronological techniques. I then created a fine resolution habitat model for <b>pandora</b> <b>moth</b> and a gridded tree-ring network of non-host chronologies, which was used to validate statistically confirmed outbreak events across the entire range of the insect. Sites with confirmed outbreaks were then tested against the habitat model for accuracy of model parameters. ArcMap 10 was used to create an animated map of the spatial and temporal distribution of <b>pandora</b> <b>moth</b> across its range. One of my most notable findings is the record of outbreak events further north than previously documented, and the agreement between those northern sites with my habitat model. In my research I have demonstrated the use of dendrochronology to study outbreaks across an insect’s range. The methods I have used here can be applied to other range-wide analyses.

40|$|Dendroecological methods play a {{critical}} role in developing our understanding of forest processes by contributing historical evidence of climate variability and the temporal characteristics of disturbance. We seek to contribute to these methods by developing a research protocol for decoupling radial-growth signatures related to climate, fire, and insect outbreaks in central Oregon. Our methods are based on three independent, crossdated tree-ring data sets: 1) a 545 -year tree-ring climate reconstruction, 2) a 550 -year fire history, and 3) a 250 -year <b>pandora</b> <b>moth</b> outbreak history derived from host (Pinus ponderosa) and non-host (Abies grandis-Abies concolor) tree-ring chronologies. Based on these data, we use visual criteria (marker and signature rings), statistical comparisons, and Superposed Epoch Analysis (SEA) to identify the timing of growth anomalies and establish the temporal relationships between drought, climate variation (ENSO and PDO), fire events, and <b>pandora</b> <b>moth</b> (Coloradia pandora) outbreaks. Our results show <b>pandora</b> <b>moth</b> outbreaks generally coincide with periods of below-average moisture, whereas fire in central Oregon often follows a period of wetter than average conditions. Fire events in central Oregon appear to be related to shifts in hemispheric climate variability but the relationship between fire and <b>pandora</b> <b>moth</b> outbreaks remains unclear...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} one insect, the <b>Pandora</b> <b>moth</b> (Coloradia pandora lindseyi Barnes and Benjamin), and {{its role}} in the native subsistence systems of east-central California. Exploitation of <b>Pandora</b> <b>moth</b> larvae by the Mono Lake and Owens Valley Paiute {{has been the focus of}} varied attention in the literature for over seven decades. By and large, however, these accounts were not based on firsthand observation, and thus there has developed a corpus of misleading, often conflicting, information. The first part of this paper presents a critical evaluation of these discrepancies using both published and unpublished ethnographic, entomological, and archaeological data. Subsequent sections assess the importance of this resource relative to both short- and long-term regional subsistence strategies...|$|E

40|$|Blake, {{periodically}} causes {{severe damage}} to pine {{forests in the}} Western United States. The insect is chiefly found in in-land mountain areas from Montana, to southern New Mexico and Arizona on the east, and from Oregon to southern Cali-fornia on the west (fig. 1). Outbreaks are limited to pine areas having loose soils. The earliest recorded outbreak was on the Klamath Indian Reservation, Oreg., shortly before 1893. Earlier unrecorded outbreaks were indicated by the familiar-ity of Indian tribes in California and Ore-gon with this insect {{as a source of}} food. In parts of the western region, outbreaks have occurred at about 20 -to 30 -year in-tervals and have lasted as long as 6 to 8 years. The <b>pandora,</b> <b>moth</b> caused extensive damage to ponderosa pine (Pinus pon-derosa Laws.) stands in south-central Oregon from 1918 to 1925, and to lodge-pole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl.) in north-central Colorado from 1937 to 1940. In both outbreaks, trees died {{as a direct result of}} defoliation. But in the Oregon outbreak, tree mortality from sub-sequent attacks by bark beetles (Dendroctonus brevicomis Lec. and D. monticolae Hopk.) in defoliated stands caused a greater immediate loss than di-rect damage by the <b>pandora,</b> <b>moth</b> and was estimated at 100 million board feet. Surviving trees showed reduced vigor and temporary loss in radial growth. In 1959 - 66, outbreaks occurred in Ore...|$|E
40|$|The {{harvesting}} of <b>Pandora</b> <b>moth</b> larvae (Coloradia pandora lindseyi Barns and Benjamin), or piagi, by the Owens Valley Paiute {{and other}} native {{peoples of the}} Sierra Nevada of California, has attracted varied attention {{since the turn of}} the century. Early papers by entomologists, including Aldrich (1912, 1921), Eldredge (1923), Englehardt (1924), Patterson (1929), and Essig (1934), described the basic process, but were based more on hearsay than on direct observation. They thus created some fanciful impressions. Later ethnographic descriptions, such as those by Steward (1933) and Davis (1965), helped sort fact from fancy, although not completely, as they too were based on secondhand information rather than direct observation. In June, 1981, we observed elderly Paiute from Bishop, California, harvesting and processing <b>Pandora</b> <b>moth</b> larvae. At that time, cost/benefit checks were made on both collection and processing, to which basic nutritional data were added. That season the larvae were collected by hand rather than by the tree-base trenching method that is well attested in the archaeological and ethnographic records. In June, 1982, we planned some additional experiments with the trenching method of collection, in order to compare the basic efficiency of the two techniques. Although unable to complete the experiments because of a population collapse among the larvae, we were able to extrapolate some data from other sources toward these comparisons. This paper focuses on these results, after first describing and illustrating the basic harvesting techniques...|$|E
40|$|A <b>pandora</b> <b>moth</b> (Coloradia pandora Blake) {{outbreak}} {{began in}} 1991 in a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex. Laws) spacing study area that also included scattered sugar pine (P. lambertiana Dougl). The relation of defoliation to five tree spacings (with and without understory vegetation) was examined, and stand growth reduction due to defoliation was estimated. Defoliation generally increased as spacing varied from 2 to 5. 7 meters and then decreased as spacing increased to 8 meters. Partial defoliation in 1992 reduced stand volume growth, while partial defoliation in 1994 reduced height growth during 1990 - 94. Basal area growth of nonefoliated sugar pine and partially defoliated ponderosa pine trees outside the outbreak area. Ratios of annual basal area increments for nondefoliated trees to annual increments of partially defoliated ponderosa pine sharply increased after the outbreak. Basal area annual increments of sample trees were reduced by 25 prcent {{in the first}} growing season after defoliation (1992), 30 percent the second year after defoliation (1993), and 63 percent after the second defoliation (1994) ...|$|E
40|$|Defoliating {{insects are}} major {{disturbance}} agents affecting forest health and productivity in eastern Oregon and Washington, USA. Information {{on the four}} main defoliators of conifers in eastern Oregon and Washington is abundant. Because of concerns about growth suppression and mortality of trees during widespread defoliator outbreaks, much research effort {{has been focused on}} these species. They are western spruce budworm (Choristoneura occidentalis), Douglas fir tussock moth (Orgyia pseudotsugata), <b>pandora</b> <b>moth</b> (Coloradia pandora), and larch casebearer (Coleophora laricella). Various interactions of defoliators with other system components and natural regulatory processes have been described, as have monitoring and suppression techniques using pheromone traps. Large-scale suppression projects using both chemical and biological materials have been used in attempts to control some defoliator outbreaks. While such suppression projects have prevented some tree mortality and growth loss, they have been largely ineffective in changing the outbreak behaviour of these insects. Some suppression materials have undesirable side effects on non-target insects such as sensitive or endangered moths, butterflies, and skippers, or on other ecological processes. Successful control of larch casebearer has been achieved by introduction of parasitic wasps. For most defoliators, the recommended strategy is preventative: silvicultural treatment to promote a diversity of tree species, stand structures, and moderate stocking levels. Decision-support tools UPEST and UTOOLS analyse insect and disease risks, and the Forest Vegetation Simulator models effects of insects and disease on stand growth.
