5|$|The <b>physiological</b> <b>responses</b> of the {{epaulette}} shark to low oxygen are {{mediated by the}} nucleoside adenosine. In hypoxic conditions, the heart and ventilation rates drop sharply. The shark's blood pressure falls by half as the blood vessels dilate to deliver more blood to the brain and heart. Unlike in bony fishes and tetrapods, the blood flow rate remains constant {{and there is no}} elevation of blood glucose levels. The brains of sharks only consume a third as much ATP as those of teleosts. The {{epaulette shark}} is able to lower this energy demand further by reducing the metabolism of certain areas of its brain, e.g. keeping the sensory nuclei functional while deactivating the motor nuclei. This allows the shark to supply enough ATP to prevent neuron death, while still remaining alert to its environment.|$|E

50|$|A ligand {{that can}} bind to a receptor, alter the {{function}} of the receptor, and trigger a <b>physiological</b> <b>response</b> is called an agonist for that receptor. Agonist binding to a receptor can be characterized both in terms of how much <b>physiological</b> <b>response</b> can be triggered {{and in terms of the}} concentration of the agonist that is required to produce the <b>physiological</b> <b>response.</b> High-affinity ligand binding implies that a relatively low concentration of a ligand is adequate to maximally occupy a ligand-binding site and trigger a <b>physiological</b> <b>response.</b> The lower the Ki concentration is, the more likely there will be a chemical reaction between the pending ion and the receptive antigen. Low-affinity binding (high Ki level) implies that a relatively high concentration of a ligand is required before the binding site is maximally occupied and the maximum <b>physiological</b> <b>response</b> to the ligand is achieved. In the example shown to the right, two different ligands bind to the same receptor binding site. Only one of the agonists shown can maximally stimulate the receptor and, thus, can be defined as a full agonist. An agonist that can only partially activate the <b>physiological</b> <b>response</b> is called a partial agonist. In this example, the concentration at which the full agonist (red curve) can half-maximally activate the receptor is about 5 x 10−9 Molar (nM = nanomolar).Ligands that bind to a receptor but fail to activate the <b>physiological</b> <b>response</b> are receptor antagonists.|$|R

These are all <b>physiological</b> <b>responses</b> to preserve heat. Increased urine production due to cold, mental confusion, and hepatic dysfunction may also be present. Hyperglycemia may be present, as glucose consumption by cells and insulin secretion both decrease, and tissue sensitivity to insulin may be blunted.

Hypoglycemia is also found in many hypothermic patients, because hypothermia may be a result of hypoglycemia.|$|E
25|$|Not to be {{confused}} with an earlier and different invention with the same name, a polygraph, popularly referred to as a lie detector, is an instrument that measures and records several physiological indices such as blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and skin conductivity while the subject is asked and answers a series of questions, in the belief that deceptive answers will produce <b>physiological</b> <b>responses</b> that can be differentiated from those associated with non-deceptive answers. The polygraph was invented in 1921 by John Augustus Larson, a medical student at the University of California at Berkeley and a police officer of the Berkeley Police Department in Berkeley, California. According to Encyclopædia Britannica, the polygraph was on its 2003 list of the 325 greatest inventions.|$|E
25|$|Many {{believe that}} {{physiological}} adaptation to Mars gravity (0.38 G) and re-adaptation to Earth gravity (1 G) would {{be enhanced by}} frequent exposure to artificial gravity on board the spacecraft en route to and from Mars.

This solution, while potentially effective, raises a number of operational, engineering, and physiological issues that {{will need to be}} addressed. The human <b>physiological</b> <b>responses</b> to long-duration exposure to anything other than zero-gravity or Earth's gravity are unknown.

25|$|Live or {{recorded}} music: Live or {{recorded music}} has been effective in promoting respiratory regularity and oxygen saturation levels, as well as decreasing signs of neonatal distress. Since premature infants have sensitive and immature sensory modalities, music is often performed in a gentle and controlled environment, either {{in the form of}} audio recordings or live vocalization, although live singing has been shown to have a greater effect. Live music also reduces the <b>physiological</b> <b>responses</b> in parents. Studies have shown that by combining live music, such as harp music, with the Kangaroo Care, maternal anxiety is reduced. This allows for parents, especially mothers, to spend important time bonding with their premature infants. Female singing voices are also more effective at soothing premature infants. Despite being born premature, infants show a preference for the sound of a female singing voice, making it more beneficial than instrumental music.|$|E
25|$|Dydrogesterone is {{a highly}} {{selective}} progestogen, and due to its unique structure, unlike progesterone and many other progestins, binds almost exclusively to the progesterone receptor (PR). The affinity of dydrogesterone for the PR is relatively low at about 16% of that of progesterone. However, in vivo, dydrogesterone is much more potent in comparison, with an equivalent dose, in terms of endometrial proliferation, that is 10 to 20 times {{lower than that of}} progesterone. This is due to pharmacokinetic differences between the two drugs, namely improved bioavailability and metabolic stability with dydrogesterone as well as additional progestogenic activity of its metabolites. Although dydrogesterone binds to both isoforms of the PR and has similar activity as an agonist of the PRB as progesterone, its agonistic activity is weak {{in the case of the}} PRA. Hence, dydrogesterone shows selectivity for activation of the PRB. This could potentially confer a therapeutic advantage, as the two receptor isoforms induce different <b>physiological</b> <b>responses</b> in target tissues.|$|E
25|$|For the {{mosquito}} {{to obtain a}} blood meal, it must circumvent the vertebrate's <b>physiological</b> <b>responses.</b> The mosquito, as with all blood-feeding arthropods, has mechanisms to effectively block the hemostasis system with their saliva, which contains a mixture of secreted proteins. Mosquito saliva negatively affects vascular constriction, blood clotting, platelet aggregation, angiogenesis and immunity, and creates inflammation. Universally, hematophagous arthropod saliva contains at least one anti-clotting, one anti-platelet, and one vasodilatory substance. Mosquito saliva also contains enzymes that aid in sugar feeding and antimicrobial agents to control bacterial growth in the sugar meal. The composition of mosquito saliva is relatively simple, as it usually contains fewer than 20 dominant proteins. Despite the great strides in knowledge of these molecules and their role in blood feeding achieved recently, scientists still cannot ascribe functions to {{more than half of}} the molecules found in arthropod saliva. One promising application is the development of anti-clotting drugs, such as clotting inhibitors and capillary dilators, that could be useful for cardiovascular disease.|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{atmospheric}} {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) directly affects plant physiology. Using a coupled land-atmosphere model, multiple simulations {{have been conducted}} to {{examine the impact of}} the <b>physiological</b> <b>response</b> of vegetation to varying levels of CO 2 near the leaf surface. Results showed that the impact of increased CO 2 on stomatal conductance generally led to statistically significant changes in latent heat flux (LHF), temperature, and rainfall, at global to regional scales. The CO 2 -induced reduction in stomatal conductance decreased LHF from the surface, resulting in warming over large areas. The coupling of the <b>physiological</b> <b>response</b> to elevated CO 2 and moisture availability was evident in simulations over Australia in summer. The influences of seasonality and moisture availability on the <b>physiological</b> <b>response</b> varied according to vegetation type where the influences are stronger over grass and shrubs than forests. Probability density functions (PDF) of the regional LHF and temperature indicated the non-uniform effects of the <b>physiological</b> <b>response</b> to increased CO 2, with a higher sensitivity at the upper tails of the distribution. The shift of the PDF towards lower values for LHF and towards higher values for temperature suggest that the <b>physiological</b> <b>response</b> increases the probability of higher temperature or sustains the high temperatures for a longer period, when evaporation is unlimited under high net radiation. The anomalous warming over the Murray-Darling Basin in 2002 was also investigated and was found to be unlikely caused by the physiological effect of CO 2. The robustness of the results and their general agreement with the literature indicate that the physiological forcing requires further examination in observations and numerical experiments. The small physiological impact of increased CO 2 from pre-industrial to present day levels suggests that the exclusion of the <b>physiological</b> <b>response</b> likely does not significantly affect historical climate change assessments. However, the increase in magnitude and areal extent of the changes in climate accompanying higher levels of CO 2 underlines the need for the <b>physiological</b> <b>response</b> to be included in future climate projections to avoid underestimating the scale of future regional climate change...|$|R
25|$|There are {{two methods}} of encoding/remembering music. The first process {{is known as}} {{relative}} pitch, which refers to a person's ability to identify the intervals between given tones. Therefore, the song is learned as a continuous succession of intervals. Some people can also use absolute pitch in the process; this is ability to name or replicate a tone without reference to an external standard. Relative pitch has also been credited by some with being the more sophisticated of the two processes as it allows for quick recognition regardless of pitch, timbre or quality, as well as having the ability to produce <b>physiological</b> <b>responses,</b> for example, if the melody violates the learned relative pitch. Relative pitch {{has been shown to}} develop at varying rates dependent on culture. Trehub and Schellenberg (2008) found that 5- and 6-year-old Japanese children performed significantly better at a task requiring the utilization of relative pitch than same-aged Canadian children. They hypothesized that this could be because the Japanese children have more exposure to pitch accent via Japanese language and culture than the predominantly stressed environment Canadian children experience.|$|E
25|$|Psycho-physiological {{measures}} {{also serve}} as process indices of operator SA by providing {{an assessment of the}} relationship between human performance and a corrected change in the operator's physiology (e.g., French, Clark, Pomeroy, Seymour, & Clarke, 2007). In other words, cognitive activity is associated with changes in the operator's physiological states. For example, the operator's overall functional state (as assessed using psycho-physiological measures, such as electroencephalographic (EEG) data, eyeblinks, and cardiac activity) may provide an indication as to whether the operator is sleep fatigued {{at one end of the}} continuum, or mentally overloaded at the other end (Wilson, 2000). Other psycho-physiological measures, such as event related potentials (ERP), event related desynchronization (ERD), transient heart rate (HR), and electrodermal activity (EDA), may be useful for evaluating an operator's perception of critical environmental cues, that is, to determine if the operator has detected and perceived a task-relevant stimulus (Wilson, 2000). In addition, it is also possible to use psycho-physiological measures to monitor operators' environmental expectancies, that is, their <b>physiological</b> <b>responses</b> to upcoming events, as a measure of their current level of SA (Wilson, 2000).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{exploratory}} case study was to describe an expert teacher?s decision-making system during interactive instruction using teacher self-report information, classroom observation data, and physiological recordings.

Bivariate time series analysis of decision-action rates and <b>physiological</b> <b>response</b> rates showed a significant positive relationship between the teacher?s decision-action rate and her <b>physiological</b> <b>response</b> rate on one teaching day. The positive relationship between the teacher?s decision-action rate and her <b>physiological</b> <b>response</b> rate was found to be context-dependent and related to the teaching strategy being used. High decision-action rates during direct instruction were associated with high <b>physiological</b> <b>response</b> rates compared to lower decision-action rates and <b>physiological</b> <b>response</b> rates while monitoring independent seatwork during a test. Correlation analysis of <b>physiological</b> <b>response</b> rates with time revealed slight, but statistically significant negative trends for four of the five observation days. Major features of the teacher?s decision-making system included focusing attention on academic instruction with the use of routines for managing students and materials to perform teaching tasks; both proactive and reactive improvisational decisions; and physiological events characteristic of autonomic nervous system activity during instructional sequences of high teacher-student interactivity.
