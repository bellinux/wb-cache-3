Addition of adjuvants may alleviate or aggravate such effects. Investigating the differences in plant responses to insecticide/adjuvant treatments may help in selecting a proper adjuvant to reduce insecticide phytotoxicity. This study examined the responses of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) leaves to profenofos[O-(4 -bromo- 2 chlorophenyl) -O-ethyl S- phosphorothioatel/adjuvant treatments. The specific objectives were performed in four sets of experiments. The objective of the first set of experiments was {{to determine the effects of}} adjuvants on profenofos-induced visual injury of cotton plants. Profenofos/adjuvant treatments caused negligible injury, while combinations of <b>profenofos</b> with other insecticides in a tank mix solution caused significantly more injury. Addition of petroleum oil (PO) to the mix caused the greatest injury, while addition of Silwet or Plex caused the least injury. Uptake rates of pesticides are often associated with the observed visual injury. The objective of the second set of experiments was to determine the effects of the adjuvants on the uptake rates of <b>profenofos.</b> Uptake rates were determined at 0, 3, 6, and 9 hours after treatment (HAT). Uptake rates were significantly highest for profenofos+PO at 3 and 6 HAT as compared to <b>profenofos</b> alone or with cotton seed oil (CSO). Uptake rates of <b>profenofos</b> with Silwet or Plex, determined in another experiment, were smaller than uptake rates of <b>profenofos</b> with PO or CSO. Uptake rates of <b>profenofos</b> with adjuvants were related to the observed visual injury in the field. Increases in ethylene production are often indicative of phytotoxic effects on the plants.

40|$|Background: Many organophosphorus (OP) {{insecticides}} {{have either}} two O-methyl or two O-ethyl groups {{attached to the}} phosphorus atom. This chemical structure affects their responsiveness to oxime-induced acetylcholinesterase (AChE) reactivation after poisoning. However, several OP insecticides are atypical {{and do not have}} these structures. Aim: We aimed to describe the clinical course and responsiveness to therapy of people poisoned with two S-alkyl OP insecticides-profenofos and prothiofos. Design: We set up a prospective cohort of patients with acute <b>profenofos</b> or prothiofos self-poisoning admitted to acute medical wards in two Sri Lankan district hospitals. Clinical observation was carried out throughout their inpatient stay; blood samples were taken in a subgroup for assay of cholinesterases and insecticide. Results: Ninety-five patients poisoned with <b>profenofos</b> and 12 with prothiofos were recruited over 5 years. Median time to admission was 4 (IQR 3 - 7) h. Eleven patients poisoned with <b>profenofos</b> died (11 / 95; 11. 6 %, 95 % CI 5. 9 - 20); one prothiofos patient died (1 / 12; 8. 3 %, 95 % CI 0. 2 - 38). Thirteen patients poisoned with <b>profenofos</b> required intubation for respiratory failure (13 / 95; 13. 7 %, 95 % CI 7. 5 - 22); two prothiofos-poisoned patients required intubation. Both intubations and death occurred late compared with other OP insecticides. Prolonged ventilation was needed in those who survived-a median of 310 (IQR 154 - 349) h. Unexpectedly, red cell AChE activity on admission did not correlate with clinical severity-all patients had severe AChE inhibition (about 1 % of normal) but most had only mild cholinergic features, were conscious, and did not require ventilatory support. Conclusions: Compared with other commonly used OP insecticides, <b>profenofos</b> and prothiofos are of moderately severe toxicity, causing relatively delayed respiratory failure and death. There was no apparent response to oxime therapy. The lack of correlation between red cell AChE activity and clinical features suggests that this parameter may not always be a useful marker of synaptic AChE activity and severity after OP pesticide poisoning...|$|E

Median lethal concentrations (LC 50 at 24 and 48 h) were respectively estimated as 11. 6 and 9. 8 mu g L- 1 for <b>profenofos,</b> 142. 1 and 102. 7 mu g L- 1 for dimethoate, 0. 7 and 0. 3 mu g L- 1 for chlorpyrifos, and 439. 7 and 329 mu g L- 1 for zinc. Effects of carbendazim could not be estimated because carbendazim exposure needs more than 24 h exposure period to produce observable effects at the concentrations used. The EC 50 using post-exposure feeding rates determined for <b>profenofos,</b> dimethoate, chlorpyrifos and zinc were 6. 023, 269. 3, 0. 293 and 109. 01 mu g L- 1, respectively, at 24 h of exposure. Only chlorpyrifos and zinc had LC 50 concentrations greater than the post-exposure feeding EC 50 concentrations. This study demonstrated that the M. rosenbergii could also be used as a test animal to detect the effects of different chemical contaminants in aquatic environments...|$|E
40|$|House flies (Musca domestica L.) are key pests {{of poultry}} and are managed {{worldwide}} {{with a variety}} of insecticides. However, extensive and injudicious use of insecticides has {{led to the development of}} resistance in many insect pests. Insecticide mixtures can increase the efficacy of the product and/or delay the development of resistance, thus making them a useful tool for pest control. In addition to their efficacy when used alone, mixtures of emamectin benzoate, spinosad or nitenpyram with either lambda-cyhalothrin or <b>profenofos</b> were assessed against a susceptible strain of house flies collected from poultry farms. The analysis revealed that combination indices for lambda-cyhalothrin/emamectin benzoate and lambda-cyhalothrin/spinosad mixtures were significantly > 1, indicating an antagonistic effect. In contrast, the indices for all the tested ratios of lambda-cyhalothrin/nitenpyram were significantly < 1, suggesting a synergistic effect. For mixtures containing <b>profenofos,</b> combination indices varied significantly. For example, synergism was observed in a 1 : 1 mixture containing lambda-cyhalothrin and emamectin benzoate, but antagonism occurred when a higher proportion of the latter insecticide was used. Conversely, synergism in a mixture containing <b>profenofos</b> and nitenpyram was observed only when a lower proportion of the second insecticide was used. The present results suggest that ideal insecticide mixtures must be empirically determined and alternative strategies such as mosaics, rotations and cultural control should be considered for the management of the house fly...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} the phosphorothoate insecticide <b>profenofos</b> on male specific gene expression on rat testis, 16 -week-old Wistar rats were orally administered at dose of 17. 8 mg/kg twice weekly for 65 days. Gene expression in the testes was monitored by DNA microarray analysis and real-time RT-PCR, which revealed that genes related to steroidogenesis including cytochrome P 450 17 A 1 (CYP 17 A 1), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and CYP 11 A 1 were significantly increased. Besides the testes were histopathologicaly examined, which revealed testicular destruction and degeneration represented by a layer of columnar epithelium, oedematous changes surrounding the seminiferous tubules besides vacuolated spermatogonial cells and more elongated Leydig cells. These data suggest that <b>profenofos</b> considered as one of the male reproductive toxicants. Furthermore, we propose that the above three steroidogenic-related genes and the gene of acrosomal reaction as potential biomarkers of testicular toxicity...|$|E
