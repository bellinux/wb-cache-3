5|$|The {{origins of}} the Kangchu system {{dates back to the}} mid-18th century, when early Chinese {{settlers}} in Penang experimented in cash crop <b>plantations</b> with various types of crops, including pepper, gambier, betelnut and clove. The <b>plantations</b> were abandoned by the late 18th-century, as Penang experienced wars from Buginese seafarers that resulted in many gambier <b>plantations</b> being destroyed; contributing to the decline in <b>plantations</b> was the growing popularity of the spice trade that reaped much greater profits. At the beginning of the 19th century, these Chinese settlers began to look south to Malacca and Singapore, where gambier and pepper <b>plantations</b> had also been established.|$|E
5|$|<b>Plantations</b> that {{operated}} {{within the}} present-day boundaries of West Virginia {{were located in}} the counties of the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians and in the Kanawha and Ohio River valley regions. Beginning in the mid-to-late 18th century, members of the Washington family and other prominent Virginia families began to build elegant Georgian mansions on their <b>plantations</b> in the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians region of present-day West Virginia. <b>Plantations</b> initially developed in the counties lying within the Northern Neck Proprietary of Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron within the Shenandoah Valley and South Branch Potomac River valleys. Slavery as practiced through <b>plantations</b> in the American South was carried over from the <b>plantations</b> of the Piedmont and Tidewater regions of Virginia, where <b>plantations</b> had become the foundation of society and industry. Following the French and Indian War, settlement and agricultural development continued unabated in the Shenandoah and South Branch Potomac valleys. Early instances of western Virginia <b>plantations</b> with grand homes include the John Ariss-designed Harewood (1774) for George Washington's brother Samuel Washington and Happy Retreat (1780) built by Washington's younger brother Charles Washington, {{both of which are}} located near Charles Town in present-day Jefferson County. In Hampshire County, Nicholas Casey constructed a Georgian mansion (1774) at his Wappocomo plantation, one of the first plantation houses {{of its kind in the}} South Branch Potomac River valley.|$|E
5|$|This task {{system of}} slavery was common among sea island <b>plantations</b> in the Southeastern United States. In contrast, cotton and tobacco <b>plantations</b> in Virginia {{and other parts}} of the South practiced the gang system, where an {{overseer}} who was also a slave drove slaves to work the entire day.|$|E

5|$|As the gambier {{and pepper}} <b>plantations</b> {{expanded}} in the 1870s, the more established Kangchu were entrusted with larger blocks of farms and made contracts with Chinese merchants from Singapore. The profits generated from harvests of these <b>plantations</b> formed {{the bulk of}} Johor's economy, and financed the development of Johor's infrastructure. Abu Bakar's relationship with the Chinese leaders was excellent, and he appointed many of them to political positions in the state. Of particular note, Abu Bakar appointed two Chinese leaders to the Johor State Council: a Kangchu from Chaozhou, Tan Hiok Nee, and a contractor from Taishan, Wong Ah Fook, who also owned gambier and pepper farms in Mersing in the 1880s. As the land along the river banks in Southern Johor was already taken by the earlier waves of Chinese settlers, newer Chinese settlers began migrating northwards in the 1870s and established new gambier and pepper <b>plantations</b> further north; new <b>plantations</b> were established in Yong Peng, Batu Pahat, Benut, Endau and Kota Tinggi. In particular, Abu Bakar actively encouraged Chinese settlers to establish <b>plantations</b> in Muar, shortly after the British Colonial Government ruled in favour of Abu Bakar over Tengku Alam Shah (Sultan Ali's eldest son) and his family, and granted Abu Bakar control of Muar.|$|E
5|$|British rule in Nyasaland radically {{altered the}} local {{indigenous}} power structures. The early colonial period saw some immigration and settlement by white colonists, who bought large swathes of territory from local chiefs, often for token payments in beads or guns. Most {{of the land}} acquired, particularly in the Shire Highlands, was converted into white-owned <b>plantations</b> where tea, coffee, cotton and tobacco were grown. The enforcement of colonial institutions, such as the Hut Tax, compelled many indigenous people to find paid work {{and the demand for}} labour created by the <b>plantations,</b> led to their becoming a major employer. Once employed on the <b>plantations,</b> black workers found that they were frequently beaten and subject to racial discrimination. Increasingly, the <b>plantations</b> were also forced to rely on a system of forced labour or corvée, known locally at the thangata.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, {{the rise}} of slavery {{was due to the}} {{increasing}} rise of crops being produced and traded, more specifically {{the rise of}} the plantation economy The rise of the <b>plantations</b> was the main reason for the trade of commodities during proto-globalization. <b>Plantations</b> were used by the exporting countries (mainly America) to grow the raw materials needed to manufacture the goods which were traded back into the plantation economy. Commodities that grew in trade due to the plantation economy were mainly tobacco, cotton, sugar cane, and rubber.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days, Chinese Foochow {{settlers}} in Sibu tried {{to convert the}} town into a rice cultivation centre. However, this vision did not materialise because the soil was not suitable for rice cultivation. In August 1909, Charles Brooke agreed to grant land titles to Sibu Chinese farmers and encouraged them to cultivate rubber <b>plantations.</b> The rise of rubber prices from 1909 to 1911 had encouraged another 2,000 Foochow settles to come to Sibu. The demand for rubber rose again during Korean War between 1950 and 1953 and has benefited Sibu rubber <b>plantations.</b> Local farmers later used the profits from rubber <b>plantations</b> into setting up shops at Sungai Merah and Durin bazaars and involve in more profitable timber industry. During the Sarawak Communist Insurgency in the 1970s, rural farmers had to abandon their rubber <b>plantations</b> because of martial law declared by the state government which forbade them for helping the communists operating in the jungles.|$|E
5|$|It became common {{knowledge}} among the settlers that their European vines, of the vinifera. variety, simply would not grow in American soil, and they resorted to growing Native American plants, and established <b>plantations</b> of these native vines.
