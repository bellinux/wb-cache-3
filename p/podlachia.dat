25|$|In {{the early}} 1320s, a Lithuanian army led by Gediminas {{defeated}} a Slavic army led by Stanislav of Kiev at the Battle on the Irpen' River, and conquered the city. The Tatars, who also claimed Kiev, retaliated in 1324–1325, so while Kiev was {{ruled by a}} Lithuanian prince, it had to pay {{a tribute to the}} Golden Horde. Finally, {{as a result of the}} Battle of Blue Waters in 1362, Kiev and surrounding areas were incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by Algirdas, Grand Duke of Lithuania. In 1482, the Crimean Tatars sacked and burned much of Kiev. In 1569 (Union of Lublin), when the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was established, the Lithuanian-controlled lands of the Kiev region, Podolia, Volhynia, and <b>Podlachia,</b> were transferred from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, and Kiev became the capital of Kiev Voivodeship. In 1658 (Treaty of Hadiach), Kiev was supposed to become the capital of the Duchy of Rus' within the Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth, but the treaty was never ratified to this extent. Kept by the Russian troops since 1654 (Treaty of Pereyaslav), it became a part of the Tsardom of Russia from 1667 on (Truce of Andrusovo) and enjoyed a degree of autonomy. None of the Polish-Russian treaties concerning Kiev have ever been ratified. In the Russian Empire Kiev was a primary Christian centre, attracting pilgrims, and the cradle of many of the empire's most important religious figures, but until the 19th century the city's commercial importance remained marginal.|$|E

50|$|In the 19th century, the {{inhabitants}} of <b>Podlachia</b> were {{under the rule of}} the Russian Empire, with southern <b>Podlachia</b> constituting a part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. After 1831, Russian authorities forbade the Greek-Catholic faith in northern <b>Podlachia</b> and it disappeared from the area. In 1875, Russians forbade this rite in the southern portion as well, and all Greek-Catholic inhabitants were forced to accept the Eastern Orthodox faith. However, the resistance of the local people was surprisingly strong and Ruthenian speakers from this area rejected the separation from the pope. In 1874, blessed Wincenty Lewoniuk and 12 companions were killed by Russian soldiers in Pratulin. In reaction to these measures, the Ruthenians of southern <b>Podlachia</b> began to identify themselves with the national movement of the Roman Catholic Poles. To preserve the full communion with the pope, they changed their rite from Eastern to Latin before the compulsory conversion of Greek Catholics into Orthodox. In 1912, Russian authorities issued a tolerance edict that made it possible to change confession from Orthodox to Roman Catholic (but not to Greek-Catholic, which has been completely deleted). A majority of {{the inhabitants}} of southern <b>Podlachia</b> changed their faith from Orthodox to Roman Catholic. At present, very few people in this area speak Ruthenian (Ukrainian) and nearly all consider themselves Poles. Meanwhile, eastern part of northern <b>Podlachia</b> is still populated by Belarusians.|$|E

50|$|Throughout {{its early}} history, <b>Podlachia</b> was {{inhabited}} by various tribes of different ethnic roots. In the 9th and 10th centuries, {{the area was}} likely inhabited by Lechitic tribes in the south, Baltic (Yotvingian) tribes in the north, and Ruthenian tribes in the east. Between the 10th and 14th centuries, the area {{was part of the}} Ruthenian principalities and Polish and Mazovian Piast states. The area became perhaps a part of the Medieval Slavic territory of Cherven Cities. In the 14th century the area was annexed by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, though later on it still briefly fell under Mazovian Piast rule. In 1446, <b>Podlachia</b> became part of the Grand Duchy, but since 1496 southwestern parts of <b>Podlachia</b> (Drohiczyn Land and Mielnik Land) and since 1501 the northern part (Bielsk Land) used Polish law instead of Lithuanian. In 1513 King Sigismund I the Old formed the Podlaskie Voivodeship (adjective of Podlasie). In 1566, the southeastern part of <b>Podlachia</b> became part of the newly formed Brest Litovsk Voivodeship as the Brest Litovsk County. In 1569, after the Union of Lublin, Podlasie was ceded to the Kingdom of Poland. It was the northernmost part of the Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown. The voivodeship was divided in three lands: the Drohiczyn, Mielnik and Bielsk Land. In the 18th and 19th century the private town of Białystok became the main center of the region, thanks to the patronage of the Branicki family and the textile industry development. After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, <b>Podlachia</b> was divided between the Kingdom of Prussia, the Habsburg Monarchy and the Russian Empire. In 1807, the western part of <b>Podlachia</b> became part of the Duchy of Warsaw, a semi-independent Polish entity, while the eastern part including Białystok fell under Russian rule. In the 19th century the region was a stronghold of Polish resistance against Russian rule. The last partisan of the January Uprising Stanisław Brzóska operated here until 1865. He was hanged publicly by the Russians in Sokołów Podlaski in May 1865. Poland regained <b>Podlachia</b> after restoring independence in 1918.|$|E
