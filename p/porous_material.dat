25|$|Lycopene is {{the pigment}} in tomato-containing sauces, turning plastic {{cookware}} orange and is insoluble in water. It can be dissolved only in organic solvents and oils. Because of its non-polarity, lycopene in food preparations will stain any sufficiently <b>porous</b> <b>material,</b> including most plastics. To remove this staining, the plastics can be soaked {{in a solution}} containing {{a small amount of}} household bleach.|$|E

In this paper, lattice Boltzmann method is applied to simulate the gas diffusion in the fractal reconstructed <b>porous</b> building <b>materials.</b> The isotropic <b>porous</b> <b>materials</b> are reconstructed by the random midpoint displacement (RMD) algorithm. In addition, the filtering and linear spatial transforms are introduced to reconstructed anisotropic <b>porous</b> <b>materials</b> which conform to the typical characteristics of <b>porous</b> building <b>materials.</b> The two-point correlation function and fractal dimension of anisotropic porous media present uniform with the anisotropic strength varied from 0 to 0. 6.

In 1942 Gleizes began the series of Supports de Contemplation, large scale, entirely non-representational paintings that are both very complex and very serene. Materials being difficult to obtain during the war, Gleizes painted on burlap, sizing the <b>porous</b> <b>material</b> {{with a mixture of}} glue and paint. He had used burlap in some of his earliest paintings and now found it favorable to his vigorous touch, for it took the most powerful strokes even while preserving the matte surface he so valued.

25|$|One of the {{disadvantages}} of copper is its propensity to stain light-colored building materials, such as marble or limestone. Green staining is particularly visible on light-colored surfaces. Lead-coated copper {{can result in}} a black or gray stain that may blend well with lighter building materials. Staining can be reduced by collecting runoff in gutters and directing it away from the building via downspouts or by designing drip edges to help reduce the amount of copper laden moisture that comes into contact with material below. Coating the adjacent surface of the <b>porous</b> <b>material</b> with a clear silicone sealant also reduces staining. Staining may not develop in areas of rapid run-off due to the short dwell time of water on the copper.|$|E
25|$|Porous paving (or {{pervious}} paving) is {{an alternative}} to conventional impermeable pavement and allows infiltration of runoff water to the soil or to a dedicated water storage reservoir below it In reasonably flat areas such as car parks, driveways and lightly used roads, it decreases the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff and can improve water quality by removing contaminants through filtering, interception and biological treatment. Porous pavements can have several forms and are either monolithic or modular. Monolithic structures consist of a single continuous porous medium such as porous concrete or porous pavement (asphalt) while modular structures include porous pavers individual paving blocks that are constructed {{so that there is}} a gap in between each paver. Commercial products that are available are for example, pavements made from special asphalt or concrete containing minimal materials, concrete grid pavements, and concrete ceramic or plastic modular pavements. Porous pavements are usually laid on a very <b>porous</b> <b>material</b> (sand or gravel), underlain by a layer of geotextile material. Maintenance activities vary {{depending on the type of}} porous pavement. Generally, inspections and removal of sediment and debris should be undertaken. Modulate pavers can also be lifted, backwashed and replaced when blockages occurs. Generally porous pavement is not suited for areas with heavy traffic loads. Particulates in stormwater can clog pores in the material.|$|E
25|$|The liner {{contains}} the combustion process and introduces the various airflows (intermediate, dilution, and cooling, see Air flow paths below) into the combustion zone. The liner must be {{designed and built}} to withstand extended high temperature cycles. For that reason liners tend to be made from superalloys like Hastelloy X. Furthermore, even though high performance alloys are used, the liners must be cooled with air flow. Some combustors also make use of thermal barrier coatings. However, air cooling is still required. In general, {{there are two main}} types of liner cooling; film cooling and transpiration cooling. Film cooling works by injecting (by one of several methods) cool air from outside of the liner to just inside of the liner. This creates a thin film of cool air that protects the liner, reducing the temperature at the liner from around 1800 kelvins (K) to around 830 K, for example. The other type of liner cooling, transpiration cooling, is a more modern approach that uses a <b>porous</b> <b>material</b> for the liner. The porous liner allows a small amount of cooling air to pass through it, providing cooling benefits similar to film cooling. The two primary differences are in the resulting temperature profile of the liner and the amount of cooling air required. Transpiration cooling results in a much more even temperature profile, as the cooling air is uniformly introduced through pores. Film cooling air is generally introduced through slats or louvers, resulting in an uneven profile where it is cooler at the slat and warmer between the slats. More importantly, transpiration cooling uses much less cooling air (on the order of 10% of total airflow, rather than 20-50% for film cooling). Using less air for cooling allows more to be used for combustion, which is more and more important for high performance, high thrust engines.|$|E

40|$|Frequently, {{damages in}} <b>porous</b> <b>materials</b> arise {{as a direct}} or {{indirect}} consequence of moisture concentration and transport. Usually, detection of the existing moisture in <b>porous</b> <b>materials</b> is fundamentally necessary, {{in order to identify}} the actual damage, as well as their deterioration rate. There have been numerous reports about moisture detection in porous media, employing various direct techniques. In this research work, infrared thermography was employed with the intention of assessing moisture concentration in reference <b>porous</b> <b>materials</b> in the laboratory. Untreated and consolidated porous stones were subjected to capillary rise moisture tests, whilst infrared thermography was used for the monitoring of these laboratory tests. The performance of the investigated <b>porous</b> <b>materials,</b> in order to interpret the moisture phenomena studied and the obtained thermographs, was also examined in terms of their microstructure (mercury intrusion porosimetric results) and isothermic behavior (water sorption curves). The results of this work indicate that thermography ought to be considered as a nondestructive assessment tool for the detection of moisture in <b>porous</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R
40|$|Taylor {{tests have}} been {{commonly}} employed to determine dynamic yield stress of solids {{at a high}} strain rate. In this paper, the original Taylor model is extended {{in order to provide}} a theoretical basis for testing ductile <b>porous</b> <b>materials.</b> The key difference between solids and <b>porous</b> <b>materials</b> in this respect is that <b>porous</b> <b>materials</b> are compressible and their density changes with the compressive strain. Calculations have been made for <b>porous</b> <b>materials</b> with a relative density that is a linear function of compressive strain. The final length of the projectile after impact, L 1 /L, is plotted against parameter ? 0 U 2 /Y (see Fig. 9) and this plot is used in a Taylor test to determine the dynamic yield stress. The mean strain rate of the test can be estimated from Eqs. (21) or (22). In a companion paper (Int J Impact Eng), experiments for dynamic yield stress of <b>porous</b> <b>materials</b> will be reported based on the present theoretical analysis...|$|R

2500|$|Research {{is being}} done testing various {{activated}} carbons' ability to store natural gas and hydrogen gas. [...] The <b>porous</b> <b>material</b> acts like a sponge for different types of gases. The gas is attracted to the carbon material via Van der Waals forces.

The results showed the following optimum reaction conditions: The reaction ratio between luteolin and acryloyl chloride was 1 : 2 (0. 10 g/ 0. 20 g), adding 1. 0 g precursor; the feasible elution time was 12 h; when the molar quantity of modified template molecule was 0. 01 mol and ethenyltriethyloxy-silane (VTEO) was 0. 04 mol, the maximum yield reached 91. 6 %. All samples were tested by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, equilibrium adsorption experiments and selective adsorption experiments.
