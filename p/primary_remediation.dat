Some small towns are experiencing {{the costs of}} building very expensive centralized wastewater treatment systems because of this problem, owing to {{the high cost of}} extended collection systems. To reduce residential development which might increase the demand to construct an expensive centralized sewerage system, building moratoriums and limits on the subdivision of property are often imposed. Ensuring existing septic tanks are functioning properly can also be helpful for a limited time, but becomes less effective as a <b>primary</b> <b>remediation</b> strategy as population density increases.|$|E
40|$|This {{case study}} deals with {{long-term}} {{contamination of the}} Leuna aquifer, which {{is intended to be}} restored using sustainable technologies financed by the state. The contamination can only be solved using active rather than passive intervention, because the aquifer has an extraordinarily low natural attenuation capacity for the specific pollutants. Due to the longevity of the contamination source, the groundwater treatment technology that was chosen for the site must operate for a minimum of 20 years but probably much longer. Since the polluter-pay principle cannot be applied, the estimated dynamic <b>primary</b> <b>remediation</b> costs must be accepted as a political or social cost, which must be paid by current and future generations. groundwater contamination; MTBE-remediation technologies; social costs for groundwater rehabilitation measures...|$|E
50|$|Some low {{volatility}} organic contaminants {{have a short}} hydrolysis half life. For contaminants like these, i.e. 1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane and 1,1,1-trichloroethane, hydrolysis can be the <b>primary</b> form of <b>remediation.</b> As the subsurface is heated the hydrolysis half life of the contaminant will decrease as described by the Arrhenius equation. This results in a rapid degradation of the contaminant. The hydrolysis by-product may be remediated by conventional ERH, however {{the majority of the}} mass of the primary contaminant will not be recovered but rather will degrade to a by-product.|$|R
40|$|A primary {{aim of the}} {{development}} of an acid drainage treatment plant at Mt Lyell is the partial to complete rehabilitation of aquatic ecosystems in the lower King River (downstream of the junction with the Queen River) and upper Macquarie Harbour. A number of <b>primary</b> environmental <b>remediation</b> targets have been identified for this system. These include partial or complete recovery of macroinvertebrate and fish communities in the lower King River, partial or complete recovery of native fish recruitment into tributaries of the lower King River, no mortality or inhibition of growth of salmonids in aquacultural operations in northern Macquarie Harbour. A suite of toxicological tests were conducted to assess the relative success of three main treatment options for wastewaters from the proposed treatment plant at achieving the proposed remediation targets. Three 'test waters' were prepared from acid mine drainage (AMD) waters collected from the Mt Lyell lease. They were: pH 3. 6 with sulphidisation (to simulate Cu removal by sulphide generating bacteria), pH 7. 5 and pH 6. 3. The latter two test waters were prepared by neutralisation of AMD with quicklime, followed by separation of supernatant from precipitates. The pH 3. 6 test water was produced by partial neutralisation with limestone slurry, treatment of supernatant with sodium hydrogen sulphide and separation of supernatant...|$|R
40|$|Half of all college {{students}} {{take at least}} one remedial course {{as part of their}} postsecondary experience, despite mixed evidence on the effectiveness of this intervention. Using a regression-discontinuity design with data from a large urban community college system, we extend the research on remediation in three ways. First, we articulate three alternative models of remediation to help guide interpretation of sometimes conflicting results in the literature. Second, in addition to credits and degree completion we examine several under-explored outcomes, including the initial decision to enroll, grades in subsequent college courses, and post-treatment proficiency test scores. Finally, we exploit rich high school background data to examine heterogeneity in the impact of remedial assignment by predicted academic risk. We find that remediation does little to develop students’ skills. But we also find relatively little evidence that it discourages either initial enrollment or persistence, except for a subgroup we identify as potentially mis-assigned to <b>remediation.</b> Instead, the <b>primary</b> effect of <b>remediation</b> appears to be diversionary: students simply take remedial courses instead of college-level courses. These diversionary effects are largest for the lowest-risk students. Implications for remediation policy are discussed...|$|R
40|$|On {{the morning}} of the 25 th of April 1998, an {{accidental}} spill of the waste damp basin of the Aznalcóllar mine (Seville, SW Spain) occurred. The basin, containing mud and acid waters, suffered a rupture spilling 4 hm 3 of acid waters and 2 hm 3 of acid mud directly into the Agrio and Guadiamar rivers. This accidental spill spread to an area of about 49 km 2 and they had very important ecological consequences due to those rivers are the basic water resource of the Doñana National Park aquifer (located 60 km downstream the mine) that was declared as Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 1994. Remediation actions were taken immediately {{in order to protect the}} population health and agriculture and minimize the ecological impact in the Park. Once the <b>primary</b> <b>remediation</b> actions were applied, it was very important to characterize the residual contamination distribution patterns and to obtain environmental hazards maps in which areas with high heavy metals concentration (Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd and As) can be identified. This paper presents the most important results of the geostatistical treatment of this data. The basic objectives of this treatment were to establish the impact analysis of the contaminant (environmental hazards maps) using the direct cosimulation technique and remediation levels that defines if a certain zone can be considered as contaminated or clean and the design of a new sampling schema that would be applied in future sampling campaigns and planning the optimum sampling for the next campaigns...|$|E
40|$|Research {{findings}} indicate that children construct integrated metacognitive theories about cognitive processes. These theories have been hypothesized {{to play a major}} role in learning and development. In the present study, the development of children’s metacognitive theories about the causes, manifestation, and remediation of reading difficulties was investigated. Twenty-one subjects from each of grade 1, 3, 5, and 7 participated in two experimental sessions. Each subject was presented with four short stories (i. e., two stories per session). Each story depicted a child of the same sex and age as the subject who is a poor reader. The intellectual ability (high versus low) of the depicted children was varied systematically across the four stories. Following Each story presentation subjects’ memory for the story propositions was assessed. Next, subjects were asked to determine (1) the cause of the depicted child’s reading difficulty; (2) the manifestation (i. e., specific aspect(s) of the reading process affected) of the reading difficulty; and (3) remediation strategies. The major findings were that, regardless of age, or the ability and effort levels depicted in the stories, subjects (1) primarily attributed the cause of reading difficulties to either insufficient effort or specific cognitive problems (e. g. inadequate attentional processing); (2) considered that reading difficulties may be manifested in either word identification or comprehension problems; and (3) recommended an increase in effort as the <b>primary</b> <b>remediation</b> strategy. The implications of these findings, for both learning to read and for the social consequences of reading difficulties in school, are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Remediation {{has become}} an {{important}} part of American higher education with over one-third of students requiring remedial or developmental courses. At community colleges in particular, over half of entering students are placed into the courses, and in many states, two-year colleges serve as the <b>primary</b> providers of <b>remediation.</b> With the costs of remedial education amounting to over $ 1 billion each year, many policymakers have become critical of the practice. In contrast, others argue that these courses provide important opportunities for underprepared students. Despite the growing debate and the thousands of underprepared students who enter the community college system each year, little research exists on the role or effects of remediation on student outcomes. This paper addresses these critical issues by examining how community colleges attempt to assimilate students in need of remediation and to prepare them for future college-level work and labor market success. Using a unique dataset of students in Ohio’s public higher education system, the papers explores the characteristics and features of remedial education at community colleges, examines participation within the programs, and analyzes the effects of remedial education on collegiate outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Gas Works Park is {{a former}} gas {{production}} site that has been converted to a public park. Some of the contaminants have been remediated, however much of the soil is still contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAHs are toxic pollutants that {{have been shown to}} have numerous negative health effects. The <b>primary</b> form of <b>remediation</b> at Gas Works Park has been capping, which is usually considered a temporary remediation strategy since it does not remove contaminants from the site but simply covers them, and this requires repeated re-capping efforts. Phytoremediation is the use of plants to naturally remove contaminants from soil, sediment, and water. Endophytes can be added to plants to help improve phytoremediation capabilities and decrease phytotoxicity. Endophyte-assisted phytoremediation using willow shrubs is an alternative remediation strategy that could greatly improve soil quality and permanently reduce contaminant levels in the soil. The goal {{of the present study was}} to explore the social acceptability of utilizing phytoremediation strategies at Gas Works Park. Focus groups and surveys were used to explore public perceptions of the park and of using phytoremediation to clean up existing contamination. Focus group conversations revealed an overall positive attitude toward phytoremediation at the park, and participants introduced ideas for improving phytoremediation acceptability and recommended locations for planting. Data from focus group analysis was subsequently used to inform the development of surveys that were administered to a larger segment of the population of park users. Surveys were used to examine the relationship between phytoremediation acceptability and risk, values, and concern. The relationship between demographic variables and social acceptability was also assessed. Focus group and survey findings indicated a high level of social acceptability of phytoremediation at Gas Works Park. Additionally, ecocentrism and concern were shown to be significant predictors of phytoremediation acceptability. Risk and anthropocentrism were not significant predictors of acceptability. Results and implications are discussed, and suggestions are made for future research and potential remediation actions at Gas Works Park...|$|R
40|$|Eutrophication threatens many coastal {{ecosystems}} {{throughout the}} world. Despite wastewater treatment, {{which led to}} dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) reductions in some regions, productivity has not decreased as expected. This is often attributed to internal loading and ef?cient recycling of nitrogen, shifting the focus to dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). However, DON dynamics is still little understood. This study addresses some fundamental questions on DON dynamics in coastal systems. A spatio-temporal analysis of time series of DON measurements in the Dutch section of the North Sea revealed strong spatial gradients with high seasonally varying DON concentrations in the coastal zone, and low erratically changing DON concentrations with weak seasonality in the open sea. This erratic character of offshore DON concentrations suggests a close coupling between influxes and effluxes from the DON pool, attributable to DIN scarcity. A wavelet-coherence analysis also revealed {{a change in the}} seasonality around 1999 - 2000 in an offshore station, that coincided with increased DIN depletion. To examine this hypothesized quick DON utilization, several experiments were performed in a coastal bay dominated by macrophytes. N and C uptake from individual inorganic and organic compounds and from complex DON pools by various biotic compartments (macrophytes, epiphytes, phytoplankton, microphytobenthos, and bacteria) was investigated using dual stable isotope labeling (13 C and 15 N) and biomarker measurements (D-alanine and phospholipid-derived fatty acids: PLFA). The two seagrasses and one macroalga under investigation exhibited DON uptake capabilities. All primary producers took up nitrogen from inorganic and organic substrates within hours, both in the watercolumn and the sediment, supporting our hypothesized quick DON utilization. Microalgae were an important N sink on these short time scales (up to 24 hours). In the sediment ammonium and glycine N uptake rates were highest for all macrophytes. N uptake from individual amino acids decreased with increasing chemical complexity and C/N ratio in all biotic groups. Algae-derived complex DON in the watercolumn was preferred over bacteria-derived DON, illustrating the influence of DON origin and composition on bioavailability. Watercolumn DIC was predominantly used by the seagrasses, whereas the microbial community dominated complex DOC uptake. Carbon and nitrogen retentions in the sediment were related through the substrate C/N ratio, but carbon and nitrogen uptakes were generally not related. PLFA markers specific for particular groups of algae or bacteria showed different C uptake characteristics per group, indicating that they either preferred different substrates or received DIC after remineralization. This research has illustrated utilization of a highly dynamic DON pool by primary producers in a matter of hours. Carbon and nitrogen dynamics are largely uncoupled. This results in different behaviour of carbon relative to nitrogen under conditions of low DIN availability. The reported inconsistency about DON seasonality in literature are likely related to a balance between supply and demand of nitrogen. These findings support the role of DON as nutrient, particularly under low or decreasing DIN concentrations, which has important consequences for limitation of <b>primary</b> productivity and <b>remediation</b> of eutrophication effects...|$|R
