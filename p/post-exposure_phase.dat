40|$|Melioidosis is {{a complex}} {{bacterial}} infection, treatment of which combines the urgency of treating rapidly fatal Gram negative septicaemia {{with the need for}} eradication of long-term persistent disease in pulmonary, soft tissue, skeletal and other organ systems. Incremental improvements in treatment have been made as a result of multicentre collaboration across the main endemic region of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. There is an emerging consensus on the three main patterns of antimicrobial chemotherapy; initial (Phase 1) treatment, subsequent eradication (Phase 2) therapy and most recently <b>post-exposure</b> (<b>Phase</b> 0) prophylaxis. The combination of agents used, duration of therapy and need for adjunct modalities depends on the type, severity and antimicrobial susceptibility of infection. New antibiotic and adjunct therapies are at an investigational stage but on currently available data are unlikely to make a significant impact on this potentially fatal infection...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{review the}} acute and chronic {{pathological}} effects of sulfur mustard on the genitourinary system and male fertility. Materials and Methods::H VHDUFKHG 3 XE 0 HG DQG*RRJOH 6 FKRODU WR¿QG VWXGLHV {{related to the}} sulfur mustard-induced genitourinary effects and male infertility. Informa-tion in the abstracts of non-English related papers {{as well as those}} in the proceedings of congresses on sulfur mustard were reviewed as well. Results: In acute phase after sulfur mustard exposure, evidences are in favor of micro-scopic and macroscopic renal lesions, very low androgen levels, and impaired spermato-genesis. Several years following sulfur mustard exposure, the long-term pathological effects vary from the renal function impairment to the gonadal damage, in particular, the spermatogenesis. Nevertheless, carcinogenic effect of sulfur mustard on the genitouri-nary system as well as the prevalence of male infertility among sulfur mustard-exposed veterans in the chronic <b>post-exposure</b> <b>phase</b> is still unclear. Conclusion: Sulfur mustard causes both acute and chronic injuries to different parts o...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{influence}} of electromagnetic fields {{on the health}} of humans and animals is still an intensively discussed and scientifically investigated issue (Prakt Tierarzt 11 : 15 - 20, 2003; Umwelt Medizin Gesellschaft 17 : 326 - 332, 2004; J Toxicol Environment Health, Part B 12 : 572 – 597, 2009). We are surrounded by numerous electromagnetic fields of variable strength, coming from electronic equipment and its power cords, from high-voltage power lines and from antennas for radio, television and mobile communication. Particularly the latter cause’s controversy, as everyone likes to have good mobile reception at anytime and anywhere, whereas nobody wants to have such a basestation antenna in their proximity. Results: In this experiment, the NIR has resulted in changes in the enzyme activities. Certain enzymes were disabled, others enabled by NIR. Furthermore, individual behavior patterns were observed. While certain cows reacted to NIR, others did not react at all, or even inversely. Conclusion: The present results coincide with the information from the literature, according to which NIR leads to changes in redox proteins, and that there are individuals who are sensitive to radiation and others that are not. However, the latter could not be distinctly attributed – there are cows that react clearly with one enzyme while they do not react with another enzyme at all, or even the inverse. The study approach of testing ten cows each ten times during three phases has proven to be appropriate. Future studies should however set the <b>post-exposure</b> <b>phase</b> later on.

40|$|SUMMARY. This paper reviews {{several issues}} and {{statistical}} approaches for assessing risks from reproductive toxicants {{with emphasis on}} the study designs, data analysis techniques and most appropriate transformations for the response measures. Importance of time as a critical variable in this endeavor is also discussed. Selecting dibromochloropropane(DBCP) as a case study, the evi-dence of the reproductive risk of this toxicant from epidemiological studies are reviewed first. This {{is followed by a}} reanalysis of data from a rabbit inhalation fertility study where sperm concentration from individual rabbits exposed to one of four doses of DBCP vapor from pre-exposure, exposure and <b>post-exposure</b> <b>phases</b> constitute the response measure. The analysis use three transforma-tions, logarithmic, cube root, and a transformation via additivity and variance stabilization and two longitudinal data analyses techniques using random-effects models and generalized estimating equations. Specific benchmark doses are calculated for alteration of spermatogenesis. Results show that the effects of DBCP on the sperm concentration varies within the period of experimentation, suggesting that chronic experiments must be continued until the estimate of the dose parameter stabilizes. 1...|$|R
30|$|OECD TG 305 {{describes}} a procedure for characterizing the bioconcentration potential of substances in fish. The test {{consists of two}} phases: the exposure (uptake) and <b>post-exposure</b> (depuration) <b>phases.</b> During the uptake phase, separate groups of fish of one species are exposed to at least two concentrations of the test substance. They are then transferred to a medium free of the test substance for the depuration phase. The concentration of the test substance in the fish is followed through both phases of the test. Where possible, the BCF is calculated preferably both as {{the ratio of the}} concentration in the fish and in the water at apparent steady state (BCFss) and as the kinetic bioconcentration factor BCFK, which is the ratio of the rate constants of uptake (k 1) and depuration (k 2) assuming first-order kinetics [2]. OECD TG 305 does not define specific analytical techniques to determine analyte concentrations in the water phase. Commonly applied are liquid-liquid extraction [LLE] and solid-phase extraction [SPE].|$|R
40|$|Nanoparticles (NPs) are {{increasingly}} being commercialized for use in biomedicine. NP toxicity following acute or chronic exposure has been described, but mechanistic insight into this process remains incomplete. Recent evidence from in vitro studies suggested a role for NLRP 3 in NP cytotoxicity. In this study, we investigated the effect of systemic administration of composite inorganic NP, consisting of Ag:Cu:B (dose range 1 – 20 [*]mg/kg), on the early acute (4 – 24 [*]h <b>post-exposure)</b> and late <b>phase</b> response (96 [*]h post-exposure) in normal and NLRP 3 -deficient mice. Our findings indicate that systemic exposure (≥ 2 [*]mg/kg) was associated with acute liver injury due to preferential accumulation of NP in this organ and resulted in elevated AST, ALT and LDH levels. Moreover, within 24 [*]h of NP administration, there was a dose-dependent increase in intraperitoneal neutrophil recruitment and upregulation in gene expression of several proinflammatory mediators, including TNF-α, IL- 1 β and S 100 A 9. Histological analysis of liver tissue revealed evidence of dose-dependent hepatocyte necrosis, increase in sinusoidal Kupffer cells, lobular granulomas and foci of abscess formation which were most pronounced at 24 [*]h following NP administration. NP deposition in the liver led to a significant upregulation in gene expression of S 100 A 9, an endogenous danger signal recognition molecule of phagocytes, IL- 1 β and IL- 6. The extent of proinflammatory cytokine activation and hepatotoxicity was significantly attenuated in mice deficient in the NLRP 3 inflammasome, demonstrating the critical role of this innate immune system recognition receptor in the response to NP...|$|R
40|$|Context: Tobacco use {{is one of}} {{the leading}} {{preventable}} causes of death globally. Mass media plays a significant role in initiation as well as in control of tobacco use. Aims: To assess the effect of viewing anti-tobacco audiovisual messages on knowledge and attitudinal change towards tobacco use. Settings and Design: Interventional community-based study. Materials and Methods: A total of 1999 cinema attendees (age 10 years and above), irrespective of their smoking or tobacco using status, were selected from four cinema halls (two urban, one semi-urban, and one rural site). In pre-exposure phase 1000 subjects and in <b>post-exposure</b> <b>phase</b> 999 subjects were interviewed using a pre-tested questionnaire. After collecting baseline information, the other days were chosen for screening the audiovisual spots that were shown twice per show. After the show, subjects were interviewed to assess its effect. Statistical Analysis Used: Proportions of two independent groups were compared and statistically significance using chi-square test was accepted if error was less than 0. 05 %. Results: Overall 784 (39. 2 %) subjects were tobacco users, 52. 6 % were non-tobacco users and 8. 2 % were former tobacco users. Important factors for initiation of tobacco use were peer pressure (62 %), imitating elders (53. 4 %) and imitating celebrity (63. 5 %). Tobacco users were significantly less likely than non-tobacco users to recall watching the spots during movie (72. 1 % vs. 79. 1 %). Anti-tobacco advertisement gave inspiration to 37 % of subjects not to use tobacco. The celebrity in advertisement influenced the people′s attention. There was significant improvement in knowledge and attitudes towards anti-tobacco legal and public health measures in post exposure group. Conclusions: The anti-tobacco advertisements have been found to be effective in enhancing knowledge as well as in transforming to positive attitude of the people about tobacco use...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to clarify the {{relationship}} between the dosage parameters and temperature increase at the target tissues (up to 5 cm below the skin surface), and to explore the possibility of proposing a preliminary model to guide clinicians and researchers in determining treatment dosages based on expected increase in temperatures at the target tissue. Prior to the conduct of the main study several protocol-related issues were investigated. These included the reliability of the measurement procedures, the optimum speed of movement of the transducer, the optimum size of the treatment area, and the maximum output intensity that could be considered safe for treatment applications and investigations. An in-vitro post-mortem pig model was chosen for the experimental design using only adult-sized pigs, weighing between 60 to 80 kilograms. A total of 76 specimens were obtained from the shoulder and thigh sections of 19 pigs. The therapeutic ultrasound machine used throughout the study was the Omnisound 3000 TM (Physio Technology Inc., Topeka, Kansas, USA) Output from the Omnisound 3000 TM was checked and calibrated as necessary prior to each experiment using a power meter (Model UPM-DT- 10, Ohmnic Instruments Co., St. Michaels, Maryland 21663, USA). Calibration was only performed when the checks demonstrated an error in the output intensity of the machine exceeded ± 10 %. The Minolta spot thermometer (HT- 11, Minolta Co. Ltd., Japan) and the Avio thermal video system (TVS) 2000 TM (Nippon Avionics Co. Ltd., Japan) were used to measure the change in tissue temperatures (dependent variable) at the skin surface and subcutaneously (at l, 2, 3, 4 and 5 cm below skin surface) respectively. The prepared specimen was mounted on a fixed table, with the clean cross-section facing the infrared thermographic camera. The camera to specimen distance was standardised at 50 cm for all experiments. Markers corresponding to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 cm on the specimen were plotted on the display unit, and saved to a 3. 5 inch floppy disk. Measurements were recorded at baseline (prior to commencement of the experiment) and subsequently at 1 -minute intervals during 10 minutes of exposure to the ultrasound, and for a further 10 minutes post-exposure, until the end of the experiment at 20 minutes. In general, there were five main parameters for all the studies: the movement speed of the transducer, the size of the treatment, and the frequency, intensity and duration of exposure and post-exposure to ultrasound. These five parameters represented the independent variables for all the studies. The dependent variable throughout was change in tissue temperature (measured in °C) at the skin surface, and at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 cm below the skin surface. Data were analysed using the SPSS for Windows software, Version 10. 0 (SPSS Inc., 444 N Michigan Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA). Analyses of the data, using a repeated measures analysis of variance procedure, were performed on change in temperature, rather than actual temperature measured at selected time points. Only data from the 5 th, 10 th, 15 th, and 20 th minutes were analysed. This corresponded to the middle and end of the ultrasound exposure phase (5 th and 10 th minute) and <b>post-exposure</b> <b>phase</b> (15 th and 20 th minute), as these were considered to be representative of both these phases of data collection. Data for all 20 -minute sampling is provided in the table of means for each experiment. The level of statistical significance was set at 0. 05. Results of the reliability study showed that both the infrared spot thermometer and the video thermography unit were reliable within acceptable limits (as defined in this study). The latter, however, was more reliable than the former. In addition, the reliability was better for the <b>post-exposure</b> <b>phase</b> compared with the exposure phase, and for deeper tissues compared with the superficial and surface tissues. An unplanned analysis of the twenty minutes of data (at one minute intervals) suggested the possibility of reducing the duration factor from 20 to 4 (5 th, 10 th, 15 th and 20 th minute). In this manner, the data analyses for subsequent studies could be simplified considerably without affecting the overall results. Results of the other protocol-related studies showed that: a. There was no difference in change in temperatures between the slow (60 beats/min or 7 cm/s), moderate (120 beats/min or 14 cm/s) and fast (180 beats/min or 21 cm/s) movement speeds of the transducer. However, for practical reasons, the moderate speed was recommended for subsequent studies; b. There was a significant difference in change in temperatures between the small (2 X ERA), medium (3 X ERA) and large (4 X ERA) treatment sizes. The small treatment size provided the most effective and deeper heating, and was the recommended treatment size for subsequent studies; c. For both 1 and 3 MHz, tissue damage did not occur for intensities up to 1. 5 Watts/cm[superscript] 2. However, irreversible thermal injury to the tissues occurred at 2. 0 Watts/cm[superscript] 2 (1 MHz). Therefore, the recommended maximum intensity at which investigations could be carried out without any risks of thermal injury to the tissues was 1. 5 Watt s/cm[superscript] 2 for both 1 and 3 MHz. The results from the main study demonstrated that the increase in temperature due to absorption of the ultrasonic energy at any of the investigated target sites (up to 5 cm below surface) was related to the ultrasound frequency, intensity and duration of exposure. For the frequency factor, the evidence seems to suggest that compared with the 3 MHz ultrasound, the 1 MHz frequency may be more appropriate for clinical applications as it does not overheat surface tissues, and at the same time, is able to increase the temperatures of target tissues up to a depth of 5 cm. For the intensity factor, the results suggest that the therapeutic range of intensities which can be considered neither too low (as to be ineffective) nor too high (as to be damaging) are 0. 5 to 1. 3 Watts/cm 2 and 0. 3 to 0. 5 Watts/cm[superscript] 2 for 1 and 3 MHz respectively The narrow therapeutic range for 3 MHz could render it questionable for clinical applications. In contrast, the larger therapeutic range available for the 1 MHz frequency suggests that it is more suitable for clinical applications and research. For the duration factor, the results demonstrated that the temperatures at all tissue sites increased as the duration of exposure increased. However, for the <b>post-exposure</b> <b>phase,</b> while the superficial tissues decreased with time, the deeper tissues continued to increase in their temperatures, albeit gradually. In summary, the results demonstrated that a higher frequency, a higher intensity, a greater exposure time and a more superficial site all contribute to a greater change in mean temperature. From these results, a preliminary model to guide clinicians and researchers in determining treatment dosages, based on expected increase in tissue temperatures at the target site, was proposed. While the preliminary model provided is only a first step effort, it is hoped that it can be refined further through use by physical therapists and other users of therapeutic ultrasound...|$|E
