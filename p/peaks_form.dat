25|$|Blue Knob and its {{subsidiary}} <b>peaks</b> <b>form</b> a {{grouping of}} mountains that {{stand out as}} a massif {{from the rest of}} the Allegheny Front and form some of the highest elevations in Pennsylvania's Allegheny Mountains. Blue Knob is separate {{from the rest of the}} Allegheny Front escarpment, and the mountain's lower base is made up of siltstone and shale of the Devonian Catskill and Devonian-Mississippian Rockwell formations. The upper slopes and summit are made up of the buff-colored Mississippian Burgoon Formation of sandstone and conglomerate, which is far more resistant to weathering than the underlying shale and siltstone. The rocks near the summit have a bluish-green appearance, giving Blue Knob its name.|$|E
25|$|The {{spectrum}} of the scattered photons is termed the Raman spectrum. It shows {{the intensity of the}} scattered light as a function of its frequency difference Δν to the incident photons. The locations of corresponding Stokes and anti-Stokes <b>peaks</b> <b>form</b> a symmetric pattern around Δν=0. The frequency shifts are symmetric because they correspond to the energy difference between the same upper and lower resonant states. The intensities of the pairs of features will typically differ, though. They depend on the populations of the initial states of the material, which in turn depend on the temperature. In thermodynamic equilibrium, the lower state will be more populated than the upper state. Therefore, the rate of transitions from the more populated lower state to the upper state (Stokes transitions) will be higher than in the opposite direction (anti-Stokes transitions). Correspondingly, Stokes scattering peaks are stronger than anti-Stokes scattering peaks. Their ratio depends on the temperature, and can therefore be exploited to measure it.|$|E

40|$|International audienceTelephone: + 45 4677 4920 ABSTRACT Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) {{data from}} quartz can follow {{different}} mathematical forms {{depending on the}} stimulation mode. These data {{can be described in}} terms of different multi-exponential models and can be numerically fitted using several well-known methods. Here we make a comparative analysis of the performance and stability of two models, the decay and <b>peak</b> <b>form,</b> and we consider different transformation methods for obtaining the <b>peak</b> <b>form.</b> For the numerical computations we use a nonlinear least squares (NLS) method and a method based on a first-kind Fredholm integral equation (FIE). Our analysis uses artificial data with three components (seven parameters including the background), and ten different levels of background, both the signal and the background contain Poisson distributed noise. Parameters derived using both models are acceptable (statistically consistent and on an average within ~ 1 % of the expected value) and no obvious preference is observed for any particular model, although there may be a suggestion that <b>peak</b> <b>form</b> data shows a smaller mean bias. This conclusion seems to be independent of the type of peak transformations investigated here. Furthermore, it is found that transformation of OSL decay data to a <b>peak</b> <b>form</b> gives better results than direct measurement of <b>peak</b> <b>form</b> data by, for example, varying the stimulation light intensity. The comparison of the two numerical methods suggests that the NLS method performs somewhat better than the FIE method; however, the latter has the advantage that it does not require the 2 user's judgement on the number of components in the data. Testing of the NLS procedure on a measured quartz time-resolved OSL signal (TR-OSL) transformed into <b>peak</b> <b>form</b> yielded reliable parameter estimates even when the signal intensity was deliberately reduced by a factor of sixteen...|$|R

The three peaks of Hiruzen, {{along with a few}} smaller <b>peaks,</b> <b>form</b> the Hiruzen volcanic belt, a subset of the Daisen volcanic belt. An eruption of Daisen occurred approximately 350,000 years ago, and created a [...] lake, known as Lake Hiruzenbara, above the Hiruzen Plateau. The lake supported an extensive population of diatoms for nearly 50,000 years, and Diatomaceous soil on the plain reaches [...] deep in some areas. Lake Hiruzenbara was gradually eroded on its eastern perimeter by the Asahi River, and dried up and disappeared over time.|$|E
60|$|Beneath {{the upper}} and central green circle, the wild valleys are quite desolate and untenanted. Here, to the geologist, there were scenes of high interest, showing {{successive}} changes and complicated disturbances. According to my views, St. Helena has existed as an island from a very remote epoch: some obscure proofs, however, of the elevation of the land are still extant. I believe that the central and highest <b>peaks</b> <b>form</b> parts of the rim of a great crater, the southern half {{of which has been}} entirely removed by the waves of the sea: there is, moreover, an external wall of black basaltic rocks, like the coast-mountains of Mauritius, which are older than the central volcanic streams. On the higher parts of the island considerable numbers of a shell, long thought to be a marine species, occur imbedded in the soil. It proves to be a Cochlogena, or land-shell of a very peculiar form; with it I found six other kinds; and in another spot an eighth species. (21/2. It deserves notice that all the many specimens of this shell found by me in one spot differ as a marked variety from another set of specimens procured from a different spot.) It is remarkable that none of them are now found living. Their extinction has probably been caused by the entire destruction of the woods, and the consequent loss of food and shelter, which occurred during {{the early part of the}} last century.|$|E
