5000|$|There was {{a longstanding}} rumour that the ships could not fire a full {{broadside}} without risk of structural damage. This was disproved during the {{action against the}} German battleship , where Rodney was able to fire upwards of 40 broadsides (380 shells) without major structural damage except to deck planking and upper deck fittings, although damage to sickbay fittings, <b>partition</b> <b>bulkheads,</b> toilet bowls and plumbing in the forecastle was extensive. Virtually every light bulb in the forward section was shattered also. [...] Despite the derisive criticism directed at this class of battleship {{by some of the}} media and some sailors upon their debut, naval historian Antony Preston considered that [...] "they were soundly conceived ships reflecting all the hard-won experience of World War One" [...] and that [...] "they proved to be very well-protected and well-designed ships".|$|R

5000|$|<b>Bulkhead</b> <b>partitions</b> are {{considered}} {{to have been a}} feature of Chinese junks, a type of ship. Song Dynasty author Zhu Yu (fl. 12th century) wrote in his book of 1119 that the hulls of Chinese ships had a bulkhead build. The 5th-century book Garden of Strange Things by Liu Jingshu mentioned that a ship could allow water to enter the bottom without sinking. Archaeological evidence of <b>bulkhead</b> <b>partitions</b> has been found on a 24 m (78 ft) long Song Dynasty ship dredged from the waters off the southern coast of China in 1973, the hull of the ship divided into twelve walled compartmental sections built watertight, dated to about 1277.|$|R

Western writers from Marco Polo (1254–1324), to Niccolò Da Conti (1395–1469), to Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790) commented on <b>bulkhead</b> <b>partitions,</b> which they viewed as an original aspect of Chinese shipbuilding, as Western shipbuilding did not incorporate this hull arrangement until the early 19th century.|$|R

An account of the early fifteenth century describes Indian ships as being built in compartments so that even if one part was damaged, the rest remained intact — a forerunner of the modern day watertight compartments using bulkheads.|$|R
6000|$|Upon this point, and as {{to whether}} or not the {{collision}} was designed, he was, however, not left a moment in doubt, for even as the Belle Helen righted to her true keel, there was the sound of many footsteps running across the deck and down into the great cabin. Then proceeded a prodigious uproar of voices, together with the struggling of men's bodies being tossed about, striking violently against the <b>partitions</b> and <b>bulkheads.</b> At the same instant arose a screaming of women's voices, and one voice, that of Sir John Malyoe, crying out as in the greatest extremity: [...] "You villains! You damned villains!" [...] and with that the sudden detonation of a pistol fired into the close space of the great cabin.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Bulkhead</b> <b>partitions</b> became {{widespread}} in Western shipbuilding {{during the early}} 19th century. Benjamin Franklin wrote in a 1787 letter that [...] "as these vessels {{are not to be}} laden with goods, their holds may without inconvenience be divided into separate apartments, after the Chinese manner, and each of these apartments caulked tight so as to keep out water." [...] A 19th century book on shipbuilding attributes the introduction of watertight bulkheads to Charles Wye Williams, known for his steamships.|$|R
60|$|For {{five minutes}} the LADY ALICE had been {{settling}} rapidly by the bow. Already her stern loomed {{high in the}} air, and foothold on the deck was of the most precarious nature. She carried four boats, and these were all filled and lowered away in safety. As they pulled rapidly from the stricken little vessel Jane Porter turned to have {{one last look at}} her. Just then there came a loud crash and an ominous rumbling and pounding from the heart of the ship--her machinery had broken loose, and was dashing its way toward the bow, tearing out <b>partitions</b> and <b>bulkheads</b> as it went--the stern rose rapidly high above them; for a moment she seemed to pause there--a vertical shaft protruding from the bosom of the ocean, and then swiftly she dove headforemost beneath the waves.|$|R

40|$|Physical and physical-and-chemical {{preconditions}} {{for creation}} of the production technology of chemically bonded building materials and products based on phosphogypsum are presented. The methodology and production technology of chemically bonded lime-and-sandy phosphogypsum material (LSPM) {{with the use of}} modern computerized differential scanning calorimetry are developed and offered. The structure of LSPM is examined. The conceptions of making building composites on the basis of dispersed materials are proved and updated. It was found out that at the definite thickness of water film on the surface of disperse materials, in the thermodynamically unstable state, in the presence of external fields, heightened temperatures and definite pH, cheap water-resistant chemically bonded building composites on the basis of dispersed materials can be made. The results of the LSPM studies showed that such material is effective for forming of low- and middle-quality wall small-piece blocks, <b>partition</b> slabs and <b>bulkheads...</b>|$|R
