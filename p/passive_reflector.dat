Prior to designing the radio system, measurements of signal attenuation on 812 and 466 mHz {{were made in the}} slope tunnel and in the straight and level crosscuts in the mine. Two distributed antenna systems fed by two sets of base stations provide approximately 75 % coverage of the mine. <b>Passive</b> <b>reflectors</b> are used for extending signals into intersecting crosscuts and two-way signal boosters will be used to extend signals to the perimeter and obstructed areas of the mine.

A 600 ohm transmission cable was suspended from the top platform to the ground {{on either side of}} the platform (only on the inside of the end towers). Between these vertical feed cables were the antennas proper, eight half-wave dipoles strung between the vertical cables and spaced ½ of a wavelength apart. They were fed from alternating sides so the entire array of cables was in-phase, given their ½ wavelength spacing.

40|$|Our {{research}} in exploiting the inherent ranging capabilities of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has demonstrated range observations {{at the one}} centimeter accuracy level for <b>passive</b> radar <b>reflectors,</b> given that the radar observations are processed by a geometrically accurate SAR processor. Moreover, external disturbances caused by atmospheric path delay (troposphere, ionosphere) and geodynamic displacements (solid earth tides, ocean loading, [...] .) {{have to be taken}} into account. The correction approach follows the concept used in well established geodetic techniques like Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) or radar altimetry. By making use of these geodetic SAR observations, direct 3 D positioning of specifically designed <b>passive</b> objects (corner <b>reflectors,</b> octahedrons) or active transponders becomes attainable. For TerraSAR-X, the 3 D positioning capability has been tested with different <b>passive</b> <b>reflectors</b> and enables an accuracy at the centimeter level. Regarding Sentinel- 1, the ranging results reported for the geometrical calibration campaign show encouraging results of approximately 6 cm, and further refinements are currently under investigation. In addition, the feasibility of active transponders as radar targets was successfully demonstrated, making Sentinel- 1 another candidate for geodetic SAR applications. The presentation discusses the 3 D SAR method in the context of applications, which require an accurate monitoring of the ellipsoidal heights in order to link them to the global geometric reference frame. We give an overview on our SAR methods and state the potential for positioning and height monitoring with TerraSAR-X and Sentinel- 1 on the base of selected study regions...|$|R

5000|$|Early radar antennas {{generally}} {{consisted of}} a number of small dipole antennas in front of a <b>passive</b> <b>reflector.</b> The dipoles were placed in order to have them constructively interfere in front of the antenna, thereby [...] "aiming" [...] the signal in that direction. The beam's angular spread {{is a function of the}} number of elements, with more elements producing a more tightly focussed beam. A huge number of such elements would be ideal, but impractical due to them having to be placed at a specific distance to each other depending on the wavelength of the radio source being used. In early [...] "longwave" [...] systems, like those used by the British and US, this forced the elements to be placed several feet apart, limiting the number of dipoles to perhaps a dozen for any reasonably sized antenna.|$|E
50|$|Passive {{repeaters}} {{may be used}} {{to achieve}} NLOS links by deliberately installing a precisely designed reflector at a critical position to provide a path around the obstruction. However they are unacceptable in most urban environments due to the bulky reflector requiring critical positioning at perhaps an inaccessible location or at one not acceptable to the planning authorities or the owner of the building. <b>Passive</b> <b>reflector</b> NLOS links also incur substantial loss due to the received signal being a 'double inverse-square law' function of the transmit signal, one for each hop from the transmit antenna to the receive antenna. However, they have been successfully used in rural mountainous areas to extend the range of LOS microwave links around mountains, thus creating NLOS links. In such cases the installation of the more usual active repeater was usually not possible due to problems in obtaining a suitable power supply.|$|E

30|$|The {{power of}} echogenic microbubbles and {{acoustic}} impedance {{depends on the}} size of the microbubbles. The microbubbles, unlike the tissues and the free gas, are not simply <b>passive</b> <b>reflectors,</b> but expand and compress in response to the stages of compression and rarefaction of the acoustic wave, with increasingly large hikes in diameter. The non-linear oscillation of microbubbles determines the emission of frequencies of said second harmonic with a frequency which is twice the insonation. Through the use of specific software, low acoustic pressures and an algorithm of specific processing, it is possible to selectively display the signals from the CM, separating the signal of the microbubbles from the one regarding the tissue. This particular signal is identified in real time by means of two main algorithms: Pulse Inversion (PI) and Contrast Pulse Sequence (CPS) [7, 8].|$|R
