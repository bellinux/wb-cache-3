50|$|An {{increasing}} mechanical {{advancement of}} the timing takes place with increasing engine speed. This is possible by using the law of inertia. Weights and springs inside the distributor rotate and affect the timing advance according to engine speed by altering the angular position of the <b>timing</b> <b>sensor</b> shaft {{with respect to the}} actual engine position. This type of timing advance is also referred to as centrifugal timing advance. The amount of mechanical advance is dependent solely on the speed at which the distributor is rotating. In a 2-stroke engine, this is the same as engine RPM. In a 4-stroke engine, this is half the engine RPM. The relationship between advance in degrees and distributor RPM can be drawn as a simple 2-dimensional graph.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{details the}} {{development}} of a prototype in-flight foreign object damage (FOD) detection system through various stages, resulting in a system capable of detecting objects as small as one gram (1 g) mass. The system comprises an eddy current <b>sensor</b> based tip <b>timing</b> system and acoustic emissions vibration sensors controlled through a digital signal processor (DSP). QinetiQ have developed light weight, contaminationimmune eddy current tip <b>timing</b> <b>sensors</b> for use in engine health management. Engine tests confirmed these sensors' potential for detecting FOD events. FOD detection algorithms were developed and implemented in a prototype DSP that was built and tested on an uninstalled gas turbine engine. The trials showed that the prototype DSP FOD detection system could detect dynamic FOD events at full engine speed. Further work was carried out to enhance the FOD detection system, overcoming limitations in the previous system through the implementation of enhanced algorithms and its extension to accept four eddy current sensor inputs as well as a vibration signal input from an acoustic emissions (AE) sensor. An algorithm that computes engine speed from the tip timing data was also implemented to alleviate the need for a separate 1 /rev signal. A number of engine trials were successfully completed in order to validate the system. The speed algorithm has been successfully validated on engine trials and comparisons with a conventional optical based 1 /rev showed the DSP-generated 1 /rev signals to be almost identical to the conventional system. Typically, the error was in the region of 0. 03 % speed. The investigations culminated in a test series designed to ascertain the system's sensitivity to foreign object impacts. These demonstrated that the system was capable of detecting objects down to one gram (1 g) mass introduced at low speed into the engine intake. Copyright © 2010 by ASME...|$|R

Introduced in competitive skiing, the GPS technique provides all the qualitative data for a complete analysis of position/velocity/acceleration so that the measured trajectories can be compared throughout the entire track. Consequently, it can help the athletes to find the fastest line and to identify any technical errors. This ensures an enhancement of {{the efficiency of the}} trainings to optimize the performances of the skier, {{as well as that of}} the equipment. This kind of analysis requires decimetric positioning of the skier at a 5 Hz pace or higher. This paper presents a technique that combines modern lightweight GPS-RTK dual frequency receivers with standard GSM mobile phones and trajectory filtering/smoothing procedures. This approach was successfully applied in February 2004 during the FIS-World Cup race in Leysin, Switzerland and in April 2004 during the season’s final race of the professional circuit held in Verbier, Switzerland. Racers and their coaches request the assistance of such a system in future contests. Offering instantaneous position and velocity measurements of high accuracy, satellite techniques such as carrier phase-based positioning can be used to optimize the placement of the timing zone around the point of highest speed (Figure 1). This technique is also suitable for the authentication of the 100 mlong separation between the two sensor stations as well as for periodical checks of the 100 m to ensure that the calculations remain valid.

As with the drum printer, as the correct character passed by each column, a hammer {{was fired from}} behind the paper. Compared to drum printers, chain printers had the advantage that the type chain could usually be changed by the operator. A further advantage was that vertical registration of characters in a line was much improved over drum printers, which needed extremely precise hammer timing to achieve a reasonably straight line of print. By selecting chains that had a smaller character set (for example, just numbers and a few punctuation marks), the printer could print much faster than if the chain contained the entire upper- and lower-case alphabet, numbers, and all special symbols. This was because, with many more instances of the numbers appearing in the chain, the time spent waiting for the correct character to [...] "pass by" [...] was greatly reduced. Common letters and symbols would appear more often on the chain, according to the frequency analysis of the likely input. It was also possible to play primitive tunes on these <b>printers</b> by <b>timing</b> the nonsense of the printout to the sequence on the chain, a rather primitive piano.

30|$|The {{significance}} of large-scale WSNs has been emphasized by the emerging internet of things. Usually, the great numbers of sensor nodes are battery-powered {{due to the}} considerations of low-cost and ease of deployment. In the super large-scale networks, unfortunately, energy management issues may tend to beyond control in practice. For a sensor network containing {{tens of thousands of}} distributed nodes, the network lifetime may even be shortened to several hours because of the tremendous and frequent information exchange among sensors, which quickly consumes most of battery energy. As another potential application, the presented USCS can be properly applied to provide a feasible remote powering scheme for the distributed large-scale sensor nodes. As indicated, the single-frequency component can be conveniently recovered by a PLL. Other than providing precise <b>timing</b> for <b>sensor</b> nodes, the receiver can also reserve this carrier energy for subsequent operations by resorting to wireless charging technique. Hence, in large-scale WSNs, the lifetime of low-cost and battery-powered sensors can be significantly prolonged.

40|$|Abstract—Debugging {{electrical}} timing bugs consumes {{a significant}} portion of validation efforts. The main cause of this problem is that electrical bugs appear as one-cycle bit-flips under only a certain operating condition such as voltage, temperature and frequency. In addition, run-time detection of a suspicious electrical bug is drawing attention for enabling voltage over-scaling and/or ensuring reliable operations. In this work, we focus on power supply noise as a primary cause of electrical bugs and propose a supply voltage sensor which achieves one-shot and every-cycle sensing. The proposed sensor can provide cycle-accurate voltage variation for detecting and debugging electrical bugs. The performance of the sensor is evaluated on an FPGA, and the measured voltage resolution is 29 mV. An observed correlation between sensing results and a processor failure suggests the utility of the proposed sensor for debugging.
