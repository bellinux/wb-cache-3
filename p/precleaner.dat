Especially important is to take into account manufacturing including generation of combustible and explosive dust. One of the way to prevent possibilities of fire and explosion is using reverse flow cyclone as a pre-cleaning system.

The purpose of the experiment was to maximize appearance while minimizing metals loading. A five factor (<b>precleaner</b> time, temperature, concentration and brightener time and concentration), two level, resolution five, fractional factorial design was utilized. Synergistic factor interactions were discovered demonstrated the best poss-ible appearance could be achieved while creating a very low metals loading.

The increase of cross section area at the chamber reduces {{the speed of the}} dust-filled airstream and heavier particles settle out.Settling chambers are simple in design and can be manufactured from almost any material. However, they are seldom used as primary dust collectors because of their large space requirements and low efficiency.

40|$|Although dust-holding {{capacity}} {{is the primary}} feature of engine air filters operating in dusty environments, efficiency becomes a major factor when selecting an engine air filter. Inertial separators and high porosity or fibrous prefilters are commonly used to decrease the dust load to the main filter while high efficiency is achieved by utilizing submicron or nanofiber fibers in the main filter. The patented multi-stage filter was designed to achieve ultra-high particle removal efficiency and dust holding capacity, and long life in dusty and on highway environments. The main (final) filter is located downstream of the prefilter. The main filter is made of pleated filter media containing nanofibers with a diameter {{in the range of}} 40 – 800 nanometers. The upstream in-line <b>precleaner</b> utilizing flow-through mini cyclones has separation efficiency of 95 %. A high dust capacity, high efficiency prefilter can be used instead of the <b>precleaner.</b> The prefilter is made of vertically lapped nonwoven filter media made from synthetic fibers of different materials to fully utilize the tribological effect. The volume of the prefilter is determined by the performance required and space allotted. This paper discusses the filter performance of high dust holding capacity engine air filters. Filter specifications, design and performance are discussed in detail. Performance characteristics of the media and full size filters were determined using on-line particle counters and the gravimetric test method. Initial and final efficiency, and dus...|$|E
40|$|Importance of {{the current}} work is {{explained}} by the problem of air purification {{in the field of}} breath of the worker and prevention of the fire and the explosion. To solve this problem the authors offer to use Reverse-flow cyclone as <b>precleaner</b> with spark extinguishing option. In case if the dust includes sparks {{it is very important to}} insure that the particles with the sparks will be totally collected in the cyclone, so the collection efficiency for such particles will be 100 % in the cyclone. For the estimation of the efficiency of gas purification from the dust particles in the cyclones dust particles features should be determinate, that can be done with the satisfactory accuracy only by physical modeling results. The amount of physical experiments was made by the authors. The methods of determination of the geometric diameter and hydraulic size of the particle consisting sparks were offered. The experimental researches showed that the accuracy of using the geometric diameter of such particle is not enough, because the hydrodynamic characteristics of the particles (such as weight, effective diameter, the way of interaction with the environment) can be change in the case of moving. At the same time< hydraulic size, determined in the second part of the experiment, consider all these factors and can be used for the estimation of the cyclone efficiency based on the model of turbulent diffusion with the limited velocity...|$|E
40|$|The initial {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to better understand the reasons for the substantial increase in filter DP that was observed after the gasifier recycle loop modifications. Beyond this specific objective, a secondary goal was to develop a meaningful method of evaluating the effect of particle size and other particle properties on dustcake drag and filter DP. As mentioned earlier, the effect of particle size on dustcake drag and filter DP can be a very important consideration in the selection and specification of a <b>precleaner</b> cyclone for use upstream of the hot-gas filter. Installing a cyclone ahead of a hot-gas filter will reduce the transient areal loading of dust to the filter, but the beneficial effect of the reduced areal loading may be offset by an increase in drag associated with a finer particle-size distribution. The overall goal {{of this study was to}} better understand these tradeoffs and to ultimately develop a procedure that would be useful in analyzing the performance of hot-gas filters and in sizing new hot-gas filters. In addition to the obvious effects of a cyclone on dust loading and particle size, other indirect effects on particulate properties and flow resistance may occur when the cyclone is incorporated into the gasifier recycle loop as was the case at the PSDF. To better understand the importance of these other effects, this study sought to separate the particle-size effect from these other effects by measuring the drag of size-fractionated char samples collected before and after the recycle loop modifications...|$|E
40|$|Radiochemical {{diagnostic}} {{techniques such}} as gas-phase capsule debris analysis {{may prove to be}} successful methods for establishing {{the success or failure of}} ignition experiments at the National Ignition Facility (NIF). Samples in the gas phase offer the most direct method of collection by simply pumping out the large target chamber following a NIF shot. The target capsules will be prepared with dopants which will produce radioactive noble gas isotopes upon activation with neutrons. We have designed and constructed the Radchem Apparatus for Gas Sampling (RAGS) in order to collect post-shot gaseous samples for NIF capsule diagnostics. The design of RAGS incorporates multiple stages intended to purify, transfer, and count the radioactive decays from gaseous products synthesized in NIF experiments. At the moment the dopant of choice is {sup 124 }Xe, which will undergo (n,{gamma}) and (n, 2 n) reactions to produce {sup 125 }Xe and {sup 123 }Xe. The half-lives of each are on the order of multiple hours and are suitable for long-term gamma-counting. These isotopes and the rest of the gases evolved in a NIF shot will be drawn through the NIF turbo pumps, past the temporarily shuttered cryo pumps (to aid our collection efficiency), and towards the first main portion of the RAGS system: the pre-cleaner. The pre-cleaner will consist of a water removal system, a series of heated getter cartridges to remove most other impurities such as N{sub 2 }, O{sub 2 }, CO{sub 2 }, etc., and a residual gas analyzer (RGA) to monitor vacuum quality. The noble gases will flow through the <b>precleaner</b> and into the second stage of the system: the cryo collector. This cryo collector consists of a main cryo head for noble gas collection which will operate for approximately five minutes post-shot. Afterwards a valve will close and isolate the pre-cleaner, while the cryo head warms to release the Xe gas to one of two locations - either a second cryo station for in-situ gamma counting, or to a small cooled gas bottle for removal and counting. Additional capabilities of the RAGS system include a noble gas calibration apparatus attached to the NIF target chamber, which will be operated hours pre-shot to determine collection efficiency through the whole RAGS system via the signal detected from the RGA. Also it is possible there will be the addition of a helium puff system to drive the Xe through the pre-cleaner and collection stations. It is also likely that multiple cryo collection stations will be built into the system in the future to fractionate and collect other noble gases such as Kr, Ar, and possibly Ne. A prototype pre-cleaner has been built at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and is in the testing phases. The information learned in this testing will help collaborators at Sandia National Laboratory that are building and delivering the systems that will be deployed at NIF. The LBNL testing so far has demonstrated that radioactive fission gases can be flowed through the system with and without carrier gases of air and/or He, and the activity can be collected on an activated charcoal sample. Further testing in the upcoming months will hopefully yield more information about any presence of Xe in the water removed from the system, and commissioning of a small cryo cooler as well...|$|E
