5|$|A Momentary Lapse of Reason is {{the thirteenth}} studio album by English {{progressive}} rock band <b>Pink</b> <b>Floyd,</b> {{released in the}} UK and US on 7 September 1987, on the labels EMI and Columbia. It followed guitarist David Gilmour's decision to include material recorded for his third solo album on a new <b>Pink</b> <b>Floyd</b> album with drummer Nick Mason and keyboardist Richard Wright. Although for legal reasons Wright could not be re-admitted to the band, Wright and Mason helped Gilmour craft what became the first <b>Pink</b> <b>Floyd</b> album since the December 1985 departure of bass guitarist, singer, and primary songwriter Roger Waters.|$|E
5|$|When Metcalfe and Noble left to {{form their}} own group in September 1963, the {{remaining}} members asked Barrett and guitarist Bob Klose to join. Waters switched to the bass and by January 1964, the group {{became known as the}} Abdabs, or the Screaming Abdabs. During late 1964, the band used the names Leonard's Lodgers, Spectrum Five, and eventually, the Tea Set. Sometime during late 1965, the Tea Set began calling itself the <b>Pink</b> <b>Floyd</b> Sound, later the <b>Pink</b> <b>Floyd</b> Blues Band and by early 1966, <b>Pink</b> <b>Floyd.</b>|$|E

5|$|By 1994, he had {{rejoined the}} group {{full-time}} {{as an equal}} partner with Gilmour and Mason. He co-wrote five songs and sang lead vocals on one song ("Wearing the Inside Out") for the next <b>Pink</b> <b>Floyd</b> album, The Division Bell. This {{was followed by the}} double live album and video release Pulse in 1995. Wright, like Mason, performed on every <b>Pink</b> <b>Floyd</b> tour.|$|E
5|$|Following {{creative}} tensions, Wright left <b>Pink</b> <b>Floyd</b> in 1979, {{followed by}} Waters in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd; Wright rejoined {{them as a}} session musician and, later, a band member. The three produced two more albums—A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994)—and toured through 1994. After nearly two decades of acrimony, Gilmour, Wright, and Mason reunited with Waters in 2005 to perform as <b>Pink</b> <b>Floyd</b> in London {{as part of the}} global awareness event Live 8; Gilmour and Waters later stated they had no plans to reunite as a band again. Barrett died in 2006, and Wright in 2008. The final <b>Pink</b> <b>Floyd</b> studio album, The Endless River (2014), was recorded without Waters and based almost entirely on unreleased material.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, to {{mark the}} 40th anniversary of the album's release, Thorgerson sold {{a limited number of}} autographed {{lithographs}} of the front cover. Although the 2011 re-release campaign Why <b>Pink</b> <b>Floyd...?</b> presented all fourteen albums newly remastered in 2011, only the studio disc of Ummagumma was remastered – the live disc is the previous 1994 version. Both the live and studio album were re-issued in 2016 with <b>Pink</b> <b>Floyd</b> Records label.|$|E
5|$|Many {{stories of}} Barrett's erratic {{behaviour}} off stage {{as well as}} on are also well-documented. In Saucerful of Secrets: The <b>Pink</b> <b>Floyd</b> Odyssey, author Nicholas Schaffner interviewed people who knew Barrett before and during his <b>Pink</b> <b>Floyd</b> days. These included friends Peter and Susan Wynne-Wilson, artist Duggie Fields (with whom Barrett shared a flat during the late 1960s), June Bolan and Storm Thorgerson, among others.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pink</b> <b>Floyd</b> toured {{extensively}} across America and Europe in 1970. In 1971, <b>Pink</b> <b>Floyd</b> took {{second place}} in a reader's poll, in Melody Maker, {{and for the first}} time were making a profit. Mason and Wright became fathers and bought homes in London while Gilmour, still single, moved to a 19th-century farm in Essex. Waters installed a home recording studio at his house in Islington in a converted toolshed at the back of his garden.|$|E

5|$|Waters {{attempted}} {{to subvert the}} Momentary Lapse of Reason tour by contacting promoters in the US and threatening to sue them if they used the <b>Pink</b> <b>Floyd</b> name. Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs with Mason using his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral. Early rehearsals for the upcoming tour were chaotic, with Mason and Wright entirely out of practice. Realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Bob Ezrin to assist them. As <b>Pink</b> <b>Floyd</b> toured throughout North America, Waters' Radio K.A.O.S. tour was on occasion, close by, though in much smaller venues than those hosting his former band's performances. Waters issued a writ for copyright fees for the band's use of the flying pig. <b>Pink</b> <b>Floyd</b> responded by attaching a large set of male genitalia to its underside to distinguish it from Waters' design. The parties reached a legal agreement on 23 December; Mason and Gilmour retained {{the right to use}} the <b>Pink</b> <b>Floyd</b> name in perpetuity and Waters received exclusive rights to, among other things, The Wall.|$|E
5|$|As the new line-up (with Wright) toured {{throughout}} North America, Waters' Radio K.A.O.S. tour was, on occasion, close by. The bassist had forbidden any {{members of}} <b>Pink</b> <b>Floyd</b> from attending his concerts, which were generally in smaller venues than those housing his former band's performances. Waters also issued a writ for copyright {{fees for the}} band's use of the flying pig, and <b>Pink</b> <b>Floyd</b> responded by attaching a huge set of male genitalia to the balloon's underside to distinguish it from Waters' design. By November 1987, Waters gave up, and on 23 December a legal settlement was finally reached at a meeting on Astoria. Mason and Gilmour were allowed use of the <b>Pink</b> <b>Floyd</b> name in perpetuity, and Waters would be granted, among other things, rights to The Wall. However, Waters claimed {{that they would never}} have the level of success that they had during his tenure again.|$|E
