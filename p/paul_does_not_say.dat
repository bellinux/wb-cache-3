6000|$|But rather reprove these dark works, says St Paul; that is, look at them, and {{see that}} they are utterly {{worthless}} and damnable. And how? [...] "All things that are reproved," [...] he says, [...] "are made manifest by the light. For whatsoever makes manifest is light." [...] Whatsoever makes manifest, that is, makes plain and clear. Whatsoever makes you see anything or person in heaven or earth as it really is; whatsoever makes you understand more about anything; whatsoever shows you more what you are, where you are, what you ought to do; whatsoever teaches you any single hint about your duty to God, or man, or the dumb beasts which you tend, or the soil which you till, or the business and line of life which you ought to follow; whatsoever shows you the right and the wrong in any matter, the truth and the falsehood in any matter, the prudent course and the imprudent course in any matter; in a word, whatsoever makes your mind more clear about any single thing in heaven or earth, is light. For, mind, St. <b>Paul</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>say,</b> whatsoever is light makes things plain; but whatsoever makes things plain is light. That is saying a great deal more, thank God; for if he had said, whatsoever is light makes things clear, we should have been puzzled to know what was light; we should have been tempted to settle for ourselves what was light. And, God knows, people in all ages, and people of all religions, Christians as well as heathens, have been tempted to say so, and to misread this text, till they said: [...] "Whatsoever agrees with our doctrine is light, of course, but all other teaching is darkness, and comes from the devil;" [...] and so they oftentimes blasphemed against God's Holy Spirit by calling good actions bad ones, just because they were done by people who did not agree with them, and fell into the same sin as the Pharisees of old, who said that the Lord cast out devils by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.|$|E
60|$|For bear in mind, that St. <b>Paul</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>say,</b> if {{one member}} suffers, {{all the rest}} ought to suffer with it: he says that they do suffer with it. He does not say merely, {{that we ought to}} feel for our fellow townsmen; he says, that God has so {{tempered}} the body together as to force one member to have the same care of the others as of itself; that if we do not care to feel for them, we shall be made to feel with them. One limb cannot choose whether or not it will feel the disease of another limb. If one limb be in pain, the whole body must be uneasy, whether it will or not. And if one class in a town, or parish, or county, be degraded, or in want, the whole town, or parish, or county, must be the worse for it. St. Paul is not preaching up sentimental sympathy: he is telling you of a plain fact. He is not saying, 'It is a very fine and saintly thing, and will increase your chance of heaven, to help the poor.' He is saying, 'If you neglect the poor, you neglect yourself; if you degrade the poor, you degrade yourself. His poverty, his carelessness, his immorality, his dirt, his ill-health, will punish you; for you and he are members of the same body, knit together inextricably for weal or woe, by the eternal laws according to which the Lord Jesus Christ has constituted human society; and if you break those laws, they will avenge themselves.'--My friends, do we not see them avenge themselves daily? The slave-holder refuses to acknowledge that his slave {{is a member of the}} same body as himself; but he does not go unpunished: the degradation to which he has brought his slave degrades him, by throwing open to him. the downward path of lust, laziness, ungoverned and tyrannous tempers, and the other sins which have in all ages, slowly but surely, worked the just ruin of slave-holding states. The sinner is his own tempter, and the sinner is his own executioner: he lies in wait for his own life (says Solomon) when he lies in wait for his brother's. Do you see the same law working in our own free country? If you leave the poor careless and filthy, you can obtain no good servants: if you leave them profligate, they make your sons profligate also: if you leave them tempted by want, your property is unsafe: if you leave them uneducated, reckless, improvident, you cannot get your work properly done, and have to waste time and money in watching your workmen instead of trusting them. Why, what are all poor-rates and county-rates, if you will consider, but God's plain proof to us, that the poor are members of the same body as ourselves; and that if we will not help them of our own free will, we shall find it necessary to help them against our will: that if we will not pay a little to prevent them becoming pauperized or criminal, we must pay a great deal to keep them when they have become so? We may draw a lesson--and a most instructive one it is--from the city of Liverpool, in which it was lately proved that crime--and especially the crime of uneducated boys and girls--had cost, in the last few years, the city many times more than it would cost to educate, civilize, and depauperize the whole rising generation of that city, and had been a tax upon the capital and industry of Liverpool, so enormous that they would have submitted to it from no Government on earth; and yet they had been blindly inflicting it upon themselves for years, simply because they chose to forget that they were their brothers' keepers.|$|E
5000|$|The Epistle to Philemon {{has become}} an {{important}} text in regard to slavery; it was used by pro-slavery advocates {{as well as by}} abolitionists. In the epistle, Paul writes that he is returning Onesimus, a fugitive slave, back to his master Philemon; however, Paul also entreats Philemon to regard Onesimus as a beloved brother in Christ, rather than as a slave. Cardinal Dulles points out that, [...] "while discreetly suggesting that he manumit Onesimus, <b>Paul</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> that Philemon is morally obliged to free Onesimus and any other slaves he may have had." ...|$|E

5000|$|Paul the Deacon, in {{his opening}} chapter, names several peoples (Vandals, Rugii, Heruli, Turcilingi) who have come, he says, from Germania to Italy. He goes on to name the Lombards as latecomers from the same region. This passage is clearly based on Jordanes, but its {{reference}} to Germany is unique. Nonetheless, <b>Paul</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> that the Turcilingi are Germans, but only that they came from: [...] "The Goths indeed, and the Wandals, the Rugii, Heroli, and Turcilingi, and also other fierce and barbarous nations have come from Germany." [...] The Turcilingi appear to have originated in Germany, perhaps near the Baltic Sea, and thence moved with the Huns into Gaul and finally to the Danube, possibly Noricum, before entering Italy with Odoacer.|$|E
5000|$|In verse 29 Paul {{notes that}} at Corinth there existed a {{practice}} whereby a living {{person would be}} baptized instead of some convert who had recently died. Mormons interpret this passage to support their practice of Baptism for the dead. This principle of vicarious work for the dead is an important work of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the dispensation of the fulness of times. This interpretation is rejected by all other denominations of Christianity. Teignmouth Shore, writing in Ellicott's Commentary for Modern Readers, notes that [...] "there have been numerous and ingenious conjectures as {{to the meaning of}} this passage. The only tenable interpretation is that there existed amongst some of the Christians at Corinth a practice of baptising a living person in the stead of some convert who had died before that sacrament had been administered to him. Such a practice existed amongst the Marcionites in the second century, and still earlier amongst a sect called the Corinthians." [...] The Jerusalem Bible states that [...] "What this practice was is unknown. <b>Paul</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> if he of approved it or not: he uses it merely for an ad hominem argument".|$|E
5000|$|Paul's Epistle to Philemon was an {{important}} text for both pro-slavery advocates and abolitionists. [...] This short letter, reputedly written to be delivered by the hand of Onesimus, a fugitive slave, whom Paul is sending back to his master Philemon. Paul entreats Philemon to regard Onesimus as a beloved brother in Christ. Cardinal Dulles points out that, [...] "while discreetly suggesting that he manumit Onesimus, <b>Paul</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> that Philemon is morally obliged to free Onesimus and any other slaves he may have had." [...] He does, however, encourage Philemon to welcome Onesimus [...] "not as a slave, but {{as more than a}} slave, as a beloved brother". (According to tradition, Philemon did free Onesimus, and both were eventually recognized as saints by the Church.) Seldom noted in the debate was the situation of Onesimus if he had not returned: an outlaw and a fugitive with limited options to support himself, and in constant fear of discovery and punishment. Be that as it may, as T. David Curp observes, [...] "Given that the Church received Philemon as inspired Scripture, Paul's ambiguity effectively blocked the early Fathers of the Church from denouncing slavery outright." ...|$|E

5000|$|While Curran {{might say}} that {{masturbation}} could be morally acceptable on certain conditions, according to Richard A. Spinello, Pope John <b>Paul</b> II <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> that masturbation is always immoral because [...] "the physical act itself is wrong and disordered". He <b>does</b> <b>not</b> examine the physical act as the sole basis for moral judgment. In Veritatis splendor, John Paul II holds that [...] "the morality of the human act" [...] is judged by considering what one chooses rationally by [...] "the deliberate will", and by [...] "the proximate end". In his encyclical, he writes: [...] "In {{order to be able}} to grasp the object of an act which specifies that act morally, it is therefore necessary to place oneself in the perspective of the acting person." [...] Masturbation not always incurs grave sin, or mortal sin, but it can not be said that masturbation is not [...] "gravely wrong" [...] nor constitutes [...] "grave matter". Joseph Farraher concludes that masturbation incurs venial sin in case [...] "the act is performed with only partial realization or only partial choice of the will", or, in Harvey's words, [...] "no grievous sin ... while lacking in awareness, as when he is half awake, or half asleep, or when a person is carried away by sudden passion and finds himself committing the act despite the resistance of the will".|$|R
40|$|As Betz {{observed}} in 1979, Paul never says that Christians {{are supposed to}} 'do' the Torah. This article seeks to develop the argument of omission in relation to Paul and the law. What else <b>does</b> he <b>not</b> <b>say?</b> According to Rom. 2. 17 - 29, Jews 'rely on' the law, 'boast' in the law, know God’s will through the law, are educated in the law, have light, knowledge and truth because of the law, are to 'do', 'observe' and 'keep' the law, on occasions 'transgress' the law, and possess the law as a 'written code'. <b>Not</b> only <b>does</b> <b>Paul</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> these things about Christians vis-à-vis the law, he shifts the focus from the law to something else using the same words and concepts.
