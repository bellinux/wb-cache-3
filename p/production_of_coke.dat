30|$|Petroleum coke is {{the main}} {{byproduct}} of the petroleum refining process, {{and it can be}} used for electrodes or fuel. Owing to a continuous demand for crude oil, the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> petroleum <b>coke</b> in China is increasing steadily (Zhou et al. 2012). Petroleum coke is a cheap fuel traditionally used as an important feedstock for circulating fluidized bed combustors because of its high calorific value, low volatile content, and high sulfur content (He et al. 2011). Therefore, achieving efficient and clean utilization <b>of</b> petroleum <b>coke</b> has become an urgent issue. To this end, some utilization technologies are worthy of being explored in depth (Wu et al. 2009). One of the most efficient ways <b>of</b> using petroleum <b>coke</b> is by mixing it with water to make a slurry fuel, which is then pumped into boilers and gasifiers as feedstock for combustion and gasification (Milenkova et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2006).|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this DOE-funded effort is to develop {{continuous}} processes for solvent extraction of coal for the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> carbon products.

Because GrafTech material is usually fully graphitized (i. e., heat treated at 3100 C), very high purity is automatically achieved. The degree of graphitization controls properties such as CTE, electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity, and density. Thus it is usually possible to correlate these properties using a single parameter. CTE has proven to be a useful index for the quality <b>of</b> <b>coke.</b> Pure graphite actually has a slightly negative coefficient of thermal expansion, whereas more disordered carbon has a positive coefficient...|$|R

The final product, calcined coke, is primarily used to make carbon anodes for the aluminum industry and recarburizing agent for industries such as the steel industry.
