40|$|Imagine a {{situation}} in which you are sent dozens of new <b>data</b> <b>files,</b> by a varying number of users, which must be processed on a daily basis. Perhaps the users are at other locations and are FTP-ing the <b>data</b> <b>files</b> to a designated “data directory. ” Perhaps the users are within your organization and are writing the <b>data</b> <b>files</b> from other operating systems to a data directory allocated via a Samba share drive. Perhaps the users are all on a shared server within your organization and are writing new <b>data</b> <b>files</b> to a <b>data</b> directory on the same system. Whatever the case, this scenario usually generates a lot of maintenance to the SAS program that processes the <b>data</b> <b>files.</b> When new users are added, you must modify your program to allocate and process their specific files. When users are removed, you must modify your program so that it does not attempt to allocate and process their <b>data</b> <b>files.</b> And, when a given file is not present for one reason or another, you must add logic so that your program does not abend. This paper presents a methodology of automatically processing a varying number of new <b>data</b> <b>files</b> from a <b>data</b> directory. The paper presents three straightforward SAS programs that make the process simple and error-free. After reading this paper, {{you should be able to}} tailor the three SAS programs to process <b>data</b> <b>files</b> in your own organization...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- In data {{processing}} {{it is common}} to have many <b>data</b> <b>files</b> resulted from using various operations on a given original <b>data</b> <b>file</b> for different purposes. Since each operation has its own algorithm and is designed for carrying out a specific task, each resultant <b>data</b> <b>file</b> will need an independent presentation. If we need to present the features processed by multiple operations into one presentation so that the relationships among the processed features in different files can be revealed, a new system that is capable of not only managing all the resultant <b>data</b> <b>files,</b> but also carrying out some manipulations on these <b>data</b> <b>files</b> is required. In this paper, we propose a neural network-based system that can not only coordinate all the results from traditional processing, but also integrate different <b>data</b> <b>files</b> into one presentation. The general structure of this neural system is described firstly, and then three examples are used to test the usefulness of this system. The results show that this neural system is adaptive and meets the needs of managing and manipulating digital data for different purposes...|$|R
