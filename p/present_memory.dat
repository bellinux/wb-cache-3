60|$|I {{remember}} recovering private judgment {{indeed in}} the course of two or three days following the excursion I have just noted; which must have shaped themselves in some sort of consonance with the idea that as we were hereabouts in the very middle of dim Etruria a common self-respect prescribed our somehow profiting by the fact. This kindled in us the spirit of exploration, but with results of which I here attempt to record, so utterly does the whole impression swoon away, for <b>present</b> <b>memory,</b> into vagueness, confusion and intolerable heat, Our self-respect was of the common order, but the blaze of the July sun was, even for Tuscany, of the uncommon; so that the project of a trudging quest for Etruscan tombs in shadeless wastes yielded to its own temerity. There comes back to me nevertheless at the same time, from the mild misadventure, and quite as through this positive humility of failure, the sense of a supremely intimate revelation of Italy in undress, so to speak (the state, it seemed, in which one would most fondly, most ideally, enjoy her); Italy no longer in winter starch and sobriety, with winter manners and winter prices and winter excuses, all addressed to the forestieri and the philistines; but lolling at her length, with her graces all relaxed, and thereby only the more natural; the brilliant performer, in short, en famille, the curtain down and her salary stopped for the season--thanks to which she is by so much more the easy genius and the good creature as she is by so much less the advertised prima donna. She received us nowhere more sympathetically, that is with less ceremony or self- consciousness, I seem to recall, than at Montepulciano, for instance--where it was indeed that the recovery of private judgment I just referred to couldn't help taking place. What we were doing, or what we expected to do, at Montepulciano I keep no other trace of than is bound up in a present quite tender consciousness that I wouldn't for the world not have been there. I think my reason must have been largely just in the beauty of the name (for could any beauty be greater?), reinforced no doubt by the fame of the local vintage and the sense of how we should quaff it on the spot. Perhaps we quaffed it too constantly; since the romantic picture reduces itself for me but to two definite appearances; that of the more priggish discrimination so far reasserting itself as to advise me that Montepulciano was dirty, even remarkably dirty; and that of her being not much else besides but perched and brown and queer and crooked, and noble withal (which is what almost any Tuscan city more easily than not acquits herself of; all the while she may on such occasions figure, when one looks off from her to the end of dark street- vistas or catches glimpses through high arcades, some big battered, blistered, overladen, overmasted ship, swimming in a violet sea).|$|E

5000|$|Washburn's motor theory {{attempted}} {{to find common}} ground between the structuralist tradition of her mentor, Titchener, which focused exclusively on consciousness and the rising view of behaviorism, which dismissed consciousness in favor of visible actions. Washburn's motor theory argued that all thought {{can be traced back to}} bodily movements. According to her theory, consciousness arises when a motion or a tendency towards movement is partially inhibited by a tendency towards another movement. In the presence of an object, the senses create an impression of it, including vision, sight, feel etc. This is accompanied by an incipient sense of movement, either towards or from the object. Different objects evoke different senses of motor readiness. When the object is not <b>present,</b> <b>memory</b> re-evokes those sensations. Learning consists of an association of movements into a set of regular series and combinations. When two movements become closely linked in quick succession, the sense of movement from the first primes the next, beginning a series. Ideas are organized the same way. Thinking becomes a derivative of movements of the hands, eyes, vocal cords, and trunk muscles (remember the thinker's pose). In summary: ...|$|E
5000|$|Kim {{made his}} {{literary}} debut in 1973 when his poem [...] "Celebration for the Ship Leaving Port" [...] won a literary contest {{sponsored by the}} JoongAng Ilbo. Running throughout Kim's poetry is an abiding concern with memory - not one of a beautiful past but one of suffering. In Kim's work, memory resembles a sickness, a disease which limits one's ability to move about freely. While memory {{is concerned with the}} past, it also possesses the power to torment the self living in the present. Insofar as it is only through direct confrontation with memory that the self can be healed, this memory of a scarred, wounded past, however, cannot be secreted away or forgotten. Memory in Kim's poetry centers around two overwhelmingly dark images - his father and the Korean War. Born in 1946, Kim's childhood was inextricably entwined with the experience of war. This memory of a childhood shattered by war emerges in the poem [...] " [...] Kentucky House 1". As we see in the poem [...] "Father in the Rain", the memory of receiving no protection {{in the midst of the}} extremities of war points to the rejection of a certain absolute, symbolized here by the father. By reviving memories of childhood suffering, the poet aims to release himself from past experiences which cloud his life in the <b>present.</b> <b>Memory</b> enables the poet to discover the other within the self; this other, in turn, opens new possibilities for the self. In Kim's poetry, then, confrontation with the past seeks to broaden one's range of emotions in order to open the possibility of true experience. As his career moved on Kim MyungIn began by writing poems directly inspired by the sufferings of orphans and the most wretched in society, but then turned to subjects more often related to nature and more directly reflective of his own inner world.|$|E
