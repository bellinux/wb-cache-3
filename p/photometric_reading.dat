Because {{the length of the}} optical path in the “Photo-Elisa 1 ” is only 1. 2 mm, volumes as small as 15 zL can be measured. Accuracy is enhanced through cancellation of background absorbance by mea-surement at two wavelengths. Results obtained with the kit compare well with those by radloimmunoassay.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the optimal experimental conditions to develop a methodology for microbiological assay of apramycin employing microplate and kinetic reading mode, and to validate the developed method, through evaluation of parameters of selectivity, linearity, linear range, limits of detection and quantification, accuracy and precision. The turbidimetric assay principle is simple: the test solution is added to a suspension of test microorganism in culture media, the mixture is incubated under appropriate conditions and the microbial growth is measured by <b>photometric</b> <b>reading.</b> Microplate with kinetic reading mode employed in antibiotic assay is of considerable interest since it allows reduction of material and analysis time and enables a large number of samples to be analyzed simultaneously, with automated reading and calculating. Established conditions considered the standard-curve of apramycin at concentrations from 5. 0 to 35. 0 &# 956;g mL- 1, and tryptic soy broth inoculated with 5 % Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739) suspension. Satisfactory results were obtained with 2 hours of incubation. The developed method showed appropriate selectivity, linearity in the range from 5. 0 to 35. 0 &# 956;g mL- 1, limits of detection and quantification of 0. 1 and 0. 4 &# 956;g mL- 1, respectively, as well as satisfactory accuracy (recuperation = 98. 5 %) and precision (RSD = 6. 0 %).

40|$|The present paper {{dealt with}} a {{quantitative}} assay of tissue glycogen by means of skatole reaction. A liver piece (about 0. 4 g in weight) taken from the frog Rana catesbiana was heated in 40 % KOH solution for 2 hr. The glycogen was precipitated by addition of 99. 5 % ethanol to the muddy material. After dissolved this crude glycogen with warmed distilled water (at 35 ℃), somewhat purified glycogen was obtained by centrifugation after addition of 99. 5 % ethanol. The glycogen was again dissolved in 10 ml of distilled water, and diluted with 9 times volume of distilled water. Thus, 1 ml of this solution contained one hundredth of the original amount of glycogen. To 1 ml of this solution, 10 ml of 36 % HCl solution and 0. 5 ml of 0. 5 % skatole solution in 99. 5 % ethanol were added and immersed in a water-bath at boiling temperature for 3 min. The mixture showed color change to rosy violet. The <b>photometric</b> <b>reading</b> was done at 510 nm. In repeated trials of the method, the authors give the following formula to have the weight of tissue glycogen (L) in relation with the read of optical density (β) : L= 69. 115 mg×β. ウシガエル(Rana catesbiana) の肝臓片を用い,グリコーゲンの精製と,スカトール試薬による定量を行った。肝臓片を 40 %KOHで加水分解した後,グリコーゲンを 99. 5 %エタノールで析出させ, 35 ℃に加温した蒸留水に溶かした。このような析出と溶解をもう一度繰り返すと,かなり純粋なグリコーゲンを得ることが出来た。 100 倍に希釈したグリコーゲン溶液 1 ml, 36 %HCl溶液 10 ml,スカトールの 0. 5 %エタノール溶液 0. 5 mlを加えた後,沸騰水中で 3 分間加熱し発色させ,その発色液の 510 nmにおけるoptical density(β) を測定する。このβ値から,肝臓片中のグリコーゲン量(L) を求める式L(mg) = 69. 115 (mg) ×βを得た...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} quick and easy semiquantitative tests for the detection of serum immunoglobulins that are commonly used for to trace the foals with the failure of passive immunity transfer. We compared the four most employed methods – zinc sulphate turbidity tests using <b>photometric</b> or visual <b>reading,</b> glutaraldehyde test and refractometric determination of total protein concentration in serum. Radial immunodiffusion test was used as a reference method. Thirty-eight blood serum samples from foals were used for quantitative estimation of immunoglobulins. The tested methods were correlated with reference method and their availability for tracing of cases of unsuccessful passive transfer immunogobulins was evaluated. The results obtained so far have not allowed us to recommend without reservation any of the compared methods as a reliable test for the determination of blood serum Ig concentrations in newborn foals. On the other hand, the practical usefulness of two of the tested methods (visual reading of turbidity, refractometry) for rapid field identification of hypogammaglobulinaemic foals was confirmed. Of the two, we prefer the refractometric method (sensitivity: 94. 11; specificity: 83. 30 and predictive value: 88) for common use because it is quicker and easier than other methods. This study pointed out the critical points of the mentioned problem, which have to be studie...|$|R
40|$|Recent silver-activated glass {{dosimeters}} {{are superior}} to photographic film and thermoluminescent dosimeters for many reasons described briefly, especially in high-level accident dosimetry, because fast dose evaluation {{and the possibility of}} remeasuring doubtful values are necessary. A main disadvantage of glass dosimeters is possible changes in the fluorimetric or in the <b>photometric</b> dose <b>reading</b> between exposure and evaluation. These changes have to be considered if exact dose readings are desired, UV irradiation can induce or destroy radiation-induced fluorescence and colour centres in the glass, depending on the quantum energy of the UV light. More important, in practice, is the increase of the measured RPL immediately after exposure, superimposed later by the fading process. Increase and decrease rates depend strongly on the storage temperature and the composition of the glass. For instance, the increase after exposure decreases with increasing si!ver concentration in a glass with constant basic composition, and fading occurs earlier. At constant silver concentration there is also an effect of different glass base compositions. There are no observable differences in the kinetics of X-ray, γ-ray and thermal neutron effects in the glass. In the 10 ^- 4 to ^ 3 r γ dose range (fluorimetric dose reading) the kinetic behaviour of the RPL centres determines this effect, while in the 10 ^ 3 to 10 ^ 7 r dose range the somewhat different stability of the absorption centres is important if absorption measurements are taken (the fading depends on the wavelength of the photometric measurement and is lowest at the 320 nm absorption band), If fluorimetric measurements are also taken, the superimposing effects determine the dose reading because of the UV absorption in the glass at the fluorimetric: reading. A brief theoretical interpretation of the kinetics in irradiated glass is given by means of a simplified band model of the physical processes involved. A general expression, for the possible radiation effect alterations is given, After a high-dose exposure the glass can be regenerated by a special heat treatmem. Too extended heating or too high temperatures may increase the predose, In practice the possible inaccuracies in the dose measurement can be overcome by: (a) A short heat treatment of the glass stabilization or "development" of the radiation effect); or (b) The use of the correction curves given in the paper. The UV-induced RPL behaves somewhat differently...|$|R

The test, a 96 -well microtitre plate, is based on the inhibition of microbial growth (Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores). It was validated in accordance with European Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC (2002). The specificity and detection capabilities for five compounds from major antimicrobial families and robustness were studied. The specificity of the test was assessed with four different animal species and was found to be very satisfactory (false-positive rates lower than 10 %). The detection capabilities for amoxicillin (10 μg kg- 1) and tylosin (100 μg kg- 1) were at the maximum residue limit (MRL) level (50 and 100 μg kg- 1, respectively) for both, for doxycycline (200 μg kg- 1) and sulfathiazole (200 μg kg- 1) at twice the MRL (100 μg kg- 1 for each) and for cefalexin (500 μg kg- 1) at 2. 5 times the MRL (200 μg kg- 1). Twenty-one samples were analysed in parallel with the Four Plate Test, the STAR protocol and the Explorer® test.

40|$|Concerns {{regarding}} {{the presence of}} drug residues in foods include allergic reactions, toxicity, technological problems in fermented products {{and the development of}} antibiotic resistance in human pathogens. The analysis of antimicrobial residues in foods is generally carried out, in a first step, through microbiological screening tests. These tests commonly use Geobacillus stearothermophilus as target specie but show a low ability to detect quinolones. The goal of our study was to evaluate the performance of a new microbiological test (Equinox) for detection of quinolone residues in muscle. The kit contains an ampoule with a standardized number of freeze-dried Escherichia coli and must be diluted with a specific detection medium containing a redox indicator. Microbial growth will modify the redox potential of the medium being observed through a colour change (from blue to brown/orange). Equinox limits of detection for most of tested quinolones (enrofloxacin, norfloxacin, sarafloxacin, marbofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, danofloxacin and difloxacin) were below or around maximum residue limit (MRL) UE and CCβ values obtained corresponded with the determined sensitivities. In contrast, flumequine could not be detected at MRL UE levels. Moreover, Equinox displayed a low sensitivity to other antimicrobials. Sensitivity data obtained in vitro were consistent when testing incurred muscle samples. Matrix constituents, test batch and animal species did not affect the performance of the test. Equinox could be easily automated enabling a large numbers of simultaneous analysis, and a <b>photometric</b> <b>reading</b> can be applied for a precise interpretation. The results obtained in this study prove that Equinox is a useful tool when screening for quinolone residues or can be combinedwith othermethods for screening of unknown sample...|$|E
