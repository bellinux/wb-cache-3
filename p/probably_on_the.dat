5|$|Church of the Holy Archangels (Սրբոց Հրեշտակապետաց եկեղեցի, Srbots Hreštakapetats yekeğetsi; Deir Al Zeitoun) {{was founded}} in the 12th century <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ruins of an ancient church in the 4th century.|$|E
5|$|Chesney {{was active}} in his diocese; more than 240documents {{relating}} to his episcopal career survive. They show him mediating disputes between religious houses and granting exemptions and rights in his diocese. Chesney {{bought a house in}} London to serve as an episcopal residence, constructed an episcopal palace in Lincoln, and founded a religious house outside the city. He died in December 1166, <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 27th, and was buried in Lincoln Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Mapenor died in April 1219, <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 16th, {{although}} older sources give a {{date of the}} 13th. He {{had issued}} a charter as recently as 14 April 1219. He was buried in Hereford Cathedral. One of his surviving charters documents a licence given to Leominster Priory as alms for the souls of his parents and his predecessor as bishop, Giles de Braose.|$|E

5|$|Alexander {{spent most}} of 1145 and 1146 at the papal court in Rome, {{although}} some time during that period he was in England {{as one of the}} witnesses to the peace accord signed between the earls of Chester and Leicester. He returned to the papal court, then at Auxerre, in 1147, but he was back in England by {{the time of his death}} the following year. Henry of Huntingdon says that Alexander picked up his last illness while travelling. Alexander died in February 1148, <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 20th, as that was the date on which his death was commemorated at Lincoln Cathedral, and he was buried at Lincoln on 25 February 1148. No tomb remains, but 12th-century documents record that Alexander left the cathedral a number of books, mostly biblical works.|$|E
5|$|Boletus edulis {{grows in}} some areas where it is not {{believed}} to be indigenous. It is often found underneath oak and silver birch in Hagley Park in central Christchurch, New Zealand, where {{it is likely to}} have been introduced, <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roots of container-grown beech, birch, and oak in the mid-19th century—around the time exotic trees began to be planted in the Christchurch area. Similarly, it has been collected in Adelaide Hills region of Australia in association with three species of introduced trees. It has been growing plentifully in association with pine forests in the southern KwaZulu-Natal Midlands in South Africa for more than 50 years and {{is believed to have been}} introduced with the import of pine trees. It also grows in pine plantations in neighboring Zimbabwe.|$|E
5|$|In September 1918, Holden {{transferred}} to the Imperial War Graves Commission (now the Commonwealth War Graves Commission) with the new rank of major. From 1918 until 1928 he worked on 69 Commission cemeteries. Initially, Holden ran the drawing office and worked as the senior design architect under the three principal architects in France and Belgium (Edwin Lutyens, Reginald Blomfield and Herbert Baker). Holden worked on the experimental war cemetery at Louvencourt and, according to Geurst and Karol, <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> one at Forceville that {{was selected as the}} prototype for all that followed.|$|E

5|$|Medina {{surrendered}} peacefully to Roger I of Sicily {{after a short}} siege in 1091, and Malta {{was subsequently}} incorporated into the County and later the Kingdom of Sicily, being dominated by a succession of feudal lords. The fortifications of Mdina were rebuilt and modified {{a number of times}} over the following centuries. A castle known as the Castellu di la Chitati or the castrum civitas was built on the southeast corner of the city near the main entrance, <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site of an earlier Byzantine fort. The city withstood a siege by Hafsid invaders in 1429.|$|E
5|$|On 9 January 1610, {{works on}} the {{aqueduct}} continued {{under the direction of}} another Jesuit called Padre Natale Tomasucci. By this time, Garzez had died and was succeeded as Grand Master by Alof de Wignacourt. In July 1612, the Bolognese hydraulic expert Bontadino de Bontadini took over the project, <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> recommendation of Inquisitor Evangelista Carbonesi. Bontadini designed a new watercourse with water being carried through underwater pipes, and over stone arches when there were depressions in the ground. Bontadini was assisted by a Maltese capomastro Giovanni Attard and several other engineers. 600 local workers were employed {{in the construction of the}} aqueduct, which was completed in 1614 and inaugurated on 21 April 1615. The aqueduct cost a total of 434,605 scudi, most of which were paid by Grand Master Wignacourt. The aqueduct was therefore named in his honour.|$|E
5|$|The Manor of Deptford or West Greenwich was {{bestowed}} by William the Conqueror upon Gilbert de Magminot or Maminot, {{bishop of}} Lisieux, {{one of the}} eight barons associated with John de Fiennes for the defence of Dover Castle. Maminot held the head of his barony at Deptford and according to John Lyon writing in 1814, he built himself a castle, or castellated mansion at Deptford, of which all traces had by then long since been buried in their ruins, but from the remains of some ancient foundations which had been discovered the site was <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> brow of Broomfield, near the Mast Dock and adjacent to Sayes Court.|$|E

5|$|Vitalian fled to {{his native}} Thrace and {{remained}} in hiding until Anastasius's death in 518. As a staunch promoter of Chalcedonian orthodoxy, he was pardoned by the new emperor Justin I (r. 518–527) and was engaged in the negotiations with the Pope to end the Acacian Schism. He was named consul for the year 520, but was murdered shortly after, <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> orders of Justin's nephew and heir-apparent, Justinian (r. 527–565), who saw in him a potential rival for the throne. His sons also became generals in the East Roman army.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from Rome, Robert refused to consecrate Spearhafoc, the Abbot of Abingdon and the king's goldsmith, as his {{successor to the}} bishopric of London, claiming that Pope Leo IX had forbidden the consecration. Almost certainly the grounds were simony, the purchase of ecclesiastical office, as Leo had recently issued proclamations against the practice. In refusing to consecrate Spearhafoc, Robert may have been following his own interests against the wishes of both the king and Godwin, as {{he had his own}} candidate, a Norman, in mind. In the end Robert's favoured candidate, William the Norman, was consecrated instead of Spearhafoc. Robert also discovered that some lands belonging to Canterbury had fallen into Godwin's hands, but his efforts to recover them through the shire courts were unsuccessful. Canterbury had lost control of some revenues from the shire of Kent to Godwin during Eadsige's tenure as archbishop, which Robert unsuccessfully attempted to reclaim. These disputes over the estates and revenues of the archbishopric contributed to the friction between Robert and Godwin, which had begun with Robert's election. Robert's election had disrupted Godwin's patronage powers in Canterbury, and now Robert's efforts to recover lands Godwin had seized from Canterbury challenged the earl's economic rights. Events came to a head at a council held at Gloucester in September 1051, when Robert accused Earl Godwin of plotting to kill King Edward. Godwin and his family were exiled; afterwards Robert claimed the office of sheriff of Kent, <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> strength of Eadsige, his predecessor as Archbishop, having held the office.|$|E
5|$|By 1823 Cofresí was <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{crew of the}} corsair barquentine El Scipión, captained by José Ramón Torres {{and managed}} by his cousin (the first mayor of Mayagüez, José María Ramírez de Arellano). Historians agree, since several {{of his friends and}} family members benefited from the sale of stolen goods. Cofresí may have joined to evade the authorities, honing skills he would use later in life. El Scipión {{employed}} questionable tactics later associated with the pirate, such as flying the flag of Gran Colombia so other ships would lower their guard (as she did in capturing the British frigate Aurora and the American brigantine Otter). The capture of Otter led to a court order requiring restitution, affecting the crew. At this time, Cofresí turned to piracy. Although the reasons behind his decision are unclear, several theories have been proposed by researchers. In Orígenes portorriqueños Ramírez Brau speculates that Cofresí's time aboard El Scipión, or seeing a family member become a privateer, may have influenced his decision to become a pirate after the crew's pay was threatened by the lawsuit. According to Ursula Acosta, a lack of work for privateers ultimately pushed Cofresí into piracy.|$|E

25|$|Tempeh {{originated}} in today's Indonesia, <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island of Java. Soybean {{as the main}} tempeh ingredient has been recognized in Java and mentioned as kadêlê in an old Javanese manuscript Serat Sri Tanjung around the 12th to 13th century. The earliest known reference to tempeh appeared in 1815 in the Serat Centhini.|$|E
25|$|Jerpoint Abbey is a Cistercian abbey near Thomastown. It was {{constructed}} in 1180, <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site of an earlier Benedictine monastery built in 1160 by Domnall Mac Gilla Patraic, King of Osraige. Jerpoint is notable for its stone carvings, including one at the tomb of Felix O'Dulany, Bishop of the Diocese of Ossory when the abbey was founded.|$|E

25|$|The name Hackney {{derives from}} a 5th or 6th century Saxon {{settlement}} known as Haca's ey – or raised ground in marshland. The settlement was near Hackney Brook, and was <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> higher ground around the later St Augustine's Tower. Hackney is not mentioned by {{name in the}} Norman Domesday Book; at that time it formed {{a part of the}} manor of Stepney.|$|E
25|$|December 16, 1811, 0815 UTC (2:15a.m.); (M ~7.5) {{epicenter}} {{in northeast}} Arkansas, <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Cottonwood Grove fault; it caused only slight damage to man-made structures, {{mainly because of}} the sparse population in the epicentral area. The future location of Memphis, Tennessee was shaken at Mercalli level nine intensity. A seismic seiche propagated upriver and Little Prairie was destroyed by liquefaction. Local uplifts of the ground and the sight of water waves moving upstream gave observers the impression that the Mississippi River was flowing backwards.|$|E
25|$|It was built, <b>probably</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site of {{an earlier}} fort, by Sir George Crichton in the 1440s. At this time, Blackness was the main port serving the Royal Burgh of Linlithgow, {{one of the main}} residences of the Scottish monarch. The castle, {{together}} with the Crichton lands, passed to James II of Scotland in 1453, and the castle has been crown property ever since. It served as a state prison, holding such prisoners as Cardinal Beaton and the 6th Earl of Angus.|$|E
