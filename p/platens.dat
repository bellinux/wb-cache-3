5|$|Injection {{moulding}} machines {{consist of}} a material hopper, an injection ram or screw-type plunger, and a heating unit. Also known as <b>platens,</b> they hold the moulds in which the components are shaped. Presses are rated by tonnage, which expresses the amount of clamping force that the machine can exert. This force keeps the mould closed during the injection process. Tonnage can vary from less than 5 tons to over 9,000 tons, with the higher figures used in comparatively few manufacturing operations. The total clamp force needed {{is determined by the}} projected area of the part being moulded. This projected area is multiplied by a clamp force of from 1.8 to 7.2 tons for each square centimetre of the projected areas. As a rule of thumb, 4 or 5 tons/in2 can be used for most products. If the plastic material is very stiff, it will require more injection pressure to fill the mould, and thus more clamp tonnage to hold the mould closed. The required force can also be determined by the material used {{and the size of the}} part. Larger parts require higher clamping force.|$|E

In September 1761, Werner rode from <b>Platens</b> to meet the troops from Poland. On 12 September, he was placed with 2,000 men against the Russians at Treptow on the Riga. After heavy losses, he was captured by the Russians and taken to Königsberg, where he remained until the end of 1762. When Peter III became Tsar, he freed Werner, but tried to convince him to join the Russian army. Werner returned to Frederick's army in Silesia. There he became commander of a corps, which first came from Upper Silesia to Moravia, then joined the army the Duke of Bevern at Peterswalde in Lower Silesia. On 16 August 1762, he and Zieten routed an army of 47,000 commanded by Leopold Joseph von Daun near Reichenbach. He then moved back to Upper Silesia. After the war, Werner became the commander of Naugarten. [...] Afterward, his troops guarded the Silesian border.|$|E

This made the Hanover Court very brilliant. In honour of his high guests, the king gave several fêtes; among others, a magnificent masked ball, in the green theatre at Herrenhausen—the garden theatre, with linden and box for screen, and grass for a carpet, where the <b>Platens</b> had danced to George and his father the late sultan. The stage and a great part of the garden were illuminated with coloured lamps. Almost the whole Court appeared in white dominos, “like,” says the describer of the scene, “like spirits in the Elysian fields. At night, supper was served in the gallery with three great tables, and the king was very merry. After supper dancing was resumed, and I did not get home till five o’clock by full daylight to Hanover. Some days afterwards we had in the opera-house at Hanover, a great assembly. The king appeared in a Turkish dress; his turban was ornamented with a magnificent agraffe of diamonds; the Lady Yarmouth was dressed as a sultana; nobody was more beautiful than the Princess of Hesse.” So, while poor Caroline was resting in her coffin, dapper little George, with his red face and his white eyebrows and goggle-eyes, at sixty years of age, is dancing a pretty dance with Madame Walmoden, and capering about dressed up like a Turk! For twenty years more, that little old Bajazet went on in this Turkish fashion, until the fit came which choked the old man, when he ordered the side of his coffin to be taken out, {{as well as that of}} poor Caroline’s who had preceded him, so that his sinful old bones and ashes might mingle with those of the faithful creature. O strutting Turkey-cock of Herrenhausen! O naughty little Mahomet! in what Turkish paradise are you now, and where be your painted houris? So Countess Yarmouth appeared as a sultana, and his Majesty in a Turkish dress wore an agraffe of diamonds, and was very merry, was he?

With {{the help}} of the {{orthogonal}} experiment and the friction-wear mechanism by car as the research object of the clutch driven <b>platen</b> friction plate of Chongqing Changan CX 20 auto power take-off installation, the optimization of clutch friction materials is studied.

It was analyzed for the abrasion mechanism of the clutch driven <b>platen</b> friction plate between the flywheel and the pressure plate,and discussed for the relationship of driven <b>platen</b> friction-plate heat recession-performance and the driven plate material at high temperature. The results show that the friction factor of the optimized driven <b>platen</b> lining materials do not change.

50|$|In textile screen printing, a platen is a {{flat board}} onto which the {{operator}} slides the garment. It is generally made of either a plywood laminate or aluminum {{with a rubber}} laminate. Often the platen will be pretreated with a spray adhesive. This allows the garment to effectively become a rigid immobile substrate, especially important when printing multiple colors or utilizing an on-press infrared dryer. The screen is brought parallel {{and close to the}} garment (often within 1/32") and the squeegee pressure then brings the screen into contact with the garment so that the ink transfer may occur. There are many special platen types, such as those for printing sleeves or pockets, vacuum <b>platens,</b> <b>platens</b> with clamps to hold bulky materials such as jackets, and even curved <b>platens</b> for printing on hats.|$|E
