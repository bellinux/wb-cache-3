40|$|The {{efficacy}} {{of a new}} live attenuated <b>parvovirosis</b> vaccine was tested in conventional ducklings against Derzsy’s disease by comparing two vaccination regimens. Ducklings were vaccinated with either one injection at 17 days of age or two injections at 1 and 17 days of age. Controls and vaccinated ducklings were challenged with a virulent Derzsy strain at 21 days of age (day 20). Weight was measured on days 20, 34 and 42 / 43. Surviving birds were necropsied on day 42 / 43. Protection rates were significantly higher in the groups vaccinated once (90 per cent, P= 0. 003) and twice (95 per cent, P< 0. 001) than {{in the control group}} (59 per cent). The bodyweight was significantly higher in both vaccinated groups than in the control group on day 34 (P= 0. 008 and P< 0. 001, respectively) and day 42 / 43 (P< 0. 001 for both groups). The growth was significantly higher in the group vaccinated twice than the group vaccinated once on day 34 (P= 0. 047) and day 42 / 43 (P= 0. 017). Both vaccination regimens provided a quick onset of immunity. The higher weight gain in the group vaccinated twice suggests that an early vaccination at hatchery followed by a second injection at 17 days of age is an optimal and practical schedule to prevent <b>parvovirosis...</b>|$|E

40|$|Most {{veterinary}} {{departments in}} European universities {{have to provide}} students training, research, and community services with limited human resources. The situation is particularly challenging in clinics and paraclinics where daily duties are a heavy time load. As an example, up to 2007, the Department of Pathology of the University of Liège could only benefit from 2 academic and 3 temporary staff positions. The workload encompassed theoretical and practical training (in series), necropsy duties (around 1800 cases at year), and histopathological diagnosis (about 1500 slides per year).

40|$|Dogs {{share with}} humans several {{zoonotic}} diseases {{as well as}} some important determinants of degenerative syndromes and tumours. For this reason, systematic surveillance on small animal disease carried out through the collection and analysis of necropsy records could be helpful to public health. To describe the causes of death in dogs from the province of Rome (Italy) submitted to the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale del Lazio e della Toscana for necropsy during 2003 – 2007, a retrospective study was conducted on diagnostic data of 870 dogs. The final diagnosis was established by anatomo-histopathological examinations and, when needed, by ancillary laboratory tests. The most common causes of death were 'infectious disease' (23 %) and 'poisoning' (17 %). In 5 % of the cases, the cause remained undetermined. The frequency of 'poisoning' was higher (39 %) in stray dogs, while 'infectious disease' was more frequent (49 %) in dogs from breeding farms. <b>Parvovirosis</b> was the most frequent infectious disease (33 %) while anticoagulants accounted for 30 % of the cases involving toxicity. Death by neoplastic lesions was quite infrequent (7 %). Findings from this study provide veterinarians with an overview of the causes of death in dogs and it could provide public health authorities with new data about both novel and re-emerging threats...|$|E

40|$|In Nigeria, {{knowledge}} on the epidemiology of diseases of dogs is limited. A retrospective study {{of data from}} clinical records of six veterinary clinics was undertaken to determine the incidence of disease in owned dogs in Delta State, Nigeria from 2012 to 2014. Association between the diagnosed diseases and the studied variables was explored using Chi-Squared test statistics. This study revealed {{that most of the}} conditions presented to the veterinary clinics were preventable. Thirty-one (31) clinical conditions were diagnosed from 571 cases recorded, involving nonspecific (21. 6 %), infectious (70. 9 %; P= 0. 001) and non-infectious (7. 5 %) diseases. The most occurring clinical conditions comprised helminthoses (21. 4 %), mange (10. 5 %), <b>parvovirosis</b> (8. 4 %), babesiosis (7. 9 %), septicemia (7. 2 %), gastroenteritis (7. 0 %), myiasis (7. 0 %), trauma (6. 3 %), poisoning (6. 0 %), ectoparasitism (3. 7 %), ascites (2. 5 %), dermatitis (2. 3 %), aural hematoma (1. 2 %), and orchitis (1. 1 %). Disease incidence was highest in Alsatian (40. 3 %), mixed/cross (33. 1 %), Rottweiler (7. 0 %) and toy breeds (4. 6 %). Details on the least occurring diseases and the association between disease and the studied variables are given. The outcomes demonstrate the prevalence of the clinical conditions diagnosed, inadequate husbandry and veterinary care accorded to owned dogs in the State. Education of dog owners on preventive measures is paramount in alleviating some of these health problems...|$|E
40|$|Parvoviral {{infection}} of swine {{is a disease}} which is manifested in reproductive disorders in sows and gilts {{in the form of}} anestria, premature births, miscarriages, mummified fetuses, the birth of poorly vital piglets and/or a reduced number of piglets in the litter. The infection is present in farms with intensive breeding conditions {{in the form of an}} endemic infection, all over the world, and also in our country. Timely diagnostics and adequate prophylaxis prevent the occurrence and spread of this disease. Experimental investigations covered 21 sows, divided into two experimental and a third, the control, group. Animals of the first experimental group were vaccinated once before exposure to the boar using an inactivated vaccine, Porcilis Parvo, and animals of the second experimental group were vaccinated twice at an interval of 3 weeks, also using an inactivated vaccine, Parvovax. Sows of the control group were not vaccinated. Blood samples were taken from all animals four times during the course of the experiment, and specific antibodies against the swine parvovirus were determined using the method of hemagglutination inhibition (HI test). The results of the investigations indicate that there was an increase in the titre of specific antibodies following the vaccination of persistently infected sows with the swine parvivirus, and that the present antibodies did not prevent the creating of an immune response. It was established following a comparison of the geometric mean values of antibody titres of vaccinated sows that there was a significant increase in the antibody level following the two vaccinations using the Parvovax vaccine, against the titre values in sows vaccinated once with the Porcilis Parvo vaccine. In control animals, the average value of the antibody level was many times lower in comparison with the established values in the experimental groups. This provides justification for the implementation of immunoprophylaxis against swine <b>parvovirosis</b> by the vaccination of sows and gilts before mating using inactivated vaccines...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the scope}} of this thesis the {{development}} of the present knowledge about Canine Distemper throughout history is described. Different opinions of practitioners, scientists and amateurs during the single eras as well as the problems and errors while coping {{with one of the most}} dangerous diseases of dog are explained. One can trace early occurrence of Canine Distemper up to the age of Aristoteles. Since 1761 Canine Distemper spread through europe. At this time numerous presumptions exist regarding the etiology of the disease, and corresponding to this the methods of treatment were quite adventurous. In 1809 Jenner was probably one of the first who gave a more reliable description of Canine Distemper. Also the first attempts to develop a vaccination took place in this period. At the end of the 19 th century Canine Distemper was described as the probably most frequent disease of dog. Up to this time various bacteriological findings failed to proove associations with Canine Distemper. The diagnosis was set up exclusively by clinical symptoms which were described well at this time. However, the prognosis ever was formulated. The situation about 1900 was characterized by an intensive search for the infectious agent of Canine Distemper, for possibilities of therapy and prophylaxis. In 1905 Carre succeded to reproduce the disease in susceptable dogs with germ-free nasal mucus of infected dogs. By this experiment the virus etiology was prooved basically and confirmed finally in 1926 by Duncin and Landlow who established the ferret as an adequate test animal in the Distemper research. In the middle of the 20 th century the germ of Canine Distemper was recognized as a virus of the morbilli genus in the paramyxo virus family. In this period one succeeded also in adapting the virus to embryonated eggs and in cultivating it in culture tissues. These to milesteps met the requirements for developing a vaccine. Due to immunoprophylaxis and antibiotic treatment the classical clinical appearance of Canine Distemper changed. Modern methods of virology and molecular biology lead to new insights in the nature of this RNA virus. The disease transfer to man resp. ist contribution to other diseases was discussed, but could not be confirmed until now. All Canidae, Procyonidae and Mustelidae are considered to be susceptible. Despite vaccination Canine Distemper is next to Canine <b>Parvovirosis</b> still the most important viral disease of dog with worldwide importance attributable to ocasional epidemics. The dog is the main reservoir of the virus. There is a need for more investigations concerning the importance of wild species as virus reservoir. From the present status of knowledge a causal therapy of Cannine Distemper is impossible. Prophylaxis by vaccination is still the most important disease prevention. Conclusively, Canine Distemper still has to be considered as a disease with an uncertain prognosis...|$|E
