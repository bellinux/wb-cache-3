40|$|We show {{theoretically}} {{that the}} radiation picture of small trains of closely <b>packed</b> <b>light</b> pulses with Gaussian input profile, exhibits both some similar features and some fundamental differences {{when compared to}} the radiating behavior of a solitary pulse in a dispersion-managed optical fiber system. For small map strengths, the pulse trains strongly radiate away energy, and there, the total amount of radiated energy increases linearly {{as a function of the}} length of the pulse train. For large map strengths, the amount of radiated energy increases rather smoothly as a function of the length of the pulse train. We establish the existence of a map strength region, in which light pulses with initially Gaussian-shaped profile executes a non-radiative propagation over transoceanic distances.

Effect of compact thermal packaging approaches and challenges are investigated for a next generation automotive LED lighting. A challenging three-purpose in one (3 i 1) highly packaged light emitting diodes (LEDs) lighting system has been studied computationally and experimentally. A tightly <b>packed</b> <b>light</b> engine printed circuit board (PCB) with both LEDs and electronics in a very hermetically sealed enclosure close to the vehicle engine department pose significant thermal and mechanical challenges for the thermal design as well as optical considerations. Challenge is due to local high ambient temperatures and aggressive operating conditions. Finite element based computational models have been developed first to study a single package thermal performance, and then followed by system level computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. Later, a series of experiments and analytical studies have been performed for validation of computational results. It is found that interface layer at the package poses significant bottlenecks for meeting the design requirements. System level CFD models showed that having a two-sided flame retardant (FR 4) based board causes local hot spots that need innovative system level cooling solutions.

50|$|Vests, or packs, are {{strapped}} onto players, {{and have}} on them {{a number of}} sensors encased in clear plastic which are designed to detect the infrared light which is shot by the phasors. Six sensors are located {{on the front and}} back of the pack, on each shoulder and on the phasor itself. The sensors are surrounded by coloured LEDs which light up in the colour of the player's team. Players are known to be active when their <b>pack</b> <b>lights</b> are flashing. When a player's sensors are shot by another player, the player is said to be deactivated, and will remain this way for a number of seconds. During this time the player's sensors and <b>pack</b> <b>lights</b> are turned off, along with the player's phasor, so he or she cannot shoot for this time either. The player will be reactivated after a period of time that differs depending on the game's settings.|$|R

After 2030, the study states that new battery chemistries will probably shift to other source materials, making <b>packs</b> <b>lighter,</b> smaller, and cheaper.|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a pacing device consisting {{of a series of}} surface-mount light emitting diodes (leds) attached to a sub-mm thickness flexible-printed-circuit-board substrate. The device is sufficiently thin to be embedded in the floor-covering in a gait laboratory. Leds are illuminated in sequence to give the impression of movement and thus act as a visual cue for speed of locomotion. The ability of the system to control speed was compared to subjective instructions and a metronome for one subjective instructions and a metronome for one subject at 3 walking and 2 running speeds. The <b>packing</b> <b>lights</b> produced the smallest spread of speeds at most desired speeds and also more closely matched the cadence-speed (or stride length-speed) relationship of unconstrained walking.

Thus many mishaps were Shefford's fortune.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to a food's expiration date, the main considerations for hiking food are water content, caloric density (more energy per pound for a given space), and nutritional density (more nutrition per pound for a given space). Water weighs one gram per cubic centimeter, or 8.33 pounds per gallon, so a 4-liter (1 gallon) food container can weigh up to eight pounds less when it contains dehydrated food. Dehydrating foods can reduce weight and may reduce nutrition while increasing the need for water to reconstitute the food. More weight also expends more energy, so <b>packing</b> <b>lighter</b> foods reduces {{the need for more}} calories. Calories equate to energy. Nutrition becomes more important as the number of hiking days increases; for example MREs are not intended to be used beyond ten days. Multi-vitamins may help offset some nutrition deficiencies.|$|R

60|$|Sore backs.--Sore backs are {{the plague}} of beasts of burden; for, if the skin be once broken, it will never heal {{thoroughly}} again during the whole journey. Every precaution should, therefore, be taken at first starting: the saddles should be well-stuffed; the saddle-cloths ample, and without hem or edging (blankets {{are as good as}} any); the journeys should be short; the <b>packs</b> <b>light</b> and carefully balanced; rests of a day or two should frequently be given, and salt-water should be rubbed on the back. Travelling in the very early morning is found to be bad for animals' backs; but travelling late at night is not so. An Australian correspondent remarks, that a party of travellers or explorers in Australia, on leaving their camp, invariably saddle their horses with ample saddle-cloths below the saddle, and assist each other by turns, to fold the cloths in various ways. For instance, if the ridge of the back, or wither, should be found galled, the cloth would be folded up, so that the saddle should rest entirely on the two folded pads, as in the figure.--Other modes of folding will suggest themselves, according {{to the way in which}} the back may be rubbed.|$|R
