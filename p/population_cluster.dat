Here we combine population genetic methods (microsatellites) with phylogenetic information (mtDNA) to define genetic <b>population</b> <b>clusters</b> of the wide-spread Neotropical túngara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus). We measure gene flow and migration within and between <b>population</b> <b>clusters</b> and compare genetic diversity between <b>population</b> <b>clusters.</b> By applying ecological niche modeling we determine whether the two most divergent genetic groups of the túngara frog (1) inhabit different habitats, and (2) are separated geographically by unsuitable habitat across {{a gap in the}} distribution. Results: Most population structure is captured by dividing all sample localities into two allopatric genetic lineages. The Northern genetic lineage (NW Costa Rica) is genetically homogenous while the Southern lineage (SW Costa Rica and Panama) is sub-divided into three <b>population</b> <b>clusters</b> by both microsatellite and mtDNA analyses. Gene flow is higher within the Northern lineage than within the Southern lineage, perhaps due to increased landscape heterogeneity in the South.

40|$|Background: The {{integration}} of multiple complementary approaches {{is a powerful}} way to understand the processes of diversification and speciation. The parasitoid wasp Aphidius transcaspicus Telenga (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is a parasitoid of Hyalopterus aphids across a wide geographic range. This species shows a remarkable degree of genetic structure among western, central, and eastern Mediterranean <b>population</b> <b>clusters.</b> In this paper we attempt to better characterize this genetic structure. Methodology/Principal Findings: We use a Bayesian coalescent analysis of gene flow under the Isolation with Migration model using mitochondrial and microsatellite markers together with climate-based ecological niche models {{to better understand the}} genetic structure of A. transcaspicus in the Mediterranean. The coalescent analysis revealed low levels of migration among western and eastern Mediterranean populations (Nm, 1) that were not statistically distinguishable from zero. Niche models showed that localities within <b>population</b> <b>clusters</b> each occupy areas of continuously high environmental suitability, but are separated from each other by large regions of completely unsuitable habitat that could limit dispersal. Overall, environmental characteristics were similar among the <b>population</b> <b>clusters,</b> though significant differences did emerge.

40|$|Abstract Background Uncovering how {{populations of}} a species differ genetically and ecologically is {{important}} for understanding evolutionary processes. Here we combine population genetic methods (microsatellites) with phylogenetic information (mtDNA) to define genetic <b>population</b> <b>clusters</b> of the wide-spread Neotropical túngara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus). We measure gene flow and migration within and between <b>population</b> <b>clusters</b> and compare genetic diversity between <b>population</b> <b>clusters.</b> By applying ecological niche modeling we determine whether the two most divergent genetic groups of the túngara frog (1) inhabit different habitats, and (2) are separated geographically by unsuitable habitat across {{a gap in the}} distribution. Results Most population structure is captured by dividing all sample localities into two allopatric genetic lineages. The Northern genetic lineage (NW Costa Rica) is genetically homogenous while the Southern lineage (SW Costa Rica and Panama) is sub-divided into three <b>population</b> <b>clusters</b> by both microsatellite and mtDNA analyses. Gene flow is higher within the Northern lineage than within the Southern lineage, perhaps due to increased landscape heterogeneity in the South. Niche modeling reveals differences in suitable habitat between the Northern and Southern lineages: the Northern lineage inhabits dry/pine-oak forests, while the Southern lineage is confined to tropical moist forests. Both lineages seem to have had little movement across the distribution gap, which persisted during the last glacial maximum. The lack of movement was more pronounced for the Southern lineage than for the Northern lineage. Conclusions This study confirms the finding of previous studies that túngara frogs diverged into two allopatric genetic lineages north and south of the gap in the distribution in central Costa Rica several million years ago. The allopatric distribution is attributed to unsuitable habitat and probably other unknown ecological factors present across the distribution gap. Niche conservatism possibly contributes to preventing movements across the gap and gene flow between both groups. Genetic and ecological data indicate that there is the potential for ecological divergence in allopatry between lineages. In this context we discuss whether the Northern and Southern lineages should be recognized as separate species, and we conclude that further studies of pre- and post-zygotic isolation are needed for a final assessment. Identified <b>population</b> <b>clusters</b> should motivate future behavioral and ecological research regarding within-species biodiversity and speciation mechanisms. </p...|$|R

40|$|Measures of {{population}} differentiation, such as FST, are traditionally {{derived from the}} partition of diversity within and between populations. However, the emergence of <b>population</b> <b>clusters</b> from multilocus analysis {{is a function of}} genetic structure (departures from panmixia) rather than of diversity. If the populations are close to panmixia, slight differences between the mean pairwise distance within and between populations (low FST) can manifest as strong separation between the <b>populations,</b> thus <b>population</b> <b>clusters</b> are often evident even when the vast majority of diversity is partitioned within populations rather than between them. For any given FST value, clusters can be tighter (more panmictic) or looser (more stratified), and in this respect higher FST does not always imply stronger differentiation. In this study we propose a measure for the partition of structure, denoted EST, which is more consistent with results from clustering schemes. Crucially, our measure is based on a statistic of the data that is a good measure of internal structure, mimicking the information extracted by unsupervised clustering or dimensionality reduction schemes. To assess the utility of our metric, we ranked various human (HGDP) population pairs based on FST and EST and found substantial differences in ranking order. EST ranking seems more consistent with <b>population</b> <b>clustering</b> and classification and possibly with geographic distance between populations.
