40|$|Genome {{analysis}} of ciliates identified {{a new type}} of polyubiquitin-like genes. These contain tandem repeats of ubiquitin-like domains interspersed with autocata-lytic intein-like domains. Inteins and related protein domains post-translationally process their own precur-sor proteins by protein-splicing, cleavage and ligation reactions. The structure of these polyubiquitin-like genes suggests their <b>precursor</b> <b>products</b> undergo matu-ration and conjugation in cis. This novel gene structure also illustrates the genetic modularity of ubiquitin-like and intein-like domains. Our suggested autoprocessing of ubiquitin-like polyproteins is a new potential general way for controlling protein functions. Ubiquitins are among the few protein types unique to eukaryotic cells [1].

Nociceptin inhibited IBa in all LC neurons, (pD 2 of 8. 9, maximum inhibition 50 %). The inhibition of IBa by nociceptin was associated with slowing of the activation of IBa and could be significantly reversed by a strong depolarizing prepulse. Phe 1 ψ-nociceptin 1 – 13 also inhibited IBa in LC neurons (notional pD 2 of 7. 6, maximum inhibition 18 %). Application of Phe 1 ψ-nociceptin 1 – 13 (1 [*]μM) significantly occluded the subsequent effects of a co-application of nociceptin (3 [*]nM) on IBa. As previously reported for nociceptin, Phe 1 ψ-nociceptin 1 – 13 caused an outward current in LC neurons voltage clamped at − 60 [*]mV (pD 2 of 7. 1, maximum current 50 % of that of methionine enkephalin, 10 [*]μM). The Phe 1 ψ-nociceptin 1 – 13 induced current reversed polarity at − 112 [*]mV and exhibited pronounced inward rectification. Phe 1 ψ-nociceptin 1 – 13 (1 [*]μM) reversibly inhibited the current caused by nociceptin (300 [*]nM) by 30 %. Neither nocistatin nor rat prepronociceptin 154 – 181 inhibited IBa in LC neurons, or prevented the subsequent inhibition by nociceptin. Neither nocistatin or prepronociceptin 154 – 181 affected the membrane properties of LC neurons. This study demonstrates that nociceptin modulates somatic IBa in rat LC neurons. The putative ORL 1 antagonist Phe 1 ψ-nociceptin 1 – 13 exhibited partial agonist activity at inhibiting IBa and opening K+ channels in LC.

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, we reported that nafoxidine (UA) stimulated {{the synthesis of}} a uterine protein showing the same electrophoretic mobility as the 'estrogen-induced protein' (E 2 -IP) first described by Notides and Gorski. In the present work, we analyzed the IP-containing electrophoretic zone by SDS polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, and found that estradiol- 17 β (E 2) and nafoxidine stimulated the synthesis of different proteins. As expected, estradiol- 17 β stimulated the synthesis of the E 2 -IP of 46, 000 M(r). On the other hand, UA stimulated the synthesis of 27, 000 and 30, 000 M(r) proteins (UA-IP).

40|$|RATIONALE Soft ionization, {{high-resolution}} {{mass spectrometry}} {{is widely used}} to characterize large biological molecules, such as proteins. Deconvolution ('deisotoping') of isotopic envelopes (iEs) in biological mass spectra into monoisotopic or average masses is challenging due to low signals and heavily overlapped iEs, resulting in many wrong interpretations. METHODS Isotopic envelopes (iEs) are directly used without deisotoping to identify biological molecules. An algorithm, isotopic mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and envelope fingerprinting (iMEF), was implemented in the ProteinGoggle search engine for top-down intact protein database searching. iMEF combines isotopic m/z fingerprinting (iMF) and isotopic envelop fingerprinting (iEF), where 'Isotopic mass-to-charge ratio' means the m/z value of the most abundant isotopic peak within the iE of a <b>precursor</b> or <b>product</b> ion. iMF is used to 'fish' <b>precursor</b> or <b>product</b> ion candidates from the database, which is pre-built and contains all iE information (<b>precursor</b> and <b>product</b> ions) of all proteoforms of the studied system. iEF identifies matching <b>precursor</b> or <b>product</b> ions. A protein is finally identified with user-specified total number of matching product ions and post-translational modification scores. RESULTS The working principles of iMEF and ProteinGoggle, and {{the definition of a}} set of related parameters and scoring metrics, are illustrated with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometric analysis of a mixture of ubiquitin and the HUMAN histone H 4 proteoforms. Ubiquitin was confidently identified from its CID, ETD, and HCD spectra with 57, 91, and 66 matching product ions, respectively; 125 proteoforms were confidently found from the H 4 dataset. The locations of PTMs in 54 and 6 isoforms were partially and fully identified. CONCLUSIONS Database search with iMEF bypasses 'deisotoping' avoiding associated errors, and also provides full quality control of matching <b>precursor</b> and <b>product</b> ions and finally protein IDs. Overlapped iEs of different product ions could also be confidently unwrapped in situ. Improvement and addition of more functionalities and utilities of ProteinGoggle are underway.

Over the past 30 years numerous techniques and materials have been introduced and evaluated clinically and have included guided tissue regeneration, bone grafting materials, growth and other biological factors and gene therapy.

All of the products have shown efficacy in promoting periodontal regeneration in animal models but the results in humans remain variable and equivocal concerning attaining complete biological regeneration of damaged periodontal structures.

40|$|The larger genome segment, segment A, of {{infectious}} bursal disease virus (IBDV) encodes VP 2, VP 3 and VP 4 as a precursor polyprotein. The viral protease, VP 4, is responsible for self-processing of the polyprotein, however, there are additional secondary <b>precursor</b> <b>products</b> such as VPX whose further processing has not been defined. Expression of IBDV cDNAs in vitro with rabbit reticulocyte lysates in a coupled transcription-translation system and in the Sindbis virus expression system (with BHK- 21 and Vero cell cultures) were used to study processing of the polyprotein. In both expression systems, we identified three main gene products with molecular masses of 48, 34, and 30. 5 kDa corresponding to VPX, VP 3, and VP 4, respectively, as found in IBDV-infected Vero cell cultures, although the amount of each product was variable. A translational time course of the polyprotein gene and analyses of products specified by various sub-clones of the full-length cDNA were used to distinguish primary processing products of translation from secondary products generated by proteolytic processing during in vitro coupled transcription-translation expression. The VPX, VP 3 and VP 4, which are the primary processing products, first appeared after 20 min of incubation and their production was maximum by 75 min of the coupled transcription-translation reaction.

Primary and secondary RVM neurons were identified as responding to the κ-opioid receptor agonist U- 69593 (300 nm to 1 μm) and the μ- and δ-opioid receptor agonist met-enkephalin (10 μm), respectively. Both primary and secondary RVM neurons responded to nociceptin (3 nm to 1 μm) with an outward current that reversed polarity at – 115 mV in brain slices and with inhibition of Ca 2 + channel currents in acutely isolated cells. The putative ORL 1 antagonist J- 113397 (1 μm) produced no change in membrane current and abolished the outward current produced by nociceptin (100 nm). In contrast, Phe 1 ψ(CH 2 -NH) Gly 2]-nociceptin-(1 - 13) NH 2 (300 nm to 1 μm) alone produced an outward current and partially reduced the outward current produced by nociceptin (300 nm) when co-applied. In brain slices nociceptin (300 nm) reduced the amplitude of evoked GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) but not non-NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). Met-enkephalin (10 μm), but not nociceptin (300 nm), reduced the rate of spontaneous miniature IPSCs in normal external potassium solution (K+ 2. 5 mm). In high external potassium (K+ 17. 5 mm), nociceptin reduced the rate of miniature IPSCs in the presence (Ca 2 + 2. 4 mm, Mg 2 + 1. 2 mm) {{but not in the}} absence of external calcium (Ca 2 + 0 mm, Mg 2 + 10 mm, Cd 2 + 10 μm).

40|$|The {{influence}} {{of changes in}} the conditions of sol-gel method on the thermal characteristics and the structure electrochromic (EC) а-WO 3 films. DSC data showed greater sensitivity of the structure to the peculiarities of the drying of the product poliperoxo-tungstic acid. The Films were transparent over a wide range (Eg = 2, 5 eV). All compositions were amorphous as measured by X-rays diffraction. Based on the IR and Raman spectroscopy dates was concluded the presence in the structure of amorphous transparent glassy semiconductor a-WO 3 predominantly tetrahedral [WO 4] groups. The <b>precursor</b> <b>product</b> and EC-films are glass material, obtained by the sol-gel process, with the composition WO 3 * x H 2 O. Synthesis peculiarities of mesoporous a-WO 3. affects both the pore structure, which determines the concentration of the aqueous components and the ratio of the bridging W-O-W and unbridged W = O bonds, defining characteristics of the electrochromic material...|$|R
