30|$|The other {{possible}} reason for choosing hexanol as an alcohol is that hexanol is a 6 -carbon straight-chain alcohol that has great {{potential as a}} blending component with diesel fuel owing to its higher energy density, higher cetane number, better blend stability and less hygroscopic nature than other widely studied lower alcohols like ethanol, methanol, and even butanol (De <b>Poures</b> et al. 2017). The latent heat of vaporization, density, and viscosity of hexanol is also closer to that of diesel fuel compared to other alcohols (De <b>Poures</b> et al. 2017).|$|R

[...] So spake th' Apostate Angel, though in pain, [...] Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare: [...] And him thus answer'd soon his bold Compeer.

[...] But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now [...] Of force believe Almighty, since no less [...] Then such could hav orepow'rd such force as ours) [...] Have left us this our spirit and strength intire [...] Strongly to suffer and support our pains, [...] That we may so suffice his vengeful ire, [...] Or do him mightier service as his thralls [...] By right of Warr, what e're his business be [...] 150 [...] Here {{in the heart of}} Hell to work in Fire, [...] Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep; [...] What can it then avail though yet we feel [...] Strength undiminisht, or eternal being [...] To undergo eternal punishment? [...] Whereto with speedy words th' Arch-fiend reply'd. [...] Fall'n Cherube, to be weak is miserable [...] Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure, [...] To do ought good never will be our task, [...] But ever to do ill our sole delight, [...] 160 [...] As being the contrary to his high will [...] Whom we resist. If then his Providence [...] Out of our evil seek to bring forth good, [...] Our labour must be to pervert that end, [...] And out of good still to find means of evil; [...] Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps [...] Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb [...] His inmost counsels from their destind aim. [...] But see the angry Victor hath recall'd [...] His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit [...] 170 [...] Back to the Gates of Heav'n: The Sulphurous Hail [...] Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid [...] The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice [...] Of Heav'n receiv'd us falling, and the Thunder, [...] Wing'd with red Lightning and impetuous rage, [...] Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now [...] To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep. [...] Let us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn, [...] Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe. [...] Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde, [...] 180 [...] The seat of desolation, voyd of light, [...] Save what the glimmering of these livid flames [...] Casts pale and dreadful? Thither let us tend [...] From off the tossing of these fiery waves, [...] There rest, if any rest can harbour there, [...] And reassembling our afflicted Powers, [...] Consult how we may henceforth most offend [...] Our Enemy, our own loss how repair, [...] How overcome this dire Calamity, [...] What reinforcement we may gain from Hope, [...] 190 [...] If not what resolution from despare. [...] Thus Satan talking to his neerest Mate [...] With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes [...] That sparkling blaz'd, his other Parts besides [...] Prone on the Flood, extended long and large [...] Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge [...] As whom the Fables name of monstrous size, [...] Titanian, or Earth-born, that warr'd on Jove, [...] Briarios or Typhon, whom the Den [...] By ancient Tarsus held, or that Sea-beast [...] 200 [...] Leviathan, which God of all his works [...] Created hugest that swim th' Ocean stream: [...] Him haply slumbring on the Norway foam [...] The Pilot of some small night-founder'd Skiff, [...] Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell, [...] With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind [...] Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night [...] Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes: [...] So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay [...] Chain'd on the burning Lake, nor ever thence [...] 210 [...] Had ris'n or heav'd his head, but that the will [...] And high permission of all-ruling Heaven [...] Left him at large to his own dark designs, [...] That with reiterated crimes he might [...] Heap on himself damnation, while he sought [...] Evil to others, and enrag'd might see [...] How all his malice serv'd but to bring forth [...] Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn [...] On Man by him seduc't, but on himself [...] Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour'd. [...] 220 [...] Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool [...] His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames [...] Drivn backward slope their pointing spires, & rowld [...] In billows, leave i'th' midst a horrid Vale. [...] Then with expanded wings he stears his flight [...] Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air [...] That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land [...] He lights, if it were Land that ever burn'd [...] With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire; [...] And such appear'd in hue, as when the force [...] 230 [...] Of subterranean wind transports a Hill [...] Torn from Pelorus, or the shatter'd side [...] Of thundring Aetna, whose combustible [...] And fewel'd entrals thence conceiving Fire, [...] Sublim'd with Mineral fury, aid the Winds, [...] And leave a singed bottom all involv'd [...] With stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole [...] Of unblest feet. Him followed his next Mate, [...] Both glorying to have scap't the Stygian flood [...] As Gods, and by their own recover'd strength, [...] 240 [...] Not by the sufferance of supernal Power. [...] Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime, [...] Said then the lost Arch Angel, this the seat [...] That we must change for Heav'n, this mournful gloom [...] For that celestial light? Be it so, since hee [...] Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid [...] What shall be right: fardest from him is best [...] Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream [...] Above his equals. Farewel happy Fields [...] Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail [...] 250 [...] Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell [...] Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings [...] A mind not to be chang'd by Place or Time. [...] The mind is its own place, and in it self [...] Can make a Heav'n of Hell, a Hell of Heav'n. [...] What matter where, if I be still the same, [...] And what I should be, all but less then hee [...] Whom Thunder hath made greater? Here at least [...] We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built [...] Here for his envy, will not drive us hence: [...] 260 [...] Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce [...] To reign is worth ambition though in Hell: [...] Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav'n. [...] But wherefore let we then our faithful friends, [...] Th' associates and copartners of our loss [...] Lye thus astonisht on th' oblivious Pool, [...] And call them not to share with us their part [...] In this unhappy Mansion, or once more [...] With rallied Arms to try what may be yet [...] Regaind in Heav'n, or what more lost in Hell? [...] 270 [...] So Satan spake, and him Beelzebub [...] Thus answer'd. Leader of those Armies bright, [...] Which but th' Omnipotent none could have foyld, [...] If once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledge [...] Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft [...] In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge [...] Of battel when it rag'd, in all assaults [...] Their surest signal, they will soon resume [...] New courage and revive, though now they lye [...] Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire, [...] 280 [...] As we erewhile, astounded and amaz'd, [...] No wonder, fall'n such a pernicious highth. [...] He scarce had ceas't when the superiour Fiend [...] Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield [...] Ethereal temper, massy, large and round, [...] Behind him cast; the broad circumference [...] Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb [...] Through Optic Glass the Tuscan Artist views [...] At Ev'ning from the top of Fesole, [...] Or in Valdarno, to descry new Lands, [...] 290 [...] Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe. [...] His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine [...] Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the Mast [...] Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand, [...] He walkt with to support uneasie steps [...] Over the burning Marle, not like those steps [...] On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime [...] Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire; [...] Knotholes he so endur'd, till on the Beach [...] Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call'd [...] 300 [...] His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans't [...] Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks [...] In Vallombrosa, where th' Etrurian shades [...] High overarch't imbowr; or scatterd sedge [...] Afloat, when with fierce Winds Orion arm'd [...] Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew [...] Busiris and his Memphian Chivalrie, [...] While with perfidious hatred they pursu'd [...] The Sojourners of Goshen, who beheld [...] From the safe shore their floating Carkases [...] 310 [...] And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown [...] Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood, [...] Under amazement of their hideous change. [...] He call'd so loud, that all the hollow Deep [...] Of Hell resounded. Princes, Potentates, [...] Warriers, the Flowr of Heav'n, once yours, now lost, [...] If such astonishment as this can sieze [...] Eternal spirits; or have ye chos'n this place [...] After the toyl of Battel to repose [...] Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find [...] 320 [...] To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav'n? [...] Or in this abject posture have ye sworn [...] To adore the Conquerour? who now beholds [...] Cherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood [...] With scatter'd Arms and Ensigns, till anon [...] His swift pursuers from Heav'n Gates discern [...] Th' advantage, and descending tread us down [...] Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts [...] Transfix us {{to the bottom of this}} Gulfe. [...] Awake, arise, or be for ever fall'n. [...] 330 [...] They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung [...] Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch [...] On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread, [...] Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake. [...] Nor did they not perceave the evil plight [...] In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel; [...] Yet to their Generals Voyce they soon obeyd [...] Innumerable. As when the potent Rod [...] Of Amrams Son in Egypts evill day [...] Wav'd round the Coast, up call'd a pitchy cloud [...] 340 [...] Of Locusts, warping on the Eastern Wind, [...] That ore the Realm of impious Pharoah hung [...] Like Night, and darken'd all the Land of Nile: [...] So numberless were those bad Angels seen [...] Hovering on wing under the Cope of Hell [...] 'Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires; [...] Till, as a signal giv'n, th' uplifted Spear [...] Of their great Sultan waving to direct [...] Thir course, in even ballance down they light [...] On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain; [...] 350 [...] A multitude, like which the populous North [...] Pour'd never from her frozen loyns, to pass [...] Rhene or the Danaw, when her barbarous Sons [...] Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread [...] Beneath Gibraltar to the Lybian sands.

[...] Say, Muse, their Names then known, who first, who last, [...] Rous'd from the slumber, on that fiery Couch, [...] At thir great Emperors call, as next in worth [...] Came singly where he stood on the bare strand, [...] While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof? [...] 380 [...] The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell [...] Roaming to seek their prey on earth, durst fix [...] Their Seats long after next the Seat of God, [...] Their Altars by his Altar, Gods ador'd [...] Among the Nations round, and durst abide [...] Jehovah thundring out of Sion, thron'd [...] Between the Cherubim; yea, often plac'd [...] Within his Sanctuary it self their Shrines, [...] Abominations; and with cursed things [...] His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan'd, [...] 390 [...] And with their darkness durst affront his light. [...] First Moloch, horrid King besmear'd with blood [...] Of human sacrifice, and parents tears, [...] Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud [...] Their childrens cries unheard, that past through fire [...] To his grim Idol. Him the Ammonite [...] Worshipt in Rabba and her watry Plain, [...] In Argob and in Basan, to the stream [...] Of utmost Arnon. Nor content with such [...] Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart [...] 400 [...] Of Solomon he led by fraud to build [...] His Temple right against the Temple of God [...] On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove [...] The pleasant Vally of Hinnom, Tophet thence [...] And black Gehenna call'd, the Type of Hell. [...] Next Chemos, th' obscene dread of Moabs Sons, [...] From Aroer to Nebo, and the wild [...] Of Southmost Abarim; in Hesebon [...] And Heronaim, Seons Realm, beyond [...] The flowry Dale of Sibma clad with Vines, [...] 410 [...] And Eleale to th' Asphaltick Pool. [...] Peor his other Name, when he entic'd [...] Israel in Sittim on their march from Nile [...] To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe. [...] Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg'd [...] Even to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove [...] Of Moloch homicide, lust hard by hate; [...] Till good Josiah drove them thence to Hell. [...] With these came they, who from the bordring flood [...] Of old Euphrates to the Brook that parts [...] 420 [...] Egypt from Syrian ground, had general Names [...] Of Baalim and Ashtaroth, those male, [...] These Feminine. For Spirits when they please [...] Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft [...] And uncompounded is their Essence pure, [...] Not ti'd or manacl'd with joynt or limb, [...] Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones, [...] Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose [...] Dilated or condens't, bright or obscure, [...] Can execute their aerie purposes, [...] 430 [...] And works of love or enmity fulfill.

Thammuz came next behind, [...] Whose annual wound in Lebanon allur'd [...] The Syrian Damsels to lament his fate [...] In amorous dittyes all a Summers day, [...] While smooth Adonis from his native Rock [...] 450 [...] Ran purple to the Sea, suppos'd with blood [...] Of Thammuz yearly wounded: the Love-tale [...] Infected Sions daughters with like heat, [...] Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch [...] Ezekiel saw, when by the Vision led [...] His eye survay'd the dark Idolatries [...] Of alienated Judah. Next came one [...] Who mourn'd in earnest, when the Captive Ark [...] Maim'd his brute Image, head and hands lopt off [...] In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge, [...] 460 [...] Where he fell flat, and sham'd his Worshipers: [...] Dagon his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man [...] And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high [...] Rear'd in Azotus, dreaded through the Coast [...] Of Palestine, in Gath and Ascalon, [...] And Accaron and Gaza's frontier bounds. [...] Him follow'd Rimmon, whose delightful Seat [...] Was fair Damascus, on the fertil Banks [...] Of Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams. [...] He also against the house of God was bold: [...] 470 [...] A Leper once he lost and gain'd a King, [...] Ahaz his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew [...] Gods Altar to disparage and displace [...] For one of Syrian mode, whereon to burn [...] His odious offrings, and adore the Gods [...] Whom he had vanquisht. After these appear'd [...] A crew who under Names of old Renown, [...] Osiris, Isis, Orus and their Train [...] With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus'd [...] Fanatic Egypt and her Priests, to seek [...] 480 [...] Thir wandring Gods disguis'd in brutish forms [...] Rather then human. Nor did Israel scape [...] Th' infection when their borrow'd Gold compos'd [...] The Calf in Oreb: and the Rebel King [...] Doubl'd that sin in Bethel and in Dan, [...] Lik'ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox, [...] Jehovah, who in one Night when he pass'd [...] From Egypt marching, equal'd with one stroke [...] Both her first born and all her bleating Gods. [...] Belial came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd [...] 490 [...] Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love [...] Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood [...] Or Altar smoak'd; yet who more oft then hee [...] In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest [...] Turns Atheist, as did Ely's Sons, who fill'd [...] With lust and violence the house of God. [...] In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns [...] And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse [...] Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs, [...] And injury and outrage: And when Night [...] 500 [...] Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons [...] Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine. [...] Witness the Streets of Sodom, and that night [...] In Gibeah, when hospitable Dores [...] Yielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape. [...] These were the prime in order and in might; [...] The rest were long to tell, though far renown'd, [...] Th' Ionian Gods, of Javans Issue held [...] Gods, yet confest later then Heav'n and Earth [...] Thir boasted Parents; Titan Heav'ns first born [...] 510 [...] With his enormous brood, and birthright seis'd [...] By younger Saturn, he from mightier Jove [...] His own and Rhea's Son like measure found; [...] So Jove usurping reign'd: these first in Creet [...] And Ida known, thence on the Snowy top [...] Of cold Olympus rul'd the middle Air [...] Thir highest Heav'n; or on the Delphian Cliff, [...] Or in Dodona, and through all the bounds [...] Of Doric Land; or who with Saturn old [...] Fled over Adria to th' Hesperian Fields, [...] 520 [...] And ore the Celtic roam'd the utmost Isles. [...] All these and more came flocking; but with looks [...] Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear'd [...] Obscure som glimps of joy, to have found thir chief [...] Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost [...] In loss it self; which on his count'nance cast [...] Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride [...] Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore [...] Semblance of worth not substance, gently rais'd [...] Their fainted courage, and dispel'd their fears. [...] 530 [...] Then strait commands that at the warlike sound [...] Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard [...] His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim'd [...] Azazel as his right, a Cherube tall: [...] Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld [...] Th' Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc't [...] Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind [...] With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz'd, [...] Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while [...] Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds: [...] 540 [...] At which the universal Host upsent [...] A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond [...] Frighted the Reign of Chaos and old Night. [...] All in a moment through the gloom were seen [...] Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air [...] With Orient Colours waving: with them rose [...] A Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms [...] Appear'd, and serried Shields in thick array [...] Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move [...] In perfect Phalanx to the Dorian mood [...] 550 [...] Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais'd [...] To highth of noblest temper Hero's old [...] Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage [...] Deliberate valour breath'd, firm and unmov'd [...] With dread of death to flight or foul retreat, [...] Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage [...] With solemn touches, troubl'd thoughts, and chase [...] Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain [...] From mortal or immortal minds. Thus they [...] Breathing united force with fixed thought [...] 560 [...] Mov'd on in silence to soft Pipes that charm'd [...] Thir painful steps o're the burnt soyle; and now [...] Advanc't in view they stand, a horrid Front [...] Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise [...] Of Warriers old with order'd Spear and Shield, [...] Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief [...] Had to impose: He through the armed Files [...] Darts his experienc't eye, and soon traverse [...] The whole Battalion views, thir order due, [...] Thir visages and stature as of Gods, [...] 570 [...] Thir number last he summs. And now his heart [...] Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength [...] Glories: For never since created man, [...] Met such imbodied force, as nam'd with these [...] Could merit more then that small infantry [...] Warr'd on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood [...] Of Phlegra with th' Heroic Race were joyn'd [...] That fought at Theb's and Ilium, on each side [...] Mixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds [...] In Fable or Romance of Uthers Son [...] 580 [...] Begirt with British and Armoric Knights; [...] And all who since, Baptiz'd or Infidel [...] Jousted in Aspramont or Montalban, [...] Damasco, or Marocco, or Trebisond, [...] Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore [...] When Charlemain with all his Peerage fell [...] By Fontarabbia. Thus far these beyond [...] Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ'd [...] Thir dread Commander: he above the rest [...] In shape and gesture proudly eminent [...] 590 [...] Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost [...] All her Original brightness, nor appear'd [...] Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th' excess [...] Of Glory obscur'd: As when the Sun new ris'n [...] Looks through the Horizontal misty Air [...] Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon [...] In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds [...] On half the Nations, and with fear of change [...] Perplexes Monarchs. Dark'n'd so, yet shon [...] Above them all th' Arch Angel: but his face [...] 600 [...] Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care [...] Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes [...] Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride [...] Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast [...] Signs of remorse and passion to behold [...] The fellows of his crime, the followers rather [...] (Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn'd [...] For ever now to have their lot in pain, [...] Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc't [...] Of Heav'n, and from Eternal Splendors flung [...] 610 [...] For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood, [...] Thir Glory witherd. As when Heavens Fire [...] Hath scath'd the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines, [...] With singed top their stately growth though bare [...] Stands on the blasted Heath. He now prepar'd [...] To speak; whereat their doubl'd Ranks they bend [...] From Wing to Wing, and half enclose him round [...] With all his Peers: attention held them mute. [...] Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spite of scorn, [...] Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last [...] 620 [...] Words interwove with sighs found out their way. [...] O Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers [...] Matchless, but with th' Almighty, and that strife [...] Was not inglorious, though th' event was dire, [...] As this place testifies, and this dire change [...] Hateful to utter: but what power of mind [...] Foreseeing or presaging, from the Depth [...] Of knowledge past or present, could have fear'd, [...] How such united force of Gods, how such [...] As stood like these, could ever know repulse? [...] 630 [...] For who can yet beleeve, though after loss, [...] That all these puissant Legions, whose exile [...] Hath emptied Heav'n, shall faile to re-ascend [...] Self-rais'd, and repossess their native seat. [...] For me, be witness all the Host of Heav'n, [...] If counsels different, or danger shun'd [...] By me, have lost our hopes. But he who reigns [...] Monarch in Heav'n, till then as one secure [...] Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute, [...] Consent or custome, and his Regal State [...] 640 [...] Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal'd, [...] Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall. [...] Henceforth his might we know, and know our own [...] So as not either to provoke, or dread [...] New warr, provok't; our better part remains [...] To work in close design, by fraud or guile [...] What force effected not: that he no less [...] At length from us may find, who overcomes [...] By force, hath overcome but half his foe. [...] Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife [...] 650 [...] There went a fame in Heav'n that he ere long [...] Intended to create, and therein plant [...] A generation, whom his choice regard [...] Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven: [...] Thither, if but to prie, shall be perhaps [...] Our first eruption, thither or elsewhere: [...] For this Infernal Pit shall never hold [...] Caelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th' Abysse [...] Long under darkness cover. But these thoughts [...] Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird, [...] 660 [...] For who can think Submission? Warr then, Warr [...] Open or understood must be resolv'd. [...] He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew [...] Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs [...] Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze [...] Far round illumin'd hell: highly they rag'd [...] Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arm's [...] Clash'd on their sounding shields the din of war, [...] Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heav'n. [...] There stood a Hill not far whose griesly top [...] 670 [...] Belch'd fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire [...] Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign [...] That in his womb was hid metallic Ore, [...] The work of Sulphur. Thither wing'd with speed [...] A numerous Brigad hasten'd. As when bands [...] Of Pioners with Spade and Pickaxe arm'd [...] Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field, [...] Or cast a Rampart. Mammon led them on, [...] Mammon, the least erected Spirit that fell [...] From heav'n, for ev'n in heav'n his looks and thoughts [...] 680 [...] Were always downward bent, admiring more [...] The riches of Heav'ns pavement, trod'n Gold, [...] Then aught divine or holy else enjoy'd [...] In vision beatific: by him first [...] Men also, and by his suggestion taught, [...] Ransack'd the Center, and with impious hands [...] Rifl'd the bowels of thir mother Earth [...] For Treasures better hid. Soon had his crew [...] Op'nd into the Hill a spacious wound [...] And dig'd out ribs of Gold. Let none admire [...] 690 [...] That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best [...] Deserve the pretious bane. And here let those [...] Who boast in mortal things, and wondring tell [...] Of Babel, and the works of Memphian Kings, [...] Learn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame, [...] And Strength and Art are easily outdone [...] By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour [...] What in an age they with incessant toyle [...] And hands innumerable scarce perform [...] Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar'd, [...] 700 [...] That underneath had veins of liquid fire [...] Sluc'd from the Lake, a second multitude [...] With wondrous Art founded the massie Ore, [...] Severing each kinde, and scum'd the Bullion dross: [...] A third as soon had form'd within the ground [...] A various mould, and from the boyling cells [...] By strange conveyance fill'd each hollow nook, [...] As in an Organ from one blast of wind [...] To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths. [...] Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge [...] 710 [...] Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound [...] Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet, [...] Built like a Temple, where Pilasters round [...] Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid [...] With Golden Architrave; nor did there want [...] Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav'n, [...] The Roof was fretted Gold. Not Babilon, [...] Nor great Alcairo such magnificence [...] Equal'd in all thir glories, to inshrine [...] Belus or Serapis thir Gods, or seat [...] 720 [...] Thir Kings, when Aegypt with Assyria strove [...] In wealth and luxurie. Th' ascending pile [...] Stood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores [...] Op'ning thir brazen foulds discover wide [...] Within, her ample spaces, o're the smooth [...] And level pavement: from the arched roof [...] Pendant by suttle Magic many a row [...] Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed [...] With Naphtha and Asphaltus yeilded light [...] As from a sky. The hasty multitude [...] 730 [...] Admiring enter'd, and the work some praise [...] And some the Architect: his hand was known [...] In Heav'n by many a Towred structure high, [...] Where Scepter'd Angels held thir residence, [...] And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King [...] Exalted to such power, and gave to rule, [...] Each in his Herarchie, the Orders bright. [...] Nor was his name unheard or unador'd [...] In ancient Greece; and in Ausonian land [...] Men call'd him Mulciber; and how he fell [...] 740 [...] From Heav'n, they fabl'd, thrown by angry Jove [...] Sheer o're the Chrystal Battlements: from Morn [...] To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve, [...] A Summers day; and with the setting Sun [...] Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star, [...] On Lemnos th' Aegaean Ile: thus they relate, [...] Erring; for he with this rebellious rout [...] Fell long before; nor aught avail'd him now [...] To have built in Heav'n high Towrs; nor did he scape [...] By all his Engins, but was headlong sent [...] 750 [...] With his industrious crew to build in hell. [...] Mean while the winged Haralds by command [...] Of Sovran power, with awful Ceremony [...] And Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim [...] A solemn Councel forthwith to be held [...] At Pandaemonium, the high Capital [...] Of Satan and his Peers: thir summons call'd [...] From every and Band squared Regiment [...] By place or choice the worthiest; they anon [...] With hundreds and with thousands trooping came [...] 760 [...] Attended: all access was throng'd, the Gates [...] And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall [...] (Though like a cover'd field, where Champions bold [...] Wont ride in arm'd, and at the Soldans chair [...] Defi'd the best of Panim chivalry [...] To mortal combat or carreer with Lance) [...] Thick swarm'd, both on the ground and in the air, [...] Brusht with the hiss of russling wings. As Bees [...] In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides, [...] <b>Poure</b> forth thir populous youth about the Hive [...] 770 [...] In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers [...] Flie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank, [...] The suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel, [...] New rub'd with Baume, expatiate and confer [...] Thir State affairs. So thick the aerie crowd [...] Swarm'd and were straitn'd; till the Signal giv'n, [...] Behold a wonder! they but now who seemd [...] In bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons [...] Now less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room [...] Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race [...] 780 [...] Beyond the Indian Mount, or Faerie Elves, [...] Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side [...] Or Fountain fome belated Peasant sees, [...] Or dreams he sees, while over head the Moon [...] Sits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth [...] Wheels her pale course, they on thir mirth & dance [...] Intent, with jocond Music charm his ear; [...] At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds. [...] Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms [...] Reduc'd thir shapes immense, and were at large, [...] 790 [...] Though without number still amidst the Hall [...] Of that infernal Court. But far within [...] And in thir own dimensions like themselves [...] The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim [...] In close recess and secret conclave sat [...] A thousand Demy-Gods on golden seat's, [...] Frequent and full. After short silence then [...] And summons read, the great consult began.|$|E
30|$|By doping 10 % and 20 % of hexanol to CNSBD, smoke {{emission}} was reduced by 1.1 % and 1.4 %, respectively. This {{is caused by}} oxygen availability in hexanol which enhances the combustion rate and reduce formation of {{smoke emission}}s (Sundar and Saravanan 2011; De <b>Poures</b> et al. 2017).|$|R

This was due to increase in energy density of fuel mixtures by doping hexanol. In addition, it was also due to a reduction in viscosity of fuel with the addition of hexanol (Sundar and Saravanan 2011; De <b>Poures</b> et al. 2017). Fuel with lower viscosity assists the combustion process as it combines the fuel with air.|$|R
30|$|HC {{emissions}} {{increased with}} load {{for all the}} fuels. At higher loads, the mixture was too rich causing incomplete combustion and higher HC emission (Devarajan et al. 2016). HC emissions drop at all brake power by doping with hexanol. Increasing the hexanol content reduces the HC emissions significantly. This {{was caused by the}} lower viscosity of CNSBD by doping hexanol (Devarajan et al. 2017). The viscosity of CNSBD 900 H 100 and CNSBD 800 H 200 was reduced by 1.6 % and 1.8 %, respectively, comparing neat CNSBD. Due to lower viscosity, the mixing rate of fuel with air was drastically improved causing enhanced combustion and lower HC emission (Venkata Ramanan and Yuvarajan 2016). In addition, the vaporization of hexanol was faster which increased the pace of vaporization (De <b>Poures</b> et al. 2017; Sundar and Saravanan 2011).|$|R

[...] From hence, no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight, [...] Starr interpos'd, however small he sees, [...] Not unconform to other shining Globes, [...] Earth and the Gard'n of God, with Cedars crownd [...] 260 [...] Above all Hills. As when by night the Glass [...] Of Galileo, less assur'd, observes [...] Imagind Lands and Regions in the Moon: [...] Or Pilot from amidst the Cyclades [...] Delos or Samos first appeering kenns [...] A cloudy spot. Down thither prone in flight [...] He speeds, and through the vast Ethereal Skie [...] Sailes between worlds & worlds, with steddie wing [...] Now on the polar windes, then with quick Fann [...] Winnows the buxom Air; till within soare [...] 270 [...] Of Towring Eagles, to all the Fowles he seems [...] A Phoenix, gaz'd by all, as that sole Bird [...] When to enshrine his reliques in the Sun's [...] Bright Temple, to Aegyptian Theb's he flies. [...] At once on th' Eastern cliff of Paradise [...] He lights, and to his proper shape returns [...] A Seraph wingd; six wings he wore, to shade [...] His lineaments Divine; the pair that clad [...] Each shoulder broad, came mantling o're his brest [...] With regal Ornament; the middle pair [...] 280 [...] Girt like a Starrie Zone his waste, and round [...] Skirted his loines and thighes with downie Gold [...] And colours dipt in Heav'n; the third his feet [...] Shaddowd from either heele with featherd maile [...] Skie-tinctur'd grain. Like Maia's son he stood, [...] And shook his Plumes, that Heav'nly fragrance filld [...] The circuit wide. Strait knew him all the bands [...] Of Angels under watch; and to his state, [...] And to his message high in honour rise; [...] For on som message high they guessd him bound. [...] 290 [...] Thir glittering Tents he passd, and now is come [...] Into the blissful field, through Groves of Myrrhe, [...] And flouring Odours, Cassia, Nard, and Balme; [...] A Wilderness of sweets; for Nature here [...] Wantond as in her prime, and plaid at will [...] Her Virgin Fancies, pouring forth more sweet, [...] Wilde above rule or art; enormous bliss. [...] Him through the spicie Forrest onward com [...] Adam discernd, as in the dore he sat [...] Of his coole Bowre, while now the mounted Sun [...] 300 [...] Shot down direct his fervid Raies, to warme [...] Earths inmost womb, more warmth then Adam need; [...] And Eve within, due at her hour prepar'd [...] For dinner savourie fruits, of taste to please [...] True appetite, and not disrelish thirst [...] Of nectarous draughts between, from milkie stream, [...] Berrie or Grape: to whom thus Adam call'd. [...] Haste hither Eve, and worth thy sight behold [...] Eastward among those Trees, what glorious shape [...] Comes this way moving; seems another Morn [...] 310 [...] Ris'n on mid-noon; som great behest from Heav'n [...] To us perhaps he brings, and will voutsafe [...] This day to be our Guest. But goe with speed, [...] And what thy stores contain, bring forth and <b>poure</b> [...] Abundance, fit to honour and receive [...] Our Heav'nly stranger; well we may afford [...] Our givers thir own gifts, and large bestow [...] From large bestowd, where Nature multiplies [...] Her fertil growth, and by disburd'ning grows [...] More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare. [...] 320 [...] To whom thus Eve. Adam, earths hallowd mould, [...] Of God inspir'd, small store will serve, where store, [...] All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk; [...] Save what by frugal storing firmness gains [...] To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes: [...] But I will haste and from each bough and break, [...] Each Plant & juciest Gourd will pluck such choice [...] To entertain our Angel guest, as hee [...] Beholding shall confess that here on Earth [...] God hath dispenst his bounties as in Heav'n. [...] 330 [...] So saying, with dispatchful looks in haste [...] She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent [...] What choice to chuse for delicacie best, [...] What order, so contriv'd as not to mix [...] Tastes, not well joynd, inelegant, but bring [...] Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change, [...] Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk [...] Whatever Earth all-bearing Mother yeilds [...] In India East or West, or middle shoare [...] In Pontus or the Punic Coast, or where [...] 340 [...] Alcinous reign'd, fruit of all kindes, in coate, [...] Rough, or smooth rin'd, or bearded husk, or shell [...] She gathers, Tribute large, and on the board [...] Heaps with unsparing hand; for drink the Grape [...] She crushes, inoffensive moust, and meathes [...] From many a berrie, and from sweet kernels prest [...] She tempers dulcet creams, nor these to hold [...] Wants her fit vessels pure, then strews the ground [...] With Rose and Odours from the shrub unfum'd. [...] Mean while our Primitive great Sire, to meet [...] 350 [...] His god-like Guest, walks forth, without more train [...] Accompani'd then with his own compleat [...] Perfections, in himself was all his state, [...] More solemn then the tedious pomp that waits [...] On Princes, when thir rich Retinue long [...] Of Horses led, and Grooms besmeard with Gold [...] Dazles the croud, and sets them all agape. [...] Neerer his presence Adam though not awd, [...] Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek, [...] As to a superior Nature, bowing low, [...] 360 [...] Thus said. Native of Heav'n, for other place [...] None can then Heav'n such glorious shape contain; [...] Since by descending from the Thrones above, [...] Those happie places thou hast deignd a while [...] To want, and honour these, voutsafe with us [...] Two onely, who yet by sov'ran gift possess [...] This spacious ground, in yonder shadie Bowre [...] To rest, and what the Garden choicest bears [...] To sit and taste, till this meridian heat [...] Be over, and the Sun more coole decline. [...] 370 [...] Whom thus the Angelic Vertue answerd milde. [...] Adam, I therefore came, nor art thou such [...] Created, or such place hast here to dwell, [...] As may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heav'n [...] To visit thee; lead on then where thy Bowre [...] Oreshades; for these mid-hours, till Eevning rise [...] I have at will. So to the Silvan Lodge [...] They came, that like Pomona's Arbour smil'd [...] With flourets deck't and fragrant smells; but Eve [...] Undeckt, save with her self more lovely fair [...] 380 [...] Then Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feign'd [...] Of three that in Mount Ida naked strove, [...] Stood to entertain her guest from Heav'n; no vaile [...] Shee needed, Vertue-proof, no thought infirme [...] Alterd her cheek. On whom the Angel Haile [...] Bestowd, the holy salutation us'd [...] Long after to blest Marie, second Eve. [...] Haile Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful Womb [...] Shall fill the World more numerous with thy Sons [...] Then with these various fruits the Trees of God [...] 390 [...] Have heap'd this Table. Rais'd of grassie terf [...] Thir Table was, and mossie seats had round, [...] And on her ample Square from side to side [...] All Autumn pil'd, though Spring and Autumn here [...] Danc'd hand in hand. A while discourse they hold; [...] No fear lest Dinner coole; when thus began [...] Our Authour. Heav'nly stranger, please to taste [...] These bounties which our Nourisher, from whom [...] All perfet good unmeasur'd out, descends, [...] To us for food and for delight hath caus'd [...] 400 [...] The Earth to yeild; unsavourie food perhaps [...] To spiritual Natures; only this I know, [...] That one Celestial Father gives to all. [...] To whom the Angel. Therefore what he gives [...] (Whose praise be ever sung) to man in part [...] Spiritual, may of purest Spirits be found [...] No ingrateful food: and food alike those pure [...] Intelligential substances require [...] As doth your Rational; and both contain [...] Within them every lower facultie [...] 410 [...] Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste, [...] Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate, [...] And corporeal to incorporeal turn. [...] For know, whatever was created, needs [...] To be sustaind and fed; of Elements [...] The grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea, [...] Earth and the Sea feed Air, the Air those Fires [...] Ethereal, and as lowest first the Moon; [...] Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurg'd [...] Vapours not yet into her substance turnd. [...] 420 [...] Nor doth the Moon no nourishment exhale [...] From her moist Continent to higher Orbes. [...] The Sun that light imparts to all, receives [...] From all his alimental recompence [...] In humid exhalations, and at Even [...] Sups with the Ocean: though in Heav'n the Trees [...] Of life ambrosial frutage bear, and vines [...] Yeild Nectar, though from off the boughs each Morn [...] We brush mellifluous Dewes, and find the ground [...] Cover'd with pearly grain: yet God hath here [...] 430 [...] Varied his bounty so with new delights, [...] As may compare with Heaven; and to taste [...] Think not I shall be nice. So down they sat, [...] And to thir viands fell, nor seemingly [...] The Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss [...] Of Theologians, but with keen dispatch [...] Of real hunger, and concoctive heate [...] To transubstantiate; what redounds, transpires [...] Through Spirits with ease; nor wonder; if by fire [...] Of sooty coal the Empiric Alchimist [...] 440 [...] Can turn, or holds it possible to turn [...] Metals of drossiest Ore to perfet Gold [...] As from the Mine. Mean while at Table Eve [...] Ministerd naked, and thir flowing cups [...] With pleasant liquors crown'd: O innocence [...] Deserving Paradise! if ever, then, [...] Then had the Sons of God excuse to have bin [...] Enamour'd at that sight; but in those hearts [...] Love unlibidinous reign'd, nor jealousie [...] Was understood, the injur'd Lovers Hell. [...] 450 [...] Thus when with meats & drinks they had suffic'd, [...] Not burd'nd Nature, sudden mind arose [...] In Adam, not to let th' occasion pass [...] Given him by this great Conference to know [...] Of things above his World, and of thir being [...] Who dwell in Heav'n, whose excellence he saw [...] Transcend his own so farr, whose radiant forms [...] Divine effulgence, whose high Power so far [...] Exceeded human, and his wary speech [...] Thus to th' Empyreal Minister he fram'd. [...] 460 [...] Inhabitant with God, now know I well [...] Thy favour, in this honour done to man, [...] Under whose lowly roof thou hast voutsaf't [...] To enter, and these earthly fruits to taste, [...] Food not of Angels, yet accepted so, [...] As that more willingly thou couldst not seem [...] At Heav'ns high feasts to have fed: yet what compare? [...] To whom the winged Hierarch repli'd. [...] O Adam, one Almightie is, from whom [...] All things proceed, and up to him return, [...] 470 [...] If not deprav'd from good, created all [...] Such to perfection, one first matter all, [...] Indu'd with various forms, various degrees [...] Of substance, and in things that live, of life; [...] But more refin'd, more spiritous, and pure, [...] As neerer to him plac't or neerer tending [...] Each in thir several active Sphears assignd, [...] Till body up to spirit work, in bounds [...] Proportiond to each kind. So from the root [...] Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves [...] 480 [...] More aerie, last the bright consummate floure [...] Spirits odorous breathes: flours and thir fruit [...] Mans nourishment, by gradual scale sublim'd [...] To vital Spirits aspire, to animal, [...] To intellectual, give both life and sense, [...] Fansie and understanding, whence the soule [...] Reason receives, and reason is her being, [...] Discursive, or Intuitive; discourse [...] Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours, [...] Differing but in degree, of kind the same. [...] 490 [...] Wonder not then, what God for you saw good [...] If I refuse not, but convert, as you, [...] To proper substance; time may come when men [...] With Angels may participate, and find [...] No inconvenient Diet, nor too light Fare: [...] And from these corporal nutriments perhaps [...] Your bodies may at last turn all to Spirit [...] Improv'd by tract of time, and wingd ascend [...] Ethereal, as wee, or may at choice [...] Here or in Heav'nly Paradises dwell; [...] 500 [...] If ye be found obedient, and retain [...] Unalterably firm his love entire [...] Whose progenie you are. Mean while enjoy [...] Your fill what happiness this happie state [...] Can comprehend, incapable of more. [...] To whom the Patriarch of mankind repli'd. [...] O favourable spirit, propitious guest, [...] Well hast thou taught the way that might direct [...] Our knowledge, and the scale of Nature set [...] From center to circumference, whereon [...] 510 [...] In contemplation of created things [...] By steps we may ascend to God. But say, [...] What meant that caution joind, If Ye Be Found [...] Obedient? can wee want obedience then [...] To him, or possibly his love desert [...] Who formd us from the dust, and plac'd us here [...] Full to the utmost measure of what bliss [...] Human desires can seek or apprehend? [...] To whom the Angel. Son of Heav'n and Earth, [...] Attend: That thou art happie, owe to God; [...] 520 [...] That thou continu'st such, owe to thy self, [...] That is, to thy obedience; therein stand. [...] This was that caution giv'n thee; be advis'd. [...] God made thee perfet, not immutable; [...] And good he made thee, but to persevere [...] He left it in thy power, ordaind thy will [...] By nature free, not over-rul'd by Fate [...] Inextricable, or strict necessity; [...] Our voluntarie service he requires, [...] Not our necessitated, such with him [...] 530 [...] Findes no acceptance, nor can find, for how [...] Can hearts, not free, be tri'd whether they serve [...] Willing or no, who will but what they must [...] By Destinie, and can no other choose? [...] My self and all th' Angelic Host that stand [...] In sight of God enthron'd, our happie state [...] Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds; [...] On other surety none; freely we serve. [...] Because wee freely love, as in our will [...] To love or not; in this we stand or fall: [...] 540 [...] And som are fall'n, to disobedience fall'n, [...] And so from Heav'n to deepest Hell; O fall [...] From what high state of bliss into what woe! [...] To whom our great Progenitor. Thy words [...] Attentive, and with more delighted eare [...] Divine instructer, I have heard, then when [...] Cherubic Songs by night from neighbouring Hills [...] Aereal Music send: nor knew I not [...] To be both will and deed created free; [...] Yet that we never shall forget to love [...] 550 [...] Our maker, and obey him whose command [...] Single, is yet so just, my constant thoughts [...] Assur'd me and still assure: though what thou tellst [...] Hath past in Heav'n, som doubt within me move, [...] But more desire to hear, if thou consent, [...] The full relation, which must needs be strange, [...] Worthy of Sacred silence to be heard; [...] And we have yet large day, for scarce the Sun [...] Hath finisht half his journey, and scarce begins [...] His other half in the great Zone of Heav'n. [...] 560 [...] Thus Adam made request, and Raphael [...] After short pause assenting, thus began. [...] High matter thou injoinst me, O prime of men, [...] Sad task and hard, for how shall I relate [...] To human sense th' invisible exploits [...] Of warring Spirits; how without remorse [...] The ruin of so many glorious once [...] And perfet while they stood; how last unfould [...] The secrets of another world, perhaps [...] Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good [...] 570 [...] This is dispenc't, and what surmounts the reach [...] Of human sense, I shall delineate so, [...] By lik'ning spiritual to corporal forms, [...] As may express them best, though what if Earth [...] Be but the shaddow of Heav'n, and things therein [...] Each to other like, more then on earth is thought? [...] As yet this world was not, and Chaos wilde [...] Reignd where these Heav'ns now rowl, where Earth now rests [...] Upon her Center pois'd, when on a day [...] (For Time, though in Eternitie, appli'd [...] 580 [...] To motion, measures all things durable [...] By present, past, and future) on such day [...] As Heav'ns great Year brings forth, th' Empyreal Host [...] Of Angels by Imperial summons call'd, [...] Innumerable before th' Almighties Throne [...] Forthwith from all the ends of Heav'n appeerd [...] Under thir Hierarchs in orders bright [...] Ten thousand thousand Ensignes high advanc'd, [...] Standards, and Gonfalons twixt Van and Reare [...] Streame in the Aire, and for distinction serve [...] 590 [...] Of Hierarchies, of Orders, and Degrees; [...] Or in thir glittering Tissues bear imblaz'd [...] Holy Memorials, acts of Zeale and Love [...] Recorded eminent. Thus when in Orbes [...] Of circuit inexpressible they stood, [...] Orb within Orb, the Father infinite, [...] By whom in bliss imbosom'd sat the Son, [...] Amidst as from a flaming Mount, whose top [...] Brightness had made invisible, thus spake. [...] Hear all ye Angels, Progenie of Light, [...] 600 [...] Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers, [...] Hear my Decree, which unrevok't shall stand. [...] This day I have begot whom I declare [...] My onely Son, and on this holy Hill [...] Him have anointed, whom ye now behold [...] At my right hand; your Head I him appoint; [...] And by my Self have sworn to him shall bow [...] All knees in Heav'n, and shall confess him Lord: [...] Under his great Vice-gerent Reign abide [...] United as one individual Soule [...] 610 [...] For ever happie: him who disobeyes [...] Mee disobeyes, breaks union, and that day [...] Cast out from God and blessed vision, falls [...] Into utter darkness, deep ingulft, his place [...] Ordaind without redemption, without end. [...] So spake th' Omnipotent, and with his words [...] All seemd well pleas'd, all seem'd, but were not all. [...] That day, as other solem dayes, they spent [...] In song and dance about the sacred Hill, [...] Mystical dance, which yonder starrie Spheare [...] 620 [...] Of Planets and of fixt in all her Wheeles [...] Resembles nearest, mazes intricate, [...] Eccentric, intervolv'd, yet regular [...] Then most, when most irregular they seem: [...] And in thir motions harmonie Divine [...] So smooths her charming tones, that Gods own ear [...] Listens delighted. Eevning approachd [...] (For we have also our Eevning and our Morn, [...] We ours for change delectable, not need) [...] Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn [...] 630 [...] Desirous, all in Circles as they stood, [...] Tables are set, and on a sudden pil'd [...] With Angels Food, and rubied Nectar flows: [...] In Pearl, in Diamond, and massie Gold, [...] Fruit of delicious Vines, the growth of Heav'n. [...] They eat, they drink, and with refection sweet [...] Are fill'd, before th' all bounteous King, who showrd [...] With copious hand, rejoycing in thir joy. [...] Now when ambrosial Night with Clouds exhal'd [...] From that high mount of God, whence light & shade [...] 640 [...] Spring both, the face of brightest Heav'n had changd [...] To grateful Twilight (for Night comes not there [...] In darker veile) and roseat Dews dispos'd [...] All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest, [...] Wide over all the Plain, and wider farr [...] Then all this globous Earth in Plain outspred, [...] (Such are the Courts of God) Th' Angelic throng [...] Disperst in Bands and Files thir Camp extend [...] By living Streams among the Trees of Life, [...] Pavilions numberless, and sudden reard, [...] 650 [...] Celestial Tabernacles, where they slept [...] Fannd with coole Winds, save those who in thir course [...] Melodious Hymns about the sovran Throne [...] Alternate all night long: but not so wak'd [...] Satan, so call him now, his former name [...] Is heard no more Heav'n; he of the first, [...] If not the first Arch-Angel, great in Power, [...] In favour and praeeminence, yet fraught [...] With envie against the Son of God, that day [...] Honourd by his great Father, and proclaimd [...] 660 [...] Messiah King anointed, could not beare [...] Through pride that sight, and thought himself impaird. [...] Deep malice thence conceiving & disdain, [...] Soon as midnight brought on the duskie houre [...] Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolv'd [...] With all his Legions to dislodge, and leave [...] Unworshipt, unobey'd the Throne supream [...] Contemptuous, and his next subordinate [...] Awak'ning, thus to him in secret spake. [...] Sleepst thou Companion dear, what sleep can close [...] 670 [...] Thy eye-lids? and remembrest what Decree [...] Of yesterday, so late hath past the lips [...] Of Heav'ns Almightie. Thou to me thy thoughts [...] Wast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart; [...] Both waking we were one; how then can now [...] Thy sleep dissent? new Laws thou seest impos'd; [...] New Laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise [...] In us who serve, new Counsels, to debate [...] What doubtful may ensue, more in this place [...] To utter is not safe. Assemble thou [...] 680 [...] Of all those Myriads which we lead the chief; [...] Tell them that by command, ere yet dim Night [...] Her shadowie Cloud withdraws, I am to haste, [...] And all who under me thir Banners wave, [...] Homeward with flying march where we possess [...] The Quarters of the North, there to prepare [...] Fit entertainment to receive our King [...] The great Messiah, and his new commands, [...] Who speedily through all the Hierarchies [...] Intends to pass triumphant, and give Laws. [...] 690 [...] So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infus'd [...] Bad influence into th' unwarie brest [...] Of his Associate; hee together calls, [...] Or several one by one, the Regent Powers, [...] Under him Regent, tells, as he was taught, [...] That the most High commanding, now ere Night, [...] Now ere dim Night had disincumberd Heav'n, [...] The great Hierarchal Standard was to move; [...] Tells the suggested cause, and casts between [...] Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound [...] 700 [...] Or taint integritie; but all obey'd [...] The wonted signal, and superior voice [...] Of thir great Potentate; for great indeed [...] His name, and high was his degree in Heav'n; [...] His count'nance, as the Morning Starr that guides [...] The starrie flock, allur'd them, and with lyes [...] Drew after him the third part of Heav'ns Host: [...] Mean while th' Eternal eye, whose sight discernes [...] Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy Mount [...] And from within the golden Lamps that burne [...] 710 [...] Nightly before him, saw without thir light [...] Rebellion rising, saw in whom, how spred [...] Among the sons of Morn, what multitudes [...] Were banded to oppose his high Decree; [...] And smiling to his onely Son thus said. [...] Son, thou in whom my glory I behold [...] In full resplendence, Heir of all my might, [...] Neerly it now concernes us to be sure [...] Of our Omnipotence, and with what Arms [...] We mean to hold what anciently we claim [...] 720 [...] Of Deitie or Empire, such a foe [...] Is rising, who intends to erect his Throne [...] Equal to ours, throughout the spacious North; [...] Nor so content, hath in his thought to trie [...] In battel, what our Power is, or our right. [...] Let us advise, and to this hazard draw [...] With speed what force is left, and all imploy [...] In our defence, lest unawares we lose [...] This our high place, our Sanctuarie, our Hill. [...] To whom the Son with calm aspect and cleer [...] 730 [...] Light'ning Divine, ineffable, serene, [...] Made answer. Mightie Father, thou thy foes [...] Justly hast in derision, and secure [...] Laugh'st at thir vain designes and tumults vain, [...] Matter to mee of Glory, whom thir hate [...] Illustrates, when they see all Regal Power [...] Giv'n me to quell thir pride, and in event [...] Know whether I be dextrous to subdue [...] Thy Rebels, or be found the worst in Heav'n. [...] So spake the Son, but Satan with his Powers [...] 740 [...] Farr was advanc't on winged speed, an Host [...] Innumerable as the Starrs of Night, [...] Or Starrs of Morning, Dew-drops, which the Sun [...] Impearls on every leaf and every flouer. [...] Regions they pass'd, the mightie Regencies [...] Of Seraphim and Potentates and Thrones [...] In thir triple Degrees, Regions to which [...] All thy Dominion, Adam, is no more [...] Then what this Garden is to all the Earth, [...] And all the Sea, from one entire globose [...] 750 [...] Stretcht into Longitude; which having pass'd [...] At length into the limits of the North [...] They came, and Satan to his Royal seat [...] High on a Hill, far blazing, as a Mount [...] Rais'd on a Mount, with Pyramids and Towrs [...] From Diamond Quarries hew'n, & Rocks of Gold, [...] The Palace of great Lucifer, (so call [...] That Structure in the Dialect of men [...] Interpreted) which not long after, hee [...] Affecting all equality with God, [...] 760 [...] In imitation of that Mount whereon [...] Messiah was declar'd in sight of Heav'n, [...] The Mountain of the Congregation call'd; [...] For thither he assembl'd all his Train, [...] Pretending so commanded to consult [...] About the great reception of thir King, [...] Thither to come, and with calumnious Art [...] Of counterfeted truth thus held thir ears. [...] Thrones, Dominations, Princedomes, Vertues, Powers, [...] If these magnific Titles yet remain [...] 770 [...] Not meerly titular, since by Decree [...] Another now hath to himself ingross't [...] All Power, and us eclipst under the name [...] Of King anointed, for whom all this haste [...] Of midnight march, and hurried meeting here, [...] This onely to consult how we may best [...] With what may be devis'd of honours new [...] Receive him coming to receive from us [...] Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile, [...] Too much to one, but double how endur'd, [...] 780 [...] To one and to his image now proclaim'd? [...] But what if better counsels might erect [...] Our minds and teach us to cast off this Yoke? [...] Will ye submit your necks, and chuse to bend [...] The supple knee? ye will not, if I trust [...] To know ye right, or if ye know your selves [...] Natives and Sons of Heav'n possest before [...] By none, and if not equal all, yet free, [...] Equally free; for Orders and Degrees [...] Jarr not with liberty, but well consist. [...] 790 [...] Who can in reason then or right assume [...] Monarchie over such as live by right [...] His equals, if in power and splendor less, [...] In freedome equal? or can introduce [...] Law and Edict on us, who without law [...] Erre not, much less for this to be our Lord, [...] And look for adoration to th' abuse [...] Of those Imperial Titles which assert [...] Our being ordain'd to govern, not to serve? [...] Thus farr his bold discourse without controule [...] 800 [...] Had audience, when among the Seraphim [...] Abdiel, then whom none with more zeale ador'd [...] The Deitie, and divine commands obei'd, [...] Stood up, and in a flame of zeale severe [...] The current of his fury thus oppos'd. [...] O argument blasphemous, false and proud! [...] Words which no eare ever to hear in Heav'n [...] Expected, least of all from thee, ingrate [...] In place thy self so high above thy Peeres. [...] Canst thou with impious obloquie condemne [...] 810 [...] The just Decree of God, pronounc't and sworn, [...] That to his only Son by right endu'd [...] With Regal Scepter, every Soule in Heav'n [...] Shall bend the knee, and in that honour due [...] Confess him rightful King? unjust thou saist [...] Flatly unjust, to binde with Laws the free, [...] And equal over equals to let Reigne, [...] One over all with unsucceeded power. [...] Shalt thou give Law to God, shalt thou dispute [...] With him the points of libertie, who made [...] 820 [...] Thee what thou art, & formd the Pow'rs of Heav'n [...] Such as he pleasd, and circumscrib'd thir being? [...] Yet by experience taught we know how good, [...] And of our good, and of our dignitie [...] How provident he is, how farr from thought [...] To make us less, bent rather to exalt [...] Our happie state under one Head more neer [...] United. But to grant it thee unjust, [...] That equal over equals Monarch Reigne: [...] Thy self though great & glorious dost thou count, [...] 830 [...] Or all Angelic Nature joind in one, [...] Equal to him begotten Son, by whom [...] As by his Word the mighty Father made [...] All things, ev'n thee, and all the Spirits of Heav'n [...] By him created in thir bright degrees, [...] Crownd them with Glory, & to thir Glory nam'd [...] Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers [...] Essential Powers, nor by his Reign obscur'd, [...] But more illustrious made, since he the Head [...] One of our number thus reduc't becomes, [...] 840 [...] His Laws our Laws, all honour to him done [...] Returns our own. Cease then this impious rage, [...] And tempt not these; but hast'n to appease [...] Th' incensed Father, and th' incensed Son, [...] While Pardon may be found in time besought. [...] So spake the fervent Angel, but his zeale [...] None seconded, as out of season judg'd, [...] Or singular and rash, whereat rejoic'd [...] Th' Apostat, and more haughty thus repli'd. [...] That we were formd then saist thou? & the work [...] 850 [...] Of secondarie hands, by task transferd [...] From Father to his Son? strange point and new! [...] Doctrin which we would know whence learnt: who saw [...] When this creation was? rememberst thou [...] Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being? [...] We know no time when we were not as now; [...] Know none before us, self-begot, self-rais'd [...] By our own quick'ning power, when fatal course [...] Had circl'd his full Orbe, the birth mature [...] Of this our native Heav'n, Ethereal Sons. [...] 860 [...] Our puissance is our own, our own right hand [...] Shall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try [...] Who is our equal: then thou shalt behold [...] Whether by supplication we intend [...] Address, and to begirt th' Almighty Throne [...] Beseeching or besieging. This report, [...] These tidings carrie to th' anointed King; [...] And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight. [...] He said, and as the sound of waters deep [...] Hoarce murmur echo'd to his words applause [...] 870 [...] Through the infinite Host, nor less for that [...] The flaming Seraph fearless, though alone [...] Encompass'd round with foes, thus answerd bold. [...] O alienate from God, O spirit accurst, [...] Forsak'n of all good; I see thy fall [...] Determind, and thy hapless crew involv'd [...] In this perfidious fraud, contagion spred [...] Both of thy crime and punishment: henceforth [...] No more be troubl'd how to quit the yoke [...] Of Gods Messiah; those indulgent Laws [...] 880 [...] Will not be now voutsaf't, other Decrees [...] Against thee are gon forth without recall; [...] That Golden Scepter which thou didst reject [...] Is now an Iron Rod to bruise and breake [...] Thy disobedience. Well thou didst advise, [...] Yet not for thy advise or threats I fly [...] These wicked Tents devoted, least the wrauth [...] Impendent, raging into sudden flame [...] Distinguish not: for soon expect to feel [...] His Thunder on thy head, devouring fire.

3000|$|NO x [...] {{emissions}} {{increase with}} a load for all test fuels. At higher loads, the temperature attained by the combustion chamber will be high causing higher NO x [...] emissions (Yuvarajan and Venkata Ramanan 2016 c). Further, at higher loads, richer fuel mixture is supplied. By doping 10 % and 20 % of hexanol to CNSBD, the NO x [...] emissions were reduced by 3.1 % and 4.7 %. This {{is because of}} lower cylinder temperature attained by these blends {{as a result of}} the higher latent heat of vaporization and lower calorific value of hexanol in CNSBD. Further, it is also due to reduced viscosity of the hexanol and biodiesel blends. Lower viscosity of CNSBD and hexanol blend aids better atomization of fuel droplets and generates higher dispersion rate leading to improved combustion rate (lower ignition delay) and thereby reducing the temperature in the combustion chamber (Sundar and Saravanan 2011; De <b>Poures</b> et al. 2017).|$|R
5000|$|The {{issue of}} {{identity}} becomes particularly clear in an artwork of the Palestinian artist Raafat Hattab from Jaffa. The video performance [...] "untitled" [...] {{was part of}} the exhibition [...] "Men in the Sun" [...] in the Herzliya Museum of Contemporary Art in 2009. In the work, Raafat Hattab is seen as he <b>poures</b> water into a bucket in order to lengthily water an olive tree which is a sign for the lost paradise before 1948. The scene is primed by the song Hob (Love) by the Lebanese Ahmad Kaabour which expresses the need for Palestinian solidarity. The chorus repeats the phrase [...] "I left a place" [...] and {{it seems as if the}} video is dealing with memory. But as the camera zooms out, the spectator realizes that Hattab and the olive tree both actually stand in the middle of the Rabin Square, a main place in Tel Aviv, and the water used for watering the tree comes from the nearby fountain."In my installations I appear in different identities that combined are my identity — a Palestinian minority in Israel and a queer minority in the Palestinian culture", explains Rafaat Hattab in an interview with the Tel Avivian City Mouse Magazine.|$|R

50|$|During the American Revolution, {{the local}} European population, who were {{primarily}} American colonists that supported independence, rebelled against Britain. The British, {{with the help}} of local tribes, continually attacked American settlements in the region starting in 1776 and conquered Detroit. In 1781, Spanish raiders led by a French Captain Eugene <b>Poure</b> travelled by river and overland from St Louis, liberated British-held Fort St Joseph, and handed authority over the settlement to the Americans the following day. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783, and Michigan passed into the control of the newly formed United States of America. The states of New York, Virginia, Massachusetts then Connecticut ceded their territorial rights over the land. In 1787, the region became part of the Northwest Territory. The majority of Indians did not recognize the new government and instead formed the Western Confederacy. General Anthony Wayne with his Kentucky marksmen won the Battle of Fallen Timbers which led to the end of hostilities and treaties recognizing federal government sovereignty. The British, however, continued to occupy Detroit and other fortifications. Under terms negotiated in the 1794 Jay Treaty, Britain withdrew from Detroit and Michilimackinac in 1796. Questions remained over the boundary for many years, and the United States did not have uncontested control of the Upper Peninsula and Drummond Island until 1818 and 1847, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Dikarya is a {{subkingdom}} of fungi {{that includes}} Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. The gene expression patterns of dikaryon are poorly understood. In this study, we bred a dikaryon DK 13 × 3 by mating monokaryons MK 13 and MK 3, which {{were from the}} basidiospores of Pleurotus ostreatus TD 300. Using RNA-Seq, we obtained the transcriptomes of the three strains. We found that the total transcript numbers in the transcriptomes of the three strains were all more than ten thousand, and the expression profile in DK 13 × 3 was more similar to MK 13 than MK 3. However, the genes involved in macromolecule utilization, cellular material synthesis, stress-resistance and signal transduction were much more up-regulated in the dikaryon than its constituent monokaryons. All possible modes of differential gene expression, when compared to constituent monokaryons, including the presence/absence variation, and additivity/nonadditivity gene expression in the dikaryon may contribute to heterosis. By sequencing the urease gene <b>poure</b> sequences and mRNA sequences, we identified the monoallelic expression of the <b>poure</b> gene in the dikaryon, and its transcript was from the parental monokaryon MK 13. Furthermore, we discovered RNA editing in the <b>poure</b> gene mRNA of the three strains. These {{results suggest that the}} gene expression patterns in dikaryons should be similar to that of diploids during vegetative growth...|$|E
