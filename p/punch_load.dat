40|$|The present work is {{introduced}} and {{is shown to}} be a logical extension of work by Chung and Swift, Ray and Berry, et al. The authors introduce the deep drawing process and analyze the stresses due to radial drawing (including friction), bending the sheet, un-bending the sheet, and die profile friction. From these stresses, an expression for the total <b>punch</b> <b>load</b> is developed. The authors also describe the experimental work in which determinations are made of the work hardening exponents, the anisotropic co-efficients, the friction coefficients, and the total <b>punch</b> <b>load.</b> The paper concludes by com-paring the numerical evaluation of the maximum <b>punch</b> <b>load</b> with that determined from experiments. The Concept of Formability IOBMABILITY can be denned as the ability of a metal to withstand a drawing operation without rupture, separation, or buckling. Two properties which have been shown to influence the formability are the work-hardening exponent (the n value) and the anisotropy coefficient (or R value).

40|$|The {{stainless}} steel bipolar plate has received much attention {{due to the}} cost of graphite bipolar plates. Since the micro-channel of bipolar plates plays the role of fuel flow field, electric connector and fuel sealing, an investigation of the deep drawing process for {{stainless steel}} micro-channel arrays is reported in this work. The updated Lagrangian formulation, degenerated shell finite element analysis, and the r-minimum rule have been employed to study the relationship between <b>punch</b> <b>load</b> and stroke, distributions of stress and strain, thickness variations and depth variations of individual micro-channel sections. A micro-channel array is practically formed, with a width and depth of a single micro-channel of 0. 75 mm and 0. 5 mm, respectively. Fractures were usually observed in the fillet corner of the micro-channel bottom. According to the experimental results, more attention should be devoted to the fillet dimension design of punch and die. A larger die fillet can lead to better formability and a reduction of the <b>punch</b> <b>load.</b> In addition, the micro-channel thickness and the fillet radius have to be taken into consideration at the same time. Finally, the <b>punch</b> <b>load</b> estimated by the unmodified metal forming equation is higher than that of experiments...|$|E
40|$|This study, with {{experiments}} and comparisons, aims {{to analyze the}} difference of stainless (SUS 316 L) microtubes in the flaring forming among dies with various semicone angles (35 °, 40 °, 45 °, 50 °, and 55 °). The flow rule by Prandtl-Reuss combined with the finite element deformation theory and updated Lagrangian formulation (ULF) is applied to establish the finite element analysis equation for an incremental elastoplastic deformation to simulate the microtube flaring process. The broad rmin algorithm is utilized in the forming process for the elastoplastic state and die contact. The simulation data allow acquiring the deformation traceability, the relationship between <b>punch</b> <b>load</b> and punch stroke, the distribution of stress and strain, {{the distribution of the}} thinnest thickness resulted from dies with different semicone angles, and the distribution of flaring radius caused by dies with distinct semicone angles in the forming process. The experimental result presents similar results to the relationship between <b>punch</b> <b>load</b> and punch stroke and the simulation of the coefficient of friction μ= 0. 05, revealing the analysis being suitable for the analysis of microtube cone angle flaring process. The analysis and experimental results show that the thinnest thickness of the microtube increases with increasing semicone angles of dies and the maximal flaring radius of microtubes increases with increasing semicone angles of dies...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Punching {{portions}} of the sheet are sandwiched between the ceramic billets during rapid resistance heating to prevent hardening of these portions. When the heating temperature is locally {{lower than that of}} the austenitic transformation, i. e. below 800 ºC, this portion is not hardened without occurrence of martensitic transformation, and thus cold punching of hot-stamped parts becomes easy. The ceramic billets are made of alumina and the heat transfers to the billets. The temperature distribution just after resistance heating, the hardness distribution of the hot-stamped sheet, the cold <b>punching</b> <b>load,</b> the quality of the punched hole, etc. were measured. Hardening of punching portions was successfully prevented by sandwiching between the ceramic billets. The cold <b>punching</b> <b>load</b> for the local prevention of hardening was half of that without local prevention and the delayed fracture was also prevented, whereas the drop in hardness around the sheared edge became larger than that for laser cutting...|$|R

40|$|This study aims {{to clarify}} the process {{conditions}} of the V-die bending of a sheet metal of steel. It provides a model that predicts not only the correct <b>punch</b> <b>load</b> for bending, but also the precise final shape of products after unloading, based on the tensile properties of the material and the geometry of the tools used. An elasto-plastic incremental finite-element computer code, based on an updated Lagrangian formulation (ULF), was developed to simulate the V-die bending of sheet metal. In particular, selective reduced integration (SRI) was adopted to formulate the stiffness matrix. The extended r-minimum technique was used {{to deal with the}} elasto-plastic state and contact problems at the tool–metal interface. A series of experiments were performed to validate the formulation in the theory, leading {{to the development of the}} computer codes. The predicted value of the <b>punch</b> <b>load</b> in the finite-element model agrees closely with the results of the experiments. The whole deformation history and the distribution of stress and strain during the forming process were obtained by carefully considering the moving boundary condition in the finite-element method. A special feature of this V-die bending process is the camber after unloading. The computer program successfully simulates this camber. The simulation was performed to evaluate the effects of the size of the blank and the bending angle on camber process. The effects of all process variables on the final bending angle of the bent parts of the sheet after unloading were also evaluated.

40|$|AbstractBehavior of {{reinforced}} concrete slabs with composite patches under centric <b>punching</b> <b>load</b> {{is presented in}} this paper. An experimental investigation is being performed. The parameters considered are: the ratio of patch size {{and the nature of}} the composite. Several reports are considered to account for the strengthened specific area. The dimensions of the patches are calculated so that the ratio patch XP /YP is proportional to XD/ YD of the slab. Two types of composite CFRP and composite with cork fibers reinforcement are also considered in this study. The main objective is to evaluate the resistance of the concrete slabs reinforced by such composite patches and to define the parameters influencing the stiffness behavior. Using the Kinnunen and Nylander mechanism of rupture, an analytical model to predict the behavior of this type of tiles is proposed. An experimental investigation completed by theoretical modeling is carried out in order to assess the performances of the concrete slabs reinforced with composite patches under centric <b>punching</b> <b>load.</b> The average test and numerical results based on the finite element analysis in terms of overall and observed response are discussed and analyzed.

40|$|The small punch creep testing (SPCT) {{technique}} has received much attention {{because it can}} provide information on the creep behaviour of materials with a very small specimen being tested. However, {{the nature of the}} test is complex and several aspects of the behaviour of the specimen, characterised by various non-linear concurrent processes, still need investigation. This thesis reports the findings of experimental investigations and numerical analyses of SPCT carried out with the aim of improving the understanding of various features which characterise the behaviour of the specimen and to develop a novel technique to correlate the SPCT experimental output with the corresponding uniaxial creep test data, which is also presented. The experimental programme consisted of SPCTs and pre-strained uniaxial creep tests, all performed at 600 °C on the same batch of P 91 steel. The pre-strained uniaxial creep tests have been used to evaluate the effects of large initial plasticity on the subsequent creep behaviour of P 91 steel. For different stress levels, the results of the experiments have shown that creep was resisted for low pre-strain levels and enhanced for high pre-strains. The SPCT specimens have been investigated by use of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to identify the effects of the <b>punch</b> <b>load</b> on the fracture surface of the failed specimens and the evolution of microstructural features in the material during the test. When the <b>punch</b> <b>load</b> was increased, the failure mechanism changed from creep-governed to plasticity-governed, as the presence of fresh dimples in the fracture surface increased.

In this regards, several deep-drawing tests of cylindrical cups were conducted under four friction conditions at the tool–blank interface. The first case was the dry deep-drawing, considered as a reference friction condition, while in the other three cases hydraulic oil, lithium-based grease and animal fat were used as lubricants. For each friction case, three levels of blank holding force were adopted, namely 10, 20 and 25 kN.

Two different flow curves were used in the simulations; one displayed an initial flow-softening followed by perfect plastic behavior, whereas the other followed a constant flow-softening behavior. The flow-softening rate affects the intensity of shear localization. The deformation zone, that is usually concentrated around a fixed shear plane during processing of perfect plastic or strain hardening materials, splits into two parts and its position varies cyclically during the process, leading to oscillations in the <b>punch</b> <b>load</b> during processing.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation on}} model slabs {{and on a}} 1 / 3 scale composite bridge deck showed that the ultimate <b>punching</b> shear <b>load</b> depends on {{the shape of the}} loaded area, the compressive strength of concrete, the flexural reinforcement ratio and on the arrangement of steel bars. Punching failure follows the formation of an inclined failure surface {{from the edge of the}} loaded area to the opposite slab face running through the effective depth at a mean angle of 22 to 30 degrees. A study of the application of the yield line theory proves that flexure theory alone is not recommended to treat local failure because of the violent and nonductile nature of punching shear failure. An explanation of the application of the strut and tie model to symmetric punching shear is given to provide a base for future experimental programs and the development of this approach. The mechanism of symmetric punching of slabs without shear reinforcement is described based on observations from tests. An empirical equation to determine the ultimate <b>punching</b> <b>load</b> of flat slabs is proposed. It is concluded that the proposed equation can predict the ultimate <b>punching</b> shear <b>loads</b> of flat slabs with confidence similar to Kinnunen and Nylander's model.
