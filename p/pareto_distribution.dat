40|$|Abstract This paper proposes using {{collisions}} of Pareto randomvariables {{in traffic}} analysis and in generating fictitious network traffic that follows various <b>Pareto</b> <b>distributions.</b> <b>Pareto</b> <b>distributions</b> are {{commonly found in}} network statistics, but the distributions may be truncated or overlapping,thus {{making it hard to}} estimate their sample parameters. Thus, this paper investigates methods of computing param-eters of binned collisions of Pareto random variables...|$|R
25|$|The <b>Pareto</b> <b>distribution</b> is {{a special}} case of the {{generalized}} <b>Pareto</b> <b>distribution,</b> which is a family of distributions of similar form, but containing an extra parameter {{in such a way}} that the support of the distribution is either bounded below (at a variable point), or bounded both above and below (where both are variable), with the Lomax distribution as a special case. This family also contains both the unshifted and shifted exponential distributions.|$|E
25|$|Pareto {{distributions}} are continuous probability distributions. Zipf's law, {{also sometimes}} called the zeta distribution, may {{be thought of as}} a discrete counterpart of the <b>Pareto</b> <b>distribution.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>Pareto</b> <b>distribution,</b> {{named after}} the Italian civil engineer, economist, and {{sociologist}} Vilfredo Pareto, is a power law probability distribution that is used in description of social, scientific, geophysical, actuarial, and many other types of observable phenomena.|$|E
30|$|This {{model is}} {{typically}} {{referred to as}} the classical Pareto model. Improved fitting of data is encountered when more general Pareto-like distributions are considered. In this survey, the classical model will be embedded in a hierarchy of more complicated Pareto models. In this hierarchy of generalized <b>Pareto</b> <b>distributions,</b> the classical model will be called the <b>Pareto</b> (I) <b>distribution.</b> Multivariate income distributions are also of interest and, in that arena, a hierarchy of multivariate <b>Pareto</b> <b>distributions</b> is available, paralleling and closely related to the univariate hierarchy.|$|R

25|$|Note {{that the}} <b>Pareto</b> <b>distribution</b> and {{log-normal}} distribution are alternative distributions for describing {{the same types}} of quantities.

25|$|If {{data are}} {{represented}} by a statistical model specifying a particular family of probability distributions, then estimates of the median {{can be obtained by}} fitting that family of probability distributions to the data and calculating the theoretical median of the fitted distribution.

25|$|The normal {{distribution}} is a subclass of the elliptical distributions. The {{normal distribution}} is symmetric about its mean, and is non-zero {{over the entire}} real line.
