40|$|AbstractTo achieve {{national}} {{greenhouse gas}} {{reduction in the}} building sector, heating and cooling energy in buildings should be reduced. The government has strengthened regulations on insulation performance for building energy savings. However, the building envelope has various thermal bridges. In particular, a metal <b>panel</b> <b>curtain</b> wall comprises a number of thermal bridges at joints between the panels and the fixing units, thus degrading the overall thermal performance. To reduce building energy, {{it is necessary to}} reduce thermal bridges in building envelopes. This study aims to analyze the energy saving potential achieved by reducing thermal bridges. For this, the insulation performance and building energy needs of the existing and alternative metal <b>panel</b> <b>curtain</b> wall were evaluated. The alternative metal <b>panel</b> <b>curtain</b> wall that uses plastic molds at joints between panels and the thermally-broken brackets was suggested to reduce heat loss through thermal bridges. As results, the effective U-value of the alternative metal <b>panel</b> <b>curtain</b> wall was reduced by 72 % compared with the existing metal <b>panel</b> <b>curtain</b> wall. In addition, annual heating energy needs of the alternative metal <b>panel</b> <b>curtain</b> wall building was reduced by 26 %, and annual total energy needs was reduced by 6 % because annual cooling energy needs of it slightly increased compared with the existing metal <b>panel</b> <b>curtain</b> wall. In conclusion, the alternative metal <b>panel</b> <b>curtain</b> wall considerably influenced the savings in building energy needs by reducing thermal bridges...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Envelope {{designs of}} eighty-three {{commercial}} buildings completed in January and June during an 11 -year period (1982 - 1992) in Hong Kong have been surveyed. Four different building envelope types have been identified: reinforced concrete (RC) with tile cladding, precast concrete <b>panel,</b> <b>curtain</b> walls, and overclad-ding. RC with tile cladding is adopted for less expensive small development. Most large scale building projects {{tend to use}} curtain walls and overcladding. Precast con-crete panel is not very common and is used only when a strongly moulded facade is desired. To get some idea about energy efficiency in terms of limiting heat gain through the building envelope, the overall thermal transfer value (OTTV) has been analyzed, and implications for energy consumption are discussed.

40|$|AbstractIn many {{countries}} of Central Europe is a stock of existing buildings from 1950 's to 1980 's featuring original <b>panel</b> <b>curtain</b> walls. These envelope structures {{are now at}} the end of their service life and thus replacement solution is needed. There are various replacement alternatives such as aluminium, steel or steel-plastic panels, but these structures have typically high amounts of embodied energy and carbon footprint. Within national research project Intelligent Buildings, Czech Technical University in Prague has developed a timber-based curtain wall system called Envilop. The paper presents its development and laboratory testing. Properties of Envilop were proven by modeling, calculations and experiments inline with actual standards on curtain walls systems and in addition life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed. Heat and moisture simulations proved that does not suffer from thermal bridges and has U-values at levels suitable for passive housing; air tightness testing proved high quality of design. LCA calculations compared the system to aluminum-based alternative and show significant potential to savings in embodied energy and carbon footprint by using Envilop...|$|E

5000|$|Adding {{absorptive}} {{materials to}} the interior surfaces of rooms (e.g. fabric-faced fiberglass <b>panels,</b> thick <b>curtains)</b> {{will result in a}} decrease of reverberated sound energy within the room. However, absorptive interior surface treatments do not significantly improve the sound isolation from one room to another through demising partitions over the typical frequency range measured currently. Installing absorptive insulation (e.g., fiberglass batts, blow-in cellulose, mineral fiber batts) into the wall or ceiling cavities affects the sound isolation of the partition to varying degrees, depending on the framing configuration and joist or stud depth. For example, the presence of type of insulation in single 2x4 wood stud framing spaced 16" [...] (406 mm) on-center results in only a few STC points. In contrast, adding standard fiberglass insulation to an otherwise empty cavity in light-gauge (25-gauge or lighter) steel stud partitions can result in a nearly 10 STC-point improvement. As the stud gauge becomes heavier, the presence and type of insulation matters less.|$|R

The palette consisted of glauconite, celadonite, Egyptian blue, and red and yellow ochres. In some cases, an organic compound, possibly a lipidic compound, was present in the external paint layer, as a surface treatment. The plaster contains two superimposed coats: the render coat with lime binder and sandy aggregate; the finish coat with a clay fraction (illite, chlorite, kaolinite), together with calcite from slaked lime and grains of quartz, silicate and carbonate rocks. Although Vitrivius’ De architectura reported the use of creta (clay) as daub smeared on reed vaults, the Sanctuary of Brixia represents the first documented use in Roman buildings in a painted plaster laid on a stone masonry wall...|$|R

40|$|Today with rapid {{industrial}}ization, {{industrial noise}} {{has become a}} serious environmental problem in Sri Lanka. The noise which is generated by machines in industry is called as industrial noise. This excessive noise can interfere with communication between supervisors and employees. Continuous exposure to noise can cause fatigue, which often results in accidents and reduces the pace and quality of work. Noise affects negatively on the day today life of surrounding people, who have faced with many problems mentally and physically. Therefore, noise control {{is one of the}} major requirements to improve the living environment. Most of the developed countries use practical techniques to minimize the nuisance such as barrier walls, duct silencers, acoustical wall <b>panel,</b> soundproof <b>curtains,</b> sound enclosures for industrial machinery and other similar noise control treatments that are installed near the source to effectively reduce the sound level. However, Sri Lanka has not yet yielded much into this issue as noise reduction methods are costly. Therefore, it is necessary to find out cost effective methods to control industrial noise. This research was conducted to investigate the potential uses of Salvinia dust as natural sound reduction material, to give a solution for the existing industrial noise problems. Specimens having a size of 75 mm (diameter) x 25 mm (thickness) were made by using Salvinia dust. Salvinia dust was mixed with cement at a ratio of 1 : 1 and water was added. Noise Reduction Coefficient of these specimens were investigated by using an experimental set-up including signal generator, speaker and noise level meter. Noise reduction ability of the materials was quantified by using Noise Reduction Co-efficient (NRC). Variation of NRC with particle size, mix proportion and sample thickness were also investigated. Effectiveness of Salvinia dust to control industrial noise is discussed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of adding {{localised}} stiffness, via a spring support, on the stability of flexible panels subjected to axial uniform incompressible flow. Applications are considered that range from the hydro-elasticity of hull panels of high-speed ships to the aero-elasticity of glass <b>panels</b> in the <b>curtain</b> walls of high-rise buildings in very strong winds. A two-dimensional linear analysis is conducted using a hybrid of theoretical and computational methods that calculates the system eigen-states but {{can also be used to}} capture the transient behaviour that precedes these. We show that localised stiffening is a very effective means to increase the divergence-onset flow speed in both hydro- and aero-elastic applications. It is most effective when located at the mid-chord of the panel and there exists an optimum value of added stiffness beyond which further increases to the divergence-onset flow speed do not occur. For aero-elastic applications, localised stiffening can be used to replace the more destructive flutter instability that follows divergence at higher flow speeds by an extended range of divergence. The difference in eigen-solution morphology between aero- and hydro-elastic applications is highlighted, showing that for the former coalescence of two non-oscillatory divergence modes is the mechanism for flutter onset. This variation in solution morphology is mapped out in terms of a non-dimensional mass ratio. Finally, we present a short discussion of the applicability of the stabilisation strategy in a full three-dimensional system...|$|R

40|$|MOTINTERNATIONAL Brussels {{is delighted}} to present its first {{exhibition}} showing three young belgian artists Nel Aerts, Kasper Bosmans and Julien Meert. An Atlas: a book taking {{us back to}} childhood; leafing through pictures of travel, mysteries, and worlds unknown; operating as a large collage of images cut from photographs and documents; used to retrace history, boundaries, facts and beliefs. Atlas takes its title from Jorge Luis Borges’ 1986 book of the same name, in which, he compiled fragments and musings from his journal alongside material from poetry, literature, and images. Evoking cartography, Borges created a personal geography. It is precisely this idea of cartography, cherished by the writer, that gathers the three young Belgian artists presented at MOTINTERNATIONAL Brussels: Nel Aerts, Kasper Bosmans and Julien Meert. All three {{pay particular attention to}} line, shape and graphic outcome, sharing an interest in enduring, antique imagery and signs, alongside incisive engagement with popular culture. Julien Meert’s portraits explore precisely this boundary. Constructed from numerous layers of paint, the artist builds multiple surfaces, reflecting his search for perfect accordance within his images. Meert’s paintings result in intense, anonymous faces, which stare down the viewer with intimidating gazes. Nel Aerts similarly works with the idea of layers. However, while it is difficult to ascertain the laborious processes that produce Meert’s smooth, confident canvases, Aerts presents us with vibrant etched patterns. Covering both wooden <b>panels</b> and <b>curtains,</b> she scratches, chisels, pits, and sews to create motifs including raindrops or tears in her paintings and textiles. This decorative aspect of painting is also reflected in the work of Kasper Bosmans. With an intuitive and functional approach, he explores remnants of local traditions and mythological iconography, investigating the spaces between nature and fiction, art and craft. Through Bosmans’s singular observations of the world, the awkward presence of Aert’s tragicomic characters, and Meert’s fascination for inscrutable images of faces, a strange territory is built, in which the borders between refinement and everyday life are eroded.

40|$|This is {{the second}} update of a Cochrane Review {{originally}} published in 2009. Millions of workers worldwide are exposed to noise levels that increase their risk of hearing disorders. There is uncertainty {{about the effectiveness of}} hearing loss prevention interventions. To assess the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions for preventing occupational noise exposure or occupational hearing loss compared to no intervention or alternative interventions. We searched the CENTRAL; PubMed; Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; and OSH UPDATE to 3 October 2016. We included randomised controlled trials (RCT), controlled before-after studies (CBA) and interrupted time-series (ITS) of non-clinical interventions under field conditions among workers to prevent or reduce noise exposure and hearing loss. We also collected uncontrolled case studies of engineering controls about the effect on noise exposure. Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias and extracted data. We categorised interventions as engineering controls, administrative controls, personal hearing protection devices, and hearing surveillance. We included 29 studies. One study evaluated legislation to reduce noise exposure in a 12 -year time-series analysis but there were no controlled studies on engineering controls for noise exposure. Eleven studies with 3725 participants evaluated effects of personal hearing protection devices and 17 studies with 84, 028 participants evaluated effects of hearing loss prevention programmes (HLPPs). Effects on noise exposure Engineering interventions following legislationOne ITS study found that new legislation in the mining industry reduced the median personal noise exposure dose in underground coal mining by 27. 7 percentage points (95 % confidence interval (CI) - 36. 1 to - 19. 3 percentage points) immediately after the implementation of stricter legislation. This roughly translates to a 4. 5 dB(A) decrease in noise level. The intervention was associated with a favourable but statistically non-significant downward trend in time of the noise dose of - 2. 1 percentage points per year (95 % CI - 4. 9 to 0. 7, 4 year follow-up, very low-quality evidence). Engineering intervention case studiesWe found 12 studies that described 107 uncontrolled case studies of immediate reductions in noise levels of machinery ranging from 11. 1 to 19. 7 dB(A) as a result of purchasing new equipment, segregating noise sources or installing <b>panels</b> or <b>curtains</b> around sources. However, the studies lacked long-term follow-up and dose measurements of workers, and we did not use these studies for our conclusions. Hearing protection devicesIn general hearing protection devices reduced noise exposure on average by about 20 dB(A) in one RCT and three CBAs (57 participants, low-quality evidence). Two RCTs showed that, with instructions for insertion, the attenuation of noise by earplugs was 8. 59 dB better (95 % CI 6. 92 dB to 10. 25 dB) compared to no instruction (2 RCTs, 140 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Administrative controls: information and noise exposure feedbackOn-site training sessions did not have an effect on personal noise-exposure levels compared to information only in one cluster-RCT after four months' follow-up (mean difference (MD) 0. 14 dB; 95 % CI - 2. 66 to 2. 38). Another arm of the same study found that personal noise exposure information had no effect on noise levels (MD 0. 30 dB(A), 95 % CI - 2. 31 to 2. 91) compared to no such information (176 participants, low-quality evidence). Effects on hearing loss Hearing protection devicesIn two studies the authors compared the effect of different devices on temporary threshold shifts at short-term follow-up but reported insufficient data for analysis. In two CBA studies the authors found no difference in hearing loss from noise exposure above 89 dB(A) between muffs and earplugs at long-term follow-up (OR 0. 8, 95 % CI 0. 63 to 1. 03), very low-quality evidence). Authors of another CBA study found that wearing hearing protection more often resulted in less hearing loss at very long-term follow-up (very low-quality evidence). Combination of interventions: hearing loss prevention programmesOne cluster-RCT found no difference in hearing loss at three- or 16 -year follow-up between an intensive HLPP for agricultural students and audiometry only. One CBA study found no reduction of the rate of hearing loss (MD - 0. 82 dB per year (95 % CI - 1. 86 to 0. 22) for a HLPP that provided regular personal noise exposure information compared to a programme without this information. There was very-low-quality evidence in four very long-term studies, that better use of hearing protection devices as part of a HLPP decreased the risk of hearing loss compared to less well used hearing protection in HLPPs (OR 0. 40, 95 % CI 0. 23 to 0. 69). Other aspects of the HLPP such as training and education of workers or engineering controls did not show a similar effect. In three long-term CBA studies, workers in a HLPP had a statistically non-significant 1. 8 dB (95 % CI - 0. 6 to 4. 2) greater hearing loss at 4 kHz than non-exposed workers and the confidence interval includes the 4. 2 dB which is the level of hearing loss resulting from 5 years of exposure to 85 dB(A). In addition, of three other CBA studies that could not be included in the meta-analysis, two showed an increased risk of hearing loss in spite of the protection of a HLPP compared to non-exposed workers and one CBA did not. There is very low-quality evidence that implementation of stricter legislation can reduce noise levels in workplaces. Controlled studies of other engineering control interventions in the field have not been conducted. There is moderate-quality evidence that training of proper insertion of earplugs significantly reduces noise exposure at short-term follow-up but long-term follow-up is still needed. There is very low-quality evidence that the better use of hearing protection devices as part of HLPPs reduces the risk of hearing loss, whereas for other programme components of HLPPs we did not find such an effect. The absence of conclusive evidence should not be interpreted as evidence of lack of effectiveness. Rather, it means that further research is very likely to have an important impac...|$|R
