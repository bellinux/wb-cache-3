50|$|An {{alternative}} to <b>packaged</b> <b>systems</b> {{is the use}} of separate indoor and outdoor coils in split systems. These systems, although most often seen in residential applications, are gaining popularity in small commercial buildings. The evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor unit instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.|$|E
50|$|Midas {{became the}} {{standard}} package for banks off shore operations (and some domestic wholesale banking operations) worldwide {{by the end}} of the 1970s, and thanks to that early leadership it has been argued that Midas is (or was) the world's most successful banking system. In the 1970s and 1980s the Midas family of banking-packages led the market with more worldwide customers, more awards, and more capability than any other. Thanks to the inertia of banks, 10 year renewals and cost of migration by some accounts it could claim to have kept this leadership position into the 1990s. The system had broader functionality (and sometimes deeper) than most of the packages initially available on <b>packaged</b> <b>systems.</b> It reduced risks bringing efficiency due to a fairly standardised and comparatively automated process cycle.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of highly integrated electronic packages leads to {{increasing numbers of}} materials combinations and bi- material interfaces within packages. For the {{development of}} robust <b>packaged</b> <b>systems</b> a fundamental knowledge of reliability relevant material parameters is needed. Delamination in <b>packaged</b> <b>systems</b> causes subsequent cracking, e. g. of the encapsulants, and ultimately {{the failure of the}} electronic components. The characterisation of materials used for <b>packaged</b> <b>systems</b> requires numerous test methods. The correct approach to the lifetime models for interface is to apply fracture mechanics. This paper presents developments in newly designed testing methods for the analysis of bulk and interface properties derived from miniaturized test samples. The objective is to thereby enable lifetime prediction for typical failure modes. The new testing methods allow the analysis of delamination toughness with respect to the mode mixity (loading ratio mode I/ mode II). These test methods allow a large mode-angle range to obtain the critical energy release rate Gc() and high-throughput testing under different loading conditions (temperature, moisture). The image correlation technique was used for analysis of crack tip location at the interface. For the extraction of fracture parameters (e. g. energy release rate Gc() or stress intensity factor SIF) from these tests a finite element simulation is utilized...|$|E

40|$|The role of <b>packaging</b> <b>systems</b> {{to reduce}} food waste is rarely {{modelled}} in {{life cycle assessment}} (LCA) studies. This means that a <b>packaging</b> <b>system</b> format with a lower environmental impact that causes high food waste, {{may appear to be}} a better alternative than a <b>packaging</b> <b>system</b> with a higher environmental impact that reduces food waste. This can be contradictory to the purpose of using LCA to reduce overall environmental impacts, because food generally has a higher environmental impact than the <b>packaging</b> <b>system.</b> This paper highlights packaging attributes that may influence food waste, and demonstrates via six packaging scenarios how the environmental impact for the functional unit of "eaten food" can be calculated when food waste is included. The results show that the function of "avoiding food waste" is a critical packaging issue.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 10 years, the wet {{shotcrete}} method {{has become increasingly}} used in the repair of vertical and overhead concrete surfaces. This is due, in part, to advances in materials such as the introduction of silica fume (microsilica), fibers and super-plasticizers, which not only make shotcrete easier to place, but also improve its durability. Batching all these materials in the right proportions with sand and cement can be difficult, so many manufacturers have developed pre-packed shotcrete repair mortars to which contractors add only water. The pre-packed materials simplify batching and provide more consistent quality. But packaging all the dry materials increases their cost. Gemite Products Inc. Amherst, NY developed pre-packed products (called "concentrates"), which include all the admixtures but require contractors to provide their own sand and cement.

40|$|Abstract Background Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) -based gene delivery systems are {{popular due to}} their superior efficiency of transduction of primary cells. However, these systems cannot be readily used for delivery of anti-HIV- 1 genes that target constituents of the <b>packaging</b> <b>system</b> itself due to inimical effects on vector titer. Here we describe HIV- 1 -based <b>packaging</b> <b>systems</b> containing the Rev-response element (RRE), of simian {{immunodeficiency virus}} (SIV) {{in place of the}} HIV- 1 RRE. The SIV RRE-containing <b>packaging</b> <b>systems</b> were used to deliver the anti-Rev gene, Rev M 10, into HIV- 1 susceptible target cells. Results An HIV- 1 based <b>packaging</b> <b>system</b> was created using either a 272 - or 1045 -nucleotide long RRE derived from the molecular clone SIVmac 239. The 1045 -nucleotide SIV RRE-containing HIV- 1 <b>packaging</b> <b>system</b> provided titers comparable to that of the HIV- 1 RRE-based one. Moreover, despite the use of HIV- 1 Rev for production of vector stocks, this <b>packaging</b> <b>system</b> was found to be relatively refractory to the inhibitory effects of Rev M 10. Correspondingly, the SIV RRE-based <b>packaging</b> <b>system</b> provided 34 - to 130 -fold higher titers than the HIV- 1 RRE one when used for packaging a gene transfer vector encoding Rev-M 10. Jurkat T-cells, gene modified with Rev M 10 encoding HIV- 1 vectors, upon challenge with replication defective HIV- 1 in single-round infection experiments, showed diminished production of virus particles. Conclusion A simple modification of an HIV- 1 gene delivery system, namely, replacement of HIV- 1 RRE with that of SIV, allowed efficient delivery of Rev M 10 transgene into T-cell lines for intracellular immunization against HIV- 1 replication. </p...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{backpressure}} {{steam turbines}} to make low-cost electricity {{is a well}} established technology with a long and illustrious history and a value that became lost as industry switched from home-grown power generation to centralized utility power in the 30 's and 40 's. Cogeneration, once the normal and very efficient way of making power for most industries, cities, and even small towns, was left behind as utilities gradually moved toward large central station plants located far from city centers or industries {{that could serve as}} thermal loads. As a result, the average efficiency of electricity production dropped from 85 % to 35 % from 1935 to 1975. Now, however, the utility paradigm is changing again as deregulation spreads from state to state with its promise of more competition and better pricing for electricity users, and its accompanying proliferation of new rules and new players. In this environment, the value of a technology that allows industries and institutions to make cheap power as a function of their thermal load is re-emerging.

40|$|Because of {{its high}} {{volumetric}} heat capacity, CO 2 offers the potential for reduced weight and volume in <b>packaged</b> <b>systems,</b> which is a major focus for automobile and military applications. The review of present literature, however, {{has shown that the}} overall efficiency of the transcritical CO 2 cycle decreases as the weight and volume of the system are decreased. System improvements must be achieved to meet the goals of the reduction of weight and volume, while still retaining competitive efficiency. ^ A thermodynamic analysis was performed for several modified transcritical CO 2 cycles, with a goal of determining the proper configuration to achieve the optimum system performance. The analysis shows that the system efficiency of the transcritical CO 2 cycle can be dramatically increased by modifications of the system configuration, and that the optimum performance is a strong function of the operating conditions. ^ The system efficiency of the transcritical CO 2 cycle is increased considerably by nearly 100 % when the low-side pressure increases from 2. 5 MPa to 4. 5 MPa. There is a specific high-side pressure at which the maximum COP occurs in the CO 2 cycle. There are also specific pressure ratios across the compressors for the minimum compression work and the maximum COP for the two-compressor system. ^ The employment of a work extraction device in the role of an expander is expected to give the largest improvement of the system efficiency. This device will not only increase the heat removal capacity of the evaporator but also can reduce the compression work. As part of this research, an expansion device with output work (ED-WOW) was designed, constructed and installed in a prototype transcritical CO 2 refrigeration system, replacing the simple throttling valve. During cycle tests, the use of the device provided between 7 % and 10 % improvement in COP. These figures are considered to be highly conservative, as the work extraction measurement was biased toward a lower value due to uncertainty in the load device performance. ...|$|E
