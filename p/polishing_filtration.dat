Tricel was also awarded the allgemeine bauaufsichtliche Zulassung des DIBt, the German Certification to sell Tricel {{wastewater}} treatment systems in Germany.|$|E
40|$|As {{the surface}} {{finishing}} industry {{moves into the}} decade of the WS, the trend toward more stringent regulations is clear. The reduction of categorical limits is inevitable. To meet this environmental demand, polishing systems added to conventional treatment systems will become more commonplace. A case study is provided which details the retrofitting of a tertiary ion exchange system to a conventional alkalinechlorination heavy metal precipitation treatment system. The requirements to consistently remove metals from a plating effluent stream to the fractions of parts-permillion range demands an integrated system of <b>polishing</b> <b>filtration,</b> oxidant removal, and ion exchange. The system design, ~ operation, "learning experiences, " and system capabilities will be detailed. 1 24...|$|E
30|$|Powdered {{activated}} carbon waste (PACW) as a secondary product in some sugar factories {{attributed to the}} hydrothermal activation of the main granulated active carbon (GAC) after burning process in the kiln. By such pretreatment, a wet PACW biomass is dehydrated and used again. As requirements for hygiene and safety in sugar decolorization process, the decolorizing material should possess large surface area, good porosity and pH sensitivity for sugar colorants such as flavonoids and phenolic structures (Singh et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2012). Moreover, during processing, especially after <b>polishing</b> <b>filtration,</b> the sugar mud juice (SMJ) was obtained {{which is a very}} complicated sludge (high color, bad odor, high viscosity, high brix, etc.), and this is our noble target for decreasing the color as much as possible. There are physical and chemical treatments for dealing with PAC, but the thermal and chemical activation methods are the most predominant techniques for regeneration of exhausted PAC (Gupta et al. 2009; Lu et al. 2011; Guo et al. 2011; Lim and Okada 2005; Simaratanamongkol and Thiravetyan 2010). Thus, the temperature was raised up to 600  °C in the thermal activation process (Martin and Ng 1984). Color removal from SMJ considered new tools and new idea to decrease color of non-sugar compounds such as betaine and phenolic substances. In this respect, a practical and economic way to add value to the waste carbon in sugar factory is deeply required.|$|E
40|$|A one-year {{record of}} {{airborne}} microorganisms {{content in the}} region of the seaside resort in Sopot and in a few locations along the coastline of the Gulf of Gdansk are presented. The air samples were collected by means of filtration method using an apparatus produced by Sartorius. In addition, several investigations were performed to compare the results of three sampling methods: sedimentation method according to <b>Polish</b> Regulation [1], <b>filtration,</b> and impaction. The total number of mesophilic, psychrophilic bacteria and fungi concentrations in air were determined. Between January and December 1998 the number of mesophilic bacteria in air varied from a few to 308 CFU/m 3 (CFU-Colony Forming Units), while the number of psychrophilic bacteria varied from 1 to 190 CFU/m 3. The respective fungi content varied from 5 to 1100 CFU/m 3. The monthly and seasonal geometrical mean values were calculated showing that the maximum seasonal occurrence of studied groups of microor-ganisms were observed at different times...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of recombinant therapeutic proteins {{is becoming increasingly}} important as demand rises and the industry reaches its production capacity. Transgenic plants offer an alternative production system to the established platforms, but this requires the development of downstream processing schemes tailored for both the platform and the product. The aim of this thesis, within the EU-funded project Pharma-Planta, was to develop and optimize downstream processing strategies for the purification of the recombinant anti-HIV antibody 2 G 12. Different techniques were successfully combined into a process strategy to fulfill this objective. Clinical-grade recombinant antibody was purified using by the following process steps and industrially available equipment: manual harvest, dispersion and extraction, pH shift in the crude extract, fiber removal by filtration, clarification by filtration, capture by affinity Protein A membrane chromatography, intermediate purification by ceramic hydroxyapatite chromatography, <b>polishing</b> by virus <b>filtration,</b> concentration by ultrafiltration, diafiltration by ultrafiltration, final concentration and formulation. The process recovery of 60 % resulted in a final yield of 3. 7 g of clinical-grade tobacco-derived antibody purified from 216 kg leaf material, equal to 880 l crude extract. The antibody was polished to a purity > 99 %, consisting of 99. 9 % monomeric Ab with an in vitro binding activity of 93 % and an in vitro neutralizing activity of 103 % relative to the CHO 2 G 12. This thesis established the basis for reproducible and predictable processing of plant material at the hundred-kilogram scale, and shows how further upscaling could be achieved...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1976 The {{development}} of whey beverages including whey wine {{has been an}} area of whey utilization research. One study to produce a commercially salable wine from sweet whey, particularly cheddar whey, was undertaken. It included developing a process to clarify the naturally cloudy wine, monitoring the physical and chemical changes which occurred during the wine making process, comparing the sensory differences in the unclarified and clarified wine, and incorporating the wine sediment in a food product. The criteria for the clarification process were simplicity, legality, reasonable cost, minimal usage of energy and equipment, and maintenance of the wine character and quality. Existing procedures for clarifying grape wine such as filtration, centrifugation, {{and the addition of}} fining agents, casein, Cold Mix Sparkolloid, gelatin, tannin, and bentonite were investigated. Also investigated were techniques used to separate the proteins from whey; specifically pH adjustment (with potassium carbonate) and precipitation (with sodium hexametaphosphate). It was found that the most feasible clarification procedure was the addition of 0. 20 - 0. 50 percent bentonite on a dry weight basis followed by a <b>polishing</b> <b>filtration.</b> Determinations for lactose, protein, fat, ash, and total solids and tests for Brix, pH, titratable acidity, and alcohol content were performed to monitor the effects of fermentation, aging, and clarification. The changes noted during fermentation and aging were primarily due to alcoholic and lactic acid fermentations. Bentonite fining had a dilution effect but did increase the ash content of the wine. Triangular difference tests with blindfolded tasters indicated that there was no significant taste difference between cloudy wine and bentonite-fined and filtered wine. A cursory gas-liquid chromatographic analysis revealed only a slight difference in the gross volatile components of unclarified and clarified wines. The wine sediment was dried to a paste and substituted at the five and ten percent levels for nonfat dry milk in a commercial sugar cookie recipe. A preference test showed that the sediment decreased the acceptability because of its "acid" taste. It is likely that the sediment could successfully be utilized in a fermented or cultured dairy product...|$|E
