I {{find that the}} U. <b>S.</b> <b>share</b> of volume {{is directly related to}} the mass of informed and liquidity traders in the United States relative to Canada, as proxied by relative analyst following, relative duration of listing, and the U. <b>S.</b> <b>share</b> of sales. Evidence also supports the market liquidity argument that the market with lower spreads and greater depths has greater volume.

40|$|In the United States, labor 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> {{of income}} falls after a {{positive}} disturbance to productivity growth or inflation, {{and it remains}} low for some time. Previous researchers {{have argued that the}} negative relationship between productivity growth and labor 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> is puzzling. I argue otherwise. A search and matching model with infrequently bargained nominal wages would predict the observed behavior of labor 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> after a productivity disturbance, and it also predicts the observed behavior of labor 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> after an inflationary disturbance. Wages at the macroeconomic level seem to be sticky in a way which is consistent with microeconomic evidence; much of the ongoing discussion about the real effects of sticky wages seems to be well-motivated, while sticky price models fail to match the data...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1980 <b>s,</b> the <b>share</b> {{of wages}} in {{national}} income declined almost {{all over the}} world. This paper {{provides an overview of}} the evolution of labour 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> in selected OECD countries. Several theoretical approaches explaining functional income distribution are summarised. In light of the different theoretical stances, this paper reviews the empirical literature on potential explanations for the prolonged fall. While heterodox economists regard neo-liberalism, financialisation and the shift in workers 2 ̆ 019 bargaining power as the main determinants for the decline in labour 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>share,</b> neoclassical economists relate the fall to skilled-biased technological change and globalisation.

40|$|There {{have been}} a number of studies {{analyzing}} the impact of unions on labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> of income. Most have relied on either time series or cross-section data. The purpose of this paper is to determine the impact of unions on labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> of income in the U. S. This study adds to the understanding of this topic by developing an analytical model of imperfect competition and estimating the model using panel data for the manufacturing sector. This study finds that unions have a positive impact on labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> of income. Specifically, this paper finds that labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> declined 17. 9 percent between 1997 and 2006 whereas, if unionization density had remained at its 1997 level, labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> would have declined only 13. 9 percent. Thus, the decline in unionization explains about 29 percent of the decline in labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> of income. This paper is important for three reasons. First, this paper sheds light on whether social and institutional forces play an important role in determining the distribution of income between labor and capital. Second, it helps to explain recent increases in wage inequality. Third, it has implications for understanding the potential impact of legislation, such as the Employee Free Choice Act, that would make it easier for workers in the U. S. to unionize...|$|R

40|$|Early time-series {{studies that}} {{examined}} {{the impact of}} unions on labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> of income were primarily descriptive. They generally found that unions did not impact labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> of income. In contrast, later studies, using either panel data or cross-section data, have produced mixed results. This study adds {{to our understanding of}} this topic by first developing an analytical model based on imperfect competition and then testing the model using time-series data for the US manufacturing sector from 1949 - 2006. The results demonstrate that unions {{have a positive impact on}} labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> of income. They show that for each one percentage point reduction in union density, the proportion of income received by production workers declines by about 0. 2 percentage points, holding other factors constant.

40|$|The U. <b>S.</b> <b>share</b> {{of world}} {{merchandise}} exports has declined sharply {{over the last}} decade. Using data {{at the level of}} detailed industries, this paper analyzes the decline in U. <b>S.</b> <b>share</b> against the backdrop of alternative measures of the competitiveness of the U. S. economy. We document the following facts: (i) only a few industries contributed to the decline in any meaningful way, (ii) {{a large part of the}} drop was driven by the changing size of U. S. export industries and not the size of U. S. sales within those industries, (iii) in a gravity framework, the majority of the decline in the U. <b>S.</b> export <b>share</b> within industries was due to the declining U. <b>S.</b> <b>share</b> of world income, and (iv) in a computed structural measure of firm productivity, average U. S. export productivity has generally maintained its high level versus other countries over time. Overall, our analysis suggests that the dismal performance of the U. <b>S.</b> market <b>share</b> is not a sufficient statistic for competitiveness.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} how trade affects women s {{job opportunities}} and earnings through five case studies: Mauritius, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines and Sri Lanka. Women <b>s</b> <b>share</b> of the labour force has increased {{over time and}} the wage gap {{between men and women}} has narrowed. A positive and statistically significant correlation between exports and women <b>s</b> <b>share</b> of employment is found while there is a statistically significant and negative correlation between women <b>s</b> <b>share</b> in employment and imports. The correlations stem from variation between sectors rather than within sectors over time, indicating that export-competing industries tend to employ women while import-competing industries tend to employ men. Trade liberalization is likely to create jobs for women and over time increase their relative wages. ...|$|R
