50|$|MPLS-TP is {{designed}} {{for use as a}} network layer technology in transport networks. It will be a continuation of the work started by the transport network experts of the ITU-T, specifically SG15, as T-MPLS. Since 2008 the work is progressed in a cooperation between ITU-T and IETF. The required protocol extensions to MPLS being designed by the IETF based on requirements <b>provided</b> <b>by</b> <b>service</b> providers. It will be a connection-oriented packet-switched (CO-PS) application. It will offer a dedicated MPLS implementation by removing features that are not relevant to CO-PS applications and adding mechanisms that provide support of critical transport functionality.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} types of actors in a service-oriented interaction: service providers, service users and service registries. They {{participate}} in a dynamic collaboration which can vary from time to time. Service providers are software services that publish their capabilities and availability with service registries. Service users are software systems (which may be services themselves) that accomplish some task {{through the use of}} services <b>provided</b> <b>by</b> <b>service</b> providers. Service users use service registries to discover and locate the service providers they can use. This discovery and location occurs dynamically when the service user requests them from a service registry.|$|E

While the Councils have geographical boundaries, in practice they only define where the members come from, as most of Los Angeles is served by routes operating out of multiple sectors. For instance, the Olympic Boulevard Rapid bus is operated by buses from the San Gabriel Valley sector, despite its entire route being in the Westside or Central Los Angeles areas. A list of routes operating from each sector {{can be found on}} the Metro web site.|$|E
5000|$|Service is <b>provided</b> <b>by</b> <b>service</b> {{buildings}}; {{access to}} the buildings has evolved through the games. In the first few games, service was distributed by zone of effect, with access determined entirely by absolute distance to the facility. In later games, a service building employs a [...] "walker". The walker will leave the service building and walk along connected roads, taking a random direction at every intersection. Eventually the walker {{will return to the}} service building directly, and the activity will repeat. As of Caesar IV, this was changed to a walking distance measure, whereby access is determined by the distance to the building following the roads; actual distance is irrelevant if the shortest route by road is still too long.|$|E
5000|$|Dr. Raja Chelliah Committee on tax reforms {{recommended}} {{the introduction of}} service tax. Service tax had been first levied {{at a rate of}} five per cent flat from 1 July 1994 till 13 May 2003, at the rate of eight percent flat w.e.f 1 plus an education cess of 2% thereon w.e.f 10 September 2004 on the services <b>provided</b> <b>by</b> <b>service</b> providers. The rate of service tax was increased to 12% by Finance Act, 2006 w.e.f 18.4.2006. Finance Act, 2007 has imposed a new secondary and higher education cess of one percent on the service tax w.e.f 11.5.2007, increasing the total education cess to three percent and a total levy of 12.36 percent. The revenue from the service tax to the Government of India have shown a steady rise since its inception in 1994. The tax collections have grown substantially since 1994-95 i.e. from [...] in 1994-95 to [...] in 2012-13. The total number of Taxable services also increased from 3 in 1994 to 119 in 2012. However, from 1 July 2012 the concept of taxation on services was changed from a 'Selected service approach' to a 'Negative List regime'. This changed the taxation system of services from tax on some Selected services to tax being levied on the every service other than services mentioned in Negative list.|$|E

5000|$|The device {{contains}} {{not only}} the cellular antenna but also about 22 MB (10 MB on older versions) of storage memory accessible to the operating system as a USB mass storage device formatted with CDfs, thus emulating a CD-ROM drive. In this memory, E220 devices supplied by mobile operators may contain 3G dialer software written by the operator, while Huawei-branded devices contain Huawei's original dialing software, which they call 'Dashboard'. Huawei's Dashboard and updates for it are also available from Huawei's website, or the 11.313.02.00.01 firmware for 7.2 Mbit/s from NetCom (in reality [...] 'flashing' [...] this device means writing a firmware image to its internal flash memory, which is different from [...] "updating the dashboard", which is simply writing a new CDFS disc image to the USB mass storage device that appears in the operating system). Flashing the firmware of this device doesn't change the USB Mass Storage memory used for the operator's software, therefore connection settings (such as APN) will be retained. When the device is first attached, Windows will automatically run the software stored on it, unless that feature has been turned off in Windows. This feature can be bypassed by pressing the Shift key while attaching the device, or by turning off the autostart feature entirely. It is possible to remove the operator branding by flashing the device with Huawei's Mobile Partner software.Huawei does not publicly release firmware updates for its devices, only Dashboard updates. The standard way of obtaining firmware updates is through the service provider, however some firmware updates are publicly available over the Internet and some users have cross-flashed (i.e. using a firmware <b>provided</b> <b>by</b> <b>service</b> provider [...] "X" [...] with modem supplied by service provider [...] "Y") their modems without trouble.Updating the modem's Dashboard does not remove or affect the network-lock (that may be in effect with modems purchased subsidized from a service provider) that prevents you from using the modem with any service provider. However updating the modem's firmware may remove this network-unlock or even the opposite, turn a network-unlock free modem into an unlocked one.|$|E

Therefore, the life cycle used for business processes may also be applied to service processes. However, the properties of service processes and the services provided require to extend the lifecycle of service processes. Therefore, the properties of service processes and services are analyzed and the resulting requirements for the process lifecycle identified. 1...|$|E

40|$|A design {{method that}} deals product and service {{simultaneously}} is becoming necessary through recent great growth of service industry. Motivated by the situation, a new discipline called Service Engineering stated its goals: visualize requirements of service receivers, evaluate and simulate services, and develop CAD tool that supports service design process. Service designer needs an evaluation method that returns quantitative value {{to choose the}} best design solution. Therefore, {{we are working on}} analysis of value <b>provided</b> <b>by</b> <b>service</b> and the quantitative evaluation development. In our approach, satisfaction of service receiver is regarded as value <b>provided</b> <b>by</b> <b>service.</b> Until now, we proposed a method that uses S-AV (Satisfaction-Attribute Value) function. The method uses service models written in the form of view model 1). As figure 1 shows, RSP (Receiver State Parameter, a requirement of the receiver) and FPs (function parameter) influencing the RSP are written as a network in the view model. The S-AV function is a bunch of mappings between satisfaction of the receiver for an RSP and FP values of the service. Here, satisfaction is expressed as a real number from- 1 to 1. The actual functions are decided by the designer from results of questionnaires. As the function changes by personality of the receiver, the designer uses Persona model 1) to describe the personality. Additionally, we proposed 3 shapes of S-AV function (Fig. 2...|$|E
