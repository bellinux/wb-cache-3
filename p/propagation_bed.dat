Bambusa balcooa, B. nutans, B. salarkhanii, B. vulgaris, B. vulgaris var. striata and Thyrsostachys oliveri) {{were tried}} by using nodal buds. Excised shoots {{were used as}} explants in transfer cultures and BAP (1 - 5 mg/l) {{was found to be}} effective growth regulator in liquid media for inducing multiple shoots (3 - 30). Half strength MS was supplemented with NAA (1 - 3 mg/l) and IBA (1 - 5 mg/l) for root induction. Two to three weeks old 3 - 5 cm long shoots in cultures were suitable for inducing rooting. Frequent changes of rooting media had improved production of rooted plantlets. Rooted plantlets were cultured in non-sterile water in the growth room for one week and after the plantlets were transferred to the <b>propagation</b> <b>bed.</b> The plantlets in propagation beds produced mini-clumps with 3 - 10 shoots within five- eight weeks. Rooted shoots of the mini-clumps were separated into two- five parts.

40|$|Within {{any of the}} {{numerous}} different types / systems of propagating trees, there are large numbers of factors that {{determine whether or not}} the propagule is in a good physiological condition, and will form a functional plant and grow. For example, when propagating from single-node, leafy cuttings from juvenile shoots, the factors that will determine the level of success are:- Stockplant environment x stockplant management x topophytic variables x node position x nursery management x post-severance treatments x propagation environment Each of these factors are themselves multi-faceted and influenced by the ambient environment (light quality and quantity, water, temperature, nutrients) of the stockplant garden, the nursery or the propagation bench. For example, in the stockplant garden the environment (light, water and nutrients) and the management of stockplants can have both short-term impacts on rooting ability by determining the levels of water or heat stress experienced by the tissues being propagated either before severance from the stockplant, or long-term impacts on rooting ability through their effects on the morphology or physiological condition of the shoots. Similarly once the cuttings have been severed from the stockplant the environment of the nursery and the handling of the severed cuttings before and after insertion in the <b>propagation</b> <b>bed</b> will also determine the levels of stress that the cuttings experience. In addition, the cuttings are also affected by the activities of the person doing the propagation and particularly the care taken by this person to minimise the levels of stress experienced by the cuttings (eg. maintenance in a cool, shady, moist environment; reduction of transpiration by leaf trimming, etc). The human element in this is what is commonly called having ‘Green fingers’ and reflects the person’s sensitivity {{to the needs of the}} plant material. ...|$|E
40|$|The rooting {{potential}} of four types or origins of Prunus avium cuttings {{from the same}} mature trees (over 20 years-old) was compared using a mist <b>propagation</b> <b>bed</b> during early Summer (June). The cuttings originated from juvenile sucker shoots of the current and previous year, and mature crown shoots (current year's lateral `long-shoots' and multi-year terminal `short shoots'). The morphological differences in inter-node length, stem diameter and leaf area between the four cutting types were highly significant (P = 0. 05), leading to large differences in cutting volume and, so it is argued, to assimilate reserves. Juvenile cuttings rooted well (65 % and 77 % rooting for hardwood and softwood shoots, respectively), while mature cuttings rooted poorly (4 % and 7 % for mature hardwood and softwood cuttings, respectively). Leaf abscission was significantly more frequent in mature hardwood cuttings (16 - 78 %) than in the other cutting types (1. 6 - 9 %) {{at the end of}} the propagation period. Leaf loss resulted from two processes: abscission and leaf rotting. Physiologically (i. e., in carbon assimilation, leaf transpiration and stomatal conductance), the four cutting types were not significantly different early in the post-severance period (day- 4); but, by day- 22, stomatal conductance was lowest in mature hardwood cuttings that still had leaves. At this time, the most physiologically-active unrooted cuttings were from juvenile hardwood and mature softwood shoots. The extent of physiological and morphological variability between cutting types and their probable impact on processes affecting rooting ability is complex and highly interactive. Consequently, it is not possible to explain the causes of the variation in rooting ability between juvenile and mature cuttings, although this study suggests that the constraints to rooting are likely to reflect physiological differences between the different cutting types. It is concluded that, to resolve the debate about factors that affect the rooting ability of juvenile and mature cuttings (i. e., ontogenetic vs. physiological ageing), there is a need to achieve morphological and physiological comparability in the tissues...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{consider}} how the rooting of cuttings may be affected by such methods and factors as: type of cutting, time of year when cuttings are best taken, differences between individual species, use of chemicals for the treatment of cuttings, rooting media, and the care of cuttings in the <b>propagation</b> <b>beds.</b> In the past 35 years scientists have done considerable experimenting with the application of organic chemicals on the roots, stems and leaves of various plants.

This study reports the positive effect of pulsed electromagnetic field on the main root characteristics (fresh weight, dry weight, root surface and length) of unrooted oregano stem cuttings. For oregano, vegetative propagation is commonly used, with rooted or unrooted stem cuttings, because seed propagation is not suggested for commercial cultivation. Oregano seeds are very small and, thus, difficult to handle. Vegetative reproduction in organic cultivation faces the ethical problem of the use of hormones to induce the rooting process in <b>propagation</b> <b>beds.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if magnetic field can replace hormones in plant propagation and what the results of the combination of both magnetic field and hormones would be. Two types of stem cuttings were used (apical and middle) and the experiment was established in two different seasons (spring and autumn). The findings showed that magnetic field alone stimulates the rooting process in plant material, with results similar to or even statistically significantly better than those obtained using hormones. However, the combination of magnetic field and hormones resulted in measurements statistically significantly lower than with magnetic field alone. Such methods can potentially be useful for plant materials growers, providing better oregano seedlings, especially in organic farming, where chemical compounds are forbidden...|$|R

Different types of rooting media: viz. fine sand (Gulabrao et al. 2012) for eight bamboo species; sand for D. asper (Singh et al. 2004) and Bambusa balcooa (Joshi et al. 2012); and loamy material (Stapleton 1985) for B. nutans, Dendrocalamus hamiltonii and D. hookeri, have been used for macropropagation of bamboo. Mixtures of coarse sand and gravel were reported in Bambusa nutans by Islam et al. (2011), sand to soil (1 : 1) for Araundinaria alpine and B. vulgaris by Senyanzobe et al. (2013). Several other substrates, namely different ratios of soil, sand and farmyard manure (FYM) for B. vulgaris (Razvi et al. 2011); soil for B. vulgaris (Bhol and Parida 2015), coarse sand mixed with fine gravel for B. vulgaris (Hossain et al. 2006); and coarse sand, soil, and sand plus soil and vermiculite for B. balcooa (Gaintait et al. 2016; Ray and Ali 2016) have also been reported to improve rooting in terms of increasing root number and root length. Sand has multiple advantages: it is inexpensive, having good drainage and aeration because of higher porosity enables oxygen to reach the developing rooting system, and maintains a relatively uniform temperature (Allaire et al. 2004; Baiyeri 2005; Shah et al. 2006; Amri 2010).|$|R

40|$|Intrastratal karst {{is by far}} the {{predominant}} gypsum karst type. Its development may begin in deep-seated settings within rocks already buried by younger strata, and it proceeds increasingly rapidly as uplift brings gypsum sequences into progressively shallower positions. Such development commonly occurs under confined (artesian) hydrogeological conditions, that subsequently change to open conditions (phreatic-water table-vadose). The general evolutionary line of intrastratal karst is typified by progressive emergence of a sequence into a shallower position, activation of groundwater circulation and development of cave systems within karst units, commencement of gravitational breakdown and its upward <b>propagation</b> through overlying <b>beds,</b> and development of a karst landscape. These processes and phenomena progress through the directed evolution of karst types as follows: deep-seated intrastratal karst (1 K) to subjacent 1 K to entrenched 1 K to denuded karst. One of the main characteristics of intrastratal karst is that it induces gravitational breakdown in cover beds. With the aid of processes other then simple breakdown, such effects may propagate upwards and may, or may not, reach the surface, depending upon the thickness and structure of the overburden.

It offers a unique opportunity to study the morphological effects of by-passing and address physical and ecological restoration approaches in regulated rivers. We conduct a space-time analysis of channel adjustment over a period of 80 years (1932 to 2011). We examine planform changes (from aerial photographs), erosional and depositional patterns (from vertical profiles), sediment sizes within the active channel and the new established floodplain, and we date riparian vegetation encroachment. Results show that the Old Rhine exhibited rapid response to the completion of the by-passing scheme in the 1950 s, with a 26 % narrowing in median active channel width between 1956 and 2008, from vegetation encroachment on dewatered channel margins (mostly groyne fields). The narrowing was accompanied by overbank fine sediment deposition (similar to 1. 5 cm y(- 1) aggradation since 1950) as well as slight bed degradation (similar to 0. 7 cm y(- 1) since 1950). We found no downstream propagation of active channel narrowing over time, nor <b>propagation</b> of <b>bed</b> degradation. The channel was already significantly adjusted prior to the diversion scheme, following the nineteenth century river straightening and groyne construction. By-passing (dewatering) mainly provided new pioneer habitat for synchronous vegetation establishment and promoted channel stability by decreasing sediment transport owing to peak flow reduction. The morphological budget calculated over the past 20 years estimated a downstream output for coarse sediments at 16, 000 m(3) y(- 1), with 80 % originating from bed degradation and 20 % from bank erosion, without significant inputs from upstream. The present-day morphodynamics remain sensitive to changes because of dynamic bed armouring (< 2. 1). This retrospective analysis permits us to discuss management strategies for altered rivers. Recommended activities are gravel reintroduction with particle-sizes finer than the armoured river bed to enhance sediment transport and promote form dynamism under current flood magnitudes. This should be coupled with river widening to allow for complex depositional patterns that benefit ecological habitats. These actions should not be implemented without prior analysis of local sediment transfer processes based on in situ experiments and modelling. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{understand}} the inundation process (wetting and drying) in the bottomlands of Dongting Lake, a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model based on shallow water equations {{has been developed}} to model complex flow regime controlled by both the Yangtze River and its own basins. The governing equations are discretized using the finite volume method with the combination of quadrilateral and triangular grids and the mass and momentum fluxes are solved using the approximate Riemann solver, HLLC scheme with high spatial resolution. The processes of wetting and drying are specially treated to simulate the flow routing over dry bed. Verification shows that the proposed method can accurately capture flow <b>propagation</b> over dry <b>bed</b> resulting from suddenly breach of the dam. This performance is preferred for inundation modeling. After theoretical test, we applied the model to simulate the inundation process in Dongting Lake. Setting the calibrated roughness parameters, we successfully simulated flow processes in the lake from 2006 to 2010. The water extent changes rapidly along with the stage fluctuation in the lake. In dry season, water is mainly limited in channels, large parts of bottomlands are exposed and water extent reaches the yearly minimum. The whole lake is inundated in the flood season and the maximum of water extent reaches. After the flood season, the bottomlands expose again along with the gradual decrease of water. Particular hydrological regimes cause the regular zonal distribution of vegetation in Dongting Lake Wetland. Hydrology in the middle Yangtze River Basin is undergoing great changes.

Velocity and attenuation were measured in four directions relative to the bedding fabric (introduced during packing of successive layers of sand grains during sample construction) and the coincident penny-shaped voids (fractures). Both samples were measured when saturated with air, water (viscosity 1 cP) and glycerin (100 cP) to reveal poro-visco-elastic effects on {{velocity and}} attenuation, and their anisotropy. The blank sample was used to estimate the background anisotropy of the host rock in the fractured sample; the bedding fabric was found to show transverse isotropy with shear wave splitting (SWS) of 1. 45 ± 1. 18 % (i. e. for S-wave <b>propagation</b> along the <b>bedding</b> planes).

The speed of force <b>propagation</b> in a <b>bed</b> of particles is estimated by plotting the dependence of the path length of the contact force on the contact time and finding the gradient of such dependence. Such approach leads to accurate results if the impact speed is below the yield velocity, i. e. no plastic deformations. It is found that the force propagation speed in spherical granular matter is proportional to the impact speed of the incident particle, which is different from force propagation in continuum matter. It is also found that the propagation speed is dependent on the material and diameters ratio of the interacting particles, but it is not dependent on the number of <b>bed</b> layers. The <b>propagation</b> speed in granular matter is normalized by dividing it by a reference propagation speed, i. e. the propagation speed at an impact speed of 1 m/s. It is found that the normalized propagation speed is independent of the material and diameter of the interacting particles, but it is logarithmically proportional to the impact speed. The proportionality constant is equal to 0. 16, which can be taken as a universal constant for force propagation in spherical granular matter...|$|R
40|$|Investigations were {{undertaken}} {{to assess the}} ability of green waste derived compost (GWC) to support the growth of nine different plant species using both bedding plant and hardy nursery stock propagation applications. These investigations were conducted to determine whether green waste derived compost may {{be considered as a}} multipurpose potting compost or suited to specific horticultural applications. Substrates incorporating 100 % GWC, 50 % GWC: 50 % Sylvafibre® (v:v), 50 % GWC: 50 % Coir (v:v) and a peat based Control were used to determine success over the different plant species. Blends incorporating 100 % GWC were found to have limited success in short term bedding plant applications, producing plants of lesser height, width and overall fresh and dry weight when compared to the Control. Blends that incorporated 50 % GWC: 50 % Coir were illustrated to perform as well as the Control substrate in short term applications. In longer term applications, such as perennial bedding and hardy nursery stock production, a change in the performance of the 100 % GWC was noted to improve over time. In these cases 100 % GWC substrate equalled or outperformed the peat based control. Incorporation of 50 % Sylvafibre® into the substrate maintained long term performance but widened the spectrum of success to a greater number of species. Over the different plant groups tested results suggest that a blend of 50 % GWC: 50 % Coir was better suited to bedding plant production whereas 50 % GWC: 50 % Sylvafibre was better suited to the longer term <b>propagation</b> of perennial <b>bedding</b> and hardy nursery stock. The addition of mycorrhizal inoculum and organic fertilisers was also seen to benefit substrate performance in some cases. The wider commercial implications of the work are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Vegetative <b>propagation</b> {{of annual}} <b>bedding</b> plants {{typically}} occurs {{during the late}} winter and early spring when ambient photosynthetic daily light integral (DLI) is low, especially in the northern United States. Vegetative cuttings are produced in two phases: a young plant stage, in which shoot-tip cuttings are rooted as liners, and a finish plant stage, in which the liners are transplanted into larger containers and grown until marketable. Previous {{studies have shown that}} DLI during the propagation (PDLI) or finish stage (FDLI) influences morphological characteristics in a number of ornamental crops. The objectives of this study were to: 1) quantify how PDLI influences subsequent growth and development of Angelonia angustifolia Benth. 2 ̆ 7 AngelMist White Cloud 2 ̆ 7 (angelonia), Nemesia fruticans (Thunb.) Benth. 2 ̆ 7 Aromatica Royal 2 ̆ 7 (nemesia), Osteospermum ecklonis (DC.) Norl. 2 ̆ 7 Voltage Yellow 2 ̆ 7 (osteospermum), and Verbena Ruiz × hybrida 2 ̆ 7 Aztec Violet 2 ̆ 7 (verbena) (Expt. 1); 2) quantify the effects and interactions of PDLI and FDLI on growth and development of these species (Expt. 2); and 3) to determine if species and cultivars of angelonia and nemesia vary in their response to PDLI (Expt. 3). Cuttings were propagated in a glass-glazed greenhouse with an air and substrate temperature set point of 22 and 23 °C, respectively. After callusing (providing DLI of about mol·m - 2 ·d- 1 for 7 d), cuttings were transferred to PDLI (about 1 to 17 mol·m- 2 ·d- 1) treatments for 14 d. For Expts. 1 and 3 FDLI was maintained at about 12 mol·m - 2 ·d- 1 during finishing to identify any residual effects of PDLI. For Expt. 2, plants were finished under a wider range of FDLIs (about 1 to 17 mol·m- 2 ·d- 1). As PDLI increased, time to first open flower (TTF) decreased for all four species. For example, TTF for angelonia and osteospermum was reduced by 23 and 19 d, respectively, as PDLI increased from 1 to 12 mol·m - 2 ·d- 1. Additionally, as PDLI and FDLI increased, TTF decreased for all species. For example, an increase in PDLI and FDLI from about 2 to 17 mol·m- 2 ·d- 1 resulted in a 46 d decrease in TTF for nemesia. Total dry mass increased as both PDLI and FDLI increased for angelonia, nemesia, osteospermum, and verbena. However, variation in branch number, height, root to shoot ratio, and node number among species was observed in response to increasing PDLI and FDLI. Time to flower for most cultivars of angelonia and most cultivars and species of nemesia responded similarly to PDLI. Increasing PDLI resulted in a decreased TTF for all species and cultivars of angelonia and nemesia; however, the extent of the decrease was variable. For example, as PDLI increased from 2 to 17 mol·m - 2 ·d- 1, TTF decreased by 24 and 20 d for angelonia 2 ̆ 7 Carita Cascade 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 Sundancer White 2 ̆ 7 and 5 and 8 d for angelonia 2 ̆ 7 AngelMist 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 Arch Angel White 2 ̆ 7, respectively. Results from this research can be used to predict and manage growth and flowering under varying PDLIs and FDLIs for angelonia, nemesia, osteospermum, and verbena. ...|$|R
40|$|The thesis, through {{experimental}} and numerical investigations {{reports on the}} work related to packed bed reactors in co-current configuration for biomass gasification. This study has extensively focused on the gasification operating regimes and addressing the issues of presence of tar, an undesirable component for engine application. Systematically, the influence of fuel properties on the gasification process has been studied using single particle analysis and also in packed bed reactors. Studies related {{to the effect of}} fuel properties - size, surface area volume ratio and density on the reactor performance are addressed. The influence of these parameters on the propagation rate which indirectly influences the residence time, tar generation, gas compositions is explicitly elucidated. Most of the reported work in literature primarily focuses on counter-current configurations and analysis on propagation flame front/ignition mass flux and temperature profiles mostly under the combustion regime. In this work, flame <b>propagation</b> front movement, <b>bed</b> movement and effective movement for a co-current packed bed reactor of different reactor capacities and a generalized approach towards establishing ‘effective propagation rate’ has been proposed. The work also reports on the importance of particle size and sharing of air from the top and through nozzles on tar generation in the open top down draft reactor configuration. Firstly, pyrolysis, {{an important component of the}} thermochemical conversion process has been studied using the flaming time for different biomass samples having varying size, shape and density. The elaborate experiments on the single particle study provides an insight into the reasons for high tar generation for wood flakes/coconut shells and also identifies the importance of the fuel particle geometry related to surface area and volume ratio. Effect of density by comparing the flaming rate of wood flakes and coconut shells with the wood sphere for an equivalent diameter is highlighted. It is observed that the tar level in the raw gas is about 80 % higher in the case of wood flakes and similar values for coconut shells compared with wood pieces. The analysis suggests that the time for pyrolysis is lower with a higher surface area particle and is subjected to nearly fast pyrolysis process resulting in higher tar fraction with low char yield. Similarly, time for pyrolysis increases with density as observed from the experimental measurements by using coconut shells and wood flakes and concludes the influence on the performance of packed bed reactors. Studies on co-current reactor under various operating conditions from closed top reactor to open top reburn configuration suggests improved residence time reduces tar generation. This study establishes, increased residence time with staged air flow has a better control on residence time and yields lower tar in the raw gas. Studies on the influence of air mass flux on the propagation rate, peak temperature, and gas quality, establishes the need to consider bed movement in the case of co-current packed bed reactor. It is also observed that flame front propagation rate initially increases as the air mass flux is increased, reaches a peak and subsequently decreases. With increase in air mass flux, fuel consumption increases and thereby the bed movement. The importance of bed movement and its effect on the propagation front movement has been established. To account for variation in the fuel density, normalized propagation rate or the ignition mass flux is a better way to present the result. The peak flame front propagation rates are 0. 089 mm/s for 10 % moist wood at an air mas flux of 0. 130 kg/m 2 -s and while 0. 095 mm/s for bone-dry wood at an air mass flux of 0. 134 kg/m 2 -s. These peak propagation rates occur with the air mass flux in the range of 0. 130 to 0. 134 kg/m 2 -s. The present results compare well with those available in the literature on the effective propagation rate with the variation of air mass flux, and deviations are linked to fuel properties. The propagation rate correlates with mass flux as ̇. during the increasing regime of the front movement. The extinction of flame propagation or the front receding has been established both experimentally supported from the model analysis and is found to be at an air mass flux of 0. 235 kg/m 2 -s. The volume fraction of various gaseous species at the reactor exits obtained from the experiment is 14. 89 ± 0. 28 % CO 2, 15. 75 ± 0. 43 % CO and 11. 09 ± 1. 99 % H 2 respectively with the balance being CH 4 and N 2. The model analysis using an in-house program developed for packed bed reactor provide a comprehensive understanding with respect to the performance of packed bed reactor under gasification conditions. The model addresses the dependence on air mass flux on gas composition and propagation rate and is used to validate the experimental results. Based on the energy balance in the reaction front, the analysis clearly identifies the reasons for stable propagation front and receding front in a co-current reactor. From the experiments and modelling studies, it is evident that turn-down ratio of a downdraft gasification system is scientifically established. Both the {{experimental and}} the numerical studies presented in the current work establishes that the physical properties of the fuel have an impact on the performance of the co-current reactor and for the first time, the importance of bed movement on the propagation rate is identified...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{constitutes}} fundamental {{experimental and}} computational investigations on gasification and combustion in a packed bed of biomass. Packed bed gasification-combustion in counter-current mode {{is used in}} two applications -(1) Gasifier stove in reverse downdraft mode (or equivalently, top-lit updraft mode) that constitutes the idea behind efficient and clean burning domestic stoves. (2) Combustion-on moving grate for boiler application, studied widely in Europe. While {{a large part of}} the present study is around domestic stoves, a crucial part of the study aims to address the second application as an extension of the approach taken in the first part to clarify conflicting conclusions of earlier studies and explain the aero-thermochemical behavior over the entire range of superficial velocities, V s (this is velocity of air through the empty cross section of the reactor). Operational differences between the two applications lie in the range of superficial velocity - 3. 5 to 6 cm/s for domestic stoves and 15 to 30 cm/s for grate combustion. Lower values of Vs are chosen for domestic stoves to limit the particulate emissions; higher values of V s for combustion-on-grate to maximize the conversion rate. Present work deals with a fan based gasifier stove, Oorja, built by BP, India (currently transferred to FEPL, Pune) and disseminated to over 400, 000 households between 2005 and 2009. The technology was developed at CGPL, IISc and transferred to BP for commercialization. Work reported in this thesis was started to resolve issues of higher CO emissions in char mode operation and occasional smoking during transition from flaming to char mode. The contribution of the thesis is split into two parts. (a) Use of the principles of gasification to improve the performance of the stoves to the highest possible level, balancing between efficiency and ash fusion issues for domestic and industrial applications and (b) fundamental studies to unravel the flame structure in the two-phase gasification-combustion process over the entire range of Vs. Improving the stove performance It has been known that in most free-convection based stoves, like three stone fire and others developed over the last two decades, the amount of energy extracted from the stove by a cooking pot, usually measured as water boiling efficiency, is between 15 to 35 % with CO emissions of more than 1. 5 g/MJ. Oorja stove had demonstrated water boiling efficiency of 50 % and CO emissions of 0. 75 g/MJ. Operational issues noticed in the field provided an opportunity to further improve the performance by conducting detailed thermo-chemical studies. Towards this, the components of water boiling efficiency in different phases and from different modes of heat transfer were determined. Optimizing the ratio of air flow rate between combustion air from top and gasification air through the grate (denoted by R) was the key to improving the performance. The maximum water boiling efficiency obtained was 62 % with 0. 53 g/MJ CO for a 320 mm diameter vessel; under these conditions, the first phase, termed flaming mode, involving pyrolysis-gasification-gas phase combustion contributed 45 % to the total efficiency and 0. 4 g/MJ CO at R = 4. 8 and the second phase, termed char mode, involving char surface oxidation-gasification-gas phase combustion contributed 17 % and 0. 13 g/MJ CO at R = 1. 9. Under optimal air flow conditions, efficiency depends on the size of the vessel used; reactive flow calculations were performed with fast chemistry (using mixture fraction approach) in a zone that includes the free space of the combustion chamber and the vessel to obtain the heat transfer efficiency and bring out the effect of vessel size. Experiments aimed at evaluating the performance of the stove on either side of stoichiometry, revealed that while the stove could be operated on the rich side, it was not possible to operate it on the lean side -it was always tending towards the stoichiometric point with enhanced power. Computational studies showed that increased air flow from the top caused enhanced recirculation around the fuel bed bringing more oxygen that reacted closer to the surface and transferred additional heat enhancing the pyrolysis rate, explaining the observed shift towards stoichiometry. An examination of literature showed that the energy balance for stoves had long remained unexplained (unaccounted losses in stoves were up to 40 %). Using the different components of efficiency obtained from experiments and computations, a heat balance was established to within 5 %. This vast improvement in the heat balance is due to the fact that the unaccounted loss in the earlier estimates was essentially due to poor combustion, but was not so recognized. The very significant increase in combustion efficiency in this class of stoves allowed the possibility of estimating other components reasonably accurately. This is a direct consequence of the two stage gasification-combustion process yielding steady flow of gases which contain 80 % (gasification efficiency) of the input energy enabling near-stoichiometric combustion with the help of controlled supply of combustion air. Fundamental studies Experiments with wood chips (615 kg/m 3) and pellets (1260 kg/m 3) showed that particle density has no effect on single particle and packed bed combustion in flaming mode beyond the role played through the surface energy balance (involving the product of fuel density and propagation rate, ˙r). Same is true for single char particles. A transport controlled combustion model taking into account the ash build up over the char surface confirmed this behaviour and showed that the phenomenon follows d 2 law, where d is the equivalent diameter of the fuel particle, consistent with the experimental results. But packed bed of char particles showed distinct dependence on particle density. Differences were traced to poor thermal environment faced by low density wood char pieces compared to pellet char leading to variations in the volumetric heat release rate. A composite picture of the operational behaviour of the packed <b>bed</b> flame <b>propagation</b> was obtained from the measurements of exit gas composition, bed temperature, temperature of gas phase and condensed phase surface using 100 µm thermocouples, O 2 drop across the flame front using lambda sensor as a function of Vs. The packed bed studies were conducted in insulated steel and glass reactors. These studies clearly showed distinctive regimes in the bed behavior. In the first regime from Vs = 3 to 17 cm/s, (a) the propagation rate increases with Vs, (b) the fractions of CO, H 2 are at least 10 %, CH 4 drops from 3 to 1 %, (c) the oxygen fraction is near zero, (d) the gas phase temperature in the bed is constant at about 1600 K, (e) the condensed phase surface temperature increase from 850 K to 1600 K and (f) oxygen fraction drops from 0. 21 to 0. 0 within a single particle depth and coincides with the gas phase ignition. The inferences drawn from these data are that (i) the process is diffuusion controlled (ii) the bed operates in fuel rich mode, (iii) char participates only in reduction reactions. In the second domain from V s = 17 cm/s up to about 50 cm/s, (a) the propagation rate is nearly constant (b) the mass fractions of CO and H 2 drops to less than 5 %, CH 4 decreases further, (c) oxygen fraction remains near zero, (d) CO 2 increases, (e) gas phase and surface temperatures are nearly equal and increase from 1600 K to 2200 K and match with the equilibrium temperature at that equivalence ratio, (f) oxygen fraction drops from 0. 21 to 0 in one particle depth like in the first regime indicating diffuusion limitedness in this regime as well, (g) unlike in the first regime, volatiles from biomass are convected up to the next layer suppressing a local flame and char oxidation dominates. Beyond Vs = 50 cm/s, the propagation ceased to occur. The precise value of the extinction V s depended on the rate of increase of Vs in this range. A faster change initiated the extinction earlier. Observations showed that extinction began at some location around the periphery and spread laterally. Extinction at one layer was adequate to complete the extinction process. To explain the observed behaviour a simple zero-dimensional model tracking the heating of a fresh biomass particle upstream of the propagating flame front because of radiative heat transfer was set up. This equation was coupled with the equation for single particle flaming combustion to explain the behavior in the first regime. In order to explain the observed flattening of propagation rate in the second regime, it was found essential to account for the effect of the ash layer building on the oxidizing char particle and the temperature dependence of ash emissivity, on the radiative heat transfer to fresh biomass. The results of the model coupled with the experimental data from all sources on a corrected propagation rate vs. V s showed a universal behaviour that is considered a very important recognition of the packed <b>bed</b> <b>propagation</b> behaviour. Combining theory and experiments was essential to explain the extinction. The features are: (a) the presence of ash layer over the surface is shown to be responsible for maintaining a steady char conversion in a single particle at low stream speeds, (b) the feature that the ash layer would be blown away at stream velocities of 2. 5 to 3 m/s in a single particle combustion, (c) with V s close to 50 cm/s, local velocities of air ﬂow through the bed can reach 2 to 3 m/s, this value being sensitive to the bed arrangement (with slight shifting or settling of one particle leading to increase of the local velocity at the periphery). Thus, the high local speeds of flow through the bed (more than 2 m/s) was considered responsible for removal of ash layer such that radiation losses would be dominant and cause local extinction of the reaction front at the char surface. Thus, this study has led to a comprehensive understanding of the gasification-combustion behavior of packed bed in stoves and on grates. It has also led to the evolution of parameters for obtaining high efficiency and low emissions (HELE) from stoves -both domestic and industrial. Most interestingly, it has resulted in recognition of an universal behavior of flame propagation rate through packed bed of biomass...|$|R
