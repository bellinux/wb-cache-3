40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{literature}} about <b>peer</b> <b>and</b> self-assessment in university courses {{from the point}} of view of their use, and the suitability of their use, in the first year of university study. The paper is divided into three parts. The first part argues that although first-year students are involved in many of the studies that report on the use of <b>peer</b> <b>and</b> self-assessment in higher education, the proportion of these studies that do so is somewhat less than in other year levels. In addition, relatively little of this work directly and explicitly discusses the suitability of <b>peer</b> <b>and</b> self-assessment for students and courses at this year level. The second part of the paper provides an introductory exploration of the relationship between <b>peer</b> <b>and</b> self-assessment, and specific features of first-year assessment, learning and teaching. Three issues relating directly to the suitability of <b>peer</b> <b>and</b> self-assessment in the first year are explored. In the third part, the paper briefly discusses the desirability of implementing <b>peer</b> <b>and</b> self-assessment, in general, before seeking to extend this specifically to the first year. The paper concludes by recommending that greater use can and should be made of <b>peer</b> <b>and</b> self-assessment in the first year of university study.

40|$|The goal of {{the current}} study was to {{investigate}} whether <b>peer</b> rejection <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> victimization mediated the relation between children’s aggressive behaviors and depressive symptoms. Participants were 533 fourth- and fifth-grade children (289 girls and 244 boys). Data on aggression <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> victimization were collected through teacher <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> report, whereas data on depressive symptoms were collected through self-, teacher, <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> report. Peer rejection was measured through peer nominations of liking and disliking. Through testing two competing concurrent structural models, results revealed that <b>peer</b> rejection <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> victimization jointly mediated the overall relation between aggression and depressive symptoms, although this mediation was only partial. Furthermore, peer rejection partially mediated the relation between aggression <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> victimization, <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> victimization partially mediated the relation between <b>peer</b> rejection <b>and</b> depressive symptoms.

40|$|Self-, <b>peer,</b> <b>and</b> {{assessor}} evaluations in {{an assessment}} center {{were compared to}} determine whether these three sources utilized {{the same types of}} performance information when making overall assessments of managerial potential. <b>Peer</b> <b>and</b> assessor evaluations were expected to show more similarity in terms of information usage than either source would show with self-evaluations. Participants were 186 employees of a large petroleum company rated in an assessment center. Self-, <b>peer,</b> <b>and</b> assessor evaluations were made on six performance dimensions and on overall managerial potential. Results supported the first hypothesis that self-assessments of managerial potential would be based to a greater extent on information not generated in the assessment center (due to pre-existing knowledge of the self) than would <b>peer</b> <b>and</b> assessor evalua-tions. However, the second hypothesis was not supported since asses-sors <b>and</b> <b>peers</b> weighted the six performance dimensions least similarly, contrary to predictions that self-ratings would be least similar. The impact of the rating context (job versus assessment center) was dis-cussed as a possible explanation for the unexpected similarity of self-evaluations with both <b>peer</b> <b>and</b> assessor evaluations in the present study. Historically, research on ratings of performance dimensions in the Industrial/Organizational Psychology literature has emphasized accu-rate measurement. Disagreement among rating sources (e. g., self-, <b>peer,</b> <b>and</b> assessor or supervisor) has long been viewed as problematic and as indicative of both rating bias and lack of construct validity.

40|$|In {{order to}} develop the skills and competences {{required}} in a professional environment, university students have {{to reflect on their}} own role in the learning process. The traditional methods of assessment do not assess reflective thinking, critical thinking, self-evaluation <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> evaluation. The following paper outlines and evaluates the implementation of <b>peer</b> <b>and</b> self-assessment techniques in higher education, in ESP course at the National Technical University of Ukraine ?Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute? as a case study. The rationale of the alternative type assessment systems is examined, and the efficiency of these methods is evaluated and compared by the use of attitudinal questionnaires completed by the participating students and the lecturer?s assessments and feedback. The methodology to investigate the effect of <b>peer</b> <b>and</b> self-assessment {{as a part of the}} learning process includes literature observation, case study, developing marking criteria, examples of <b>peer</b> <b>and</b> self- assessment strategies and activities in ESP course. Forty quantitative <b>peer</b> <b>and</b> self-assessment studies were subjected to analysis. The study pointed to differences between self <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> assessments. Peer assessment was found to resemble more closely teacher assessments whereas self-assessment demonstrated difference with teacher?s marks. One of the most essential conditions for objective and relevant performance of the evaluation was found as well-understood assessment criteria. Hypotheses concerning the greater validity of <b>peer</b> <b>and</b> self- assessments were not supported. We have drawn the conclusions that the application of <b>peer</b> <b>and</b> self- assessment methods improves students? critical thinking skills, involves students into learning and assessment processes, keeps motivation up to study and provides them with a greater ownership of the whole learning and assessment process. Therefore <b>peer</b> <b>and</b> self-assessment techniques could be effectively implemented in the course of ESP at universities...|$|R
