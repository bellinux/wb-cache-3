2500|$|The {{game was}} created in 1954 by Edmond Dujardin, and was quite similar to the earlier American {{automotive}} card game Touring. A key innovation was {{the addition of the}} [...] ("underhanded trick"), whereby bonus points are earned by holding back a safety card (such as the <b>puncture-proof</b> tire) until an opponent plays the corresponding hazard card (in this case, the flat tire).|$|E

50|$|To satisfy urban cyclists' needs, {{bicycles}} {{are designed}} to provide their riders with comfort.

5000|$|Johnson {{continued}} to invent additional control devices, {{as well as}} products such as chandeliers, springless door locks, <b>puncture-proof</b> tires, thermometers, and a hose coupling for providing steam heat to passenger railcars. He also designed pneumatic tower clocks, {{one of which was}} built for the Milwaukee City Hall tower.|$|E
50|$|Dzik (Wild Boar) is a 4.5-ton Polish-made {{multi-purpose}} infantry mobility vehicle. Produced by the AMZ {{works in}} Kutno, {{it is designed}} for serving both the patrol and intervention roles, {{as well as an}} armoured personnel carrier for use by various peace-keeping and policing forces. Its armour provides defence against 7.62 mm bullets. The Dzik-3 also boasts bulletproof windows, <b>puncture-proof</b> tires and smoke launchers.|$|E
50|$|Other {{things to}} be {{considered}} should be the load shape compared with the backrest shape, e.g., cylindrical loads should sit on curved backrests, and the environmental conditions in which the hand truck will operate. For example, on loose or uneven ground oversize wheels are a great advantage; solid or <b>puncture-proof</b> foam filled tires may be used where punctures could deflate pneumatic tires.|$|E

5000|$|The Classic Mobike, or [...] "Mobike", is the {{standard}} variant of Mobike bicycles. It has an all-aluminium, V-shaped chassis, <b>puncture-proof</b> tires, and a shaft transmission system. Instead of conventional wire spokes, it uses five sets of two thick, parallel, metal rods positioned at 72° from each other to improve durability and lower maintenance costs. The identification number of each bicycle is put on the rear part of the chassis.|$|E
50|$|Sam {{receives}} {{a letter from}} the National Tire Company expressing interest in one of his inventions, <b>puncture-proof</b> tires that can resist bullets. He goes in his car, which is fitted with four of his tires, and offers to give a demonstration by shooting at the tires; {{while he was in the}} boardroom, however, his car had been towed and a similar-looking police car is now in its place. The tires (naturally) fail to resist Sam's bullets, and the police chase after him.|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} {{to the threat of}} HIV transmission via drug injection with shared needles, Australia developed a needle and syringe exchange program that {{became one of the most}} comprehensive in the world. Originally health professionals and pharmacists were given the responsibility of implementing the program. However, community-based AIDS organizations were soon also funded to distribute sterile injecting equipment, alcohol swabs, <b>puncture-proof</b> disposable containers, condoms, and safe sex information. Nearly all of the programs operated on a no-need-for-exchange basis, during hours and from outlets (both fixed and mobile) that were convenient for users. Their success in preventing the widespread transmission of HIV among injecting drug users was demonstrated in international studies that found a large discrepancy between the rates of HIV infection in cities with, and without, needle and syringe exchange programs, and was reflected in the continued low level of HIV infection among injecting drug users in Australia. Australia’s success in preventing HIV transmission among drug users suggests the merits of the “harm reduction” approach to controlling drug use as well as funding community- based needle and syringe exchange programs...|$|E
40|$|Disaster-affected {{populations are}} highly {{vulnerable}} to outbreaks of measles. Therefore, a mass vaccination against measles {{was conducted in}} Aila cyclone-affected blocks of West Bengal, India in July 2009. The objectives of the present report were to conduct an in depth analysis of the campaign, and to discuss the major challenges. A block level micro-plan, which included mapping of the villages, health facilities, temporary settlements of disaster-affected population, communications available, formation of vaccination team, information education communication, vaccine storage, waste disposal, surveillance for adverse events following immunization, supervision and monitoring was developed. The rate of six months to five years old children, who were vaccinated by measles vaccine, was 70. 7 % and that of those who received one dose of vitamin A was 71. 3 %. Wastage factor for vaccine doses and auto-disable syringes were 1. 09 and 1. 07, respectively. Only 13 cases of adverse events following immunization were reported. An average of 0. 91 <b>puncture-proof</b> containers per vaccination session was used. Despite the major challenges faced due to difficult to reach areas, inadequate infrastructure, manpower and communication, problems of vaccine storage and transport, the campaign achieved a remarkable success regarding measles vaccine coverage, improvements of cold chain infrastructure, formulating an efficient surveillance and reporting system for adverse events following immunization, building self-confidence of the stakeholder...|$|E
40|$|Background: Occupational {{exposure}} to percutaneous injuries {{is a substantial}} source of infections with blood-borne pathogens among health-care workers. Few studies evaluated injection safety practices in Saudi Arabia. Objective: To examine the structure and process of injection safety at primary health care level in Jazan health district, to evaluate knowledge, attitudes, and practices of primary health care physicians and nurses towards injection safety, and to determine the incidence of needle stick injuries among health care workers in Jazan region, Saudi Arabia. Methods: A cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} Jazan primary health care centers (PHCCs), Saudi Arabia from September 2011 to March 2012. Data were collected using an observational checklist and data collection sheet. Jazan city health district was chosen at random from the 14 health sectors in Jazan region. All the 33 (10 urban, and 23 rural) PHCCs of Jazan city were included in this study to get the predetermined sample size of health care workers. 200 health care workers (HCWs) were recruited (29 % physicians, and 71 % nurses). Results: Syringes in the PHCCs were disposable (100 %), individually packed (92 %), and available at all volumes (98 %). Methods of safe disposal of needles and sharps were also operated through contracting with professional companies in 84. 8 % of instances. Urban PHCCs had more posts for injection safety promotion than rural centers (p= 0. 02).  Continuous Medical Education (CME) programs on infection control were present in only 60 % of PHCCs. At least 95 % of HCWs in Jazan believed that sharp objects should be kept in a <b>puncture-proof</b> container, kept in a closed container, or disposed by a professional company. More than 80 % of HCWs washed their hands by soap and water and cleaned them by alcohol before giving injection, and also got the three doses of hepatitis B vaccine. The rate of needle stick injury in the past year was 14 %, without a significant difference between nurses and physicians (p= 0. 8). Conclusion: Jazan PHCCs have reasonable facilities that prevent needle-stick injuries. We need to design and implement more educational programs on safety injection, and increase promotion of safety injection posters, especially in rural PHCCs...|$|E
