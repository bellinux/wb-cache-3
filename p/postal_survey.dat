40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the role of qualitative personal interviews in international business research. Based on an ongoing research into more than 120 transnational corporations from Hong Kong and more than 60 of their subsidiaries and/or affiliates in Southeast Asia, I argue that the qualitative personal interview method is a much better technique than other common techniques in international business research such as <b>postal</b> <b>surveys</b> and telephone interviews. This argument is particularly relevant when the research is conducted in an urban context and the objective is to probe deeply into the processes and mechanisms of international business. Another dimension of the qualitative personal interview method is that it provides much flexibility both in the conduct of data collection and subsequent analysis. This advantage proves to be critical to international business research because of the changing context of research and concern with business firms operating simultaneously in several geographical locations.

40|$|Concerns {{over the}} overall cost of {{marketing}} research and the cost per usable response have in large measure caused marketing practitioners to turn to online marketing research techniques, either as a solus technique, or in a mixed mode application.

This paper examines an earlier study before reporting findings from the present study, which employs a method that ascertains the probability of commissioning and/or responding to four survey research methods, described in scenarios and delivered using e-mail and the World Wide Web (Web). It is evident that while perceptions of e-mail, the Internet, and privacy have changed since early use of the Internet and more particularly the World Wide Web, and there is acknowledgment in the literature concerning the lower costs and faster response speeds of online marketing research, small businesses do appear to discriminate in favour of targeted online <b>survey</b> methods over <b>postal</b> <b>surveys,</b> portrayed as scenarios in this study.
