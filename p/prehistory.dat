5|$|Prehistoric Orkney {{refers to}} a period in the human {{occupation}} of the Orkney archipelago of Scotland that was {{the latter part of}} these islands' <b>prehistory.</b> The period of <b>prehistory</b> prior to occupation by the genus Homo is part of the geology of Scotland. Although some written records refer to Orkney during the Roman invasions of Scotland, <b>prehistory</b> in northern Scotland does not end until the commencement of the Early Historic Period around AD 600.|$|E
5|$|The museum {{highlights}} Vietnam's <b>prehistory</b> (about 300,000–400,000 years ago) {{up to the}} August 1945 Revolution. It {{has over}} 200,000 exhibits displayed covering items from <b>prehistory</b> up to the 1947 revolution and founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, arranged in five major sections.|$|E

5|$|After {{publishing}} <b>Prehistory</b> of Scotland (1935), Childe produced one of {{the defining}} books of his career, Man Makes Himself (1936). Influenced by Marxist views of history, Childe argued that the usual distinction between (pre-literate) <b>prehistory</b> and (literate) history was a false dichotomy and that human society has progressed {{through a series of}} technological, economic and social revolutions. These included the Neolithic Revolution, when hunter-gatherers began settling in permanent farming communities, through to the Urban Revolution, when society progressed from a series of small towns through to the first cities, and right up to more recent times, when the Industrial Revolution changed the nature of production.|$|E
5|$|The Belgrade City Museum {{moved into}} a new {{building}} in downtown in 2006. The Museum hosts a range of collections covering the history of urban life since <b>prehistory.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} theme {{represented by}} George Rogers Clark NHP is the “Revolution, War in the Frontier,” according to 1987 History and <b>Prehistory</b> in the National Park System and the National Historic Landmarks Program.|$|E
5|$|Carbon was {{discovered}} in <b>prehistory</b> and was known in the forms of soot and charcoal to the earliest human civilizations. Diamonds were known probably as early as 2500BCE in China, while carbon {{in the form of}} charcoal was made around Roman times by the same chemistry as it is today, by heating wood in a pyramid covered with clay to exclude air.|$|E
5|$|Childe {{continued}} {{writing and}} publishing books on archaeology, {{beginning with a}} series of works following on from The Dawn of European Civilisation and The Aryans by compiling and synthesising data from across Europe. First was The Most Ancient Near East (1928), which assembled information from across Mesopotamia and India, setting a background from which the spread of farming and other technologies into Europe could be understood. This was followed by The Danube in <b>Prehistory</b> (1929) which examined the archaeology along the Danube river, recognising it as the natural boundary dividing the Near East from Europe; Childe believed that it was via the Danube that new technologies travelled westward in <b>prehistory.</b> The book introduced the concept of an archaeological culture to Britain from Germany, revolutionising the theoretical approach of British archaeology.|$|E
5|$|Childe {{has been}} {{considered}} the principal contributor to archaeological methodology {{in the first part}} of the 20th century. His theoretical approach blended together Marxism, diffusionism, and functionalism. Childe was critical of the evolutionary archaeology which was dominant during the 19thcentury. He believed that those archaeologists who adhered to it placed a greater emphasis on artefacts themselves rather than their makers. He recognised flaws in the technological-based three-age system first developed by Danish antiquarian Christian Jürgensen Thomsen, rejecting its evolutionary chronology that divided <b>prehistory</b> into the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age by noting that many of the world's societies were still effectively Stone Age in their technology. He nevertheless saw it as a useful model for analysing socio-economic development when combined with a Marxist model. He therefore used technological criteria for dividing up <b>prehistory</b> into three ages, but instead used economic criteria for sub-dividing the Stone Age into the Palaeolithic and Neolithic, rejecting the concept of the Mesolithic as useless.|$|E
5|$|For a {{brief period}} Orkney emerged from <b>prehistory</b> and into protohistory. The Greek {{explorer}} Pytheas visited Britain sometime between 322 and 285 BC and may have circumnavigated the mainland. In his On the Ocean he refers to the most northerly point as Orcas, conceivably a reference to Orkney.|$|E
5|$|Gibraltar's {{appearance}} in <b>prehistory</b> was very different. Whereas {{today it is}} surrounded by sea, the water level was much lower in prehistoric times, when the polar ice caps were larger. The current peninsula {{was surrounded by a}} fertile coastal plain, with marshes and sand dunes supporting an abundant variety of animals and plants.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, Childe left Edinburgh {{to take up}} the {{position}} as Director and Professor of European <b>Prehistory</b> at the Institute of Archaeology (IOA) in London. Anxious to return to the capital, he had kept silent over his disapproval of government policies so {{that he would not be}} prevented from getting the job. He took up residence at Lawn Road Flats near to Hampstead.|$|E
5|$|In linguistics, R. M. W. Dixon has {{proposed}} a punctuated equilibrium model for language histories, with reference particularly to the <b>prehistory</b> of the indigenous languages of Australia and his objections to the proposed Pama–Nyungan language family there. Although his model has raised considerable interest, it does not command majority support within linguistics.|$|E
5|$|The Archaic is {{the longest}} period of Iowa <b>prehistory,</b> lasting about 8,000 years. Overall, populations appear to have {{increased}} in Iowa during the Archaic, despite a changing climate. During this time American Indians transitioned from highly mobile hunters and gatherers with large ranges towards a focus on local resources and ecosystems. Domesticated plants appeared in Iowa {{towards the end of}} the Archaic.|$|E
5|$|The Chestnuts Long Barrow, {{also known}} as Stony or Long Warren, is a {{chambered}} long barrow located near {{to the village of}} Addington in the southeastern English county of Kent. Constructed circa 4000 BCE, during the Early Neolithic period of British <b>prehistory,</b> today it survives only in a ruined state.|$|E
5|$|The {{heaviness}} of {{naturally occurring}} metals such as gold, copper, and iron {{may have been}} noticed in <b>prehistory</b> and, {{in light of their}} malleability, led to the first attempts to craft metal ornaments, tools, and weapons. All metals discovered from then until 1809 had relatively high densities; their heaviness was regarded as a singularly distinguishing criterion.|$|E
5|$|Animals, often mammals but {{including}} {{fish and}} insects among other groups, {{have been the}} subjects of art from the earliest times, in both early history as in Ancient Egypt, and <b>prehistory,</b> as in the cave paintings at Lascaux and other sites in the Dordogne, France and elsewhere. Major artistic depictions of animals include Albrecht Dürer's 1515 The Rhinoceros, and George Stubbs's c. 1762 horse portrait Whistlejacket.|$|E
5|$|Historians like Milcíades Peña {{consider}} this historical {{period of the}} Americas as pre-capitalist, as most production of the coastal cities was destined to overseas markets. Rodolfo Puiggrós consider it instead a feudalist society, based on work relations such as the encomienda or the slavery. Norberto Galasso and Enrique Rivera consider that it was neither capitalist nor feudalist, but an hybrid system result of {{the interaction of the}} Spanish civilization, on the transition from feudalism to capitalism, and the natives, still living in the <b>prehistory.</b>|$|E
5|$|Horses were {{probably}} ridden in <b>prehistory</b> {{before they were}} driven. However, evidence is scant, mostly simple images of human figures on horse-like animals drawn on rock or clay. The earliest tools used to control horses were bridles of various sorts, which were invented nearly {{as soon as the}} horse was domesticated. Evidence of bit wear appears on the teeth of horses excavated at the archaeology sites of the Botai culture in northern Kazakhstan, dated 35003000 BC.|$|E
5|$|Modern mythographers {{have seen}} the story of Orion {{as a way to}} access local folk tales and cultic {{practices}} directly without the interference of ancient high culture; several of them have explained Orion, each through his own interpretation of Greek <b>prehistory</b> and of how Greek mythology represents it. There are some points of general agreement between them: for example, that the attack on Opis is an attack on Artemis, for Opis is one of the names of Artemis.|$|E
5|$|Mount Vesuvius has erupted many times. The famous {{eruption}} in AD 79 was {{preceded by}} numerous others in <b>prehistory,</b> including at least three significantly larger ones, the best known being the Avellino eruption around 1800 BC which engulfed several Bronze Age settlements. Since AD 79, the volcano has also erupted repeatedly, in 172, 203, 222, possibly in 303, 379, 472, 512, 536, 685, 787, around 860, around 900, 968, 991, 999, 1006, 1037, 1049, around 1073, 1139, 1150, and {{there may have been}} eruptions in 1270, 1347, and 1500.|$|E
5|$|Some Neolithic flint tools {{recovered}} {{from the top of}} the Tor show that the site has been visited, perhaps with lasting occupation, since <b>prehistory.</b> The nearby remains of Glastonbury Lake Village were identified at the site in 1892, which confirmed that there was an Iron Age settlement in about 300–200BC on what was an easily defended island in the fens. There is no evidence of permanent occupation of the Tor, but finds, including Roman pottery, do suggest that it was visited on a regular basis.|$|E
5|$|The National Museum of Beirut {{currently}} exhibits 1300 {{artifacts from}} its collection of approximately 100,000 objects. The museum displays follow a chronological circuit beginning in <b>Prehistory</b> and ending in the Ottoman era. The circuit begins {{on the ground}} floor where 83 large objects are displayed, these include sarcophagi, mosaics statues and reliefs. The upper floor displays 1243 small and medium-sized artifacts arranged by chronological order and by theme in modern showcases with soft lighting and magnifying glasses that emphasize the aesthetic aspect of the artifacts.|$|E
5|$|The Osiris myth {{reached its}} basic form in or before the 24th century BCE. Many of its {{elements}} originated in religious ideas, but {{the struggle between}} Horus and Set may have been partly inspired by a regional conflict in Egypt's early history or <b>prehistory.</b> Scholars have tried to discern {{the exact nature of}} the events that gave rise to the story, but they have reached no definitive conclusions.|$|E
5|$|The archeological {{record for}} the <b>prehistory</b> of Biblical Hebrew is far more {{complete}} than the record of Biblical Hebrew itself. Early Northwest Semitic (ENWS) materials are attested from 2350BCE to 1200BCE, {{the end of the}} Bronze Age. The Northwest Semitic languages, including Hebrew, differentiated noticeably during the Iron Age (1200–540BCE), although in its earliest stages Biblical Hebrew was not highly differentiated from Ugaritic and the Canaanite of the Amarna letters.|$|E
5|$|The historiography of Vithoba and his cult {{is an area}} of {{continuing}} debate, even regarding his name. Various Indologists have proposed a <b>prehistory</b> for Vithoba worship where he was previously: a hero stone, a pastoral deity, a manifestation of Shiva, a Jain saint, or even all of these at various times for various devotees. Though the origins of both his cult and his main temple are likewise debated, there is clear evidence that they already existed by the 13th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{technology}} of oil transportation has evolved alongside the oil industry. Although human {{use of oil}} reaches to <b>prehistory,</b> the first modern commercial exploitation dates back to James Young's manufacture of paraffin in 1850. In the early 1850s, oil began to be exported from Upper Burma, then a British colony. The oil was moved in earthenware vessels to the river bank where it was then poured into boat holds for transportation to Britain.|$|E
5|$|Vere Gordon Childe (14 April 1892 – 19 October 1957), {{better known}} as V. Gordon Childe, was an Australian {{archaeologist}} and philologist who specialized {{in the study of}} European <b>prehistory.</b> Working most of his life as an academic in the United Kingdom for the University of Edinburgh and then the Institute of Archaeology, London, he wrote twenty-six books and was an early proponent of culture-historical archaeology and Marxist archaeology.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Egyptian deities are {{the gods}} and goddesses worshipped in ancient Egypt. The beliefs and rituals {{surrounding}} these gods formed the core of ancient Egyptian religion, which emerged sometime in <b>prehistory.</b> Deities represented natural forces and phenomena, and the Egyptians supported and appeased them through offerings and rituals so that these forces would continue to function according to maat, or divine order. After {{the founding of the}} Egyptian state around 3100BC, the authority to perform these tasks was controlled by the pharaoh, who claimed to be the gods' representative and managed the temples where the rituals were carried out.|$|E
5|$|Because {{language}} {{emerged in}} the early <b>prehistory</b> of man, before the existence of any written records, its early development has left no historical traces, and {{it is believed that}} no comparable processes can be observed today. Theories that stress continuity often look at animals to see if, for example, primates display any traits that can be seen as analogous to what pre-human language must have been like. And early human fossils can be inspected for traces of physical adaptation to language use or pre-linguistic forms of symbolic behaviour. Among the signs in human fossils that may suggest linguistic abilities are: the size of the brain relative to body mass, the presence of a larynx capable of advanced sound production and the nature of tools and other manufactured artifacts.|$|E
5|$|Botany {{originated}} in <b>prehistory</b> as herbalism with {{the efforts of}} early humans to identify – and later cultivate – edible, medicinal and poisonous plants, {{making it one of}} the oldest branches of science. Medieval physic gardens, often attached to monasteries, contained plants of medical importance. They were forerunners of the first botanical gardens attached to universities, founded from the 1540s onwards. One of the earliest was the Padua botanical garden. These gardens facilitated the academic study of plants. Efforts to catalogue and describe their collections were the beginnings of plant taxonomy, and led in 1753 to the binomial system of Carl Linnaeus that remains in use to this day.|$|E
5|$|For {{the inauguration}} of the CCP, a gala opening of the Golden Salakot, a pageant-drama of {{a story about the}} <b>prehistory</b> of the Philippines, {{occurred}} on September 8, 1969. The United States of America's President Nixon was invited but instead Ronald Reagan, California's Governor, along with his wife, flew to the country using the Air Force One for the event. There were accounts that the First Lady attempted to bring other celebrities through getting them tickets to ride the Air Force one but she was denied of this luxury by President Nixon. Accounts have also mentioned that this trip of the then California's Governor and wife led to the closeness of the Reagans and Marcoses.|$|E
5|$|In Greek {{literature}} {{he first}} {{appears as a}} great hunter in Homer's epic the Odyssey, where Odysseus sees his shade in the underworld. The bare bones of Orion's story are told by the Hellenistic and Roman collectors of myths, {{but there is no}} extant literary version of his adventures comparable, for example, to that of Jason in Apollonius of Rhodes' Argonautica or Euripides' Medea; the entry in Ovid's Fasti for May 11 is a poem on the birth of Orion, but that is one version of a single story. The surviving fragments of legend have provided a fertile field for speculation about Greek <b>prehistory</b> and myth.|$|E
5|$|Locusts {{have formed}} plagues since <b>prehistory.</b> The Ancient Egyptians carved {{them on their}} tombs and the insects are {{mentioned}} in the Iliad, the Bible and the Quran. Swarms have devastated crops and been a contributory cause of famines and human migrations. More recently, changes in agricultural practices and better surveillance of locations where swarms tend to originate, have meant that control measures can be used at an early stage. The traditional means of control {{are based on the}} use of insecticides from the ground or the air, but other methods using biological control are proving effective.|$|E
5|$|Sorting out his affairs, Childe donated most of {{his library}} {{and all of his}} estate to the Institute. After a holiday visiting archaeological sites in Gibraltar and Spain in February 1957, he sailed to Australia, {{reaching}} Sydney on his 65th birthday. Here, the University of Sydney, which had once barred him from working there, awarded him an honorary degree. Travelling around the country for six months, visiting family members and old friends, he was unimpressed by Australian society, believing it reactionary, increasingly suburban and uneducated. Looking into Australian <b>prehistory,</b> he found it a lucrative field for research, and lectured to archaeological and leftist groups on this and other topics, taking to Australian radio to attack academic racism towards Indigenous Australians.|$|E
