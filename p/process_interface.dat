50|$|A server {{program that}} {{implements}} a procedure in an interface {{is said to}} export the interface and a client program that calls procedures from an interface is said to import the interface. When writing a distributed application, a programmer first writes an interface definition using the IDL, then programmers can write the client program that imports the interface and the server program that exports the interface. The interface definition is processed using an IDL compiler to generate components that can be combined with client and server programs, without making any changes to the existing compilers. In particular, from an interface for each procedure in the interface, the appropriate marshalling and unmarshalling operations in each stub procedure and a header file that supports the data types in the interface definition. The header file {{is included in the}} source files of both the client and server programs, the client stub procedures are compiled and linked with the client program, and the server stub procedures are compiled and linked with the server program. An IDL compiler can be designed to <b>process</b> <b>interface</b> definitions for use with different languages, enabling clients and servers written in different languages to communicate using remote procedure calls.To achieve the goal of semantics transparency, designers have made RPC look like LPc using the concept of stubs that hide the actual RPC implementation from the programs the interface to the underlying RPC system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The idea of Business Process Management {{demands that}} {{companies}} change their focus from optimising tasks to focusing on whole business processes optimising the overall value chain. However process models depicting such complex processes {{are perceived as}} complicated and therefore as hard to use. The critical task is to present only relevant model parts to users {{and at the same}} time enable them to locate their contribution within the entire value chain. This paper discusses an approach for tailoring Event-driven Process Chains to those parts that are relevant to selected organisational units. The approach uses the allocation of organisational units to functions as a selection criteria for relevant model parts. A distinction between concurrent and alternative collaboration and the implementation of a corresponding notation within the EPC notation enable the introduction of additional <b>process</b> <b>interfaces,</b> a standard feature of Event-driven Process Chains, into the tailored models. The <b>process</b> <b>interfaces</b> ensure the visibility of the connected business process. Therefore the approach helps to resolve the depicted conflict. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to fill a {{research}} gap {{in the understanding of}} the involved mechanisms between the innovation process and creativity in a manufacturing company. In particular focus are the two innovation <b>process</b> <b>interfaces</b> between the technology development, product development and production departments and their influence on creativity and information flow. A conceptual framework is proposed, based on the combination of previous research in individual creativity and innovation process, to assess the influence via the innovation <b>process</b> <b>interfaces</b> on product knowledge and creative climate as creativity prerequisites. This study uses an explorative two single case study design with integrated triangulation and an abductive approach to fulfilling the research aim. These case studies took place in two Swedish manufacturing companies with a complete in-house innovation process using semi-structured interviews, two questionnaires and focus groups. The findings imply that the innovation process affects the basic prerequisites of individual creativity knowledge and creative climate due to its structural, strategic and physical implementation. Furthermore, the interfaces between the innovation sub-processes technology development, product development and production mediate the exchange of information between the involved departments. The results of this study adding valuable insights in this research field and propose further research including systems theory to achieve further in-depth understanding...|$|R

Reconfigurable devices have the advantages of reduced cost over their equivalent custom design, quick time to market {{and the ability to}} reconfigure the design at will and ease. One such reconfigurable device is an FPGA. In this industrial thesis, the design and implementation of a control <b>process</b> <b>interface</b> using ECP 2 M FPGA and PCIe communication is accomplished. This control <b>process</b> <b>interface</b> is designed and implemented for a 3 -D plotter system called LSC 11. In this thesis, the FPGA unit implemented drives the plotter device based on specific timing requirements charted by the customer. The FPGA unit is interfaced to a Host CPU in this thesis (through PCIe communication) for controlling the LSC 11 system using a custom software. All the peripherals required for the LSC 11 system such as the ADC, DAC, Quadrature decoder and the PWM unit are also implemented as part of this thesis. This thesis also implements an efficient methodology to send all the inputs of the LSC 11 system to the Host CPU without the necessity for issuing any cyclic read commands on the Host CPU. The RTL design is synthesised in FPGA and the system is verified for correctness and accuracy. The LSC 11 system design consumed 79 % of the total FPGA resources and the maximum clock frequency achieved was 130 Mhz. This thesis has been carried out at Abaxor Engineering GmbH, Germany.

40|$|Introduction Although {{it is not}} {{required}} by the specification, most Common Lisp implementations include a facility for multiple, independent threads of control (often called lightweight processes) within a single Lisp environment. Unfortunately, this facility is not standardized across the various implementations. Although the capabilities provided are very similar across implementations, the details of lightweight processes and the interface to them differ significantly. This situation {{makes it difficult to}} write programs that use lightweight processes and yet are portable across Common Lisp implementations. Common Lisp ILU does not requires lightweight processes in order to function, but they are useful. In particular, servers typically make heavy use of lightweight process facilities. The purpose of the ILU CL <b>Process</b> <b>Interface</b> is to provide a standardized, portable interface to lightweight processes for use w...|$|E
