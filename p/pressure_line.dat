40|$|An optimal <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> control {{algorithm}} was proposed for the fuel economy improvement of an AT-based parallel hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). By performing lever analysis at each gear step, the required <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> was obtained considering the torque ratio of the friction elements. In addition, the required <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> of the mode clutch was calculated. Based on these results, the optimal <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> map at each gear step of the EV and HEV modes was presented. Using the <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> map, an optimal <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> was performed for the AT input torque and mode. To investigate the proposed <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> {{control algorithm}}, a HEV performance simulator was developed based on the powertrain model of the target HEV, and fuel economy improvement was evaluated. Simulation results showed that as the gear step became higher, the optimal <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> control could reduce the hydraulic power loss, which gave a 2. 2 % fuel economy improvement compared to the existing <b>line</b> <b>pressure</b> control for the FTP- 72 mode...|$|R

50|$|In one {{hydraulic}} control variant the valve is opened passively by {{the thrust of}} the medium. In this case the discharge valve has a non-return function which prevents flowback from the <b>pressure</b> <b>line.</b> At the same time the high-densitiy solids are precompacted to close to the line pressure before the discharge valve opens.

40|$|Eight {{alternative}} methods for approximating salt creep and disposal room closure in a multiphase flow {{model of the}} Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) were implemented and evaluated: Three fixed-room geometries three porosity functions and two fluid-phase-salt methods. The pressure-time-porosity line interpolation method is the method used in current WIPP Performance Assessment calculations. The room closure approximation methods were calibrated against a series of room closure simulations performed using a creep closure code, SANCHO. The fixed-room geometries did not incorporate a direct coupling between room void volume and room pressure. The two porosity function methods that utilized moles of gas as an independent parameter for closure coupling. The capillary backstress method was unable to accurately simulate conditions of re-closure of the room. Two methods {{were found to be}} accurate enough to approximate the effects of room closure; the boundary backstress method and pressure-time-porosity line interpolation. The boundary backstress method is a more reliable indicator of system behavior due to a theoretical basis for modeling salt deformation as a viscous process. It is a complex method and a detailed calibration process is required. The <b>pressure</b> <b>lines</b> method is thought to be less reliable because the results were skewed towards SANCHO results in simulations where the sequence of gas generation was significantly different from the SANCHO gas-generation rate histories used for closure calibration. This limitation in the <b>pressure</b> <b>lines</b> method is most pronounced at higher gas-generation rates and is relatively insignificant at lower gas-generation rates. Due to its relative simplicity, the <b>pressure</b> <b>lines</b> method is easier to implement in multiphase flow codes and simulations have a shorter execution time...|$|R

When activated, the pump fills the air chambers of the jacket in order to pressurize the tissues in the limb, thereby forcing fluids, such as blood and lymph, out of the pressurized area.

5000|$|Line of action, <b>pressure</b> <b>line</b> : Line {{along which}} the force between two meshing gear teeth is directed. It {{has the same}} {{direction}} as the force vector. In general, the line of action changes from moment to moment during the period of engagement of a pair of teeth. For involute gears, however, the tooth-to-tooth force is always directed along the same line—that is, the line of action is constant. This implies that for involute gears the path of contact is also a straight line, coincident with the line of action—as is indeed the case.|$|E
