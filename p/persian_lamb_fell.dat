50|$|A Victorian {{mourning}} cap {{was identified}} by its black colour or tone (depending {{on the level}} of mourning). The more recent the loss the simpler the design. The shape of the cap depended on the age of the widow but the most common was peaked at the front.Widows caps, were either lisse, tulle or tarlatan, shape depending mainly on the age. Young widows wore mainly the Marie Stuart shape, but all widows' caps had long streamers. Their prices were various. Tarlatan could be home-made, but widows did not like home-made widows' caps because even though economical, they were ruined quicker than bought caps. It was smart to buy extra streamers and bows for them as they could be used at home to make morning caps,excellent thread and needles being used for the work. In summer a parasol was required which had to be of silk deeply trimmed with crape, almost covered with it, but lace and fringe was not allowed in the first year. Later mourning fringe could be used. A muff, had to be made of dark fur or of <b>Persian</b> <b>lamb.</b>|$|R
50|$|Very {{young or}} even fetal Karakul lambs are prized for pelts. Newborn karakul sheep pelts are called karakul (also spelled caracul), swakara (coined from South West Africa Karakul), {{astrakhan}} (Russian), <b>Persian</b> <b>lamb,</b> agnello di Persia, (Italian), krimmer (Russian) and garaköli bagana (Turkmen). Sometimes the terms for newborn lambs' and fetal lambs' pelts are used interchangeably. The newborn lambs have a tight, curly pattern of hair. The lambs must be under three days old {{when they are}} killed, or they will lose their black color and soft, tightly wound coils of fur. Dark colors are dominant and lambs often darken in color as they age. Fetal karakul lamb pelts are called broadtail, Breitschwanz (German), and karakulcha. Fetal karakul lambs are harvested through miscarriages, induced early delivery or by killing the mother sheep and removing the fetus. Rather than killing healthy female sheep, farmers will kill older sheep that have already given birth many times. People use the lamb pelts to create various clothing items, such as The Astrakhan (hat) or karakul hat. The pelts have also been used in haute couture.|$|R

5000|$|The Canadian {{military}} fur wedge cap, [...] "envelope busby", or colloquially [...] "The Astrakhan" [...] is {{a uniform}} hat {{worn by the}} Canadian military and RCMP. The outside of the cap is entirely covered in real (e.g. seal skin or <b>Persian</b> <b>lamb)</b> or synthetic fur and is shaped like a wedge. When not being worn the cap folds flat. The cap is about 8 in high but is normally worn with {{the apex of the}} wedge shape depressed back into the interior of the cap to form a longitudinal trough at the crown, reducing the overall height. Often the cap is patterned such that the front of the crown will be slightly higher than the back. On one side of the military style fur wedge cap hangs a flat flap made of cloth or wool that extends from the crown {{to the bottom of the}} cap, known as the [...] "bag". The colour of the [...] "bag" [...] was determined by the regimental colours (e.g. the RCMP bag was yellow). The bag is very similar to that worn with the busby.

Under the cliff the shade was cool and fresh; there was no wind; the sheep made good progress. But the broken line of shade crept inward toward the flock, and passed it. The sun beat down, and the wind arose. A red haze of fine sand eddied about the toiling sheep and shepherds. Piute trudged ahead leading the king-ram, old Socker, {{the leader of the}} flock; Mescal and Hare rode at the right, turning their faces from the sand-filled puffs of wind; August and Dave drove behind; Wolf, as always, took care of the stragglers. An hour went by without signs of distress; and with half the five-mile trip at his back August Naab's voice gathered cheer. The sun beat hotter. Another hour told a different story--the sheep labored; they had to be forced by urge of whip, by knees of horses, by Wolf's threatening bark. They stopped altogether during the frequent hot sand-blasts, and could not be driven. So time dragged. The flock straggled out to a long irregular line; rams refused to budge till they were ready; sheep lay down to rest; <b>lambs</b> <b>fell.</b> But there was an end to the belt of sand, and August Naab at last drove the lagging trailers out upon the stony bench.|$|R

The number of pieces of Hungarian <b>lamb</b> exported <b>fell</b> in the period examined, whilst the amount sold increased slightly. The average weight hardly changed. By 2005 prices had increased by 89. 5 % in comparison to 1998. Prices are steady in the lower weight categories with greater price fluctuations above 30 kg, increasing sales risk. During the period examined, the sales weight per one dam fell slightly, the modest rise in exports being due to increased numbers of dams coupled with deteriorating specific indicators. The highest prices are achieved at Christmas, the lowest in May. Prices fluctuate the most during the Easter period when supply is at its peak. Liberalisation of the lamb trade has not produced any fundamental change in domestic export, although the moderation of price rises may be an indirect effect. juhÃ¡gazat, bÃ¡rÃ¡nykereskedelem, Ã¡tlagsÃºly, Ã¡ringadozÃ¡s, termelési szerkezet, sheep sector, lamb trade, average weight, price fluctuation, production structure, International Relations/Trade, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R

Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 124, (1 - 2), 45 - 50. IMPF: 01. 55 RONO: 00 Sponsorship: EU monies through Farming Connect, the Welsh Assembly Government, Forestry Commission Wales and Environment Agency WalesStraw {{is widely used}} as a bedding material for housed sheep, but alternatives are needed in regions where straw is expensive or in short supply. The aim of this work was to compare time budgets, growth and food intake of growing, finishing lambs housed on either woodchip or straw bedding materials and also to evaluate the preferences shown by lambs when given a choice of bedding materials. One hundred and twenty-eight spring-born (approximately nine-month-old) Suffolk x Mule (Bluefaced Leicester x Welsh Speckled Face) and Charollais x Mule lambs (mean weight 35. 3 +/- 0. 28 kg) were randomly allocated within breed, sex and weight range to pens of four lambs and housed on either woodchip or straw. They were fed hay and concentrates ad libitum over an eighteen-day period. Lying, standing and eating behaviours were observed at 15 min intervals over 24 h on days 7 and 14 after housing. On day 17 the lambs were moved to the alternative bedding material and were observed for a further 48 h to assess the effects on time budgets of a novel bedding material in a familiar housed environment. Over all days, the proportions of observations when lambs were either lying, standing, eating hay or eating concentrates were 0. 69, 0. 15, 0. 07 and 0. 06 respectively {{and there were no}} significant effects of bedding material (P > 0. 05). On the first day after a change to the novel bedding material, the proportion of observations when <b>lambs</b> were lying <b>fell</b> by 6 % (P 0. 05). The 64 Suffolk x Mule lambs were then used in a preference test in which their use of bedding materials for various activities was observed every 15 min over four consecutive 12 hour days. Lambs used woodchip as a bedding material when lying or standing almost twice as often as straw (P 0. 05). There were no significant effects of either sex of lamb, day of observation or prior experience of the bedding materials on the preference for woodchip (all P > 0. 05). It is concluded that woodchip is a suitable alternative bedding material to straw, that is preferred by lambs over straw and is unlikely to affect lamb performance through changes in the proportion of time spent lying, standing or eating.
