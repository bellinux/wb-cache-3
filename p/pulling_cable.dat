50|$|Ducts can be {{purchased}} {{with a variety of}} options or features. One such enhancement is pre-lubrication. Pre-lubricated ducts may be either permanently impregnated with anti-friction compounds or coated with liquid lubricant during manufacture (see GR-3155). This may or may not eliminate the need for supplementary lubrication when <b>pulling</b> <b>cable</b> into the duct. Before using a supplementary lubricant with a pre-lubricated duct, the user should check with the manufacturer to determine if the added lubricant is compatible with the pre-lubricated surface of the duct. Failure to do this may result in the cable seizing up rather than reducing the friction coefficient of the duct.|$|E

40|$|Managing {{supply chain}} is {{important}} for every organization because {{it has become a}} major element in a global economy. The supply chain is a primary system that moves the products or services from supplier to customer. Poor performance in delivering the services will essentially affect customer satisfaction. Previous studies have shown the effects of supplier selection on the organization performance in the services or products delivery. This research focuses on civil infrastructure and <b>pulling</b> <b>cable</b> suppliers in one of the telecommunication players in Malaysia and also on its supplier selection procedure, which is known as Price Rate Table (PRT). This paper initially reviewed the concepts of PRT pool and PRT zoning. We then assessed the level of staff satisfaction on PRT and also its advantages and disadvantages in terms of project performance. This assessment was conducted qualitatively via semi structured interview to a specific project team in the organization. Results showed that for small projects the PRT concept has offered more advantages than disadvantages in terms of project performance. On the other hand, the disadvantages are emphasized more for mega and urgent projects. In this paper, we proposed two selection processes to overcome the issues and also evaluated the processes using strategy canvas. Only the best selection process upon the highest accumulated point obtained is recommended to be adopted in the current organization...|$|E
40|$|Long, {{flexible}} deployable {{structures are}} used in space exploration vehicles in low-gravity environment applications (Puig et al. Tibert and Pellegrino). The use of {{the same types of}} probes in the exploration of planets with a large gravitational field would be of interest to reach regions of scientific interest of difficult access, such as cliff sides and terrain slopes. Vibration control in this case is a sensitive issue that can be addressed by the use of a reliable model of dynamics of the long exploration probe. The present work addresses the problem of building a simple dynamic model of a long beam deformed by a tip <b>pulling</b> <b>cable.</b> The simple model is sought for future use in a vibrations control strategy. The exact static deformation shape of a long beam is obtained through the solution of the nonlinear beam governing differential equations. The exact deformed configuration for beams with a uniform cross section and transversal end load is found through the recursive solution of elliptic integrals (Frish–Fay and Timoshenko and Gere). The deformed configuration of beams with an inclined pulling force can be found via numerical approximations, using adequate methods such as the Runge–Kutta (Ohtsuki and Shvartsman), the shooting method (Holland et al.), the finite element method (Howell), and the quasi-linearization finite difference method (Al-Sadder and Al-Rawi). A strategy to calculate the static deformation of a long beam pulled by a tip cable is summarized in the work of Yau. The dynamic behavior of the long beam can be obtained through the analysis of small vibration about the static equilibrium of a finite elements model of the structure (Ferris and Afonta, Sallstrom et al. and Santillan et al.). Vibration analysis and experimental validation of a finely meshed finite element model of a tip pulled beam was carried out by Holland et al. The present work proposes the combination of a nonlinear static deformation model of the same structure and a courser finite element model of the deformed beam in order to assess its dynamic characteristics. Results of the different modeling strategies are compared and discussed...|$|E

50|$|The {{rehabilitation}} used {{a single}} wire thickness (2 in diameter galvanized helical 91-wire strands.) to facilitate fabricating and installing the cables more quickly. New concrete anchorages {{with up to}} 30 ft long anchor rods were built by Cianbro. Crews installed continuous runs of strands on new saddles bolted and welded on new base plates atop cable bents and the main towers. Workers placed two groups of four strands 12 ft above each main cable to allow for pulls. Each strand weighs 4 tons (3.6 metric tons). A rope pull was walked across, connected to a 7/8 in <b>pull</b> <b>cable,</b> then winched back across and connected to the strand, which was fed through a tensioner holding back about 15000 lb to smooth the pull.|$|R
50|$|The system {{consists}} of three types of stations: Power Stations with 135 hp (101 kW) electric motors, powering one or both connecting sections. Terminal stations in Forsby and Köping where the limestone was loaded/unloaded also functioned as power stations. Angle stations lack motors and only change {{the angle of the}} cable track by splicing together two sections powered from their respective other sides. Station buildings have an iron frame, wooden walls and roof constructed from asbestos cement. The <b>pulling</b> <b>cables</b> go in endless loops between stations, and kept taut by counterweights in towers in the power stations. The heavier carrying cable is divided into four runs along each section, connected by tension stations. These stations are comparatively small, simple structures regulating cable tension along the way.|$|R
