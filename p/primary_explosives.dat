50|$|EBWs {{have found}} uses outside nuclear weapons, {{such as the}} Titan IV, safety {{conscious}} applications where stray electrical currents might detonate normal blasting caps, and applications requiring very precise timing for multiple point commercial blasting in mines or quarries. EBW detonators are much safer than regular electric detonators because unlike regular detonators EBWs do not have <b>primary</b> <b>explosives.</b> <b>Primary</b> <b>explosives</b> such as lead azide {{are very sensitive to}} static electricity, radio frequency, shock etc.|$|E
50|$|Priming {{compositions}} are <b>primary</b> <b>explosives</b> {{mixed with}} other compositions to control (lessen) {{the sensitivity of}} the mixture to the desired property.|$|E
50|$|Solid pack {{electric}} {{blasting caps}} use a thin bridgewire in direct contact (hence solid pack) with a <b>primary</b> <b>explosive,</b> which is heated by electric current and causes the detonation of the <b>primary</b> <b>explosive.</b> That <b>primary</b> <b>explosive</b> then detonates a larger charge of secondary explosive.|$|R
50|$|A: <b>Primary</b> <b>explosive</b> {{substance}} (1.1A).|$|R
50|$|Conventional {{blasting}} caps use electricity to heat a bridge wire rather than vaporize it, and that heating then causes the <b>primary</b> <b>explosive</b> to detonate. Imprecise {{contact between the}} bridgewire and the <b>primary</b> <b>explosive</b> changes how quickly the explosive is heated up, and minor electrical variations in the wire or leads will change how quickly it heats up as well. The heating process typically takes milliseconds to tens of milliseconds to complete and initiate detonation in the <b>primary</b> <b>explosive.</b> This is roughly 1,000 to 10,000 times longer and less precise than the EBW electrical vaporization.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>explosives</b> are {{extremely}} sensitive to mechanical shock, friction, and heat, {{to which they}} will respond by burning rapidly or detonating.|$|E
50|$|For example, <b>primary</b> <b>explosives</b> are so {{sensitive}} {{that they need}} to be stored and shipped in a wet state to prevent accidental initiation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>explosives</b> {{are often}} used in {{detonators}} or to trigger larger charges of less sensitive secondary explosives. <b>Primary</b> <b>explosives</b> are commonly used in blasting caps and percussion caps to translate a physical shock signal. In other situations, different signals such as electrical/physical shock, or, {{in the case of}} laser detonation systems, light, are used to initiate an action, i.e., an explosion. A small quantity, usually milligrams, is sufficient to initiate a larger charge of explosive that is usually safer to handle.|$|E
50|$|The {{substance}} exhibits blasting properties, {{therefore it}} is sometimes use as a <b>primary</b> <b>explosive.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{secondary}} explosive is less sensitive than a <b>primary</b> <b>explosive</b> and requires substantially more energy to be initiated. Because {{they are less}} sensitive, they are usable in {{a wider variety of}} applications and are safer to handle and store. Secondary explosives are used in larger quantities in an explosive train and are usually initiated by a smaller quantity of a <b>primary</b> <b>explosive.</b>|$|R
50|$|Match type {{blasting}} caps use an electric match (insulating sheet with electrodes on both sides, a thin bridgewire soldered across the sides, all dipped in ignition and output mixes) {{to initiate the}} <b>primary</b> <b>explosive,</b> rather than direct contact between the bridgewire and the <b>primary</b> <b>explosive.</b> The match can be manufactured separately {{from the rest of}} the cap and only assembled at the end of the process.|$|R
50|$|A primary {{explosive}} is an explosive that is extremely sensitive to stimuli such as impact, friction, heat, static electricity, or electromagnetic radiation. Some <b>primary</b> <b>explosives</b> are {{also known as}} contact explosives. A relatively small amount of energy is required for initiation. As a very general rule, <b>primary</b> <b>explosives</b> {{are considered to be}} those compounds that are more sensitive than PETN. As a practical measure, <b>primary</b> <b>explosives</b> are sufficiently sensitive that they can be reliably initiated with a blow from a hammer; however, PETN can also usually be initiated in this manner, so this is only a very broad guideline. Additionally, several compounds, such as nitrogen triiodide, are so sensitive that they cannot even be handled without detonating. Nitrogen triiodide is so sensitive that it can be reliably detonated by exposure to alpha radiation; it is the only explosive for which this is true.|$|E
5000|$|... 4 {{operational}} timing devices {{designed to}} detonate <b>primary</b> <b>explosives,</b> consisting of small black boxes containing circuit boards connected to Casio watches and 9-volt battery connectors.|$|E
50|$|Fulminic {{acid and}} its salts (fulminates), for {{instance}} mercury fulminate, are very dangerous, {{and are often}} used as detonators for other explosive materials, and are examples of <b>primary</b> <b>explosives.</b> The vapors also are toxic.|$|E
50|$|Platinum {{fulminate}} is a <b>primary</b> <b>explosive</b> {{which is}} a fulminate salt of platinum discovered by Edmund Davy.|$|R
5|$|Mercury(II) {{fulminate}} is a <b>primary</b> <b>explosive</b> {{which is}} mainly {{used as a}} primer of a cartridge in firearms.|$|R
50|$|High-explosives trains can {{be either}} two-step (e.g., {{detonator}} and dynamite) or three-step (e.g., detonator, booster of <b>primary</b> <b>explosive,</b> and main charge of secondary explosive).|$|R
5000|$|Ammonium nitrate is not, on its own, an {{explosive}}, [...] but it readily forms {{explosive mixtures}} with varying properties {{when combined with}} <b>primary</b> <b>explosives</b> such as azides or with fuels such as aluminum powder or fuel oil.|$|E
50|$|Amatol {{should not}} be stored in {{containers}} made from copper or brass, as it can form unstable compounds sensitive to vibration. Pressed, it is relatively insensitive but may be detonated by severe impact, whereas when cast, it is extremely insensitive. <b>Primary</b> <b>explosives</b> such as mercury fulminate were often used as a detonator, in combination with an explosive booster charge such as tetryl.|$|E
50|$|If {{detonators}} with <b>primary</b> <b>explosives</b> are used, {{the shock}} {{wave of the}} initiating blast may set off the detonator and the attached charge. However even relatively insensitive explosives can be set off if their shock sensitivity is sufficient. Depending on the location, the shock wave can be transported by air, ground, or water. The process is probabilistic, a radius with 50% probability of sympathetic detonation often being used for quantifying the distances involved.|$|E
5000|$|Hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD) is a [...] high {{explosive}} organic compound. The theorized structure lent itself well to acting as an initiating, or <b>primary</b> <b>explosive.</b> While still quite sensitive to shock and friction, it was relatively stable {{compared to other}} initiating explosives of the time, such as mercury fulminate, and proved to be relatively inexpensive and easy to synthesise. As such, it was quickly taken up as a <b>primary</b> <b>explosive</b> in mining applications. However, it has since been superseded by even more stable compounds such as tetryl.|$|R
50|$|Detonators are {{hazardous}} for untrained {{personnel to}} handle since they contain <b>primary</b> <b>explosive.</b> They are sometimes not recognized as explosives {{due to their}} appearance, leading to injuries.|$|R
50|$|A {{blasting}} cap {{is a small}} sensitive <b>primary</b> <b>explosive</b> device generally used to detonate a larger, more powerful and less sensitive secondary explosive such as TNT, dynamite, or plastic explosive.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} use of PETN is as an {{explosive}} with high brisance. It {{is more difficult}} to detonate than <b>primary</b> <b>explosives,</b> so dropping or igniting it will typically not cause an explosion (at atmospheric pressure it is difficult to ignite and burns relatively slowly), but is more sensitive to shock and friction than other secondary explosives such as TNT or tetryl. Under certain conditions a deflagration to detonation transition can occur.|$|E
50|$|Many picrates are explosives, {{for example}} {{ammonium}} picrate (known as Dunnite). Some {{are used as}} <b>primary</b> <b>explosives,</b> namely lead picrate or potassium picrate which find their use as primers for cartridge ammunition. Picrates of some metals tend to be significantly more sensitive to impact, friction and shock than picric acid itself. As a result, storage of picric acid (or mixtures containing it) in metal containers is strongly discouraged due to the high risk of accidental explosion.|$|E
50|$|A contact {{explosive}} is {{a chemical}} substance that explodes violently {{when it is}} exposed to a relatively small amount of energy (friction, pressure, sound, light). Though different substances have varying amounts of energy sensitivity, they are all much more sensitive relative to other explosives. Contact explosives {{are a part of}} a group of explosives called <b>primary</b> <b>explosives</b> which are also very sensitive to stimuli but not to the degree of contact explosives. The extreme sensitivity of contact explosives is due to either its composition, bonds, or structure.|$|E
50|$|B: An article {{containing}} a <b>primary</b> <b>explosive</b> substance and not containing {{two or more}} effective protective features. Some articles, such as detonator assemblies for blasting and primers, cap-type, are included. (1.1B, 1.2B, 1.4B).|$|R
50|$|Potassium picrate, or {{potassium}} 2,4,6-trinitrophenolate, is {{an organic}} chemical, a picrate of potassium. It is a reddish yellow or green crystalline material. It is a <b>primary</b> <b>explosive.</b> Anhydrous potassium picrate forms orthorhombic crystals.|$|R
5000|$|AgN3, {{like most}} heavy metal azides, is a {{dangerous}} <b>primary</b> <b>explosive.</b> Decomposition can be triggered by exposure to ultraviolet light or by impact. Ceric ammonium nitrate is used as an oxidising agent to destroy [...] in spills.|$|R
5000|$|Explosive {{materials}} may {{be categorized}} by {{the speed at}} which they expand. Materials that detonate (the front of the chemical reaction moves faster through the material than the speed of sound) are said to be [...] "high explosives" [...] and materials that deflagrate are said to be [...] "low explosives". Explosives may also be categorized by their sensitivity. Sensitive materials that can be initiated by a relatively small amount of heat or pressure are <b>primary</b> <b>explosives</b> and materials that are relatively insensitive are secondary or tertiary explosives.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, PETN {{was most}} {{importantly}} used in exploding-bridgewire detonators for the atomic bombs. These exploding-bridgewire detonators gave more precise detonation, compared with primacord. PETN {{was used for}} these detonators because it was safer than <b>primary</b> <b>explosives</b> like lead azide: while it was sensitive, it would not detonate below a threshold amount of energy. Exploding bridgewires containing PETN remain used in current nuclear weapons. In spark detonators, PETN is used to avoid the need for primary explosives; the energy needed for a successful direct initiation of PETN by an electric spark ranges between 10-60 mJ.|$|E
50|$|At {{a purely}} {{technical}} level, a sufficiently large detonator would initiate high explosives {{without the need}} for a booster charge. However, there are very good reasons why this method is never used. Firstly, there is a major safety issue, i.e. detonators are (like all <b>primary</b> <b>explosives)</b> much more sensitive to shock, heat, and friction than an explosive booster. Therefore, minimising the amount of primary explosive that users must store or carry greatly reduces the likelihood of serious accidents. An additional economic reason for using explosive booster charges is that chemical compounds used in detonators (e.g. lead styphnate) are comparatively expensive to produce and encapsulate when compared to the manufacturing costs of explosive boosters.|$|E
50|$|A fuze {{may contain}} only the {{electronic}} or mechanical elements necessary to signal or actuate the detonator, but some fuzes contain {{a small amount}} of <b>primary</b> <b>explosive</b> to initiate the detonation. Fuzes for large explosive charges may include an explosive booster.|$|R
50|$|Lead styphnate {{is mainly}} used in small arm {{ammunition}} for military and commercial applications. It {{serves as a}} <b>primary</b> <b>explosive</b> with gunpowder, which will not ignite upon a simple impact. Lead styphnate is also used as primer in microthrusters for small satellite stationkeeping.|$|R
50|$|Cyanuric triazide (C3N12 or (NCN3)3) is {{described}} as an environmentally friendly, low toxicity, and organic <b>primary</b> <b>explosive</b> with a detonation velocity of about 7,300 m·s−1, and ignition temperature at 205 °C. Primary research on this compound focuses on its use as a high energy density compound.|$|R
