This present study gauged efficiency gains that could be achieved by implementing a split-night protocol within the laboratory. Results demonstrate improved technical efficiency by at least 15 %, reducing time to treatment for the most severe cases and increasing patient throughput within the clinic. With over 56 000 sleep studies carried out annually, this technique has significant utility in evidence-based practice. A. G. Elshaug, J. R. Moss and A. M. Southcot...|$|R
