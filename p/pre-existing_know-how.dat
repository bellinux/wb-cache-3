40|$|Abstract â€” Traditional {{approaches}} to integrating knowledge into neural network are concerned mainly about supervised learning. This paper presents how {{a family of}} self-organizing neural models known as Fusion Architecture for Learning, COgnition and Navigation(FALCON) can incorporate a priori knowledge and perform knowledge refinement and expansion through reinforcement learning. Symbolic rules are formulated based on <b>pre-existing</b> <b>know-how</b> and inserted into FALCON as a priori knowledge. The availability of knowledge enables FALCON to start performing earlier in the initial learning trials. Through a temporal-difference (TD) learning method, the inserted rules can be refined and expanded according to the evaluative feedback signals received from the environment. Our experimental results based on a minefield navigation task have shown that FALCON is able to learn much faster and attain {{a higher level of}} performance earlier when inserted with the appropriate a priori knowledge.

One major part of this work {{is the creation of}} a comprehensive tool set of simulation models integrating all fields of expertise involved. The objective is to create, test and apply an integrated simulation tool set that allows to simulate and evaluate the interaction between vehicle traffic, vehicular communication and co-operative applications. Each of these three areas is treated by dedicated models. Additionally the environmental effects are modelled by a separate modelling approach with detailed algorithms for vehicle dynamics and engine behaviour. The process to arrive at such a model combination from user requirements over <b>pre-existing</b> <b>know-how</b> and other significant steps are described as well as the current status of the work...|$|E
40|$|When researching {{new product}} ideas or filing new patents, inventors need to {{retrieve}} all relevant <b>pre-existing</b> <b>know-how</b> and/or to exploit and enforce patents in their technological domain. However, {{this process is}} hindered by lack of richer metadata, which if present, would allow more powerful concept-based search to complement the current keywordbased approach. This paper presents our approach to automatic patent enrichment, tested in large-scale, parallel experiments on USPTO and EPO documents. It starts by defining the metadata annotation task and examines its challenges. The text analysis tools are presented next, including details on automatic annotation of sections, references and measurements. The key challenges encountered were dealing with ambiguities and errors in the data; creation and maintenance of large, domain-independent dictionaries; and building an efficient, robust patent analysis pipeline, capable of dealing with terabytes of data. The accuracy of automatically created metadata is evaluated against a human-annotated gold standard, with results of over 90 % on most annotation types...|$|E
