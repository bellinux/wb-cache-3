Slime molds used as food source by slugs include Stemonitis axifera and Symphytocarpus flaccidus. Some slugs are selective towards certain parts or developmental stages of the fungi they eat, though this is very variable. Depending on the species and other factors, slugs eat only fungi at specific stages of development. Moreover, in other cases, whole mushrooms can be eaten, without any selection or bias towards ontogenetic stages.|$|E
500|$|Boletus edulis (English: <b>penny</b> <b>bun,</b> cep, porcino or porcini) is a {{basidiomycete}} fungus, and {{the type}} species of the genus Boletus. Widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere across Europe, Asia, and North America, it does not occur naturally in the Southern Hemisphere, {{although it has been}} introduced to southern Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. Several closely related European mushrooms formerly thought to be varieties or forms of B.edulis have been shown using molecular phylogenetic analysis to be distinct species, and others previously classed as separate species are [...] with this species. The western North American species commonly known as the California king bolete (Boletus edulis var. grandedulis) is a large, darker-coloured variant first formally identified in 2007.|$|E
500|$|Common {{names for}} B. edulis vary by region. The {{standard}} Italian name, porcino (pl. porcini), means fungo porcino, in Italian, echoes the term suilli, literally [...] "hog mushrooms", a term {{used by the}} Ancient Romans and still in use in southern Italian terms for this species. The derivation has been ascribed to the resemblance of young fruit bodies to piglets, or to the fondness pigs have for eating them. It {{is also known as}} [...] "king bolete". The English <b>penny</b> <b>bun</b> refers to its rounded brownish shape. The German name Steinpilz (stone mushroom) refers to the species' firm flesh. In Austria, it is called Herrenpilz, the [...] "noble mushroom", while in Mexico, the Spanish name is panza, meaning [...] "belly". Another Spanish name, rodellon, means [...] "small round boulder", while the Dutch name eekhoorntjesbrood means [...] "squirrel's bread". Russian names are belyy grib ("white mushroom" [...] as opposed to less valuable [...] "black mushrooms") and borovik (from bor—"pine forest").|$|E

6000|$|I can't {{honestly}} {{say that we}} made much progress at our first meeting. It was Brown's fault. He would begin by telling us {{a story about a}} dog. It was the old, old story of the dog {{who had been in the}} habit of going every morning to a certain baker's shop with a penny in his mouth, in exchange for which he always received a <b>penny</b> <b>bun.</b> One day, the baker, thinking he would not know the difference, tried to palm off upon the poor animal a ha'penny bun, whereupon the dog walked straight outside and fetched in a policeman. Brown had heard this chestnut for the first time that afternoon, and was full of it. It is always a mystery to me where Brown has been for the last hundred years. He stops you in the street with, [...] "Oh, I must tell you!--such a capital story!"

As I turned into a road that led toward a hill, a little boy, riding a {{dapple-gray}} pony, and an old lady on a white horse, with bells ringing somewhere, trotted by me, followed by a little girl, who wished to know where she could buy a <b>penny</b> <b>bun.</b> I told her the best were at Newmarch's, in Bedford Street, and she ran on, much pleased; but I'm afraid she never found that best of bake-shops. I was going quietly along, when the sound of another horse coming made me look round; and there I saw a dreadful sight,--a wild horse, tearing over the ground, with fiery eyes and streaming tail. On his back sat a crazy man, beating him with a broom; a crazy woman was behind him, with her bonnet on wrong side before, holding one crazy child in her lap, while another stood on the horse; a third was hanging on by one foot, and all were howling {{at the top of their}} voices as they rushed by. I scrambled over the wall to get out of the way, and there I saw more curious sights. Two blind men were sitting on the grass, trying to see two lame men who were hobbling along as hard as they could; and, near by, a bull was fighting a bee in the most violent manner. This rather alarmed me; and I scrambled back into the road again, just as a very fine lady jumped over a barberry-bush near by, and a gentleman went flying after, with a ring in one hand and a stick in the other.|$|E

50|$|The {{vegetation}} of {{the area}} is divided into layers like any natural habitat in the temperate climatic zone. On the field layer are mosses and fungi (<b>penny</b> <b>bun</b> or cep, honey fungus), in addition there is the herbaceous layer, which is characterized by various species depending on the season. In spring when the soil is warmed up quickly by sunlight, spring flowers like hepatica appear, which conjure up blue carpets on the forest floor, followed by anemone. As the temperatures rise, leaves sprout on the trees. The level of sunlight under the trees reduces and species such as Spring Vetchling, Lily of the Valley, May Lily, Moschatel, Herb Paris and Woodruff appear, which flourish under conditions of low light. As the foliage becomes denser, shade-loving summer flowers appear. The first ones are the remaining native orchids of our deciduous forests. On the Streckelsberg: Common Twayblade, Lesser Butterfly-orchid, Bird's-nest Orchid and Red helleborine. Rather less colourful summer flowers in the beech woods are the Small Balsam, Common Figwort, Wood Avens, Wall Lettuce, Baneberry and Enchanter's-nightshade. Characteristic grasses of the herbaceous layer of the beech forest are False Brome, Wood Melick and Giant Fescue. The overlying shrub layer consists of bushes and saplings, such as Elder, Rowan, Fly Honeysuckle, Common Honeysuckle, Dewberry, Raspberry, Blackthorn, Common Ivy, Alpine Currant, Hazel, Goat Willow, Bird Cherry, three species of wild rose, Common Buckthorn and Viburnum. There are also young trees of the species Norway Maple, Sycamore and Silver Birch.

40|$|The study {{evaluated}} the antioxidant, antihyperglycemic and antimicrobial effects of both ethanolic and hydromethanolic extracts of the fruiting bodies of wild edible mushrooms Boletus edulis (<b>penny</b> <b>bun)</b> and Cantharellus cibarius (golden chanterelle) sampled in Poiana Stampei (Suceava county, Romania). The total phenolic contents of extracts were also determined. Boletus edulis hydromethanolic extract showed the highest total phenolic content (72. 78 ± 0. 29 mg/g). This extract {{was also the}} most active as scavenger of DPPH and ABTS radicals (EC 50 = 151. 44 ± 0. 85 and 65. 4 ± 0. 4 µg/mL, respectively) and reducing agent (EC 50 = 46. 77 ± 0. 34 µg/mL). Cantharellus cibarius ethanolic extract showed high ferrous ion chelating (EC 50 = 82. 9 ± 0. 6 µg/mL), 15 -lipoxygenase (EC 50 = 236. 7 ± 1. 5 µg/mL) and α-glucosidase (EC 50 = 9. 77 ± 0. 06 μg/mL) inhibitory activities. For both mushrooms, the ethanolic extracts were more active against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 than the hydromethanolic ones. The antioxidant and antihyperglycemic effects revealed in this study support further investigations for a possible valorization of both mushrooms in the dietary supplement and pharmaceutical industries...|$|E
40|$|The present thesis {{investigates the}} {{reciprocal}} relationship between metals and wild-growing macromycetes. An inter-diciplinary approach was {{needed in order}} to reveal, on the molecular level, how these organisms respond to, and are affected by, potentially toxic metals. This was accomplished by applying a selection of techniques from the fields of analytical chemistry and molecular biology. Samples were collected in the years 1998, 2000, and 2002 near two metal smelters: the still active Outokumpu Norzink zinc (Zn) smelter at Odda, S. W. Norway and the former copper (Cu) smelter at Sulitjelma, N. Norway. In the 1998 collection round, reference samples were collected several km from the emission sources. For subsequent rounds of sampling, reference samples were collected from rural areas in Central Norway. Atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS, flame mode) and high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HR-ICP-MS) were used to determine cadmium (Cd), Zn, and Cu in soil and fruiting body tissues. Mercury (Hg) was determined in samples collected at Odda and the reference areas in Central Norway, by cold vapour atomic fluorescence spectrometry (CVAFS). Cytosolic compounds were separated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC, =gel permeation chromatography) and anion exchange chromatography, and distribution of endogenous metals was investigated by AAS and CVAFS. Parallel runs of samples spiked with the radiotracer 109 Cd were performed to further study binding of Cd to cytosolic components. Cd-binding proteins from the fly agaric (Amanita muscaria) were analyzed with respect to amino acid composition, whereas the N terminal amino acid sequence was determined for a Cd-binding protein from the king bolete (<b>penny</b> <b>bun,</b> Boletus edulis). Cd-binding components from cytosolic extracts, separated by SEC, were further separated and characterized by highperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) Cytosolic Cd-binding capacity (CCBC) was determined, to investigate whether increased synthesis of metal-binding compounds is part of the direct defense against metal toxicity in macromycetes. Furthermore, cytosolic extracts of B. edulis were analyzed with respect to activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), two enzymes important in the cellular defense against free radicals. In the same species, heat shock protein 70 kDa (HSP 70, a molecular chaperone), as well as concentrations of glutathione (GSHTOT=GSH + 0. 5 GSSG) and free proline were determined. Two markers of oxidative damage to cellular molecules were determined in B. edulis, in order to make possible conclusions about the effectiveness of the defense systems expressed in this species in handling the increased metal toxicity. These markers were frequency of apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites in DNA and concentration of lipid hydroperoxides. The results showed elevated concentrations of Cd, Zn, and Cu in surface soil close to both smelters. Hg was elevated near the Outokumpu Norzink Zn smelter at Odda (not determined at Sulitjelma, see above). Metal concentrations in fruiting body tissues were more dependent on species-specific accumulation potentials for metals than on metal concentrations in substrate. Determinations of amino acid composition of Cd-binding proteins of A. muscaria, revealed that these compounds do not belong to the metallothionein (MT) family. The same applies to a Cd-binding protein from B. edulis. HPLC-MS demonstrated the presence of phytochelatins (PCs) in B. edulis growing near the Zn smelter at Odda. This is the first report of PCs in a macromycete. CCBC correlated quite well with exposure to Cd, Zn, Hg, and Cu in 42 samples of B. edulis (Spearman’s p< 0. 001 for all four metals). Furthermore, the difference in CCBC between the exposed group (growing near the Zn smelter at Odda) and the reference group was also statistically significant (Mann Whitney’s p< 0. 001), indicating the induction of Cd-binding cytosolic compounds as a response to metal exposure in this species. In 48 samples of B. edulis, expressions of SOD, CAT, and HSP 70 were significantly positively correlated to the degree of exposure (Spearman’s p< 0. 01 for the association between Cd and SOD, p< 0. 001 for all other correlations between SOD, CAT, or HSP 70 on one side and Cd, Zn, Hg, or Cu on the other). These results indicate that toxic effects arising from metal exposure, are not effectively alleviated by direct defense mechanisms (e. g. PCs) alone. GSHTOT correlated negatively with exposure, suggesting that the intracellular pool of GSH is reduced as a result of PC synthesis. Determination of frequency of AP sites and concentration of lipid hydroperoxides in 31 fruiting bodies of B. edulis showed that both damage parameters were significantly elevated in the exposed group (growing near the Zn smelter at Odda) relative to the reference group (p< 0. 001). Furthermore, the two damage parameters correlated significantly positively with exposure to the four metals (p< 0. 05) and with each other (p< 0. 001). From this, it is concluded that although a host of direct and indirect defense mechanisms is induced against metal toxicity in B. edulis, damage to vital cellular components do occur. Dr. philos.
