50|$|Epicyclic <b>gearing</b> or <b>planetary</b> <b>gearing</b> is a {{gear system}} {{consisting}} {{of one or}} more outer gears, or planet gears, revolving about a central, or sun gear. Typically, the planet gears are mounted on a movable arm or carrier, which itself may rotate relative to the sun gear. Epicyclic gearing systems also incorporate the use of an outer ring gear or annulus, which meshes with the planet <b>gears.</b> <b>Planetary</b> <b>gears</b> (or epicyclic gears) are typically classified as simple or compound <b>planetary</b> <b>gears.</b> Simple <b>planetary</b> <b>gears</b> have one sun, one ring, one carrier, and one planet set. Compound <b>planetary</b> <b>gears</b> involve {{one or more of the}} following three types of structures: meshed-planet (there are at least two more planets in mesh with each other in each planet train), stepped-planet (there exists a shaft connection between two planets in each planettrain), and multi-stage structures (the system contains two or more planet sets). Compared to simple <b>planetary</b> <b>gears,</b> compound <b>planetary</b> <b>gears</b> have the advantages of larger reduction ratio, higher torque-to-weight ratio, and more ﬂexible conﬁgurations.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel general system-structure coupling dynamic analysis procedure to comprehensively analyze the dynamic performance of <b>planetary</b> <b>gears.</b> The novel coupling dynamic analysis takes dynamic loads of gears as excitations for structure dynamic analysis. Considering the time-varying mesh stiffness of gears, torsional stiffness of carrier and support stiffness of bearings, the system dynamic model of <b>planetary</b> <b>gears</b> is built by using lumped parameter method. Vibration modes and natural frequencies of <b>planetary</b> <b>gears</b> are investigated through modal analysis. Furthermore, system dynamic response is analyzed under various working conditions.

In every analysis step, if dynamic performance criteria are not satisfied, the <b>planetary</b> <b>gears</b> model should be redesigned according to dynamic analysis results...|$|R

The 5/8 horsepower 28 Volts DC motor is mounted on the turret bracket and drives the drum cam through a flexible shaft in order to isolate it from the weapon's recoil.

2500|$|The 45RFE and 545RFE {{automatic}} transmission in the WJ was notable. It included three <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> sets {{rather than the}} two normally used in a four-speed automatic. This gave it six theoretical speeds, {{and it would have}} been the first six-speed transmission ever produced in volume, but it was programmed to only use five of these ratios. Four were used for upshifts, with a different second gear for downshifts. Although five of the six ratios were used, Chrysler decided to call it a [...] "4-speed automatic". In 2001, the programming was changed to make use of all six ratios. Rather than have six forward gears, the transmission was programmed to act as a five-speed with the alternate second gear for downshifts. The rpm at [...] on a 545RFE is 2000 rpm, 200 rpm less than the 45RFE programming. 1999 and 2000 model year WJ owners can have their 45RFE transmission's programming flashed to enable the extra gear as both transmissions are physically the same. (Must purchase new PCM and ABS module and program them with a fake VIN to make this work.) The 42RE 4-speed automatic remained the transmission for the Inline 6 engine.
