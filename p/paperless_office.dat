50|$|The {{concept of}} {{developing}} a flexible display was first put forth by Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Company). In 1974, Nicholas K. Sheridon, a PARC employee, made a major breakthrough in flexible display technology and produced the first flexible e-paper display. Dubbed Gyricon, this new display technology was designed to mimic the properties of paper, but married with the capacity to display dynamic digital images. Sheridon envisioned the advent of <b>paperless</b> <b>offices</b> and sought commercial applications for Gyricon. In 2003 Gyricon LLC was formed as a direct subsidiary of Xerox to commercialize the electronic paper technology developed at Xerox PARC. Gyricon LLC's operations were short lived and in December 2005 Xerox closed the subsidiary company in a move to focus on licensing the technology instead.|$|R

40|$|Electronic mail, or e-mail, {{has brought}} us a big step closer towards the vision of <b>paperless</b> <b>offices.</b> To advance even closer to this vision, however, it is {{essential}} that existing e-mail systems be enhanced with value-added services which are capable of replacing many of the human procedures established in pen and paper communications. One of the most important and desirable such services is certified e-mail delivery, in which the intended recipient will get the mail content if and only if the mail originator receives an irrefutable proof-of-delivery from the recipient. In this paper, we present the design of two third-party based certified mail protocols, termed CMP 1 and CMP 2. Both protocols are designed for integration into existing standard e-mail systems and both satisfy the requirements of non-repudiation of origin, non-repudiation of delivery, and fairness. The difference between CMP 1 and CMP 2 is that the former provides no mail content confidentiality protection while the la [...] ...|$|R

But faxing is still an essential part of doing business for certain types of documents (legal contracts, for example) and certain industries, such as public relations. Although there are some similar technologies developed for document faxing, there is main issue of security. By using this software we will fax the document through mobicloud using Android. There is not an issue of third party involved as like internet faxing, so security can achieved easily. For providing security we are using RSA algorithm for encryption and decryption.

40|$|During {{the last}} two decades the topic of human induced {{vibration}} has attracted a lot of attention among civil engineering practitioners and academics alike. Usually this type of problem may be encountered in pedestrian footbridges or floors of <b>paperless</b> <b>offices.</b> Slender designs are becoming increasingly popular, and as a consequence, the importance of paying attention to vibration serviceability also increases. This paper resumes the results obtained from measurements taken at different points of an aluminium catwalk which is 6 m in length by 0. 6 m in width. Measurements were carried out when subjecting the structure to different actions: 1) Static test: a steel cylinder of 35 kg was placed {{in the middle of the}} catwalk; 2) Dynamic test: this test consists of exciting the structure with singles impulses; 3) Dynamic test: people walking on the catwalk. Identification of the mechanical properties of the structure is an achievement of the paper. Indirect methods were used to estimate properties including the support stiffness, the beam bending stiffness, the mass of the structure (using Rayleigh method and iterative matrix method), the natural frequency (using the time domain and frequency domain analysis) and the damping ratio (by calculating the logarithmic decrement). Experimental results and numerical predictions for the response of an aluminium catwalk subjected to walking loads have been compared. The damping of this light weight structure depends on the amplitude of vibration which complicates the tuning of a structural model. In the light of the results obtained it seems that the used walking load model is not appropriate as the predicted transient vibration values (TTVs) are much higher than the measured ones...|$|R
40|$|The great {{dictionary}} of Indonesian language {{states that}} “office {{is a place}} or building to work and handling jobs”. Similarly, many scholars describe office {{as a place to}} manage administration. Globalization creates some opportunities to excel, at the same time comes up with serious challenges in terms of office management. On one hand, companies in developed nations are ready to adjust with main stream globalization issues such as green <b>office,</b> <b>paperless</b> system and international standardization to foster business across border accordingly. On the other hand, not all companies in the developing country are aware with those issues. Meanwhile, as a consequence of rapid competition in business, firstly employees’ working hour becomes longer than before, they spend more and more time doing duties at the office, including weekend. In Indonesian banking industries for instance, employees often have to stay late doing office works. In regard to the fact, their management responds with providing some extra equipments and tools to help employees feel at home. It includes preparing special program for relaxing. Secondly, although the usage of paper increases, many companies try to create their green office by office automation system. This paper aims to investigate the respond of Indonesian based companies toward transformation of office meaning and function. To what extend it has contribute to the globalization through shifting of office works and the usage of automation tools.

In 1996, he brought on board a friend and expert in Internet technology to help him realise his vision. In July 1997, his company was to move into its new office in Wan Chai. Their plan was to have in place an Intranet and a web-based document management system when they moved into the new office. But he had to be mindful of resulting changes in communication patterns, culture and expectations. Resistance from within his company was also threatening to ruin the grand plan. Several senior executives were fiercely opposed to the proposal and refused to read a document off a computer screen. But Ng knew it was an important initiative to move his practice forward. Once the decision was made there would be no chance to reconsider, given the workload demands of the new HK$ 12 billion project. And this decision would mark a watershed in the companyis evolution.

40|$|This MA thesis „E-Estonia 2000 - 2012 in the {{comparison}} of foreign media and experts“ {{provides an overview of}} e-Estonia’s representation in foreign media in comparison with the view of experts. Under my observation is the period 2000 - 2012 because in 2000 Estonia, being the first country in the world, launched a project of <b>paperless</b> government <b>office</b> called “e-government”. The aim of this master’s thesis is to analyse how foreign media have depicted Estonia’s efforts in the development of an e-state and which developments and projects have been under the media’s attention during the period. My focus is addressed towards {{the comparison}} of media coverage and experts who have been involved in making Estonia well-known for its e-government. In order to achieve my goal I conducted a media content analysis based on “The Washington Post”, “The New York Times”, “The Guardian” and “The Economist”. I also carried out 9 expert- informant interviews with experts who have been engaged in the history of e-Estonia beginning with Estonia’s president Toomas Hendrik Ilves. Expert interviews were analysed using qualitative data research. Foreign media and experts share different opinions about e-Estonia. While most media coverage is drawn on bringing out certain projects concerning Estonia’s e-government, experts put their attention on systematical change in Estonia’s society as a whole which made possible for Estonia to become an e-state. The qualitative data research brings out schemes, similarities, reasons and features of e-Estonia’s history and current situation. Findings also involved insufficiency in communication related to e-Estonia. The image about e-Estonia has evolved spontaneously without any central coordination from Estonia’s institutions. Estonia is known as the spokesman of cyber defence issues, but based on the media coverage, Estonia has lost her popularity {{as one of the most}} developed e-countries in the world. This opens up questions about the necessity of maintaining the image of an e-state. Experts share the opinion that such an image is essential for generating positive attention to a small country like Estonia. This attention can provide us with beneficial relations, security and advantages in economical growth. As most of the interviewed experts share the opinion that e-government is a characteristic success story related to Estonia, some find that this success story has never existed or is on the verge of a collapse. This brings out the idea that based on a person’s belonging to a certain community, experts see the success story differently. While media might not distinguish Estonia’s success story as an IT-tiger, the success story actually has developed and still continues to exist in different communities such as start-up communities or political-communities. In order to continue developing e-government and solutions characteristic to an e-state, Estonia must define its targets for the coming years. The success story of e-Estonia will depend on the cooperation of different institutions, spokespersons and a central coordination of communication which must also include national and international communication of e-Estonia...|$|R
