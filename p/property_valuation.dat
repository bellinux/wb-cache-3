Businesses {{found in the}} Industrial Park provide jobs in light manufacturing and assembly of electronic and automotive parts, among other things.

25|$|The {{property}} may be reassessed {{under certain}} conditions other than a change of ownership, such as when additions or new construction occur. The assessed value is also subject to reduction if {{the market value of}} the property declines below its assessed value, for example, during a real estate slump. Reductions of <b>property</b> <b>valuation</b> were not provided for by Proposition 13 itself, but were made possible by the passage of Proposition 8 (SCA No. 67) during 1978 that amended Proposition 13. Such a real estate slump and downward reassessments occurred during 2009 when the California State Board of Equalization announced an estimated reduction of property tax base year values due to negative inflation. The property tax in California is an Ad valorem tax meaning that the tax assessed (generally) increases and decreases with the value of the property.|$|E

500|$|In Eng Foong Ho, the Court of Appeal {{noted that}} it was not {{necessary}} to discuss the principle of reasonable classification of laws which was the subject of Taw Cheng Kong, since the appellants had not challenged the constitutionality of the Land Acquisition Act. In the present case, the appellants were challenging the application rather than the validity of the Act. The Court therefore applied a modified form of the Taw Cheng Kong rational nexus test, holding that [...] "he question is whether there is a reasonable nexus between the state action and the objective to be achieved by the law". The Court opinion relied on the principles set out in the Privy Council cases Howe Yoon Chong v. Chief Assessor (1980) and Howe Yoon Chong v. Chief Assessor (1990). These cases involved alleged inequality in <b>property</b> <b>valuation</b> for the purpose of determining property tax. The significance of the two Howe Yoon Chong cases is that they prescribed limits as to what constitutes inequality. Several salient points were drawn from the cases in Eng Foong Ho: ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a first order approximation of {{the accuracy of}} commercial <b>property</b> <b>valuations</b> for comparison with the ± 5 - 10 % threshold of tradition, convention and judicial acceptance. The nature of ranges is considered {{in relation to the}} uniform and normal probability density functions and the effects of bias considered. Summary statistics are examined for gross differences (differences between <b>property</b> <b>valuations</b> and subsequently realised transaction prices) recorded in the Investment Property Databank (IPD) database and significant yearly changes noted in both the means and standard deviations. A meta analysis of previous work is presented which shows all other results involving gross differences (GDs) to be reasonably consistent with statistics yielded by the IPD database. The results for the two main studies of net differences (GDs adjusted for the lag in time between valuation and transaction dates) also suggest yearly trends of a similar nature to the GDs. The role of intravaluer variability is also examined. The variability associated with the time lag is then estimated and applied to the IPD figures to give the approximation sought, suggesting ± 5 - 30 % to be a realisti...|$|R
