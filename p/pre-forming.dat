40|$|<b>Pre-forming</b> depth Abstract. Hydrodynamic {{deep drawing}} (HDD) is an {{effective}} method for manufacturing complicated and thin-walled parts. Aiming at the forming process of the stainless steel part with 0. 4 mm thick and complex stepped geometries, the technology scheme of multi-stage HDD assisted by conventional deep drawing (CDD) is proposed in consideration of wrinkling and destabilization in the unsupported region of the conical wall, and finite element models are built.

The method consists in <b>pre-forming</b> the sheets under two different strain conditions: uniaxial and biaxial, and then stretching the samples, {{cut out of the}} preformed sheets, using a Nakajima testing setup. The optical deformation measurement system used for the process analysis (ARAMIS, Company GOM) allows to record and to analyze the strain distribution very precisely with respect to both time and space.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{application}} of a strong-coupling expansion (perturbation theory in the hopping) for studying light-Fermi-heavy-Bose (like $^{ 40 }$K-$^{ 87 }$Rb) mixtures in optical lattices. We use the strong-coupling method to evaluate the efficiency for <b>pre-forming</b> molecules, the entropy per particle and the thermal fluctuations. We show that within the strong interaction regime (and at high temperature), the strong-coupling expansion is an economical way to study this problem. In some cases, it remains valid even down to low temperatures. Because the computational effort is minimal, the strong-coupling approach allows us to work with much larger system sizes, where boundary effects can be eliminated, which is particularly important at higher temperatures. Since the strong-coupling approach is so efficient and accurate, it allows one to rapidly scan through parameter space in order to optimize the <b>pre-forming</b> of molecules on a lattice (by choosing the lattice depth and interspecies attraction). Based on the strong-coupling calculations, we test the thermometry scheme based on the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and find the scheme gives accurate temperature estimation even at very low temperature.

40|$|Electromagnetic (EM) forming is a {{high-speed}} forming process {{that uses the}} forces induced on a conductive workpiece by a transient high frequency magnetic field to form the workpiece into a desired shape. It has been reported by several researchers that EM forming (EMF) increases the formability of hard-to-form aluminum alloy sheet under certain circumstances. EMF can be combined with conventional forming (e. g. stamping) operations to create a hybrid forming operation that exploits the strengths of each process. One such operation is the “corner fill” operation, which consists in <b>pre-forming</b> sheet using conventional forming and then using EMF to reduce the radii of different features on the part to values {{that could not be}} obtained with conventional forming.

40|$|Electromagnetic (EM) forming is a {{high-speed}} forming process {{that uses the}} forces induced on a conductive workpiece by a transient high frequency current to form the workpiece into a desired shape. This thesis {{presents the results of}} an experimental and numerical study carried out to determine whether an EM forming process could be used to sharpen the radius of part pre-formed using a stamping process. Two processes were studied; a single step EM forming operation and a “hybrid forming” operation consisting of a conventional <b>pre-forming</b> step and an EM corner fill, both considering aluminum alloy AA 5754. The single step EM process proved unable to form acceptable samples due to excessive sample distortion, but was used to gain insight into the EM forming process. The hybrid operation consisted of <b>pre-forming</b> 1 mm AA 5754 sheet into a v-shape with a 20 mm outer radius using a conventional stamping operation and then reducing or “sharpening” the radius to 5 mm using EM forming. Sharpening the radius to 5 mm using conventional stamping was not achievable. The hybrid operation proved successful in forming the 5 mm radius, thus demonstrating that the material could be formed beyond its conventional formability limit using the hybrid operation. Numerical models were used to gain insight into the processes and the challenges involved in their numerical simulation. The numerical simulations showed that EM corner fill operation produces very high strain rates (10, 000 - 100, 000 s- 1) and complex three dimensional stress and strain states. The effect of the high strain rates could not be properly assessed, since no constitutive data was available for such high strain rates. The predicted stress states show that the process was not plane stress and that large through-thickness compressive stresses are produced that are favorable to damage suppression and through-thickness shear strains that increase ductility. The high strain rates and the complex stress and strain states are considered the likely causes for the observed increase in formability. The models provided valuable insight, but did not predict the final shape exactly and the possible reasons behind this are analyzed. The research indicates that features that are not achievable using traditional stamping techniques can be obtained with the hybrid EM forming process...|$|E

Concentrations of growth media, molar ratio of Zn(NO 3) 2 to NaOH, and the supersaturation degree {{are the main}} factors in density- and length-controlled growth of ZnO nanorods. The water contact angle measurements showed that the density and dimension of nanorods would influence the surface wettability evidently. When applied a voltage in the 0 - 60 V range on the droplet, the nanorod arrays performed excellent gradual electrowetting responses. The ZnO nanorod array with highest density and dimension revealed the best electrowetting property with the contact angle change of 95 °.

40|$|Stochastic {{behaviors}} of resistive {{random access memory}} (RRAM) {{play an important role in}} the design of cross-point memory arrays. A Monte Carlo compact model of oxide RRAM is developed and calibrated with experiments on various device stack configurations. With Monte Carlo SPICE simulations, we show that an increase in array size and interconnect wire resistance will statistically deteriorate write functionality. Write failure probability (WFP) has an exponential dependency on device uniformity and supply voltage (VDD), and the array bias scheme is a key knob. Lowering array VDD leads to higher effective energy consumption (EEC) due to the increase in WFP when the variation statistics are included in the analysis. Random-access simulations indicate that data sparsity statistically benefits write functionality and energy consumption. Finally, we show that a pseudo-sub-array topology with uniformly distributed <b>pre-forming</b> cells in the pristine high resistance state is able to reduce both WFP and EEC, enabling higher net capacity for memory circuits due to improved variation tolerance.

Here, we use the droplet-interface bilayer as a platform to characterize distinct mechanistic differences between two such carriers: Pep- 1 and a guanidinium-rich peptide mimic we call D 9. While both Pep- 1 and D 9 can carry an enzyme, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) across a lipid bilayer, we found that they do so by different mechanisms. Specifically, Pep- 1 requires voltage or membrane asymmetry while D 9 does not. In addition, D 9 can facilitate HRP transport without <b>pre-forming</b> a complex with HRP. By contrast, complex formation is required by Pep- 1. Both carriers are capable of forming pores in membranes but our data hints that these pores are not responsible for cargo transport. Overall, D 9 appears to be a more potent and versatile transporter when compared with Pep- 1 because D 9 does not require an applied voltage or other forces to drive transport. Thus, D 9 might be used to deliver cargo across membranes under conditions where Pep- 1 would be ineffective...|$|E

Normally, inspection of a chip package is performed in a lead inspection machine after the lead forming process to detect defects on the leads.

It is {{an efficient way to}} form sheet metals into complex parts for automotive and aerospace industries. In comparison with conventional superplastic forming process, the forming time for superplastic-like forming can be significantly shortened as the hot-drawing step would have produced a pre-formed component before gas forming. The other advantage of the superplastic-like forming is its capacity for lower temperature forming, for which superplasticity is not possible. Non-superplastic grade Ti- 6 Al- 4 V sheets were successfully formed by superplastic-like forming at 800 °C in 16 min. The maximum percentage thinning of 54 % occurred at the outward corners. In this paper, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) was used to examine the microstructure evolution of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V at different forming stages during superplastic-like forming process. Some small equiaxed grains, regarded as newly recrystallized grains, were observed near the deformed area after hot drawing. Grains became more randomly distributed as the recrystallization continued during gas forming stage.

40|$|Abstract. During the <b>pre-forming</b> {{stage of}} the RTM process, large {{deformations}} can occur, especially for double-curved shapes. Knowing the mechanical behaviour and the actual geometry of fibrous reinforcements at the mesoscopic scale is of great importance for several applications like permeability evaluations. As such, forming modeling is particularly demanding {{on the quality of}} geometric modeling and on the mesh associated. Indeed, analysis of the internal structure of materials in general, and woven materials especially, recently led to major advances. X-ray Micro Tomography (XRMT or µCT) allows detailed and accurate 3 D observations inside the sample, which is not possible with the standard microscopy techniques restrained to surface observations. It distinguishes the yarns and even the fibers that define the directions of anisotropy of the material. A FE model is generated from the processed tomography images. It has been chosen in this study to use hypoelasticity behaviour law. Indeed, the yarns are submitted to large deformations, so that the orientation of the material is significantly modified and the fiber direction has to be strictly followed in order to fulfil the principle of objectivity. A way to retrieve the neutral composite reinforcement axis by skeletonization is proposed in order to know the privileged direction of the yarn and thus implement it in the constitutive law.
