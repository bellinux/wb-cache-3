40|$|Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are polyoxoesters {{that are}} {{produced}} by many bacteria and that accumulate as intracellular granules. Phasins (<b>PhaP)</b> are proteins that accumulate during PHA synthesis, bind PHA granules, and promote further PHA synthesis. Interestingly, <b>PhaP</b> accumulation seems to be strictly dependent on PHA synthesis, which is catalyzed by the PhaC PHA synthase. Here we have tested {{the effect of the}} Ralstonia eutropha PhaR protein on the regulation of <b>PhaP</b> accumulation. R. eutropha strains with phaR, phaC, and/or <b>phaP</b> deletions were constructed, and <b>PhaP</b> accumulation was measured by immunoblotting.

This result implies that PhaR is a negative regulator of <b>PhaP</b> accumulation and that PhaR specifically prevents <b>PhaP</b> from accumulating in cells that are not producing PHA. Transfer of the R. eutropha phaR, <b>phaP,</b> and PHA biosynthesis (phaCAB) genes into a heterologous system, Escherichia coli, was sufficient to reconstitute the PhaR/PhaP regulatory system, implying that PhaR both regulates <b>PhaP</b> accumulation and responds to PHA directly.

40|$|Phasins are {{proteins}} that are proposed to play {{important roles in}} polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis and granule formation. Here the phasin <b>PhaP</b> of Ralstonia eutropha has been analyzed with regard to {{its role in the}} synthesis of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). Purified recombinant <b>PhaP,</b> antibodies against <b>PhaP,</b> and an R. eutropha <b>phaP</b> deletion strain have been generated for this analysis. Studies with the <b>phaP</b> deletion strain show that <b>PhaP</b> must accumulate to high levels in order to play its normal role in PHB synthesis and that the accumulation of <b>PhaP</b> to low levels is functionally equivalent to the absence of <b>PhaP.</b> <b>PhaP</b> positively affects PHB synthesis under growth conditions which promote production of PHB to low, intermediate, or high levels. The levels of <b>PhaP</b> generally parallel levels of PHB in cells. The results are consistent with models whereby <b>PhaP</b> promotes PHB synthesis by regulating the surface/volume ratio of PHB granules or by interacting with polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase and indicate that <b>PhaP</b> {{plays an important role in}} PHB synthesis from the early stages in PHB production and across a range of growth conditions.

The genome sequencing of the endophytic and diazotrophic bacterium Herbaspirillum seropedicae SmR 1 revealed two homologous phasin genes.

Despite of the high sequence similarity between <b>PhaP</b> 1 and <b>PhaP</b> 2, <b>PhaP</b> 1 is the major phasin in H. seropedicae, since its deletion reduced PHB accumulation by ≈ 50 % in comparison to the parental and ΔphaP 2.

In this study, we identified three additional potential phasin genes (H 16 _B 1988, H 16 _B 2296, and H 16 _B 2326) by inspection of the R. eutropha genome for sequences with “phasin 2 motifs. ” To determine whether the corresponding proteins represent true PGAPs, fusions with eYFP (enhanced yellow fluorescent protein) were constructed. Similar fusions of eYFP with <b>PhaP</b> 1 to <b>PhaP</b> 5 as well as fusions with PHB synthase (PhaC 1), an inactive PhaC 1 variant (PhaC 1 -C 319 A), and PhaC 2 were also made. All fusions were investigated in wild-type and PHB-negative backgrounds. Colocalization with PHB granules was found for all PhaC variants and for <b>PhaP</b> 1 to <b>PhaP</b> 5. Addi-tionally, eYFP fusions with H 16 _B 1988 and H 16 _B 2326 colocalized with PHB. Fusions of H 16 _B 2296 with eYFP, however, did not colocalize with PHB granules but did colocalize with the nucleoid region. Notably, all fusions (except H 16 _B 2296) were solu-ble in aphaC 1 strain. These data confirm that H 16 _B 1988 and H 16 _B 2326 but not H 16 _B 2296 encode true PGAPs, for which we propose the designation <b>PhaP</b> 6 (H 16 _B 1988) and <b>PhaP</b> 7 (H 16 _B 2326).

While our results were consistent with these findings with respect to PhbA, PhbB, and PhbC, we observed significant up-regulation of the Phasin P 1 protein, and down-regulation of the Phasin P 4 protein in REG-GB and REG-FFA cultures. Phasins are small proteins associated with inclusion bodies in bacterial cells. Most are granule-associated proteins involved in accumulation of polyhydroxyalkanoate polymers, like PHB. Of the seven Phasin proteins (<b>PhaP</b> 1 -PhaP 7) encoded in the C. necator genome, only two, <b>PhaP</b> 1 and <b>PhaP</b> 4 (H 16 _A 1381 and H 16 _B 2021), were detected in our C. necator H 16 proteomes. <b>PhaP</b> 1 was up-regulated in REG-GB and REG-FFA in comparison to REG- 80 cultures.
