Trivially the size is an upper bound to the number or <b>proor</b> lines. It {{is much more difficult}} to bound the size using the number or <b>proor</b> lines. ff we consider logic without runction symbols a reasonable bound can be proved (see Proposition 3. 4). ff runction symbols are allowed, then the situation is considerably more complicated. In such a case rormulas in the <b>proor</b> may contain large terms {{and it is difficult to}} find some bounds to the size or these terms using only the information about the number or <b>proor</b> lines. There are still important open problems bere which show that the role or terms in the first order logic is not quite well understood.

40|$|Angiogenesis, {{the process}} of new blood vessels formation, {{plays a key role}} in {{different}} physiological and pathological conditions and it is considered a promising target for the development of new anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor therapies. Several assays have been developed to mimic the angiogenic process in vitro and in vivo. Here we propose a technique for the quantification of the pro-angiogenic or anti-angiogenic responses induced by different molecules when implanted in vivo on the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). At day 11 of development CAM is completely vascularized and neo-vessels induced by exogenous molecules converge radially to the implant. Our algorithm is an effective and rapid tool to characterize molecules endowed with <b>proor</b> anti-angiogenic effects by means of the quantification of the vessels present in the CAM macroscopic images. Based on conventional and dedicated image morphology tools, the proposed technique is able to discriminate radial from non-radial vessels, excluding the last ones from the count...|$|E

40|$|Notch transmembrane receptors {{family in}} humans {{consists}} of 4 proteins (Notch 1 – 4) which are activated upon direct contact of cells, carrying appropriate ligands of Jagged or Dll families. This interaction leads to certain proteolytic events resulting in Notch intracellular domain translocation to the nucleus, where it activates various signaling pathways regulating {{the balance between}} cellular proliferation, apoptosis or differentiation. Proteins of the Notch family influence intraand intercellular pathways and communications {{of the majority of}} cell types. These receptors regulate both embryogenesis and adult organs and tissues homeostasis sustenance. Dysregulation of Notch signaling result in various diseases, and carcinogenesis as well. These Notch alterations are better studied in various hemoblastoses but it,s involvement in solid tumors car- cinogenesis has recently been shown. Notch <b>proor</b> antioncogenic action depends not only on the type of transformed cells but also on their microenvironment. This review is dedicated to canonical Notch signaling, as well as to non-canonical actions, epigenetic regulation and current proand antioncogenic functions in human malignancies. Special attention is drawn to interaction between Notch and other signaling pathways controlling epithelia-to-mesenchyma transition of cells, stem cells formation, sustention of specific niches, cellular differentiation, angiogenesis both during embryogenesis and in pathological conditions. Pharmacological regulation of Notch activation could be a promising way of anticancer therapy...|$|E
40|$|Religion {{has always}} {{played a role}} in nation formation, and {{continues}} to do so even in these late-modern and past-sacred times. The overall argument of the essay is that the nation formation involves both deep continuities and radical discontinuities with the sacredly conceived ways of life. It is not wrong to say that religious evocation is bound up in the will to power, {{but it is important to}} recognize that there are much larger social reasons why religion is linked to the name of the nation. This essay thus resonated with Ivan Strenski&# 039;s article in this volume when he argues that proce 4 sses of legitimating go deep into the past. However, it adds another claim: namely, that religious evocation works as an act of legitimation because of the very nature of the community (the nation) in whose name the evocation is made. Read through the flickering screen of the globalising and post-modernising nation state with all its contradictions, it is hard to see any continuities-of-form here. The continuities at most appear as surface content, and even then only as points of reference, a Jewish Bible, a Christian cross, a slab of engraved marble. However, the postmodern/late-modern nation has all the ontological vulnerabilities of the <b>proor</b> dominant forms of polity. Despite unprecedented technical power, it still has to legitimize itself, at one level, through basic categories of human existence such as embodiment, placement and temporal transcendence...|$|E
40|$|Angiogenesis is {{the growth}} of new blood vessels from {{existing}} vasculature; it requires the breakdown of existing blood vessel walls followed by the migration and proliferation of endothelial cells to form the new vessels. It is a complex process that is regulated by many pro- and anti-angiogenic factors and the roles {{of some of these}} factors are still unclear. Angiogenesis is a key feature of many pathological conditions including cancer, polycystic ovary syndrome and endometriosis so is an area of great research interest. There are several methods currently available for the study of angiogenesis, both in vitro and in vivo, and whilst all of these methods have enhanced understanding of angiogenesis, they also have limitations. The ovary is an excellent model for the study of angiogenesis as it undergoes intense vascular morphogenesis in a cyclical manner. The female reproductive system is unique as no other healthy adult tissue undergoes spontaneous angiogenesis. The tissues in the ovary undergo constant remodelling during both folliculogenesis and the formation and regression of the corpus luteum. Blood vessels are recruited from the ovarian stroma at the preantral stage to form vascular sheaths, in the thecal layer, which surround the developing follicle and supply nutrients, hormones and allow gaseous exchange. As follicular development progresses to the antral stage, when gonadotrophin-dependence is established, increased angiogenesis is essential to sustain development of the rapidly expanding follicle. Previous research into ovarian angiogenesis has focussed on the corpus luteum but the mechanisms of the regulation of angiogenesis during folliculogenesis need further elucidation. The work in this thesis aims to develop and utilise an in vitro angiogenesis assay using the culture of intact preantral and early antral follicles to provide a new approach to the study of follicular angiogenesis. During the course of this thesis this assay was utilised to investigate the effect of various factors on follicular angiogenesis and ovarian function. The role of the putative anti-angiogenic factor thrombospondin- 1 (TSP- 1) in the regulation of physiological angiogenesis was investigated using the in vitro angiogenesis assay developed {{during the course of this}} thesis and the role of TSP- 1 in normal ovarian function was investigated using the culture of isolated granulosa cells. The results suggest that TSP- 1 is able to inhibit angiogenesis and that it has an extravascular role in the ovary, in vitro. These findings were extended to an in vivo angiogenesis model where follicular angiogenesis was assessed by quantitative immunohistochemistry for bromodeoxyuridine and the endothelial cell marker CD 31. The extravascular role for TSP- 1 was also further investigated in vivo and was assessed by quantitative immunohistochemistry for activated caspase- 3. The results confirmed the findings of the in vitro study, indicating that TSP- 1 has antiangiogenic action and acts to clear non-dominant follicles from the ovary through the induction of atresia. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the main factor involved in stimulating angiogenesis and many advances have been made into elucidating the role, and the mechanisms of action, of VEGF on angiogenesis. Angiopoietin- 1 (Ang- 1) is considered to be one of the main factors acting in concert with VEGF to stabilise new blood vessels and its role in angiogenesis has been the subject of much discussion and controversy. This thesis investigates the effects of Ang- 1 on follicular angiogenesis and development, using the in vitro angiogenesis assay, granulosa cell culture and RNA knockdown experiments. The results have shown that Ang- 1 can induce follicular angiogenesis at high doses and that at low doses stimulates prosurvival pathways and inhibits apoptotic mediators. This thesis describes a novel in vitro culture system for the study of angiogenesis in ovarian follicles. Using this system the effects of various factors on follicular angiogenesis and on follicle development and survival have been investigated. Investigations into the mechanisms of action of these factors have also been performed. These studies have improved understanding of the regulation of follicular angiogenesis and have indicated extravascular roles for angiogenic factors in the ovary. Since angiogenesis is a key feature of many pathological conditions, the ability to manipulate angiogenesis and to investigate and quantify the effects of <b>proor</b> anti-angiogenic compounds may have important clinical implications.
