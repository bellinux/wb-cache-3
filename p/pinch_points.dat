40|$|Supercritical {{carbon dioxide}} (S-CO 2) cycles are {{recently}} very perspective and are researched {{all around the}} world. Research of the S-CO 2 cycles is ongoing at the Czech Technical University (CTU) as well. Research on CTU {{is focused on the}} <b>pinch</b> <b>point</b> analysis. This point affects the entire loop and causes problems during the design of individual components. Therefore it is necessary to find the location of this point during the cycle design, for specific conditions (temperature, pressure). For known pressures and temperatures the <b>pinch</b> <b>point</b> can be found in several ways by using heat capacity profiles. If this point occurs in the heat exchanger, it causes complications in designs. Due to the <b>pinch</b> <b>point,</b> heat exchangers have a large size and a low efficiency. The <b>pinch</b> <b>point</b> can be removed with the addition of small amounts of another gas. The critical point of this other gas is at a different temperature and pressure. For the mixture of CO 2 and another gas the <b>pinch</b> <b>point</b> location will be altered, thereby allowing the removal of this point from the heat exchangers. However, adding other gases has affects the behavior of other components in the loop and the subsequent change in the cycle efficiency of the loop.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this note}} we {{construct}} strange attractors {{in a class}} of skew product dynamical systems. A dynamical system of the class is a bundle map of a trivial bundle whose base is a compact metric space and the fiber is the non-negative half real line. The map on the base is a homeomorphism preserving an ergodic measure. The fiber maps either are strictly monotone and strictly concave or collapse at zero (<b>pinching</b> condition). The <b>points</b> on the base space whose fibers collapse are the <b>pinched</b> <b>points</b> of the skew product. We also assume that the set of <b>pinched</b> <b>points</b> has zero measure, {{and that there is a}} <b>pinched</b> <b>point</b> whose orbit is dense in the base space. Moreover, we assume that the zero-section is a super-repeller, in the sense that it is invariant and its Lyapunov exponent is +∞. For such a skew product dynamical system, we prove the existence of a measurable but non-continuous invariant graph, whose Lyapunov exponent is negative. We will refer to such an object as a strange attractor. Since the dynamics on the strange attractor is the one given by the base homeomorphism, we will say that it is a strange chaotic attractor or a strange non-chaotic attractor depending on the fact that the dynamics on the base is chaotic or non-chaotic. 1...|$|R
