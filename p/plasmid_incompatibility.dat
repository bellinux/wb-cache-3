40|$|<b>Plasmid</b> <b>incompatibility</b> was {{studied in}} Escherichia coli K- 12. By double-antibiotic selection, clones were {{constructed}} {{that carried the}} two R-factors R 1 and R 100, both belonging to the compatibility group FII. After release of the selection pressure, {{each of the two}} plasmids was lost at the same rate (8 % per generation). Mutants of R-factor R 1 showing an increased number of copies per chromosome (copy mutants) were tested for their incompatibility towards R-factor R 100. The results indicate that <b>plasmid</b> <b>incompatibility</b> is quantitative and not just a qualitative property. All copy mutants studied affected incompatibility, and there were two classes of mutants: one increasing and one decreasing the incompatiblity exerted towards the test plasmid R 100. Evidence is presented that incompatibility is related to the mechanisms that control replication. The implications of such a relation on proposed models for control of replication are discussed. The data do not support the hypothesis that <b>plasmid</b> <b>incompatibility</b> is due to competition for a replicational or segregational site...|$|E

The 231 -kilobase Ti plasmid which {{has been shown to}} {{determine}} host range, was subcloned into the vector pVCK 102. By comparing overlaps of cloned insets, maps were constructed for the restriction endonucleases SalI, XhoI, EcoRI, and KpnI. <b>Plasmid</b> <b>incompatibility,</b> octopine catabolism, and at least six virulence genes were localized. <b>Plasmid</b> <b>incompatibility</b> between pTiAg 162 and the wide host range plasmid pTiA 6 consists of two components: mutual incompatibility and the apparent ability of pTiA 6 to block RK 2 replication if the pTiAg 162 incompatibility locus is linked to the vector pVK 102. The octopine catabolism locus maps within the 30 kilobases of DNA separating the two T-DNA regions of pTiAg 162. Complementation of avirulent vir mutants of pTiA 6 with clones of pTiAg 162 DNA did not confer the host range of pTiAg 162 but rather restored the wide host range of pTiA 6.

The aim of the present study was to further characterize 24 extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolated from domestic and imported poultry meat by antibiotic susceptibility testing, identification of the bla ESBL/bla pAmpC genes, conjugation mating experiments and determination of <b>plasmid</b> <b>incompatibility</b> types, multilocus sequence typing, and analysis of the Escherichia coli phylogenetic groups. On account of their resistance patterns, 21 of the total 24 isolates were classified as multidrug resistant. Eleven isolates carried a bla CMY- 2 gene, whereas 13 isolates harbored a bla CTX-M- 1 gene. All isolates harbored plasmids that were assigned to 8 of the 18 described <b>plasmid</b> <b>incompatibility</b> groups, the most frequent of which were IncI 1, IncFIB, IncB/O, and IncFrepB.

40|$|The P 1 plasmid {{partition}} {{system is}} responsible for segregation of daughter plasmids during division of the Escherichia coli host cell. The P 1 -encoded elements consist of two essential proteins, ParA and ParB, and the cis-acting incB region. The incB region determines partition-mediated incompatibility and contains the centromere-like site parS. We have isolated and purified the two proteins. ParB binds specifically to the incB region in vitro. DNase I footprinting assays place a strong binding site over the 35 -bp parS sequence previously shown to be sufficient for partition when the Par proteins are supplied in trans. A weaker site lies within the incB region in sequences that are important for specifying incompatibility, but are not essential for partition. Gel band retardation assays show that a host factor binds specifically to the incB sequence. The factor strongly stimulates binding of ParB. Cutting the region at a site between the two ParB binding sites yields two fragments that can bind ParB but not host factor. Thus, information for host-factor binding lies in the region determining the specificity of <b>plasmid</b> <b>incompatibility.</b> The roles of parB and the host factor in partition and the specificity of <b>plasmid</b> <b>incompatibility</b> are discussed...|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} the dynamics behind the worldwide {{spread of the}} mcr- 1 gene, we determined the population structure of Escherichia coli and of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) carrying the mcr- 1 gene. After a systematic {{review of the literature}} we included 65 E. coli whole genome sequences (WGS), adding 6 recently sequenced travel related isolates, and 312 MLST profiles. We included 219 MGEs described in 7 Enterobacteriaceae species isolated from human, animal and environmental samples. Despite a high overall diversity, 2 lineages were observed in the E. coli population that may function as reservoirs of the mcr- 1 gene, the largest of which was linked to ST 10, a sequence type known for its ubiquity in human faecal samples and in food samples. No genotypic clustering by geographical origin or isolation source was observed. Amongst a total of 13 <b>plasmid</b> <b>incompatibility</b> types, the IncI 2, IncX 4 and IncHI 2 plasmids accounted for more than 90 % of MGEs carrying the mcr- 1 gene. We observed significant geographical clustering with regional spread of IncHI 2 plasmids in Europe and IncI 2 in Asia. These findings point towards promiscuous spread of the mcr- 1 gene by efficient horizontal gene transfer dominated by a limited number of <b>plasmid</b> <b>incompatibility</b> type...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Bacteria {{routinely}} become {{resistant to}} antibiotics through the uptake of plasmids that encode resistance-mediating proteins. Such plasmid-based resistance is seen extensively in clinical settings {{and has been}} documented {{for a wide variety}} of bacterial infections from both Gram-positive and Gramnegative organisms. We recently reported that a small molecule could be used to mimic a natural process of plasmid elimination, called <b>plasmid</b> <b>incompatibility,</b> and that the addition of this compound causes elimination of an IncB plasmid from E. coli and a subsequent resensitization to antibiotics [DeNap, Thomas, Musk, and Hergenrother (2004) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 126, 15402 - 15404]. Described herein is a further substantiation and validation of the notion that <b>plasmid</b> <b>incompatibility</b> can be mimicked with small molecules that bind to important RNA targets controlling plasmid replication. In this study, the dissociation constant and stoichiometry of RNA binding are determined for 12 aminoglycosides with stem-loop I (SLI) of the IncB replication machinery. Importantly, it is found that compounds that do not bind to this RNA replication control element fail to induce plasmid loss in vivo, whereas those that do bind to the RNA typically cause measurable plasmid loss. These results highlight the potential for targeting key RNA regions for induction of plasmid loss and the subsequent resensitization of bacteria to antibiotics. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics poses a significant threa...|$|E

40|$|Antibiotic {{resistance}} {{increases the}} likelihood of death from infection by common pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae in developed and developing countries alike. Most important modern antibiotic resistance genes spread between such species on self-transmissible (conjugative) plasmids. These plasmids are traditionally grouped on the basis of replicon incompatibility (Inc), which prevents coexistence of related plasmids in the same cell. These plasmids also use post-segregational killing ('addiction') systems, which poison any bacterial cells that lose the addictive plasmid, to guarantee their own survival. This study demonstrates that <b>plasmid</b> <b>incompatibilities</b> and addiction systems can be exploited to achieve the safe and complete eradication of antibiotic resistance from bacteria in vitro and in the mouse gut. Conjugative 'interference plasmids' were constructed by specifically deleting toxin and antibiotic resistance genes from target plasmids. These interference plasmids efficiently cured the corresponding antibiotic resistant target plasmid from different Enterobacteriaceae in vitro and restored antibiotic susceptibility in vivo to all bacterial populations into which plasmid-mediated resistance had spread. This approach might allow eradication of emergent or established populations of resistance plasmids in individuals at risk of severe sepsis, enabling subsequent use of less toxic and/or more effective antibiotics than would otherwise be possible, if sepsis develops. The generalisability of this approach and its potential applications in bioremediation of animal and environmental microbiomes should now be systematically explored...|$|R

40|$|Examination of a {{group of}} mutants of plasmid NR 1 that had lost the {{expression}} of IncFII <b>plasmid</b> <b>incompatibility</b> (Inc-) revealed a group that had also lost replication proficiency (Rep-). These mutants were obtained from plasmids in which the NR 1 replication control region was present in a cointegrate with plasmid pBR 322. Whereas the wild-type parental cointegrate plasmid was capable of replicating in a poL 4 host owing to the PoIA independence ofNR 1 replication, the mutants were not able to transform apoL 4 host. Losses ofboth expression of IncFIH <b>plasmid</b> <b>incompatibility</b> and replication proficiency were found to result from the same single base-pair substitution in four independently isolated Inc- Rep- mutants. The mutation inactivates promoter PE for the transcription of RNA-E, a trans-acting repressor of translation of the essential RepAl replication initiation protein of NR 1. Although the loss of RNA-E synthesis had been expected to increase the expression ofrepAl, the efficiency of translation ofrepAl mRNA from these mutants was at least 100 -fold lower than that from the wild type, as revealed by repAl-lacZ translational fusions. The PE mutation introduced a stop codon into a 24 -amino-acid reading frame that precedes the repAl gene and terminates just 2 bp downstream from the repAl start codon.
