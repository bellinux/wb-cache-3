40|$|Background] : Bietti {{crystalline}} retinopathy (BCR) is {{a distinct}} retinal degenerative disease characterised by retinal degeneration with many yellow–white crystals located mainly at the posterior pole area. Using spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), the structural change in retina was investigated. [Methods] : Patients diagnosed with BCR (n= 12), retinitis pigmentosa (RP, n= 292) and cone dystrophy (n= 16) were included in this study. The authors mainly examined fundus photographs and SD-OCT, infrared and fundus autofluorescence images of these patients. [Results]: <b>Crystalline</b> <b>deposits</b> were detected in portions of the retinal pigment epithelium that lacked patchy degenerated lesions. SD-OCT revealed {{that most of the}} observed <b>crystalline</b> <b>deposits</b> were located adjacent to the inner side of retinal pigment epithelium layer. The change most frequently observed was circular hyper-refractive structures in the outer nuclear layer. Although the structures were considered to be previously reported “tubular formation” or “tubular degeneration”, we determined that many of these circular structures were slices of spherical structures and were typically noted in areas suspected of ongoing active degeneration. [Conclusion] : BCR has characteristic structures in the outer nuclear layer. Although the incidence of the structure varies, it may be characteristic of retinal degeneration and can be found in many retinal degenerative diseases...|$|R

Extensive investigations are often required to reveal the mechanisms underlying such toxicological events {{and in the case}} of <b>crystalline</b> <b>deposits</b> the chemical composition can be problematic to determine. In the present study, we have used mass spectrometry imaging combined with a set of advanced analytical techniques to characterize such <b>crystalline</b> <b>deposits</b> in situ.

Results from direct tissue section analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging were combined with data obtained following manual crystal dissection analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The chemical composition of the crystal deposits was successfully identified as a common metabolite, bisulphonamide, of the two drug candidates.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Necrotizing infundibular {{crystalline}} folliculitis (NICF) is a folliculocentric disorder {{associated with}} filamentous <b>crystalline</b> <b>deposits,</b> enclosed by parakeratotic columns within the partly necrotic follicular ostium and infundibulum. There are only very few data published about this disorder of unknown origin. OBJECTIVE: We {{sought to determine}} the clinicopathological features and pathogenetic aspects of NICF. METHODS: Clinicopathological characterization of 9 patients with NICF and a second group of 7 patients with coincidental findings of NICF {{in the vicinity of}} epithelial skin neoplasms was conducted. RESULTS: Clinically, NICF is characterized by multiple waxy papules with predilection for the forehead (56 %), neck, and back. Birefringent <b>crystalline</b> <b>deposits</b> were present in the follicular ostia and enclosed by parakeratotic columns in all cases. The necrosis of follicular epithelium was found in 89 % and perifollicular neutrophilic infiltrate in 22 % of the biopsy specimens. Both yeasts and gram-positive bacteria were identified within the affected follicles in 56 % in the first group and 86 % in the second group of coincidental NICF. LIMITATION: This was a single-center retrospective study. CONCLUSIONS: NICF is both a distinct entity and an epiphenomenon in the context of other disorders. In regard to the common association with yeasts and gram-positive bacteria in the affected follicles, we hypothesize that NICF is pathogenetically linked to these organisms, which is supported by resolution of the lesions after topical or systemic antimycotic treatment...|$|R
