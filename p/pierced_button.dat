500|$|Writing for Studies in Philosophy and Education, Doret de Ruyter {{approved}} of Levinson's emphasis on autonomy and concurred that Levinson's definition of autonomy would be agreeable to citizens of Western liberal countries. De Ruyter was unsure about edge cases of autonomy, {{such as whether}} being closed-minded to {{the prospect of a}} <b>pierced</b> belly <b>button</b> would make her a less autonomous person in Levinson's view. She also disagreed with Levinson's position of parental [...] "privilege" [...] (rather than right) over their children, and invoked Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld to argue that parents instead have the opposite of a privilege, a [...] "duty", to their children's interests and require the liberty to fulfill it, including through education. To defend this parental duty to children and freedom from society in fulfillment of the duty, de Ruyter cited John Eekelaar's parental duty-right to educate children: a positive right to educate as they see fit and a negative right that prevents others from impeding. She concluded that the state's duty conflicts with the duty of parents and thus the state's duty is [...] "primarily ... against children".|$|R
50|$|A navel {{piercing}} (also {{referred to}} as a belly <b>button</b> <b>piercing</b> or an umbilical dip piercing) is a type of piercing located in, or around, the navel. It may heal quickly and with no problems, like an ear piercing, or may heal more like a surface piercing with the associated extended healing time. Healing usually takes less than six months, and {{as long as it is}} cleaned, it will heal nicely. Unlike most surface piercings, this is one of the few that do not normally reject, although the rejection rate is higher than non-surface piercings, such as ear piercing. The actual navel is not pierced when a navel piercing is performed. The most common form of navel piercing is through the upper rim of the navel.|$|R
