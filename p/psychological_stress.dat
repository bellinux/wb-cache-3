5|$|Psoriasis is {{generally}} {{thought to be}} a genetic disease that is triggered by environmental factors. In twin studies, identical twins are {{three times more likely to}} be affected compared to non-identical twins. This suggests that genetic factors predispose to psoriasis. Symptoms often worsen during winter and with certain medications, such as beta blockers or NSAIDs. Infections and <b>psychological</b> <b>stress</b> can also play a role. Psoriasis is not contagious. The underlying mechanism involves the immune system reacting to skin cells. Diagnosis is typically based on the signs and symptoms.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} anecdotal reports of dogs, horses and {{dolphins}} killing themselves. There, however, {{has been little}} scientific study of animal suicide. Animal suicide is usually put down to romantic human interpretation and is not generally thought to be intentional. Some of the reasons animals are thought to unintentionally kill themselves include: <b>psychological</b> <b>stress,</b> infection by certain parasites or fungi, or disruption of a long held social tie, such as the ending of a long association with an owner and thus not accepting food from another individual.|$|E

5|$|For {{purposes}} of geophysical and oceanographic research {{and to determine}} habitability, endurance and <b>psychological</b> <b>stress</b> – all extremely important to the Polaris program – it had been decided that a rapid round-the-world trip, touching the areas of interest, should be conducted. Maximum stability of the observing platform and unbroken continuity around the world were important. Additionally, for reasons of the national interest it had been decided that the voyage should be made entirely submerged undetected by our own or other forces and completed as soon as possible. TRITON, because of her size, speed and extra dependability of her two-reactor plant, had been chosen for the mission.|$|E
5|$|Well over 200 virus strains are {{implicated in}} the cause of the common cold; the rhinoviruses are the most common. They spread through the air during close contact with {{infected}} people and indirectly through contact with objects in the environment followed by transfer to the mouth or nose. Risk factors include going to daycare, not sleeping well, and <b>psychological</b> <b>stress.</b> Symptoms are mostly due to the body's immune response to the infection rather than to tissue destruction by the viruses themselves. People with influenza often show similar symptoms as people with a cold, though symptoms are usually more severe in the former. Influenza is less likely to result in a runny nose.|$|E

25|$|The {{cause of}} Rosacea is unknown. Risk factors are {{believed}} to include {{a family history of}} the condition. Factors that may potentially worsen the condition include heat, exercise, sunlight, cold, spicy food, alcohol, menopause, <b>psychological</b> <b>stress,</b> or steroid cream on the face. Diagnosis is based on symptoms.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} panic {{disorder}} is unknown. Panic disorder often runs in families. Risk factors include smoking, <b>psychological</b> <b>stress,</b> {{and a history}} of child abuse. Diagnosis involves ruling out other potential causes of anxiety including other mental disorders, medical conditions such as heart disease or hyperthyroidism, and drug use. Screening for the condition may be done using a questionnaire.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{advances}} in {{bone marrow transplant}} technology, major <b>psychological</b> <b>stresses</b> remain. Donor selection has become psychologically more complex with the option of seeking an unrelated donor. Family dislocation continues to be necessary for many families despite the proliferation of transplant centers. The range of choices between treatment options, level of room sterility, and the like can leave families open to guilt about their choices. Unpredictability of the transplant course, difficulty for patients in assessing the seriousness of symptoms, {{and the need to}} rely on a changing roster of teaching hospital physicians contribute to patient anxiety. Contrary to patient expectations, post-discharge recovery is often longer and more complicated, physically and psychologically, than expected. Follow-up studies on BMT patients show that a majority have a return to a satisfactory level of activity, although some physical symptoms may remain. Behavioral symptoms did increase, with estimates ranging from 15 - 35 percent of the survivors showing symptoms a year or more post-transplant. Staff impact is briefly addressed. The need for more research on psychosocial follow-up is stressed. Despite {{advances in}} bone marrow transplant (BMT) technology over the past 15 years [1, 2], the <b>psychological</b> <b>stresses</b> of transplant remain. In some cases, the stres...|$|R

25|$|The {{condition}} {{may occur}} {{in those who}} are otherwise healthy, those with narcolepsy, or may run in families {{as a result of}} specific genetic changes. The condition can be triggered by sleep deprivation, <b>psychological</b> <b>stress,</b> or abnormal sleep cycles. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve a dysfunction in REM sleep. Diagnosis is based on a person's description. Other conditions that can present similarly include narcolepsy, atonic seizure, and hypokalemic periodic paralysis.|$|E
25|$|Burgess {{believes}} that modern <b>psychological</b> <b>stress</b> and crowding impair our mental processes and worsen {{mental illness and}} physical disease. He advocates the use of relaxation techniques, meditation, and contemplation of art to reduce the stress response and clear the mind, and he has published a collection of these exercises. He associates the state of clarity achieved with meditative techniques with spiritual enlightenment and his books on Taoism and Zen explain these beliefs.|$|E
500|$|The {{causes of}} Mertz's death and Mawson's related illness remain uncertain; a 1969 study {{suggested}} hypervitaminosis A, presumably {{caused by the}} men eating the livers of their Greenland Huskies, which are now known to be unusually high in vitamin A.

25|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{discovered}} a pathway that links stress to the onset of disease through the activation of certain genes. The experience of <b>psychological</b> <b>stress</b> activates transcription factors that activate genes. In a study by Cole et al., {{it was concluded that}} GABA-1 transcription factor activates the interleukin-6-gene. This gene codes for a protein that activates the inflammatory response which directs an immune response {{to the site of the}} inflammation. Chronic inflammation makes an individual more susceptible to diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes.|$|E
25|$|Vitiligo is a {{long term}} skin {{condition}} characterized by patches of the skin losing their pigment. The patches of skin affected become white and usually have sharp margins. The hair from the skin may also become white. Inside the mouth and nose may also be involved. Typically {{both sides of the}} body are affected. Often the patches begin on areas of skin that are exposed to the sun. It is more noticeable in people with dark skin.

25|$|The {{atypical}} clinical syndrome of {{the memory}} disorder (as opposed to organic amnesia) is that a person with psychogenic amnesia is profoundly unable to remember personal information about themselves; {{there is a lack}} of conscious self-knowledge which affects even simple self-knowledge, such as who they are. Psychogenic amnesia is distinguished from organic amnesia in that it is supposed to result from a nonorganic cause; no structural brain damage or brain lesion should be evident but some form of <b>psychological</b> <b>stress</b> should precipitate the amnesia, however psychogenic amnesia as a memory disorder is controversial.|$|E
