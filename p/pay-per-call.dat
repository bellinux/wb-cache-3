50|$|<b>Pay-per-call</b> (PPCall, {{also called}} cost-per-call) is an {{advertising}} {{model in which}} the rate paid by the advertiser {{is determined by the}} number of telephone calls made by viewers of an ad. Pay Per Call providers charge per call, per impression or per conversion. It is similar to online pay per click (PPC) advertising, but induces the viewer to make a telephone call instead of viewing an external website. Both enterprises looking to reach certain locations, or local/regional businesses can benefit from Pay Per Call campaigns, because it allows customers to talk with the seller before buying a product or service. Vendors of <b>pay-per-call</b> advertising attribute the growth of the model to the popularity of smartphones and claim that it reduces the costs of on-line click fraud. <b>Pay-per-call</b> advertising is {{not to be confused with}} premium-rate telephone numbers. <b>Pay-per-call</b> is the inverse of a premium telephone number, in that the advertiser who receives the call, not the caller, is charged for the service. Since it is cost per lead advertising, the rates are higher than for toll-free telephone number service. In general, the advertiser is only billed for calls that last at least one minute.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pay-per-call</b> {{applications}} dated back to {{as early}} as 1971. Typically a caller would dial an advertised phone number with a 900 or 976 prefix. The caller would be billed a fixed amount per minute by the phone company. The phone company kept {{a portion of the}} revenue with the balance going to the sponsor of the call. There were many <b>pay-per-call</b> services: sports scores, weather forecasts, even dating lines. A new twist was added to this mix {{in the latter part of}} the 1980s. It was known as Audiotext, a relatively simple concept that combined a <b>pay-per-call</b> application with sophisticated answering machine technology ("IVR"). A person would call a 900 number and enter the voice mailbox number of the service or person for whom they wished to leave a message. Much like a voice-mail system in typical office environments, the person who owned the mailbox could listen to the recorded message at a later time and respond appropriately.|$|E

Over 50 surfers were employed to relay dawn surf conditions from their local surf breaks to a central office in Huntington Beach, California, where a special phone system made the reports available to callers for 50 cents each. The telephone number, 976-SURF, became {{well known in the}} surfing world. The company received 6,000 calls per day in its first month and grew from there. Surfline's offerings expanded throughout Southern California to Northern California and then into Florida and Texas.|$|E
50|$|The {{basic form}} of CTC (Request-a-Call) {{technology}} currently in general use is {{just exactly what}} Request-a-Call sounds like: an end user enters her phone number through a web dialog box, then an intermediary service calls both that end user and the merchant or other respective third party, and connects the two together for an ordinary telephone conversation. It is instructive {{to think of this}} implementation as the familiar three-party call, or conference call. The user wants to talk to a website representative, so the CTC provider calls the user and the representative and then bridges the call between them in one way or another. As to cost, typically the website operator or its client pays for CTC services. It is comparatively rare for a consumer to be charged for CTC services in typical web commerce, except of course in designedly <b>pay-per-call</b> implementations, as may be found on adult websites or other sites with business models involving payment for media presentation. Regardless of who pays, three way calls are more expensive than 2 way calls, so the most cost effective CTC providers drop off after the desired connection is made, preventing pass through of any 3-way call charges.|$|E

We consider a variety of contracts, all based on our observations of contracts used by one large vendor.

We show how different combinations of these contract features enable client firms to better manage vendors when there is information asymmetry about worker productivity. In particular, we focus on how different contracts can coordinate by yielding the system-optimal capacity decision by the vendor and consider how profits are allocated between the client and the vendor. call center, outsourcing, contracts, service supply chains, staffing...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. An {{important}} current {{trend in}} online advertising is {{the shift from}} traditional, “pay-per-exposure” mechanisms to, allegedly more efficient, “pay-per-action ” methods, such as pay-per-click, <b>pay-per-call</b> and, in some cases, even pay-per-sale. While {{there is a growing}} stream of research examining sponsored search and other types of online advertising, an important area that has not yet received sufficient attention is the interplay between payment mechanisms and the strategies of firms who choose to invest in such types of advertising. Our objective in this work is to examine how the shift from pay-per-exposure to various pay-per-action mechanisms affects prices and demand, the allocation of advertising slots to different firm types (high vs. low quality), and the payoffs to the publisher and the advertisers. Contrary to conventional wisdom we find that, under certain conditions, the move to pay-per-action can lead to an increase in prices, a decrease in the average quality of firms advertising in these markets, and a decrease in payoffs for all stakeholders. We further observe that, most current and proposed forms of pay-per-action advertising constitute a conceptually flawed {{solution to the problem of}} risk-sharing between advertisers and the publisher in settings where there is two-sided uncertainty. We explore alternative mechanisms with better properties. 1 Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is, I don’t know which half.

40|$|An {{important}} current {{trend in}} advertising is {{the replacement of}} traditional pay-per-exposure (pay-per-impression) pricing models with performance-based mechanisms in which advertisers pay only for measurable actions by consumers.

This work highlights an important, and hith-erto unrecognized, side-effect of PPA advertising.

Upward price distortions reduce both consumer surplus and the joint publisher-advertiser profit, leading to a net reduction in social welfare. They persist in current auction-based PPA mechanisms, {{such as the ones}} used by Google and Yahoo. In the latter settings they always reduce publisher revenues relative to pay-per-exposure methods. In extreme cases they also lead to rat-race situations where, in their effort to outbid one another, advertisers raise the prices of their products to the point where demand for them drops to zero. I show that these phenomena constitute a form of double marginalization and discuss a number of enhancements to today’s PPA mechanisms that restore equilibrium pricing of advertised goods to efficient levels...|$|E
40|$|Senior {{lodging and}} {{destination}} marketing executives often make vendor and marketing channel decisions without {{sufficient time to}} investigate the ROI of alternative strategies or emerging media choices. An internet-based survey of 426 marketing executives, drawn from the TravelCom 2011 conference and Cornell Center for Hospitality Research database, with support from Vantage Strategy and iPerceptions, found {{a wide range of}} expenditures on online marketing, as well as considerable diversity in organizational structures. Two-thirds of the sample comprised accommodation marketers, with the remainder being destination marketers or those responsible for other types of marketing. Nearly three-quarters of the respondents reported spending less than $ 10, 000 on mobile media in 2010, about two thirds spent less than $ 10, 000 on all social media marketing. About 80 percent of the marketers said that they produced Twitter campaigns and social promotions in-house, but such functions as search engine optimization and pay-per-click advertising are largely outsourced. Accommodation firms are more likely to outsource all social media functions, including <b>pay-per-call,</b> Twitter campaigns, and pay-per-click management. Destination marketers, on the other hand, generally handle more functions in-house. Two-thirds of the entire sample said the 2010 e-commerce budgets had increased with respect to 2009.

40|$|Preliminary and {{incomplete}} draft for consideration by workshop committee only. Please do not circulate. An important current trend in advertising is {{the replacement of}} traditional pay-per-exposure (some-times {{also referred to as}} pay-per-impression) pricing models, in which advertisers pay a lump sum for the privilege of exposing an audience of uncertain size and interests to their message, with performance-based mechanisms in which advertisers pay only for measurable actions by consumers. Such pay-per-action mechanisms are becoming the predominant method of selling advertising on the Internet. Well-known examples include pay-per-click, <b>pay-per-call</b> and pay-per-sale. This work highlights an important, and hitherto unrecognized shortcoming of pay-per-action advertising mechanisms. I find that, if the prices of advertised goods are endogenously determined by advertisers to maximize profits net of advertising expenses, pay-per-action advertising induces firms to distort the prices of their goods (usually upwards) relative to the prices that would maximize profits in settings where there is no advertising or where ad-vertising is sold under pay-per-exposure methods. Such price distortions reduce consumer surplus and one or both of advertiser profits publisher revenues, leading to a net reduction in social welfare. They persist even in current quality-weighted pay-per-action schemes, such as the ones used by Google and Yahoo. In the latter settings they always lead to lower publisher revenues relative to pay-per-exposure methods.
