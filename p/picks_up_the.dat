5|$|The cantata text {{does not}} tell a story but {{reflects}} {{different aspects of the}} Holy Spirit, celebrated on Pentecost. It begins with general praise, then concentrates on one line from the Gospel, addresses the Holy Trinity, refers to the Spirit that was present at the Creation, shows a dialogue between the Soul and the Spirit, and concludes with a stanza from Nicolai's hymn which <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> topic of unity between God (Spirit) and man, as shown in the dialogue. The text thus proceeds from general to more and more personal and intimate reflection.|$|E

5000|$|In {{order to}} ensure growth of only {{transformed}} bacteria (which carry the desired plasmids to be harvested), a marker gene {{is used in the}} destination vector for selection. Typical marker genes are for antibiotic resistance or nutrient biosynthesis. So, for example, the [...] "marker gene" [...] could be for resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin. If the bacteria that were supposed to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> desired plasmid had <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> desired gene then they would also contain the [...] "marker gene". Now <b>the</b> bacteria that <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> plasmid would be able to grow in ampicillin whereas the bacteria that did not <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> desired plasmid would still be vulnerable to destruction by the ampicillin.
