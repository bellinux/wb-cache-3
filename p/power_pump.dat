The pulse duration was compressed to 260 fs using 6 m high concentration E-r(3 +) -doped fiber under forward pumping. The amplified signal pulse energy was 0. 691 nJ (corresponding to a peak power of 2 657. 7 W) and the repetition rate was 20. 84 MHz. Spectrum breakup was observed simultaneously.

50|$|Three rafts were {{employed}} in the Pandanan excavation. The first raft was used to travel the generator for the SCUBA tank compressor and for supplying power to the submersible <b>power</b> <b>pump.</b> As for the second raft, {{it was used to}} carry and store diving gears and wet suits. The last raft served the role of lifting and delivering the artifacts that were obtained from the underwater site. Dredging systems were used to clear away the mud, sand and coral that covered the ship. Once artifacts have been lifted from the site, they were immediately put in a saltwater bath. This allowed the limestone and coral to keep its layers from being damaged. Archaeologists and Conservators then cautiously cleansed, tagged and put the recovered ceramics in a protective storage before it was sent to the National Museum.|$|E

5000|$|Exiting the tunnel, {{the sewage}} was pumped through Squantum Neck and reached holding tanks on Moon Island through another conduit {{placed under the}} {{embankment}} from Squantum to Moon Island. The sand and gravel needed to complete this project was stripped from Half Moon Island, a crescent-shaped island that was located {{near the mouth of}} Black's Creek in Quincy Bay. Four huge cut-granite storage tanks with a [...] capacity were built by the Cape Ann Granite Company to handle the sewage. These vats were formed by digging out the northern section of the hill and cementing and bricking the sides of the excavation. This reservoir was divided into four compartments, each with inlets and four outlets. The tanks were 900 by 150 ft and 17 ft deep. The bottoms were seven feet thick and were grooved to ease the removal of sludge. At one end was a gatehouse. The tank outlets were connected with a <b>power</b> <b>pump</b> and a turbine that was used to open the gates of the outflow pipe. The 12 ft diameter outflow conduit extended 600 ft into the harbor from the northern end of Moon Island. The Sewage Plant was completed in 1884 at a cost of $6-million.|$|E
