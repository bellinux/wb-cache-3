40|$|Abstract Background Some {{currently}} available birth weight for gestational age standards are customized {{but others are}} not. We carried out a study to provide empirical justification for customizing such standards by sex and for whites and blacks in the United States. Methods We studied all male and female singleton live births and stillbirths (22 or more weeks of gestation; 500 g birth weight or over) in the United States in 1997 and 1998. White and black singleton live births and stillbirths were also examined. Qualitative congruence between gestational age-specific growth restriction and <b>perinatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> {{was used as the}} criterion for identifying the preferred standard. Results The fetuses at risk approach showed that males had higher <b>perinatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> at all gestational ages compared with females. Gestational age-specific growth restriction rates based on a sex-specific standard were qualitatively consistent with gestational age-specific <b>perinatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> among males and females. However, growth restriction patterns among males and females based on a unisex standard could not be reconciled with <b>perinatal</b> <b>mortality</b> patterns. Use of a single standard for whites and blacks resulted in gestational age-specific growth restriction rates that were qualitatively congruent with patterns of <b>perinatal</b> <b>mortality,</b> while use of separate race-specific standards led to growth restriction patterns that were incompatible with patterns of <b>perinatal</b> <b>mortality.</b> Conclusion Qualitative congruence between growth restriction and <b>perinatal</b> <b>mortality</b> patterns provides an outcome-based justification for sex-specific birth weight for gestational age standards but not for the available race-specific standards for blacks and whites in the United States. </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>Perinatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> {{have dropped}} {{sharply in the}} past few decades, in the Netherlands as well as in all other European countries. However, as the {{decrease}} has generally slowed down since the 1980 s, the Netherlands has lost its prominent position in the international ranking of countries with favourable <b>perinatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates.</b> This lower ranking is not only the result of the dialectics of progress, but also the consequence of a relatively restrained use of antenatal diagnostics. In addition, the Netherlands is among the European countries scoring highest on a number of important risk factors. This article examines the effect on <b>perinatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> of known risk factors, in particular the presence of non-western foreigners, multiple births and older mothers. With respect to the latter factor, it is concluded that children of older mothers run a significantly higher risk of foetal mortality, whereas babies of young mothers (including women in their early twenties) run a higher risk of infant mortality. For babies of non-western mothers, infant <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> are higher, although there are substantial differences between ethnic backgrounds. First week mortality is most unfavourable for Surinamese and Antillean/Aruban children, and post-neonatal mortality is highest among Turkish and Moroccan babies. The fact that relatively many non-western foreigners from countries with relatively high risks of <b>perinatal</b> <b>mortality</b> have settled in the Netherlands, {{is one of the reasons}} for the fall in the international ranking.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{changes in}} the incidence of vaginal deliveries, cesarean sections, and forceps deliveries and their potential association with fetal, early neonatal, and <b>perinatal</b> <b>mortality</b> <b>rates</b> over time. METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out and the occurrence of deliveries supervised by university services between January 1991 and December 2000 was determined. Data regarding fetal, early neonatal, and perinatal deaths were assessed using obstetric and pediatric records and autopsy reports. RESULTS: Of a total of 33, 360 deliveries, the incidence of vaginal deliveries, cesarean sections, and forceps deliveries was relatively steady (around 60, 30, and 10 %, respectively) while, at the same time, there was a marked reduction in fetal mortality (from 33. 3 to 13. 0 ?), early neonatal mortality (from 30. 6 to 9. 0 ?), and <b>perinatal</b> <b>mortality</b> (from 56. 4 to 19. 3 ?).
