[...] This was the first <b>patent</b> <b>pool,</b> a process which enables the production of complicated machines without legal battles over patent rights. They agreed to form the Sewing Machine Combination, but for this to be of any use, they had to secure the cooperation of Elias Howe, who still held certain vital uncontested patents. Terms were arranged; Howe received a royalty on every sewing machine manufactured.|$|E

2500|$|Toulmin handled five patent {{applications}} for the Wright brothers {{over a period of}} 17 years, spurring more than 13 years of fierce legal battles over the intellectual property rights he helped to create. [...] As a result of Toulmin's success in keeping others from using the Wright brothers' ideas, aircraft manufacturers established the Aircraft Manufacturers Association to coordinate the World War I wartime aircraft manufacturing in the United States and formed a <b>patent</b> <b>pool</b> four months after the United States joined the war, in July, 1917, with the approval of the U.S. government. All patent litigation ceased automatically and royalties were reduced to one percent and free exchange of inventions and ideas took place among all the airframe builders.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} extent to which <b>patent</b> <b>pools</b> (agreements where <b>patent</b> holders agree to license their {{intellectual}} property as a package) could be used as an institution to facilitate technology transactions in biotechnology. <b>Patent</b> <b>pools</b> have been used with success in the consumer electronics and other sectors but they are untested in biotechnology despite their transaction cost reducing potential. We suggest two explanations for the fact that <b>patent</b> <b>pools</b> have not been used in this industry.

We then empirically examine the terms of 63 pools, and show that licensing rules are consistent with these hypotheses. ...|$|R

40|$|Studies have {{depicted}} {{that the}} rate of unused patents comprises a high portion of patents in North America, Europe and Japan. Particularly, studies have identified a considerable share of strategic patents which are left unused due to pure strategic reasons. While such patents might generate strategic rents to their owner, they may have harmful consequences for the society if by blocking alternative solutions that other inventions provide they hamper the possibility of better solutions. Accordingly, the importance of the issue of nonuse is highlighted within the literature on strategic patenting, IPR policy and innovation economics. Moreover, the current literature has emphasized on the role of <b>patent</b> <b>pools</b> in dealing with potential issues such as excessive transaction cost caused by patent thickets and blocking patents. In fact, <b>patent</b> <b>pools</b> have emerged as policy tools facilitating technology commercialization and alleviating patent litigation among rivals holding overlapping IPRs. In this dissertation I provide a critical literature review on strategic patenting, identify present gaps and discuss some future research paths. Moreover, I investigate the drivers of strategic non-use of patents with particular focus on unused strategic play patents. Finally, I examine if participation intensity in <b>patent</b> <b>pools</b> by pool members explains their willingness to use their non-pooled patents. I also investigate which characteristics of the <b>patent</b> <b>pools</b> are associated to the willingness to use non-pooled <b>patents</b> through <b>pool</b> participation. I show that technological uncertainty and technological complexity are two technology environment factors that drive unused play patents. I also show that pool members participating more intensively in <b>patent</b> <b>pools</b> {{are more likely to be}} willing to use their non-pooled <b>patents</b> through <b>pool</b> participation. I further depict that pool licensors are more likely to be willing to use their non-pooled patents by participating in pools with higher level of technological complementarity to their own technology...|$|R

40|$|The {{conventional}} antitrust {{wisdom is}} that the formation of <b>patent</b> <b>pools</b> is welfare enhanc-ing when patents are complementary, since the pool avoids a double-marginalization problem associated with independent licensing. The focus {{of this paper is}} on (downstream) product de-velopment and commercialization on the basis of perfectly complementary patents. We consider development technologies that entail spillovers between rivals, and assume that final demand products are imperfect substitutes. When pool formation facilitates information sharing and either increases spillovers in development or decreases the degree of product differentiation, <b>patent</b> <b>pools</b> can adversely affect welfare by reducing the incentives towards product devel-opment and product market competitionâeven with perfectly complementary patents.

40|$|<b>Patent</b> <b>pools,</b> {{which allow}} {{competing}} firms to combine their patents {{as if they}} are a single firm, have {{become one of the most}} prominent mechanisms to address problems with the current patent system.
