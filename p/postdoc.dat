After Peter Lauritz Sørensen had defined the logarithmic pH-scale and introduced the concept of buffering in 1909 the German chemist Leonor Michaelis and his Canadian <b>postdoc</b> Maud Leonora Menten repeated Henri's experiments and confirmed his equation, which is now generally referred to as Michaelis-Menten kinetics (sometimes also Henri-Michaelis-Menten kinetics). Their work was further developed by G. E. Briggs and J. B. S. Haldane, who derived kinetic equations that are still widely considered today a starting point in modeling enzymatic activity.|$|E

Using data on U.

We find evidence of weaker networks for foreign <b>postdocs,</b> who more often resort to “impersonal ” searches. The resulting difference in job match quality is related to differences in turnover, satisfaction, and productivity...|$|R

500|$|On December 2, 1957, at Yale University, Richards {{performed}} a simple experiment on the protein Ribonuclease A (RNase A) that helped change the scientific community's {{view of the}} physical nature of protein molecules. Using a particular protease (Subtilisin), RNase A was converted into a split protein (RNase S), which is composed of two parts called S-peptide and S-protein (...) [...] Richards had developed that cleavage system as a <b>postdoc</b> at the Carlsberg Laboratory in Copenhagen, Denmark, using purified ribonuclease protein that had been donated to Christian Anfinsen by the Armour Company and that Anfinsen shared with Richards and other researchers. Richards found that, when separated, S-protein and S-peptide had no RNase activity, but that the RNase enzymatic activity was restored when the parts were recombined in the test tube. In an autobiographical piece, Richards wrote that [...] "this discovery {{came as a surprise}} to the scientific community at that time.... In retrospect, this may have been the high point of my career in terms of excitement." [...] This experiment showed that proteins maintain 3-dimensional order and tight binding between their interacting parts and that the structural information is inherent in the protein itself, foreshadowing both Anfinsen's later work showing that sequence determines structure and also the idea that hormones or other small molecules can bind tightly and specifically to proteins, a concept basic to how pharmaceutical companies design drugs today. Two years later, the protein structure of myoglobin confirmed such specific 3D relationships. [...] Later, with Marilyn Doscher and Flo Quiocho, Richards demonstrated that ribonuclease S as well as carboxypeptidase were enzymatically active in the crystals, important evidence to silence doubts that the conformations of proteins in crystals are directly relevant to their biological activity in cells.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a qualitative}} investigation into international postdoctoral employment in life {{science and engineering}} fields at universities in the United States and United Kingdom. Data were gathered through 49 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with international <b>postdocs,</b> faculty members who have supervised international <b>postdocs</b> from abroad at two universities in the US and two universities in the UK. The number of postdoctoral appointments has increased dramatically over the past decade, as has the share of these appointees who come from aboard. Yet few studies have investigated what is underlying this growing trend. By examining interactions between structure and agency at local, global and national levels, this study explored the roles that international <b>postdocs</b> play in academic production and {{the process by which}} they become mobile. Theory on globalization, higher education policy and models of academic production guide this study. Findings show that international <b>postdocs</b> are becoming scientific employees, rather than trainees, who are incorporated into capitalist modes of academic production as low-cost, high-yield scientific workers. Universities and individual faculty members seek international <b>postdocs</b> because of their contributions to research production; however, few <b>postdocs</b> have the opportunity to move into tenure-tracked faculty jobs. For international <b>postdocs,</b> becoming mobile is an individual process that is often constructed by individuals who negotiate home country academic policies in a global academic market. Mobility is a multi-stage process that begins with the potential to become mobile and is realized by actual mobility, which occurs through a transnational space produced by international journals that define global science...|$|R

2500|$|As a {{doctoral}} student at Germany's University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Karlheinz Brandenburg began working on digital music compression in the early 1980s, focusing on how people perceive music. He completed his doctoral work in 1989. MP3 is directly descended from OCF and PXFM, representing {{the outcome of the}} collaboration of Brandenburg—working as a <b>postdoc</b> at AT Labs with James D. Johnston ("JJ") of AT Labs—with the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits, Erlangen (where he worked with Bernhard Grill and four other researchers – [...] "The Original Six"), with relatively minor contributions from the MP2 branch of psychoacoustic sub-band coders. In 1990, Brandenburg became an assistant professor at Erlangen-Nuremberg. While there, he continued to work on music compression with scientists at the Fraunhofer Society (in 1993 he joined the staff of the Fraunhofer Institute). The song [...] "Tom's Diner" [...] by Suzanne Vega was the first song used by Karlheinz Brandenburg to develop the MP3. Brandenburg adopted the song for testing purposes, listening to it again and again each time refining the scheme, making sure it did not adversely affect the subtlety of Vega's voice.|$|E

40|$|While {{postdoctoral}} researchers (<b>postdocs)</b> are {{an increasingly}} important and productive group of employees in academia, they lack further career prospects and embeddedness within their organizations. This paper provides a rare glimpse into this relatively unexplored but important group. A comparative study of two Dutch universities included a survey with both closed and open questions among 225 respondents. Our study reveals that nearly all <b>postdocs</b> (85 %) {{want to stay in}} the academic field, but only < 3 % was offered a tenure-track position. The uncertainty of their future prospects in academia lowered their job satisfaction; this is particularly true for the social sciences and humanities. Concerning alternative career paths, only few of the <b>postdocs</b> spent time in preparing for a career outside academia, and less than a third attempted to develop any transferable skills, although the importance of networking was recognized. Given that <b>postdocs</b> seem to be trapped between their own ambitions and a lack of academic career opportunities, it is very important that, on the one hand, <b>postdocs</b> aim for better visibility within their organizations, while on the other hand, universities provide more clarity and openness about their further career prospects inside and outside academia...|$|R

Despite the interest in IDPs from a policy perspective, there is little information about how they have been used. The authors ex-amined IDP awareness and use, the benefits of creating an IDP, and ways to facilitate its use by administering a survey to current or former postdoctoral researchers via the National Postdoctoral Association (NPA) and University of Alabama at Birmingham email lists; individuals belonging to Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology member societies who mentored postdocs; and postdoctoral administrators at member institutions of the Association of American Medical Colleges and the NPA. Although most postdoctoral administrators (> 80 %) were familiar with IDPs, less than 50 % of <b>postdocs</b> and only 20 % of mentors were aware of IDPs. For those <b>postdocs</b> and mentors who reported creating an IDP, the process helped <b>postdocs</b> to identify the skills and abilities necessary for career success and facilitated communication between <b>postdocs</b> and their mentors. Despite the fact that creating an IDP benefits <b>postdocs</b> and mentors, IDP use will likely remain low unless institutions and research mentors encourage trainees to engage in this process...|$|R
