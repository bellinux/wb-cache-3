The lines were actually invented for <b>publicity</b> <b>matter</b> that accompanied an earlier stage adaptation of Don Quixote by the American playwright Paul Kester, first performed in 1908. The phrase [...] "To each his Dulcinea", featured in Wasserman's play, was also first used in the Kester play.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{consists}} {{of a collection of}} material emanating from two, related, practice-as-research projects that I undertook between 2007 and 2012 in Glasgow, Scotland: Glimmers in Limbo (2007 - 08) and The River Clyde Project (2009 - 12). Included in the thesis is documentation of both projects in the form of photographs, video and sound recordings; three journal articles and a book chapter reflecting on the projects; a book/catalogue documenting and reflecting on Glimmers in Limbo and (as appendices) material relating to the public exhibition/performance of the works: invitations, programme notes, press and <b>publicity</b> <b>matter</b> and other research material. The body of work constitutes an exploration of human/environment inter-relations, through critical spatial or site-orientated practice. The earlier project, Glimmers in Limbo, focuses on the built environment and, specifically, on two contrasting but complementary sites that have played multiple roles in the social and cultural life of Glasgow, sites which can be understood as rich repositories of cultural memory and which are subject to competing interests and investments. The project investigates the potential of critical spatial practice, using ephemeral media such as projected imagery, sound and performance, to invite interpretations of these ‘heritage sites’ that are multiple and unresolved and to activate them as stimuli for diverse, overlapping memories. It considers the efficacy of transient artworks in resisting the fixing or monumentalisation of heritage sites and, thus, in offering resistance to single, authorative renderings of the past, which might serve to perpetuate dominant and exclusive ideologies. In the course of the investigation-through-practice, perceived distinctions between so-called tangible and intangible heritage are troubled. The later body of work, The River Clyde Project, focuses on Glasgow’s major river as it flows through the city, extending Glimmers in Limbo’s human-centric focus on the built environment, cultural memory and heritage. In The River Clyde Project, two contrasting but iterative pieces of critical spatial practice — Bridging Part 1 (2010) and High-Slack-Low-Slack-High (2012) — explore ideas of the urban, post-industrial river as a paradigm for natural-cultural or ecological-social exchange, using the lens of vital materialism to consider {{the ways in which the}} artworks reveal the waywardness of ‘natural’ phenomena and unsettle anthropocentric understandings of human/environment inter-relations. The River Clyde Project, in its engagement with expanded or extroverted ideas of site, also productively challenges seeming contradictions between notions of site-specificity and mobility...|$|E

Polish people have a separate and specific hierarchy of values and - as a society - they are more differenciated. That is why advertising must be addressed to possibly most numerous groups of population and not to all citizens.

40|$|Beckett and the Institution of Literature {{investigates the}} {{evolution}} of Samuel Beckett's reputation over {{the latter half of}} the twentieth century, focussing on two questions: what are the institutional frameworks and operations that have effected Beckett's work, and what effect has the work had on the institution of literature? The first half of the thesis explores Beckett's relationships with his French publisher, Editions de Minuit, in the 1950 s, and his English publisher, John Calder, in the 1960 s. By situating Beckett in institutional and historical contexts, the thesis seeks to avoid the uncritical acceptance of Beckett's consecration that underlies so much scholarly writing on his work. Archival evidence reveals the process by which Beckett was circulated and promoted, first, to an elite avant-garde readership, and thence to a wider public, and challenges the popular conception of Beckett as utterly uninterested in publication and <b>publicity</b> <b>matters.</b> The latter half of the thesis considers the legal and promotional (particularly visual) frames of reference by which Beckett is often characterised today. It is suggested that conflicts over staging rights, and the widespread use of a uniform image of Beckett to promote his work, are instrumental both in determining and in jeopardising the work's current cultural status. The thesis argues that the relation between Beckett's work and the literary institutions that have produced it is mutually transformative, and that the work has consistently challenged, exceeded, and disrupted the institution of literature. It is proposed that there are, however, indications that the public is tiring of Beckett's now familiar classic works, and so the thesis asks why it has come about that in being canonised the work has also been domesticated, what this means for the way we have been reading Beckett's texts, and whether there is anything to be done about it. </p...|$|R

If it cannot be whipped in any other way than through a war against slavery, let it come to that legitimately.

60|$|At first Lord Carteret {{considered}} it a thousand pities {{that they should not}} have contrived matters better so as to take Sir Richard alive; but upon reflection he was careful not to exaggerate to himself the loss occasioned by his death, for Sir Richard, after all, was a notoriously stubborn man, not in the least likely to have made any avowals worth having.

60|$|For {{these last}} citations, {{and some of}} the remarks, your Committee are indebted to the learned and upright Justice Foster. They have {{compared}} them with the Journals, and find them correct. The same excellent author proceeds to demonstrate that whatever he says of trials by impeachment is equally applicable to trials before the High Steward on indictment; and consequently, that there is no ground for a distinction, with regard to the public declaration of the Judges' opinions, founded on the inapplicability of either of these cases to the other. The argument on this whole matter is so satisfactory that your Committee has annexed it at large to their Report.[27] As there is no difference in fact between these trials, (especially since the act which provides that all the peers shall be summoned to the trial of a peer,) so there is no difference in the reason and principle of the <b>publicity,</b> let the <b>matter</b> of the Steward's jurisdiction, be as it may.|$|R

50|$|As a {{subsidiary}} of Harvard Student Agencies, Let's Go's charter states that the company may only employ degree-seeking Harvard students; because of this, Let's Go's business model is unique among publishers. Every year, a student management team is chosen from the previous year's staff. This core group works out of Let's Go's Cambridge offices all year round on the company's website, <b>publicity,</b> and editorial <b>matters.</b> Over the winter, the management team hires a staff of Editors, who in turn hire the company's traveling Researcher-Writers. Editors work part-time throughout the spring semester to prepare and train Researcher-Writers for their trips. After the semester ends, the Researcher-Writers leave Cambridge for their destination, while the Editors begin working full time at the Cambridge office. Researcher-Writers, traveling alone, typically spend from {{six to eight weeks}} of their summer (June-July) on the road, visiting the assigned establishments in their assigned cities and sending raw copy back to Cambridge. In order to keep the writing true to the budget heritage of the series, Researcher-Writers are paid a daily stipend intended to cover only basic expenses (although Let's Go does cover airfare to and from their destination). Meanwhile, Editors work throughout the entire summer, aiding the Researcher-Writers and editing the copy. The guides are assembled from the edited copy in August and September, and are released in bookstores the following winter—just as the publishing process for the next year's guides has begun.|$|R
40|$|Several online forums {{exist to}} {{facilitate}} open and/or anonymous {{discussion of the}} peer-reviewed scientific literature. Data integrity is a common discussion topic, and it is widely assumed that <b>publicity</b> surrounding such <b>matters</b> will accelerate correction of the scientific record. This study aimed to test this assumption by examining a collection of 497 papers for which data integrity had been questioned either in public or in private. As such, the papers {{were divided into two}} sub-sets: a public set of 274 papers discussed online, and the remainder a private set of 223 papers not publicized. The sources of alleged data problems, as well as criteria for defining problem data, and communication of problems to journals and appropriate institutions, were similar between the sets. The number of laboratory groups represented in each set was also similar (75 in public, 62 in private), as was the number of problem papers per laboratory group (3. 65 in public, 3. 54 in private). Over a study period of 18 months, public papers were retracted 6. 5 -fold more, and corrected 7. 7 -fold more, than those in the private set. Parsing the results by laboratory group, 28 laboratory groups in the public set had papers which received corrective action, versus 6 laboratory groups in the private set. For those laboratory groups in the public set with corrected/retracted papers, the fraction of their papers acted on was 62 % of those initially flagged, whereas in the private set this fraction was 27 %. Such clustering of actions suggests a pattern in which correction/retraction of one paper from a group correlates with more corrections/retractions from the same group, with this pattern being stronger in the public set. It is therefore concluded that online discussion enhances levels of corrective action in the scientific literature. Nevertheless, anecdotal discussion reveals substantial room for improvement in handling of such matters...|$|R
60|$|My Lords, having thus {{seen what}} {{the duty of}} a judge is in such a case, let us examine whether Mr. Hastings {{observed}} {{any part of the}} prescribed rules. First, with regard to the <b>publicity</b> of the <b>matter.</b> Did he ever give any notice to the Supreme Council of the charges which he says he had received against Cheyt Sing? Did he accuse the Rajah in the Council, even when it was reduced to himself and his poor, worn, down, cowed, and I am afraid bribed colleague, Mr. Wheler? Did he even then, I ask, produce any one charge against this man? He sat in Council as a judge,--as an English judge,--as a Mahometan judge,--as a judge by the Gentoo law, and by the Law of Nature. He should have summoned the party to appear in person, or by his attorney, before him, and should have there informed him of the charge against him. But, my Lords, he did not act thus. He kept the accusation secret in his own bosom. And why? Because he did not believe it to be true. This may at least be inferred from his having never informed the Council of the matter. He never informed the Rajah of Benares of the suspicions entertained against him, during the discussions which took place respecting the multiplied demands that were made upon him. He never told this victim, as he has had the audacity to tell us and all this kingdom in the paper that is before your Lordships, that he looked upon these refusals to comply with his demands to be overt acts of rebellion; nor did he ever call upon him to answer or to justify himself with regard to that imputed conspiracy or rebellion. Did he tell Sadanund, the Rajah's agent, when that agent was giving him a bribe or a present in secret, and was thus endeavoring to deprecate his wrath, that he accepted that bribe because his master was in rebellion? Never, my Lords; nor did he, when he first reached Benares, and had the Rajah in his power, suggest one word concerning this rebellion. Did he, when he met Mr. Markham at Boglipore, where they consulted about the destruction of this unhappy man, did he tell Mr. Markham, or did Mr. Markham insinuate to him, any one thing about this conspiracy and rebellion? No, not a word there, or in his whole progress up the country. While at Boglipore, he wrote a letter to Lord Macartney upon the state of the empire, giving him much and various advice. Did he insinuate in that letter that he was going up to Benares to suppress a rebellion of the Rajah Cheyt Sing or to punish him? No, not a word. Did he, my Lords, at the eve of his departure from Calcutta, when he communicated his intention of taking 500,000l., which he calls a fine or penalty, from the Rajah, did he inform Mr. Wheler of it? No, not a word of his rebellion, nor anything like it. Did he inform his secret confidants, Mr. Anderson and Major Palmer, upon that subject? Not a word, there was not a word dropped from him of any such rebellion, or of any intention in the Rajah Cheyt Sing to rebel. Did he, when he had vakeels in every part of the Mahratta empire and in the country of Sujah Dowlah, when he had in most of those courts English ambassadors and native spies, did he either from ambassadors or spies receive anything like authentic intelligence upon this subject? While he was at Benares, he had in his hands Benaram Pundit, the vakeel of the Rajah of Berar, his own confidential friend, a person whom he took out of the service of his master, and to whom he gave a jaghire in this very zemindary of Benares. This man, so attached to Mr. Hastings, so knowing in all the transactions of India, neither accused Cheyt Sing of rebellious intentions, or furnished Mr. Hastings with one single proof that any conspiracy with any foreign power existed.|$|R
