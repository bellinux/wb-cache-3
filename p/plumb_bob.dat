5|$|Since {{the first}} modern {{measurements}} of the precise cardinal orientations of the pyramids by Flinders Petrie, various astronomical methods have been proposed for the original establishment of these orientations. It was recently proposed that this was done by observing the positions of two stars in the Plough / Big Dipper which was known to Egyptians as the thigh. It is thought that a vertical alignment between these two stars checked with a <b>plumb</b> <b>bob</b> was used to ascertain where north lay. The deviations from true north using this model reflect the accepted dates of construction.|$|E

5000|$|The cave {{consists}} of Chert (known as the Lost River Chert), which is overlaid by the Ste. Genevieve Limestone and St. Louis Limestone, {{both of which}} were laid down in the middle to late Mississippian Period. The river appears above ground in three short sections before flowing into the mouth of the cave. The most interesting section is the blue hole, which is the cause of the Lost River being listed by Ripley's Believe it or Not as the [...] "Shortest, deepest river in the world." [...] <b>Plumb</b> <b>bobs</b> indicated that the blue hole was 437 feet deep, while the river itself is only 400 feet long. In fact, the blue hole is only 16 feet deep, but is linked to a further underground river. This caused <b>plumb</b> <b>bobs</b> to be swept underground, returning erroneous measurements.|$|R

2500|$|An {{important}} {{application of}} the knowledge that atmospheric pressure varies directly with altitude was in determining the height of hills and mountains thanks to the availability of reliable pressure measurement devices. While in 1774 Maskelyne was confirming Newton's theory of gravitation at and on Schiehallion in Scotland (using <b>plumb</b> <b>bob</b> deviation to show the effect of [...] "gravity") and accurately measure elevation, William Roy using barometric pressure was able to confirm his height determinations, the agreement being to within one meter (3.28 feet). This was then {{a useful tool for}} survey work and map making and long has continued to be useful. It was part of the [...] "application of science" [...] which gave practical people the insight that applied science could easily and relatively cheaply be [...] "useful".|$|E
2500|$|A perfect {{sphere of}} uniform mass density, or whose density varies solely with {{distance}} from the centre (spherical symmetry), would produce a gravitational field of uniform magnitude at all points on its surface, always pointing directly towards the sphere's centre. The Earth is not spherically symmetric, but is slightly flatter at the poles while bulging at the Equator: an oblate spheroid. There are consequently slight deviations in both the magnitude and direction of gravity across its surface. [...] The net force (or corresponding net acceleration) as measured by a scale and <b>plumb</b> <b>bob</b> is called [...] "effective gravity" [...] or [...] "apparent gravity". [...] Effective gravity includes other factors that affect the net force. [...] These factors vary and include things such as centrifugal force at the surface from the Earth's rotation and the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun.|$|E

50|$|Sight-Size is {{a method}} of drawing and {{painting}} an object exactly as it appears to the artist, on a one-to-one scale. The artist first sets a vantage point where the subject and the drawing surface {{appear to be the}} same size. Then, using a variety of measuring tools—which can include levels, mirrors, <b>plumb</b> <b>bobs,</b> strings, and sticks—the artist draws the subject so that, when viewed from the set vantage point, the drawing and the subject have exactly the same dimensions. When properly done, sight-size drawing can result in extremely accurate and realistic drawings. It {{can also be used to}} draw the exact dimensions for a model in preparation for a painting.|$|R
50|$|Similar {{to modern}} spirit levels, the Chorobates {{consisted}} of a beam of wood 6 m in length held by 2 supporting legs and equipped with 2 plumb lines at each end. The legs were joined to the beam by two diagonal rods with carved notches. If the notches corresponding to the plumb lines matched on both sides, it showed that the beam was level. On top of the beam, a groove or channel was carved. If the condition was too windy for the <b>plumb</b> <b>bobs</b> to work effectively, the surveyor could pour water into the groove and measure the plane by checking the water level.|$|R

Based on the surveys of this {{structure}} that {{have been carried out}} by Flinders Petrie and others, the slopes of the faces of this monument were a seked of 5 1/2, or 5 palms and 2 digits figure above which equates to a slope of 51.84° from the horizontal, using the modern 360 degree system. This slope would probably have been accurately applied during construction by way of 'A frame' shaped wooden tools with <b>plumb</b> <b>bobs,</b> marked to the correct incline, so that slopes could be measured out and checked efficiently.|$|R
5|$|The Egyptians worked {{deposits}} {{of the lead}} ore galena at Gebel Rosas to make net sinkers, <b>plumb</b> <b>bobs,</b> and small figurines. Copper {{was the most important}} metal for toolmaking in ancient Egypt and was smelted in furnaces from malachite ore mined in the Sinai. Workers collected gold by washing the nuggets out of sediment in alluvial deposits, or by the more labor-intensive process of grinding and washing gold-bearing quartzite. Iron deposits found in upper Egypt were utilized in the Late Period. High-quality building stones were abundant in Egypt; the ancient Egyptians quarried limestone all along the Nile valley, granite from Aswan, and basalt and sandstone from the wadis of the eastern desert. Deposits of decorative stones such as porphyry, greywacke, alabaster, and carnelian dotted the eastern desert and were collected even before the First Dynasty. In the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods, miners worked {{deposits of}} emeralds in Wadi Sikait and amethyst in Wadi el-Hudi.|$|R
40|$|Dear Sir or Madam, My name is David Longman and I {{am looking}} a {{position}} in race engineering, engineering design or race mechanics. Over the last 10 years, I have combined my motorsports experience with formal education to enhance my race engineering design skills. I am currently working as an engineer at Porter's Fabrications, a multi-million dollar manufacturing facility. On a daily basis I deal with complex engineering drawings which require prototype construction and I determine the methods for manufacturing. These methods include laser cutting, bending/forming, machining, welding and powder coating. I graduated from UNC-Charlotte {{with a degree in}} mechanical engineering, physics, a math minor and a concentration in motorsports. Having this vast amount of education has helped me with my problem solving skills and knowing where to look for answers. In my senior year, I designed and built a revolutionary alignment rig for the Formula SAE car. The rigs accuracy was based on the true axis of wheel rotation not on how true parts where machined. This allowed the user to measure toe and camber free wheel or tool defects. Lastly, I used system of conveyor rollers, wheel plates, <b>plumb</b> <b>bobs</b> and corner weight scales {{for the rest of the}} rig...|$|R

40|$|Moving and {{interacting}} with the environment require a reference for orientation and a scale for calibration in space and time. There is {{a wide variety of}} environmental clues and calibrated frames at different locales, but the reference of gravity is ubiquitous on Earth. The pull of gravity on static objects provides a plummet which, together with the horizontal plane, defines a three-dimensional Cartesian frame for visual images. On the other hand, the gravitational acceleration of falling objects can provide a time-stamp on events, because the motion duration of an object accelerated by gravity over a given path is fixed. Indeed, since ancient times, man has been using <b>plumb</b> <b>bobs</b> for spatial surveying, and water clocks or pendulum clocks for time keeping. Here we review behavioral evidence in favor of the hypothesis that the brain is endowed with mechanisms that exploit the presence of gravity to estimate the spatial orientation and the passage of time. Several visual and non-visual (vestibular, haptic, visceral) cues are merged to estimate the orientation of the visual vertical. However, the relative weight of each cue is not fixed, but depends on the specific task. Next, we show that an internal model of the effects of gravity is combined with multisensory signals to time the interception of falling objects, to time the passage through spatial landmarks during virtual navigation, to assess the duration of a gravitational motion, and to judge the naturalness of periodic motion under gravity...|$|R

Sometimes, the instrument and the tripod have to be moved bodily for centring. It must {{be noted that}} the centering and leveling of instrument is done recursively. Finally, exact centring is done by using the shifting head of the instrument. During this, first the screw-clamping ring of the shifting head is loosened and the upper plate of the shifting head is slid over the lower one until the <b>plumb</b> <b>bob</b> is exactly over the station mark. After the exact centring, the screw clamping ring gets tightened.|$|E
