5|$|The {{first phase}} of Southtown Center opened on November 3, 1960, with two more phases {{proceeding}} in 1963 and 1964. The mall is <b>partially</b> <b>enclosed,</b> {{while the majority of}} the center contains open air structures. Several additional buildings were constructed on the property throughout the years, while minimal renovations took place to maintain the mall's appearance.|$|E
5|$|The Acors Barns House {{is located}} in New London, Connecticut. Built in 1837, the Acors Barns House is a two-and-one half story Greek Revival house with a gable roof and clapboarded exterior. The front facade {{of the house is}} five bays wide with a Greek Revival portico leading to the main entrance. Additions to the house include a {{projecting}} center dormer, and second-story projection over a <b>partially</b> <b>enclosed</b> veranda. The plain exterior is contrasted by interior's elaborate hall ceilings, detailed woodwork and arched marble fireplaces.|$|E

50|$|A {{full fairing}} {{is a large}} {{front-mounted}} fairing, {{and should not be}} confused with cabin motorcycle or streamliner motorcycle fairings which fully or <b>partially</b> <b>enclose</b> the entire motorcycle.|$|R
50|$|Vaccinium vitis-idaea {{differs from}} the related {{cranberries}} in having white flowers with petals <b>partially</b> <b>enclosing</b> the stamens and stigma, rather than pink flowers with petals reflexed backwards, and rounder, less pear-shaped berries.|$|R
5|$|Details of {{the fruit}} bodies' appearance, color in particular, are {{somewhat}} variable and dependent on growing conditions. For example, specimens growing on logs in oak and hickory forests in the spring {{tend to have more}} yellowish-white, depressed caps than those found in the same location in autumn, which are light yellow brown and more convex in shape. The fruit body development of M.rotula is hemiangiocarpous, with an hymenium that is only <b>partially</b> <b>enclosed</b> by basidiocarp tissues. Robert Kühner showed that a -like tissue covers the young gills before the expanding cap breaks away from the stem. In unfavorable weather conditions, however, the mushrooms may fail to develop normally and instead produce semi-gasteroid basidiocarps.|$|E
5|$|Much of the Leslie's unique tone {{is due to}} {{the fact}} that the system is at least <b>partially</b> <b>enclosed,</b> whereby linear louvres along the sides and front of the unit can vent the sound from within the box after the sound has bounced around inside, {{mellowing}} it. The crossover is deliberately set to 800Hz to give the optimum balance between the horn and the drum, and is considered an integral part of the speaker. The tone is also affected by the wood used. Tone differences, due to cost cutting using particle board for speaker and rotor shelves instead of the previous plywood, are evident in the Leslie's sound. The thinner ply of the top of the cabinet adds a certain resonance as well. Like an acoustic instrument, a Leslie's tone is uniquely defined by its cabinet design and construction, the amplifier, crossover and speakers used, and the motors — not merely by the spinning of rotors.|$|E
25|$|Coral lagoons: Many of {{the islands}} in the Maldives have subsided, leaving lagoons wholly or <b>partially</b> <b>enclosed</b> by a ring of coral (see {{diagrams}} below right). These lagoons teem with reef fish and other aquatic life.|$|E
50|$|The simpler {{structure}} {{is found in}} jawless fish, in which the cranium is represented by a trough-like basket of cartilaginous elements only <b>partially</b> <b>enclosing</b> the brain, and associated with the capsules for the inner ears and the single nostril.

25|$|The {{drive was}} on the {{trailing}} wheels and the slide bars were attached to a motion bracket just behind the leading wheels. The wheels themselves had twelve spokes and very large balance weights. The front pair of wheels of the engine were <b>partially</b> <b>enclosed</b> in splashers which did not come above the running plate.|$|E
25|$|The {{concrete}} {{surface of}} the platforms is smooth, {{in contrast to the}} rough bush-hammered finish preferred elsewhere on the IRT Dual System stations. Corrugated metal windscreens are located {{along the length of the}} side platforms, which have also been enclosed in plywood. The west side has been <b>partially</b> <b>enclosed</b> to serve as station rooms. They are covered in steel frame canopies with truss supports and wooden-slat gabled roofs and lit by fluorescent fixtures.|$|E
5000|$|Later {{lanterns}} {{such as the}} Hot Blast and Cold Blast lanterns {{took this}} airflow control even further by <b>partially</b> <b>enclosing</b> the wick in a [...] "deflector" [...] or [...] "burner cone" [...] and channeling the airflow through that restricted area creating a brighter and even more stable flame.|$|R
5000|$|The B was {{powered by}} a [...] Siemens-Halske Sh.I nine {{cylinder}} rotary engine, driving a two blade propeller and housed within a <b>partially</b> <b>enclosing,</b> oil deflecting cowling. Behind it the fuselage was flat sided. The aircraft had a conventional undercarriage with mainwheels on a single axle supported on V-form struts.|$|R
50|$|Quercus depressipes {{is a type}} of live oak. It is a shrubby evergreen, growing {{only one}} meter (40 inches) tall, with {{leathery}} oval leaves.

25|$|The Power & Light District is {{immediately}} {{to the west of}} the Sprint Center. The district was named after the art deco Kansas City Power and Light Building. The present headquarters of the Kansas City Power & Light Company (a subsidiary of Great Plains Energy) is also located on the northern side of the district. A one-block entertainment area within the district is called Kansas City Live!, and contains two floors of bars and restaurants, as well as a large, <b>partially</b> <b>enclosed</b> courtyard and concert venue.|$|E
25|$|The reed on the dulcian {{is fully}} exposed, {{allowing}} the player {{to control the}} sound and intonation by embouchure. At the time it first appeared, other double reed instruments either had the reed fully enclosed, like the crumhorn or the bagpipe, or <b>partially</b> <b>enclosed</b> by a pirouette, like the shawm. It has been argued the dulcian displaced the bass shawm, on account of its more convenient size, {{but it has also}} been argued that the two co-existed and that the bass shawm appeared {{at about the same time}} as the bass dulcian.|$|E
25|$|Whereas the {{original}} {{mouth of the}} Singapore River emptied into Singapore Straits and its southern islands before major land reclamation took place, the Singapore River now empties into Marina Bay - an area of water <b>partially</b> <b>enclosed</b> by the reclamation work. The Port of Singapore is now located {{to the west of}} the island, using most of the south-west coast, and passenger ships to Singapore now typically berth at the Singapore Cruise Centre at Harbourfront. Thus the Singapore River's economic role has shifted away from one that of trade, towards more a role accommodated for tourism and aesthetics for the commercial zone which encloses it.|$|E
50|$|Built in the 1970s, {{this is not}} {{actually}} a quadrangle, but an L-shaped building <b>partially</b> <b>enclosing</b> an area of garden. The upper floors are predominantly student residences, but ground floor contains communal facilities including the college bar, games room, TV room, DVD room and JCR. The Prestwich, Larkin and Graves rooms are multi-purpose and used {{for a variety of}} events.|$|R
50|$|To {{maintain}} their inherent accuracy and ensure long life, great care {{is needed to}} avoid contamination with dirt and abrasive particles. This may be achieved by using rubber or leather bellows to completely or <b>partially</b> <b>enclose</b> the working surfaces. Another solution {{is to use a}} positive pressure of filtered air when they are used in a semi-sealed or open enclosure.|$|R
25|$|A large {{formation}} of mesas on the Sibley Peninsula in Lake Superior which resembles a reclining giant {{has become a}} symbol of the city. Sibley peninsula <b>partially</b> <b>encloses</b> the waters of Thunder Bay, and dominates the view of the lake from the northern section of the city (formerly Port Arthur). The Sleeping Giant also figures on the city's coat of arms and the city flag.|$|R
25|$|Rather than {{a sudden}} decline in sea level, {{intermittent}} periods of ocean-bottom hyperoxia and anoxia (high-oxygen and low- or zero-oxygen conditions) {{may have caused}} the 13C/12C ratio fluctuations in the Early Triassic; and global anoxia may {{have been responsible for}} the end-Permian blip. The continents of the end-Permian and early Triassic were more clustered in the tropics than they are now, and large tropical rivers would have dumped sediment into smaller, <b>partially</b> <b>enclosed</b> ocean basins at low latitudes. Such conditions favor oxic and anoxic episodes; oxic/anoxic conditions would result in a rapid release/burial, respectively, of large amounts of organic carbon, which has a low 13C/12C ratio because biochemical processes use the lighter isotopes more. That or another organic-based reason may have been responsible for both that and a late Proterozoic/Cambrian pattern of fluctuating 13C/12C ratios.|$|E
25|$|A {{map of the}} Stadsholmen {{from the}} 1650s, {{illustrates}} de la Vallées suggestion for {{the conversion of the}} old castle. The project also brought about an adjustment of the Slottsbacken, making it <b>partially</b> <b>enclosed</b> by buildings. Of interest are Tessin the Younger's additions in pencil on that map, probably made {{at the end of the}} 17th century. There is an early sketch for the northern facade's west wing and the two curved wings enclosing the outer courtyard (both executed). Tessin the Younger also made plans for the city area west of the palace with large stairs in false perspective where the Axel Oxenstierna palace, among other buildings, are and joining the Västerlånggatan in addition to a wide street to the present Mynttorget, straight though the city block with the present Brantingtorget (not executed). He had envisioned a line of sight from the center of the palace, westwards to the Riddarholmen.|$|E

50|$|The Soviet War Memorial in Vienna, more {{formally}} {{known as}} the Heldendenkmal der Roten Armee (Heroes' Monument of the Red Army) is located at Vienna's Schwarzenbergplatz. The semi-circular white marble colonnade <b>partially</b> <b>enclosing</b> a twelve-metre figure of a Red Army Soldier was unveiled in 1945. The Heroes' Monument of the Red Army in Vienna was built to commemorate 17,000 Soviet soldiers {{who were killed in}} action during the Vienna Offensive in World War II.|$|R
500|$|Men from CCC Camp S-88-Pa, {{based at}} nearby Lyman Run in Potter County, were also {{active in the}} park. In 1939, they built a {{structure}} at Cherry Springs which is [...] "the largest and most unique of the CCC-built picnic pavilions" [...] in the state, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The pavilion overlooks PA Route 44and is shaped like an H, with two <b>partially</b> <b>enclosed</b> structures (the vertical lines of the H) connected by a breezeway (the horizontal bar). The breezeway is a roof supported by eight log columns with log railings. The ends of the pavilion are built from log walls with white chinking, like log cabins. Each end has a large opening to the breezeway in one wall, while the other three sides are fully enclosed with a large window in the wall facing the highway, a stone fireplace and chimney on the opposite wall, and a door flanked by windows on the wall opposite the breezeway.|$|E
