5|$|A 2012 {{study on}} the effects of {{rainfall}} <b>patterns</b> <b>and</b> parasite infections on the body of the springbok in Etosha National Park observed that males and juveniles were in better health {{toward the end of the}} rainy season. Health of females was more affected by parasites than by rainfall; parasite count in females peaked prior to and immediately after parturition. Studies show that springbok host helminths (Haemonchus, Longistrongylus and Trichostrongylus), ixodid ticks (Rhipicephalus species), lice (Damalinia and Linognathus species). Eimeria species mainly affect juveniles.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we extend the wordlength <b>pattern</b> <b>and</b> minimum {{aberration}} for non-regular factorials. The new concepts, the generalized wordlength <b>pattern</b> <b>and</b> minimum generalized aberration, are proposed. Some {{connections between the}} generalized wordlength <b>pattern</b> <b>and</b> uniformity are given. Some applications of the new concepts in the Blackett and Burman's designs are discussed...|$|R

5|$|A study – {{conducted}} by He et al. – used a mechanistic modelling approach {{to study the}} three waves of the 1918 influenza pandemic. They tried to study the factors that underlie variability in temporal <b>patterns,</b> <b>and</b> the patterns of mortality and morbidity. Their analysis suggests that temporal variations in transmission rate provide the best explanation and the variation in transmission required to generate these three waves is within biologically plausible values.|$|E
5|$|Animals such as chameleon, frog, {{flatfish}} such as {{the peacock}} flounder, squid and octopus actively change their skin <b>patterns</b> <b>and</b> colours using special chromatophore cells to resemble their current background, or, as in most chameleons, for signalling. However, Smith's dwarf chameleon does use active colour change for camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Because {{strontium}} is {{so similar}} to calcium, it {{is incorporated in}} the bone. All four stable isotopes are incorporated, in roughly the same proportions they are found in nature. However, the actual distribution of the isotopes tends to vary greatly from one geographical location to another. Thus, analyzing the bone of an individual can help determine the region it came from. This approach helps to identify the ancient migration <b>patterns</b> <b>and</b> the origin of commingled human remains in battlefield burial sites.|$|E
40|$|The Australian <b>Pattern</b> <b>and</b> Structure Mathematical Awareness Project {{was founded}} on the {{conviction}} that young children are more mathematically capable than previously thought and that pedagogy in early mathematics can promote generalisation. Through an innovative approach based on promoting awareness of <b>pattern</b> <b>and</b> structure, children could be challenged to think mathematically much earlier, making abstractions and generalisations that {{would enable them to}} understand and connect mathematical concepts more deeply. Two outcomes are the <b>Pattern</b> <b>and</b> Structure Assessment interview (PASA) <b>and</b> the <b>Pattern</b> <b>and</b> Structure Mathematics Awareness Program (PASMAP). In this paper, we focus on PASMAP pedagogy and tasks for students aged 5 to 7 years in order to illustrate the range of structural development. 11 page(s...|$|R

5|$|Climate {{scientists}} have {{hypothesized that the}} jet stream will gradually weaken {{as a result of}} global warming. Trends such as Arctic sea ice decline, reduced snow cover, evapotranspiration <b>patterns,</b> <b>and</b> other weather anomalies are expected to make the Arctic heat up faster than other parts of the globe. This in turn reduces the temperature gradient that drives jet stream winds, causing the jet stream to become weaker and more variable in its course.|$|E
5|$|Climatic shifts {{may affect}} tornadoes via teleconnections in {{shifting}} the jet stream {{and the larger}} weather patterns. The climate-tornado link is confounded by the forces affecting larger <b>patterns</b> <b>and</b> by the local, nuanced nature of tornadoes. Although {{it is reasonable to}} suspect that global warming may affect trends in tornado activity, any such effect is not yet identifiable due to the complexity, local nature of the storms, and database quality issues. Any effect would vary by region.|$|E
5|$|Community ecology is {{the study}} of the {{interactions}} among a collections of species that inhabit the same geographic area. Community ecologists study the determinants of <b>patterns</b> <b>and</b> processes for two or more interacting species. Research in community ecology might measure species diversity in grasslands in relation to soil fertility. It might also include the analysis of predator-prey dynamics, competition among similar plant species, or mutualistic interactions between crabs and corals.|$|E

5|$|Don't Look Now {{is renowned}} for its {{innovative}} editing style and its use of recurring motifs and themes and for a controversial sex scene that was explicit for its time. The film often employs flashbacks and flashforwards {{in keeping with the}} depiction of precognition, but some scenes are intercut or merged to alter the viewer's perception of what is really happening. It adopts an impressionist approach to its imagery, often presaging events with familiar objects, <b>patterns</b> <b>and</b> colours using associative editing techniques.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the three}} climactic eruptions {{released}} vast amounts of ash that blanketed much of central North America, falling many hundreds of miles away.

SRI selected a larger site in Anaheim, prepared reports about operation, and provided on-site administrative support, and acted in an advisory {{role as the}} park expanded. In 1955, SRI was commissioned to select a site and provide design suggestions for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.|$|E
5|$|Large-scale {{irrigation}} {{was introduced}} to the San Joaquin Valley in the late 19th century, and led to the construction of numerous state, federal and privately owned dams, which blocked migrating salmon and caused a large decline in riparian habitat. Diversion of water for irrigation often reduces the river to a small stream by the time it reaches its mouth. Efforts to mitigate environmental damage include habitat conservation work, re-establishment of historic streamflow <b>patterns,</b> <b>and</b> the construction of a salmon hatchery.|$|E
5|$|Lepidopterans {{are soft}} bodied, fragile and almost defenseless while the {{immature}} stages move slowly or are immobile, hence all stages {{are exposed to}} predation by birds, small mammals, lizards, amphibians, invertebrate predators (notably parasitoid and parasitic wasps and flies) as well as fungi and bacteria. To combat this, Lepidoptera have developed a number of strategies for defense and protection which include camouflage, aposematism, mimicry, {{and the development of}} threat <b>patterns</b> <b>and</b> displays.|$|E

While ascending the mountain, the player passes through themed biomes, such as forest, desert, and snow, and each {{section of the}} mountain introduces new enemies that force the player to modify their strategy. TumbleSeed is depicted in a simple, colorful art style. Its characters are one-eyed, seed-shaped creatures who occasionally have hats. Their dialogue is visualized with speech bubbles, in text and emoji. Additionally, TumbleSeed includes other features including quests, leaderboards, and daily challenges.|$|E
5|$|Surviving {{stone and}} wood carvings, wall {{paintings}} and tapestries suggest {{the richness of}} sixteenth century royal art. At Stirling Castle, stone carvings on the royal palace from the reign of James V are taken from German <b>patterns,</b> <b>and</b> like the surviving carved oak portrait roundels from the King's Presence Chamber, known as the Stirling Heads, they include contemporary, biblical and classical figures. Scotland's ecclesiastical art paid a heavy toll {{as a result of}} Reformation iconoclasm, with the almost total loss of medieval stained glass, religious sculpture and paintings. The parallel loss of patronage created a crisis for native craftsmen and artists, who turned to secular patrons. One result of this was the flourishing of Scottish Renaissance painted ceilings and walls, with large numbers of private houses of burgesses, lairds and lords gaining often highly detailed and coloured <b>patterns</b> <b>and</b> scenes, of which over a hundred examples survive. These include the ceiling at Prestongrange, undertaken in 1581 for Mark Kerr, Commendator of Newbattle, and the long gallery at Pinkie House, painted for Alexander Seaton, Earl of Dunfermline, in 1621. These were undertaken by unnamed Scottish artists using continental pattern books that often led to the incorporation of humanist moral and philosophical symbolism, with elements that call on heraldry, piety, classical myths and allegory.|$|E
