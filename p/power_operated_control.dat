30|$|In this paper, {{reactive}} power output capacity and control capability of PV plants, using inverters without other compensating device, are theoretically analyzed. The maximum capacity and inductive {{reactive power}} control are tested using a 30 MW PV power plant and compared with theoretical value. Voltage control and <b>power</b> factor <b>control</b> <b>operating</b> modes are demonstrated. A new testing method is proposed which combines the AVC system and an {{on-load tap changer}} to make voltage disturbances to verify voltage control mode.|$|R
50|$|In late 1973 {{and early}} 1974 the track layout was {{simplified}} and the manual signal box was removed in early 1990, {{along with other}} manual signal boxes on this line, and its function replaced by colour light signalling and <b>power</b> <b>operated</b> points, both <b>controlled</b> from Marylebone. The track alignments were improved to allow higher speed running at the junction for the services from Marylebone, and the pointwork which had allowed trains from Paddington to call at the westbound Chiltern station platform was removed. All eastbound services were moved to the former through road; the eastbound road, which had formerly extended from the platform road at West Ruislip, was closed and lifted, and the eastbound platform widened. The alignment of the turnout towards Marylebone was improved to allow higher-speed running. Fragments of the old trackwork can still be seen {{to the north of}} the line at this point. The trackwork at this station has been upgraded and now permits higher speed running up to 100 mph.|$|R

As a result the physical four-layer model of pin-diode has been confirmed. Non-linear properties of pin-diode with the big amplitude of SHF-signal have been explained. Characteristics of solid-state controlling devices have been improved. The threshold and leakage powers have been decreased.

5000|$|The RCIC system {{operates}} on high-pressure steam from the reactor itself, {{and thus is}} operable with no electric power other than battery <b>power</b> to <b>operate</b> the <b>control</b> valves. Those turn the RCIC on and off as necessary to maintain correct water levels in the reactor. (If run continuously, the RCIC would overfill the reactor and send water down its own steam supply line.) During a station blackout (where all off-site power is lost and the diesel generators fail) the RCIC system may be [...] "black started" [...] with no AC and manually activated. The RCIC system condenses its steam into the reactor suppression pool. The RCIC can make up this water loss, from either of two sources: a makeup water tank located outside containment, or the wetwell itself. RCIC is not designed to maintain reactor water level during a LOCA or other leak. Similar to HPCI, the RCIC turbine can be run in recirculation mode to remove steam from the reactor and help depressurize the reactor.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} an N ×N input-queued switch with a crossbarbased switching fabric implemented {{on a single}} chip. The power consumption produced by the crossbar chip and due to the data transfer grows as NR 3, where R is the maximum bit rate. Thus, at increasing bit rate, power dissipation {{is becoming more and}} more challenging, limiting the crossbar scalability for high performance switches. We propose to exploit Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) techniques to control packet transmissions through each crosspoint of the switching fabric. Our <b>power</b> <b>control</b> <b>operates</b> independently of the packet scheduler and exploits the knowledge of a traffic matrix obtained by on-line measurements. We propose a family of control algorithms to reduce the power consumption. The algorithms are particularly efficient in non-overloaded conditions. The actual potential of the proposed approach is also evaluated on a real design case synthesized on a 90 nm CMOS technology. Index Terms—Input queued switch, power control, dynamic voltage frequency scaling. ...|$|R
50|$|With the {{practical}} development of electric power, {{the complexity of}} a signal box was no longer limited by the distance a mechanical lever could work a set of points or a semaphore signal via a direct physical connection (or the space required by such connections). <b>Power</b> <b>operated</b> switch points and signalling decides greatly expanded the territory that a single <b>control</b> point could <b>operate</b> from several hundred yards to several miles. As the technology of electric relay logic was developed, it no longer became necessary for signalmen to <b>operate</b> <b>control</b> devices with any sort of mechanical logic at all. With the jump to all electronic logic, physical presence was no longer needed and the individual control points could be consolidated to increase system efficiency.|$|R

40|$|An {{electronic}} {{position sensor}} {{for use with}} a <b>power</b> <b>operated</b> vehicle accessory, such as a power liftgate. The position sensor includes an elongated resistive circuit that is mounted such that it is stationary and extends along {{the path of a}} track portion of the <b>power</b> <b>operated</b> accessory. The position sensor further includes a contact nub mounted to a link member that moves within the track portion such that the contact nub is slidingly biased against the elongated circuit. As the link member moves under the force of a motor-driven output gear, the contact nub slides along the surface of the resistive circuit, thereby affecting the overall resistance of the circuit. The position sensor uses the overall resistance to provide an electronic position signal to an ECU, wherein the signal is indicative of the absolute position of the <b>power</b> <b>operated</b> accessory. Accordingly, the electronic position sensor is capable of providing an electronic signal that enables the ECU to track the absolute position of the <b>power</b> <b>operated</b> accessory...|$|R
