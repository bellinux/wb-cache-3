5|$|Nadanian {{was born}} on 19 September 1972 in Baku, Azerbaijan SSR, which then {{was part of the}} Soviet Union, to Sergei and Irina, both hairdressers. He was taught to <b>play</b> <b>chess</b> by his father when he was seven. His early coach was Rafael Sarkisov, who took him on as a pupil at Spartak in Baku. In his article The Voiceless Old Man Nadanian recollects, that when he was nine or ten there were almost no chess tournaments in which young players could play with seniors and {{therefore}} he often went to the park near his house to <b>play</b> <b>chess</b> with older chess lovers. He remembers that in one of these park-battles he played against a mysterious, silent stranger {{who turned out to be}} the highly respected chess champion Vladimir Makogonov. In 1986 and 1987 Nadanian won the under-sixteen Azerbaijani championship. With the beginning of the Nagorno-Karabakh War in 1988, his family was forced to leave Baku and flee to Armenia.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} mathematical challenges of chess is the development of algorithms that can <b>play</b> <b>chess.</b> The idea of creating a chess-playing machine dates to the 18thcentury; around 1769, the chess-playing automaton called The Turk became famous before being exposed as a hoax. Serious trials based on automata, such as El Ajedrecista, were too complex and limited to be useful.|$|E

Third class children played in the common room or explored the ship—nine-year-old Frank Goldsmith recalled peering into the engine room and climbing up the baggage cranes on the poop deck.|$|E

Carlsen's goal is to use Play Magnus as a platform to encourage more people to <b>play</b> <b>chess.</b>|$|E
5|$|Steinitz {{was born}} on May 17, 1836, in the Jewish ghetto of Prague (now capital of the Czech Republic; then in Bohemia, {{a part of the}} Austrian Empire). The {{youngest}} of a tailor's thirteen sons to survive, he learned to <b>play</b> <b>chess</b> at age 12. He began playing serious chess in his twenties, after leaving Prague in 1857 to study mathematics in Vienna, at the Vienna Polytechnic. Steinitz spent two years at the university.|$|E
5|$|Writings {{about the}} theory of how to <b>play</b> <b>chess</b> {{began to appear in}} the 15thcentury. The Repetición de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez (Repetition of Love and the Art of Playing Chess) by Spanish churchman Luis Ramirez de Lucena was {{published}} in Salamanca in 1497. Lucena and later masters like Portuguese Pedro Damiano, Italians Giovanni Leonardo Di Bona, Giulio Cesare Polerio and Gioachino Greco, and Spanish bishop Ruy López de Segura developed elements of openings and started to analyze simple endgames.|$|E

5|$|Emanuel Lasker {{was born}} on December 24, 1868 at Berlinchen in Neumark (now Barlinek in Poland), {{the son of a}} Jewish cantor. At the age of eleven he was sent to Berlin to study mathematics, where he lived with his brother Berthold, eight years his senior, who taught him how to <b>play</b> <b>chess.</b> According to the website Chessmetrics, Berthold was among the world's top ten players in the early 1890s. To {{supplement}} their income Emanuel Lasker played chess and card games for small stakes, especially at the CaféKaiserhof.|$|E
5|$|He {{had also}} {{continued}} to <b>play</b> <b>chess,</b> {{competing in the}} 1952 and 1956 Olympiads. This 1956 Olympiad trip to Moscow was risky, since Britain and the USSR, which had been allies during World War II, were by then locked into the Cold War, and Milner-Barry's wartime codebreaking knowledge would have been {{of great interest to}} the Soviets; the very fact that Britain had broken German codes on a massive scale was kept secret until 1974, when Frederick Winterbotham's book The Ultra Secret was published. He placed second in the British Chess Championship at Hastings 1953 (finishing behind only Daniel Yanofsky), with a score of 8/11; this would be his best result in British Championships.|$|E
5|$|In August 2016, the Baku Chess Olympiad Operating Committee branded two {{double-decker}} buses of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism {{to operate in}} the city in the run-up and during the Olympiad. They were officially launched in late August with a ceremony during which members of the Azerbaijani national team were playing chess inside. The buses operated free of charge and took passengers to Baku's main sights. The passengers have the chance to <b>play</b> <b>chess</b> inside the buses and obtain information about the Olympiad. The buses ended operating on 14 September.|$|E

The family spent one year in Espoo, Finland, and then in Brussels, Belgium, before returning to Norway in 1998, where they lived in Lommedalen, Bærum. They later moved to Haslum. Carlsen showed an aptitude for intellectual challenges at a young age: at two years, he could solve 50-piece jigsaw puzzles; at four, he enjoyed assembling Lego sets with instructions intended for children aged 10–14. His father taught him to <b>play</b> <b>chess</b> {{at the age of}} 5, although he initially showed little interest in the game. He has three sisters, and in 2010 he stated {{that one of the things}} that first motivated him to take up chess seriously was the desire to beat his elder sister at the game.|$|E
