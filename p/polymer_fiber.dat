5000|$|... 4. <b>Polymer</b> <b>fiber</b> Bragg {{gratings}} - Prior to {{the commencement}} of PHOSFOS, gratings in polymer optical fibre (POF) only existed in the 1550 nm spectral region where the large fibre loss (1 dB/cm) only permitted very short (<10 cm) fibre lengths to be used and the devices had to be butt-coupled to a silica fiber pigtail on the optical bench. The PHOSFOS consortium has developed a means for reliably splicing POF to silica fibre and produced the first gratings in the 800 nm spectral region where losses are almost 2 orders of magnitude less than at 1550 nm. These developments have allowed POF grating sensors to be used outside the laboratory for the first time.|$|E
