50|$|<b>Permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> {{generators}} (PMGs) or alternators (PMAs) do {{not require}} a DC supply for the excitation circuit, nor do they have slip rings and contact brushes. A key disadvantage in PMAs or PMGs is that the air gap flux is not controllable, so the voltage of the machine cannot be easily regulated. A persistent magnetic field imposes safety issues during assembly, field service or repair. High performance <b>permanent</b> <b>magnets,</b> themselves, have structural and thermal issues. Torque current MMF vectorially combines with the persistent flux of <b>permanent</b> <b>magnets,</b> which leads to higher air-gap flux density and eventually, core saturation. In this <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> <b>alternators</b> the speed is directly proportional to the output voltage of the alternator.|$|R
50|$|With the {{availability}} of modern power electronics it is often easier to operate the generator at an arbitrary frequency and feed its output through an inverter which produces output at grid frequency. Power electronics now allow the use of <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> <b>alternators</b> that produce wild AC to be stabilised. This approach allows low speed / low head water turbines to be competitive; they can run at the best speed for extraction of energy, and the power frequency {{is controlled by the}} electronics instead of the generator.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{electronic}} power conversion system and control for an advanced mobile generator set is described. The military generator set uses an internal combustion diesel engine to drive a radial-gap <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> <b>alternator</b> at variable speed. The speed of the engine is determined from a user selectable interface that for a given load and ambient thermal conditions controls the engine to run at its most efficient operating point. It is also possible to control the engine to run where it is most audibly quiet, at its least-polluting operating point, or at its most reliable, stiffest point such that it is less sensitive to load transients. The variable frequency, variable voltage produced by the <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> <b>alternator</b> is diode-rectified to dc voltage, and an inverter is used to produce selectable frequency, controllable ac voltage. The power conversion system also incorporates a bi-directional dc-dc converter that can charge 24 V batteries {{that are used to}} start the IC engine and to power auxiliary loads. The bi-directional converter can also draw power from the batteries to help maintain the dc link during severe load transients. The design of this new generator set offers additional flexibility by being lighter, smaller, and more fuel efficient than a conventional fixed-speed gen-set. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract A {{proof-of-concept}} military advanced {{mobile generator}} set has been developed. The military generator set uses an internal combustion diesel engine {{to drive a}} radial-gap <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> <b>alternator</b> at variable speed. The speed of the engine is determined from a user selectable interface that for a given load and ambient thermal conditions controls the engine to run at its most efficient operating point. The variable frequency, variable voltage produced by the <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> <b>alternator</b> is diode-rectified to a high voltage (~ 400 V) dc link, and an inverter is used to produce selectable frequency, controllable ac voltage. As part of the power electronics for this unit, a 7 kW bi-directional dc-dc converter has also been developed. The converter can charge 24 V batteries {{that are used to}} start the internal combustion engine and to power auxiliary low voltage dc loads. Additionally, the bi-directional converter can also draw power from the batteries to help maintain the high voltage dc link during severe load transients. Because of stringent weight and volume requirements for this application, the minimum in energy storage elements (high frequency transformers, capacitors, and inductors) was used.

50|$|Efficiency of {{automotive}} alternators {{is limited by}} fan cooling loss, bearing loss, iron loss, copper loss, and the voltage drop in the diode bridges. Efficiency reduces dramatically at high speeds mainly due to fan resistance. At medium speeds efficiency of today's alternators is 70-80%. This betters very small high-performance <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> <b>alternators,</b> such as those used for bicycle lighting systems, which achieve an efficiency around 60%. Larger <b>permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> electric machines (that can operate as motors or alternators) can achieve today much higher efficiencies. Pellegrino et al., for instance, propose not particularly expensive designs that show ample regions in which efficiency is above 96%. Large AC generators used in power stations run at carefully controlled speeds and have no constraints on size or weight. They have very high efficiencies as high as 98%.|$|R

Presented at the 4 th Annual Capitol Graduate Research Summit, Topeka, KS, 2007 A modified tractor alternator is designed and constructed to suit a 300 Watt low speed, high altitude wind turbine. The tractor alternator {{does not produce}} the required power output for the given speed of the turbine.
