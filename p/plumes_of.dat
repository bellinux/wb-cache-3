5|$|The school {{operates}} the F.G. Walton Smith research vessel. Designed to met the school's specifications, the catamaran {{was put on}} water in 2000. It {{is equipped with a}} special sea water flow system that can take samples. The on-board lab can perform chemical analysis of those water samples. It also has transducers for measuring ocean currents, sub-bottom profiling, and deep water bathymetry. In response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the vessel was reassigned to environmental monitoring of affected areas and to track underwater <b>plumes</b> <b>of</b> oil.|$|E
5|$|The tidal {{forces are}} about 1,000 times {{stronger}} than the Moon's effect on Earth. The only other moon in the Solar System exhibiting water vapor plumes is Enceladus. The estimated eruption rate at Europa is about 7000kg/s compared to about 200kg/s for the <b>plumes</b> <b>of</b> Enceladus. If confirmed, it would open {{the possibility of a}} flyby through the plume and obtain a sample to analyze in situ without having to use a lander and drill through miles of ice.|$|E
5|$|Not {{included}} in the official number of fatalities were deaths that were recorded as pneumonia. Workers alleged that this diagnosis was a cover for death from carbon monoxide poisoning (brought on {{by the use of}} gasoline-fueled vehicles in the diversion tunnels), and a classification used by Six Companies to avoid paying compensation claims. The site's diversion tunnels frequently reached , enveloped in thick <b>plumes</b> <b>of</b> vehicle exhaust gases. A total of 42workers were recorded as having died from pneumonia; none were listed as having died from carbon monoxide poisoning. No deaths of non-workers from pneumonia were recorded in Boulder City during the construction period.|$|E

5|$|Despite its feathers, most palaeontologists do not {{consider}} Sinosauropteryx to be birds. Phylogenetically, the genus is only distantly related to the clade Aves, usually defined as Archaeopteryx lithographica plus modern birds. The scientists who described Sinosauropteryx, however, used a character-based, or apomorphic, definition of the Class Aves, in which any animal with feathers {{is considered to be}} a bird. They argued that the filamentous <b>plumes</b> <b>of</b> Sinosauropteryx represent true feathers with a rachis and barbs, and thus that Sinosauropteryx should be considered a true bird. They classified the genus as belonging to a new biological order, Sinosauropterygiformes, family Sinosauropterygidae, within the subclass Sauriurae. These proposals have not been accepted, and Sinosauropteryx is generally classified in the family Compsognathidae, a group of small-bodied long-tailed coelurosaurian theropods known from the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous of Asia, Europe, and South America.|$|E
5|$|Ecological {{damage was}} {{widespread}} but generally mild. Although damage to mangroves was minor, the cyclone defoliated swaths of many coastal and island forests. For the most part, cays and reefs were unharmed, with no visible {{change in the}} general appearance or shape of reefs and little underwater change as well. It was noted, however, that water clarity surrounding certain reefs was poor. River <b>plumes</b> <b>of</b> the Herbert, Tully, Murray, Hull, Johnstone, and Mulgrave/Russell rivers were noticeably changed, with some paths diverted. The Herbert River plume expanded to encompass areas near the Greater Palm group of islands, the Mulgrave/Russell around the Frankland Islands. In addition, {{the loss of a}} raft system utilized for farming of giant clams was noted near Fitzroy Island. Tourist operations experienced little damage from Winifred, with only minimal damage on Dunk Island, Bedarra Island, and Mission Beach. Overall, Winifred caused three deaths and $130million (1986AUD) in damage, and was described by the Bureau of Meteorology as the worst cyclone to strike Queensland since Cyclone Althea in 1971.|$|E
5|$|The script {{called for}} the probe to {{vaporize}} the Earth's oceans, generating heavy cloud cover. While effects cinematographer Don Dow {{wanted to go to}} sea and record <b>plumes</b> <b>of</b> water created by exploding detonating cords in the water, the team decided to create the probe's climatic effect in another way after a government fishing agency voiced concerns for the welfare of marine life in the area. The team used a combination of baking soda and cloud tank effects; the swirling mist created by the water-filled tank was shot on black velvet, and color and dynamic swirls were added by injecting paint into the tank. These shots were composited onto a painting of the Earth along with overlaid lightning effects, created by double-exposing lights as they moved across the screen.|$|E

25|$|Gulls {{have only}} a limited ability to dive below the water to feed on deeper prey. To obtain prey from deeper down, many species of gulls feed in {{association}} with other animals, where marine hunters drive prey to the surface when hunting. Examples of such associations include four species of gulls feeding around <b>plumes</b> <b>of</b> mud brought to the surface by feeding grey whales, and also between orcas (largest dolphin species) and kelp gulls (and other seabirds).|$|E
25|$|Vog (volcanic fog) can envelop the island.

Vog contains chemicals that can damage the environment and the health of plants, humans, and other animals. Most of the aerosols are acidic and of a size where they can remain in the lungs to damage them and impair function. Flu-like symptoms and general lethargy are reported, especially pronounced in people with respiratory conditions.|$|E
25|$|Femme à l'Éventail is an oil {{painting}} on canvas with dimensions 90.7 x 64.2cm (35.75 x 25.25 in). As the title indicates, the painting represents a woman holding a fan.

She is wearing an elaborate gown with a Polka dot pattern consisting of an array of blue-filled circles, and holds in her right hand a folded fan. The left hand of the woman holds a paper that bares the artists signature (lower left). She wears a hat with feathers or <b>plumes</b> <b>of</b> fashionable dressed Parisian women. She is placed in an outdoor setting with buildings, windows and green shutters in the 'background'. The work is similar stylistically with another work exhibited at the same Salon d'Automne, Dancer in a café (Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo New York).|$|E

500|$|Males of many species, {{ranging from}} the widely {{introduced}} ring-necked pheasant to Africa's many whydahs, have one or more elongated pairs of rectrices, which play an often-critical role in their courtship rituals. [...] The outermost pair of rectrices in male lyrebirds are extremely long and strongly curved at the ends. [...] These plumes are raised up over the bird's head (along with a fine spray of modified uppertail coverts) during his extraordinary display. [...] Rectrix modification reaches its pinnacle among the birds of paradise, which display an assortment of often bizarrely modified feathers, {{ranging from the}} extremely long <b>plumes</b> <b>of</b> the ribbon-tailed astrapia (nearly three times {{the length of the}} bird itself) to the dramatically coiled twin <b>plumes</b> <b>of</b> the magnificent bird-of-paradise.|$|E
500|$|Scientists {{have long}} speculated that {{conditions}} on Titan {{resemble those of}} early Earth, though {{at a much lower}} temperature.

Global maps of the lake distribution on Titan's surface revealed that there is not enough surface methane to account for its continued presence in its atmosphere, and thus that a significant portion must be added through volcanic processes.|$|E
500|$|Similar {{activity}} {{continued at}} the volcano {{over the following}} weeks, excavating the crater, forming an adjacent caldera, and erupting small amounts of steam, ash, and tephra.

500|$|Geyser-like <b>plumes</b> <b>of</b> water vapour, {{together}} with ice particles and smaller amounts of other components (such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, ammonia, hydrocarbons and silicates), {{have been observed}} erupting from vents associated with the [...] "tiger stripes" [...] in the south polar region of Saturn's moon Enceladus by the Cassini orbiter. The mechanism by which the plumes are generated remains uncertain, but they {{are believed to be}} powered at least in part by tidal heating resulting from orbital eccentricity due to a 2:1 mean-motion orbital resonance with the moon Dione. These jets are believed to be the source of Saturn's E Ring.|$|E
500|$|The {{squadron}} also inherited its {{secondary role}} of air sampling from No. 543 Squadron. This involved flying through <b>plumes</b> <b>of</b> airborne contamination and using onboard equipment to collect fallout released from both above ground and underground nuclear tests for later analysis at the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston. Five aircraft had small pylons fitted to the redundant Skybolt hardpoints, {{which could be}} used to carry sampling pods modified from drop tanks. These pods would collect the needed samples on a filter, while an additional smaller [...] "localiser" [...] pod was fitted to the port wing, inboard of the main pylons.|$|E
