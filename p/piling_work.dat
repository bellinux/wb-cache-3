500|$|Called [...] "Jordan Bridge 21" [...] by British Waterways, {{this bridge}} carried a railway that linked Blackburn Meadows Sewage Works to {{additional}} filters and contact beds {{to the east}} of the navigation. It was constructed by Logan and Hemmingway, who won a contract valued at £41,046 in April 1907, which included six settling tanks, 24 contact beds, and the bridge. The eastern approach consists of three brick arches, which allowed a siding to pass through it. Continued expansion of the works required a second bridge to be constructed in 1922, to carry the railway over the river channel. The steelwork for Holmes bridge was supplied by Charles Ross Ltd, who were based in Sheffield, while <b>piling</b> <b>work</b> was carried out by Yorkshire Hennebique Concreting Co Ltd.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to study and prepare basic time for <b>piling</b> <b>works</b> by synthetic equations. The time data of 7 <b>work</b> elements of <b>piling</b> <b>works</b> were collected from 10 different construction sites in Phuket Province of Thailand. The synthetic equations were derived with multiple regressions analysis method using statistic software package. These work elements consisted of <b>pile</b> driving <b>work,</b> moving <b>piling</b> rig left or right on supporting rails, moving supporting rails left or right, moving piling rig and supporting rails back or forth, joining of two-piece pile by welding, joining of two-piece pile by steel coupling, and pile driving with pushing post. These synthetic equations were used to determine the basic time, standard time, and productivity values for various types and sizes of square precast concrete pile. The researchers found that these productivity values were reliable compared to general practice, and could be applied in construction planning and scheduling in Phuket province or other area with similar geological conditions...|$|R

On 18 February 2017, MMRDA officials stated that 15% of piling, pile caps and pier work on the corridor had been completed. By the end of April, 25% of <b>piling</b> <b>work,</b> 60% of barricading work and 77% of the soil testing for pier foundation had been completed.|$|E
50|$|The methods most used to {{mitigate}} {{the problem of the}} ground-structure interaction consist of the employment of the before-seen isolation systems and of some ground brace techniques, which are adopted above all on the low-quality ones (categories D and E).The most diffused techniques are the jet-grouting technique and the <b>pile</b> <b>work</b> technique.The jet-grouting technique consists of injecting in the subsoil some liquid concrete by means of a drill. When this concrete hardens it forms a sort of column that consolidates the surrounding soil. This process is repeated on all areas of the structure.The <b>pile</b> <b>work</b> technique consists of using piles, which, once inserted in the ground, support the foundation and the building above, by moving the loads or the weights towards soil layers that are deeper and therefore more compact and movement-resistant.|$|R
50|$|Groundwork {{began with}} {{boreholes}} in spring 2007; throughout {{the late summer}} of 2007 the site was cleared. In September 2007 work commenced to excavate and remove the existing foundations and basement of the previous Royal Mail building. Substructure work began in early 2008, with the <b>piling</b> <b>works</b> by Cementation Skanska completed by June 2008.|$|R
50|$|The {{existence}} of the school itself has also been threatened. The primary school was evacuated to the compound of SK Raja Perempuan in January 1994 when <b>piling</b> <b>works</b> for construction of the Ipoh Parade next door caused cracks {{to appear in the}} school building. The secondary school, however, stayed put and braved the storm.|$|R
5000|$|By 1909 another {{addition}} was needed. The 66 x 120 ft four storey over stone basement, costing about $80,000, {{was designed}} by J.A. Senecal and J.A. Hudon and built by Senecal and Smith. The annex was 18 ft wider than the original building. This change in width was hidden on the Academy Road side by a large tower housing a staircase. The fourth floor was {{an extension of the}} dormitories. The south side of the first floor housed the music department with 25 pianos. A substantial amount of <b>piling</b> <b>work</b> was undertaken during the 1930s to address cracking foundations and other damage.|$|E
50|$|Narborough {{watermill}} {{is thought}} to have been built around 1780 and over the years has been extended, altered and had parts demolished over the long period of its existence. In 1845 the watermill had an extension built on to the North West corner of the mill by the miller Charles Tyssen. However this addition proved to be un-successful as the building had been erected on poor foundations and it began to slowly sink over a period of years. The section, including a miller’s house which stood to the front, had to be demolished in 1980 for safety reasons. At the same time <b>piling</b> <b>work</b> was done to underpin the remaining building.|$|E
5000|$|Work {{began in}} March 2013. However, in November 2013 the {{existing}} wooden bridge {{was found to}} have been affected by the <b>piling</b> <b>work</b> for the new bridge.

This necessitated an 8-mile diversion via Maentwrog for road users and rail services were terminated at , closing the 22 mi line to [...] via [...] A new temporary road bridge was due to be in place by Spring 2014, but this plan was shelved by Gwynedd County Council in favour of a controlled traffic management system on the A496 between Maentwrog and Llandecwyn because of safety fears due to increased traffic on the A496.|$|E

50|$|Only after a law {{was passed}} in 1917 {{covering}} relocation of the shunting yard and the goods station to Mølleengen near the Aarhus River were the plans put into practice. In 1919, a new city plan was adopted and in 1920 work on the new goods station in Skovgaardsgade was able to start. Owing to difficult soil conditions, extensive <b>piling</b> <b>work</b> had to be carried out, including 1,150,000 m3 of landfill which was moved by hand. In addition, {{a portion of the}} river was moved further north, and 3,000 fir trunks were pounded in to a depth of 20 meters as foundations for the facility's new buildings. The engineer responsible for the foundation work was track manager Thorvald Engqvist.|$|E
