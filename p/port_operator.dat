40|$|The {{container}} handling rates at ports are input for container shipping operations planning by shipping lines. The handling rates are unilaterally determined by <b>port</b> <b>operators.</b> This article {{points out that}} it may be possible for <b>port</b> <b>operators</b> to provide higher handling rates at some additional costs. The higher handling rates will enable ships to have more time sailing at sea, leading to less fuel consumption. The reduction in fuel costs for shipping lines may be more significant than the additional costs incurred by <b>port</b> <b>operators.</b> We therefore propose a practical and easy-to-implement collaborative mechanism between shipping lines and <b>port</b> <b>operators,</b> where the shipping lines compensate the <b>port</b> <b>operators</b> for their additional costs. As a result, the overall efficiency of container transportation is improved. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|R

40|$|Ports {{facilitate}} a waterborne transport {{which is the}} backbone of international trade, and thereby the global economy. This vital position in the international trade coupled with their nature as a limited capacity infrastructure enabled ports {{to be a significant}} market actor that is susceptible to possess market power. <b>Port</b> <b>operators</b> may acquire a dominant position in the relevant markets concerned. The acquisition of a dominant position may not be a concern in itself. However, this dominant position may contain an inherent element of potential capacity of abusive behavior which may compromise effective competition in the port industry. Despite its obvious importance to the economy, the application of competition rules to <b>port</b> <b>operators</b> has always been complicated due to various factors. Considering the high significance of ports in facilitating the international trade of EU and the free movement of persons and goods within the Union, this study focuses on determining the extent of application of the EU competition rules for the sector of <b>port</b> <b>operators.</b> Under this general purpose, this thesis will analyze the rule prohibiting abuse of dominant position in port operators; in particular, examining the core points of this rule such as ‘undertakings’, ‘relevant market’, ‘dominance’ and ‘abuse’; and finally, determining how and to what extent the rule against an abuse of dominant position could be applicable to <b>port</b> <b>operators...</b>|$|R
