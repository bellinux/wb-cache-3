Generally, the lower density woods will produce boards with strength properties superior to the higher density species [4]. A study by Setunge et al.

30|$|Relationship {{between the}} IB {{strength}} and <b>pressing</b> <b>time</b> {{is shown in}} Fig.  5. The IB strength of the boards increased greatly with increasing of <b>pressing</b> <b>time</b> from 2 to 10  min and then decreased slightly at 15  min. The IB value of the board with 2  min <b>pressing</b> <b>time</b> was extremely lower value. Based on the temperature of each layer of the board during hot pressing, as shown in Fig.  6, the increasing temperature in the core layer of particleboard was slower than that in the surface layers. The temperature at core layer for 2  min pressing reached less than target temperature of 200 [*]°C, i.e., around 150 [*]°C; hence, the citric acid did not react properly at core layer. Consequently, the adhesiveness at core layer was poorly. However, the temperature at core layer for <b>pressing</b> <b>time</b> more than 5  min was closed to the target temperature and reached about 200 [*]°C at 10  min. Because of that, the IB strength of the board increased significantly from 2 to 5  min and then increased gradually until 10  min. It means that the <b>pressing</b> <b>time</b> of 10  min was needed to obtain good adhesiveness in all layer of particleboard. Furthermore, excluding the board manufactured for 2  min, all the boards had higher IB strength than the type 18 requirement of JIS A 5908 [19].|$|E
