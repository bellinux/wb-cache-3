25|$|The TBM 900 model {{features}} several ergonomic improvements within the cockpit, increasing both simplicity and automation. A new single power lever integrates the power, propeller and condition lever controls. Various switches and controls, such as some formerly present upon the overhead panel, have been eliminated. The electrical system {{is powered by}} a single main generator, which is supplemented by a belt-driven alternator. On the TBM 900, electrical load distribution changes enable the Garmin G1000 glass cockpit to power up in sync with the switch-on of the battery with little battery drain. The G1000 also has upgraded displays, including an ISA temperature deviation indication, integrated weather radar and MFD map, and automatic landing field elevation inputs to the <b>pressurization</b> <b>controller.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Encore's {{standard}} equipment list have been increased and many {{systems have been}} upgraded. Bleed air is used to anti-ice the wing leading edge, and several boundary layer energizers, plus a stall fence, {{have been added to}} the wing to improve stall characteristics. A digital <b>pressurization</b> <b>controller</b> reduces pilot workload and an improved wheel brake system offers better modulation. Redesigned interior fittings and passenger seats provide more seated headroom. New passenger service units provide more even airflow and temperature control.The Encore's MTOW is bumped 330 pounds to 16,630 pounds, enabling it to carry five passengers with full fuel. The additional weight increases takeoff field length to 3,561 feet, compared with 3,180 feet for the Ultra. The much improved high altitude thrust output of the PW535 engines, however, allow the Encore to climb faster and cruise higher. Its maximum cruise altitude is FL 450.|$|E
40|$|The highest {{time-averaged}} indoor radon concentrations for a slab-on-grade structure {{occur when}} the structure experience neutral pressure conditions. Experimental evidence was provided throughout the utilization of the University of Florida Radon Research House (UFRRH) showing that semi-diurnal atmospheric pressure variations are responsible for continuous pumping of radon-rich soil gas into the structure which elevates indoor radon concentrations. A pressure sensitive HVAC controller system was designed to minimize the indoor radon concentrations. The HVAC Unbalanced <b>Pressurization</b> <b>Controller</b> (HUPC) system accommodates for the semidiurnal pumping of radon and the transient changes in barometric pressure. The system is capable of initiating HVAC unit ventilation during the OFT thermostat position of the HVAC operating cycle. The system is designed to operate with two basic features: performing variable-in-time triggering functions and creating controlled HVAC positive ventilation. This HUCP concept may utilize to reduce indoor Rn concentrations from 2000 Bq m' 3 to less than 120 Bq m" 3 that have observed with continuous fan ventilation at the UFRRH. Two HUPC system designs were developed including one with a simple mechanical system alteration to the HVAC duct system...|$|E
50|$|A pitot-static {{system is}} a system of {{pressure-sensitive}} instruments that is most often used in aviation to determine an aircraft's airspeed, Mach number, altitude, and altitude trend. A pitot-static system generally consists of a pitot tube, a static port, and the pitot-static instruments. Other instruments that might be connected are air data computers, flight data recorders, altitude encoders, cabin <b>pressurization</b> <b>controllers,</b> and various airspeed switches. Errors in pitot-static system readings can be extremely dangerous as the information obtained from the pitot static system, such as altitude, is potentially safety-critical. Several commercial airline disasters have been traced to {{a failure of the}} pitot-static system.|$|R
