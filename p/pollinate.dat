5|$|Pollen wasps in the {{subfamily}} Masarinae gather nectar and pollen in a crop {{inside their}} bodies, {{rather than on}} body hairs like bees, and <b>pollinate</b> flowers of Penstemon and the water leaf family, Hydrophyllaceae.|$|E
5|$|Beetle-pollinated {{flowers are}} usually large, greenish or off-white in color, and heavily scented. Scents may be spicy, fruity, or similar to {{decaying}} organic material. Beetles {{were most likely}} the first insects to <b>pollinate</b> flowers. Most beetle-pollinated flowers are flattened or dish-shaped, with pollen easily accessible, although they may include traps to keep the beetle longer. The plants' ovaries are usually well protected from the biting mouthparts of their pollinators. The beetle families that habitually <b>pollinate</b> flowers are the Buprestidae, Cantharidae, Carambycidae, Cleridae, Dermestidae, Lycidae, Melyridae, Mordellidae, Nitidulidae and Scarabeidae. Beetles may be particularly important {{in some parts of}} the world such as semiarid areas of southern Africa and southern California and the montane grasslands of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa.|$|E
5000|$|Ficus septica is <b>pollinated</b> by fig wasps {{from the}} genus Ceratosolen. Usually {{members of the}} genus Ficus are <b>pollinated</b> by a single species of <b>pollinating</b> fig wasps {{specific}} to each fig species, but recent observations of Ficus septica have shown there to be three <b>pollinating</b> species in the South of Taiwan [...] and two in The Philippines.|$|R
50|$|Most {{species of}} Eremophila are insect <b>pollinated</b> - E.decipiens {{is one of}} the 40 or so that are <b>pollinated</b> by birds.|$|R
50|$|Iris brevicaulis is {{primarily}} <b>pollinated</b> by bumblebees. But {{it is also}} occasionally <b>pollinated</b> by hummingbirds.They are <b>pollinated</b> in different ways, the hummingbirds must use their head to push back the iris' petals {{in order to gain}} access to the nectar. Pollen is then transferred on a hummingbird's forehead.|$|R
5|$|Bumblebees are {{important}} pollinators of both crops and wildflowers. Because bumblebees do not overwinter the entire colony, {{they do not}} stockpile honey, and therefore are not useful as honey producers. Bumblebees are increasingly cultured for agricultural use as pollinators, among other reasons because they can <b>pollinate</b> plants such as tomato in greenhouses by buzz pollination whereas other pollinators cannot. Commercial production began in 1987, when Roland De Jonghe founded the Biobest company; in 1988 they produced enough nests to <b>pollinate</b> 40 hectares of tomatoes. The industry grew quickly, starting with other companies in the Netherlands. Bumblebee nests, mainly of buff-tailed bumblebees, are produced in at least 30 factories around the world; over a million nests are grown annually in Europe; Turkey is a major producer.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have kept}} honey bee colonies, {{commonly}} in hives, for millennia. Beekeepers collect honey, beeswax, propolis, pollen, and royal jelly from hives; bees are also kept to <b>pollinate</b> crops and to produce bees {{for sale to}} other beekeepers.|$|E
5|$|In this way, {{the bucket}} orchid passes its pollen from flower to flower. This {{mechanism}} is almost {{but not quite}} species specific, as {{it is possible for}} a few closely related bees to <b>pollinate</b> any given species of orchid, as long as the bees are similar in size and are attracted by the same compounds.|$|E

40|$|A field {{experiment}} was conducted during summer 1995 on honeybee pollination at Bangalore using CMS 234 A and 234 B (female parent and maintainer) parents of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). Observations revealed {{that all the}} 5 species of honeybees, viz Apis dorsata, Apis mellifera, Apis cerana, Apis florea and Trigona irridipennis participated in foraging in sunflower throughout the day. Two peak foraging periods were encountered in all the species. The filled seed weight, grain filling () and oil content were considerably increased in the plots <b>pollinated</b> only by the honeybees. The seed weight was maximum (25. 04 g/head) in honeybee <b>pollinated</b> plot followed by hand and bees <b>pollinated</b> (24. 78 g/head); pollination by other pollinators (13. 59 g/head) and exclusively hand <b>pollinated</b> (12. 98 g/head) plots in case of female parent. However, it was recorded lowest (5. 16 g/head) in check plots without hand or bees pollination. The grain filling () (92. 95) and oil content () (53. 10) were also maximum m the plots <b>pollinated</b> with bees. In case of maintainer (234 B), the seed weight was maximum (14. 49 g/head) in the plots <b>pollinated</b> by bees and other pollinators followed by exclusively hand <b>pollinated</b> (12. 66 g/head) and check plot without hand or bees pollination (9. 75 g/head).

5|$|Herbivores eat plants, but {{plants can}} defend {{themselves}} and some species are parasitic or even carnivorous. Other organisms form mutually beneficial relationships with plants. For example, mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia provide plants with nutrients {{in exchange for}} food, ants are recruited by ant plants to provide protection, honey bees, bats and other animals <b>pollinate</b> flowers and humans and other animals act as dispersal vectors to spread spores and seeds.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia nigrocincta, {{commonly}} known as the jumper ant or jumping jack, is an ant of the genus Myrmecia. The species was first described by Frederick Smith in 1858. Colonies of this ant are abundant in eastern Australia. Ants of this species are known for their ability to jump several inches, and they also have a powerful, venomous sting. Rather than foraging on the ground, M. nigrocincta prefer to forage in trees where they are known to <b>pollinate</b> certain flowers.|$|E
5|$|P. imperialis {{crossed the}} waters between Australia and New Zealand some time between 1960 and 1972, and {{seedlings}} {{of the previously}} infertile trees of F. rubiginosa began appearing in brick and stone walls, and on other trees, particularly in parks and gardens around Auckland. They have been recorded {{as far south as}} Napier. P. imperialis has been transported to Hawaii, California and Israel, where it has been observed to <b>pollinate</b> its host.|$|E
40|$|Cypripedioideae (five genera; ca. 176 species) are {{widespread}} in temperate and tropical Asia and America. About a quarter (42) {{of the species}} have been studied to determine their pollinators and/or breeding systems. All flowers are one-way traps <b>pollinated</b> by insects of particular types and size. Slipper orchids are selfcompatible and <b>pollinated</b> by deceit. Most Cypripedium species are <b>pollinated</b> by bees, whereas some smallerflowered species are <b>pollinated</b> by flies, and a few are <b>pollinated</b> by both. Most bee-pollinated Cypripedium species appear to be generalized food mimics. The fly-pollinated species have evolved diverse pollination systems that utilize a variety of flies as pollen vectors, including fruit flies, dung flies, and a fungal spore-eating hoverfly (Syrphidae). Most species of the tropical Asian Paphiopedilum and tropical American Phragmipedium are <b>pollinated</b> by hoverflies; flowers of many species in both genera have aphid-like spots that attract gravid female hoverflies that normally lay their eggs in aphid colonies. The more brightly colored Paphiopedilum micranthum and Phragmipedium besseae are <b>pollinated</b> by Hymenoptera. Autogamy is limited but occurs most frequently in Phragmipedium species. About two-thirds of the insect-pollinated slipper orchids (25 / 37) have evolved highly specialized flowers that are <b>pollinated</b> by a single pollinator or several pollinator species in the same genus. Species belonging to the same taxonomic section usually have the same pollination system.

5|$|Researchers are {{concerned}} that trucking colonies {{around the country to}} <b>pollinate</b> crops, where they intermingle with other bees from all over, helps spread viruses and mites among colonies. Additionally, such continuous movement and re-settlement is considered by some a strain and disruption for the entire hive, possibly rendering it less resistant to all sorts of systemic disorder.|$|E
5|$|Some flower-feeding thrips <b>pollinate</b> {{the flowers}} they are feeding on, and some authors suspect {{that they may}} have been among the first insects to evolve a pollinating {{relationship}} with their host plants. Scirtothrips dorsalis carries pollen of commercially important chili peppers. Darwin found that thrips could not be kept out by any netting when he conducted experiments by keeping away larger pollinators.|$|E
5|$|The Liliaceae are ecologically diverse. Species of Liliaceae bloom {{at various}} times from spring to late summer.

5|$|Bumblebees are Northern Hemisphere animals. When {{red clover}} was {{introduced}} as a crop to New Zealand {{in the nineteenth}} century, it {{was found to have}} no local pollinators, and clover seed had accordingly to be imported each year. Four species of bumblebee from the United Kingdom were therefore imported as pollinators. In 1885 and 1886 the Canterbury Acclimatization Society brought in 442 queens, of which 93 survived and quickly multiplied. As planned, red clover was soon being produced from locally-grown seed. Bumblebees are also reared commercially to <b>pollinate</b> tomatoes grown in greenhouses. The New Zealand population of buff-tailed bumblebees naturally colonised Tasmania, 1,500 miles away, in 1992.|$|E
