5000|$|The {{color of}} {{pyrargyrite}} is usually greyish-black and the lustre metallic-adamantine; large crystals are opaque, but small ones and thin splinters are deep ruby-red by transmitted light, hence the name, from the Greek pyr and argyros, [...] "fire-silver" [...] in allusion to color and silver content, given by E. F. Glocker in 1831. The streak is purplish-red, thus differing markedly from the scarlet streak of <b>proustite</b> and affording a ready means of distinguishing the two minerals. The Mohs hardness is 2.75, {{and the specific}} gravity 5.85. The refractive indices (nω=3.084 nε=2.881) and birefringence (δ=0.203) are very high. There is no very distinct cleavage and the fracture is conchoidal. The mineral occurs in metalliferous veins with calcite, argentiferous galena, native silver, native arsenic, &c. The best crystallized specimens are from Sankt Andreasberg in the Harz, Freiberg in Saxony, and Guanajuato in Mexico. It is not uncommon in many silver mines in the United States, but rarely as distinct crystals; {{and it has been}} found in some Cornish mines.Although the red silver ores afford a good example of isomorphism, they rarely form mixtures; pyrargyrite rarely contains as much as 3% of arsenic replacing antimony, and {{the same is true of}} antimony in <b>proustite.</b> Dimorphous with pyrargyrite and <b>proustite</b> respectively are the rare monoclinic species pyrostilpnite or fireblende (Ag3SbS3) and xanthoconite (Ag3AsS3): these four minerals thus form an isodimorphous group.|$|E
50|$|Aguilarite is uncommon, {{and forms}} at {{relatively}} low temperatures in hydrothermal deposits rich in silver and selenium but deficient in sulfur. The mineral is known {{from a number}} of countries in North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Australasia. Aguilarite occurs in association with acanthite, calcite, naumannite, pearceite, <b>proustite,</b> silver, stephanite, and quartz.|$|E

There {{he taught}} at the Chemistry School in Segovia and at the University of Salamanca.But when Napoleon invaded Spain, they burned Proust's laboratory and forced him back to France. On July 5, 1826 he died in Angers, France. The mineral <b>proustite</b> (Ag3AsS3) is named in his honour.|$|E
5000|$|Kankite {{was first}} {{described}} in 1976 for an occurrence in the Kaňk, Kutná Hora, Bohemia, Czech Republic. [...] It {{is a rare}} secondary mineral in highly weathered mine dumps containing arsenopyrite (in the Czech Republic). It occurs in association with scorodite, pitticite, parascorodite, zykaite, arsenopyrite, vajdakite, native arsenic, pyrite, <b>proustite,</b> gypsum, “limonite” and quartz.|$|E
50|$|It {{is closely}} allied to, and {{isomorphous}} with, the corresponding sulfarsenide known as <b>proustite</b> or light red silver ore. Ruby silver or red silver ore (German Rotgiiltigerz) was mentioned by Georg Agricola in 1546, {{but the two}} species so closely resemble one another {{that they were not}} completely distinguished until chemical analyses of both were made.|$|E
50|$|<b>Proustite</b> is a sulfosalt mineral {{consisting}} of; silver sulfarsenide, Ag3AsS3, known also {{as light}} red silver or ruby silver ore, {{and an important}} source of the metal. It is closely allied to the corresponding sulfantimonide, pyrargyrite, from which it was distinguished by the chemical analyses of Joseph L. Proust (1754-1826) in 1804, after whom the mineral received its name.|$|E
50|$|Stephanite {{occurs as}} a late-stage mineral with other ores of silver in {{hydrothermal}} veins. Associated minerals include <b>proustite,</b> acanthite, native silver, tetrahedrite, galena, sphalerite and pyrite. Localities which have yielded good crystallized specimens are Freiberg and Gersdorf near Rosswein in Saxony, Chañarcillo in Chile, and exceptionally Cornwall. In the Comstock lode in Nevada massive stephanite and argentite are important ores of silver.|$|E
50|$|The primary ore {{consists}} of galena, iron rich sphalerite and tetrahedrite as ore minerals along with common accessories pyrite, pyrrhotite, quartz, carbonates and graphite. Minor arsenopyrite, marcasite, chalcopyrite, valleriite, <b>proustite,</b> polybasite and argentite also occur. Original surface oxidized ore contained cerussite, anglesite and pyromorphite. Silver and zinc {{were removed from}} the surface oxidized zone and were deposited as supergene ore at a depth above the primary ore.|$|E
50|$|The type {{locality}} is the Mollie Gibson Mine, Aspen, Aspen District (Roaring Fork District), Pitkin County, Colorado, {{where the}} mineral occurs in hydrothermal deposits formed at low to medium temperatures, associated with acanthite, tetrahedrite, native silver, <b>proustite,</b> quartz, baryte and calcite. Type material is lodged at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, references 3.4270, 3.4292, 3.4293, and at The Natural History Museum, London, England, reference 84843.|$|E
50|$|Silver was {{discovered}} at Phillipsburg in 1864, {{and the district}} {{was one of the}} most prolific silver producers in Montana. Major mines included the Granite Mountain mine, the Bi-Metallic mine, and the Hope mine. In 1887, the district produced 2.2 million troy ounces (68 metric tons) of silver, making it the largest silver producer in the US for that year. The district suffered greatly from the fall in the price of silver in 1893, and remained moribund until World War I, when the manganese deposits of the district became valuable, and Philipsburg became one of the top US producers of that metal. Silver occurs in veins filling fracture zones through Paleozoic limestone. Minerals in the silver-ore veins include polybasite, pyrargyrite, <b>proustite,</b> sphalerite, galena, and tennantite. Manganese occurs as replacement bodies of pyrolusite and rhodochrosite in limestone adjacent to the fracture zones. No mines are presently active in the district.|$|E
