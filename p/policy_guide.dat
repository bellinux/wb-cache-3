40|$|Recently, {{some analysts}} have {{prescribed}} the combined use of certain market prices {{as a useful}} strategy for monetary policy. In light of problems with conventional (time-series) empirical tests of the approach, one may consider an alternative "test" of this strategy: examining historical episodes when the strategy was employed. The Swedish experience during the early 1930 s provides one such example. This experience, fathered by Knut Wicksell, {{is an example of}} a fiat money-flexible exchange rate regime in which (i) a short-term interest rate was used as a policy instrument, (ii) market prices were used as <b>policy</b> <b>guides</b> or intermediate indicators, and (Hi) price stability was the explicitly voiced goal of monetary policy. Monetary or reserve aggregates were neither proposed nor employed as <b>policy</b> <b>guides</b> or targets in pursuing this price stabilization objective. This Swedish experience is important since it provides a rare example of a market price approach to monetary policy. This paper demonstrates that the approach worked remarkably well.
