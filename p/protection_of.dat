5|$|Finally, the Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} if free speech is to be favoured over the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> reputation in applying a Reynolds-type defence, another issue {{that will have to}} be considered is what balance should be struck between the two competing interests. In this connection, Chan C.J. said that the court would have to decide whether freedom of expression is to be given preference over the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> reputation, whether it is a fundamental right that trumps the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> reputation unless it is shown that the defamatory statement was made maliciously, or whether it is co-equal with the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> reputation.|$|E

Establishment of the ZNG as a police force with {{military}} capabilities was thought necessary by the Croatian authorities following armed clashes in Pakrac and at Plitvice Lakes in March and due to the possibility of further confrontation with the JNA. The ZNG, formally established on 23 April, was tasked with <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> the constitutional order, maintenance of public order, anti-terrorist operations, <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> Croatia's borders, territory, coast and territorial waters, as well as the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> high-value structures and high-profile persons.|$|E

5|$|A {{key element}} to Colt's success was {{vigorous}} <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> his patent rights. Even though he lawfully held the only patent on a revolver, scores of imitators copied {{his work and}} Colt found himself constantly in litigation. In {{each one of these}} cases, Colt's lawyer, Edward N. Dickerson, deftly exploited the patent system and successfully shut down Colt's competitors. However, Colt's zealous <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> his patents greatly impeded firearms development as a whole in the United States. His preoccupation with patent infringement suits slowed his own company's transition to the cartridge system and blocked other firms from pursuing revolver designs. At the same time, Colt's policies forced some competing inventors to greater innovation by denying them key features of his mechanism; as a result they created their own.|$|E

In this paper, an {{estimation}} <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> distance <b>of</b> 500 kV arrester is given, and {{a simulation}} experiment is proceeded {{to study the}} <b>protection</b> distance <b>of</b> 500 kV arrester.

By the studying, recommended values <b>of</b> the <b>protection</b> distance <b>of</b> 500 kV arrester can be suggested. The research in this paper can also provide references to installation of arresters and the data obtained is valuable for research in this field...|$|R
