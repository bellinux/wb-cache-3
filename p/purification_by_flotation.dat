40|$|The thesis {{research}} {{was designed to}} study the characteristics of two important physiological processes in smooth muscle: Ca 2 + transport mediated by the plasmalemmal Ca 2 +-ATPase and muscarinic receptor-G protein interactions. In resting smooth muscle, several Ca 2 + extrusion or sequestration processes offset the passive inward leak of Ca 2 +. Although biochemical {{evidence suggests that the}} plasmalemmal Ca 2 + pump {{plays a key role in}} this process, the precise role of this enzyme could not be proven until a reliable estimate of the inward Ca 2 + leak was measured. Recent studies using dispersed smooth muscle cells from the toad stomach provided an estimate of the basal transmembrane Ca 2 + flux rate; thus, we examined the transport capacity of the plasmalemmal Ca 2 + pump in this tissue. Gastric smooth muscle tissue was disrupted by homogenization and nitrogen cavitation. Membranes enriched 20 fold for plasma membrane markers were obtained using differential centrifugation and <b>purification</b> <b>by</b> <b>flotation</b> on discontinuous sucrose gradients. The membrane vesicles exhibited an ATP-dependent 45 Ca uptake that was insensitive to azide or oxalate but sensitive to stimulation by calmodulin or inhibition by orthovanadate and the calmodulin antagonists trifluoperazine (TFP) or calmidazolium (CMZ). 45 Ca accumulated in the presence of ATP was rapidly released by Ca 2 + ionophore but not by agents that stimulate Ca 2 + release from the sarcoplasmic rettculum (caffeine, inositol trisphosphate, GTP). However, both CMZ and TFP evoked a Ca 2 + release that was comparable to that observed in the presence of Ca 2 + ionophore, suggesting that these compounds have profound effects on membrane Ca 2 + permeability. 45 Ca transport exhibited a high affinity for Ca 2 + (KD 0. 2 μM) and a high transport capacity, producing a 3 ̆e 12, 000 -fold gradient for Ca 2 + and a transmembrane flux rate at least 3 -fold greater than that observed in resting smooth muscle cells. As a first step toward understanding the biochemical basis for the diversity of muscarinic cholinergic actions on smooth muscle, we examined the distribution of muscarinic receptor subtypes and coupling to guantne nucleotide-binding (G) proteins in airway and gastric smooth muscle. Receptor subtypes were classified in membranes prepared from bovine trachea and toad stomach based on the relative abilities of the selective antagonists pirenzepine (M 1), AF-DX 116 (M 2) and 4 -DAMP (M 3) to displace the binding of nonselective antagonist [3 H]QNB (quinuclidinyl benzilate). Based on the binding profiles for these antagonists, it was concluded that both smooth muscle types contain a mixture of M 2 and M 3 subtypes. In trachea the majority of receptors (86...|$|E
40|$|The {{protozoan}} parasite Neospora caninum {{is one of}} {{the most}} important abortifacient organisms in cattle worldwide. The dog is known to act as definitive host although its potential role as infection source for bovines still remains unelucidated. The aim of the present study was to compile initial epidemiological data on the prevalence and incidence of N. caninum in Swiss dogs acting as definitive hosts. Thus, 249 Swiss dogs were investigated coproscopically in monthly intervals over a period of 1 year. A total of 3289 fecal samples was tested <b>by</b> the <b>flotation</b> technique. Among these, 202 were shown to contain Sarcocystis sp. (6. 1 %), 149 Cystoisospora sp. (=Isospora sp.; 4. 5 %) and 25 Hammondia/Neospora-like oocysts (HNlO) (0. 7 %). All but one sample containing HNlO were from different dogs; one dog shed HNlO at two subsequent time points. Calculation of the yearly incidence for HNlO resulted in the surprisingly high value of 9. 2 %. Farm dogs exhibited a higher incidence for HNlO than urban family dogs. Thirteen out of the 25 HNlO-samples showed sporulation after 5 days incubation at room temperature. HNlO were further differentiated by species-specific PCR. However, all HNlO-samples were negative for N. caninum, Hammondia heydorni and Toxoplasma gondii. One reason may be the low oocyst density found in most fecal samples, which did not permit us to carry out PCR under optimal conditions. Three out of the 25 HNlO-cases contained enough oocysts to allow further enrichment and <b>purification</b> <b>by</b> the <b>flotation</b> technique. Subsequently, twenty to fifty sporulated HNlO-oocysts were orally administered to Meriones unguiculatus. All gerbils were seronegative for N. caninum at 5 weeks p. i. A N. caninum-seroprevalence of 7. 8 % was determined by ELISA upon 1132 serum samples collected from dogs randomly selected by veterinarians among their clinical patients...|$|R
40|$|Giardia and Cryptosporidium {{have caused}} several {{outbreaks}} of gastroenteritis in humans associated with drinking water. Contaminated sewage effluents {{are recognized as}} a potential source of waterborne protozoa. Due {{to the lack of}} studies about the occurrence of these parasites in sewage samples in Brazil, we compared the efficiency of two procedures for concentrating cysts and oocysts in activated sludge samples of one sewage treatment plant. For this, the samples were submitted to i) concentration by the ether clarification procedure (ECP) and to ii) <b>purification</b> <b>by</b> sucrose <b>flotation</b> method (SFM) and aliquots of the pellets were examined by immunofluorescence. Giardia cysts were present in all samples (100. 0 %; n = 8) when using ECP and kit 1 reagents, while kit 2 resulted in six positive samples (85. 7 %; n = 7). As for SFM, cysts were detected in 75. 0 % and 100. 0 % of these samples (for kit 1 and 2, respectively). Regarding Cryptosporidium, two samples (25. 0 %; kit 1 and 28. 5 % for kit 2) were detected positive by using ECP, while for SFM, only one sample (examined by kit 1) was positive (12. 5 %). The results of the control trial revealed Giardia and Cryptosporidium recovery efficiency rates for ECP of 54. 5 % and 9. 6 %, while SFM was 10. 5 % and 3. 2 %, respectively. Considering the high concentration detected, a previous evaluation of the activated sludge before its application in agriculture is recommended and with some improvement, ECP would be an appropriate simple technique for protozoa detection in sewage samples...|$|R

40|$|An {{elutriator}} for {{the separation}} of cysts from not previously dried soil samples to determine the population density of Heterodera species is described. With this apparatus a mixture of cysts and organic debris is obtained. For further separation this mixture is dried and the cysts are then separated from the debris <b>by</b> <b>flotation</b> with a modification of Buhr's method using water or a mixture of three parts of acetone and one part of carbon tetrachloride. Heterodera cysts differ from practically all other material, found in soil, in that they float for a fairly long time in water after having been dried thoroughly (Fenwick, 1940). In Fenwick's extraction method the soil samples are dried prior to extraction. Cysts are then separated from soil in three steps: first the cysts are concentrated in {{a small amount of}} mainly organic material <b>by</b> <b>flotation</b> in-water, then they are separated from most of this material again <b>by</b> <b>flotation</b> in water and finally they are picked from between the soil particles which float as well in water as dry cysts.
