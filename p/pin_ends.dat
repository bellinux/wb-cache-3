50|$|For {{bicycles}} with derailleur gears, {{a special}} kind of master link has been developed to fit the narrow chains used on closely spaced sprockets. In this case, each plate has one pin protruding from it, and the <b>pin</b> <b>ends</b> are grooved. (Refer to Figures 2 and 3).

50|$|In amateur wrestling, a <b>pin</b> <b>ends</b> {{the match}} {{regardless}} of when it occurs. Situations which are almost pins but {{for whatever reason}} {{do not meet the}} criteria — for example, have only one shoulder down or have the defending wrestler blocked in a neck bridge — are rewarded with exposure points (in collegiate wrestling, known as near fall points or back points) in order to encourage wrestlers to take risks to try to pin their opponents.|$|E
50|$|The link plates fit together, {{and connect}} the chain by feeding their pins through the {{bushings}} {{of the inner}} plates, from opposite sides. In this way the pair form a loosely interconnected, closed set, with each master link's pin located in the slot of the other, and the two bushings held captive. The connection is then made secure by pulling the chain outwards {{on both sides of}} the link. This latter action forces the <b>pin</b> <b>ends</b> into the narrow ends of the slots where they become locked. The overall security of such a master link depends upon the chain being under tension in normal use, though it can fail in extreme conditions where this condition does not hold.|$|E

Long columns of todomatsu (Japanese fir,Abies sachalinensis Fr. Schmidt) with various length/thickness ratios were the specimens.

Four-point bending tests were also conducted, and the bending properties obtained were compared with the corresponding properties obtained by the compression bending tests. Based on the experimental results, we believe that when the stress-strain relation is measured by the load-loading point displacement relation using specimens whose length/thickness ratio is large enough, the bending properties can be obtained properly using the compression bending test.|$|E

Several investigations of the effects of steel pins on the mechanical properties of dental amalgam have been reported.

Three pin cross-sections were selected to study the radial concentrations of U, Np, Pu and Am in the fuel, the fuel and fission product compositions of the filled central void, the metallic and ceramic precipitates, and the fuel-clad interactions by X-ray microanalysis. The end-of-life O/M ratio of the fuel was investigated by X-ray diffraction. A strong radial redistribution of Np, Pu and Am to the gap is marked. There is a pronounced axial fuel transport along the central void to {{the upper and lower}} fuel <b>pin</b> <b>ends.</b> An influence of the pellet parameters on the relocation phenomena was not stated. The end-of-life O/M ratio of the upper end fuel region is 1. 95. The maximum inner clad corrosion is observed in the hottest upper end clad region with about 20 #mu#m thickness. A high linear heat rating is assumed in this pin region, because the central void and the gap region are completely filled with fuel up to about 60 % PuO_ 2 and high fractions of Np and Am. The thermal conductivity of the fuel is low due to the reduced O/M fuel ratio. Both effects may increase the inner clad temperature and the fuel centre temperature significantly. (orig.)

40|$|Advanced Composite Products and Technology, Inc. (ACPT) has {{developed}} composite drill pipe (CDP) {{that matches the}} structural and strength properties of steel drill pipe, but weighs less than 50 percent of its steel counterpart. Funding for the multiyear {{research and development of}} CDP was provided by the U. S. Department of Energy Office of Fossil Energy through the Natural Gas and Oil Projects Management Division at the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). Composite materials made of carbon fibers and epoxy resin offer mechanical properties comparable to steel at less than half the weight. Composite drill pipe consists of a composite material tube with standard drill pipe steel box and pin connections. Unlike metal drill pipe, composite drill pipe can be easily designed, ordered, and produced to meet specific requirements for specific applications. Because it uses standard joint connectors, CDP can be used in lieu of any part of or for the entire steel drill pipe section. For low curvature extended reach, deep directional drilling, or ultra deep onshore or offshore drilling, the increased strength to weight ratio of CDP will increase the limits in all three drilling applications. Deceased weight will reduce hauling costs and increase the amount of drill pipe allowed on offshore platforms. In extreme extended reach areas and high-angle directional drilling, drilling limits are associated with both high angle (fatigue) and frictional effects resulting from the combination of high angle curvature and/or total weight. The radius of curvature for a hole as small as 40 feet (12. 2 meters) or a build rate of 140 degrees per 100 feet is within the fatigue limits of specially designed CDP. Other properties that can be incorporated into the design and manufacture of composite drill pipe and make it attractive for specific applications are corrosion resistance, non-magnetic intervals, and abrasion resistance coatings. Since CDP has little or no electromagnetic force fields up to 74 kilohertz (KHz), a removable section of copper wire can be placed inside the composite pipe to short the tool joints electrically allowing electromagnetic signals inside the collar to induce and measure the same within the rock formation. By embedding a pair of wires in the composite section and using standard drill pipe box and <b>pin</b> <b>ends</b> equipped with a specially developed direct contact joint electrical interface, power can be supplied to measurement-while-drilling (MWD) and logging-while-drilling (LWD) bottom hole assemblies. Instantaneous high-speed data communications between near drill bit and the surface are obtainable utilizing this 'smart' drilling technology. The composite drill pipe developed by ACPT has been field tested successfully in several wells nationally and internationally. These tests were primarily for short radius and ultra short radius directional drilling. The CDP in most cases performed flawlessly with little or no appreciable wear. ACPT is currently marketing a complete line of composite drill collars, subs, isolators, casing, and drill pipe to meet the drilling industry's needs and tailored to replace metal for specific application requirements...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{temperature}} of the steel tube of a CFT column rises rapidly upon a fire causing the deterioration of its strength, while the concrete inside of the tube having large heat capacity provides fire-resistance performance. In order to employ CFT columns as fire-resistant structure, {{it is necessary to}} conduct studies on the factors exerting influence on structural capacities and the influence associated with each condition. Concrete’s compressive strength, cross-sectional size, axial load ratio and boundary condition are the major factors which are influential in fire-resistance performance. In particular, boundary condition between columns and beams {{is one of the major}} factors which decide fire-resistance performance because it exerts influence on load carrying capacity. The result of the test conducted in this study showed that fire-resistance time of 106 minutes was secured in the specimens with clamped ends and that of 89 minutes in those with <b>pinned</b> <b>ends</b> when cross-sectional size was 360 by 360.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a formulation for the modeling of a single-link flexible beam that is undergoing slewing motion at an actively controlled <b>pinned</b> <b>end,</b> {{where the other}} end of the beam is free. This <b>pinned</b> <b>end,</b> or slewing axis, is of fixed orientation such that the beam rotates in the horizontal plane. A geared dc electric motor is connected to the beam at the slewing axis. A position and a velocity sensor are placed at this hinged location, and their proportional feedback provides a position control system about the slewing axis. The motor characteristics, gear ratio, and the position feedback constant determine an equivalent rotational spring constant, often called the servo stiffness. This paper generalizes the structure's boundary conditions at the slewing axis to include the effects of the servo system. It is shown that the clamped-free beam assumption for the dynamics of the structure is a valid assumption if the ratio of the servo stiffness to beam flexibility is high. However, for moderate or low values of this ratio, the clamped-free beam leads to erroneous system models so that it becomes necessary to consider the effects of the driving servo on the dynamics of the flexible beam...|$|R

If there is no bias favouring the <b>pin</b> <b>end,</b> or more particularly if the starboard (committee boat) end is favoured (further to windward), competitors will be encouraged to avoid being on the line away from the committee boat and so the committee boat area becomes very congested and most competitors are not on the start line and do not start until some time after the starting signal as they have been queued up in the area to starboard of the starboard end of the line.
