They are then legally identified as Limousin (i.e. 100% Limousin) – the breed code 34 often substitutes for the word Limousin in French discussions and reports on cattle breeding.|$|E

For example, high-temperature crucibles made of iridium {{are used in}} the Czochralski <b>process</b> <b>to</b> produce oxide single-crystals (such as sapphires) for use in computer memory devices and in solid state lasers. The crystals, such as gadolinium gallium garnet and yttrium gallium garnet, are grown by melting pre-sintered charges of mixed oxides under oxidizing conditions at temperatures up to 2100°C.|$|E
5|$|Due to an overcommitment of {{resources}} {{early in the}} war, the Australian economy suffered badly from manpower shortages as early as 1942. As a result, the government began the demobilisation process before the war was even over, and when it had finally come to an end, the government was necessarily very keen for the demobilisation <b>process</b> <b>to</b> be completed as quickly as possible. Understandably, defence issues were not given a high priority as people tried to rebuild their lives {{after the war and}} as such it was not until 1948 that the Citizen Military Forces (CMF) was reformed.|$|E

5|$|Even though Britain led {{the world}} in steel production, the Royal Navy was slow to adopt steel warships. The Bessemer process for steel {{manufacture}} produced too many imperfections for large-scale use on ships. French manufacturers used the Siemens-Martin <b>process</b> <b>to</b> produce adequate steel, but British technology lagged behind. The first all-steel warships built by the Royal Navy were the dispatch vessels Iris and Mercury, laid down in 1875 and 1876.|$|E

As with the other characters of Phineas and Ferb, Ferb's design is constructed of geometric shapes in homage to animator Tex Avery. Ferb's head is based on a rectangle with a wider top than bottom. A square is used for his nose, and an egg-shaped oval is used for his eyes. The eye furthest from the screen is always drawn larger than the other. Povenmire uses a nine-step <b>process</b> <b>to</b> draw Ferb, starting with his head and ending with touch ups.|$|E

5|$|Gaseous {{diffusion}} {{had been}} used to separate isotopes before. Francis William Aston had used it to partially separate isotopes of neon in 1931, and Gustav Ludwig Hertz had improved on the method to almost completely separate neon by running it through a series of stages.
