40|$|Baroreflex {{activity}} was assessed in 10 fetal lambs at 85 - 145 days of gestation. ECG leads sewn to the fetal chest wall, vinyl catheters in brachial artery and femoral vein, and a balloon catheter in the descending aorta were exteriorized through the ewe's flank. After at least 36 hours, the reflex bradycardia, {{in response to}} increased blood pressure by balloon inflation, was measured. Baroreflex sensitivity was expressed as {{the slope of the}} beat-to-beat relationship between systolic (S. <b>P.)</b> <b>or</b> pulse (<b>P.</b> P.) pressure and the subsequent R-R interval or instantaneous heart rate (H. R.). Baroreflex {{activity was}} considered absent if the slope did not differ significandy from zero or if the correlation coefficient was less than 0. 7. Throughout gestation baroreceptors could respond to pressure elevation, but the proportion of positive responses increased with age. Baroreflex sensitivity increased up to term when either S. <b>P.</b> <b>or</b> <b>P.</b> P. were plotted against the next R-R interval.

40|$|Abstract: Two {{hundred and}} forty avian {{broilers}} were equally {{divided into four}} groups, and raised with a corn-soybean basal diet or the same diet supplemented with 300, 600, 900 mg/kg NiCl 2 for 42 days. Numbers or percentages of apoptotic splenocytes by flow cytometry (FCM) and TUNEL were higher (p < 0. 05 <b>or</b> <b>p</b> < 0. 01) in the 300, 600 and 900 mg/kg groups {{than those in the}} control group. Results measured by qRT-PCR and ELISA showed that mRNA expression and contents were significantly higher (p < 0. 05 <b>or</b> <b>p</b> < 0. 01) in Bax and Caspase- 3, and were significantly lower (p < 0. 05 <b>or</b> <b>p</b> < 0. 01) in Bcl- 2 of the 300, 600 and 900 mg/kg groups. Also, the SOD, CAT and GSH-Px activities, and the ability to inhibit hydroxyl radical, and GSH contents were significantly decreased (p < 0. 05 <b>or</b> <b>p</b> < 0. 01), and MDA contents were increased (p < 0. 05 <b>or</b> <b>p</b> < 0. 01) in all groups. In conclusion, dietary NiCl 2 in excess of 300 mg/kg caused apoptosis, altered Bax, Bcl- 2 and Caspase- 3 mRNA expression levels and contents, and induced oxidative stress in the spleen. Also, splenocyte apoptosis was closely related to the alternations of Bax, Bcl- 2 and Caspase- 3 mRNA expression, and oxidative damage. The splenic immunity and bloo...|$|R
