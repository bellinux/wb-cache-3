40|$|Abstract: The idea {{of hybrid}} <b>photovoltaic-thermal</b> {{collectors}} (PV-TCs) {{is based on}} the simultaneous operation of a photovoltaic laminate and a thermal collector attached as a thermal absorber. PV-TCs have improved electrical efficiency, due to the decrease of the photovoltaic panel temperature. The thermal efficiency of PV-TCs is also remarkable. This research aims to simulate and define PV-TCs electrical and thermal efficiency. After the theoretical simulation of a PV-TC, its electrical and thermal efficiency is calculated and compared respectively to the electrical efficiency of a photovoltaic panel and to the thermal efficiency of a conventional solar collector. This comparison leads to significant conclusions concerning the PV-TC overall efficiency in relation to its surface area. The theoretical study of a <b>photovoltaic-thermal</b> system for domestic heating and cooling in the region of Rhodes resulted that the system can cover a remarkable percentage of the domestic heating and cooling demands.

40|$|Due to European Directives (2010 / 31 /UE on {{buildings}} energy performance, 2009 / 28 /CE {{on the use}} {{of renewable}} energy, 2012 / 27 /UE on the energy efficiency) the electric and thermal energy needs of new and retrofitted buildings are faced by increasing percentages of renewable energy. Solar energy and heat pumps are the most promising technologies mainly in residential buildings as they have reached great maturity. Anyway, in most cases solar energy utilizations systems are thermal (which convert solar energy to thermal energy) and photovoltaic (which convert solar energy to electricity) used as separated collectors. Commercial photovoltaic modules have nowadays an efficiency around 15 % - 18 %. It means that the most relevant part of solar radiation is lost. Such a remark gets more importance if the active surface is located in an urban environment, where the availability of surfaces exposed to the sun is scarce if compared to the buildings thermal loads. PhotoVoltaic / Thermal cogeneration (PV/T) aims to utilize the same area both for producing electricity and heat. As solar cells are sensitive to temperature (their efficiency lowers when temperature increases), heat is beneficially collected but it cannot be available at high temperatures. Many researches on performances and characteristics of different hybrid <b>photovoltaic–thermal</b> technologies and systems have been carried out during the last years to face this problem; among these designs, systems utilizing air, liquid, heat pipes, phase change materials, and thermoelectric devices to aid cooling of PV cells. This paper provides a description of the applications of the <b>photovoltaic–thermal</b> systems, such as building integrated PV/T, concentrating PV/T systems and <b>photovoltaic–thermal</b> heat pump systems.

This thesis {{is focused on}} energy performance of different configurations of building integrated <b>photovoltaic-thermal</b> (BIPV/T) and HVAC system that utilize recovered heat. A dynamic model for Concordia solar house which included an open loop air-cooled BIPV/T roof system was developed. The thermal network approach with explicit finite difference method was used to simulate the thermal behaviour of the house. The system studied included an air-water heat exchanger for preheating domestic hot water (DHW), water tank and rockbed storage. Predicted temperatures of the preheated air in the BfPV/T systems, PV panels and DHW were obtained and verified with data collected from the solar house. Results showed the dependence of thermo-electrical performance of the BIPV/T roof on the ambient conditions, air velocity, length and PV cavity depth. For the unglazed BIPV/T system, the heated air is suitable {{to be used as}} a preheated air in the HVAC system; for the same reason, thermal rockbed storage is not beneficial for extreme winter conditions with unglazed BIPV/T open loop air system.
