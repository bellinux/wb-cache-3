5|$|The {{sociology}} {{of health and}} illness focuses on the social effects of, and <b>public</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward, illnesses, diseases, mental health and disabilities. This sub-field also overlaps with gerontology {{and the study of}} the ageing process. Medical sociology, by contrast, focuses on the inner-workings of medical organizations and clinical institutions. In Britain, sociology was introduced into the medical curriculum following the Goodenough Report (1944).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} American’s {{attitude toward}} alcohol, past and present. History {{has shown that}} <b>public</b> <b>attitude</b> toward alcohol shifts from positive to negative every 80 years. There are other factors that influence the diffusion of breweries into America culture. These factors include: opinion leaders, opinion leaders and their entrance into the S curve, technology, and political influence. The <b>public</b> <b>attitude</b> toward alcohol, today, is positive. It is important for modern microbreweries to understand the variance in <b>public</b> <b>attitude</b> that can occur over the years. It is vital for small breweries, which focus their brewing method on traditional methods, {{to be aware of}} the possibility of a decline in positive <b>public</b> <b>attitude.</b> This presentation was withdrawn from SOURCE, 2014...|$|R

5|$|Four {{years later}} <b>public</b> <b>attitudes</b> had changed little. When Ian Harvey, a junior Foreign Office {{minister}} in Harold Macmillan's government, {{was found guilty}} of indecent behaviour with a Coldstream Guardsman in November 1958, he lost both his ministerial job and his parliamentary seat at Harrow East. He was ostracised by the Conservative Party and by most of his former friends, and never again held a position in public life. Thus, anyone entering politics at that time knew that revelations of homosexual activity would likely bring such a career to a swift end.|$|E
5|$|The parkway {{was one of}} {{two phases}} to build an {{expressway}} bypass {{on the south side of}} Hamilton. Despite this, plans for both The Linc as well as the Red Hill Valley Parkway appeared simultaneously in 1963, when Hamilton City Council approved the 'Hamilton Area Transportation Study' which included the Highway53 Freeway as one of five proposed expressways. These were subsequently added to the city's official plan in 1964. However, political change and shifting <b>public</b> <b>attitudes</b> would soon reject the idea of inner-city expressways, instead shifting the focus to public transportation. The cancellation of the Spadina Expressway in Toronto was the turning point in this shift.|$|E
5|$|<b>Public</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards feral cats vary widely, {{ranging from}} seeing them as free-ranging pets, to {{regarding}} them as vermin. One common approach to reducing the feral cat population is termed 'trap-neuter-return', where the cats are trapped, neutered, immunized against {{diseases such as}} rabies and the feline Panleukopenia and Leukemia viruses, and then released. Before releasing them back into their feral colonies, the attending veterinarian often nips the tip off one ear to mark it as neutered and inoculated, since these cats may be trapped again. Volunteers continue to feed and give care to these cats throughout their lives. Given this support, their lifespans are increased, and behavior and nuisance problems caused by competition for food are reduced.|$|E

5|$|From 1937 Burnet was {{involved}} in a variety of scientific and public policy bodies, starting with a position on a government advisory council on polio. After he became the director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in 1944, he was considered a public figure and overcame shyness to become a good public speaker. He recognised the importance of co-operation with the media if the general public was to understand science and scientists, and his writings and lectures played an important part in the formulation of <b>public</b> <b>attitudes</b> and policy in Australia on a variety of biological topics. However, despite making many appearances on radio and television, he never became at ease with interviews and had to be selective with outreach engagements due to the many invitations he received, and tended to accept those that had the potential to promote the Institute. Over time, he began to increase his activism, as he felt more confident that {{he would be able to}} make an impact as his reputation grew, especially after winning the Nobel Prize, and even more so after his retirement from the directorship of the Institute. Although Burnet was not naturally outgoing, he saw it as the social responsibility of a scientific leader and scholar to publicly speak out and impart wisdom and foresight to the wider community.|$|E

In a July 2017 poll, Muslims who say homosexuality should be accepted by society clearly outnumber those who say it should be discouraged (52% versus 33%).|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1990 This {{research}} questions {{the effectiveness of}} newspapers as a vehicle of environmental information by determining whether the <b>public</b> <b>attitude</b> in Alaska towards off-shore oil exploration was consistent with that expressed in the local newspapers. All newspaper articles about off-shore oil exploration published in Alaska between 1980 and May 1987 were examined for content (pro-environment, pro-economy or neutral) and readability level. Two surveys of samples of Alaska residents were conducted in 1985 and 1987 to determine <b>public</b> knowledge and <b>attitude</b> towards off-shore oil exploration. Comparison of the content analysis with the <b>public</b> <b>attitude</b> surveys showed important and consistent differences. In 1985 the newspaper articles were stressing environmental concerns while the <b>public's</b> <b>attitude</b> was pro-economy. The newspaper articles gradually became more pro-economy oriented by 1987, while during the period surveyed the public shifted to a pro-environment attitude. The differences between attitudes {{members of the public}} and newspaper perspective could not be attributed to the readability level of the newspapers. The notion that newspapers are an effective means of communicating environmental information was not valid for Alaskan newspapers between 1980 and 1987...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the problem of whether the <b>public's</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward economic well-being could be compared with the types of television programs made popular over a thirty-year period. Two measures were used to determine the <b>public's</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward economic well-being: 1) answers to questions of an economic nature; and 2) answers to questions that asked what was the most important problem. All data were compiled from Gallup polls administered during 1955 through 1984. The television genre data were compiled from sources by Brooks and Marsh, McNeil and Norback and Broadcasting magazine. No association existed among the three measures...|$|R

25|$|Codified in 1859, Australian {{football}} {{had been}} played by men {{for almost half}} a century before the first women's football matches were played. Contact sports such as football were widely considered unsuitable for women at the time, and <b>public</b> <b>attitudes</b> prevented them from participating in organised matches. Exceptions included charity matches, such as patriotic fundraisers, which occasionally featured women players. Women have nonetheless followed the Australian game passionately since the mid-19th century, comprising approximately 50% of spectators at matches—a uniquely high figure among football codes.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{discovery}} in 1963 that eastern wolves answered human imitations of their howls, Algonquin Provincial Park began its Public Wolf Howls attraction, where {{as many as}} 2,500 visitors are led on expeditions into areas where eastern wolves were sighted {{the night before and}} listen to them answering the Park staff's imitation howls. By 2000, 85 Public Wolf Howls had been held, with over 110,000 people having participated. The Park considers the attraction as the cornerstone of its wolf education program, and credits it with changing <b>public</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards wolves in Ontario.|$|E
25|$|Scientific {{claims about}} {{hardwired}} sex differences interact with people’s minds {{as they are}} communicated {{to the public in}} popular books and articles. ‘Brain facts’ have become increasingly popular and persuasive on <b>public</b> <b>attitudes</b> due to the increased fascination with neuroscience. Suggestions made in public domains that sex differences in achievement in science, mathematics or philosophy can be explained by innate brain differences can have important psychological effects. Haslam and colleagues found that emphasis on the biological causes of sex differences in intelligence suggests inevitability and fixedness, creating essentialist beliefs about gender that deepen social divides.|$|E

25|$|Twin studies, {{adoption}} studies, {{and artificial}} selection {{studies have shown}} that a person's genes can predispose them to developing alcoholism. Evidence from twin studies show that concordance rates for alcoholism are higher for monozygotic twins than dizygotic twins—76% for monozygotic twins and 61% for dizygotic twins. However, female twin studies demonstrate that females have much lower concordance rates than males. Reasons for gender differences may be due to environmental factors, such as negative <b>public</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards female drinkers. Twin studies suggest that males {{are more likely to have}} a genetic predisposition for alcoholism. However, this does not suggest that a male who does have a genetic predisposition will become an alcoholic. Sometimes the individual may never encounter an environmental trigger that leads to alcoholism.|$|E
25|$|Critical race theory {{developed}} in the 1970s and 1980s, influenced by the language of critical legal studies, which challenged concepts such as objective truth, rationality and judicial neutrality, and by critical theory. Academics and activists disillusioned with the outcomes of the civil African-American Civil Rights Movement pointed out that though African Americans supposedly enjoyed legal equality, white Americans continued to hold disproportionate power and still had superior living standards. Liberal ideas such as meritocracy and equal opportunity, they argued, hid and reinforced deep structural inequalities and thus serves the interests of a white elite. Critical race theorists see racism as embedded in <b>public</b> <b>attitudes</b> and institutions, and highlight institutional racism and unconscious biases. Legal scholar Derrick Bell advanced the interest convergence principle, which suggests that whites support minority rights only when doing so is also in their self-interest.|$|E

40|$|Background: Understanding <b>public</b> <b>attitude</b> towards dentists {{and dental}} {{services}} helps both dental service providers and planners. Hence, {{this study was}} conducted to assess <b>public</b> <b>attitude</b> toward dentists and dental services in Bangalore city, India. Methods: Two thousand residents of Bangalore city were selected through multistage cluster sampling method. A structured questionnaire containing statements pertaining to <b>public</b> <b>attitude</b> toward dentists and dental services in Bangalore city was administered to the subjects. Five point Likert scale was used to measure the attitude. Results: About 67. 8 % of the study subjects had visited a dentist in their lifetime. Negative attitudes were observed regarding waiting time, cleanliness of instruments and dentist advising patients to give up unhealthy practices such as smoking, drinking and pan chewing. Positive attitude was found regarding availability of dental services near place of residence or work, modern equipments being used for treatment and the nobleness of the dental professionals. About 67 % of study subjects felt that dental services are expensive. Only 65 % agree that regular check-ups prevent dental diseases and 33 % of the study subjects agree that dental treatment can be delayed if there are other expenses. Conclusions: Subjects generally had positive attitude toward dentists and dental services. Certain factors like waiting time and cleanliness elicited negative response...|$|R
