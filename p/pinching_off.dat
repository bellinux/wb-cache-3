25|$|Three {{corps of}} Malinovsky's 2nd Ukrainian Front had {{sustained}} significant {{losses in the}} fighting and the intended rapid 2nd Ukrainian Front assault on Budapest had been delayed. The Nyíregyháza counter-attack {{was the last time}} that German forces were to defeat a full-strength Red Army force on even terms. By <b>pinching</b> <b>off</b> the breakthrough exploitation group of the 2nd Ukrainian Front offensive, the Germans were able to re-establish a stable front line position, and thus, prevent the 2nd Ukrainian Front's advance from becoming a catastrophe for Wöhler. The German success, was however short-lived as Nyíregyháza was captured by the Red Army on 30 October, and another powerful Red Army offensive opened to the south with Budapest again being its objective, with the Soviets reaching the area of the Hungarian capital on 7 November 1944.|$|E
500|$|The Battle of Kursk was a Second World War {{engagement}} between German and Soviet {{forces on}} the Eastern Front near Kursk ( [...] south-west of Moscow) in the Soviet Union during [...] July and August 1943. The battle began with {{the launch of the}} German offensive, Operation Citadel (...) , on 5 July, which had the objective of <b>pinching</b> <b>off</b> the Kursk salient with attacks on the base of the salient from north and south simultaneously. After the German offensive stalled on the northern side of the salient, on 12 July the Soviets commenced their Kursk Strategic Offensive Operation with the launch of Operation Kutuzov (...) against the rear of the German forces in the northern side. On the southern side, the Soviets also launched powerful counterattacks the same day, one of which led to a large armoured clash, the Battle of Prokhorovka. On 3 August, the Soviets began {{the second phase of the}} Kursk Strategic Offensive Operation with the launch of [...] Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev (...) against the German forces in the southern side of the Kursk salient.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe <b>pinch</b> <b>off</b> of {{heterogeneous}} ferrofluid drops at {{a nozzle}} in air was experimentally investigated with {{a magnetic field}} (downward or upward) and without a magnetic field. Compared to homogeneous drops, the self-similarity and universal scaling law were verified through modifying the initial conditions, such as the nozzle diameter, flow rate, and magnitude {{and direction of the}} magnetic fields. Two pinch-off points were observed, and the two consecutive pinch-off dynamics were characterized through scaling laws. Here our scaling exponent remains within the scope of (0. 70 - 0. 80) for the primary whereas it remains within the scope of (0. 60 - 0. 70) for the secondary <b>pinch</b> <b>off,</b> respectively, comparable to the classic range from 2 / 3 to 1 for homogeneous drops. The gravity-compensating and gravity-superimposing magnetic fields display a negligible effect on the exponent but determine the sequence of double <b>pinch</b> <b>offs.</b> The universal character of the self-similar <b>pinch</b> <b>off</b> is extended to a heterogeneous fluid...|$|R

2500|$|Authors {{including}} McCarthy and McAuley {{have questioned}} {{whether it was}} necessary to engage the Japanese in a costly battle or whether they could have been contained and reduced by starvation. [...] Both concluded that a battle was necessary and that a victory was necessary for the Allies and not just MacArthur. Condon-Rall and Cowdrey have a similar position but a different rational, citing Eichelberger, who wrote that disease [...] "was a surer and more deadly peril to us than enemy marksmanship. We had to whip the Japanese before the malarial mosquito whipped us." [...] However, it is difficult not to question whether this victory could have been achieved without the loss that was incurred. It is clear that undue pressure for haste exacerbated the Allies losses. It is also apparent that the process of <b>pinching</b> <b>off</b> or infiltrating the Japanese defences produced results where repeated assaults failed to produce any gain. The losses suffered by the Australian forces limited their offensive capacity for [...] "months" [...] following the battle.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{proteins}} have {{folded and}} {{are ready to}} be transported out of the ER {{it is thought that}} they assemble at specific site within the ER called [...] "ER exit sites". These sites can be transient but are most likely situated in the ER where the ER is close to the next transport compartment, the vesicular-tubular cluster (VTC) (also referred to as the ER-Golgi Intermediate Compartment (ERGIC)). The details of how proteins are concentrated or localized to the exit site is unclear (some aspects are emerging!) but the actual process of budding a vesicle containing these proteins start with a protein called Sec12. This protein recruits a small GTPase called Sar1 (think of Sar1 as a switch, it is active when bound to GTP and inactive when it hydrolyses the GTP to GDP). This in turn leads to the recruitment of a protein complex, the Sec23/Sec24 and the Sec13/Sec31 complex (also known as the COPII coat). In a nutshell what these proteins do is form a mesh at the ER exit site and the mesh through mechanical curvature forms a little [...] "blob" [...] that pinches off from the ER with proteins inside (think, playdough as the ER and your hand as the Sec complex <b>pinching</b> <b>off</b> little bits). The mesh disassembles off the budded vesicle when Sar1 hydrolyses the GTP to GDP. Interestingly, this activity of Sar1 is enhanced by Sec23/24.|$|E

40|$|The {{recent work}} of Gharib, Rambod, and Shariff [J. Fluid Mech. 360, 121 (1998) ] studied vortex rings formed by {{starting}} jets generated using a piston-cylinder mechanism. Their {{results showed that}} vortex rings generated from starting jets stop forming and <b>pinch</b> <b>off</b> from the generating jet for sufficiently large values of the piston stroke to diameter ratio (L/D), suggesting a maximization principle may exist for propulsion utilizing starting jets. The importance of vortex ring formation and <b>pinch</b> <b>off</b> to propulsion, however, rests on the relative contribution of the leading vortex ring and the trailing jet (which appears after <b>pinch</b> <b>off)</b> to the impulse supplied to the flow. To resolve {{the relative importance of}} the vortex ring and trailing jet for propulsion, a piston-cylinder mechanism attached to a force balance is used to investigate the impulse and thrust generated by starting jets for L/D ratios in the range 2 – 8. Two different velocity programs are used, providing two different L/D values beyond which <b>pinch</b> <b>off</b> is observed, {{in order to determine the}} effect of vortex ring <b>pinch</b> <b>off.</b> Measurements of the impulse associated with vortex ring formation show it to be much larger than that expected from the jet velocity alone and proportionally larger than that associated with a trailing jet for L/D large enough to observe <b>pinch</b> <b>off.</b> The latter result leads to a local maximum in the average thrust during a pulse near L/D values associated with vortex rings whose circulation has been maximized. These results are shown to be related to the nozzle exit over-pressure generated during vortex ring formation. The over-pressure is in turn shown to be associated with the acceleration of ambient fluid by vortex ring formation in the form of added and entrained mass...|$|R

30|$|In Figure 6 a, we can {{recognize}} {{the effect of}} the gate on channel in a DG structure which is more effective than SG due to the asymmetry of SG.

The trend for drain conductance is the same with MOSFETs [41] and JLTs [42], yet the slope is smaller here which can be explained by low doping concentration and current value.|$|R

50|$|Drafting {{is done by}} <b>pinching</b> <b>off</b> a short {{section of}} the rolag, and then pulling back while twist is added to it.

The passive hand {{controls}} how much twist is allowed in the drafting yarn: too much twist and the yarn won't draft; too little and the yarn will break. Twist concentrates in the thin areas of the yarn, solidifying these.

50|$|The {{cell wall}} is {{important}} for cell division, which, in most bacteria, occurs by binary fission. This process usually requires a cell wall and components of the bacterial cytoskeleton such as FtsZ. The ability of L-form bacteria to grow and divide {{in the absence of}} both of these structures is highly unusual, and may represent a form of cell division that was important in early forms of life. This novel mode of division seems to involve the extension of thin protrusions from the cell's surface and these protrusions then <b>pinching</b> <b>off</b> to form new cells. The lack of cell wall in L-forms means that division is disorganised, giving rise to a variety of cell sizes, from very tiny to very big.|$|E
