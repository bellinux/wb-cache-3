40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the microalgal dewatering efficiency of a belt filter system for feed concentrations below 10  g dry wt. /L. A prototype belt filtration system designed for 50  g dry wt. /L microalgal feed concentration was used for this investigation. The highest concentration of microalgal suspension available for testing on the prototype belt filtration system was 6  g dry wt. /L obtained from biomass settling tanks at the Lawrence, Kansas domestic wastewater <b>treatment</b> <b>plant.</b> For <b>preparation</b> of feed suspension with concentrations below 10  g dry wt. /L, microalgal cultivation was followed by flocculation. A mixed laboratory culture of freshwater species dominated by three eukaryotic green microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris, Scenedesmus sp., and Kirchneriella sp.) was cultivated in wastewater effluent. This was followed by flocculation which resulted in a microalgal feed suspension concentration of 4  g dry wt. /L. Belt dewatering tests were conducted on microalgal suspensions with feed concentrations of 4  g dry wt. /L and 6  g dry wt. /L. The maximum microalgal recovery with the belt dewatering system was 46 % from the 4  g dry wt. /L, and 84 % from the 6  g dry wt. /L suspensions respectively. The results of this study indicate that microalgal suspension concentrations as low as 6  g dry wt. /L can be recovered with a belt filter system improving the overall dewatering efficiency of the system...|$|R

In 1996, the RDN Board requested the Ministries of Health and Environment cease approval of package <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> for strata and other private developments within the RDN, except where the application had first been referred to the RDN for review and approval. The RDN passed this resolution because it was concerned about the following: Package <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> may be approved on a site-by-site basis with no assessment of the cumulative impact of such approvals. Package <b>treatment</b> <b>plant</b> approval might conflict with the RDN’s strategy to provide community sewer service. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to figure out the effects of nitrogen fertilizer on the infection of C. cassiicola (Berk &Curt) Wei, the causal agent of leaf fall disease of rubber (Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg.). The research was conducted in greenhouse and hytopathological laboratory of the Department of Plant Pests ad Disease, Faculty of Agriculture, Sriwjaya University, from September to November 2005. The experiment was arranged in Completely Randomized Design with six treatments and five replications. The treatment were A (control, 0 g nitrogen each <b>plant),</b> <b>treatment</b> B (2 g nitrogen each <b>plant),</b> <b>treatment</b> C (4 g nitrogen each <b>plant),</b> <b>treatment</b> D (6 g nitrogen each <b>plant),</b> <b>treatment</b> E (82 g nitrogen each <b>plant),</b> <b>treatment</b> F (10 g nitrogen each plant). Pathogen inoculation was done by spraying spore suspension at spore density of 4 x 104 spore/ml. The spore used were harvested from C. cassiicola (Berk &Curt) Wei cultured on sterile rubber leaves. The parameters observed were incubation period, disease intensity, leaf spot area and latent period. The results showed that nitrogen fertilizer did not significantly affect incubation period but high-significantly affected disease intensity and significantly affected leaf spot area. The incubation period of C. cassiicola (Berk &Curt) Wei averagely ranged from 17. 8 to 21. 2 days. The disease intensity averagely ranged from 19. 78 t 0 45. 97 percents and lesion area averagely ranged from 0. 168 to 1. 267 cm 2.

DGGE analysis of PCR-amplified 16 S rRNA genes revealed that alfalfa (Medicago sativa) had a dominant effect on the structure of rhizosphere microbial communities in mixed <b>plant</b> <b>treatments,</b> stimulating relative increases in specific Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria populations. Alfalfa and mixes containing alfalfa, while supporting 100 times more culturable PAH degraders than other treatments, exhibited only 10 % TPH reduction, less than all <b>planted</b> <b>treatments</b> except perennial rye grass (Lolium perenne).

Results of measurement indicate that the biodegradation of poly(c-caprotactone) without additives was very fast in compost with <b>plant</b> <b>treatment</b> active sludge and after six weeks the polymer film was completely assimilated.
