25|$|There are {{two common}} methods for {{extending}} the <b>polar</b> <b>coordinate</b> system to three dimensions. In the cylindrical coordinate system, a z-coordinate {{with the same}} meaning as in Cartesian coordinates {{is added to the}} r and θ polar coordinates giving a triple (r,θ,z). Spherical coordinates take this a step further by converting the pair of cylindrical coordinates (r,z) to polar coordinates (ρ,φ) giving a triple (ρ,θ,φ).|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, the {{dimension}} of an object is an intrinsic property independent of the space in which the object is embedded. For example, a point on the unit circle in the plane can be specified by two Cartesian coordinates, but a single <b>polar</b> <b>coordinate</b> (the angle) would be sufficient, so the circle is 1-dimensional even though it exists in the 2-dimensional plane. This intrinsic notion of dimension {{is one of the}} chief ways the mathematical notion of dimension differs from its common usages.|$|E

25|$|Also in the 9th century, the Persian {{mathematician}} and geographer, Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi, employed {{spherical trigonometry}} and map projection methods {{in order to}} convert polar coordinates to a different coordinate system centred on a specific point on the sphere, in this the Qibla, the direction to Mecca. Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī (973–1048) later developed ideas which are seen as an anticipation of the <b>polar</b> <b>coordinate</b> system. Around 1025, he describes a polar equi-azimuthal equidistant projection of the celestial sphere.

The full history of the subject is described in Harvard professor Julian Lowell Coolidge's Origin of <b>Polar</b> <b>Coordinates.</b> Grégoire de Saint-Vincent and Bonaventura Cavalieri independently introduced the concepts in the mid-seventeenth century. Saint-Vincent wrote about them privately in 1625 and published his work in 1647, while Cavalieri published his in 1635 with a corrected version appearing in 1653.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{introduces}} {{a family of}} integer-to-integer approximations to the Cartesian-to-polar coordinate transformation and analyzes its application to lossy compression. A high-rate analysis is provided for an encoder that first uniformly scalar quantizes, then transforms to “integer <b>polar</b> <b>coordinates,</b> ” and finally separately entropy codes angle and radius. For sources separable in <b>polar</b> <b>coordinates,</b> the performance (at high rate) is shown to match that of entropy-constrained unconstrained polar quantization—where the angular quantization is allowed {{to depend on the}} radius. Thus, for sources separable in <b>polar</b> <b>coordinates</b> but not separable in rectangular coordinates— including certain Gaussian scale mixtures—the proposed system performs better than any transform code. Furthermore, unlike unconstrained polar quantization, integer <b>polar</b> <b>coordinates</b> are appropriate for lossless compression of integer-valued vectors.

40|$|Abstract. A {{new class}} of spline curves in <b>polar</b> <b>coordinates</b> has beenpresented in [11] and {{independently}} considered in [5].

Moreover, an ad hoc algorithmof degree elevation for splines in <b>polar</b> <b>coordinates</b> is presented, and its efficiency and stability is proved. x 1. Introduction Recently, in [11] a class of spline curves in <b>polar</b> <b>coordinates</b> was proposed. We refer to these curves as p-splines. They {{have proved to be}} a generalization of those considered in [10], which we call p-B'ezier curves. The p-splines were independently considered in [5], and called Focal splines. These classes of curves are interesting because they allow for modelling and interpolation of free forms in <b>polar</b> <b>coordinates</b> with the same facilities as Cartesian splines...|$|R
