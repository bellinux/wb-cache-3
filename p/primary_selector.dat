5000|$|Each {{religion}} {{asserts that}} it is a means by which its adherents may come into closer contact with God, Truth, and Spiritual Power. They all promise to free adherents from spiritual bondage, and bring them into spiritual freedom. It naturally follows that a religion which frees its adherents from deception, sin, and spiritual death will have significant mental health benefits. Abraham Maslow's research after World War II showed that Holocaust survivors tended to be those who held strong religious beliefs (not necessarily temple attendance, etc.), suggesting it helped people cope in extreme circumstances. Humanistic psychology went on to investigate how religious or spiritual identity may have correlations with longer lifespan and better health. The study found that humans may particularly need religious ideas to serve various emotional needs such as the need to feel loved, the need to belong to homogeneous groups, the need for understandable explanations and the need for a guarantee of ultimate justice. Other factors may involve sense of purpose, sense of identity, sense of contact with the divine. See also Man's Search for Meaning, by Victor Frankl, detailing his experience with the importance of religion in surviving the Holocaust. Critics assert that the very fact that religion was the <b>primary</b> <b>selector</b> for research subjects may have introduced a bias, and that the fact that all subjects were holocaust survivors may also have had an effect. According to Larson et al. (2000), [...] "more longitudinal research with better multidimensional measures will help further clarify the roles of these religious factors and whether they are beneficial or harmful." ...|$|E
40|$|The weaning process varies {{considerably}} among human populations, {{but it is}} not yet {{understood why}} this is the case. With this in mind, I used data from natural fertility societies to test two evolutionary theory-based hypotheses concerning variation in the timing of key events in the weaning process. First, I evaluated the null hypothesis that this variation simply reflects population history. I then tested the hypothesis that risk of resource failure affects weaning variation. Among-population variation in weaning behaviour is not correlated with the proxy I employed for population history and is only weakly correlated with some of the proxies for risk of resource failure. Thus, my analyses refute the population history hypothesis and provide only limited support for the risk hypothesis. Together, these results suggest that among-population variation in weaning behaviour is shaped by selection but, contrary to expectations, risk of resource failure is not the <b>primary</b> <b>selector...</b>|$|E
40|$|Often {{mismatches}} between {{learning and}} teaching styles arise because students are in majority visual and sensing learners, and most instructors are intuitive and reflective learners. Beside that, textbooks also have their own styles, and their contents, depth of coverage of materials, and organization may affect {{the teaching and learning}} environment. Instructor, as the <b>primary</b> <b>selector</b> of the textbook, has the responsibility in providing students with effective teaching strategy. Here, we present a new strategy called the ‘workbook strategy, ” which integrates these four elements: (i) classroom analysis, (ii) use of workbook beside textbook, (iii) group work, and (iv) use of ‘blackboard ’ as information technology. The workbook strategy provides verbal and visual elements of the course material in an organized way, and relates fundamentals to applications. Such strategy may reduce the mismatches between {{learning and teaching}} styles, and hence improves active learning, critical thinking, and problem solving skills. Most of the students who are exposed to the workbook strategy have found it very effective in their learning. 1...|$|E
5000|$|In 1995, when Women On Their Way was launched, it {{was based}} on a simple premise: to listen and respond to women {{travelers}} and make travel better for everyone as a result. The idea to market to women was considered revolutionary by the hotel industry. Trend forecasters such as Faith Popcorn and Tom Peters cited Wyndham and the Women On Their Way program as being way ahead of the competition in knowing how to market to women travelers: and. [...] The program has evolved in recent years, as the growth of the female business traveler demographic has necessitated changes across the entire hospitality industry. Wyndham has noted that the more common presence in hotel rooms of items such as ironing boards, hair dryers, and coffee makers since the 1990s stems from hotel companies' responses to women customers' demands. Wyndham executives have explained that the company's emphasis on marketing to female business travelers is a response to the fact that women now tend to be the <b>primary</b> <b>selectors</b> of hotels. Since Wyndham began the Women on Their Way program, the proportion of their customers that are women has doubled, with women now representing half their customer base.|$|R
5000|$|Both {{the first}} mass {{analyzer}} and the collision cell are continuously exposed to ions from the source, {{in a time}} independent manner. It is once the ions move into the third mass analyzer that time dependence becomes a factor. The first quadrupole mass filter, Q1, is the <b>primary</b> m/z <b>selector</b> after the sample leaves the ionization source. Any ions with mass-to-charge ratios {{other than the one}} selected for {{will not be allowed to}} infiltrate Q1. The collision cell, denoted as [...] "q", is located between Q1 and Q3, is where fragmentation of the sample occurs in the presence of an inert gas like Ar, He, or N2. A characteristic daughter ion is produced as a result of the collisions of the inert gas with the analyte. Upon exiting the collision cell, the fragmented ions then travel onto the second quadrupole mass filter, Q3, where m/z selection can occur again.|$|R
