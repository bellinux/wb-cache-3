40|$|Self-Propagating High-Temperature Synthesis (SHS), {{also called}} {{combustion}} synthesis is an exothermic and self-sustained reaction between the constituents, which has assumed {{significance for the}} production of ceramics and ceramic-metallic materials (cermets), because it is a very rapid processing technique without the need of complex furnaces. However, one of the drawbacks of this route is the high porosity of the final product (typically 50 %). This implies the need for a subsequent densification stage, e. g. by pressing. Combustion synthesized cermets such as TiC-based graded or TiB 2 based cermets can provide a good option for the fabrication of functionally graded material (FGM) components, e. g. to be used in armor applications (TiC based cermets) or for high and medium voltage switchgears (TiB 2 -based cermets). Self sustained High- Temperature Reactions (SHR) involve the initiation, and the subsequent propagation of a reaction front, the reaction being driven by heat release. Heat release from these reactions is potentially interesting for high temperature welding and brazing operations.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{directed}} at the <b>pyrotechnic</b> time <b>delay</b> compositions {{that are used in}} detonator assemblies. The objectives were to: [...] Investigate effective alternatives for the barium and lead-based oxidants currently used, maintaining the use of silicon as fuel [...] Develop easy to use, realistic measurement techniques for burn rates and shock tube ignitability [...] Determine the variables that affect burn rate, and [...] Evaluate alternative processing routes to facilitate intimate mixing of the component powders. Lead chromate and copper antimonite were found to be suitable oxidants for silicon in time delay compositions. They were ignitable by shock tubing, a relatively weak ignition source. The measured burn speeds for these systems showed a bimodal dependence on stoichiometry. Measured burn rates varied between 6 - 28 mm/s. Lead chromate is potentially a suitable alternative to the oxidant currently used in the medium burn rate commercial composition. It burns faster than copper antimonite. The latter is potentially a suitable replacement oxidant for the slow and medium compositions. Antimony trioxide-based compositions exhibited unreliable performance with respect to ignition with shock tubing. The addition of aluminium powder or fumed silica was found to reduce the burn rate. Increasing the silicon particle size (m m) also decreased the burn speed for copper antimonite and lead chromate compositions. Addition of fumed silica improved the flow properties of the lead chromate, copper antimonite and antimony trioxide powders allowing for easier mixing. The silicon powder was found to react violently with water in alkaline solutions. This makes particle dispersion in a wet-mixing process problematic.

50|$|The M16 mine is a U.S.-made {{bounding}} anti-personnel mine. It {{was based}} on captured plans of the World War II era German S-mine and has similar performance. The mine consists of a cast iron body in a thin steel sleeve. A central fuze well {{on the top of}} the mine is normally fitted with a pronged M605 pressure and tilt fuze. Sufficient pressure on the prongs or tension on an attached tripwire causes the release of a striker. The freed striker is forced into a percussion cap which ignites a short <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>delay.</b> The purpose of this delay is to allow the victim to move off the top of the mine, to prevent its upward movement from being blocked. Once the delay has burned through, a 4.5-gram black powder charge is ignited, which launches the inner iron body of the mine up into the air (leaving behind the steel outer sleeve). The charge also ignites a second pair of pyrotechnic delays.|$|E
5000|$|A tilt-rod fuze is {{a device}} used to trigger anti-vehicle landmines.

When the track or main body of a vehicle passes over the mine, the rod is tilted, releasing a spring-loaded striker which triggers a <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>delay</b> of approximately half a second, followed by detonation of the main explosive charge. The small time delay allows the vehicle to continue over the mine before detonating, exposing more of it to the blast. A tilt-rod fuze has a number of advantages over pressure fuzes - it acts across the entire width of a vehicle, rather than just its tracks or tires. [...] This allows it to attack the vehicles belly and potentially cause a catastrophic kill. Additionally, tilt rod fuzes tend to be resistant to blast overpressure clearing methods, which can trigger most pressure fuzes.|$|E
50|$|When {{the weapon}} is fired, the {{rotating}} band engages the barrel rifling to impart spin to the projectile for stability in flight. The obturator and rotating band form a seal to prevent leakage of gas pressure past the projectile. The burning propellant accelerates the projectile through the barrel at high velocity. Extended range is obtained through rocket assist; the rocket cap is removed prior to placing the projectile in the chamber, exposing the <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>delay</b> assembly {{in the base}} of the rocket motor. When the projectile is fired, the propellant gases ignite the delay which burns for approximately 7 seconds and then sets off the rocket igniter to initiate the rocket motor, which burns for approximately three seconds. This additional thrust augments the velocity and consequently, the range of the projectile. If a PD or ET is used, the fuze detonates the supplementary charge and the supplementary charge detonates the warhead filler either on impact or the preset time.|$|E
40|$|Conventional <b>pyrotechnic</b> time <b>delays</b> {{are based}} on powder {{mixtures}} pressed into tubes of precise lengths. Pyrotechnics based on filled polymer systems may offer some advantages. This includes continuous manufacture via extrusion processes. Thermoplastic-based pyrotechnic compositions can be formulated by filling conventional polymer matrices with oxidants such as potassium nitrate. More interesting are fluoropolymer matrices as these strong oxidants enable the design of non-gassing systems with suitable fuels. The presence of fillers dramatically increases the melt viscosity. The random packed limit for monodisperse spherical particles corresponds to a volume fraction of 0. 637 (Krieger, 1959). Pyrotechnic compositions with oxidant filler volume fractions below this critical level are only viable for conventional polymers with very high C:H atomic ratios, e. g. polystyrene. Pyrotechnic compositions comprising of filled thermoplastics were simulated using EKVI thermodynamic software. This allowed for the calculation of the adiabatic flame temperatures, variation of the product composition and gas evolved with varied filler content. The EKVI thermodynamic simulations showed that polystyrene filled with potassium nitrate or potassium permanganate were unlikely to be viable as global maximum temperatures were not achieved below 78 vol. %. A fully fluorinated polymer filled with aluminium, magnesium, magnalium and calcium carbide were shown to be viable between 20 wt. % and 70 wt. % reducing agent. Co-polymers of tetrafluoroethylene and vinylidene fluoride filled with aluminium or magnesium showed similar adiabatic temperatures as compositions based on perfluorinated polymers with the same reducing agents. The energy required to decompose the thermoplastic binder would, however, lower {{the amount of energy}} available for the pyrotechnic reaction. Open flame burn test showed that the polystyrene-based compositions did not generate enough energy to decompose the thermoplastic fraction to sustain chemical reaction. Viton B filled with calcium carbide could not sustain burning. Compositions using aluminium and magnalium with Viton B as oxidant sustained burning over the range 20 wt. % to 60 wt. %. The effect of morphology was tested by using two grades of aluminium; atomized aluminium, and flake-like aluminium particles. Energy measurements of Viton B filled with aluminium and magnalium indicated that the maximum energy output occurred in the range 30 wt. % to 40 wt. % fuel for aluminium-based compositions and between 40 wt. % and 50 wt. % for magnalium-based compositions. A maximum burn rate of 82 mm s 1 was achieved using a magnalium/Viton B composition. Friction and impact test showed that the compositions are insensitive. XRD analysis of the combustion residue of Viton B-based compositions using aluminium as fuel showed that the most abundant products formed were Al 4 C 3, AlF 3, carbon and an amorphous phase. An elemental balance indicated that the amorphous phase consisted of carbon, aluminium and fluorine. The XRD spectra of the residues of magnalium-based compositions had unidentified reflections. Quantitative XRD was, therefore, not possible on the reaction products of the magnalium-based compositions. TGA analysis on the combustion residue indicated that the combustion residue contained unreacted reagents. Scanning electron microscopy of the reaction residue revealed the presence of agglomerated cubic particles. EDX analysis indicated that the cubic particles consisted of aluminium and fluorine.

40|$|Silicon dispersions {{in water}} {{are used to}} produce <b>pyrotechnic</b> time <b>delay</b> {{compositions}} employed in mine detonators. The delay elements are manufactured by pressing the pyrotechnic composition into aluminium tubes. The automated filling and pressing process requires powders with good free-flow behaviour. Spray drying of water-based slurries is an appropriate method for obtaining such free-flowing granules as it creates almost perfectly spherical particle agglomerates. In addition to the acceptable flow properties, this process provides well-mixed compositions at desired particle size distributions. However, a potential hazard situation arises when water reacts dissociatively with silicon to form SiO 2 and hydrogen gas according to Si + 2 H 2 O _ SiO 2 + 2 H 2 ↑. The propensity of the silicon to react with water and to release hazardous hydrogen gas must thus be suppressed. To this end, the following methods were investigated {{as a means of}} diminishing the rate of hydrogen evolution: (i) controlling the slurry pH; (ii) adding organic corrosion inhibitors; (iii) controlled silicon air oxidation before slurrying; and (iv) adding suitable metal ions to provide an additional cathodic reaction to that of water. The effect of organic surface modifications and medium pH on the rate of corrosion of silicon was studied at ambient temperature. It was found that the rate of hydrogen evolution increased with increasing pH. Silanes proved to be more effective silicon corrosion inhibitors than alcohols, with vinyl tris(2 -methoxyethoxy) silane producing the best results from the silanes investigated. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) studies were performed using a near-stoichiometric amount of lead chromate as oxidant. Comparable combustion behaviour was observed when both the fuel and the oxidant powders were either uncoated or silane modified. Mixtures of neat oxidant with silane-coated silicon showed poor burn behaviour and this was attributed to poor particle- particle mixing due to the mismatch in surface energies. The controlled silicon air oxidation results showed that the best hydrogen evolution inhibition was attained upon formation of a SiO 2 passivating layer at 350 °C. However, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) data also suggest that some inhibition was imparted below 350 °C and this is due mainly to the removal of silicon surface hydroxyl groups rather than an increase in the SiO 2 thickness. DTA studies performed using a nearstoichiometric amount of lead chromate revealed that although heat treatment at higher temperatures provides better passivation; it reduces the reactivity of the silicon in pyrotechnic compositions. The ignition temperature increases while the energy output decreases. Water oxidises silicon via an electrochemical reaction that produces hydrogen gas. The last approach considered in this study was the introduction of a competing cathodic reaction as a means of suppressing the liberation of hydrogen. It was found that the addition of metal ions with a higher reduction potential than hydrogen ions, e. g. copper (II) ions, reduced the amount of hydrogen liberated. In the presence of copper ions the reaction with water featured three distinct stages. During the initial stage, copper is deposited on the silicon and a rapid drop in solution pH is observed. Most of the hydrogen evolved during a second active stage, with the pH showing a slight upward drift. Finally, in the third stage, hydrogen evolution stopped as the silicon surface became passive. The reduction in the total hydrogen evolved was attributed to copper deposits reducing the active surface area available for the oxidation of silicon and to the presence of copper which facilitates accelerated passivation of the uncoated silicon surface. The nature of the anions present affected both the amount of copper deposited on the silicon and the amount of hydrogen released. DTA studies showed that exposure of silicon to copper metal salt solutions also decreases the reactivity of the silicon fuel in pyrotechnic compositions.

50|$|Their high {{reliability}} and low cost make them very popular {{for use in}} weapons. A typical example is using shear pins in an explosive device. A shear pin can here hold a striker pin in place, preventing the striker pin from striking an initiator (primer) unless the correct force is applied. That force can be the acceleration of a rifle grenade being launched. The force would snap the shear pin, allowing the striker pin to move backwards onto a primer, which in turn ignites a <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>delay</b> composition for auto destruction. In this use shear pins prevent the striker pin from hitting the primer during handling or if the grenade was dropped by accident. Additionally, shear-pins are frequently used in anti-tank mine fuzes, {{to prevent them from}} being triggered by much lighter, non-target vehicles such as motorcycles.

Slow-burning Si-BaSO 4 <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>delay</b> compositions are employed for long time delays. However, soluble barium compounds may pose environmental and health risks. Hence {{it is necessary to}} consider replacing the barium sulfate with an alternative green oxidant that has similar burn properties. Anhydrous calcium sulfate was identified as a suitable, inexpensive alternative green oxidant. The initial part of the investigation focused on characterising the burn properties of the Si-CaSO 4, as well as proposing a viable reaction mechanism for this composition. Thermochemical calculations indicated that stoichiometry corresponds to a composition that contains ca. 30 wt. % silicon (Si). Combustion was only supported in the range 30 70 wt. % Si. In this range the bomb calorimeter data and burn tests indicate that the reaction rate and energy output decrease with increasing silicon content. The compositions were filled into rigid aluminium elements and assembled into full detonators. Burn rates ranged from 6. 9 to 12. 5 mm s? 1. The reaction product was a complex mixture that contained crystalline phases in addition to an amorphous calcium silicate phase. A reaction mechanism consistent with these observations is proposed. Slow-burning Si-BaSO 4 <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>delay</b> compositions are employed commercially for intermediate to long time delays. However, there is very little information on this composition available in the open literature. The reactivity of this composition was therefore characterised and compared with that of Si-CaSO 4. The Si-BaSO 4 composition supported combustion in the range of 20 to 60 wt. % Si in the bomb calorimeter. However, burning was only sustained between 20 and 40 wt. % Si in rigid aluminium tubes. The burn rates varied between 8. 4 and 16 mm s? 1. These values are comparable to those for the Si-CaSO 4 system (6. 9 12. 5 mm s? 1). However, the CaSO 4 -based formulations tended to have a higher energy output and produced a more pronounced transient pressure response than the barium sulfate compositions. Both the calcium sulfate- and barium sulfate-based formulations were insensitive to impact, friction and electrostatic discharge stimuli. The reaction products were a complex mixture that contained crystalline phases in addition to an amorphous phase. Although barium sulfate is insoluble in water and decidedly non-toxic, the reaction products produced by the Si-BaSO 4 compositions were found to contain water-soluble barium compounds. This ranged from 50 to 140 mg Ba per gram of barium sulfate reacted. The burn rates of delay compositions used in detonators can be modified by varying a range of parameters in addition to the stoichiometry. With this in mind, the effect of additives and fuel particle size distribution on the burn rate of the silicon-calcium sulfate <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>delay</b> compositions was investigated. The burn rate decreased with increase in fuel particle size, while the enthalpy remained constant. The addition of fuels to a base composition of 30 wt. % Si-CaSO 4 increased the burn rate, with an increase from 12. 5 mm s- 1 to 43 mm s- 1 being recorded on the addition of 10 wt. % Al. Ternary mixtures of silicon, calcium sulfate and an additional oxidiser generally decreased the burn rate. The exception was bismuth trioxide which increased it. The Si-CaSO 4 formulation was found {{to be sensitive to the}} presence of inert material as the addition of as little as 1 wt. % of fumed silica stifled combustion in the aluminium tubes.

However, the CaSO 4 based formulations tended to have higher energy output and produced more transient pressure compared to the barium sulfate compositions. Both formulations were insensitive to impact, friction and electrostatic discharge stimuli. The reaction products were a complex mixture that contained crystalline phases in addition to an amorphous phase. Although barium sulfate is insoluble in water and decidedly non-toxic, the reaction products produced by the Si-BaSO 4 compositions were found to release soluble barium ions when contacted with water. This ranged from 50 to 140 mg per gram of barium sulfate reacted. AEL Mining Service. National Research Foundation of South Africa (Grant 83874). [URL] Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Pyrotechnic delays {{are used}} to provide {{reproducible}} time intervals between energetic events. The simplicity and low cost of these “chemical timers ” make them advantageous for inexpensive munitions such as hand grenades and signaling devices. For example, U. S. Army hand-held signals (HHS) use a <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>delay</b> element to properly time the expulsion of illumination or smoke payloads once the rockets reach their apex. These items and other munitions use delay compositions containing chromates, perchlorates, and heavy metals. Over the last three years, our division has been working to develop environmentally benign replacement compositions {{for use in the}} U. S. Army hand-held signal. The large thermal mass of the HHS delay housing, combined with the long burning time requirement and short burning path, made it particularly difficult to develop suitable replacements. Many candidate compositions either burned too quickly or were quenched in this high heat loss environment. However, some of these systems, such as Si/Bi 2 O 3 /Sb 2 O 3 and Ti/C- 3 Ni/Al may be suitable for other applications including grenade fuzes. Ultimately, two systems were found to meet the HHS delay time requirement (5 - 6 s, 7 - 8. 5 s/cm). The first, W/Sb 2 O 3 /KIO 4 /calcium stearate, was shown to operate across a wide range of inverse burning rates, 2 - 15 s/cm. The second system, B 4 C/NaIO 4 /PTFE, proved even more versatil...|$|E
40|$|In {{industry}} {{the effective}} mixing and de-agglomeration of two solid particles is vital in applications {{that require the}} intimate contact of homogeneously mixed reagents. One such application is {{in the preparation of}} <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>delay</b> elements with reproducible burn speeds. The concept of surfactant assisted particle micro-mixing is proposed. This theory is based in the use of two amphiphilic polymeric surfactants to form two separate stable dispersions of the two solid particles to be mixed, but with the subsequent requirement that the dispersants are able to interact with each other. The formation of the individual dispersions allows for the deagglomeration of the particles and thus their preparation for homogeneous mixing, which is facilitated by the interacting surfactants. Low molecular mass block copolymers of styrene and acrylic acid and poly(ethylene oxide) -poly(propylene oxide) (PEO-PPO) surfactants are the proposed dispersants which will allow for the surfactant interaction by means of hydrogen bonding between the poly(acrylic acid) block and the PEO. The poly(styrene-co-acrylic acid) block copolymer will be synthesised via Atom Transfer Radical Polymerisation (ATRP) and subsequently used in the dispersion experiments. The synthesis of the polystyrene macroinitiators to initiate the block copolymerisation of the t-butyl acrylate was carried out satisfactorily, with good molecular masses and molecular mass distributions. In addition, lH-NMR analysis carried out on the polystyrene macroinitiators confirmed their synthesis. The use of the polystyrene macroinitiators was successful in synthesising poly(styrene-co-t-butyl acrylate) block copolymers with slightly higher polydispersities in comparison to the macroinitiatiators themselves, but acceptable. Hydrolysis of the poly(styrene-co-t-butyl acrylate) block copolymer to poly(styrene-co-acrylic acid) was successful in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid as catalyst. Attempts to hydrolyse in basic conditions (NaOH) and alternatively in acidic conditions (HCI) were not successful. Use of the poly(styrene-co-acrylic acid) amphiphilic block copolymer to emulsion polymerise styrene requires the ionised form of the polymer and was therefore not favourable to observe surfactant-surfactant hydrogen bonding. In addition, attempts to synthesise a wax emulsion stabilised by a PEO containing surfactant proved to be unsuccessful. Subsequently, the micro-mixing experiments were carried out by using a poly(acrylic acid) stabilised melamine dispersion and a commercially available PEO containing surfactant stabilised wax emulsion. The interaction between the melamine and the poly(acrylic acid) allows for the formation of a stable melamine dispersion at above 7 % poly(acrylic acid) : melamine ratio (mass basis). Analysis by SEM shows that without the poly(acrylic acid) dispersant no wax particles are found to occur on the melamine particle surface. However, in an attempt to determine whether the amount of wax interaction increases with poly(acrylic acid) content, it was found that in the absence of poly(acrylic acid) dispersant, the most amount of wax precipitated out with the melamine. This is possibly attributable to the preferential occlusion of the wax particles between the melamine particles rather than surface attachment. Introduction of the poly(acrylic acid), however, shows via SEM analysis that the hydrogen bond interaction between the acrylic acid group and the ethylene oxide group does occur, since the attachment of the wax particles on the melamine particle surface is observed. Although results show that the surfactant-surfactant interaction allows for the micro¬mixing of particles, some refinement is required with respect to the systems that this phenomenon can be applied to. In addition, factors such as particle type, particle size and surfactant type will influence the micro-mixing interaction. It is therefore recommended that these factors be investigated in order to completely identify the micro-mixing phenomenon.
