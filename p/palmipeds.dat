40|$|Our main {{objectives}} were {{to determine the}} genes involved {{in the establishment of}} hepatic steatosis in three genotypes of <b>palmipeds.</b> To respond to this question, we have compared Muscovy ducks, Pekin ducks and their crossbreed the mule duck fed ad libitum or overfed. We have shown a hepatic overexpression of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and di-acyl glycerol acyl transferase 2 (DGAT 2) in overfed individuals, where DGAT 2 seemed to be more regulated. This increase in lipogenesis genes is associated with a decrease of lipoprotein formation in Muscovy and mule ducks, especially apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and Microsomal Triglyceride Transfer Protein (MTTP), leading to lipid accumulation in liver. In Pekin ducks, MTTP expression is upregulated suggesting a better hepatic lipids exportation. Regarding lipids re-uptake, fatty acid-binding protein 4 and very-low-density-lipoprotein receptor are overexpressed in liver of mule ducks at the end of theoverfeeding period. This phenomenon puts light on a mechanism unknown until today. In fact, mule can incorporatemore lipids in liver than the two other genotypes leading to an intensified hepatic steatosis. To conclude, our results confirmed the genotype variability to overfeeding. Furthermore, similar observations are already described in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in human, and ask if ducks could be an animal model to study hepatic triglyceride accumulation...|$|E
40|$|Steatosis, the {{accumulation}} of triglycerides in hepatic cells after a rich in carbohydrate force-feeding, is a non pathological condition in <b>palmipeds.</b> The steatotic liver presents an enhanced metabolism. Protease activity in duck liver cells with steatosis was electrophoretically characterized. From exemplars of lean and fatty duck liver, three different homogenates were prepared: a plain homogenate, a metalloprotease extract and a cathepsin extract. The {{purpose of the study}} was to introduce a one-dimensional zymography (1 DZ) and two-dimensional zymography (2 DZ) approach in order to characterize the proteolytic profile present in hepatic cells under steatosis, with the ultimate goal to demonstrate the feasibility of this technique in determining proteolytic activity present in fatty liver in a semi-quantitative way. Protein concentration was 30 % higher in fatty liver extracts. Employing casein as substrate, proteolytic activity measured at 280 nm was determined to be 25 % higher in fatty liver extracts. Zymographic techniques allowed semi-quantitative results, successfully detecting cathepsin-and metalloprotease-activity using polyacrylamide gels copolymerized with gelatin and quantified by densitometry. The use of inhibitors confirmed the identity of the proteins studied. A metalloprotease activity was determined to have a relative molecular mass (M-r) similar to 90 +/- 5 kDa, with an isoelectric point (pI) of 5. 55 +/- 0. 01, and a cathepsin activity of 38 +/- 2 kDa with a pI of 4. 40 +/- 0. 01. The results confirm an increase in these protease activities present in extracts from steatotic livers. The analysis of liver proteases activities in force-fed ducks may elucidate the mechanisms behind steatosis development...|$|E
40|$|Newcastle disease (ND) and avian {{influenza}} (AI) are issues {{of interest to}} avian producers in Madagascar. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is the major constraint for village aviculture, and {{avian influenza}} viruses type A (AIAV) are known to circulate in bird flocks. This study aims at classifying smallholder poultry farms, according to the combination of risk factors potentially associated with NDV and AIAV transmission and to assess the level of infection for each farm class. Two study sites, Lake Alaotra and Grand Antananarivo, were chosen {{with respect to their}} differences in terms of agro-ecological features and poultry productions. A typology survey involving 526 farms was performed to identify possible risk factors for (i) within-village, and (ii) between-village virus transmission. A cross-sectional serological study was also carried out in 270 farms to assess sero-prevalences of NDV and AIAV for each farm class and the link between them and risk factor patterns. For within-village transmission, four classes of farms were identified in Grand Antananarivo and five in Lake Alaotra. For between-village virus transmission, four classes of farms were identified for each site. In both sites, NDV sero-prevalence was higher than for AIAV. There was no evidence of the presence of H 5 or H 7 subtypes of AIAV. Sero-prevalences were significantly higher in Lake Alaotra than in Grand Antananarivo for both viruses (OR = 2. 4, p = 0. 02 for NDV, and OR = 9. 6, p < 0. 0001 for AIAV). For within-village NDV transmission in Grand Antananarivo, backyard chicken farms (OR = 3. 6, p < 0. 001), and chicken farms with biosecurity awareness (OR = 3. 4, p < 0. 01) had greater odds of having antibodies against NDV than the others. For between-village virus transmission, farms with multiple external contacts, and farms using many small markets had greater odds of having antibodies against NDV than the others (OR = 5. 4, p < 0. 01). For AIAV, there were no differences in sero-prevalences among farm classes. In Lake Alaotra, the observed high density of <b>palmipeds</b> and widespread rice paddies were associated with high sero-prevalences for both viruses, and a homogeneous risk of virus transmission between the different farm classes. In Grand Antananarivo, farm visits by collectors or animal health workers, and farm contacts with several markets were identified as potential risk factors for NDV transmission. Further studies are needed to identify the circulating virus genotypes, model their transmission risk, and provide adapted control measures. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
