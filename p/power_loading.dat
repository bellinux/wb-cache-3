2500|$|The {{powerful}} 10mm Auto cartridge, {{which had}} been suffering from poor acceptance from its start in the early 1980s, was eventually accepted by the FBI in a reduced power, subsonic loading. Smith & Wesson then decided the 10mm Auto was too much cartridge for the reduced <b>power</b> <b>loading,</b> and that the [...]45 ACP sized guns that chambered it were too heavy and bulky; out of this came the [...]40 S, a shortened 10mm Auto case, designed to fit in a 9mm-sized gun, with a reduced pressure loading that allowed a lighter, easier to shoot gun. Because most ammunition manufacturers backed the [...]40 S, there was little use for the very similar [...]41 AE, so production of both firearms and ammunition was soon phased out.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with most}} other US destroyers of this period, the 5 inch guns {{featured}} all-angle <b>power</b> <b>loading</b> and were director controlled, making them {{as effective as}} the technology allowed against aircraft. By late 1942, radio proximity fuses (VT fuses) made them much more effective. As in the last two Maurys, the two forward 5 inch guns were in enclosed mounts, while the after guns were open. However, in common with all US surface combatants in the 1930s, the light AA armament was weak; only four [...]50 caliber machine guns (12.7mm) were equipped. It was apparently felt that the heavy AA armament would shoot down most incoming aircraft in all situations, but the attack on Pearl Harbor showed that this was not true. The Gridleys' weak AA armament was partially remedied after Pearl Harbor by replacing the machine guns with seven 20 mm Oerlikon cannon (0.8in). The Gridleys were alone among the 1930s and 1940s destroyers in not receiving any 40 mm Bofors guns (1.6in) due to stability concerns. Most of these destroyers had some or all torpedo tubes replaced by light AA guns during World War II, but not the Gridleys.|$|E

Taking the characteristics of randomness, tendency, and periodicity of short-term <b>power</b> <b>load</b> into account, a new method (SSA-AR model) which combines the univariate singular spectrum analysis and autoregressive model is proposed. Firstly, the singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is employed to decompose and reconstruct the original <b>power</b> <b>load</b> series. Secondly, the autoregressive (AR) model is used to forecast based on the reconstructed <b>power</b> <b>load</b> series. The employed data is the hourly <b>power</b> <b>load</b> series of the Mid-Atlantic region in PJM electricity market. Empirical analysis result shows that, compared with the single autoregressive model (AR), SSA-based linear recurrent method (SSA-LRF), and BPNN (backpropagation neural network) model, the proposed SSA-AR method has a better performance in terms of short-term <b>power</b> <b>load</b> forecasting...|$|R

Aiming at locating these issues of <b>power</b> <b>load</b> forecasting, an innovative hybrid method is proposed to forecast <b>power</b> <b>load</b> in this paper. Firstly, ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is used to decompose the <b>power</b> <b>load</b> series {{into a series of}} independent intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and a residual term. Secondly, genetic algorithm (GA) is then applied to determine the best weights of each IMF and the residual term named ensemble empirical mode decomposition based on weight (WEEMD). Thirdly, least square support vector machine (LSSVM) and nonparametric generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (NPGARCH) are employed to forecast the subseries, respectively, based on the characteristics of <b>power</b> <b>load</b> series. Finally, the forecasted <b>power</b> <b>load</b> of each component is summed as the final forecasted result of <b>power</b> <b>load.</b> Compared with other methods, the forecasting results of this proposed model applied to the electricity market of Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) indicate that the proposed model outperforms other models...|$|R

The composite airframe was based on the Giles G-202 design, with an empty weight of 1,600 pounds (725 kg).

5000|$|Catastrophic failure {{can occur}} from two {{separate}} mechanisms: energy and heat. When too much energy {{is used for}} the pulse duration, structural failure of the glass envelope can occur. Flashtubes produce an electrical arc flash contained in a glass tube. As the arc develops, a supersonic shock-wave forms, traveling radially {{from the center of the}} arc and impacting the inner wall of the tube. If the energy level is low enough, a tap against the glass is all that will be heard. However, if the energy level used equals the [...] "explosion energy" [...] rating of the lamp, the impacting shock wave will fracture the glass, rupturing the tube. The resulting explosion creates a loud, sonic shock-wave, and may throw shattered glass several feet. The explosion energy is calculated by multiplying the internal surface-area of the lamp, between the electrodes, with the power-loading capacity of the glass. <b>Power</b> <b>loading</b> is determined by the type and thickness of the glass, and the cooling method that is used. <b>Power</b> <b>loading</b> is measured in watts per centimeter squared.
