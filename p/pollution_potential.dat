Today, environmental agencies regulate the trace limits of DBPs in drinking water. Recently published analytical methods, such as United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) method 415.3, support the Agency's Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproducts Rules, which regulate the amount of NOM to prevent the formation of DBPs in finished waters.|$|E
50|$|Reservoirs may {{contribute}} {{to changes in the}} Earth's climate. Warm climate reservoirs generate methane, a greenhouse gas when the reservoirs are stratified, in which the bottom layers are anoxic (i.e. they lack oxygen), leading to degradation of biomass through anaerobic processes. At a dam in Brazil, where the flooded basin is wide and the biomass volume is high the methane produced results in a <b>pollution</b> <b>potential</b> 3.5 times more than an oil-fired power plant would be. A theoretical study has indicated that globally hydroelectric reservoirs may emit 104 million metric tonnes of methane gas annually. Methane gas is a significant contributor to global climate change.|$|E

40|$|Agricultural {{nonpoint source}} (NPS) {{pollution}} {{has been the}} most important threat to water environment quality. Understanding the spatial distribution of NPS <b>pollution</b> <b>potential</b> risk is important for taking effective measures to control and reduce NPS pollution. A Transformed-Agricultural Nonpoint <b>Pollution</b> <b>Potential</b> Index (T-APPI) model was constructed for evaluating the national NPS <b>pollution</b> <b>potential</b> risk in this study; it was also combined with remote sensing and geographic information system techniques for evaluation on the large scale and at 1 km(2) spatial resolution. This model considers many factors contributing to the NPS pollution as the original APPI model, summarized as four indicators of the runoff, sediment production, chemical use and the people and animal load. These four indicators were analysed in detail at 1 km(2) spatial resolution throughout China. The T-APPI model distinguished the four indicators into pollution source factors and transport process factors; it also took their relationship into consideration. The studied results showed that T-APPI is a credible and convenient method for NPS <b>pollution</b> <b>potential</b> risk evaluation. The results also indicated that the highest NPS <b>pollution</b> <b>potential</b> risk is distributed in the middle-southern Jiangsu province. Several other regions, including the North China Plain, Chengdu Basin Plain, Jianghan Plain, cultivated lands in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, also showed serious NPS <b>pollution</b> <b>potential.</b> This study can provide a scientific reference for predicting the future NPS pollution risk throughout China and may be helpful for taking reasonable and effective measures for preventing and controlling NPS pollution...|$|E

Seven physical factors: depth to water, recharge, aquifer media, soil media, topography, impact of the vadose zone, and hydraulic conductivity, are evaluated using the DRASTIC system to determine the ground-water <b>pollution</b> <b>potential</b> of the study area.

For this reason, air pollution related issues and prevention approaches is an essential area of study more than ever in developing countries like Malaysia. Experimental air <b>pollution</b> <b>potential</b> forecasting study in Klang Valley-Malaysia during January to December 2009 is described and analysed. In this study, the effect of wind speed, rainfall, temperature and stability factor of the lower level of atmosphere on potential of air pollution are evaluated in which Joukoff and Malet (1982) model is used as an initial model. The above meteorological factors first are used to calculate meteorological air <b>pollution</b> <b>potential</b> (MPI). After that, MPIs vs meteorological factors are evaluated utilizing time analysis and linear regression. The results discourage the use of foresaid meteorological factor except for temperature for forecasting of air <b>pollution</b> <b>potential</b> in Malaysia and regions with the same climate characteristics.

40|$|Activity of {{xanthine}} oxidase, {{levels of}} lipid peroxidation and ascorbic acid were studied in African land snail (Achatina marginatus) from two sites with different <b>pollution</b> <b>potentials.</b> Lipid peroxidation {{was significantly higher}} in the snails from the polluted site compared to the value obtained from the same species from the control site.

Conversely, ascorbic acid content in the snails from the polluted site was significantly lower compared to the value obtained for the snails from the control site. The data presented here suggest that the upregulation of the activity of xanthine oxidase level of lipid peroxidation and the corresponding reduction in ascorbic acid content is related to oxidative stress in this species and could therefore possibly make it a bioindicator of environmental pollution...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{demonstrate}} the application of ecological risk assessment for Pollution Prevention (P 2). Thirteen textile industry auxiliary products were selected by their Material Safety Data Sheets – MSDS. The exposure and environmental behavior of substances were estimated by the softwares E-FAST and EPIWin, respectively, considering the following properties: bio-concentration potential (Kow and Bioconcentration Factor), soil absorption potential (Koc), biodegradability, and removal percentage after effluent treatment. The hazards to aquatic biota identified were the acute and chronic toxic effects to algae, aquatic invertebrates and fish, estimated through Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR), using the ECOSAR software. The ecological risk was determined considering the hazards and exposure of each substance, and demonstrated that three wetting agents and one dispersant have ecological risks in sufficient degree to justify their exclusion. The products evaluated presented low potentials for biota distribution (low Kow and bio-accumulation factor) and soil absorption (low Koc). The study demonstrates that ecological risk assessment is a low-cost, fast, and relatively reliable method for selecting products with lower <b>pollution</b> <b>potentials</b> that can be used by any industrial sector...|$|R

40|$|Using the {{knowledge}} of the regional groundwater conditions {{and the nature of the}} human activities and their possible impacts on groundwater quality provided by Sections I and II, this chapter describes the assessment of groundwater <b>pollution</b> <b>potential,</b> and illustrates the approach with two case studies.

40|$|Emissions {{from the}} {{combustion}} of biomass and fossil fuels {{are a significant}} source of particulate matter (PM) in ambient outdoor and/or indoor air. It is important to quantify PM emissions from combustion sources for regulatory and control purposes in relation to air quality. In this paper, we review emission factors for several types of important combustion sources: road transport, industrial facilities, small household combustion devices, environmental tobacco smoke, and vegetation burning. We also review current methods for measuring particle physical characteristics (mass and number concentrations) and principles of methodologies for measuring emission factors. The emission factors can be measured on a fuel-mass basis and/or a task basis. Fuel mass based emission factors (e. g., g per kg of fuel) can be readily used for the development of emission inventories when the amount of fuels consumed are known. Task-based emission factors (g per mile driven, g per MJ generated) are more appropriate when used to conduct comparisons of air <b>pollution</b> <b>potentials</b> of different combustion devices. Finally, we discuss major shortcomings and limitations of current methods for measuring particle emissions and present recommendations for development of future measurement techniques...|$|R
