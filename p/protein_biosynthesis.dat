5|$|Mitochondria {{have their}} own genetic material, and the {{machinery}} to manufacture their own RNAs and proteins (see: <b>protein</b> <b>biosynthesis).</b> A published human mitochondrial DNA sequence revealed 16,569base pairs encoding 37 genes: 22tRNA, 2 rRNA, and 13peptide genes. The 13 mitochondrial peptides in humans are integrated into the inner mitochondrial membrane, along with proteins encoded by genes that reside in the host cell's nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Approximately half of {{all known}} {{antibiotics}} interfere with the workings of a bacteria's ribosome, a large and complex biochemical machine that performs <b>protein</b> <b>biosynthesis</b> by translating messenger RNA into proteins. Macrolide antibiotics clog the ribosome's exit tunnel, preventing synthesis of essential bacterial proteins. In 2007, the Pande lab received a grant to study and design new antibiotics. In 2008, they used Folding@home to study the interior of this tunnel and how specific molecules may affect it. The full structure of the ribosome was determined only as of 2011, and Folding@home has also simulated ribosomal proteins, as many of their functions remain largely unknown.|$|E
5|$|During the infection, {{rotavirus}} produces mRNA {{for both}} <b>protein</b> <b>biosynthesis</b> and gene replication. Most of the rotavirus proteins accumulate in viroplasm, where the RNA is replicated and the DLPs are assembled. Viroplasm is formed around the cell nucleus {{as early as}} two hours after virus infection, and consists of viral factories thought {{to be made by}} two viral nonstructural proteins: NSP5 and NSP2. Inhibition of NSP5 by RNA interference results in a sharp decrease in rotavirus replication. The DLPs migrate to the endoplasmic reticulum where they obtain their third, outer layer (formed by VP7 and VP4). The progeny viruses are released from the cell by lysis.|$|E

5|$|In animals, {{amino acids}} are {{obtained}} through {{the consumption of}} foods containing protein. Ingested proteins are then broken down into amino acids through digestion, which typically involves denaturation of the protein through exposure to acid and hydrolysis by enzymes called proteases. Some ingested amino acids are used for <b>protein</b> <b>biosynthesis,</b> while others are converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis, or fed into the citric acid cycle. This use of protein as a fuel is particularly important under starvation conditions as it allows the body's own proteins {{to be used to}} support life, particularly those found in muscle.|$|E
5|$|The cytosol is {{the site}} of most {{metabolism}} in prokaryotes, and {{a large proportion of the}} metabolism of eukaryotes.

5|$|The two nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, are {{polymers}} of nucleotides. Each nucleotide {{is composed}} of a phosphate attached to a ribose or deoxyribose sugar group which {{is attached to a}} nitrogenous base. Nucleic acids are critical for the storage and use of genetic information, and its interpretation through the processes of transcription and <b>protein</b> <b>biosynthesis.</b> This information is protected by DNA repair mechanisms and propagated through DNA replication. Many viruses have an RNA genome, such as HIV, which uses reverse transcription to create a DNA template from its viral RNA genome. RNA in ribozymes such as spliceosomes and ribosomes is similar to enzymes as it can catalyze chemical reactions. Individual nucleosides are made by attaching a nucleobase to a ribose sugar. These bases are heterocyclic rings containing nitrogen, classified as purines or pyrimidines. Nucleotides also act as coenzymes in metabolic-group-transfer reactions.|$|E

Moreover, Chymotrypsin induces its own activation by cleaving in positions 14-15, 146-147 and 148-149, producing α-Chymotrypsin (which is more active and stable than π-Chymotrypsin).

Conversely, glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase enhancement - which also occurs during the aging of potato slices - depends on protein synthesis but does not require ascorbic acid.

2500|$|Transfer-messenger RNA (abbreviated tmRNA, {{also known}} as 10Sa RNA and by its genetic name SsrA) is a {{bacterial}} RNA molecule with dual tRNA-like and messenger RNA-like properties. The tmRNA forms a ribonucleoprotein complex (tmRNP) together with Small Protein B (SmpB), Elongation Factor Tu (EF-Tu), and ribosomal protein S1. In trans-translation, tmRNA and its associated proteins bind to bacterial ribosomes which have stalled {{in the middle of}} <b>protein</b> <b>biosynthesis,</b> for example when reaching the end of a messenger RNA which has lost its stop codon. The tmRNA is remarkably versatile: it recycles the stalled ribosome, adds a proteolysis-inducing tag to the unfinished polypeptide, and facilitates the degradation of the aberrant messenger RNA. In the majority of bacteria these functions are carried out by standard one-piece tmRNAs. In other bacterial species, a permuted ssrA gene produces a two-piece tmRNA in which two separate RNA chains are joined by base-pairing.|$|E
