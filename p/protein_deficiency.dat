In an interview, Pickett later said that Lancet editor Richard Horton must have had a political motive for publishing the paper because the referees had rejected it. According to Pusztai this claim was repeated by academic critics who assumed that Pickett's use of the plural suggested that the study had failed peer review.|$|E

Roughly, 44 million pregnant women are estimated to be infected.

40|$|Abstract <b>Protein</b> S <b>deficiency</b> is an {{autosomal}} dominant disorder {{that results from}} mutations in the protein S gene (PROS 1). Inherited <b>deficiency</b> of <b>protein</b> S constitutes {{a risk factor for}} venous thromboembolism. Protein S functions as a nonenzymatic cofactor for activated protein C in the proteolytic degradation of coagulation factors a and a. The frequency of <b>protein</b> S <b>deficiency</b> seems to differ between populations. More than 200 rare mutations in PROS 1 have been identified in patients with <b>protein</b> S <b>deficiency.</b> Among the prevalent mutations within PROS 1, the S 460 P substitution (known as Heerlen polymorphism) detected in Caucasians and the K 196 E substitution (known as protein S Tokushima) found in Japanese have been intensively studied for their structures and potential functions in the disorder of <b>protein</b> S <b>deficiency.</b> Until now, causative mutations in PROS 1 have been found in only approximately 50 % of cases with <b>protein</b> S <b>deficiency.</b> Co-segregation analysis of microsatellite haplotypes with <b>protein</b> S <b>deficiency</b> in families with <b>protein</b> S <b>deficiency</b> suggests that the causative defects in the PROS 1 mutation-negative patients are located in or close to the PROS 1 gene.
