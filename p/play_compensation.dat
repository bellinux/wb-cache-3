40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay {{is to examine the}} impact on {{children}} playing at a preschool yard that is designed with traditional playground equipment, and a nature-like yard without traditional playground equipment. How these respective environments influence children’s play, which other factors in the external environment that affect the game and whether the theories in the literature correspond with the results were important questions for the essay. To answer these questions a case study was applied onto two specific preschool centers, both located in Malmö. Through literature studies, inventories, observations and interviews with staff and children, a picture become clear of how the children use the yard and how their play is affected by the design of it. The use of several different methods within the case study purposed in providing a greater understanding and comprehensive picture of the outdoor environments impact on children's play. The results proved that the design of a yard largely affects the game and that different types of outdoor environments favor different types of activities. The results did largely agree with the theories that exist in literature. My conclusions are that children's play is greatly influenced by design, in which a yard containing traditional play equipment such as swings and slides stimulate various motoric training games. Exploring and creating could occur when using the sandbox. A nature-like yard containing much vegetation, natural materials and verdure is regarded as stimulating of imaginative and movement-oriented games, but also encourages exploration games. There are furthermore a number of other factors in the outside environment that effect children's play. Key discussion points for the essay concerns factors that could have affected the outcome of the result, the results consistency with research theories, tendencies towards so-called discursive <b>play,</b> <b>compensations</b> of a yards limitiations and whether a combination of a planned and nature-like environment can be assessed as the most optimal...|$|R

30|$|Germany {{provides}} a particularly interesting case study. Compared to the US, workers in Germany have longer job tenure (Farber 1998; Harhoff 1998). Moreover, upward-sloping earnings profiles appear {{to play an}} important role in Germany (OECD 2006; Zwick 2011). Furthermore, pensions voluntarily provided by the employers constitute one of the pillars (along with state pensions and individual savings) of the German retirement system (Schnabel and Wagner 1999). These employer provided pensions have been shown to reduce fluctuations in personnel (Rabe 2005; Schnabel and Wagner 2001) and to increase worker engagement (Bossler 2015). Finally, even though the age structure of the workforce may have little influence on productivity, a higher share of older workers appears to be associated with reduced profitability of German firms (Pfeifer and Wagner 2014 a). Altogether, these facts suggest that deferred <b>compensation</b> <b>plays</b> an important role in the functioning of the labor market for older workers in Germany.|$|R

This unfortunate situation reveals a significant (and obvious) gap between theory and practice. In this paper, we introduce a framework for the formal analysis of compensation operations, using an automated theorem prover. This framework includes: a high-level object-oriented schema definition language, an automated mapping from this language to a model in higher-order logic, and theorem prover extensions for mechanically reasoning about the database operations.

30|$|Overall, our {{findings}} in Table 4 suggest that, {{in both the}} short run (one year after spinoff) and the long run (three years after spinoff), {{there is a significant}} improvement in the association between the annual change in total CEO pay and market-based annual shareholder wealth creation.

This finding complements the spinoff value gain explanation advanced by Hite and Owers (1983) and Schipper and Smith (1983); both of these studies suggest that spinoff creates value by improving contracting efficiency. In addition, our empirical evidence supports the theoretical model from Aron (1991), suggesting that spinoff allows the firm to write and enforce performance-based incentive contracts in a less costly manner. From a broader perspective, our results are consistent with the view from a strand of spinoff studies (Seward and Walsh 1996; Burch and Nanda 2003; and Ahn and Walker 2007) which suggest that spinoff creates value by mitigating agency costs present in multi-divisional organizations.|$|R
