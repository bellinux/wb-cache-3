The Julianna company went bankrupt in 1888. The shareholders rescued the company and renamed it the Geyser Mining Company.

This stock contained isolates which were poorly motile and had no IS 1 element upstream of the flhD promoter. From these isolates, motile subpopulations were identified after extended incubation in motility agar. Purified motile derivatives contained an IS 5 element insertion upstream of the flhD promoter, and swarm rates were sevenfold higher than that of the original isolate. For a motile derivative, levels of flhD transcript had increased 2. 7 -fold, leading to a 32 -fold increase in fliA transcript and a 65 -fold increase in flhB::luxCDABE expression from a promoter probe vector. A collection of commonly used lab strains was screened for IS element insertion and motility. Five strains (RP 437, YK 410, MC 1000, W 3110, and W 2637) contained IS 5 elements upstream of the flhD promoter at either of two locations. This correlated with high swarm rates. Four other strains (W 1485, FB 8, MM 294, and RB 791) did not contain IS elements in the flhD regulatory region and were poorly motile. Primer extension determined that the transcriptional start site of flhD was unaltered by the IS element insertions. We suggest that IS element insertion may activate transcription of the flhD operon by reducing transcriptional repression...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Direct gene {{transfer}} into neurons has potential for developing gene therapy treatments for specific neurological conditions, and for elucidating neuronal physiology. Due {{to the complex}} cellular composition of specific brain areas, neuronal type-specific recombinant gene expression is required for many potential applications of neuronal {{gene transfer}}. One approach is to target gene transfer to {{a specific type of}} neuron. We developed modified Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV- 1) particles that contain chimeric glycoprotein C (gC) – glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) proteins. HSV- 1 vector particles containing either gC – GDNF or gC – BDNF target gene transfer to nigrostriatal neurons, which contain specific receptors for GDNF or BDNF. A second approach to achieve neuronal type-specific expression is to use a cell type-specific promoter, and we have used the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) promoter to restrict expression to catecholaminergic neurons or a modified neurofilament heavy gene promoter to restrict expression to neurons, and both of these promoters support long-term expression from HSV- 1 vectors. To both improve nigrostriatal-neuron specific expression, and to establish that targeted gene transfer can be followed by long-term expression, we performed targeted gene transfer with vectors that support long-term, neuronal-specific expression. Results Helper virus-free HSV- 1 vector packaging was performed using either gC – GDNF or gC – BDNF and vectors that contain either the TH promoter or the modified neurofilament heavy gene <b>promoter.</b> Vector <b>stocks</b> were injected into the midbrain proximal to the substantia nigra, and the rats were sacrificed at either 4 days or 1 month after gene transfer. Immunofluorescent costaining was performed to detect both recombinant gene products and nigrostriatal neurons. The combination of targeted gene transfer with neuronal-specific promoters improved nigrostriatal neuron-specific expression (83 to 93 %) compared to either approach alone, and supported long-term (1 month) expression at levels similar to those observed using untargeted gene transfer. Conclusion Targeted gene transfer can be used in combination with neuronal-specific promoters to achieve a high level of nigrostriatal neuron-specific expression. Targeted gene transfer can be followed by long-term expression. Nigrostriatal neuron-specific expression may be useful for specific gene therapy approaches to Parkinson's disease or for genetic analyses of nigrostriatal neuron physiology. </p...|$|R
