25|$|One {{insight into}} the {{reaction}} mechanism for this <b>photoreaction</b> is given by an isotope scrambling experiment. The 6 vinylic protons in barrelene 1 are more acidic than the two bridgehead protons and therefore they can be replaced by deuterium with N-deuteriocyclohexylamide. Photolysis of 2 results in the initial formation of an biradical intermediate with a cyclopropane ring formed. This product rearranges to a second intermediate with a more favorable allylic radical as two mesomers. Intersystem crossing and radical recombination results in equal quantities of semibullvalenes 3 and 4. The new proton distribution with allylic, vinylic and cyclopropanyl protons determined with proton NMR confirms this model. As noted, the conversion of barrelene to semibullvalene is a di-pi-methane rearrangement.|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of <b>photoreactions</b> {{reported in the}} literature rely on wavelengths within the UV and—to a lesser extent—visible regime for activation, either by directly triggering the reaction or by photocatalysis. However, <b>photoreactions</b> induced by near-infrared (NIR) light are highly attractive for biomedical applications as NIR light can penetrate deeper into tissue and causes less damage to photosensitive biological systems. Recently, upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) have been employed by us and others to assist NIR photoinduced reactions. UCNPs convert NIR light to UV or visible light, which can trigger <b>photoreactions</b> of conventional UV or visible-light-sensitive compounds. In the current Concept article, we introduce the fundamentals of UCNP-assisted photochemistry and highlight selected future applications and innovative potential for the field...|$|R

In {{view of the}} similarity of all {{absorption spectra}} {{it is suggested that}} the lowest energy transitions are largely of the intraligand type. The photolysis of these complexes in acetonitrile leads to substitutions of SnCl 3 − {{or in the case of}} [Ru(SnCl 3) 6] 4 − to a ligand fragmentation as primary <b>photoreactions.</b> Owing to secondary processes [M(snCl 3) 4 (AN) 2] 2 − is the terminal product of all the <b>photoreactions.</b> It is assumed that the <b>photoreactions</b> are initiated by intraligand excitation...|$|R

40|$|The [2 + 2] photocycloaddition is a {{powerful}} but underused synthetic route to cyclobutanes.

Lithium borohydride was demonstrated as a successful trapping agent in intramolecular [2 + 2] enone-olefin photocycloadditions.

40|$|Light {{processing}} is nowadays recognised as {{an efficient}} technology to non-thermally inactivate {{a wide range}} of microorganisms to increase food safety. However, exposure of foods to light can provide further advantages associated with the development of <b>photoreactions</b> involving polymers. Proteins are major target polymers for <b>photoreactions</b> due to abundance of endogenous chromophores, ability to bind exogenous ones and rapid reactivity with other excited state species. As food structure and functions are the result of the status of food constituents, photo-induced structural modification of food proteins can lead to new product characteristics or improved functionalities.

40|$|<b>Photoreactions</b> of N-(2, 4 -dibromonaphthyl) arenecarboxamides {{in basic}} medium {{result in the}} {{intramolecular}} substituted products, 2 -aryl- 8 -bromonaphthoxazoles in moderate yields and further <b>photoreactions</b> of the products afford the reduced products, 2 -arylnaphthoxazoles.

50|$|In chemistry, {{photocatalysis}} is {{the acceleration}} of a <b>photoreaction</b> {{in the presence of}} a catalyst. In catalysed photolysis, light is absorbed by an adsorbed substrate. In photogenerated catalysis, the photocatalytic activity (PCA) depends on the ability of the catalyst to create electron-hole pairs, which generate free radicals (e.g. hydroxyl radicals: •OH) able to undergo secondary reactions. Its practical application was made possible by the discovery of water electrolysis by means of titanium dioxide.|$|E
40|$|At {{least two}} <b>photoreactions</b> can be {{demonstrated}} in plant developmental responses: the low-energy requiring phytochrome system and the high energy reaction. The action of these <b>photoreactions</b> on the formation of anthocyanin by turnip seedlings is discussed. The synthesis of small amounts of anthocyanin can be controlled solely by phytochrome, {{as evidenced by the}} red-far-red photoreversible effect of brief irradiations. Appreciable synthesis requires prolonged irradiations, the duration of irradiation being more important than intensity. The data presented suggest that the energy dependence of anthocyanin synthesis arises through photosynthesis. A mechanism for the interaction between photosynthesis and phytochrome is suggested. Under conditions of natural illumination of plants, the concentration of the species of phytochrome that absorbs far-red light may be lower than previously realized...|$|R
50|$|The {{process by}} which a photon initiates a {{chemical}} reaction directly is known as photolysis; if this process is aided by a catalyst, it is called photocatalysis. If a photon has more energy than a material's characteristic band gap, it can free an electron upon absorption by the material. The remaining, positively charged hole and the free electron may recombine, generating heat, or they can take part in <b>photoreactions</b> with nearby species. If the <b>photoreactions</b> with these species result in regeneration of the electron-donating material—i.e., if the material acts {{as a catalyst for}} the reactions—then the reactions are deemed photocatalytic. PECO represents a type of photocatalysis whereby semiconductor-based electrochemistry catalyzes an oxidation reaction—for example, the oxidative degradation of an airborne contaminant in air purification systems.|$|R

50|$|Michler’s ketone is {{commonly}} used as an additive in dyes and pigments as a sensitizer for photoreactions because of its absorption properties. Michler’s ketone is an effective sensitizer provided energy transfer is exothermic and the concentration of the acceptor is sufficiently high to quench the <b>photoreaction</b> of Michler’s ketone with itself. Specifically Michler’s ketone absorbs intensely at 366 nm and effectively sensitizes photochemical reactions such as the dimerization of butadiene to give 1,2-divinylcyclobutane.|$|E

Specifically we compute inclusive π^+ photoproduction from deuterium for photon energies less than 200 MeV using a Yamaguchi model for the NN interaction. It is demonstrated that although the response functions for inclusive meson production do not have favourable asymptotic behavior one can nontheless extract them by inversion of the transform. The implication is that one can treat realistic problems of photo-meson production including all final state interactions by means of the LIT technique.

50|$|Self-focus {{was also}} {{observed}} in photo-polymer systems, which demonstrated {{the ability to}} self-focus microscale laser beams of either UV or visible light. The self-trapping of incoherent light was also later observed. Self-focusing can also be observed in wide-area beams, wherein the beam undergoes filamentation, or Modulation Instability, spontaneous dividing into a multitude of microscale self-focused beams, or filaments. The balance of self-focusing and natural beam divergence results in the beams propagating divergence-free. Self-focusing in photopolymerizable media is possible, owing to a <b>photoreaction</b> dependent refractive index, {{and the fact that}} refractive index in polymers is proportional to molecular weight and crosslinking degree which increases over the duration of photo-polymerization.|$|E
