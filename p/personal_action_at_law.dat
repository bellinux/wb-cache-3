50|$|Although jury {{trials are}} in theory {{possible}} in the Court's original jurisdiction cases, {{there has not been}} one since Georgia v. Brailsford in 1794. In 1950, in the case United States v. Louisiana, the state of Louisiana moved for a jury trial, but the Court denied the motion, ruling that the suit was an equity action and not an <b>action</b> <b>at</b> <b>law,</b> and that therefore the Seventh Amendment guarantee of a jury trial did not apply. If a matter involving an <b>action</b> <b>at</b> <b>law</b> did come before the court, however, a jury would likely be empaneled and would hear the case alongside the justices of the Court.|$|R
5000|$|The {{enactment}} of the Rules Enabling Act on June 19, 1934, was a revolutionary {{moment in the history}} of civil procedure in the United States. The law repealed the archaic [...] "conformity principle" [...] which had governed <b>actions</b> <b>at</b> <b>law</b> (and only <b>actions</b> <b>at</b> <b>law)</b> in U.S. federal courts for over 140 years; namely, the rule that federal courts should conform their procedure in such actions to that of the courts in the state in which they were located. The conformity principle had caused major problems for federal courts that did not actually sit in the United States, such as the United States Court for China.|$|R

30|$|The {{distinction}} between tensions and conflicts is tricky to analyze.

50|$|It is {{immaterial}} that in {{this case}} it does not appear that there are other creditors than the plaintiffs in error.

5000|$|Procedure in {{the early}} federal courts was rather incoherent. The Process Act of 1792 {{authorized}} the federal courts to write their own procedural rules for everything but <b>actions</b> <b>at</b> <b>law.</b> In the context of <b>actions</b> <b>at</b> <b>law,</b> the Process Act of 1789 was so poorly written that it forced a federal court sitting in a state to apply the common law rules of pleading and procedure that were in effect in the state {{at the time it}} joined the Union, regardless of whether the state had modified or revised its civil procedure system since. [...] In other words, even though a state's common law pleading system was always constantly evolving through case law, the federal courts in that state were literally frozen in time. The Process Act did not speak to the problem of what law to apply in new states that joined the Union after the original Thirteen Colonies. In 1828, Congress enacted a law which stated that federal courts in new states would follow the civil procedure in effect at the time those states joined the Union.|$|R

50|$|The {{new system}} {{abolished}} the distinction in forms of procedure between an <b>action</b> <b>at</b> <b>law</b> (a civil case demanding monetary damages) and a suit in equity (a civil case demanding non-monetary damages). Under the new procedure, {{rather than having}} to file separate actions, a plaintiff needed to file only one civil action. Eventually Field's civil procedure code was, with some changes, adopted in 24 states. It also influenced later procedural reforms in England and several of her colonies (specifically, the Judicature Acts).|$|R

The record of appeal was prepared as either bill of exceptions for writ of error from an <b>action</b> <b>at</b> <b>law</b> or a transcript for an appeal from a suit in equity.

5000|$|Early {{federal and}} state civil {{procedure}} in the United States was rather ad hoc and was based on traditional common law procedure but with much local variety.

Even worse, discovery was generally unavailable in <b>actions</b> <b>at</b> <b>law.</b> In order to obtain discovery, a party to a legal action had to bring a collateral proceeding, a bill in equity in aid of discovery, just to obtain essential documents or testimony from the opposing party.|$|R
