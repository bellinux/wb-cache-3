Our long-term goal is {{a better understanding of}} the two-way interaction of waves and sea-ice, in order to improve wave models as well as ice models applicable to a changing Arctic wave- and ice climate. Wind, wave and ice information has been retrieved from space-borne SAR imagery (TerraSAR-X), collected during summer 2014 in the Beaufort Sea.

This information complements and validates model data (Wavewatch III) for the spatial and temporal evolution of sea state in the Arctic. We will present examples of wind and wave fields under different wind forcing and ice conditions, and discuss the advantages of the three observational/modelling approaches. The examples highlight the strong spatial heterogeneity of the wave field in arctic regions, and the need for high resolution spatial wave observations. Satellite-based wave field observations can bridge the gap between the single <b>point</b> <b>buoy</b> observation that provide high resolution time series of wave parameters, and the output of wave models which are of relatively coarse resolution and are inherently limited by the quality of the wind and ice input fields, but are unlimited in their spatial and temporal extent...|$|R

40|$|Electric energy {{conversion}} {{is an important}} issue in today's society as our daily lives largely depend on the supplies of energy. Two energy sources are studied for conversion in the present thesis, ocean waves and hydropower. The work focuses on the generator and the transmission of its output to the electric grid. Different approaches have been used, over the years, to convert the energy in ocean waves, and the method presently used is based on a <b>point</b> absorber (<b>buoy)</b> directly coupled to a linear generator on the seabed. A varying alternating voltage is induced with such configuration, where both the amplitude and the frequency changes continuously. The target is to connect several units in a farm, and thereby decrease the fluctuations in power production. This is shown to be possible to accomplish with a rectifier connected to each generator. Transmission systems can be designed with converters and transformers to connect the farm to the electric grid onshore. Several aspects of the concept are considered as well as interconnection issues. Analytical calculations verified by finite element simulations and measured data are used to model the behaviour of a linear generator. A series expanded expression for the ideal no-load flux and EMF (electromotive force) is derived, which can be developed into an analytical transmission design tool. Hydropower has been used for more than a century. Today many of the stations from the mid 1900 's are up for refurbishment.

40|$|Possible {{environmental}} effects of marine and hydrokinetic (MHK) energy development are not well understood, and yet regulatory agencies are required to make decisions in spite of substantial uncertainty about environmental impacts and their long-term effects. An understanding of risk associated with likely interactions between MHK installations and aquatic receptors, including animals, habitats, and ecosystems, can help reduce the level of uncertainty and focus regulatory actions and scientific studies on interactions of most concern. As {{a first step in}} developing the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) Environmental Risk Evaluation System (ERES), PNNL scientists conducted a preliminary risk screening analysis on three initial MHK cases - a tidal project in Puget Sound using Open Hydro turbines, a wave project off the coast of Oregon using Ocean Power Technologies <b>point</b> attenuator <b>buoys,</b> and a riverine current project in the Mississippi River using Free Flow turbines. Through an iterative process, the screening analysis revealed that top-tier stressors in all three cases were the effects of the dynamic physical presence of the device (e. g., strike), accidents, and effects of the static physical presence of the device (e. g., habitat alteration). Receptor interactions with these stressors at the four highest tiers of risk were dominated by marine mammals (cetaceans and pinnipeds) and birds (diving and non-diving); only the riverine case (Free Flow) included different receptors in the third tier (fish) and the fourth tier (benthic invertebrates). Although this screening analysis provides a preliminary analysis of vulnerability of environmental receptors to stressors associated with MHK installations, probability analysis, especially of risk associated with chemical toxicity and accidents such as oil spills or lost gear, will be necessary to further understand high-priority risks. Subject matter expert review of this process and results is required and is planned for the first quarter of FY 11.

40|$|The present work shows a {{simplified}} reliability {{approach to the}} design of a buoy of a wave energy converter (WEC) in composite material. The main scope is to demonstrate that composite materials can be successfully used in WEC manufacturing without losing confidence in the reliability of the final product. The main steps of the approach to the design are: (i) a statistically relevant assessment of the wave resource using wave buoy data, (ii) a test for studying how waves transfer loads on the buoy and (iii) how those loads produce stresses and possibly failure on the structure. The time constrains of the project have not permitted the establishment of real physical tests so computer based simulations were performed. Three modules of the software suite ANSYS® are used and in particular the module AQWA™ are used for assessing how waves transfer loads on the buoy, the module “Static Structural” for evaluating how those loads produce stresses on the structure and finally the ACP™ module for establishing how those stresses are borne by an isotropic material such as fibre reinforced plastic. A <b>point</b> absorber <b>buoy</b> has been chosen because it is a relatively large component, with a relative complex shape, with loads spread on a large surface area and with few stress concentrations. These characteristics make the use of composite material likely. The Wave Hub site has been chosen as the design location of the WEC because it has very good resources and a lot of climate data are available. The results show that a lot of uncertainty related to the use of composite material can be removed using a reliability approach.

40|$|Renewable {{forms of}} energy are {{becoming}} increasingly important to consider, as the global energy demand continues to grow. Wave energy {{is one of these}} widely available forms, but it is largely unexploited. A common design for a wave energy converter is called a <b>point</b> absorber or <b>buoy.</b> The buoy typically oats on the surface or just {{below the surface of the}} water, and captures energy from the movement of the waves. It can use the motion of the waves to drive a pump to generate electricity and to create potable water.

40|$|Wave {{energy is}} a {{renewable}} energy source with a large potential {{to contribute to the}} world's electricity production. There exist several technologies on how to convert the energy in the ocean waves into electric energy. The wave energy converter (WEC) presented in this thesis is based on a linear synchronous generator. The generator is placed on the seabed and driven by a <b>point</b> absorbing <b>buoy</b> on the ocean surface. Instead of having one large unit, several smaller units are interconnected to increase the total installed power. To convert and interconnect the power from the generators, marine substations are used. The marine substations are placed on the seabed and convert the fluctuating AC from the generators into an AC suitable for grid connection. The work presented in the thesis focuses on the first steps in the electric energy conversion, converting the voltage out from the generators into DC, which {{have an impact on the}} WEC's ability to absorb and produce power. The purpose has been to investigate how the generator will operate when it is subjected to different load cases and to obtain guidelines on how future systems could be improved. Offshore experiments and simulations have been done on full scale generators connected to four different loads, i. e. one linear resistive load and three different non-linear loads representing different cases for grid connected WECs. The results show that the power can be controlled and optimized by choosing a suitable system for the WEC. It is not obvious which kind of system is the most preferable, since there are many different parameters that have an impact on the system performance, such as the size of the buoy, how the generator is designed, the number of WECs, the highest allowed complexity of the system, costs and so on. Therefore, the design of the electrical system should preferably be carried out in parallel with the design of the WEC in order to achieve an efficient system.
