She now {{commanded}} large fees and was notoriously temperamental, but Offenbach was adamant that no other singer could match her as Hélène. Rehearsals for the premiere at the Théâtre des Variétés were tempestuous, with Schneider and the principal mezzo-soprano feuding, the censor fretting about the satire of the imperial court, and the manager of the theatre attempting to rein in Offenbach's extravagance with <b>production</b> <b>expenses.</b> Once again the success of the piece was inadvertently assured by the critic Janin; his scandalised notice was strongly countered by liberal critics and the ensuing publicity again brought the public flocking.|$|E

The use of the term [...] "progressive" [...] to describe groups that follow in the style of bands from ten to twenty years earlier is somewhat controversial, as it has been seen as a contradiction of the spirit of experimentation and progress.

[...] A Hollywood insider said the executives {{were concerned about the}} film's portrayal of violence. [...] The premiere was delayed until the following year so changes could be made. [...] Many scenes were excised from Thulsa Doom's attack on Conan's village, including the close-up shots on the severed head of Conan's mother; the late notice of the changes forced Poledouris to quickly adjust his score before recording music for the sequence. [...] Other scenes of violence that were cut included Subotai's slaying of a monster {{at the top of the}} Tower of Serpents and Conan chopping off a pickpocket's arm in a bazaar.

60|$|To {{demonstrate}} this, we {{must turn}} to an elementary principle which was discussed {{in a former}} chapter.(290) General low wages do not cause low prices, nor high wages high prices, within the country itself. General prices are not raised by a rise of wages, {{any more than they}} would be raised by an increase of the quantity of labor required in all <b>production.</b> <b>Expenses</b> which affect all commodities equally have no influence on prices. If the maker of broadcloth or cutlery, and nobody else, had to pay higher wages, the price of his commodity would rise, just as it would if he had to employ more labor; because otherwise he would gain less profit than other producers, and nobody would engage in the employment. But if everybody has to pay higher wages, or everybody to employ more labor, the loss must be submitted to; as it affects everybody alike, no one can hope {{to get rid of it}} by a change of employment; each, therefore, resigns himself to a diminution of profits, and prices remain as they were. In like manner, general low wages, or a general increase in the productiveness of labor, does not make prices low, but profits high. If wages fall (meaning here by wages the cost of labor), why, on that account, should the producer lower his price? He will be forced, it may be said, by the competition of other capitalists who will crowd into his employment. But other capitalists are also paying lower wages, and by entering into competition with him they would gain nothing but what they are gaining already. The rate, then, at which labor is paid, as well as the quantity of it which is employed, affects neither the value nor the price of the commodity produced, except in so far as it is peculiar to that commodity, and not common to commodities generally.|$|E

5000|$|Two-perf 35 mm is a production-only format, {{that must}} be {{converted}} to other formats for distribution. For distribution prints for theatrical venues, the frame is enlarged from a 2-perf flat ratio to a 4-perf anamorphic ratio. Enlarging the image to the 35 mm print subsequently enlarges the negative's film grain. (Although some cineastes sought this visual feel for the story; e.g. westerns photographed to appear unpolished, thereby enhancing the period settings' verisimilitude.)

40|$|The poultry {{industry}} has experienced unprecedented efficiencies since 1960 {{in large part}} due to vertical integration facilitated by production contracts between growers and integrators. As growers seek information about contract production {{they need to be}} well informed about all aspects of the process, especially potential income. Recent poultry grower complaints have surfaced as a result of incorrect expense and revenue expectations. The Interactive Broiler Income Spreadsheet (IBIS) is developed to enable current and prospective poultry producers to better estimate income. IBIS, an unbiased Excel spreadsheet tool to assist in decision-making regarding broiler production profitability, uses actual grower expense and revenue information or, alternatively, grower-panel default data to assess income under various grower-specified <b>production,</b> <b>expense,</b> and price scenarios. Poultry integrator grower service personnel, lenders, and Cooperative Extension professionals will utilize IBIS to assist growers in operational planning and risk tolerance identification in varying economic situations.
