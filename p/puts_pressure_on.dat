5|$|The line 8...Qa3 <b>puts</b> <b>{{pressure}}</b> <b>on</b> {{the white}} queenside pawns, pressure that may later be intensified with Nf6–e4. The black queen also gains {{access to the}} a5-square, from where it <b>puts</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the e1–a5 diagonal aimed towards the white king. After 9.Rc1 f6 10.exf6Nxf6 11.Qd2 d6 12.Nd4 0-0 we reach {{the position of the}} famous game between Rubinstein and Vidmar, when Rubinstein erred with 13.e3? and later lost. After the better 13.f3 the correct method for Black is to target the c4-pawn with the regrouping Ne5/Qc5. Hence Lalic thinks 11.Qd2 is inappropriate and gives Black excellent counterplay, and prefers 11.Qd3 or even 11.Qd1!? After 11.Qd3 0-0 12.g3 d6 13.Bg2 Black should switch to a materialistic mode with 13...Qxa2.|$|E

5|$|On February 21, 2013, Young {{signed a}} minor league deal with the Washington Nationals and an {{invitation}} to training camp. On March 26, 2013 he was granted his unconditional release by the Nationals after opting out of his contract. He was re-signed by the Nationals on April 4, 2013. He was then assigned to Triple-A Syracuse. He made his season debut on April 23 against Rochester, giving up 6 runs in 4.2 innings. He made 6 additional starts before going {{on the disabled list}} with a neck injury on May 28, 2 days after leaving a start against Columbus after the first inning. He made 2 starts {{at the end of the}} year in the Gulf Coast League and with Short-Season Auburn before the end of the injury-marred season. In 9 total starts, he went 1–2 with a 6.81 ERA, striking out 21 in 37 innings. After experiencing pain in his shoulder and neck, he had surgery to repair what was diagnosed as thoracic outlet syndrome. This condition is a nerve problem that <b>puts</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> a pitcher's shoulder. On November 19, 2013, Young re-signed with the Nationals on {{a minor league}} deal. He was released on March 25, 2014.|$|E

25|$|To help combat ocean acidification, some {{laws are}} in place to reduce {{greenhouse}} gases such as carbon dioxide. The Clean Water Act <b>puts</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> state government agencies to monitor and limit runoff of pollutants that can cause ocean acidification. Stormwater surge preventions are also in place, as well as coastal buffers between agricultural land and the coastline. This act also ensures that delicate watershed ecosystems are intact, such as wetlands. The Clean Water Act is funded by the federal government, and is monitored by various watershed groups. Many land use laws aim to reduce CO2 emissions by limiting deforestation. Deforestation causes erosion, which releases {{a large amount of}} carbon stored in the soil, which then flows into the ocean, contributing to ocean acidification. Incentives are used to reduce miles traveled by vehicles, which reduces the carbon emissions into the atmosphere, thereby reducing the amount of dissolved CO2 in the ocean. State and federal governments also control coastal erosion, which releases stored carbon in the soil into the ocean, increasing ocean acidification. High-end satellite technology is increasingly being employed to monitor coral reef conditions.|$|E

500|$|The half-open e-file gives Black {{a certain}} degree of {{influence}} over the kingside. A rook on e8 <b>puts</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> White's e-pawn and restrains it from advancing. Tactics involving ...Nxe4 are not uncommon—the games Averbakh–Tal, USSR championship, Riga 1958, and Uhlmann–Fischer, Interzonal, Palma de Mallorca 1970, are well-known examples. Black can initiate further kingside activity by playing ...Nd7-e5 followed by ...g7-g5. The pawn move prevents White from driving away the knight with f2-f4, and sets up the possibility of Black bringing a knight on f4 via g6 or h5. Further space-gaining pawn advances such as ...g5-g4 and ...f7-f5 may even be possible.|$|E
500|$|The {{ownership}} of Chelsea by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich also caused friction between both clubs. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger said in May 2005: [...] "They are a financially doped club. They have enhancement of performances through financial resources which are unlimited. For me, it's {{a kind of}} doping because it's {{not in any way}} linked to their resources. It <b>puts</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the market that is not very healthy. They can go to Steven Gerrard or Rio Ferdinand and 'say how much do you earn, we'll give you twice as much.'" [...] Wenger admitted this put Arsenal at a disadvantage in the transfer market; in the case of Shaun Wright-Phillips, a long-term target, Chelsea's interest meant Arsenal needed to wait before making a bid. The player eventually joined Chelsea from Manchester City for £21 million.|$|E

500|$|The curved design offered {{two major}} {{benefits}} {{to the structure of}} the building. [...] First, curved designs, such as that found in Calatrava's Turning Torso in Malmö, Sweden, tend to add to the strength of a structure. [...] A similar principle has been used in the past with curved stadium roofs. [...] In addition to structural support, the curved face of the exterior would minimize wind forces. [...] In rectangular buildings, a fluid wind flow <b>puts</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the windward face of the building; while air moves around it, a suction is applied to the leeward face. [...] This often causes a sway in tall buildings usually counteracted, at least partially, by stiffening the structure or by using a dynamic wind damper. [...] Since the curved design of the Chicago Spire would not completely negate wind forces, a tapering concrete core and twelve shear walls radiating from it were planned to counteract the remaining wind load.|$|E
500|$|Three days later, Costa was {{involved}} in controversy in a 2–0 home win over Arsenal; he repeatedly slapped Laurent Koscielny and chest-bumped him to the ground, and then confronted Gabriel, who allegedly tried to kick him and was sent off, though footage from ESPN Brazil later showed that little to no contact actually took place. He escaped any punishment at the time. His conduct was deemed [...] "disgusting" [...] by visiting manager Arsène Wenger, and teammate Kurt Zouma initially reacted by saying, [...] "Diego likes to cheat a lot," [...] but later clarified that he meant that [...] "Diego is a player who <b>puts</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> his opponents". As a consequence, on 21 September, {{he was charged with}} violent conduct by the FA. and the following day he was given a three-match suspension. Gabriel's red card was also rescinded, although he was given a one-match ban and £10,000 fine for improper conduct after failing to leave the pitch immediately. After this incident, the Daily Express wrote that Costa was [...] "named as [...] Premier League's dirtiest player".|$|E

DeGarmo said: [...] "Unfortunately, she’s not as good a singer as she and her father think she is [...] Angelina is a bit oblivious to reality, but will slowly come to grips with it over the next few weeks. As a singer myself, it’s liberating to get on the set and throw all ego – and notes – aside and surprise people." [...] DeGarmo commented: [...] "It's fantastically hilarious because it puts the poor kid in a horrible predicament!" [...] She said that Angelina was into Top 40 music at first, but: [...] "the writers have her singing the American standards — Judy Garland, that sort of thing. We want the audience to be really familiar with the songs, so they can tell how badly Angie is butchering them." [...] Michael Logan of TV Guide noted that you needed [...] "skill to play a bad singer", to which DeGarmo said that it's harder than people realize: [...] "but it's really liberating {{to get out there and}} be bad. You just throw your ego to the wind and sing for Jesus." [...] Devon would eventually go on to make Angelina a good singer. Angelina briefly fired Devon for adding rap verses to a song of hers which was soaring on the charts, but he retained the rights of the track.|$|E

Andrew later turns up in Erinsborough much to Donna's shock.

Robbie added [...] "Ringo and Donna were definitely going through a rocky patch for a while, but things were starting to look up. If she comes clean, they might find a way to work through it. But it doesn't look good." [...] Sam Clark said that Ringo and Donna's love for each other is very strong, but he was not sure if it was strong enough to survive a betrayal. Robbie and Clark also said that the couple were heading in different directions career-wise and it would be challenging for them. Donna later begins an affair with Andrew after he helps her out and then <b>puts</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> her to give in to their attraction.

He's perfect for the world Donna is trying to get into." [...] However, Robbie admitted that Ringo is the perfect guy for Donna as they balance each other out well. Ringo leaves for Sydney after finding out Donna cheated on him and when he returns his relationship with Donna is [...] "frosty". Robbie commented on the ex-couple's future and said [...] "I think at the moment it's quite in the balance.
