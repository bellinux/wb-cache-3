2500|$|The Pacific {{silver fir}} (Abies amabilis) is {{extremely}} tolerant of shade {{and does not}} fare as well in drought or warmer temperatures. [...] It can grow as high as [...] and reach [...] in diameter. The understory communities of the Pacific silver fir can vary depending on moisture availability. Common understory shrubs include the vine maple, salal, Cascade Oregon grape, blueberry, mountain huckleberry, devil's club, and fool's huckleberry. Common understory herbs are bear grass, twin flower, <b>pipsissewa,</b> dwarf dogwood or bunchberry, bead lily, trailing blackberry, low false Solomon’s seal, foam flower, trillium, oak fern, and lady fern. The microclimate of the understory is moderated by the forest canopy causing the conditions to be cooler and moister {{in the summer and}} warmer in the winter. Pacific silver fir seedlings and saplings are often found growing under their own canopies or those of a mixed canopy forest. Along streams in this ecoregion, breaks in the forest are replaced by mountain alder, willow and vine maple and herbs such as saxifrage, yellow willow-herb, monkey flowers, and bluebells can be found. Mountain alder and vine maple can also be found around lake edges and in areas of flat or gentle slopes, bogs, or marsh habitat. Examples of Pacific silver fir forests {{can be found in the}} Commonwealth Basin and the Snow Lake areas of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness.|$|E

50|$|The {{source of}} Sviyaga River {{is the most}} {{important}} feature of the Protected Area, with significant conservation and environmental value. It lies about 5 km to the southwest of Kuzovatovo, where the land rises to a height of 332 m above sea level. At this height the vegetation consists of tall-trunked pine wood, cowberry shrubs, and bilberry. Here various representatives of the pear family are found: one-sided pear, rotundifolious pear, verdant and small, <b>pipsissewa</b> umbellate, and sometimes a rare orchid plant can be found, neottianta cucullata. The total area is 8 hectares.|$|E
5000|$|The mid-{{elevation}} {{forests in}} the North Cascades with an elevation between 2000 to 4300 ft is the Silver Fir Ecoregion. The Silver Fir Ecoregion makes up {{for much of the}} valleys in the Alpine Lakes area. The average annual temperature in this ecoregion is 42 F and the average precipitation in centimeters is between 220 - 280 cm. Typical montane forests in this ecoregion is dominated by Pacific silver fir and also contains noble fir, Douglas fir, and Alaska yellow-cedar. Coarse woody debris is very characteristic of the Silver Fir Ecoregion, providing microsites for organisms. The Pacific silver fir zone is in some of the steepest parts of the topography and heavy snow often leads to avalanche gullies. In every major drainage basin along the western slopes of the Cascade Mountains there is evidence of avalanche tracks breaking up the forested vegetation with nonforested vegetation. These gullies provide sites of new successional growth as they move toward a coniferous forest again. Because of the dense forests of the Silver Fir Ecoregion, it was the preferred area for commercial logging prior to designation of areas as wilderness. [...] The Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis) is extremely tolerant of shade and does not fare as well in drought or warmer temperatures.

40|$|Aims: Lactate {{dehydrogenase}} (LDH) -A {{is highly}} expressed in diverse human malignant tumors, parallel to aggressive metastatic disease, resistance to radiation /chemotherapy and clinically poor outcome. Although this enzyme constitutes a plausible target in treatment of advanced cancer, {{there are few}} known LDH-A inhibitors. Study Design: In this work, we utilized a high-throughput enzyme micro-array format to screen and evaluate > 900 commonly used medicinal plant extracts (0. 00001 -. 5 mg/ml) for capacity to inhibit activity of recombinant full length human LDHA; EC. 1. 1. 1. 27. Methodology: The protein sequence of purified enzyme was confirmed using 1 D gel electrophoresis- MALDI-TOF-MS/MS, enzyme activity was validated by oxidation of NADH (500 μM) and kinetic inhibition established {{in the presence of}} a known inhibitor (Oxalic Acid). Results: Of the natural extracts tested, the lowest IC 50 s [< 0. 001 mg/ml] were obtained by: Chinese Gallnut (Melaphis chinensis gallnut), Bladderwrack (Fucus vesiculosus), Kelp (Laminaria Japonica) and Babul (Acacia Arabica). Forty-six additional herbs contained significant LDH-A inhibitory properties with IC 50 s [< 0. 07 mg/ml], some of which have common names of Arjun, <b>Pipsissewa,</b> Cinnamon, Pink Rose Buds/ Petals, Wintergreen, Cat’s Claw, Witch Hazel Root and Rhodiola Root. Conclusion: These findings reflect relative potency by rank of commonly used herbs and plants that contain human LDH-A inhibitory properties. Future research will be required to isolate chemical constituents within these plants responsible for LDH-A inhibition and investigate potential therapeutic application...|$|E
