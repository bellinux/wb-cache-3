5000|$|Pull fuse: A <b>pull</b> <b>fuse</b> is a zero-delay fuse used in booby traps: {{the grenade}} detonates {{immediately}} when the striker retaining pin is removed. The pin is typically {{attached to a}} tripwire.|$|E
50|$|When {{used as a}} {{stake mine}} the mine is {{inverted}} and an MUV type <b>pull</b> <b>fuse</b> is inserted into {{the base of the}} mine, and the normal pressure fuse hole is used to attach the mine to the stake. When used with the fragmentation jacket the mine has a lethal radius of 15 metres, although the fragments may be lethal at greater range.|$|E
5000|$|Timed fuse: In a timed fuse grenade, {{the fuse}} is ignited on {{release of the}} safety lever, and {{detonation}} occurs following a timed delay. Timed fuse grenades are generally preferred to hand-thrown percussion grenades because their fusing mechanisms are safer and more robust than those used in percussion grenades. Fuses are frequently fixed, though the Russian UZRGM (УЗРГМ) fuses are interchangeable and allow the delay to be varied, or replaced by a zero-delay <b>pull</b> <b>fuse.</b> This is potentially dangerous due {{to the risk of}} confusion.|$|E
40|$|In Streams à {{la carte}} we address {{extensibility}} shortcomings in libraries for lazy-streaming queries {{with a new}} design. The architecture underlying this design borrows heavily from Oliveira and Cook 2 ̆ 7 s object algebra solution to the expression problem, extended with a design that exposes the push/pull character of the iteration, and an encoding of higher-kinded polymorphism. In this library we apply our design to Java and show that the addition of full extensibility is accompanied by high performance, matching or exceeding that of the original, highly-optimized Java streams library. In this artifact we present a fundamental set of sequential operators map, filter, reduce, count, take/limit and iterate. Additionally we present the behaviors that {{are discussed in the}} paper: push, <b>pull,</b> <b>fused</b> <b>pull,</b> logging, id (for blocking terminal operators), future (for non-blocking terminal operators) ...|$|R

50|$|NH fuses can {{be changed}} with power on the circuit, but this {{requires}} special training, special tools, and personal protective equipment. An isolation protection mat and isolating gloves may be necessary. <b>Pulling</b> any <b>fuse</b> cartridge under load can cause an electric arc, which may cause serious and fatal injuries without protection equipment. NH disconnecting switches facilitate the safety of cartridge replacement.|$|R
50|$|The mine {{consisted}} of a large cylindrical main body containing a 60 mm mortar shell linked by a steel tube to a fuse holder which held either a pressure fuse or a <b>pull</b> <b>fuse</b> for use with tripwires. A rectangular thin metal plate positioned halfway up {{the main body of}} the mine provides additional support. When the fuse is triggered, a flash travels along the steel tube to the base of the main body, where it ignites a 0.8 g black powder charge, launching the mortar shell from the mine and igniting a pyrotechnic delay.|$|E
5000|$|The YaM-5 ({{anti-tank}} mine 5 kilograms) was a Soviet anti-tank blast mine with a wood case. Various {{wood was}} used. The mine {{consists of a}} rectangular wooden box with a hinged lid that overlaps {{the front of the}} mine. A slot in the hinged lid's side through which an MUV <b>pull</b> <b>fuse</b> is placed. A wooden pressure bar is sometimes used {{on the edge of the}} lid above the slot. A nail is placed horizontally through the loop of the MUV fuse's striker retaining pin and two loops on the bottom of the lid's slot.|$|E
25|$|The bank's stagecoach {{made its}} way through the crowded square at about 10:30 am. When the stagecoach was close enough, one of the robbers gave a signal to attack. Once the signal was given, robbers <b>pulled</b> the <b>fuses</b> on their grenades and threw them at the carriage. The {{resulting}} explosions killed horses and guards. The robbers then began shooting at the various security men guarding the stagecoach, as well as those securing the square.|$|R
5000|$|Another of O'Shave's tracks, [...] "Mauve Shoes are Awful", {{has been}} {{included}} on the Stateside Hyped2death compilation disc Messthetics no 4. The original of 'Mauve Shoes' had Hats Dad (Hat/Fezz - ginger vocalist and human synth), famously threatening to [...] "Chop the Bloody Electricity Off" [...] to stop the racket being made in Hat's house whilst recording the track. Hats Dad claimed to have got the fabled 'Two Stings' whilst trying to <b>pull</b> the <b>fuse</b> out. Hats Dad, (and his fabled 'Two Stings') made it to vinyl.In 2004 he recorded a CD single [...] "Katie Derham's Bum" [...] in adoration of ITN newsreader Katie Derham.|$|R

Nicolae, along with his advisors, watch the {{broadcast}}. Rayford, in the cockpit, asks the copilot to take over. He then goes out and <b>pulls</b> the <b>fuse</b> to stop Nicolae from ruining the broadcast. Rabbi Ben-Judah then gives his speech about Jesus being the Messiah, and how {{he needs to be}} forgiven. Nicolae then orders the broadcast to be cut. In Chicago; Ivy, Chloe, and Bruce are watching, with Ivy crying. When the broadcast is cut, Ivy is stunned, but Chloe leads her to Jesus, with Bruce praying with them.|$|R

The crew failed to read out the landing procedure checklist and therefore didn't select the gear down option. Subsequent investigation {{revealed that the}} pilot instructed the co-pilot to <b>pull</b> the <b>fuse</b> case from the warning system because the repeated warnings that the landing gear was not deployed were, [...] "irritating and distracting," [...] him as he attempted to land. With the warning horn disabled, the Korean pilot brought the plane in and slid {{down the length of}} the runway on the central structural rib in the belly of {{the aircraft}}.

5000|$|... "Good Goes the Bye" [...] is a '80s-{{inspired}} mid-tempo synthpop track. Sonically {{inspired by}} {{music of the}} British musical duo Eurythmics, Clarkson revealed that the song's driving source is very much its beats. Written in the key of Db major, the song is {{about the end of}} a failing relationship, utilizing the adage [...] "Rome wasn't built in a day" [...] and a simile of <b>pulling</b> the <b>fuse</b> out of grenades in its lyrical content, while its chorus features the idioms such as slam the door and [...] "break the heart" [...] in its structure. On March 2, 2015, the day before Piece by Pieces street date, RCA Records, The Hershey Company and Viacom Media Networks premiered the track on three of Viacom's music channels: MTV, VH1, and CMT.|$|R
5000|$|The fuse holder, {{also called}} the [...] "fuse tube" [...] or [...] "door", an {{insulating}} tube which contains the replaceable fuse element. When the contained fuse melts ("blows"), the fuse holder drops out of the upper contact, breaking the circuit, and hangs from a hinge on its lower end. This hanging fuse holder provides a visible indication that the fuse has operated and assurance that the circuit is open. The circuit can also be opened manually by <b>pulling</b> out the <b>fuse</b> holder using a hot stick.|$|R

The robbers then began shooting at the various security men guarding the stagecoach, as well as those securing the square. Though the explosions had killed many of the guards and horses, one of the horses harnessed to the stagecoach was injured but still alive. The bleeding animal bolted from the scene pulling the stagecoach with it. Two of the robbers and Kamo chased after the runaway money-laden stagecoach. [...] One of the robbers threw another grenade at the escaping stagecoach killing the horse and stopping the stagecoach. After the stagecoach was stopped, Kamo raced to the stopped carriage in his phaeton, firing his pistol as he drove. Once he got to the stagecoach, other robbers who had reached the coach helped throw the money into Kamo's carriage.|$|R
25|$|The ground-maintenance crew {{locked out}} the thrust {{reverser}} for engine #3 (treated as a {{minimum equipment list}} item) because of technical problems with the thrust reverser sensors during the landing of TWA 881 at JFK, prior to Flight 800's departure. Additionally, severed cables for the engine #3 thrust reverser were replaced. During refueling of the aircraft, the volumetric shutoff (VSO) control was {{believed to have been}} triggered before the tanks were full. To continue the pressure fueling, a TWA mechanic overrode the automatic VSO by <b>pulling</b> the volumetric <b>fuse</b> and an overflow circuit breaker. Maintenance records indicate that the airplane had numerous VSO-related maintenance writeups in the weeks before the accident.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the player}} is given {{considerable}} freedom {{to explore the}} game-area {{the solution to the}} game is a linear progression through various puzzles. The main character is usually given hints on how to complete the next stage via in-game phone calls. Players are able to enter buildings (although the view remains outside the building with Sam visible through the windows - there is no cutaway), switch lights on and off, open doors and collect money (by somersaulting onto the bills blowing down the street). Sam can also don disguises for various parts of his mission and at times will also have to evade police - for example by <b>pulling</b> out building <b>fuses</b> to cut the lights {{at the start of the}} game when he finds a dead body. Sam carries a limited amount of money in dollar bills and this ticks away slowly with the game ending if Sam's money-level reaches zero.|$|R
50|$|In 1933, the Chinese {{designed}} {{and produced a}} grenade based on the German Model 1924. This grenade was deployed under name 'Type 23' by the National Revolutionary Army. In comparison to the Model 24, the Chinese version was shorter in length and had a smaller diameter. The Type 23 operated very similarly to its German counterpart, but with a few exceptions; most significantly, the fuse delay was slightly longer, at {{five and a half}} seconds. The other differences included a small thumb release lever to hold the screw-on cap in place, and the lack of a porcelain bead attached to the <b>fuse's</b> <b>pull</b> cord (both unlike the German grenade). Some of these Type 23 grenades were used as booby traps, by removing the cap and attaching the pull cord to a tripwire. As the United States entered the war, and operations in the Pacific Theater began, the Chinese Type 23 grenade was mistakenly listed in early intelligence reports as being Japanese made.|$|R
5000|$|During World War II, various nations made improvised {{anti-tank}} grenades {{by putting}} a number of defensive high explosive grenades into a sandbag. Due to their weight, these were normally thrown from very close range or directly placed in vulnerable spots onto an enemy vehicle. Another method used by the British Home Guard in 1940 was to place dynamite or some other high explosive in a thick sock and cover the lower part with axle grease and then place the grease covered part in a suitable size tin can. The sock was <b>pulled</b> out, the <b>fuse</b> lit and the sock thrown {{against the side of}} the tank turret in the hope it would stick until the explosion. If successful, it caused internal spalling of the armor plate, killing or injuring the tank crew inside. It is not known if this type of improvised anti-tank grenade was ever successfully employed in combat. By late 1940, the British had brought into production a purpose-built adhesive anti-tank grenade - known as the [...] "Sticky bomb" [...] - that was not very successful in combat.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the {{suspension}} thermal noise, the second generation GW interferometric detectors will employ monolithic suspensions in fused silica to hold the mirrors. The fibres are produced by melting and <b>pulling</b> apart a <b>fused</b> silica rod, obtaining a long thin wire with two thicker heads. The dynamics of such a fibre is in principle different from that of a cylindrical, regular fibre, because most of the deformation energy is stored in the neck region where the diameter is variable. This is an advantage, since adjusting the neck tapering, a thermoelastic noise cancellation effect can be obtained. Therefore, a careful study of the suspensions behavior is necessary to estimate the overall noise and to optimize the control strategy. To simplify the control design, a simple three segment model for the silica fibres has been developed, fully equivalent to the beam equation at low frequencies. The model, analytically proved for a regular cylindrical fibre, can be extended to a fibre with tapered necks, provided that the equivalent bending length is suitably measured. We developed a tool to measure the position of the bending point for each fibre, thus allowing to experimentally check the validity of the model. A numerical code has been written to solve the beam equation for wires with varying diameter. This code confirms the validity of the three segment model. Moreover, it is possible to extend the solution to higher frequencies thus computing the transfer function and the energy distribution of the suspension system and estimating the thermal noise contribution...|$|R
5000|$|On November 17, {{the shore}} column struck the enemy's trail and soon {{came upon a}} number of bamboo guns. One of these guns, emplaced to command the trail, had the fuse burning. Acting {{corporal}} Harry Glenn rushed forward and <b>pulled</b> out the <b>fuse.</b> The attack of the Marines was a complete surprise, and the enemy was routed. After driving the insurgents from their positions the Marines crossed the river and assaulted the cliff defenses. In order to reach the enemy's position, the Marines had to climb the cliffs, which rose sheer from the river to the height of about 200 feet and were honeycombed with caves, to which access was had by means of bamboo ladders, and also by narrow ledges with bamboo hand rails. Tons of rocks were suspended in cages held in position by vine cables (known as bejuco), in readiness to be precipitated upon people and boats below. The guerrillas were unable to spring their trap, however, because of heavy covering fire provided by Medal of Honor recipient Gunnery Sergeant John H. Quick on the Colt machine gun. The Marines scaled the 200 foot cliffs and with their Krag-Jorgensen rifles and [...]45 Caliber pistols, drove the insurgents from their positions and destroyed their camps. Major Waller's detachment, coming up the river in boats, did not arrive {{in time for the}} attack, which fact probably saved it from disaster; instant destruction would have undoubtedly been the fate of the boats had they undertaken the ascent of the river before the shore column had dislodged the insurgents.|$|R
