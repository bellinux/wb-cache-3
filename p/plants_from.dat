5|$|Banksia serrata {{has shown}} a {{variable}} susceptibility to dieback from the pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi, the plants in sandier soils showing more resistance than those in heavier soils. <b>Plants</b> <b>from</b> Wilsons Promontory were sensitive. The resistance of <b>plants</b> <b>from</b> Flinders Island is unknown. The small size of the stand renders it vulnerable to eradication.|$|E
5|$|Those species {{endemic to}} a very limited area are often most {{threatened}} by the collection of <b>plants</b> <b>from</b> the wild. D. madagascariensis is considered endangered in Madagascar because of the large-scale removal of <b>plants</b> <b>from</b> the wild for exportation; 10 - 200 million plants are harvested for commercial medicinal use annually.|$|E

5|$|Cacti were {{cultivated}} as ornamental <b>plants</b> <b>from</b> {{the time}} they were first brought from the New World. By the early 1800s, enthusiasts in Europe had large collections (often including other succulents alongside cacti). Rare plants were sold for very high prices. Suppliers of cacti and other succulents employed collectors to obtain <b>plants</b> <b>from</b> the wild, in addition to growing their own. In the late 1800s, collectors turned to orchids, and cacti became less popular, although never disappearing from cultivation.|$|E

5|$|Pygmy sundews: A {{group of}} roughly 40 Australian species, they are {{distinguished}} by miniature growth, {{the formation of}} gemmae for asexual reproduction, and dense formation of hairs in the crown center.

5|$|A {{botanical garden}} or botanic garden is a garden {{dedicated}} to the collection, cultivation and display {{of a wide range}} of plants labelled with their botanical names. It may contain specialist plant collections such as cacti and other succulent plants, herb gardens, <b>plants</b> <b>from</b> particular parts of the world, and so on; there may be greenhouses, shadehouses, again with special collections such as tropical plants, alpine plants, or other exotic plants. Visitor services at a botanical garden might include tours, educational displays, art exhibitions, book rooms, open-air theatrical and musical performances, and other entertainment.|$|E
5|$|Carex binervis has an oceanic distribution, {{occurring}} only {{in areas}} of high rainfall, from Finland and Norway, through the British Isles, Germany, Belgium and France, to Spain and Portugal. Within the British Isles, Carex binervis has a westerly and northerly distribution, and is more abundant in the Scotland, Wales and Ireland than in England. <b>Plants</b> <b>from</b> Morocco that were previously referred to C.binervis are now treated as a separate species, C.paulo-vargasii.|$|E

5|$|Insect {{damage to}} the fossilized leaves of {{flowering}} <b>plants</b> <b>from</b> fourteen sites in North America were used {{as a proxy for}} insect diversity across the K–Pg boundary and analyzed to determine the rate of extinction. Researchers found that Cretaceous sites, prior to the extinction event, had rich plant and insect-feeding diversity. During the early Paleocene, however, flora were relatively diverse with little predation from insects, even 1.7million years after the extinction event.|$|E
5|$|Lady Dalhousie donated {{her entire}} East Indian Herbarium to the Botanical Society of Edinburgh. The society noted its quality and made Lady Dalhousie an honorary member in 1837; {{at the time}} of her death she was the only female honorary member. Records of {{correspondence}} with Kew botanist, Sir William Hooker, include large collections of <b>plants</b> <b>from</b> Simla and Penang in 1831. Her collections were included when Joseph Dalton Hooker compiled his Flora Indica.|$|E
5|$|Plant use of {{endophytic}} {{fungi in}} defense {{is a very}} common phenomenon. Most plants have endophytes, microbial organisms that live within them. While some cause disease, others protect <b>plants</b> <b>from</b> herbivores and pathogenic microbes. Endophytes can help the plant by producing toxins harmful to other organisms that would attack the plant, such as alkaloid producing fungi which are common in grasses such as tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea).|$|E

5|$|Some {{non-standard}} {{amino acids}} {{are used as}} defenses against herbivores in plants. For example, canavanine is an analogue of arginine that is found in many legumes, and in particularly large amounts in Canavalia gladiata (sword bean). This amino acid protects the <b>plants</b> <b>from</b> predators such as insects and can cause illness in people if some types of legumes are eaten without processing. The non-protein amino acid mimosine is found in other species of legume, in particular Leucaena leucocephala. This compound is an analogue of tyrosine and can poison animals that graze on these plants.|$|E
5|$|The Majorelle Garden, on Avenue Yacoub el Mansour, was at {{one time}} {{the home of the}} {{landscape}} painter Jacques Majorelle. Famed designer Yves Saint Laurent bought and restored the property, which features a stele erected in his memory, and the Museum of Islamic Art, which is housed in a dark blue building. The garden, open to the public since 1947, has a large collection of <b>plants</b> <b>from</b> five continents including cacti, palms and bamboo.|$|E
5|$|The Tupolev Tu-142 (142; NATO {{reporting}} name: Bear F/J) is a maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft {{derived from}} the Tu-95 turboprop strategic bomber.

The Tu-142 was designed by the Tupolev design bureau, and manufactured by the Kuibyshev Aviation and Taganrog Machinery <b>Plants</b> <b>from</b> 1968 to 1994.

50|$|Potatoes are {{not your}} typical vegetation. Each tuber is capable of {{producing}} a brand new <b>plant</b> <b>from</b> various eye spots. This allows farmers to culture an identical <b>plant</b> <b>from</b> each tuber and in turn cuts costs as each tuber can sprout a dozen new plants. And dozens of new sources of dry rot.|$|R
5|$|The recent {{advent of}} {{artificial}} tissue culture, or more specifically in vitro, technology in Europe and the United States {{has meant that}} plants can be produced in large numbers and sold at relatively low prices (~US$20–$30 {{in the case of}} N. rajah). In vitro propagation refers to production of whole <b>plants</b> <b>from</b> cell cultures derived from explants (generally seeds). This technology has, to a large extent, removed the incentive for collectors to travel to Sabah to collect the plant illegally, and demand for wild-collected plants has fallen considerably in recent years.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{describes}} {{trees and}} shrubs from different places and habitats, as for instance a sheltered part of the Arcadia region near Krane in a deep valley where the sun never reaches, and the silver-fir trees are exceptionally tall. He looks into the plants of Egypt, Libya, Asia, northern regions, and then aquatic <b>plants</b> <b>from</b> the Mediterranean, wetlands especially in Egypt, reeds and rushes. He also considers factors that limit the life of plants including diseases and weather damage.|$|E
5|$|A {{proposed}} 1993 {{treatment of}} T. apollinea as a subspecies of Tephrosia purpurea noted some regional variations, with {{plants in the}} Eastern Desert of Egypt possibly producing smaller pods, leaves, and leaflets, and <b>plants</b> <b>from</b> oases having densely pubescent spreading hairs. Among the features they described as differentiating the apollinea subspecies from the nominate purpurea subspecies were that apollinea has somewhat longer pods (3.55 or sometimes 5.5cm, rather than 34cm), a wider range in the quantity of seeds per pod (generally 79, as low as 3, rather than generally 56, or sometimes 7), the pods being curved upwards rather than downwards, and leaflets having 9 rather than 7 lateral veins.|$|E

Braithwaite (in Botanical Journ. Linn. Soc., London (93: 343-378. 1986) observes that Panigrahi's 12n <b>plant</b> <b>from</b> Madeira is morphologically different from his 12n cytotype from South Africa, which he names Asplenium aethiopicum ssp. dodecaploideum Braithw. and the 12n <b>plant</b> <b>from</b> Madeira is morphologically similar to the 8n <b>plant</b> <b>from</b> South Africa and Sri Lanka-India identified with Asplenium aethiopicum (Burm.)
