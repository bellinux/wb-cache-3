40|$|In {{favourable}} {{conditions of}} low temperature and low oxygen concentration, waterlogged wooden artefacts, such as shipwrecks, can survive underwater in relative good conditions. Nevertheless, {{as a result}} of the action of water and anaerobic bacteria on the cellulose and hemicellulose of the cell walls, waterlogged wood is very fragile and its consolidation is necessary. These conservation treatments are very often expensive and technically difficult, as they involve the replacement of the waterlogging water with the consolidants, filling the cell walls and all cavities in order to <b>prevent</b> <b>stresses</b> during the drying. Since the effectiveness of the treatment strongly depends on its distribution, the penetration depth and the degree of cavities-filling have been evaluated by micro x-ray tomography (µ-CT). Both laboratory and Synchrotron Radiation-based µ-CT experiments have been performed on different samples coming from findings excavated in the San Rossore archaeological site (Pisa, Italy), in order to study in detail how the different application parameters can influence the manner in which the conservation products fill the cavities of the wooden structure (i. e. complete or partial volume filling, complete or partial impregnation of the wooden artefact) ...|$|E
40|$|Although run-of-river {{hydropower}} {{represents a}} key source of renewable energy, it cannot <b>prevent</b> <b>stresses</b> on river ecosystems. This {{is especially true}} in mountain regions, where the outflow of a plant is placed several kilometres downstream of the intake, inducing the depletion of river reaches of considerable length. In this thesis, multi-objective optimization is used {{in the design of the}} capacity of run-of-river plants to identify optimal trade-offs between contrasting objectives: the maximization of the profitability and the minimization of the impact induced by the plant. The latter is quantified either as the upstream/downstream changes of a set of ecologically-relevant flow metrics, or as the loss of hydrological connectivity in the impacted river reaches. Optimal plant sizes are devised for several case studies belonging to catchments in Italy and UK. Results show that the duration of economic optimal design capacity is strongly affected by the nature of the flow regime at the plant intake. In particular, the analysis emphasizes the important distinction between persistent (reduced variability) and erratic (enhanced variability) streamflow regimes. Multi-criteria optimization indicates that in persistent regimes a trade-off between profitability and hydrologic impact is achieved reducing the plant capacity below the economic optimum, whereas in erratic regimes distinct trade-offs are available depending on the relative importance of the different flow statistics. This work also confirms that water abstractions for human exploitation induce ecologically-meaningful and quantifiable impacts on the hydrologic connectivity of altered river reaches, which may limit significantly migratory movements of fish. The application of a probabilistic eco-hydrological model to reproduce the observed immigration rates of Atlantic salmon in a Scottish river shows that limitations of connectivity are more pronounced in years where exceedance probability of relatively high flow is low. The analyses conducted in this thesis show that residual flows represents a key decision variable to preserve the connectivity of impacted river reaches, and thus should be carefully considered in planning environmental policy actions. The analytical tools developed in this thesis could provide a clue for evaluating the environmental footprint of run-of-river plants and improve sustainability of energetic exploitation of surface water...|$|E

40|$|Tianeptine is a well-described {{antidepressant}} {{which has}} been shown to <b>prevent</b> <b>stress</b> from producing deleterious effects on brain structure and function.

Moreover, tianeptine <b>prevents</b> <b>stress</b> from impairing learning and memory, and, importantly, demonstrates memory-enhancing properties in the absence of stress. Recent research has indicated that tianeptine works by normalizing glutamatergic neurotransmission, a mechanism of action that may underlie its effectiveness as an antidepressant.

40|$|Prevention {{of stress}} related ill-health {{is one of}} the most {{important}} occupational health and safety issues of our time. The Swedish Work Environment Act imposes extensive requirements regarding the psychosocial work environment on the employer. The employer is obliged to take all precautions necessary to prevent ill-health, also such ill-health associated with stress at work. These requirements are enforced through rules regarding co-operation between employers and employees, rules of supervision from the Swedish Work Environment Authority and rules concerning criminal liability for work environment offences. The employer’s legal responsibility to <b>prevent</b> <b>stress</b> at work and injuries related to stress is thus, as a starting point, extensive. However, this responsibility is rarely demanded in legal practice. It has, for example, never yet occurred that an employer has been convicted of work environment offence for causing an employee stress related ill-health. This study deals with the employer's responsibility to <b>prevent</b> <b>stress</b> related ill-health and achieve a good psychosocial work environment from a broad legal perspective. The study covers the fundamental purposes and legal principles that permeate the regulation of the work environment and thereby affects the employer's responsibility to <b>prevent</b> <b>stress.</b> The requirements that the Work Environment Act impose on the employer through the rules concerning the state of the psychosocial work environment and the general preventive obligations are examined. Furthermore, the legal possibilities to demand responsibility for the psychosocial work environment according to the rules regarding co-operation, supervision and criminal responsibility are explored. The study demonstrates that the regulation is so vague in its design that the employer, in practice, is not given the possibility to achieve a clear understanding of what is required to <b>prevent</b> <b>stress</b> related ill-health. Therefore, introduction of clear binding provisions from the Work Environment Authority regarding the psychosocial work environment, to complement the general rules of the Work Environment Act, is proposed...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{deals with}} the issue of {{children}} and stress, and the impact that stress can have on children. The purpose has been to explore how I, in my role as teacher, can prevent children from developing stress in preschool, and how I can <b>prevent</b> <b>stress</b> to develop inside of my own department. My essay is structured as follows: First, I describe my practical work with children. Then I analyze some research literature on stress, and finally I reflect over what I have described earlier and try to connect the practical with the theoretical. In the practical part of this essay I describe the various events that I have observed during my work in preschool, where I have seen how stress can affect both children and teachers. Then I describe how the increasing size of children’s groups can create stress because of the noisy environment of the department. Moreover, I discuss how children are being negatively affected by their parents’ separation, and how we as teachers are performing under such circumstances. The questions I focus on are: How can we help both the children and ourselves to handle this problem? How can I as a teacher <b>prevent</b> <b>stress?</b> And what do scientists believe that stress is? By grounding these questions in the research literature I have expanded my understanding of what the definition of stress really means, and I have gained new insight about how teachers can <b>prevent</b> <b>stress</b> to develop in the preschool environment. In the reflection part of this essay I discuss the various symptoms that stress can cause according to the research literature and connect these theories with my practical work experience with children...|$|R
