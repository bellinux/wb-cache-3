5|$|York were relegated {{from the}} Second Division in 1998–99, after {{dropping}} into 21st {{place on the}} last day of the season. In December 2001, long-serving chairman Douglas Craig put the club and its ground up for sale for £4.5million, before announcing that the club would resign from the Football League if a buyer was not found. Motor racing driver John Batchelor took over the club in March 2002, and by December the club had gone into administration. The Supporters' Trust (ST) bought the club in March 2003 after an offer of £100,000 as payment for £160,000 owed in tax was accepted by the Inland Revenue. Batchelor left having diverted almost all of the £400,000 received from a sponsorship deal with <b>Persimmon</b> to his racing team, and having failed to deliver on his promise of having ST members on the board. York failed to win any of their final 20 league fixtures in 2003–04 and finished bottom of the Third Division. This meant the club was relegated to the Football Conference, ending 75 years of Football League membership.|$|E
5|$|York were {{relegated to}} the Conference National for 2004–05, which brought an end to 72 years of Football League {{football}} at Bootham Crescent. In January 2005 the ground was renamed KitKat Crescent, {{as part of a}} sponsorship deal under which Nestlé donated £100,000 to the club. This money went towards covering the shortfall the club faced paying BCH directors, <b>Persimmon</b> and stamp duty when buying the ground. The ground was still commonly referred to as Bootham Crescent. The deal expired in January 2010, when Nestlé ended all their sponsorship arrangements with the club. York returned to the Football League for 2012–13, and their first League Two match at Bootham Crescent was a 3–1 defeat to Wycombe Wanderers on 18 August 2012, before a 4,591 crowd. The club was {{relegated to the}} National League for 2016–17, ending a four-year spell back in the Football League. The ground has not been subject to any major investment since the 1990s, and has faced problems with holes in the Main Stand roof, crumbling in the Grosvenor Road End, drainage problems and toilet conditions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Persimmons</b> are eaten fresh, dried, raw, or cooked. When eaten fresh, {{they are}} usually eaten whole like an apple in bite-size slices, and may be peeled. One way to consume ripe <b>persimmons,</b> which may have soft texture, is to remove the top leaf with a paring knife and scoop out the flesh with a spoon. Riper <b>persimmons</b> can also be eaten by {{removing}} the top leaf, breaking the fruit in half, and eating from the inside out. The flesh ranges from firm to mushy, and the texture is unique. The flesh is sweet and, when firm owing to being unripe, possesses an apple-like crunch. American <b>persimmons</b> (Diospyros virginiana) and Diospyros digyna are completely inedible until they are fully ripe.|$|R

5|$|By mid February 2001, York were {{bottom of}} the Third Division table, but after losing only two of their last 16 matches they {{finished}} 2000–01 in 17th. They reached the FA Cup third round {{for the second time}} since 1986, but were beaten 3–0 by Premier League team Leicester City at Filbert Street. Record losses of £1,261,038 were reported in November 2001, before Craig announced in December that the club and the ground had been put up for sale for £4.5million. Craig later said Bootham Crescent would close by June 2002, and the club would resign from the Football League if a buyer was not found. The club was taken over by motor racing driver John Batchelor in March 2002. He pledged to give the Supporters' Trust (ST) two seats on the board and announced a sponsorship deal with <b>Persimmon</b> that would see an undisclosed amount split between the club and his racing team. By late March 2002, York were second from bottom, before a run of five wins from the last eight matches saw them finish 2001–02 in 14th place. They reached the FA Cup fourth round {{for the first time since}} 1986, losing 2–0 at home to Premier League team Fulham.|$|E
5|$|Dolan was {{dismissed}} in May 2003, the new board citing financial {{reasons for his}} departure. At 27 years, York player Chris Brass was appointed player-manager in June 2003, which made him the youngest Football League managerial appointment since 1946. The club's lease of Bootham Crescent was extended to May 2004, and plans proceeded to develop Huntington Stadium ahead of a possible move, but problems bringing the ground to Football League standards were encountered. The board preferred to stay at Bootham Crescent, and they bought the site in February 2004 {{after six months of}} negotiations. The deal came after York were lent £2million by The Football Stadia Improvement Fund (FSIF), with which they bought 75.89% of BCH shares and all of the 20,000 shares owned by <b>Persimmon.</b> Once plans for a new stadium were settled, the loan would be converted a grant to help fund the move. York equalled a club record by winning the first four matches of 2003–04, and by mid January 2004 were 10th in the table. They won none of their final 20 fixtures, garnering only five more points as they finished bottom of the Third Division. York were relegated to the Conference National after 75 years of Football League membership. Beck renounced his title of chairman in September 2004 because he favoured a more democratic approach for a fan-owned club. The board was restructured and Jason McGill became the managing director.|$|E
5|$|In July 1999, York's real {{property}} assets, including Bootham Crescent, {{were transferred to}} a holding company called Bootham Crescent Holdings (BCH) for £165,000. Chairman Douglas Craig put {{the ground and the}} club up for sale for £4.5million in December 2001. It was announced that the ground would close by 30 June 2002, and talks were held over a move to Huntington Stadium. In March 2002, the club was bought by John Batchelor; he said York could continue at Bootham Crescent until a new stadium was built, when in fact the previous 25-year lease was replaced with one that would expire in June 2003. Batchelor spoke of building a new stadium at Clifton Moor, and <b>Persimmon,</b> who held 10% of the shares in BCH, submitted planning applications for 93 homes on the site of Bootham Crescent. In March 2003, York extended their lease of the ground to May 2004, and under the ownership of the Supporters' Trust proceeded with plans to move to Huntington Stadium. Planning problems arose with bringing the ground up to Football League standards, and the club preferred to stay at Bootham Crescent. York bought Bootham Crescent in February 2004, after a £2million loan from the Football Stadia Improvement Fund (FSIF) was secured.|$|E

25|$|MD 191 was {{expanded}} to a divided highway from U.S. Route 240 (now MD 355) {{west to the}} Baltimore & Ohio Railroad railroad crossing (now the Capital Crescent Trail) by 1945. The railroad's bridge across the highway was in place by 1951. The divided highway was extended west to near Goldsboro Road by 1962. MD 191's bridges across I-495 were constructed in 1962 when the Beltway was under construction. The Bradley Boulevard bridge and its approaches were built as a divided highway. MD 191 and Eggert Drive were relocated {{at the site of}} the <b>Persimmon</b> Tree Road bridge and a cut-off county road was built to form a four-way intersection just north of the Beltway bridge. The state highway continued to follow the old alignment of <b>Persimmon</b> Tree Road (now <b>Persimmon</b> Tree Lane) instead of the cut-off until 1999. That year, MD 191 was truncated at MD 190 and the highway along <b>Persimmon</b> Tree Road and the portion of Bradley Boulevard west of MD 190 were transferred to Montgomery County maintenance in a highway swap.|$|E
