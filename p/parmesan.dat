5|$|Globally, Mozzarella is {{the most}} popular pizza cheese. However, it has been {{estimated}} that in the United States only 30% of all pizza cheese used is actual Mozzarella. Provolone is the second most popular one. Cheddar may be mixed with Mozzarella to preserve chewiness. Grated <b>Parmesan</b> may be added to the top of a pizza, and typically does not melt well when cooked. A diverse variety of processed pizza cheeses are produced, including analogue cheese. Provel is one example. Other pizza cheeses include Emmental, Romano and Ricotta for calzones or as a topping.|$|E

5|$|The legend that de' Medici {{introduced}} {{a long list}} of foods, techniques and utensils from Italy to France for the first time is a myth routinely discredited by most food historians. Items whose introduction to France have been attributed to Catherine include the dinner fork, parsley, the artichoke, lettuce, broccoli, the garden pea, pasta, <b>Parmesan,</b> as well as the turkey and tomato of the New World. She has also received credit for introducing sauces and a variety of dishes such as duck à l’orange and deviled eggs.|$|E
5|$|Pizza cheese {{encompasses}} several {{varieties and}} types of cheeses and dairy products that are designed and manufactured for use specifically on pizza. These include processed and modified cheese such as mozzarella-like processed cheeses and mozzarella variants. The term can also refer to any type of cheese suitable for use on pizza. The most popular cheeses used {{in the preparation of}} pizza are mozzarella (accounting for about 30%), provolone, cheddar and <b>Parmesan.</b> Emmental, Romano and ricotta are often used as toppings, and processed pizza cheeses manufactured specifically for pizza are mass-produced. Some mass-produced pizza cheeses are frozen after manufacturing and shipped frozen.|$|E
50|$|In 1771, {{two years}} after her arrival in Parma, Maria Amalia secured the {{dismissal}} of Du Tillot and replaced him with a Spanish appointee, Jose del Llano, who was highly recommended by the paternal uncle of Ferdinand, Charles III of Spain. In 1772, the year after, Maria Amalia fired Jose del Llano and replaced him with an Italian prime minister and a cabinet of native <b>Parmesans</b> loyal to her rather than a foreign ruler. As Ferdinand was of a passive nature and content with occupying himself with his religious duties and raising his children, he left the state affairs entirely to her, and after the cabinet change, Maria Amalia was therefore the ruler of Parma.|$|R
5000|$|The {{succession}} of Ferdinand I as grand master was disputed by the <b>Parmesans</b> {{who believed that}} the order was united to the ducal throne of Parma. In 1748, Charles III's younger brother Philip succeeded as duke of Parma; henceforth, his branch of the family regarded themselves as rightful successors to the grand magistry of the order. Philip's heir today is Carlos, Duke of Parma. See the historical note authored by Paolo Conforte, a senior officer of the Parma dynastic order. The view of the Bourbon-Sicily family is that the grand magistry was never united with the Two Sicilies Crown, but remained, {{in the words of}} Charles III 's son and successor, Ferdinand I, in a decree of 8 March 1796 [...] "In his (the King's) royal person there exists together two very distinct qualities, the one of Monarch of the Two Sicilies, and the other of Grand Master of the illustrious, royal and military Constantinian order, which though united gloriously in the same person form nonetheless at the same time two separate independent Lordships". It was this independence that enabled the order, whose grand magistry was held conjointly with the headship of the house of the Two Sicilies, to survive the abolition of the kingdom of the Two Sicilies in 1860.|$|R
6000|$|The <b>Parmesans</b> {{remember}} Maria Louisa, Napoleon's wife, with pleasant enough feelings, and {{she seems}} to have been good to them after the manner of sovereigns, enriching their city with art, and beautifying it in many ways, besides doing works of private charity and beneficence. Her daughter by a second marriage, the Countess Sanvitali, still lives in Parma; and in one of the halls of the Academy of Fine Arts the Duchess herself survives in the marble of Canova. It was she who caused the two great pictures of Correggio, the St. Jerome and the Madonna della Scodella, to be placed alone in separate apartments hung with silk, in which the painter's initial A is endlessly interwoven. [...] "The Night," [...] to which the St. Jerome is [...] "The Day," [...] is in the gallery at Dresden, but Parma could have kept nothing more representative of her great painter's power than this [...] "Day." [...] It is [...] "the bridal of the earth and sky," [...] and all sweetness, brightness, and tender shadow are in it. Many other excellent works of Correggio, Caracci, Parmigianino, and masters of different schools are in this gallery, but it is the good fortune of travellers, who have to see so much, that the memory of the very best alone distinctly remains. Nay, in the presence of prime beauty nothing else exists, and we found that the church of the Steccata, where Parmigianino's sublime [...] "Moses breaking the Tables of the Law" [...] is visible {{in the midst of a}} multitude of other figures on the vault, really contained nothing at last but that august and awful presence.|$|R
5|$|Cheese was {{far more}} {{important}} as a foodstuff, especially for common people, {{and it has been}} suggested that it was, during many periods, the chief supplier of animal protein among the lower classes. Many varieties of cheese eaten today, like Dutch Edam, Northern French Brie and Italian <b>Parmesan,</b> were available and well known in late medieval times. There were also whey cheeses, like ricotta, made from by-products of the production of harder cheeses. Cheese was used in cooking for pies and soups, the latter being common fare in German-speaking areas. Butter, another important dairy product, was in popular use in the regions of Northern Europe that specialized in cattle production in the latter half of the Middle Ages, the Low Countries and Southern Scandinavia. While most other regions used oil or lard as cooking fats, butter was the dominant cooking medium in these areas. Its production also allowed for a lucrative butter export from the 12th century onward.|$|E
5|$|In India, {{squashes}} (ghia) {{are cooked}} with seafood such as prawns. In France, marrows (courge) are traditionally {{served as a}} gratin, sieved and cooked with butter, milk, and egg, and flavored with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and as soups. In Italy, zucchini and larger squashes are served {{in a variety of}} regional dishes, such as cocuzze alla puviredda cooked with olive oil, salt and herbs from Puglia; as torta di zucca from Liguria, or torta di zucca e riso from Emilia-Romagna, the squashes being made into a pie filling with butter, ricotta, <b>parmesan,</b> egg, and milk; and as a sauce for pasta in dishes like spaghetti alle zucchine from Sicily. In Japan, squashes such as small C. moschata pumpkins (kabocha) are eaten boiled with sesame sauce, fried as a tempura dish, or made into balls with sweet potato and Japanese mountain yam.|$|E
5|$|Some {{versions}} may use mayonnaise, {{other types}} of cheese, such as pepper jack cheese, brie cheese or Cheddar cheese instead of cream cheese as primary ingredients. Some may incorporate other seafoods in addition to crab, such as imitation crab, lobster, shrimp and surimi. Additional ingredients may include mushrooms, artichoke, onion, green onion, shallot, green pepper, bread crumbs (such as panko), heavy cream and others. Bread crumbs {{may be used to}} top the dish, which may be browned during the cooking process creating a crust. Sometimes <b>Parmesan</b> cheese is combined with the bread crumbs. Some versions use Old Bay Seasoning as an ingredient to add flavor, and some are prepared spicy with the addition of ingredients such as hot sauce and red pepper.|$|E
60|$|All Parma {{is full of}} Correggio, as Venice is of Titian and Tintoretto, as Naples of Spagnoletto, as Mantua of Giulio Romano, as Vicenza of Palladio, as Bassano of Da Ponte, as Bologna of Guido Reni. I have {{elsewhere}} {{noticed how}} ineffaceably and exclusively {{the manner of the}} masters seems to have stamped itself upon the art of the cities where they severally wrought,--how at Parma Correggio yet lives in all the sketchy mouths of all the pictures painted there since his time. One might almost believe, hearing the <b>Parmesans</b> talk, that his manner had infected their dialect, and that they fashioned their lazy, incomplete utterance with the careless lips of his nymphs and angels. They almost entirely suppress the last syllable of every word, and not with a quick precision, as people do in Venice or Milan, but with an ineffable languor, as if language were not worth the effort of enunciation; while they rise and lapse several times in each sentence, and sink so sweetly and sadly away upon the closing vocable that the listener can scarcely repress his tears. In this melancholy rhythm, one of the citizens recounted to me the whole story of the assassination of the last Duke of Parma in 1850; and left me as softly moved as if I had been listening to a tale of hapless love. Yet it was an ugly story, and after the enchantment of the recital passed away, I perceived that when the Duke was killed justice was done on one of the maddest and wickedest tyrants that ever harassed an unhappy city.|$|R

At this, all the Bourbon courts turned against the Holy See, demanding the entire dissolution of the Jesuits. Parma expelled the Jesuits from its territories, confiscating their possessions.|$|E
25|$|While {{versions}} are made commercially elsewhere, Cotija cheese {{is made in}} Cotija, Tocumbo and Los Reyes in Michoacán and Quitupan, Santa María del Oro and Jilotlán de los Dolores in Jalisco. These communities are in the Sierra de Jal-Mich region, which straddles the two states. To receive this recognition, the cheese must also be made with pasteurized milk to prevent food-borne illness. This goat cheese was developed in Mexico entirely and has a taste and texture {{similar to that of}} Italian <b>parmesan.</b> It has a light golden hue and pronounced sour-milk aroma. It is aged an average of 12 months and sometimes the wheels are covered in a chili pepper paste to prevent mold. It is usually sprinkled on dishes as an accent, but can be used to flavor pastas and salads. This cheese is also popular in the United States, where it is both imported and made domestically. However, the US-made Cotija differs noticeable from its Mexican namesake, as American producers add enzymes to speed up the aging process.|$|E
25|$|Inventory credit {{refers to}} the use of stock, or inventory, as {{collateral}} to raise finance. Where banks may be reluctant to accept traditional collateral, for example in developing countries where land title may be lacking, inventory credit is a potentially important way of overcoming financing constraints. This is not a new concept; archaeological evidence suggests that it was practiced in Ancient Rome. Obtaining finance against stocks {{of a wide range of}} products held in a bonded warehouse is common in much of the world. It is, for example, used with <b>Parmesan</b> cheese in Italy. Inventory credit on the basis of stored agricultural produce is widely used in Latin American countries and in some Asian countries. A precondition for such credit is that banks must be confident that the stored product will be available if they need to call on the collateral; this implies the existence of a reliable network of certified warehouses. Banks also face problems in valuing the inventory. The possibility of sudden falls in commodity prices means that they are usually reluctant to lend more than about 60% of the value of the inventory at the time of the loan.|$|E
