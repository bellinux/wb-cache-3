50|$|A recent {{intracranial}} electrocorticography {{study shows}} that the activity in the VWFA goes through multiple stages of processing. Using classification with direct neural recordings from the VWFA, Hirshorn et al. showed that early VWFA activity, from approximately 100-250 milliseconds after reading a word, {{is consistent with a}} pre-lexical representation and later activity, from approximately 300-500 milliseconds is consistent with a lexical representation. These results potentially mediate between the pre-lexical and lexical hypotheses by showing that both levels of representation may be seen in the VWFA, but at different latencies after reading a word. <b>Previous</b> <b>studies</b> <b>using</b> <b>fMRI</b> did not have the temporal resolution to differentiate between these two stages.|$|R
40|$|<b>Previous</b> <b>studies</b> <b>using</b> <b>fMRI</b> {{have found}} that the Fusiform Face Area (FFA) {{responds}} selectively to face stimuli. More recently however, studies have shown that FFA activation is not face-specific, but can also occur for other objects if the level of experience with the objects is controlled. Our neurocomputational models of visual expertise suggest that the FFA may perform fine-level discrimination by amplifying small differences in visually homogeneous categories. This is reflected in a large spread of the stimuli in the highdimensional representational space. This view of the FFA as a general, fine-level discriminator has been disputed on a number of counts. It has been argued that the objects used in human and network expertise studies (e. g. cars, birds, Greebles) are too “face-like ” to conclude that the FFA is a general-purpose processor. Further, in our previous models, novice networks had fewer output possibilities than expert networks, leaving open the possibility that learning more discriminations, rather than learning fine-level discriminations, may be responsible for the results. To challenge these criticisms, we trained networks to perform fine-level discrimination on fonts, an obviously non-face category, and showed that these font networks learn a new task faster than networks trained to identify letters. In addition, all networks had the same number of output options, illustrating that visual expertise does not rely on number of discriminations, but rather on how the representational space is partitioned...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} changes in cortical oxygenation during mental arithmetic using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Twenty-nine male volunteers were examined using a 52 -channel continuous wave system for analyzing activity in prefrontal areas. With {{the help of}} a probabilistic mapping method, three regions of interest (ROIs) on each hemisphere were defined: The inferior frontal gyri (IFG), the middle frontal gyri (MFG), and the superior frontal gyri (SFG). Oxygenation as an indicator of functional brain activation was compared over the three ROI and two levels of arithmetic task difficulty (simple and complex additions). In contrast to most <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> <b>using</b> <b>fMRI</b> or NIRS, in the present study arithmetic tasks were presented verbally in analogue to many daily life situations. With respect to task difficulty, more complex addition tasks led to higher oxygenation in all defined ROI except in the left IFG compared to simple addition tasks. When compared to the channel positions covering different gyri of the temporal lobe, the observed sensitivity to task complexity was found to be restricted to the specified ROIs. As to the comparison of ROIs, the highest oxygenation was found in the IFG, while MFG and SFG showed significantly less activation compared to IFG. The present cognitive-neuroscience approach demonstrated that NIRS is a suitable and highly feasible research tool for investigating and quantifying neural effects of increasing arithmetic task difficulty...|$|R

Participants practiced the peg transfer task for 10 blocks of 3 trials while receiving either of four stimulation protocols: anodal tDCS applied over left M 1, anodal tDCS applied over right M 1, anodal tDCS applied over SMA area, or sham tDCS. Participants performed 1 block of 3 trials on a second day as retention. The task completion time was recorded for each trial as performance measure. Although the task completion time significantly decreased across the training blocks in all groups, no significant difference between stimulation protocols was observed during both learning and retention, suggesting anodal tDCS over left M 1, right M 1, or SMA does not improve learning of the laparoscopic surgery task...|$|R

Results showed that musical training was associated with increased RSFC within the networks for multiple cognitive functions (such as vision, phonology, semantics, auditory encoding, and executive functions).

We therefore wanted to characterize cortical function during natural viewing conditions, especially {{to determine the}} degree to which distinct cortical regions are differentially involved in the processing of distinct features. In a <b>previous</b> <b>study,</b> we <b>used</b> <b>fMRI</b> data from 8 human volunteers who freely viewed the first 25 min of a James Bond movie, and showed that the intensity variation over time of high-level features (faces, human bodies, language and color) as judged offline by separate human observers correlated linearly with the BOLD signal of specialized, partially segregated cortical regions (Bartels and Zeki, 2004 a). To complement the <b>previous</b> <b>study,</b> here we <b>used</b> a computational analysis of the movie to determine the intensities of low-level features over time. These included global and local motion flow-fields, frame-by-frame pixel errors, contrast, luminance and color saturation. Parallel to our previous findings, our results showed that partially segregated regions of the visual system correlated with distinct low-level features, in accord with their preferences known from controlled experiments. The results also complement our findings from an independent component analysis of the same dataset (Bartels and Zeki, 2004 b), in which a multitude of distinct cortical regions was segregated without a-priori hypotheses about their function, based entirely on their differential and specific functional response to the movie over time. In conjunction with our previous findings we conclude that during processing of dynamic, complex natural scenes distinct regions of the visual brain maintain a high degree of functional preference for distinct visual features...|$|R
40|$|<b>Previous</b> <b>studies</b> have <b>used</b> <b>fMRI</b> {{to address}} the {{relationship}} between grip force (GF) applied to an object and BOLD response. However, whilst {{the majority of these}} studies showed a linear relationship between GF and neural activity in the contralateral M 1 and ipsilateral cerebellum, animal studies have suggested the presence of non-linear components in the GF–neural activity relationship. Here, we present a methodology for assessing non-linearities in the BOLD response to different GF levels, within primary motor as well as sensory and cognitive areas and the cerebellum. To be sensitive to complex forms, we designed a feasible grip task with five GF targets using an event-related visually guided paradigm and studied a cohort of 13 healthy volunteers. Polynomial functions of increasing order were fitted to the data. Major findings: (1) activated motor areas irrespective of GF; (2) positive higher-order responses in and outside M 1, involving premotor, sensory and visual areas and cerebellum; (3) negative correlations with GF, predominantly involving the visual domain. Overall, our results suggest that there are physiologically consistent behaviour patterns in cerebral and cerebellar cortices; for example, we observed the presence of a second-order effect in sensorimotor areas, consistent with an optimum metabolic response at intermediate GF levels, while higher-order behaviour was found in associative and cognitive areas. At higher GF levels, sensory-related cortical areas showed reduced activation, interpretable as a redistribution of the neural activity for more demanding tasks. These results have the potential of opening new avenues for investigating pathological mechanisms of neurological diseases...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown that gradient-echo blood oxygen level {{dependent}} (BOLD) fMRI is biased toward large draining veins. However, the impact of this large vein bias on the localization and characterization of semantic category areas has not been examined. Here we address this issue by comparing standard magnitude measures of BOLD activity in the Fusiform Face Area (FFA) and Parahippocampal Place Area (PPA) to those obtained using a novel method that suppresses the contribution of large draining veins: source-localized phase regressor (sPR). Unlike previous suppression methods that utilize the phase component of the BOLD signal, sPR yields robust and unbiased suppression of large draining veins even in voxels with no task-related phase changes. This is confirmed in ideal simulated data as well as in FFA/PPA localization data from four subjects. It was found that approximately 38 % of right PPA, 14 % of left PPA, 16 % of right FFA, and 6 % of left FFA voxels predominantly reflect signal from large draining veins. Surprisingly, with the contributions from large veins suppressed, semantic category representation in PPA actually tends to be lateralized to the left rather than the right hemisphere. Furthermore semantic category areas larger in volume and higher in fSNR were found to have more contributions from large veins. These results suggest that <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> <b>using</b> gradient-echo BOLD <b>fMRI</b> were biased toward semantic category areas that receive relatively greater contributions from large veins...|$|R
