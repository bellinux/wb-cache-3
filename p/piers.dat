5|$|The land now {{occupied}} by Lyme Park was granted to <b>Piers</b> Legh {{and his wife}} Margaret D'anyers, by letters patent dated January 4, 1398, by RichardII, son of the Black Prince. Margaret D'anyers' grandfather, Sir Thomas D'anyers, had taken part in retrieving the standard of the Black Prince at the Battle of Crécy in 1346, and was rewarded with annuity of 40 marks a year by the Black Prince, drawn on his Cheshire estate, and which could be exchanged for land of that value belonging to the Black Prince. Sir Thomas died in 1354, and the annuity passed to his nearest surviving kin, his granddaughter Margaret, who in 1388 married the first <b>Piers</b> Legh (<b>Piers</b> LeghI).

The organism which create biologic sewage is bio fouling. On the pole <b>pier,</b> there are many organism such as Balanus sp. The organism that attach on the substrate is not only on natural substrate but also on means of human interest e. g. boat and coastal building like <b>pier.</b> This research was especially for microscopic bio fouling (macro fouling) that attach by massively on the pole dock. 	The objectives {{of this research is}} to know the density of macro fouling, diversity of macro fouling, comparing the density of macro fouling that attach on the concrete <b>pier</b> and wood <b>pier</b> in Ballang Lompo Island, Mattiro Sompe Sub-District, Pangkajene dan Kepulauan District This research showed the density macro fouling value on the pole wood <b>pier</b> and concrete <b>pier</b> commonly dominated by Balanus sp.

5|$|After the 1903 {{destruction}} of the original wooden bridge at Belvidere, plans to construct another bridge started immediately. After the storm, the substructure of the crossing had survived the strong storm. The bridge corporation set a completion date, August 17, 1904, which was {{the day that the}} Farmer's Picnic was held in Belvidere. However, the contractor of which they hired to reconstruct the bridge, the New Jersey Bridge Company of Manasquan, New Jersey, believed that the new bridge would need new abutments and <b>piers</b> to be completed by that time, instead of using the old wooden bridge's <b>piers.</b> The three <b>piers</b> from the wooden bridge were used, and would require them to be heightened to be above any high flood waters. On June 3, 1904, the bridge construction began on a barge in the river, with promises to be complete by the set date of August 17. On August 17, the bridge was not complete, but usable, that when the Farmer's Picnic (the predecessor to the Warren County Fair, occurred, people were allowed to cross a majority of the bridge. The picnic itself was a complete success, attracting over 15,000 people, most of which walked the bridge.|$|E

5000|$|After the Japanese {{bombing of}} Pearl Harbor in 1941, Huntington Beach, {{along with many}} other coastal cities, became {{involved}} in the World War II effort. The U.S. navy took over the <b>pier</b> for military use by installing a submarine lookout post at the end along with a heavy caliber machine gun. When the war was over, all military equipment was removed and the <b>pier</b> was returned to the citizens. The <b>pier</b> did not face any trouble for the next four decades, until 1983 when another storm destroyed the end of the <b>pier</b> and End Cafe again, and once again in 1988 after another reconstruction. That year, a company called Fluor/Daniel Consultants of Irvine conducted a study on the structural stability of the <b>pier</b> and as a result, the <b>pier</b> was declared unsafe and was closed in July of that year. In an effort to raise funds to rebuild the <b>pier,</b> a group of citizens formed an organization called <b>P.I.E.R.</b> (Persons Interested in Expediting Reconstruction). The organization raised over $100,000 by selling T-shirts and other merchandise with the <b>P.I.E.R.</b> logo. Another $92,000 was donated by the people of Anjo, Japan, one of Huntington Beach's sister cities. With this money, construction of a new <b>pier</b> began in October 1990.The <b>pier</b> was completed and opened on July 18, 1992 at 1,856 ft in length.
