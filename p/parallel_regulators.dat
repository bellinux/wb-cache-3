40|$|Since the 1980 s, {{oversight}} of punishment {{in the federal}} criminal system has been centralized. A single body, the Sentencing Commission, regulates criminal punishment through the Sentencing Guidelines. The Guidelines are designed to bring consistency and transparency to criminal punishment, but come with the inevitable cost of a loss of case-by-case judicial discretion. In contrast, punishment in the federal administrative state is almost completely decentralized. No single body oversees agency punishment practices. The administrative model makes the opposite choice of the criminal model. It favors individualized punishment determinations over the benefits of consistency and transparency. In this Essay, I consider the {{arguments in favor of}} a sentencing commission for the administrative state. I conclude that although the advantages of centralized punishment are real, they are not large enough to support centralizing the administrative civil penalty power into a single body. Administrative enforcement involves a level of specialized knowledge and integration with other agency regulatory choices that is absent in the criminal context. However, while a top-down approach enforcing penalty consistency and transparency would be a mistake, agencies can and should work from the bottom up to develop their own penalty guidelines and coordinate their penalty practices with <b>parallel</b> <b>regulators...</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} article addresses {{the evaluation of}} power conversion on heavy payload tethered hexarotors where the payloads are high and hovering times are long. Modifications {{were added to the}} power conversion unit based on operation reliability perspective. Since the objective power conversion is large comparing to existing tethered UAVs today, a strategic engineering approach was proposed and tested based on partial observations on current spikes and power thresholds of DCDC switching regulators. Research problem is such that, when UAV motors are consuming low currents, the current spikes are not the plausible cause of direct power failure. But at higher currents even small current spikes could cause power failures. Risk increase with time and situations worsen when UAVs operate under high precision flight controls. When the number of parallel converters are small this becomes a mission critical problem. As a solution, fast switching high current diodes are used at the low voltage high current output to block reverse currents, and then apply low voltage bus bar to prevent dependency issues on particular DCDC module. At the cost of a small power dissipations over diodes, the total current thresholds of UAV become higher.

40|$|Expression {{of genes}} of {{the locus of}} {{enterocyte}} effacement (LEE) is essential for adherence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) to intestinal epithelial cells. Gut factors that may modulate LEE gene expression may therefore influence {{the outcome of the}} infection. Because nitric oxide (NO) is a critical effector of the intestinal immune response that may induce transcriptional regulation in enterobacteria, we investigated its influence on LEE expression in EHEC O 157 :H 7. We demonstrate that NO inhibits the expression of genes belonging to LEE 1, LEE 4, and LEE 5 operons, and that the NO sensor nitrite-sensitive repressor (NsrR) is a positive regulator of these operons by interacting directly with the RNA polymerase complex. In the presence of NO, NsrR detaches from the LEE 1 / 4 / 5 promoter regions and does not activate transcription. In <b>parallel,</b> two <b>regulators</b> of the acid resistance pathway, GadE and GadX, are induced by NO through an indirect NsrR-dependent mechanism. In this context, we show that the NO-dependent LEE 1 down-regulation is due to absence of NsrR-mediated activation and to the repressor effect of GadX. Moreover, the inhibition of expression of LEE 4 and LEE 5 by NO is due to loss of NsrR-mediated activation, to LEE 1 down-regulation and to GadE up-regulation. Lastly, we establish that chemical or cellular sources of NO inhibit the adherence of EHEC to human intestinal epithelial cells.

40|$|In many {{countries}} worldwide access networks {{are in the}} transition from copper to fiber access. During the transition phase copper and fiber networks are operated in <b>parallel.</b> All <b>regulators</b> facing this situation of technological change have {{to decide how to}} price unbundled access to the copper loop in this transition phase. Should they keep the usual forward looking long-run incremental cost standard charge, or should they move to some different approach? The authors propose to price copper access based on the modern equivalent asset (MEA) of fiber access. Since fiber access is superior to copper access, the cost of fiber access (as a basis for pricing copper access) should, however, be corrected by the performance delta between copper and fiber access. Instead of using quality of service (QoS) differences, the authors determine the performance delta based on the market valuation of services provided over the copper and fiber access represented by the end-user prices of services and corrected by cost differences downstream of the access provision. Under this approach an access seeker becomes indifferent (on the margin) between using the copper or the fiber access network and wholesale pricing (or regulation) becomes competitively neutral towards technology choice between copper and fiber access and does not distort the platform competition towards cable. To test its practicability numerical simulations of the approach are performed by means of a quantitative competition model. The model analysis suggests that the approach leads to unique and robust results. Its main conclusion is that the method tends to be conservative relative to the theoretical case of pure vertical product differentiation, meaning that the measured performance delta underestimates the theoretical performance delta...|$|R
40|$|In {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the {{transcription}} factor Yap 1 p {{is a central}} determinant of resistance to oxidative stress. Previous work has demonstrated that Yap 1 p is recruited from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon exposure to the oxidants diamide and H 2 O 2 {{in a process that}} requires the transient covalent linkage of the glutathione peroxidase Gpx 3 p to Yap 1 p. Genetic and biochemical analyses indicate that while both oxidants trigger nuclear accumulation of Yap 1 p, the function and regulation of this transcription factor is different under these two different oxidative stresses. Ybp 1 p (Yap 1 p-binding protein) has recently been demonstrated to be required for Yap 1 p-mediated H 2 O 2 resistance but not diamide resistance. A Ybp 1 p homologous protein (Ybh 1 p/Ybp 2 p) was also detected in the S. cerevisiae genome. Here we compare the actions of these two closely related proteins and provide evidence that while both factors influence H 2 O 2 tolerance, they do so by nonidentical mechanisms. A double mutant strain lacking both YBP 1 and YBH 1 genes is more sensitive to H 2 O 2 and more defective in activation of Yap 1 p-dependent gene expression than either single mutant. Ybp 1 p has a more pronounced effect on these phenotypes than does Ybh 1 p. Protein-protein interactions between Yap 1 p and Ybp 1 p could be detected by either the yeast two-hybrid or coimmunoprecipitation approach while neither technique could demonstrate Yap 1 p-Ybh 1 p interactions. Overexpression experiments indicated that high levels of Ybh 1 p but not Ybp 1 p could bypass the H 2 O 2 hypersensitivity of a gpx 3 Δ strain. Together, these data argue that these two homologous proteins act as <b>parallel</b> positive <b>regulators</b> of H 2 O 2 tolerance...|$|R

40|$|Autophagy is an {{important}} stress response pathway responsible for the removal and recycling of damaged or redundant cytosolic constituents. Mitochondrial damage triggers selective mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), mediated {{by a variety of}} response factors including the Pink 1 /Parkin system. Using human retinal pigment epithelial cells stably expressing autophagy and mitophagy reporters, we have conducted <b>parallel</b> screens of <b>regulators</b> of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial morphology and function contributing to starvation-induced autophagy and damage-induced mitophagy. These screens identified the ER chaperone and Ca 2 + flux modulator, sigma non-opioid intracellular receptor 1 (SIGMAR 1), as a regulator of autophagosome expansion during starvation. Screens also identified phosphatidyl ethanolamine methyl transferase (PEMT) and the IP 3 -receptors (IP 3 Rs) as mediators of Parkin-induced mitophagy. Further experiments suggested that IP 3 R-mediated transfer of Ca 2 + from the ER lumen to the mitochondrial matrix via the mitochondrial Ca 2 + uniporter (MCU) primes mitochondria for mitophagy. Importantly, recruitment of Parkin to damaged mitochondria did not require IP 3 R-mediated ER-to-mitochondrial Ca 2 + transfer, but mitochondrial clustering downstream of Parkin recruitment was impaired, suggesting involvement of regulators of mitochondrial dynamics and/or transport. Our data suggest that Ca 2 + flux between ER and mitochondria at presumed ER/mitochondrial contact sites is needed both for starvation-induced autophagy and for Parkin-mediated mitophagy, further highlighting the importance of inter-organellar communication for effective cellular homeostasis...|$|R
40|$|Regulation of gene {{expression}} in the human pathogen Neisseria meningitidis remains poorly understood. The meningococcus is a good model for a global analysis of transcriptional regulation as it has fewer transcriptional regulators and proteins able to modulate {{gene expression}} compared to other species with genomes of similar size. The genes encoding proteins predicted to modulate transcription in the meningococcus were identified using a dedicated database for systematical functional analysis (NeMeSys) in this species and mutated by utilising an improved in vitro transposon mutagenesis system. The resulting mutants were subjected to phenotypic analysis for growth and functions linked {{to one of the}} major virulence factors of the meningococcus, Type-four pili (Tfp). Tfp are essential for adhesion, aggregation, twitching motility and DNA competence in pathogenic Neisseria species. However, not much is known about the expression of the 16 proteins essential for Tfp biogenesis, and the seven proteins playing important roles in Tfp biology. The mutants were assessed for the Tfp-dependent phenotypes: aggregation, adhesion to human cells and twitching motility. No mutants were found to be dramatically impaired for these properties. However, two transcriptional regulators, HexR (NMV_ 1005) and FarR (NMV_ 2033), were found to influence the aggregative abilities of the meningococcus, with mutations in these genes resulting in a slow aggregating, and consequently, slow adhering phenotype. In <b>parallel,</b> two transcriptional <b>regulators</b> were chosen for further characterisation because they are encoded on genomic islands absent in the nonpathogenic Neisseria strain, Neisseria lactamica and could thus contribute to virulence.

Author Summary Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O 157 :H 7 are food-borne pathogens for humans causing bloody diarrhea and, especially in children under five years old, kidney damages leading to death in 5 % of cases. Antibiotics are contra-indicated because they are suspected to increase the severity of the disease. Therefore, it is crucial to develop alternative preventive or therapeutic strategies to fight EHEC infection. To reach this goal, a deeper knowledge of host-pathogen interaction is required. A critical step in EHEC infection is the adhesion of bacterial cells to intestinal epithelial cells. In response to the bacterial infection, the host triggers an immune response directed against the pathogen. The current study shows that a main effector of this immune response, nitric oxide (NO), dramatically reduces the capacity of EHEC to adhere to intestinal epithelial cells. We have investigated the molecular mechanisms involved and identified a NO-sensor regulator that controls the expression of the genes required for EHEC adhesion. This finding underlines that NO could be a potential protective factor limiting the development of EHEC-induced diseases and provides a new avenue of investigation for the development of therapeutic strategies against infections with O 157 :H 7 bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Cis -regulatory DNA encodes the {{circuitry}} {{that enables}} cell development and differentiation. Cis -regulatory DNA is densely populated by recogntition sequences for transcription factors and the cooperative binding TFs to these sequences determines cell-fate and function by the precise transcriptional regulation of their cognate genes. As such, a mechanistic understanding of gene regulation hinges on {{our ability to}} quantify transcription factor occupancy. To map transcription factor occupancy with in the human genome, I {{took part in the}} development of digital genomic footprinting [...] a technique leveraging the endonuclease DNase I that enables the unbiased and simultaneous detection of transcription factor occupancy genome-wide. We applied digital genomic footprinting to 41 diverse cell- and tissue-types to comprehensively map the human cis -regulatory lexicon. We show that this small genomic compartment contains an expansive repertoire of conserved recognition sequences for DNA-binding proteins and that nuclease patterns within these sequences mirror nucleotide-level evolutionary conservation and track the crystallographic topography of protein-DNA interfaces. We also show that both genetic and epigenetic variants affecting chromatin states are concentrated within footprints. Finally, we describe a large collection of novel regulatory factor recognition motifs that are highly conserved in both sequence and function, and exhibit cell-selective occupancy patterns that closely <b>parallel</b> major <b>regulators</b> of development, differentiation and pluripotency. These results provide for the first time an exhaustive map of TF occupancy within the human genome. The architecture of individual cis -regulatory sites is critical for their function. While digital genomic footprinting provides rich information about the occupancy of TFs within individual cis -regulatory elements, it is currently not possible to resolve the genome-wide relationship of transcription factors (TFs) and nucleosomes. To address this deficiency, I developed an extension to digital genomic footprinting that couples the detection of individual TF footprints to nucleosome occupancy. We find that TF occupancy is the major determinant of the positioning of cis -regulatory proximal nucleosomes, and that the positioning and occupancy of promoter-associated nucloeosomes is related to transcriptional start sites selection and output. The approach we describe provides a new view on the structure of cis -regulatory chromatin. In the second part of this thesis, I used a comparative genomics approach to study the evolution of cis -regulatory DNA and protein occupancy. To do this, I mapped DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) in 45 mouse cell types and primary tissues, and systematically compared these with human DHS maps from orthologous cell and tissue compartments. While I uncovered a small set of core regulatory sequences that encode a developmental program, the vast majority of cis -regulatory DNA is rapidly evolving independently in mouse and human. Overall, I find that the activity of cis -regulatory DNA is directly linked to the the composition of TF recognition sequences within and that the aggregate recognition sequence space for each transcription factor within accessible regulatory DNA of orthologous mouse and human cell types has been strictly conserved. These results demonstrate the remarkable plasticity of the mammalian cis -regulatory program and that TF occupancy is driven by an evolutionary inflexible trans -environment rather than conservation of individual regulatory elements. Taken together, this thesis provides a framework to understand the organization and evolution of global TF occupancy within the mammalian genome...|$|R
40|$|Cell {{death is}} {{prevalent}} in animal development, homeostasis, and disease. While apoptotic cell death {{has been extensively}} studied, many dying cells in development do not exhibit apoptotic morphology, and mice lacking core apoptotic regulators have mostly normal rates of developmental programmed cell death. However, {{little is known about}} how alternative death programs are set in motion. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, most cells fated to die by apoptosis are eliminated as young, undifferentiated cells, for no obvious functional reasons. The male nematode’s linker cell, in contrast, dies as an older, differentiated cell, whose life and death subserve precise and important functions. The linker cell first undertakes a long migration along a characteristic path, elongating the male gonad into its proper, mature shape. Once the gonad has attained its final shape and the linker cell has completed its migration, the linker cell then dies to connect the gonad to the environment and allow male fertility. Linker cell death is genetically and morphologically non-apoptotic. Instead, this death program requires the temporal regulator LIN- 29, the SARM-like protein TIR- 1, the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) SEK- 1, and the glutamine-rich protein PQN- 41. SARM and MAPKKs have been implicated in non-apoptotic degeneration of axon distal segments following axotomy, and some developmental and pathological cell death events in vertebrates resemble the morphology of the dying linker cell. Thus, the molecular mechanism governing linker cell death may be conserved; however, neither the initiating death signals nor the target/s of linker cell death regulators are known. Using classical genetics, I have investigated the initiating mechanisms of linker cell death. I have characterized the cell-autonomous involvement of a histone 3, lysine 4 methyltransferase complex centered on the Trithorax/MLL-like catalytic subunit SET- 16. I then demonstrated that two opposing spatial cues, the Wnt ligands EGL- 20 and LIN- 44, cooperate with LIN- 29 to control linker cell death initiation. I showed that the Abdominal- B-like Hox transcription factor NOB- 1 likely acts upstream of these two Wnt pathways, and that the Tailless/Tlx nuclear hormone receptor NHR- 67 acts in <b>parallel</b> to these <b>regulators</b> to promote linker cell death in addition to linker cell migration. Finally, I show that the Wnt pathways and all known linker cell death mediators require the heat shock factor HSF- 1 for cell death. Importantly, HSF- 1 function in linker cell death is distinct from, and competes with, its role in stress responses. My studies demonstrate that HSF- 1, previously thought to be primarily protective, is a key downstream regulator of a nonapoptotic cell death program. I have also developed a method to isolate large numbers of linker cells from staged worms populations, to enable a comprehensive characterization of the transcriptional program driving linker cell death...|$|R

Gazların özgül hacimlerinin küçültülmesi ise basınçlandırılarak ya da sıvılaştırılarak yapılabilir. Günümüzde doğal gazın taşınabilmesi için kullanılan iki ana metod vardır. Bunlar sıvılaştırılmış doğal gaz (LNG) ve yüksek basınç altında boru hattı ile taşıma metodlarıdır. Sıvılaştırılmış doğal gaz metodu boru hattının olmadığı yerlerde ve deniz aşırı taşımalarda kullanılır. Boru hatları ile taşıma metodu ise genellikle karasal alanda yapılmasına rağmen, zaman zaman denizaltından da yapılmaktadır. Uzun mesafe taşıma metodu her ne olursa olsun tüketiciye temin edilecek doğal gaz, düşük basınçlı şehir içi doğal gaz dağıtım hatlarıyla yapılır. Ülkemizde üretilen ve ithal edilen doğal gaz, BOTAŞ iletim şebekesi vasıtasıyla 50 – 75 bar basınç altında şehir giriş istasyonları olarak tanımladığımız RMS-A tipi istasyonlarda 18 – 25 bar basınca düşürülerek şehir doğal gaz dağıtım şebekesine ulaştırılır. Bu istasyonlarda yaklaşık 50 bar basınç düşürme işlemi, kullanılabilir enerjiyi üretmeden gerçekleşir. Bu problem termodinamik açıdan incelendiğinde, klasik basınç düşürme işlemleri yerine genleşme türbini (turbo-expander) kullanarak elektrik üretiminin yapılmasını, hatta küçük ölçekli sıvılaştırılmış doğal gaz (LNG) ünitesinin çalıştırılmasını mümkün kılabilir. Genleşme türbini vasıtasıyla elektrik üretimi, enerji kaynaklarının kısıtlılığı ve çevresel değerler dikkate alındığında hızla önem kazanmaktadır. Bu yolla yapılacak sistemin kapasitesi, giriş basıncı, giriş sıcaklığı, debi ve çıkış basıncına bağlı olarak birkaç yüz kW’dan birkaç MW’a kadar değişebilir. Bu konuda Amerika, İngiltere, İtalya, Çekoslovakya ve Rusya gibi ülkelerde çeşitli çalışmalar ve araştırma amaçlı uygulamalar yapılmıştır. San Diego (California), Memphis (Tennessee) ve Hamilton (New Jersey) ilk uygulamalar arasındadır, (Bloach ve Soares, 2001). Bu teknolojinin, Türkiye’deki iletim ve dağıtım sisteminin ve ekonomik koşullarının dikkate alınarak kullanılması durumunda potansiyel elektrik üretimi ve bir kazanç elde edilebileceği analizi bu çalışmanın temelini oluşturmaktadır. Specific {{volume of}} gas {{has to be}} {{decreased}} in order to transmit it with more economical way as well as diminishing energy consumption. Specific volume of gas can be reduced with liquefaction or compression. Currently, {{there are two different}} methods to transmit natural gas. These methods are liquefied natural gas (LNG) and transmission through pipeline under high pressure. Liquefied natural gas method is used in locations {{in which there is no}} available pipeline or overseas transportations. Transmission with pipelines is mostly constructed at terrestrial zones, although submarine pipeline implementations are rarely needed. No matter what the long distance transmission method is, natural gas for the end user must be distributed through low pressure inner-city pipelines. The natural gas produced domestically or being imported by licensed governmental/private companies is transmitted to local gas distribution network by reducing the high pressures from 50 - 75 bar to moderate pressures 18 - 25 bar at city gate stations, so called RMS-A. This approximately 50 bar pressure reduction process is carried out via regulator at the RMS-A type stations without recovering useful energy. If the problem is analyzed with respect to thermodynamic principles, the power generation by operating a turbo expander or a small scale LNG unit is possible to reduce line pressure without using or along with conventional regulators. It should not be forgotten that the turbo expander system is installed <b>parallel</b> to <b>regulator</b> system and will operate between the predetermined design flow rates. Power generation through an expansion turbine comes into prominence quickly when considering limited energy sources and environmental concerns. The capacity of this kind of power generation system may vary from a few hundred kW to several MW depending on the system design parameters such as inlet and outlet pressures, inlet and outlet temperatures, mass flow rate, and system efficiency, thermodynamic properties of natural gas, etc. Some applications on power generation issue including research oriented works have been carried out in the USA, England, Italy, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Russia, Iran, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Early applications of turbo expander systems are performed in San Diego (California), Memphis (Tennessee), Hamilton (New Jersey), (Bloach and Soares, 2001). Nowadays, widespread application of turbo expanders is very common all around the World, (Bloach ve Soares, 2001). The main objective of this study is to determine and demonstrate the potential profitability of power generation from turbo expanders if this technology is used in RMS-A stations in Turkey. Annual data representing year 2013 from Çorlu, Kayseri and Yalova RMS-A stations have been used for designing power generation system to achieve the goal in each aforementioned city-gate stations. The tabulated raw data was processed using Excel spreadsheet program to determine maximum and minimum volumetric flow rates in hourly basis. Then, the data in hourly basis was converted into monthly and annually bases. Afterwards, design flow rate of turbo expander that could be operated at various volumetric flow rates was initially determined using the annual consumption rate. The variable operation rate of turbine is selected to be in the range of 50 % higher and 40 % lower than the design flow rate as informed by a manufacturer. Applying this preselected variable flow rates of turbo expander to raw data, net operating period of turbine in terms of hours per year were determined for the each examined RMS-A stations. The main components of the turbo expander system are turbine, gear box and generator, and boiler and heat exchanger. The other assumed constant parameters used in the design process are as follow; pressure at turbine outlet is 19 bar, temperature at turbine outlet is 5 oC (by using minimum dew point of 0 oC based on the technical specification by BOTAŞ), temperature at turbine inlet before preheating is 20 oC, natural gas composition is 100 % methane, combined efficiency of boiler and heat exchanger is 0. 80, combined efficiency of gear box and generator is 0. 85. In addition, the process in the turbine is assumed to be adiabatic, reversible, and isentropic. The average inlet pressure at the turbine in each city-gate stations was calculated using the approach of weighted mean flow rate. Design of turbo expander system relies on conservation of mass and energy principles on a control volume. Applying the second law of thermodynamics, the minimum required natural gas temperature at the inlet of turbine can be calculated by considering the outlet temperature and pressure constraints. Heat energy necessary for increasing the temperature of natural gas before entering the turbine, so called preheating requirement, is determined from the temperature difference between the calculated gas temperature at the inlet of turbine and the average gas inlet temperature at RMS-A station. The required heat energy is provided by burning some of the natural gas from the system. Power generation from a turbo expander strongly depends on the isentropic efficiency of a turbine and the mass flow rate of natural gas. In this study, the power generation from the turbine and the required preheating energy were calculated with different isentropic efficiencies ranging from 0. 70 to 0. 85 and different design flow rates of natural gas for Çorlu, Kayseri, and Yalova RMS-A stations. Results reveal that unless provided from external sources, the preheating energy cost for increasing the natural gas temperature is approximately 50 % of the total income obtained from the generated electricity sales. In the analyses, it is assumed that natural gas cost is 0. 06746081 TL/kWh, and selling price of electricity is 0. 105 US$/kWh, and exchange rate of US $ to TL is 2. 1019. Net power generation from a turbo expander has a strong relationship with the pressure ratio at inlet and outlet, the design flow rate, and the isentropic efficiency. However, the pressure ratio is not a controllable parameter. The required preheating energy similar to total income from the turbo expander increases with increasing isentropic efficiency of turbine. Results also indicate that considering the consumption rate in year 2013, 1. 26 MW of installed capacity is sufficient for Çorlu RMS-A station with the design flow rate of 30, 000 Nm 3 /hr. Similarly, 3. 57 MW of installed capacity is sufficient for Kayseri RMS-A station with the design flow rate of 85, 000 Nm 3 /hr, and 1. 412 MW of installed capacity is sufficient for Yalova RMS-A station with the design flow rate of 35, 000 Nm 3 /hr. The design flow rates using 2013 data are adequate to operate the turbo expanders 6069 hours in Çorlu, 5009 hours in Kayseri, and 8370 hours in Yalova. Net annual revenues from the stations yield that $ 225, 071 from Çorlu RMS-A, $ 500, 898 from Kayseri RMS-A, and $ 347, 069 from Yalova RMS-A. The revenues do not consider operating costs.
