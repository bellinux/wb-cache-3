5|$|Motif finding, {{also known}} as <b>profile</b> <b>analysis,</b> is a method of {{locating}} sequence motifs in global MSAs that is both a means of producing a better MSA and a means of producing a scoring matrix for use in searching other sequences for similar motifs. A variety of methods for isolating the motifs have been developed, but {{all are based on}} identifying short highly conserved patterns within the larger alignment and constructing a matrix similar to a substitution matrix that reflects the amino acid or nucleotide composition of each position in the putative motif. The alignment can then be refined using these matrices. In standard <b>profile</b> <b>analysis,</b> the matrix includes entries for each possible character as well as entries for gaps. Alternatively, statistical pattern-finding algorithms can identify motifs as a precursor to an MSA rather than as a derivation. In many cases when the query set contains {{only a small number of}} sequences or contains only highly related sequences, pseudocounts are added to normalize the distribution reflected in the scoring matrix. In particular, this corrects zero-probability entries in the matrix to values that are small but nonzero.|$|E
25|$|The Malaysian Army {{currently}} has a soldier modernisation programme called the Future Soldier System. Under the FSS, The Malaysian Army plans to equip all soldiers with Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) such as Kevlar helmets, Kevlar vests, Oakley goggles and ear protection equipment. The programme also includes arming all the standard issue M4 carbines with SOPMOD kits, {{as well as}} equipping soldiers with a Glock series pistol. Sapura, a Malaysian electronics company, is offering their SAKTI soldier system concept via work in three areas: Head Sub-System (HSS), Body Sub-System (BSS) and Weapon Sub-System (WSS). The HSS consists of a Helmet–Mounted Micro Camera and night vision capability with a data output, helmet-mounted display and earpiece and microphone; the WSS consists of a Rifle Control Unit consisting of a five-button wireless controller for one handed use with key features including push to talk for the radio, switching the HMD on and off, turning the HMD brightness {{up and down as}} well as video transmission to friendly forces. The BSS consists of a controller system, energy unit with a power pack for the communication interface, micro-camera and HMD with a single polymer lithium ion battery for up to ten hours of operation; a communications interface for secure IP based radio which from the image is a Thales St@rmille radio and finally a navigation unit with a display for blue force tracking and situational awareness, colour digital mapping and terrain and urban <b>profile</b> <b>analysis.</b> The system displayed is visually similar to the Kord Defence SmartGrip RIC developed in partnership with Thales Australia.|$|E

30|$|In {{studying}} {{the mechanisms of}} Egr- 1 growth inhibition in epidermal cells, we observed a dramatic reduction in Cdc 25 A phosphatase levels in cells overexpressing Egr- 1. Based on the Q-PCR results, approximately 5 -fold increase of Egr- 1 leads to ∼ 4 -fold decrease in Cdc 25 A (Fig. 5). The <b>profiling</b> <b>analysis</b> demonstrated an average of 2.3 -fold increase of Egr- 1 mRNA in psoriatic tissue (Fig.  2 a). Therefore, after normalization against Egr- 1 mRNA levels from the <b>profiling</b> <b>analysis,</b> the overall difference of Cdc 25 A mRNA did not exceed two-fold (∼ 1.84 -fold). This explains why Cdc 25 A was not identified from the <b>profiling</b> <b>analysis</b> as a differentially expressed gene. Nevertheless, we did observe by immunohistochemistry that Cdc 25 A protein is less abundant in psoriatic tissue than in BCC and SCC, consistent with prior reports of Cdc 25 A overexpression in SCCs (Gasparotto et al. 1997).|$|R

30|$|Depth <b>profiling</b> <b>analysis</b> of wood samples using Fourier {{transform}} infrared photoacoustic spectroscopy (FTIR-PAS) {{was carried}} out to obtain information on the chemical changes caused by weathering. The test samples used for PAS measurements were tropical wood species, puspa (Schima wallichii Korth) and kapur (Dryobalanop lanceolata Burck), that were exposed outdoors for periods of 2 – 32 weeks. FTIR-PAS spectra of the weathered surfaces were recorded at various moving-mirror velocities {{in the range from}} 0.081 to 0.56 [*]cm/s (linear-scan method) to provide the depth <b>profiling</b> <b>analysis.</b> The band intensity of vibrations attributed to phenyl groups clearly decreased as weathering proceeded and demonstrated a tendency to be reduced with a decrease in the photoacoustic probing depth during relatively short weathering periods. The bands of C=O groups also exhibited remarkable spectral changes. The PAS spectra of the tropical wood changed considerably during the 32 weeks of weathering, and their spectral contours gradually approached that of pure cellulose (microcrystalline). It was noted that FTIR-PAS is very useful for depth <b>profiling</b> <b>analysis</b> of the wood surface {{in the early stages of}} deterioration.|$|R

Studying such a complex, multi-scale and multi-parametric problem requires educated fingerprinting of cellular physiology at different molecular levels under systematically designed perturbations. Conventional biology lacked the means for holistic analysis of biological systems. In the post-genomic era, advances in robotics and biology lead to the development of high-throughput molecular fingerprinting technologies. Transcriptional <b>profiling</b> <b>analysis</b> using DNA microarrays has been the most widely used among them. My Ph. D. thesis concerns the dynamic, transcriptional <b>profiling</b> <b>analysis</b> of a systematically perturbed plant system. Specifically, Arabidopsis thaliana liquid cultures were subjected to three different stresses, i. e. elevated CO 2 stress, salt (NaCl) stress and sugar (trehalose) applied individually, while the latter two stresses were also applied in combination with the CO 2 stress. The transcriptional profiling of these conditions involved carrying out 320 microarray hybridizations, generating thus a vast amount of transcriptomic data for Arabidopsis thalian...|$|R
