40|$|<b>Pragmatic</b> Conceptual <b>Analysis</b> is a {{proposed}} methodology for attributing correct application conditions, or 'meanings', to concepts. This methodology involves two stages: first, we seek an empirical {{understanding of the}} ways in which usage of a given concept has regularly delivered benefits, and, second, we seek an explication of that concept which is optimally capable of delivering benefits in these ways. Such an explication captures the 'pragmatic meaning' of a given concept. Chapters 1 - 3 articulate <b>Pragmatic</b> Conceptual <b>Analysis</b> and the notion of pragmatic meaning, and show how these are related to other philosophical methodologies and accounts of concept-meaning. Chapter 4 uses a 'bootstrapping argument' to establish that <b>Pragmatic</b> Conceptual <b>Analysis</b> has two important virtues. The first phase of this argument establishes that <b>Pragmatic</b> Conceptual <b>Analysis</b> has normative authority - it reveals explications that we have practical and epistemic reason to adopt, whether we take these explications to be semantically revisionary or not. This normative authority licenses using <b>Pragmatic</b> Conceptual <b>Analysis,</b> in the second phase, to explicate our shared concept of concept-meaning. This yields the conclusion that we have epistemic reason to adopt the notion of pragmatic meaning as our explication of 'concept-meaning'. Having explicated our concept in this way, we see that <b>Pragmatic</b> Conceptual <b>Analysis</b> also has descriptive authority - it is a semantically conservative tool that reveals concept-meaning, thus explicated. The initial presentation of the bootstrapping argument considers only one sort of work that our concept of concept-meaning does - helping to guide our application of other concepts. But this concept also regularly delivers benefits in a second way - by helping us to give good explanations for the behavior and behavioral success of various concept-users. Chapter 5 uses the normative authority of <b>Pragmatic</b> Conceptual <b>Analysis</b> to justify a particular account of how good explanations work. Chapter 6 draws upon this account to argue that, in order best to explain people's behavioral successes, we need an explication of concept-meaning that is closely related to the one presented in Chapter 4. Chapter 7 considers several objections and hard cases, and argues that <b>Pragmatic</b> Conceptual <b>Analysis</b> weathers these storms in good shape...|$|R

50|$|The {{coordination}} {{and integration of}} social action has been explained {{in many ways by}} many theories. Rational choice theory and game theory are two examples, which describe the integration of individuals into social groups by detailing the complex manner in which individuals motivated only by self-interest will form mutually beneficial and cooperative social arrangements. In contrast to these, Habermas has formulated a theory of communicative action. (Habermas 1984; 1987) This theory and the project of developing a formal <b>pragmatic</b> <b>analysis</b> of communication are inseparable.|$|E
50|$|These last points {{concerning}} {{the breadth of}} communicative rationality have {{by far the most}} important implications. By differentiating the three validity dimensions and holding them as equally valuable and rational, a broader and multifaceted conception of rationality is opened. What this means is that Habermas has, through the formal <b>pragmatic</b> <b>analysis</b> of communication, revealed that rationality should not be limited to the consideration and resolution of objective concerns. He claims that the structure of communication itself demonstrates that normative and evaluative concerns can (and ought to) be resolved through rational procedures.|$|E

40|$|Being an {{inherent}} {{part of the}} theory of semiotics, pragmatics focuses within a narrow range, on the rapport between signs and the one who makes use of them during the processes of communication and meaning. This paper attempts to highlight the efficiency and supremacy of the pragmatics' view over the ironic discourse in Sorescu's theatrical writing, due to his specific working methods. Irony, perceived by specialists as conversational implicature (Grice), or as indirect speech act (Searle), or as a strategy of politeness (Brown and Levinson), develops into an incredibly appealing subject of study, due to its numerous production mechanisms within the dramatic literary discourse, thus initiating special interpretational frameworks of the language, which is regarded as being in action. The choice for Sorescu's theatrical work and the study of its related ironic discourse lie in the belief that the dramatic discourse is the closest to the verbal exchanges in a society, thus thoroughly justifying a <b>pragmatics</b> <b>analysis...</b>|$|R
50|$|Semiotics {{in popular}} music, or mesomusica, is {{different}} from semiotics in other musical forms, because pop music denotes a cultural object. (Matusitz, 2004). Popular music has many signs in itself because it has many components and uses, but it also appeals to the emotions of a generation. Music is the “logical expression” of feelings, a “symbolic form”. Music videos are an example of syntagm, which interacting signifiers form a meaningful whole. Music videos are also considered multimodal genres because one semiotic system is joined syntagmatically to another semiotic system, which results in a signified indexical meaning. The process of music correlated with visuals {{can be described in}} terms of two basic mechanisms: temporal synchronicity and cross-modal homology. Incorporating the two modalities, sound and image, we can interpret it as a unified syntagm. Music videos are known to be visually secondary signified in combination with the semantic content of the lyrics. Semiotics in music videos {{is different from}} a <b>pragmatic</b> <b>analysis</b> because we can uphold that semiotics searches for meaning by considering sign production and progress, while pragmatics searches for meaning by considering the intentions of semantics and the context it has evolved in.|$|E
5000|$|As a {{consequence}} of the adaptation of Zen to the modern world, and the cross-cultural fertilization of western transcendentalism and esotery and Japanese Zen,a romantic idea of enlightenment as insight into a timeless, transcendent reality has been popularized. This is especially due to the influence of Soyen Shaku and his student D.T. Suzuki, who, though known as a Zen Buddhist, was also influenced by Theosophy. Further popularization was due to the writings of Heinrich Dumoulin. Dumoulin viewed metaphysics as the expression of a transcendent truth, which according to him was expressed by Mahayana Buddhism, but not by the <b>pragmatic</b> <b>analysis</b> of the oldest Buddhism, which emphasizes anatta. This romantic vision fits into Western romantic notions of self-realization and the true self, being regarded as a substantial essence being covered over by social conditioning: Westerners do have a preconception of what ought to happen in mystical insight and in the attainment of enlightenment. True mystical insight, they will object, is not something that can be imposed from outside by a social system; instead it is a welling up of psychic energy from within, a breakthrough in which the true self erupts through the shell imposed by intellect, self-images, and socialization.|$|E
50|$|This {{concept was}} first {{postulated}} by Funk and Reinstrom (1966) as a reflexion {{about the most}} efficient way to produce fuels (e.g. hydrogen, ammonia) from stable and abundant species (e.g. water, nitrogen) and heat sources. Although fuel availability was scarcely considered before the oil crisis era, these researches were justified by niche markets. As an example, in the military logistics field, providing fuels for vehicles in remote battlefields is a key task. Hence, a mobile production system based on a portable heat source (a specific nuclear reactor was strikingly considered) was being investigated with the uttermost interest.Following the crisis, many programs (Europe,Japan,USA) were set up to design, test and qualify such processes for more peaceful purposes such as energy independence. High temperature (1000K) nuclear reactors were still considered as the heat sources. However, the optimistic expectations of the first thermodynamics studies were quickly moderated by more <b>pragmatic</b> <b>analysis</b> based on fair comparisons with standard technologies (thermodynamic cycles for electricity generation, coupled with the electrolysis of water) and by numerous practical issues (not high enough temperatures with nuclear reactors, slow reactivities, reactor corrosion, significant losses of intermediate compounds with time...). Hence, the interest for this technology was fading away during the next decades, or at least some tradeoffs (hybrid versions) were being considered with the use of electricity as a fractional energy input instead of only heat for the reactions (e.g. Hybrid sulfur cycle). A rebirth in the year 2000 can be explained by both new energy crisis and the rapid pace of development of concentrated solar power technologies whose potentially very high temperatures are ideal for thermochemical processes, while the environmentally friendly side of these researches attracts funding in a period with the peak oil shadow.|$|E

For example, Stefan Halper and Jonathan Clarke (a libertarian based at Cato), in their 2004 book on neoconservatism, America Alone: The Neo-Conservatives and the Global Order, characterized the neoconservatives, at that time, as uniting: … around three common themes: # A belief deriving from religious {{conviction that the}} human condition {{is defined as a}} choice between good and evil and that the true measure of political character {{is to be found in}} the willingness by the former (themselves) to confront the latter. # An assertion that the fundamental determinant of the relationship between states rests on military power and the willingness to use it. # A primary focus on the Middle East and global Islam as the principal theater for American overseas interests. In putting these themes into practice, neo-conservatives: # Analyze international issues in black-and-white, absolute moral categories. They are fortified by a conviction that they alone hold the moral high ground and argue that disagreement is tantamount to defeatism. # Focus on the [...] "unipolar" [...] power of the United States, seeing the use of military force as the first, not the last, option of foreign policy. They repudiate the [...] "lessons of Vietnam," [...] which they interpret as undermining American will toward the use of force, and embrace the [...] "lessons of Munich," [...] interpreted as establishing the virtues of preemptive military action. # Disdain conventional diplomatic agencies such as the State Department and conventional country-specific, realist, and <b>pragmatic,</b> <b>analysis.</b> They are hostile toward nonmilitary multilateral institutions and instinctively antagonistic toward international treaties and agreements.
