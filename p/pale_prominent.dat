5|$|Young {{southern}} boobooks {{are usually}} paler than adults, {{and do not}} attain adult plumage properly until their third or fourth year. Juveniles (up to a year old) have whitish underparts and foreneck, a larger and more <b>prominent</b> <b>pale</b> eyebrow and larger whitish spots on their upperparts. The tips of their feathers are white and fluffy, remnants of the nestlings' down. These are worn away over time, persisting longest on the head. The feathers of the head, neck and underparts are fluffier overall. Immatures in their second and third year have plumage more like adults, though their crowns are paler and more heavily streaked.|$|R
25|$|Biannual and {{perennial}} plants produce a stout taproot {{of up to}} 8cm in diameter and 60cm long. Young plants consist of a rosette of leaves, which may be variegated, once-pinnately spiny-lobed, to 30cm long, and having short, fleshy stalks. The stems can be simple or carry many branches, and carry spiny wings along their lengths. The wavy leaves with prominent veins are pinnately divided and are alternately set along the stems. The leaf margin has <b>prominent</b> <b>pale</b> green or yellow veins and large teeth which are topped by fierce spines. The leaf surface may initially be covered in soft, felty hairs, which quickly clear away, most slowly on the veins.|$|R
50|$|Its usual {{habitat is}} near rivers, streams and pools. The adult is a {{medium-sized}} damselfly with {{a length of}} 35 to 40mm, and wingspan similar to its length. The thorax is black with two pale green stripes. The abdomen is dark with five <b>prominent</b> <b>pale</b> or green bands, the largest being on segments 5 and 8. The wings of the male have a yellowish tint, which may also {{be seen on the}} female. In Australia, the distribution is in suitable habitat in the north-eastern part of the continent from the tip of Cape York Peninsula to the southern Queensland border. The taxon has not been assessed in the IUCN Red List.|$|R
500|$|The {{smallest}} owl on the Australian mainland, {{the southern}} boobook is [...] long, with predominantly dark brown plumage with <b>prominent</b> <b>pale</b> spots. It has grey-green or yellow-green eyes. It is generally nocturnal, though is sometimes active {{at dawn and}} dusk, retiring to roost in secluded spots in the foliage of trees. The southern boobook feeds on insects and small vertebrates, hunting by pouncing on them from tree perches. Breeding takes place from late winter to early summer, with tree hollows used as nesting sites. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the southern boobook as being of least concern on account of its large range and apparently stable population.|$|R

50|$|Mainland birds measure 11.5 cm {{in length}} and olive brown upperparts (greyish brown in the spotted {{subspecies}} and dark brown in Tasmania), with <b>prominent</b> <b>pale</b> irises and a white brow. The throat is white with faint streaks in the subspecies frontalis and laevigaster and heavily spotted in maculatus. Ear coverts are grey in frontalis and black in laevigaster, and brownish {{in the other two}} subspecies. The underparts are pale, though buff in laevigaster. The thin bill is black. The Females are duller overall and generally have pale gray lores, whereas males have blackish lores. This allows most individuals to be reliably sexed in the field. The call is a loud high-pitched ts-cheer.|$|R
50|$|The {{flowers are}} borne singly in leaf axils on stalks 5-13 mm long. There are 5 pale pink to bright red, {{slightly}} overlapping, lanceolate sepals which are 7-11 mm long. The petals are 12-18 mm long and joined at their lower end {{to form a}} tube. The petal tube is white, sometimes pale pink or <b>pale</b> blue with <b>prominent</b> brownish spots inside. The petal tube is mostly glabrous except {{that there are many}} club-shaped hairs inside, near the base of the tube. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed within the tube. Flowering occurs mostly from June to August and is followed by fruits which are dry, woody, oval-shaped with a papery covering and 5.5-6.5 mm long.|$|R
50|$|Pallas's leaf warbler {{is one of}} the {{smallest}} warblers, with a large head and short tail. At 9 - 10 cm long and 4 - 7 g in weight, it is slightly smaller than a yellow-browed warbler and barely any larger than a goldcrest. It has greenish upperparts and white underparts, but is very striking, with <b>prominent</b> <b>pale</b> yellow double wingbars on the wing covert feathers, bold yellow supercilia and central crown stripe, and a lemon-yellow rump. The bill is blackish-brown with a yellowish tinge to the cutting edges and the base of the lower mandible, the iris is brown, and the legs are brown with a green or greyish tinge. Although the yellow rump is obvious when a bird is low in vegetation or hovering, it can otherwise be hard to see.|$|R
40|$|Posttransplant {{lymphoproliferative}} disorders (PTLDs) comprise {{a spectrum of}} complications that affect immunocompromised patients following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or solid organ transplantation. Its incidence varies depending on the transplanted organ, occurring in approximately 2. 3 % of kidney transplantations. A 31 -year-old woman was referred to the Dental Clinic of the State University of Western ParanÃ¡ for evaluation of an oral lesion. Her medical history revealed a previous diagnosis of hypertension, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) seropositivity, and kidney transplantation 12 Â years prior. She was under standard immunosuppressive therapy. Intraoral examination identified a gingival necrotic lesion with extension to the posterior right lower alveolar bone. An incisional biopsy was performed. Histologic examination showed lymphocytic proliferation of cells with small and hyperchromatic nuclei, atypical mitosis, and cells with large and <b>pale</b> nuclei showing <b>prominent</b> nucleoli permeating connective tissue, muscle fibers, and adipocytes. Correlation of clinical, histologic, and immunohistochemical findings led to a diagnosis of polymorphic EBV-associated PTLD rich in B and T cells...|$|R
40|$|General Description: Perennial with {{clustered}} stems on short, stout, often ascending {{or nearly}} vertical rhizomes; culms 16 - 40 inches tall or sometimes more, {{more or less}} flattened at least distally and commonly 1 / 16 inch wide, some of them commonly proliferous (rooting from an apical bulbil); spikelets to inch long, 10 - 20 flowered; scales equaling or surpassing the achene; stigmas 3; achene light greenish to medium brown, rounded trigonous to planoconvex, smooth and shining or slightly cellularroughened, 1 / 16 to c inch long, including the <b>prominent,</b> <b>pale</b> tubercle which is up to 1 / 16 inch long and is confluent with {{the body of the}} achene. Identification Tips: The characters that distinguish Eleocharis rostellata from co-occurring species of Eleocharis are the presence of 3 stigmas and a tubercle that is confluent with the achene. In addition, the species produces long, proliferous stems. Phenology: Details of the phenology of Eleocharis rostellata have not been reported. The species apparently flowers from June through August, probably depending somewhat on the microclimate of the site...|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is about 46 mm. It is similar to Gnathothlibus meeki but differs in the longer, strongly falcate forewings, the red coloration {{on the underside of}} the thorax and the hindwing discal spot. The head has a red stripe anterior to the eye and a creamy yellow spot at the base of the antenna. The upperside of the thorax is dark brown with two <b>prominent</b> <b>pale</b> yellow spots. The outer margins of the tegulae are creamy yellow. The underside of the thorax is red laterally, pale yellow in the centre and dark brown near the legs. The forewing upperside pattern is reminiscent of Ampelophaga khasiana but with a strong greenish tint. The ground colour is dark green-brown with an obscure pattern of transverse lines and bands. The forewing underside is bright yellow with a brown outer margin and dark yellow irroration on the outer third of the wing. The hindwing upperside is bright yellow with a black spot at the base. The marginal band is dark brown.|$|R
60|$|Philip {{followed}} {{him across the}} passage and was shown into a room, small and barely furnished, in which a little, thin man was standing {{with his back to}} the fireplace. He was much below the middle height, but his large head, which seemed to hang loosely on his body, gave him an odd ungainliness. His features were wide and flattened, and he had <b>prominent,</b> <b>pale</b> eyes; his thin hair was sandy; he wore whiskers that grew unevenly on his face, and in places where you would have expected the hair to grow thickly there was no hair at all. His skin was pasty and yellow. He held out his hand to Philip, and when he smiled showed badly decayed teeth. He spoke with a patronising and at the same time a timid air, as though he sought to assume an importance which he did not feel. He said he hoped Philip would like the work; there was a good deal of drudgery about it, but when you got used to it, it was interesting; and one made money, that was the chief thing, wasn't it? He laughed with his odd mixture of superiority and shyness.|$|R
