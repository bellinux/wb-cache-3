25|$|Windows Vista {{features}} Windows Color System (WCS), {{a platform}} for color management. Its goal is to obtain color consistency across various software and hardware, including cameras, monitors, <b>printers</b> <b>and</b> <b>scanners.</b> Different devices interpret the same colors differently, according to their software and hardware configurations. As a result, they must be properly calibrated to reproduce colors consistently across different devices. WCS aims to make this process of color calibration automatic and transparent, as an evolution of ICC Color Profiles.|$|E
25|$|Currently most {{operating}} systems support {{a variety of}} networking protocols, hardware, and applications for using them. This means that computers running dissimilar {{operating systems}} can participate in a common network for sharing resources such as computing, files, <b>printers,</b> <b>and</b> <b>scanners</b> using either wired or wireless connections. Networks can essentially allow a computer's operating system to access the resources of a remote computer to support the same functions as it could if those resources were connected directly to the local computer. This includes everything from simple communication, to using networked file systems or even sharing another computer's graphics or sound hardware. Some network services allow the resources of a computer to be accessed transparently, such as SSH which allows networked users direct access to a computer's command line interface.|$|E

Depending on the target use, the grid size (total number of symbols), symbol density (the printed size of the triangles), and symbol count (number of colors used) can be varied. HCCB can use an eight-, four-, or two-color (black-and-white) palette. Microsoft claims that {{laboratory}} tests using standard off-the-shelf <b>printers</b> <b>and</b> <b>scanners</b> have yielded readable eight-color HCCBs equivalent to approximately 3,500 characters per square inch.|$|E

Parallel-to-USB cable, or use a PCI parallel printer port card. Generally, FireWire's very high speeds of up to 800 Mbit/s are excessive for printers.|$|E
5000|$|The theory is: If Rainbow's [...] "geometric" [...] {{algorithm}} {{is to be}} encoded and decoded by a computer, it would equally viable to store the compressed data on a conventional disk rather than printing it to paper or other non-digital medium. Printing something as dots on a page rather than bits on a disk will not change the underlying compression ratio, so a lossless compression algorithm that could store 250 gigabytes within a few hundred megabytes of data would be revolutionary indeed. Likewise, data can be compressed with any algorithm and subsequently printed to paper as colored dots. The amount of data that can be reliably stored {{in this way is}} limited by the <b>printer</b> <b>and</b> <b>scanner,</b> as described above.|$|R

50|$|Modern fake ID cards almost {{invariably}} carry {{a picture of}} the authorized user, a simple and effective form of biometric identification. However, forgery of simple photographic ID cards has become simple in recent years with the availability of low-cost high-resolution <b>printers</b> <b>and</b> <b>scanners</b> and photo editing software. Simple fake ID cards are commonly made using an inkjet or laser printer to print a replica document which is then laminated to resemble a real ID card. Most designs are made using computer programs, re-creating scanned copies of a license.|$|E

Witricity can make an amazing change by removing the use of conventional copper cables and current carrying wires in the field of the electrical & electronics engineering. By using this concept, we can transfer the power to minimum range. This technique can be used for charging batteries those are actually not possible to connect electrically like pace makers which is fixed in the body that runs on a battery. And also this technique can be used in numeral applications, for charging consumer electronics devices such as cell phone, iPod, laptop battery, propeller clock, <b>printer,</b> <b>and</b> <b>scanner</b> wirelessly.
