Indeed, it was hard to blame the <b>prison</b> <b>officer</b> who observed that he thought it was the Minister for Defence paying an informal visit to Mountjoy Prison yesterday because, of course, we all know the Minister for Defence is wont to use helicopters, as somebody observed already, as other Ministers are wont to use State cars.|$|E

5|$|On 4 March 2016, a <b>prison</b> <b>officer</b> (Adrian Ismay) had a {{heart attack}} and died in a hospital. He had {{received}} serious wounds following a booby-trap bomb detonating under his van on Hillsborough Drive, East Belfast 11 days earlier. The wounds he received from the bombing were directly responsible for the heart attack that killed him. The 'New' IRA claimed responsibility and said it was a response to the alleged mistreatment of republican prisoners at Maghaberry Prison. It added that the officer was targeted because he trained prison officers at Maghaberry.|$|E
5|$|Fremantle Prison {{comprises}} substantially intact convict era structures, {{including the}} limestone perimeter walls of exceptional heritage significance.

His performance was described as characteristically powerful in The Independent. He also played tabloid journalist Dave Dewston in the four-part BBC serial Murder, and <b>prison</b> <b>officer</b> Mike in the part-improvised single drama Out of Control. He researched the latter part by shadowing prison officers in a young offenders' institution for a week. At the beginning of 2003, he {{played the role of}} Richie MacGregor in This Little Life, a television drama about a mother who has to cope with her 16-week-premature baby. Morrissey researched premature births by speaking to paediatricians at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the IRA's {{assassination}} campaign against <b>prison</b> <b>officers,</b> relations between the prisoners and <b>prison</b> <b>officers</b> were tense.

5|$|The Maze Prison escape (known to Irish {{republicans}} as the Great Escape) {{took place on}} 25 September 1983 in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. HM Prison Maze (also known as Long Kesh) was a maximum security prison considered {{to be one of}} the most escape-proof prisons in Europe, and held prisoners convicted of taking part in armed paramilitary campaigns during the Troubles. In the biggest prison escape in UK history, 38 Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) prisoners escaped from H-Block 7 (H7) of the prison. One <b>prison</b> <b>officer</b> died of a heart attack as a result of the escape and twenty others were injured, including two who were shot with guns that had been smuggled into the prison. The escape was a propaganda coup for the IRA, and a British government minister faced calls to resign. The official inquiry into the escape placed most of the blame onto prison staff, who in turn blamed the escape on political interference in the running of the prison.|$|E
5|$|The prison {{officers}} {{guarding the}} gates outside the chapel abandoned them, and ran towards the Centre. The <b>prison</b> <b>officer</b> {{in charge of}} the Centre saw his colleagues running {{from the direction of the}} chapel, but due to the presence of scaffolding he was in a poor position to view the upper levels, and mistakenly assumed he saw prisoners running from the chapel. He informed other officers on C1 and D1 of this and, upon hearing that prisoners were in possession of keys, told them and officers on A1 that they should evacuate the prison. Governor Morrison, who was responsible for the main prison, was present and did not intervene with these instructions. Morrison then ordered officers to evacuate the Centre at 11:13 am as he mistakenly believed prisoners had entered the Centre. By this time prisoners had gained access to the roofs of E and F wings, and from there gained access to other wings by making holes in unprotected office ceilings.|$|E
5|$|The prisoners found A and B wings {{unsupervised}} as {{the prison}} officers had already evacuated, {{and began to}} free other prisoners who were still locked in their cells. The <b>prison</b> <b>officer</b> {{in charge of the}} first landing of C wing was ordered to evacuate, {{and with the help of}} three other officers evacuated the 73 Rule 43(a) prisoners being held there, being fearful for the safety of the prisoners who were regarded as sex offenders. Due to rioting prisoners entering the wing, the officers were unable to evacuate a further seven Rule 43(a) prisoners who were being held on the second landing. Rioting prisoners also gained access to E wing, where the Rule 43(a) prisoners had been left locked in their cells after the prison officers evacuated. A number of these Rule 43(a) prisoners were attacked by rioting prisoners. One such prisoner was Derek White, who was being held on remand on charges of indecent assault and buggery. White later died in North Manchester General Hospital on 3 April after being admitted suffering from head wounds, a dislocated shoulder and chest pains.|$|E

5|$|Finucane {{continued}} to the pedestrian gate where he stabbed the officer controlling the gate, and two officers {{who had just}} entered the prison. This incident was seen by a soldier on duty in a watch tower, who reported to the British Army operations room {{that he had seen}} prison officers fighting. The operations room telephoned the prison's Emergency Control Room (ECR), which replied that everything was all right and that an alarm had been accidentally triggered earlier. At 4:12 pm the alarm was raised when an officer in the gatehouse pushed the prisoner holding him hostage {{out of the room and}} telephoned the ECR. However, this was not done soon enough to prevent the escape. After several attempts the prisoners had opened the main gate, and were waiting for the prisoners still in the gatehouse to rejoin them in the lorry. At this time two prison officers blocked the exit with their cars, forcing the prisoners to abandon the lorry and make their way to the outer fence which was 25 yards away. Four prisoners attacked one of the officers and hijacked his car, which they drove towards the external gate. They crashed into a car near the gate and abandoned the car. Two escaped through the gate, one was captured exiting the car, and another was captured after being chased by a soldier. At the main gate, a <b>prison</b> <b>officer</b> was shot in the leg while chasing the only two prisoners who had not yet reached the outer fence. The prisoner who fired the shot was captured after being shot and wounded by a soldier in a watch tower, and the other prisoner was captured after falling. The other prisoners escaped over the fence, and by 4:18 pm the main gate was closed and the prison secured, after 35 prisoners had breached the prison perimeter. The escape was the biggest in both British and Irish history, and the biggest in Europe since World War II.|$|E

25|$|Following his conviction, Baker {{remained}} in the public spotlight after several further violent incidents inside Auckland Prison. In July 2008, while being returned to Auckland Prison from Auckland City Hospital after treatment for self-inflicted injuries, Baker pulled a concealed shiv on a <b>prison</b> <b>officer</b> {{in an attempt to}} escape. The <b>prison</b> <b>officer</b> received minor injuries and Baker was returned to Auckland Prison. On 27 August 2009, Baker took hostage a fellow inmate in Auckland Prison using a makeshift knife and two razor blades. Police managed to defuse the situation and nobody was harmed in the incident. In 2010, Baker was found guilty on charges that resulted from these two incidents and was subsequently sentenced to preventive detention with no possibility of parole for at least 16 years.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore how <b>prison</b> <b>officers</b> in Sweden manage their {{feelings}} in remand prisons versus inmates and colleagues. Due to changes in the <b>prison</b> <b>officers</b> occupational role and work environment we found it profoundly interesting to study how <b>prison</b> <b>officers</b> perceive and reflect on their emotion management, that relates to the work they perform. The <b>prison</b> <b>officers</b> occupational role includes tasks that corresponds with security work and rehabilitative labor towards inmates, this tend to create a complexity as the occupational role consists of contradictive tasks. They need to uphold safety by physical means simultaneously as they need to become more intimate with inmates to accomplish the rehabilitative tasks. The study proceeds with a qualitative inquiry with six interviews from three different remand prisons around Sweden. The interviews are divided into two informants from each remand prison. The results proclaims that <b>prison</b> <b>officers</b> need to manage emotions that are generated from the institutional environment, as well as from their colleagues and the inmates. The emotional work is marked as a multifaceted emotional work that changes due to different circumstances and work tasks. Â  The results doesnâ€™t give a general approach to the matter, but it contributes to knowledge and a deeper understanding of the <b>prison</b> <b>officers</b> occupational sphere. ...|$|R

50|$|Questions {{were raised}} about the POA's status in the 1990s. In 1994, a legal {{decision}} determined that it was illegal to induce <b>prison</b> <b>officers</b> to take industrial action - a law which had applied to police officers since 1919 - meaning that the POA could not call strike action amongst its members. New labour legislation introduced by the Conservative government in 1992 laid down that the POA {{could no longer be}} a trade union. This was reversed in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act of 1994, but <b>prison</b> <b>officers</b> were still denied the right to take industrial action. This right was restored in 2004 to <b>prison</b> <b>officers</b> in the public sector in England, Wales and Scotland, but not in Northern Ireland or to <b>prison</b> <b>officers</b> in the private sector.|$|R
