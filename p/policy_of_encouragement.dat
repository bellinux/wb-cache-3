We must sweep away all opposition, for opposition to the right is wrong; we must agree that slavery is right, and we must adopt the idea that property has persuaded the owner to believe that slavery is morally right and socially elevating.

40|$|This {{research}} is entitled “The Concept of Developed Country in Drama Script “Nyanyian Rimbayana” (A Study of Roland Barthes’ Semiotics with Myth of Liberal Capitalism) ”. The {{analysis of this}} {{research is}} basically concerning the issues of idea of developed country perceived from the liberal capitalism system which is depicted through the sign systems found in the drama script. Principally, the research is a descriptive qualitative research with Roland Barthes’s semiotics as the main tool to examine the data. The first phase piloted is detecting several sign systems and their forms through plot, character, and setting and identifying their meanings (first order signification of language level). The sign systems are then interpreted by relating them to some primary theories of model of liberal capitalism to present their significances/intricate meanings (second order signification of myth level). The results show that the sign systems found are in form of explicit or implicit mode (way of conveying), verbal interaction or action/nonverbal interaction (technique of interaction), and primary or secondary text (type of text). Whilst, the concept of developed country illustrated through the sign systems predominantly can be detached into four criteria, those are infrastructure appearance, social class, leader role, industrial prototype. Observed based on the myth of liberal capitalism, the settings of concept of developed country illustrated by the four criteria specifically are such as modernity of infrastructure (infrastructure appearance); diversity of social class, capital force (social class); mercantilism, non-intervention <b>of</b> government, <b>policies</b> <b>of</b> <b>encouragement,</b> the disregard <b>of</b> domestic <b>policies,</b> and non-inward-looking development policies (leader role); and market force, free market system, openness of country’s economies, the domination of the third industrial sector, profit motive, private ownership property, and no legal limit on the accumulation of property (industrial prototype).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} thrombolytic and acetylsalicylic acid therapies in acute myocardial infarct patients {{as well as the}} availability of technical and human resources for the care of these patients in the emergency units of the city of Rio de Janeiro. Additional objectives were the evaluation of the use of primary angioplasty and the level of acceptance of SBC /RJ as an entity responsible for programs of continued medical education. METHODS: Interviews with physicians at 46 emergency units in the city of Rio de Janeiro. RESULTS: Of the 46 emergency units inspected, a <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> <b>encouragement</b> to use thrombolytic therapy was only prescribed in 6. 5 %. In 1 / 3 of the public wards no thrombolytic agents were available, and in none of them was access to primary angioplasty regularly available; 45. 9 % did not offer the minimal conditions required for the handling of cases of acute myocardial infarction; 60 % of the physicians on-call (at both public and private emergency units), appeared not to know the importance of the use of acetylsalicylic acid in acute myocardial infarct patients; all physicians interviewed would participate in programs of continued medical education organized by the SBC/RJ. CONCLUSION: The study suggests there was: 1) the low probability of the use of thrombolytic therapy in the majority of the emergency units in of the city of Rio de Janeiro due to the inadequate policy of waiting for the transfer of the patient to coronary or intensive care unit; 2) a low awareness to the importance of early use of acetylsalic acid in acute myocardial infarct; 3) half of the emergency units of the public net do not have the minimal conditions required for the handling of cases of acute myocardial infarction; 4) a high level of credibility exists that would enable the SBC/RJ to set up programs for continued medical education to change the mentality regarding the use of thrombolytic therapy and of acetylsalicylic acid...|$|E

40|$|In the 1970 s, being highly {{dependent}} on the importation of fossil fuels (e. g. for nearly 80 % of its purchased energy-supplies in 1973), France suffered more intensely than the majority of other countries from the two crude-oil unit-price crises of 1973 [...] > 1974 and 1979 [...] > 1980.

These have simultaneously both reduced France's energy vulnerability and helped protect the environment. During the last 25 years, France's annual energy consumption has grown while the amount of fuel imported per year has declined, {{mainly because of the}} vast nuclear-power investment.

40|$|Globalization has {{not only}} {{accelerated}} international migration, but {{has also been a}} dynamic force for change in national political economies. Rapid economic growth in East Asia has led to great demand for immigrant labor for example, yet many states in East Asia have adopted strict controls on international labor migration. Due to international needs and domestic conditions however, these states cannot avoid an influx of migration. Taiwan is one of Asia’s four` little dragons, but it faces developmental limitations due to its small land mass. In recent years, faced with a rapidly changing social structure and the urgent need for economic transformation, many more migrants are arriving from Southeast Asia and Mainland China. What are the main factors behind this? This article will focus on the functional imperatives of the Taiwanese state in respect to migration, and will explore the crucial pull factors involved in migration to Taiwan, from demographics, economic needs and national efficiency, to civil society. Furthermore, it will develop a dynamic model that can help explain and predict the shape <b>of</b> immigration <b>policy</b> in terms <b>of</b> <b>encouragement,</b> restriction, or the prevention of new settlers...|$|R

The author demonstrates how Taiwan's unique combination of strong organic nationalism, meager natural resources and limited access to foreign capital helped curb the Extended Dutch Disease phenomenon endemic in LDCs. In addition, the government's non-oscillatory, relatively laissez-faire fiscal and monetary <b>policies,</b> <b>encouragement</b> <b>of</b> technological innovation, plus generous educational, R&D and infrastructural expenditures have contributed to low rates of inflation and high rates of GDP growth.

40|$|This paper tests a {{new method}} for {{encouraging}} Web survey respondents {{to complete a}} questionnaire once they have started it and, thus, {{reduce the number of}} breakoffs. This paper builds upon prior studies that have examined the effects of using feedback mechanisms in Web surveys to encourage questionnaire completion and breakoff reduction (Crawford, Couper, & Lamias, 2001; Couper, Traugott, & Lamias, 2001; Conrad, Couper, Tourangeau, & Peytchev, 2005; Heerwegh & Loosveldt, 2006; Matzat, Snijders, & van der Horst, 2009). The proposed method displays textual messages <b>of</b> <b>encouragement</b> intermittingly to Web survey respondents. We hypothesized that such messages would reduce the number of breakoffs or, at minimum, delay eventual breakoffs. We tested this hypothesis by mounting a Web survey experiment on a national sample of college students (National Survey of Living Learning Programs, 52 institutions, N = 110, 427 students). The sample was divided into 3 mutually exclusive groups that received: (1) no messages <b>of</b> <b>encouragement</b> (control), (2) brief messages <b>of</b> <b>encouragement</b> with generic content, and (3) brief messages <b>of</b> <b>encouragement</b> that contained content tailored to their specific school. The results suggest no association between displaying messages <b>of</b> <b>encouragement</b> and deterring or delaying breakoffs. Further, no association was found between messages <b>of</b> <b>encouragement</b> and the amount of time respondents spent logged in to the survey instrument or the number of items presented to them. The failure to find evidence is analyzed and detailed recommendations for further research on the relationship between feedback mechanisms and survey completion are given...|$|R

30|$|<b>Encouragement</b> <b>of</b> participation, {{which refers}} {{to the degree that}} the {{organization}} encourages employees to make decisions on their own work and participate in decisions regarding the organization (Bamberger, Biron, & Meshoulam, 2014; Bamberger & Meshoulam, 2000; Sun et al., 2007), is a typical organizational condition that promotes leader-subordinate exchange. Thus, we conceptualize <b>encouragement</b> <b>of</b> participation as creating an advantageous environment for social capital accumulation. Organizations with a high level <b>of</b> <b>encouragement</b> <b>of</b> participation provide employees with opportunities to have smooth communication with leaders and give suggestions to improve their performance (Bamberger et al., 2014; Bamberger & Meshoulam, 2000; Sun et al., 2007). From a social capital perspective (Lin, 1999, 2002), networking processes require employees to connect to influential people and be in a position where it is easy to generate and receive opportunities (Pfeffer, 1992). A high level <b>of</b> <b>encouragement</b> <b>of</b> participation would provide a favorable environment for employees to exert influence and receive opportunities. Thus, employees with a high level <b>of</b> <b>encouragement</b> <b>of</b> participation are more likely to utilize their ability to network to achieve career success (e.g., high income) than in a low-participation environment. Therefore, we propose that <b>encouragement</b> <b>of</b> participation will moderate the relationship between employee networking ability and later income. Specifically, when <b>encouragement</b> <b>of</b> participation is high, an increase in networking ability will be associated with increased income. When <b>encouragement</b> <b>of</b> participation is low, the positive relationship between networking ability and income will be attenuated.|$|R

Current theories in economies and business administration are not very useful for understanding this phenomenon. Neo-classical economies' assumption of perfect competition, as well as dissertations on product obsolescence and transaction costs, permeate theories in business administration and do not help us comprehend this new organizational phenomenon.
