40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the possibility of}} producing helium enhanced stars in globular clusters by accreting <b>polluted</b> <b>matter</b> during the pre-main sequence phase. We followed the evolution of two different classes of pre-main sequence accreting models, one which neglects and the other {{that takes into account}} the protostellar evolution. We analysed the dependence of the final central helium abundance, of the tracks position in the HR diagram and of the surface lithium abundance evolution on the age at which the accretion of polluted material begins and on the main physical parameters that govern the protostellar evolution. The later {{is the beginning of the}} late accretion and the lower are both the central helium and the surface lithium abundances at the end of the accretion phase and in ZAMS (Zero Age Main Sequence). In order to produce a relevant increase of the central helium content the accretion of <b>polluted</b> <b>matter</b> should start at ages lower than 1 Myr. The inclusion of the protostellar evolution has a strong impact on the ZAMS models too. The adoption of a very low seed mass (i. e. 0. 001 M_) results in models with the lowest central helium and surface lithium abundances. The higher is the accretion rate and the lower is the final helium content in the core and the residual surface lithium. In the worst case [...] i. e. seed mass 0. 001 M_ and accretion rate > 10 ^- 5 M_ yr^- 1 [...] the central helium is not increased at all and the surface lithium is fully depleted in the first few million years.

40|$|Our view of Globular Clusters has deeply {{changed in}} the last decade. Modern spectroscopic and {{photometric}} data have conclusively established that globulars are neither coeval nor monometallic, reopening the issue of the formation of such systems. Their formation is now schematized as a two-step process, during which the <b>polluted</b> <b>matter</b> from the more massive stars of a first generation gives birth, in the cluster innermost regions, to a second generation of stars with the characteristic signature of fully CNO-processed matter. To date, star-to-star variations in abundances of the light elements (C, N, O, Na) have been observed in stars of all evolutionary phases in all properly studied Galactic globular clusters. Multiple or broad evolutionary sequences have also been observed in nearly all the clusters that have been observed with good signal-to-noise in the appropriate photometric bands. The body of evidence suggests that spreads in light-element abundances can be fairly well traced by photometric indices including near ultraviolet passbands, as CNO abundance variations affect mainly wavelengths shorter than 400 nm owing to the rise of some NH and CN molecular absorption bands. Here, we exploit this property of near ultraviolet photometry to trace internal chemical variations and combined it with low resolution spectroscopy aimed to derive carbon and nitrogen abundances in order to maximize the information on the multiple populations. This approach has been proven to be very effective in (i) detecting multiple population, (ii) characterizing their global properties (i. e., relative fraction of stars, location in the color-magnitude diagram, spatial distribution, and trends with cluster parameters) and (iii) precisely tagging their chemical properties (i. e., extension of the C-N anticorrelation, bimodalities in the N content) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{empirical}} {{focus of}} this thesis {{is the issue of}} waste from its beginning to end in the context of Buenos Aires. In the thesis I thus follow the life of garbage through its different stages, from its place of origin to its place of destruction or recycling. While numerous scientists study consumption, very few study garbage. This is somewhat of a paradox since garbage is a logical corollary of consumption: all that is consumed eventually turns into to garbage. By focusing on the social life of waste the thesis examines the involvement and interconnectedness of different sets of actors who are involved in the production and processing of waste. I explore the practices, perceptions and relations of and among local cartoneros or recyclers; the middle class residents in a Buenos Aires neighbourhood; various NGOs working for a better, cleaner and safer city; as well as various government bodies. The first part of the thesis analyses cartoneros as contested category. Cartoneros make a decent living in the (semi) informal garbage economy in a context of economic recession, and some of them even do it with pride. Yet their association with garbage means that they are perceived as a <b>polluted</b> <b>matter</b> out of place, and cartoneros are therefore often stigmatised by other residents of the Argentinean capital. Occasionally, however, they are also met with signs of empathy and even solidarity. Among the middle class in particular, empathy towards the poor and a desire to be seen as ‘doing good’ creates a motivation to recycle, as middle class residents willingly let ‘their’ waste become the cartoneros’ livelihood. Lastly, the thesis adopts a more macro-structural perspective on waste management, and analyses the links and conflicts between the cartoneros and the local state and administration. As a consequence of weak implementation of environmental legislation and recycling laws, corruption and general state indifference towards the plight of the cartoneros, the latter are often deeply distrustful of the local state. While many cartoneros therefore prefer to get by without the state, poor administrative performance and a generalised distrust between the recyclers and the state create a number of barriers to a better and more efficient system of waster management in Buenos Aires...|$|E

The Courts have interpreted Article 21 of the Constitution right to life encompassing the right to safe and sufficient water. Water pollution in India has {{a wide range of}} causes. Forty second amendment to the Constitution of India introduced certain significant provisions relating to environment protection. The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 (Water Act) was passed by Indian Parliament, under article 252 of the Indian Constitution. All the States have approved implementation of the Water Act as enacted in 1974. The Act now applies to all the States and Union Territories.

40|$|Particulate {{organic matter}} {{concentrations}} determined at the outlet of a low-sloped combined sewer are observed to increase {{significantly in the}} very early stage of storm runoff events. It is found {{that this is not a}} result from scouring of actual deposited sediments in the sewer (which are granular), but from the dynamic behaviour of a distinct component of the sewage flow itself. During low flows in dry weather, a part of the coarsest material present in normal sanitary sewage (primarily organic debris such as human and food wastes, of about millimetric size and larger) settles and leaves the main body of the flow, but does not reach the sewer bottom to deposit there. The lowest part of the flowing sewage acts in this case as a temporary storage of highly <b>polluting</b> <b>matter,</b> as its longitudinal velocity is lower than the one of the remaining flow. An explanation for the building of these 'dense undercurrents' is formulated, based on a difference between free settling in the main body of flow and hindered settling near the bottom. Although this still merits further confirmation, it is likely that the process which maintains coarse solids in suspension in the undercurrent is a lift force induced by shear in the near-bed zone. The collapse of the undercurrent and the subsequent release of polluting material into the whole water column has been observed in the considered sewer to occur when bed shear stress exceeds about 1. 1 - 1. 2 N/m 2. This low value can explain flushing effects occurring frequently during rainy period, or even at peak dry weather flows. On the basis of properties illustrated in this study, a number of management options can be considered for revised day-to-day operation of low-sloped interceptor sewers where dense undercurrents are likely to develop.

Le flux de filtration varie entre 15 l/h. m 2 pour l'effluent de printemps et 90 l/h. m 2 pour l'effluent d'été.

The {{leather industry}} {{is responsible for}} the transformation of raw animal skin to a final form as shoes, bags, dresses, etc. This industry was known for centuries as a craft activity, and today with industrial development, environmental regulations and new emerging technologies, it has become necessary to include elaborate processes for its wastewater treatment. These industries consume a great amount of water. In Tunisia, more than 15000 tons of skin are treated per year, and about 600000 m 3 per year of effluents are discharged. The waste water contains chemicals, fats, hair and protein, varying in composition depending on the season. Figure 1 represents the preparation of raw skin for the tanning operation and the amount of waste water produced. The amount of water used for the preparation of raw skin is about 70 % of the total quantity of water used. This waste water has a significant polluting load (chemicals and organic matter), with 5000 - 7500 mg/l of COD and 100 to 150 mg/l of sulfur. Tunisian legislation and regulations concerning the standards for wastewater disposal are 1000 mg/l for COD, 3 mg/l for sulfur and a pH between 6. 5 - 9. Different techniques for wastewater treatment such as: physico-chemical treatment, treatment by electrochemical oxidation and membrane technology were proposed. Wastewater treatment by microfiltration and ultrafiltration with mineral membranes is advantageous because no chemicals are used and it can be combined easily with other physico-chemical or biological pre-treatments. In this study, we have treated two types of effluents from the leather pre-treatment industry collected in the summer (effluent 1), and the spring (effluent 2) seasons. The physico-chemical characteristics of the two types effluents are given in Table 2. The filtration experiments were made on a test bench (Figure 2) equipped with a feed reservoir, a volumetric pump, a filtration module, flow meter, pressure transducers, a heat exchanger and control valves. Ceramic membranes of tubular geometry (7 channels), 0. 08 m 2 membrane surface area and of 0. 1 µm (mean diameter) pores were used. During the microfiltration experiments, the following physico-chemical parameters were analysed in the permeate and retentate: turbidity, specific conductivity, pH, viscosity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), sulfur (volumetric method), fats (Standard JIS 0102. 24. 2), protein (using Kjeldahl nitrogen), and organic nitrogen. Hydrodynamic parameters such as temperature (25 < T < 50 °C), transmembrane pressure (1 < Ptm < 2. 2 bar) and feed velocity (1 < U < 3 m/s) were fixed for experimentation. The COD concentration in the effluent was adjusted and kept constant at 5000 mg/l. The raw effluent was pre-filtered on a screen filter (150 µm pore size). For experiments with variable concentration, we regularly removed the filtrate and the concentration factor was represented by FCV=Vi / Vr, where Vi was the initial volume and Vr was the volume of the retentate. The performance of the microfiltration (J) was expressed in l/h×m 2. The retention rate (TR) was defined by: TR= 1 - (Cpermeate) / (Cfeed). The total hydraulic resistance (RT) was defined by Darcy's law: Jf=Ptm / µ RT. After each experiment, the membrane was regenerated following a standard protocol and it was verified by measuring water flux. Figure 3 a represents the variation of the filtration flux with time for 4 different temperatures: 25 °C, 43 °C, 45 °C and 50 °C with effluent 1. The flux increased from 90 to 118 l/h×m 2 when the temperature increased from 25 °C to 43 °C. After 90 min at 50 °C, the filtration flux was 123 l/h×m 2. Table 3 shows that the viscosity of the effluent decreased with temperature, while the turbidity of the filtrate increased from 0. 63 NTU at T= 25 °C to 1. 6 NTU for T= 50 °C. The retention rate of COD was always superior to 50 %. On the basis of these results, we chose the optimum temperature of 43 °C for other experiments. Figure 4 summarises the variation of flux with transmembrane pressure at flow velocities of 1 m/s, 2 m/s and 3 m/s. The stabilized fluxes were practically the same for the flow velocities of 1 and 2 m/s (of the order of 80 l/h×m 2), but were higher at 3 m/s (110 - 115 l/h×m 2 at 2 bar). The physico-chemical characteristics of the raw effluent and the permeate obtained after 90 minutes of filtration are summarised in Table 4. Figure 7 a shows the variation of filtration flux for 2 types of effluents. The filtration flux for the same conditions of experimentation and at stabilized conditions (at 90 min) was 118 l/h×m 2 for effluent 1 and 20 l/h×m 2 for effluent 2. The lower filtration flux for effluent 2 can be explained by high deposits of rejected matter on the membrane and in the pores. Table 5 gives a comparison of the characteristics of effluents 1 and 2 before and after microfiltration. At variable feed concentrations, FCV= 6. 5 for effluent 1 and FCV= 2. 4 for the effluent 2 and the stabilized flux was about 90 l/h×m 2 for the effluent 1 and 15 l/h×m 2 for the effluent 2. The time needed for treatment of effluent 1 was about 6 hours, while more that 16 hours was necessary for effluent 2. Table 6 provides physico-chemical characteristics for the two types of effluents. The contents of fat, protein, nitrogen and sulfur in the effluent were important factors for variation. These results indicate that microfiltration is very sensitive to the quantity of <b>polluting</b> <b>matter</b> present in the effluents, particularly sulfur and fat. Increased <b>polluting</b> <b>matter</b> in effluent 2 could be responsible for the membrane polarization and blocking of pores. The resistance model was used to verify this hypothesis. The irreversible resistance values for effluent 2 were greater, thus confirming the hypothesis that the increased adsorption on the membrane surface and passage of pores by the presence of sulfur and organic <b>polluting</b> <b>matter.</b> These experimental results confirm that the best performance can be obtained at the hydrodynamic conditions of: a temperature of 43 °C; a transmembrane pressure of 2 bar; and a flow velocity of 3 m/s. Seasonal variation changed the quality of effluents, which considerably affects the performances of the microfiltration. Effluent 2, which was obtained from the treatment of sheep skin during the spring season, led to more membrane pore blocking than effluent 1 for the same initial concentration in COD.

The observed r-process enhanced stars around [Fe/H] ∼ - 3 are reproduced if the star formation efficiency is lower for low-mass galaxies under a realistic delay time distribution for NSMs. We show that a significant fraction of NSM ejecta escape from its host proto-galaxy to <b>pollute</b> intergalactic <b>matter</b> and other proto-galaxies. The propagation of r-process elements over proto-galaxies changes the abundance distribution at [Fe/H] < - 3 and obtains distribution compatible with observations of the Milky Way halo stars. In particular, the pre-enrichment of intergalactic medium explains the observed scarcity of EMP stars without Ba and abundance distribution of r-process elements at [Fe/H] ≲ - 3. 5.

40|$|Chemical {{fertilizers}} {{need to be}} used {{according to}} the natural fertility of the soil, to the ecological conditions and the cultivation requirements for nourishing elements. Keeping this in mind, they will not have any negative effects over the surrounding environment. But if the optimal doses are not respected the soil will be <b>polluted.</b> Regarding this <b>matter</b> a study has been made that showed that if the correct dosage is not respected this {{could lead to the}} acidification of the soil to such a level that it won’t be suitable for agricultural purposes. Even if excess usage of fertilizers does not cause any changes in the soils texture, it can still contribute to its pure quality. If the correct dosage and the period of administration is respected than the soil will be improved with nourishing elements, this leading to a better agricultural production...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn public {{debates on}} climate change, {{environmental}} and economic value are often seen as standing in contradiction. This chapter examines regulatory and entrepreneurial attempts to reconcile {{environmental and economic}} value by turning <b>polluting</b> substances into <b>matters</b> of worth. Our case focuses on animal slurry in agriculture – a hybrid valuation object which produces both ammonia emissions in the atmosphere and fertilizer for the farm’s crops. Following the implementation of regulation aiming to reduce ammonia emissions from livestock farming, entrepreneurs have introduced new technologies to clean and thus valorize slurry; {{the construction of a}} market for such “clean” technologies has in turn raised the issue of how their value can be demonstrated and measured. We analyze the valuation work performed by regulators (the Danish Environmental Protection Agency) and entrepreneurs (a start-up that developed a solution for cleaning slurry), and contrast different modes of reconciling environmental and economic value...|$|R
40|$|Nucleosynthesis is {{the science}} related to all astrophysical {{processes}} which {{are responsible for}} the abundances of the elements and their isotopes in the universe. The astrophysical sites are the big bang and stellar objects. The working of nucleosynthesis processes is presented in a survey of events which act as abundance sources. For intermediate-mass and heavy elements, these are stellar evolution, type Ia and core collapse supernovae as well as hypernovae. We discuss successes and failures of existing processes and possible solutions via new (hitherto unknown) processes. Finally an analysis of their role is given in the puzzle to explain the evolution of the elemental and isotopic compositions found in galaxies, and especially the mixture found in the solar system. Different timescales due to the progenitor mass dependence of the endpoints of stellar evolution (type II supernova explosions — SNe II vs. planetary nebulae) or single vs. binary stellar systems (the latter being responsible for novae, type Ia supernovae — SNe Ia, or X-ray bursts) are the keys to understand galactic evolution. At very early times, the role of explosion energies of events, <b>polluting</b> pristine <b>matter</b> with a composition originating only from the big bang, might also play a role. We also speculate on the role of very massive stars not undergoing SN II explosions but rather causing “hypernovae” after the formation of a central black hole via core collapse.

40|$|Intense {{coloring}} due to {{the presence}} of the non biodegradable dyes, often toxic, in industrial wastewater, enormously poses problems of degradation of the receiving medium (i. e. surface waters). This study relates to the control of pollution of the industrial wastewater with physicochemical treatment by using an industrial waste rich in ferric chloride like original coagulant. This was tested for the control of pollution of the liquid effluents from the textile industry strongly <b>polluted</b> with organic <b>matter.</b> Several parameters were selected to control the purification of our effluents: turbidity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), and volume of sludge. The optimal concentration of the coagulant used in this treatment varies from one waste to another, according to the polluting load to treat. The output of this physicochemical treatment shows an important reduction of the polluting load of textile wastewaters: 91 – 87 % of the organic matter and 84 – 85 % of suspended solids, with less sludge production...|$|R
40|$|At present, {{aquaculture}} {{of black}} tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) in the Puttalam district of Sri Lanka is unsustainable {{with more than}} 90 % of the former shrimp ponds laying abandoned {{as a result of}} shrimp disease and improper management. Between 1992 - 1998, over 50 % of the mangrove cover was removed in order to establish shrimp aquaculture. This severely affected the functioning of coastal ecosystems, reducing their provision of useful services and increasing coastal vulnerability to climate change. Changes in the hydrology and <b>polluted</b> residual <b>matter</b> make the soil unsuitable for other agricultural purposes without costly restoration. The root of the problem was inappropriate management and a focus on short term economic gains. Despite this previous failure, the national development plan, Mahinda Chinthana, now promotes aquaculture as an avenue for development. This will only be possible if aquaculture is regulated in a sustainable and well-managed manner, and does not increase local vulnerability to climate change effects. The current paper discusses the possible costs and benefits in applying the concept of Climate Compatible Development (CCD) to shrimp aquaculture in Puttalam, Sri Lanka. It suggests how the sector can support mitigation of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions and adaptation to climate change effects, whilst stimulating development that will also benefit rural societies. Mechanisms that could enable this change include subsidies, insurance and bank loans which will also facilitate investment by foreign private enterprises and subsequent export. The development of a specific aquaculture policy and master plan would facilitate the process further...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{the benefit}} of using {{photocatalysis}} as a pretreatment step for a subsequent olive mill wastewater (OMW) treatment process by membranes will be discussed. Membrane processes appear to be suitable to purify aqueous wastewater streams <b>polluted</b> by organic <b>matter</b> such as OMW, but suffer severe fouling. In order to avoid fouling, the use of operating conditions below the boundary flux is suggested. The problem is that in many cases, boundary flux values are extremely low, making the process economically not feasible. In order to overcome this limitation, pretreatment steps are necessary to increase boundary flux values accordingly. Photocatalysis appears to be capable to achieve these requirements: on one hand, the process is capable to reduce the organic load of the feedstock {{and on the other}} hand, particle size distributions of the suspended organic matter are changed. Both principles are known in literature to lead to boundary flux value changes. In this paper the authors report the obtained results of the experimental work concerning photocatalysis and membrane performances...|$|R
