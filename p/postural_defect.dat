40|$|Background: Weight-shifting {{exercise}} was empirically practised in correcting the biased posture {{of people with}} stroke-induced hemiplegia. Objectives: (1) Evaluate the loading symmetry at the buttock-seat interface {{as a reflection of}} a <b>postural</b> <b>defect</b> in sitting. (2) Investigate if weight-shifting exercises could correct the postural problem of people with hemiplegia. Design: Control group design. Participants: 16 subjects with hemiplegia after stroke and 14 healthy individuals. Procedures: Subjects were assessed for buttock-seat interface loading while in erect sitting using a seat pressure mapping system. Subjects with stroke then practised one session of weight-shifting exercise followed by a reassessment. Results: The subjects with hemiplegia, particularly those with right hemisphere lesion, had more load borne at the buttock ipsilateral to the side of stroke lesion. The weight-shifting exercise did not produce an immediate improvement on the loading asymmetry. Conclusion: The exercise would require further investigation to clarify its benefits in treating postural problems after stroke. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|E

Materials and Methods: 30 non-athletic females (aged 18 - 22 yrs) who suffered from hamstringshortness were participated in the study. They have been assigned in one of the two experimental groups:vibration group (3 times a week for 8 weeks) and control group (no intervention). The subjects in bothgroups were not allowed to perform any sport activity during 8 weeks of study. Before and after theintervention, the rate of hamstring muscle shortness was evaluated by passive knee extension (PKE) test. Results: The findings showed that hamstring muscle length was increased significantly in the vibrationgroup (p= 0. 000), in term of decrease of knee joint angle during PKE test. While no significant changewas found from the control group (p= 0. 181). Also vibration raised muscle flexibility on average 15 unitswhile in control group it was only 0. 73.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} problem of faulty posture at {{preschool}} children {{and influence of}} this process through the physiotherapy. The theoretical part describes faulty posture including trends in the incidence, the position of individual human body segments, deep stabilization system and ontogenetic development from birth {{until the end of}} preschool period. Part of theoretical part also includes a list of appropriate physiotherapy techniques. Faulty posture is caused by muscular imbalance in the form of weakening of the muscles on one side and increased muscle tension on the other side. There are not anatomical abnormalities at faulty posture in contrast to structural failures so it is possible to correct this <b>postural</b> <b>defect.</b> Examination of postural functions in the preschool period is complicated because some developmental abnormalities are physiological in childhood. Therefore, {{it is difficult to determine}} which abnormality is appropriate to correct. Preschool period starts at the age of three and ends at the age of six or seven. An imitation of close persons is typical in this period. A lot of children stay in kindergartens which can be source of various risks. In case of insufficient development of movement skills and coordination of movement, one-sided stress or lack of spontaneous physical aktivity these risks may be reflected in the form of faulty posture. Qualitative research methods have been selected for the practical part. Data was obtained through two case studies that include medical history, along with kinesiology analysis. The research group consisted of preschool children diagnosed with faulty posture. The probands were selected from the Dětské rehabilitační centrum Lentilka in Pardubice. Based on the results of the examination, there were prepared individual exercises which were used at home.

The present study therefore aimed to investigate the frequency of <b>postural</b> <b>defects,</b> evaluating and comparing quarter horses in sports modalities of cutting and team penning. The posture of 30 quarter horses from the Sérgio Martins Stud in Uberlândia was evaluated, of which 20 practiced cutting and the remaining 10 did team penning. The animals’ posture was examined by visual evaluation, which involved three views, the cranial, lateral and caudal. The distribution of frequency and statistical analysis were carried out using Fisher's Exact Test. In the cranial view, the defects found were open and closed posture at the front and knock-knees. The lateral view identified the following defects; leaning forward, buck-knees and camped back. From the caudal view, the defects found were open and closed hind posture and cow-hocks.

40|$|Objective : To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of pain in the musculoskeletal system and possible reasons for these complaints among early age children from Warsaw schools. Material and methods: The {{study was conducted in}} 34 randomly selected primary schools in Warsaw in 2011. 2748 survey-questionnaires were given to parents or legal guardians by children. Of these, 1509 surveys were subject to a final analysis. The survey included 66 questions regarding, among other things, pain in the musculoskeletal system in children. Additionally, there were questions about possibly occurring diseases, any postural defects, significant obesity, as well as effects of these complaints on the child’s physical activity. Survey data regarded 6 – 7 -year-old children. Results: In the group of 1509 respondents, 242 children (16 %) complained about pain in the musculoskeletal system. Pain was located most frequently in the knee joints, and more rarely in the spine and joints in the upper extremities. In the group of children who complained about pain, moderate physical activity was statistically significantly limited. According to parents, physicians did not diagnose any medical conditions in 106 children. Joint disease was diagnosed in 33 children. Postural defects were diagnosed in 589 children. In 123 children complaining about pain at least one <b>postural</b> <b>defect</b> was diagnosed. Such defects were diagnosed statistically significantly more rarely (p = 0. 011) in 1234 children who did not complain about pain (460 children). Platypodia or other foot deformation was observed in 25 % of these children, spinal curvature in 12 %, abnormal knee joint position in 11 % and uneven hip position in 2 % children. Of note, 17 % of all children were significantly overweight. In overweight children {{the prevalence of}} pain, especially in the knee joints and feet, was significantly higher.

40|$|What is {{the ideal}} human upright posture? Where did it come from, how did it develop, what is its significance, how is it measured? What are the cause and effect of malposture? Much has been {{published}} {{on the role of}} posture in physical as well as mental and emotional states of the individual. This study was undertaken to investigate these issues, {{while at the same time}} aiming to find the position and role of posture in the physical and psychological context of human life. The first aspect of posture investigated was its definition. What constitutes good posture is still a debated issue. The conclusion drawn was that good posture represents the state of balance in an individual at rest and during motion. Ideally this state should be achieved with all the body parts aligned on top of each other requiring minimal effort and energy expenditure. The evolutionary origin of the upright posture in man was traced in order to come to a clearer understanding of the anatomical, biomechanical and physiological mechanisms involved in posture. The positions and functions of some muscles and bones have remained, and some have changed during the development of the upright human from its quadrupedal ancestors. Maintenance of balanced posture depends mainly on the coordinated action of the stabilizing mono-articulated muscles, and their place and purpose in upright man were viewed in the light of their origins. By so doing one is able to uncover their intended use and to identify misuse of these muscles. Development throughout childhood mimics the evolutionary process. A series of postural exercises was described, which follows the childhood/evolutionary pattern, and have proven to be successful in postural rehabilitation and body¬mind integration. In order to understand the concept of the upright standing posture, control mechanisms responsible for maintaining upright posture were reviewed. These included the sensory and the neuromusculo-skeletal systems. This was duly undertaken in accordance with existing literature, it was concluded that posture is controlled in association with all human functions. Following the concept that posture affects the mind and emotions, the work and theories of prominent researchers in the body-mind and postural integration field such as Frederick Alexander, Raymond Dart, Moshe Feldenkrais, Alexander Lowen, Wilhelm Reich and Ida Rolf were reviewed and distilled. This led to evidence that treatment of the body has an effect on the mind, that structure influences function and that postural equilibrium has a beneficial influence on both mind and body. According to numerous workers malposture in man is pandemic. Ensuing literature and empirical research on total body posture, and the position of each area of the body, from the head to the feet, revealed divergent causes of this problem as well as effects of malposture, including negative self-image, psycholological problems, pain, fatigue and the inability to achieve the full human potential. Although there is no obvious cause of postural imbalance, there are many ways of preventing or rectifying the disorder. During the course of a postural rehabilitation therapy, there is a good chance of uncovering the underlying cause of the postural imbalance. This can be as deep seated as a personality disorder or as clear as the fear of an old sport injury. The incidence and extent of postural defects were investigated in two small groups of subjects with the aim to determine the range of postural deviations, and the body areas most commonly affected. All subjects studied, leaned forward with the gravity line anterior to the ankle joint. Postural defects were prevalent in all subjects. Most of the subjects were categorized as having severe postural defects or gross deformity. Postural asymmetry and kyphosis were the most common defects. The conclusions drawn from these studies were that most people, in any age group, suffer from some type of <b>postural</b> <b>defect,</b> supporting the general consensus that malposture is a pandemic condition. The effects of postural rehabilitation were also investigated. Postures improved in all the subjects over a period of twelve weeks, with a more vertical body alignment the most obvious change. Postural rehabilitation has physical and psychological consequences. This was demonstrated by improvement in posture and increased body awareness, a decrease in the tendency to become fatigued, an decrease in back and neck stiffness and improvement in mental attitudes. Postural training in general could therefore be profitable for both body and mind, and an appreciation of good posture and its resulting efficiency represents the best kind of preventative medicine. Postural training should have a place in both Education and Health. Thesis (D Phil (HMS)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007. Arts, Languages and Human Movement Studies EducationUnrestricte...|$|E

The main aim {{of the study was to}} assess potential differences in step initiation between 5 - and 6 -year-old children with faulty posture who had been diagnosed with neurodevelopmental disorders during infancy and healthy children. MethodsThe experimental group consisted of 19 children aged 5 – 6 [*]years with faulty posture, who had been diagnosed with neurodevelopmental disorders during infancy and were given physiotherapy in the first year of their lives. The control group comprised 19 nursery school children aged 5 – 6 [*]years with no <b>postural</b> <b>defects,</b> no history of postural control or movement deficits, and no physiotherapy interventions in the first year of their lives. Step initiation was performed on force platforms under various conditions, i. e., with and without an obstacle, stepping up onto a platform placed at a higher level, stepping down onto a platform placed on a lower level. The recording of center of foot pressure (COP) displacements was divided into three phases: phase 1 (P 1) —quiet standing before step initiation, phase 2 (P 2) —transit, phase 3 (P 3) —quiet standing until measurement completion. ResultsThe Tukey post hoc test showed that the means of sway range (raCOP) and mean velocity (vCOP) in sagittal (AP) plane for phase 1 and vCOP in frontal (ML) plane for phase 3 registered in the step-up trial were significantly higher (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) in children with faulty posture compared to children with typical development.

40|$|Manganese (manganese ion; {{referred}} to as Mn) is essential for neuronal function, yet it is toxic at high concentrations. Environmental and occupational exposure to high concentrations of Mn causes manganism, a well-defined movement disorder in humans, with symptoms resembling Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, manganism is distinct from PD and the neural basis of its pathology is poorly understood. To address this issue, we generated a zebrafish model of manganism by incubating larvae in rearing medium containing Mn. We find that Mn-treated zebrafish larvae exhibit specific <b>postural</b> and locomotor <b>defects.</b> Larvae begin to float on their sides, show a curved spine and swim in circles. We discovered that treatment with Mn causes <b>postural</b> <b>defects</b> by interfering with mechanotransduction at the neuromasts. Furthermore, {{we find that the}} circling locomotion could be caused by long-duration bursting in the motor neurons, which can lead to long-duration tail bends in the Mn-treated larvae. Mn-treated larvae also exhibited fewer startle movements. Additionally, we show that the intensity of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity is reversibly reduced after Mn-treatment. This led us to propose that reduced dopamine neuromodulation drives the changes in startle movements. To test this, when we supplied an external source of dopamine to Mn-treated larvae, the larvae exhibited a normal number of startle swims. Taken together, these results indicate that Mn interferes with neuronal function at the sensory, motor and modulatory levels, and open avenues for therapeutically targeted studies on the zebrafish model of manganism...|$|R

40|$|Summary Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a {{motor neuron}} {{degenerative}} disease {{characterized by a}} progressive, and ultimately fatal, muscle paralysis. The human VAMP-Associated Protein B (hVAPB) is the causative gene of ALS type 8. Previous {{studies have shown that}} a loss-of-function mechanism is responsible for VAPB-induced ALS. Recently, a novel mutation in hVAPB (V 234 I) has been identified but its pathogenic potential has not been assessed. We found that neuronal expression of the V 234 I mutant allele in Drosophila (DVAP-V 260 I) induces defects in synaptic structure and microtubule architecture that are opposite to those associated with DVAP mutants and transgenic expression of other ALS-linked alleles. Expression of DVAP-V 260 I also induces aggregate formation, reduced viability, wing <b>postural</b> <b>defects,</b> abnormal locomotion behavior, nuclear abnormalities, neurodegeneration and upregulation of the heat-shock-mediated stress response. Similar, albeit milder, phenotypes are associated with the overexpression of the wild-type protein. These data show that overexpressing the wild-type DVAP is sufficient to induce the disease and that DVAP-V 260 I is a pathogenic allele with increased wild-type activity.

The author emphasizes the meaning of wearing corrective footwear since proper foot positioning provided by special shoes cannot be the cause of spinal deformities. Conclusions: The spine-pelvis trait in the population of boys most frequently revealing significant influence on the feet traits is the height and depth of thoracic kyphosis. The foot trait among the population of boys living in cities most frequently revealing significant influence on the spine-pelvis traits was the value of the right foot length. In the rural population significant influence on the spine-pelvis traits was revealed by: the length and height of the fifth longitudinal arch of the left foot...|$|R
40|$|The high {{interchangeability}} of produced garments and {{the increased}} requirements towards the quality of production is conditioned by the growing individualization of orders, {{this is why it}} is important to perform systematically anthropometric researches of the modern female population for the purpose of revealing the peculiarities of constitution of the figures of this consumer group. During the researches, the existing classifications and data on the postures and types of body constitution of women were studied. The point of departure was the healthy human vertebral column and the position of human body in normal posture. The aspects of possible deviations from the normal body posture were studied. Taking into consideration the fact that various age groups were examined in the paper, various age-related modifications of the vertebral column and, thus, of the human posture were studied. To attain the established goal, anthropometric researches were performed on women of various age groups. The studied women were taken photos; using the photos, the figure contours were obtained, and the types of body constitutions and postures were studied according to the methods described in the special literature. The obtained data were analyzed and presented in graphic form for a more precise visualization of the results and for a more exact interpretation of those results. The result of the performed researches was the classification of <b>postural</b> <b>defects,</b> revealed in the frontal and sagittal planes, taking into consideration the eventual peculiarities of the individual figure of any age. This classification is meant to facilitate the work of the designers at the stage of projecting or when making corrections in the design of garments. ...|$|R
40|$|Background In Poland, about 85 % of the {{population}} report low back pain (LBP) symptoms overall. Moreover, 70 – 80 % of people aged below 20 have already experienced back pain. The primary cause of LBP {{is the loss of}} spinal lordosis, which initiates changes in geometry of the spine and has impact on limb arrangement. The aim {{of the study was to}} attempt to verify the relationship between the 2 main curvatures of the spine and its relation to symptoms in different parts of the musculoskeletal system, in a group of adults. It was assumed that hyperlordosis of the lumbar spine and misbalance of the thoraco-lumbar junction are risk factors for LBP. Material and Methods The study coverd 231 first-year students, (aged 19 – 21) of the University of Economics in Katowice. There were 103 men aged 19. 5 ± 0. 8 years and 128 women aged 19. 6 ± 0. 8 years. The students completed the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ) : 7 days (NMQ 7) and 6 months (NMQ 6). A Rippstein’s plurimeter, was used to measure the angles of thoracic kyphosis (KTH) and lumbar lordosis (KLL). Cut of points was set at 30 ± 5. Results The results indicate strong and very strong correlation (r = 0. 6 and r = 0. 8, p < 0. 05) between the concave of the back and LBP, which may suggest the relationship between these symptoms and the increased lordosis. Conclusions <b>Postural</b> <b>defects</b> in the sagittal plane may predict the occurrence of pain. The results of the study indicate a higher frequency of pain in people with a higher angle of lumbar lordosis. Med Pr 2018; 69 (1) : 29 – 3...|$|R
40|$|This review {{describes}} the oculo-visual problems {{likely to be}} encountered in Parkinson's disease (PD) with special reference to three questions: (1) are there visual symptoms characteristic of the prodromal phase of PD, (2) is PD dementia associated with specific visual changes, and (3) can visual symptoms help in the differential diagnosis of the parkinsonian syndromes, viz. PD, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) ? Oculo-visual dysfunction in PD can involve visual acuity, dynamic contrast sensitivity, colour discrimination, pupil reactivity, eye movement, motion perception, and visual processing speeds. In addition, disturbance of visuo-spatial orientation, facial recognition problems, and chronic visual hallucinations may be present. Prodromal features of PD may include autonomic system dysfunction potentially affecting pupil reactivity, abnormal colour vision, abnormal stereopsis associated with <b>postural</b> instability, <b>defects</b> in smooth pursuit eye movements, and deficits in visuo-motor adaptation, especially when accompanied by idiopathic rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder. PD dementia {{is associated with the}} exacerbation of many oculo-visual problems but those involving eye movements, visuo-spatial function, and visual hallucinations are most characteristic. Useful diagnostic features in differentiating the parkinsonian symptoms are the presence of visual hallucinations, visuo-spatial problems, and variation in saccadic eye movement dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Biokinetics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Hamstring {{injuries}} {{have a high}} prevalence in rugby union players. Delayed transverse abdominus activation as well as lordosis {{is associated}} with hamstring injuries. No literature regarding this relationship in rugby players could have been found. The main {{purpose of this study}} was therefore to determine the relationship between pelvic biomechanics (transverse abdominus activation and pelvis tilt) and gluteus maximus, hamstring and erector spinae activation patterns in semi–professional rugby union players as well as the relationship of the above mentioned variables and hamstring injuries. A total of 65 players voluntarily participated in this study. Pelvis tilt (left and right) was assessed by Dartfish version 4. 06. 0 (Dartfish, Switzerland). Transverse abdominus activation (TrA) was assessed by pressure biofeedback and the mean onset times of the left and right gluteus maximus (GM), biceps femoris (BF), semitendinosus (ST) and lumbar erector spinae (LES) was measured with electromyography (EMG). In order to determine the role of the pelvic biomechanics and activation patterns on hamstring injuries, players were retrospectively grouped in injured and uninjured groups. Differences between the groups were determined with regards to the variables determined. Activation patterns were determined by means of descriptive statistics. The between–group pelvic biomechanic (pelvic tilt and TrA) differences in the muscle (GM, LES and hamstrings) onset times were analysed by determining practical significance by means of effect sizes. An anterior pelvic tilt on the left side was observed in 64. 6 % of the participants and on the right side in 83. 1 % of the participants. TrA testing indicated that 68. 4 % of participants were classified with bad activation and 31. 6 % with good activation. No practical significant difference was found in the mean onset times of each muscle relative to the other in the normal and anterior tilted pelvis groups as well as in the bad and good TrA groups. A total of 24. 6 % of the rugby players previously suffered from hamstring injuries, 37. 5 % of those injured participants were suffering from re–injury. No practical significant between group differences were found when the injured and uninjured groups were compared with regards to anterior pelvis tilt values (d= 0. 061) and TrA values (d= 0. 189). EMG results on the right and left side of the injured and uninjured participants present a pattern of the following activation order: LES, GM, BF and lastly ST. No practical significant between groups differences were found in the onset times of the muscles relative to each other in the injured compared to uninjured groups. The conclusions that can be drawn from this study is that semi–professional rugby union players (injured and uninjured) are prone to <b>postural</b> <b>defects</b> such as anterior tilt of the pelvis and bad TrA. Anterior pelvic tilt and bad TrA may be the reason for the earlier activation of the LES and hamstrings muscles relative to the GM in the prone hip extension to stabilize the lumbar spine. These activation patterns were however not influenced by previous hamstring injuries. Master...|$|R
