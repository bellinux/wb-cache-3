This gave the AT engineers a new insight into the way their filters were working and led Otto Zobel to invent many improved forms. Carson and Zobel steadily demolished many of the old ideas.

Another advance concerned the nature of noise, Carson and Zobel (1923) treated noise as a random process with a continuous bandwidth, an idea that was well ahead of its time, and thus limited the amount of noise {{that it was possible to}} remove by filtering to that part of the noise spectrum which fell outside the passband. This too, was not generally accepted at first, notably being opposed by Edwin Armstrong (who ironically, actually succeeded in reducing noise with wide-band FM) and was only finally settled with the work of Harry Nyquist whose thermal noise <b>power</b> <b>formula</b> is well known today.|$|E

This study derived a formula by taking several AN measurements under heavy rain conditions, using multiple conductor bundles in a UHV corona cage, and then subjecting these measured values to least squares fitting. The validity of the proposed formula was subsequently verified with statistical data obtained from two long-term stations at Henan and Hubei Province, which are located under the Jindongnan-Nanyang-Jingmen UHV AC transmission lines operating at 1000 kV. The deviation between the prediction and the long-term (L 50) value was 0. 76 dB for the Henan station and 0. 17 dB for the Hubei station.
