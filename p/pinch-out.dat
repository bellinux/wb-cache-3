This fault is a reverse right-oblique fault. It is most known for the Whittier, Brea-Olinda, Sansinena, oil fields. There is an anticline that runs parallel to the Whittier fault that is evidence for compressional deformation during the late Miocene to early Pliocene.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to study two Basins of the Gulf of Guinea (GoG), namely the Dahomey and the Liberian Basins. These Basins {{are located in the}} northern part of the GoG, where oil and gas exploration has significantly increased in the last 10 years or so. We proposed geological descriptions of these two Basins. The key characteristics of the two models are the presence of channels and <b>pinch-outs</b> for depths of between 1 km and 2 km (these values are rescaled for our numerical purposes to 600 - m and 700 -m depths) and normal faults below 3 km (for our numerical purposes we use 1 km instead of 3 km). We showed that these models are consistent with the plate tectonics of the region, and the types of rocks and ages of rocks in these areas. Furthermore, we numerically generated seismic data for these two models and depth-migrated them. We then interpreted the migrated images under the assumption that the geologies are unknown. The conclusions of our interpretations are that we can see clearly the fault systems in both models. However, our results suggest that seismic interpretations of the channels and <b>pinch-outs</b> associated with the geology of the Dahomey and Liberian Basins will generally be difficult to identify. In these particular cases, we missed a number of channels and <b>pinch-outs</b> in our interpretations. The limited resolution of seismic images is the key reason for this misinterpretation...|$|R

50|$|All of the Spraberry Trend {{oil fields}} produce {{from a single}} {{enormous}} sedimentary unit known as the Spraberry Sand, which consists of complexly mixed fine sandstone and calcareous or silicate mudstone and siltstone, deposited in a deep water environment distinguished by channel systems and their associated submarine fans, all of Permian age. The sands are interbedded with shales, and typically <b>pinch-out</b> updip. Unlike many of the oil-bearing rocks of West Texas, however, the Spraberry Sands have very low porosity and permeability, both of which hamper oil recovery. The rocks are naturally fractured, further complicating hydrocarbon flow. Oil has accumulated in stratigraphic traps, migrating upward from source rocks until encountering impermeable barriers, either in the internal shaly members or the overlying impermeable formation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{uppermost}} producing {{unit was}} the first to be discovered, and consists of oil-bearing structures called the Wolfskill Zone, within the Repetto Sands, a Pliocene-age feature principally {{in the western part of}} the field. Oil in these sands is mainly found in <b>pinch-out</b> structures, in which oil is trapped in more permeable sub-units within impermeable sands. Underneath this unit, separated by an unconformity, is the larger Modelo Formation, consisting of several sand units: the D/M Sands (the topmost), the Hauser Sand, around 4500 ft below sea level, and the Ogden Sand, around 7200 ft below sea level. Beneath the Ogden Sand is a nodular shale unit, also grouped with the Modelo; it contains no oil. Both the Ogden and the Hauser are richly productive, while a few oil-bearing pinch-outs are found in the D/M sand, which otherwise forms an impermeable cap to the Hauser. [...] The deepest unit in the field which is being pumped is a portion of the Ogden Sands in the East Area of the field, discovered in 1967, which is at an average depth of 10800 ft.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we present digital images and sedimentological data from a channel fill {{succession}} in the Italian Apennines that is dominated by massive sandstones. Although the studied outcrop is largely inaccessible, valuable data have now been obtained using the new technique of ‘digiscoping’, which allows features of 1 m thick, with overall sandstone : shale ratios of 9 : 1. Massive sandstones are poorly sorted and overall show little or no normal grading. They are commonly amalgamated and always have sharp bed tops. Massive sandstone beds show abrupt <b>pinch-outs</b> at the channel margin, whereas overlying thin-bedded siltstone/mudstone layers taper gradually and drape up the margin more extensively. This suggests that the depositing flows were stratified into a lower, thin, (hyper) concentrated density flow and an upper, more dilute, turbidity current.

40|$|Gas {{production}} from low-permeability (tight) gas sandstones is increasingly {{important in the}} USA as conventional gas reservoirs are being depleted, and its importance will increase worldwide in future decades. Travis Peak tight sandstones have produced gas since the 1940 s. In this study, well log, 2 D seismic, core, and production data were {{used to evaluate the}} geologic setting and reservoir characteristics of the Travis Peak formation. The primary objective was to assess the potential for basinward extension of Travis Peak gas production along the west margin of the East Texas Basin. Along the west margin of the East Texas Basin, southeast-trending Travis Peak sandstones belts were deposited by the Ancestral Red River fluvial-deltaic system. The sandstones are fine-grained, moderately well sorted, subangular to subrounded, quartz arenites and subarkoses; reservoir quality decreases with depth, primarily due to diagenetic quartz overgrowths. Evaluation of drilling mud densities suggests that strata deeper than 12, 500 ft may be overpressured. Assessment of the geothermal gradient (1. 6 ?F/ 100 ft) indicates that overpressure may be relict, resulting from hydrocarbon generation by Smackover and Bossier formation potential source rocks. In the study area, Travis Peak cumulative gas production was 1. 43 trillion cubic feet from January 1, 1961, through December 31, 2005. Mean daily gas {{production from}} 923 wells was 925, 000 cubic ft/well/day, during the best year of production. The number of Travis Peak gas wells in ?high-cost? (tight sandstone) fields increased from 18 in the decade 1966 - 75 to 333 in the decade 1996 - 2005, when high-cost fields accounted for 33. 2 % of the Travis Peak gas production. However, 2005 gas production from high cost fields accounted for 63. 2 % of the Travis Peak total production, indicating that production from high-cost gas wells has increased markedly. Along the west margin of the East Texas Basin, hydrocarbon occurs in structural, stratigraphic, and combination traps associated with salt deformation. Downdip extension of Travis Peak production will depend on the (1) burial history and diagenesis, (2) reservoir sedimentary facies, and (3) structural setting. Potential Travis Peak hydrocarbon plays include: updip <b>pinch-outs</b> of sandstones; sandstone <b>pinch-outs</b> at margins of salt-withdrawal basins; domal traps above salt structures; and deepwater sands...|$|R
40|$|Enhancement of diffractions {{and their}} use to resolve fine-scale details in a seismic image is {{increasingly}} important. Diffractions carry useful information about small-scale characteristics of the subsurface associated with features such as faults, <b>pinch-outs,</b> stratigraphic variations, and other geologic features linked to hydrocarbon reservoirs. Extracting the information content of diffractions and forming {{an image of the}} features they illuminate are not trivial tasks. The conventional approach relies on seismic migration, or modifications of seismic migration, and is thus limited by the Rayleigh criterion. The limited aperture and finite bandwidth make it difficult to extract all the potential information content. An alternative approach that overcomes such limitations is to turn to signal processing approaches, which extract information from the structure of the data with the aim of detecting and characterizing a finite number of desired events. Our interest is in diffractions, so we used a windowed or steered version of the MUltiple SIgnal Classification method.

40|$|Stratigraphic {{trapping}} at <b>pinch-out</b> margins is a {{key feature}} of many turbidite-hosted hydrocarbon reservoirs. In systems confined by lateral or oblique frontal slopes, outcrop studies {{show that there is}} a continuum between two geometries of <b>pinch-out</b> configuration. In type A, turbidites thin onto the confining surface—although the final sandstone <b>pinch-out</b> is commonly abrupt—and individual beds tend not to erode into earlier deposits. In type B, turbidite sandstones commonly thicken toward the confining slope, and beds may incise into earlier deposits. These two types may occur in combination, to give a wide spectrum of <b>pinch-out</b> characteristics. Our analysis suggests the principal control in determining <b>pinch-out</b> character is flow magnitude, with smaller flows producing type A and larger flows producing type B. In areas of poor seismic control {{it can be difficult to}} assess either <b>pinch-out</b> character or the proximity of wells to confining slopes. Because estimates of paleoflow magnitude can be made from core or high-quality log image data, however, it is possible to make reasonable estimates of <b>pinch-out</b> character even from wells such as exploration wells, which may be placed conservatively, away from the field margins. Furthermore, systematic paleoflow variations and thickness trends are commonly seen in individual turbidite sandstones as they approach confining slopes. For example, dispersal directions indicate flow deflection parallel with the strike of confining topography; beds thin toward type A onlaps and thicken toward type Bonlaps. These relationships can be exploited via analysis of vertical successions to constrain well position with respect to the slope. Similarly, the presence, location, and frequency of locally derived debrites can provide information on the presence and proximity of confining slopes...|$|E

Inversion-based data processing methods are applied for the determination of geometrical and physical parameters of the target model. The use of this geoelectric inversion method is advantageous in environmental research where highly reliable information with large spatial resolution is required. The 2 D combined geoelectric inversion (CGI) method performs more accurate parameter estimation than conventional 1 D single inversion methods by efficiently decreasing the number of unknowns of the inverse problem (single means that data sets of individual vertical electric sounding stations are inverted separately). The quality improvement in parameter space is demonstrated by comparing the traditional 1 D inversion procedure with a 2 D series expansionbased inversion technique. The CGI method was further developed by weighting individual direct current geoelectric data sets automatically {{in order to improve}} inversion results. The new algorithm was named combined geoelectric weighted inversion, which extracts the solution by a special weighted least squares technique.

There are different static capacity estimation methods in use for closed systems and open systems. The method used has a significant impact on the final capacity estimate. The recent EU Directive (2009 / 31 /EC) stated that where more than one storage site within a single “hydraulic unit” (bounded aquifer volume) is being considered, the characterization process should account for potential pressure interactions.

40|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{multiscale}} methods have been proposed in the literature to reduce runtime and provide better scaling for the solution of Poisson-type equations modeling flow in porous media. We present a new multiscale restricted-smoothed basis (MsRSB) method {{that is designed to}} be applicable to both rectilinear grids and unstructured grids. Like many other multiscale meth-ods, MsRSB relies on a coarse partition of the underlying fine grid and a set of local prolongation operators (multiscale basis functions) that map unknowns associated with the fine grid cells to un-knowns associated with blocks in the coarse partition. These mappings are constructed by restricted smoothing: Starting from a constant, a localized iterative scheme is applied directly to the fine-scale discretization to compute prolongation operators that are consistent with the local properties of the differential operators. The resulting method has three main advantages: First of all, both the coarse and the fine grid can have general polyhedral geometry and unstructured topology. This means that partitions and good prolongation operators can easily be constructed for complex models involving high media contrasts and unstructured cell connections introduced by faults, <b>pinch-outs,</b> erosion, local grid refinement, etc. In particular, the coarse partition can be adapted to geological or flow-field properties represente...|$|R

We have developed a system to represent the distribution of seismic properties in the Earth that can accommodate {{a wide range of}} local to global scale 3 D Earth models with spatially variable resolution. A 2 D grid of nodes is tessellated using either triangles or quadrilaterals and a profile is defined at each 2 D grid node that extends {{from the center of the}} Earth to the surface.

The traps, structure and stratigraphic, could be very subtle and complex and are therefore, difficult to map accurately. The degree of reliability and precision of the mapping can be greatly enhanced by integrating seismic data with well logs commonly used independently in hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation studies. In this paper, seismic data were integrated with well logs to define the subsurface geometry, stratigraphy and hydrocarbon trapping potential of Emi-field, off shore Niger Delta. Lithologic units were identified on the logs and correlated across the wells. The stratigraphic cross-sections produced show a general lateral continuity of the lithologic units across the field.

40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} some novel {{techniques}} for modeling sedimentation and compaction using fully unstructured meshes. The numerical modeling of the sedimentation {{process is a}} critical part of basin simulation and synthetic stratigraphy modeling. Normally, structured curvilinear meshes are used to represent sedimentary sequences to be deposited during the simulation. Using this approach, 2 D grids represent layers of newly deposited sediments of a sequence during the simulation. In simulations that involve compaction, the 3 D meshes are restricted to have vertical planes parallel to depth direction in order to accommodate the compaction calculation since most compaction algorithms in basin modeling are essentially one-dimensional. This kind of curvilinear mesh poses severe limitations to represent complex geological structures such as non-vertical faults, <b>pinch-outs</b> and salt domes. Unstructured meshes are much more flexible for representing complex geometry. We have developed new algorithms to use arbitrarily defined unstructured meshes for modeling numerically sedimentation and compaction in 2 D and 3 D. These algorithms (1) allow the generation of stratigraphic meshes by solving the Laplace equation to generate isosurfaces representing time lines that constrain the triangulation and (2) use a Streamline Upwind Finite Element formulation (SUPG) to calculate compaction during the simulation of evolving sedimentary basins. These algorithms have being applied with success in a 3 D multiphase fluid flow simulator that we are developing to handle complex geometries with distinct degrees of mesh refinement/resolution during the simulation...|$|R

Three tidal zones are recognized: (1) subtidal zone, consisting of sediments deposited below low tide (adjacent marine, channels, ponds); (2) intertidal zone, consisting of sediments deposited between ormal low and normal high tide (intertidal-flats); and (3) supratidal zone, consisting of sediments deposited above normal high tide but {{within the range of}} spring and storm tides (beach ridges, levees, marsh). The complex may {{be thought of as a}} river delta turned "inside out. " Most sediments that make up this delta have been transported via channel systems from the adjacent marine zone. Early diagenesis in the form of reduction, oxidation, dolomite formation, and carbonate cementation is also controlled by tide level.

40|$|The {{reservoir}} characterization {{process can be}} defined as the three-dimensional and quantitative determination of structure and petrophysical properties of the oil field. The use of 3 D seismic data in the {{reservoir characterization}} process has become more frequent mainly in the identification of the shape {{and the size of the}} sand bodies that constitute the reservoir. However, in some situations as the deep water turbidlte reservoirs of Campos Basin, that are characterized by a complex distribution of sand bodies and subseismic thickness, the use of the conventional seismic amplitude data can result in serious mistakes in the definition of reservoir model. To solve the problem of the vertical seismic resolution limitation, is necessary to build an integrated model that use all information available about the reservoir. The most effective way to integrate the seismic data in the reservoir characterization process is by using acoustic impedance models, obtained by seismic inversion, The aim of this work is to show how the seismic inversion to acoustic impedance can support and improve the characterization of the reservoirs, when comparing the results obtained by the application of two seismic inversion methods, the recursive inversion and the constrained sparse-spike inversion. The seismic inversion methods are applied in a wedge synthetic reference model, that represent some features find in the deep water turbidite reservoir, like stratigraphic thinning and <b>pinch-outs.</b> Based on these results we can see the advantages in use the seismic inversion methods in the determination of geometry of sand bodies and in the calculation of petrophysical properties, and as a consequence more accuracy models can be generated and the forecasts about the behavior of the field can be done in most effective way. © 2006 Sociedade Brasileira de Geofísica...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} sedimentologic and stratigraphic analysis facilitated {{interpretations of}} depositional environment, sequence stratigraphy, and sandstone body geometry for isolated, top-truncated, shallow marine sandstone {{bodies of the}} Upper Cretaceous (Cenomanian-Turonian) Frontier Formation, northeast Bighorn Basin, Wyoming. The Frontier Formation interval is ~ 160 meters thick and was deposited as a complex clastic wedge that prograded into Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway (KWIS). The vertical interval comprises several incomplete coarsening-upward cycles, composed of basal offshore marine and prodeltaic shales progressively overlain by proximal shallow marine/fluvial facies that are capped by pebble lags. Sedimentary structures, vertical stacking patterns, and lateral variability within these cycles record multiple southward progradational episodes of tide- and wave- influenced, fluvially-dominated deltas. Subsurface correlation of sandstone bodies reveals dip elongate, strike restricted, lensoid, digitate, linear, and lobate geometries, supporting the deltaic interpretation. A sequence stratigraphic analysis of outcrop sections divides the coarsening-upward cycles into multiple parasequences and identifies two types of key stratigraphic surface (transgressive surfaces of erosion, sequence boundaries). Transgressive surfaces of erosion occur as low-relief, laterally extensive pebble lag horizons that top-truncate parasequences, generating mudstone-encased, isolated sandstone bodies. Sequence boundaries are placed {{at the base of}} shallow marine sandstones (Peay Member), {{as well as at the}} erosional contact between fluvial and shallow marine facies (Torchlight Member). Sequence boundary placement suggests shoreline advancement basinward during relative sea-level lowstand. Relative sea-level transgressive-regressive cycles observed within parasequences were generated from the interplay between allogenic forces (tectonics, climate, eustacy). This study proposes a depositional model explaining the dispersal of southward-deflected, isolated shallow marine deposits 10 ’s to 100 ’s of kilometers basinward of contemporaneous shorelines. The interaction between fresh and saline water, pressure gradients, and the Coriolis Effect generated shore-parallel, southward-deflected geostrophic currents that dispersed sediments south, parallel to the KWIS western paleoshoreline. Additionally, this study highlights multiple member-scale lateral <b>pinch-outs</b> and intramember-scale heterogeneities in sandstone bodies. Such findings will assist in future hydrocarbon exploration efforts. Adviser: Christopher R. Fieldin...|$|R
30|$|The {{reservoirs}} in {{the study}} area could be described as calcareous quartz siltstones/sandstone within the N’kapa Formation due to the heterogeneous matrix which consists of fine-grained sand, limestone and dolomite. Petrophysical evaluation carried out on the wireline logs indicate four (4) reservoirs which are discontinuous and non correlatable across the entire wells. The identified reservoirs are probably thin stratigraphic sand beds which thin out and were deposited either as channel sands or as short turbiditic events characterizing the N’kapa Formation. All the reservoirs are hydrocarbon bearing with oil as the available phase in reservoir X 2 as suggested by the absence of the balloon effect and a density of 0.8. The reservoirs identified from petrophysical evaluation are discontinuous and non correlatable across the entire wells. They present average porosities, hydrocarbon-saturation and permeability in excess of 20 %, 69 % and 76  md, respectively, suggesting favourable petrophysical parameters for hydrocarbon accumulation and preservation based on the classification of (Rider 1986). They are probably thin stratigraphic carbonate prone sandy beds <b>pinch-outs</b> that were deposited either as channel sands or as short turbiditic events typical of the N’kapa Formation (Simon Petroleum Technology (SPT) 1995). The bulk volume water (BVW) values indicate that formation grain size ranges from fine grained to silty sands. BVW values calculated and plotted on crossplot as established by Asquith and Gibson (1982) are constant or closed to constant and parallel to the hyperbolic lines, thus suggesting that the reservoir are homogeneous and are at irreducible water saturation (Swirr) and hence will produce water-free hydrocarbon. When a reservoir is at Swirr, water will not move because it is held on grains by capillary pressure (Morris and Biggs 1967). Hydrocarbon production from a reservoir at Swirr should be water-free (Asquith and Krygowski 2004). The chlorite mineral could either be linked to detrital chlorite influx from neighbouring river sediments during fast deposition and/or probably formed diagenetically during early diagenesis of feldspar and mica sediments on the sea floor.|$|R
