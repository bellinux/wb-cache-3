5|$|General phylogenetic {{relationships}} within Timema (Law & Crespi, 2002). Species marked with ♀ are <b>parthenogenetic</b> (female only).|$|E
5|$|Five of the twenty-one {{species of}} Timema are <b>parthenogenetic,</b> {{including}} two species {{that have not}} engaged in sexual reproduction for one million years, the longest known asexual period for any insect.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches use pheromones {{to attract}} mates, and the males {{practice}} courtship rituals, such as posturing and stridulation. Like many insects, cockroaches mate {{facing away from}} each other with their genitalia in contact, and copulation can be prolonged. A few species are known to be <b>parthenogenetic,</b> reproducing without the need for males.|$|E
5|$|Arachnids are {{important}} to the forest ecology, as both predators and prey. In some forest types, such as tabonuco forest, they are the major arboreal invertebrate predators; spiders being the most abundant representative. The Maricao Commonwealth Forest's 27 spider species belong to five families: Uloboridae, Pholcidae, Theridiidae, Linyphiidae and Araneidae. Theotima minutissima, a small spider species found in abundance in the Caribbean National Forest, is believed to be <b>parthenogenetic,</b> meaning that it reproduces without fertilization by a male.|$|E
5|$|Gastrotrichs have {{a simple}} body plan with a head region, with a brain and sensory organs, and a trunk with a simple gut and the {{reproductive}} organs. They have adhesive glands with which they can anchor themselves to the substrate and cilia with which they move around. They feed on detritus, sucking up organic particles with their muscular pharynx. They are hermaphrodites, the marine species producing eggs which develop directly into miniature adults. The freshwater species are <b>parthenogenetic,</b> producing unfertilised eggs, {{and at least one}} species is viviparous. Gastrotrichs mature with great rapidity and have lifespans of only a few days.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes show a {{diversity}} of mating styles and structures. In the basal order Polyxenida (bristle millipedes), mating is indirect: males deposit spermatophores onto webs they secrete with special glands, and the spermatophores are subsequently picked up by females. In all other millipede groups, males possess one or two pairs of modified legs called gonopods which are used to transfer sperm to the female during copulation. The location of the gonopods differs between groups: in males of the Pentazonia they are located {{at the rear of}} the body and known as telopods and may also function in grasping females, while in the Helminthomorpha – the vast majority of species – they are located on the seventh body segment. A few species are <b>parthenogenetic,</b> having few, if any, males.|$|E
5|$|A louse's color {{varies from}} pale beige to dark gray; however, if feeding on blood, {{it may become}} {{considerably}} darker. Female lice are usually more common than males, and some species are <b>parthenogenetic,</b> with young developing from unfertilized eggs. A louse's egg is commonly called a nit. Many lice attach their eggs to their hosts' hair with specialized saliva; the saliva/hair bond {{is very difficult to}} sever without specialized products. Lice inhabiting birds, however, may simply leave their eggs in parts of the body inaccessible to preening, such as the interior of feather shafts. Living louse eggs tend to be pale whitish, whereas dead louse eggs are yellower. Lice are exopterygotes, being born as miniature versions of the adult, known as nymphs. The young moult three times before reaching the final adult form, usually within a month after hatching.|$|E
5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid has both sexual and asexual generations in its life cycle. It also {{alternates}} hosts {{at different times}} of year. The primary host plants are woody shrubs, and eggs are laid on these by winged females in the autumn. The adults then die and the eggs overwinter. The aphids that hatch from these eggs in the spring are wingless females known as stem mothers. These are able to reproduce asexually, giving birth to live offspring, nymphs, through parthenogenesis. The lifespan of a <b>parthenogenetic</b> female is about 50 days and during this period, each can produce as many as 30 young. The offspring are also females and able to reproduce without mating, but further generations are usually winged forms. These migrate to their secondary host plants, completely different species that are typically herbaceous plants with soft, young growth.|$|E
25|$|At {{least two}} species of spiders in the family Oonopidae (goblin spiders), Heteroonops spinimanus and Triaeris stenaspis, {{are thought to be}} <b>parthenogenetic,</b> as no males have ever been collected. <b>Parthenogenetic</b> {{reproduction}} has been demonstrated in the laboratory for T.stenaspis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Parthenogenetic</b> {{species are}} {{suspected}} to occur among chameleons, agamids, xantusiids, and typhlopids.|$|E
25|$|Automixis is a {{term that}} covers several {{reproductive}} mechanisms, {{some of which are}} <b>parthenogenetic.</b>|$|E
25|$|Brief {{strontium}} chloride exposure induces <b>parthenogenetic</b> {{activation of}} oocytes {{which is used}} in developmental biological research.|$|E
25|$|This {{can result}} in <b>parthenogenetic</b> {{offspring}} being unique {{from each other and}} from their mother.|$|E
25|$|At {{least two}} {{species in the}} genus Dugesia, flatworms in the Turbellaria {{sub-division}} of the phylum Platyhelminthes, include polyploid individuals that reproduce by parthenogenesis. This type of parthenogenesis requires mating, but the sperm does {{not contribute to the}} genetics of the offspring (the parthenogenesis is pseudogamous, alternatively referred to as gynogenetic). A complex cycle of matings between diploid sexual and polyploid <b>parthenogenetic</b> individuals produces new <b>parthenogenetic</b> lines.|$|E
25|$|There are {{no known}} cases of {{naturally}} occurring mammalian parthenogenesis in the wild. <b>Parthenogenetic</b> progeny of mammals would have two X chromosomes, and would therefore be female.|$|E
25|$|Parthenogenesis {{has been}} studied {{extensively}} in the New Mexico whiptail in the genus Cnemidophorus (also known as Aspidoscelis) of which 15 species reproduce exclusively by parthenogenesis. These lizards live in the dry and sometimes harsh climate of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. All these asexual species appear to have arisen through the hybridization {{of two or three}} of the sexual species in the genus leading to polyploid individuals. The mechanism by which the mixing of chromosomes from two or three species can lead to <b>parthenogenetic</b> reproduction is unknown. Recently, a hybrid <b>parthenogenetic</b> whiptail lizard was bred in the laboratory from a cross between an asexual and a sexual whiptail. Because multiple hybridization events can occur, individual <b>parthenogenetic</b> whiptail species can consist of multiple independent asexual lineages. Within lineages, there is very little genetic diversity, but different lineages may have quite different genotypes.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, {{recurring}} shark parthenogenesis {{over several}} years was demonstrated in a captive zebra shark, a type of carpet shark. DNA genotyping demonstrated that individual zebra sharks can switch from sexual to <b>parthenogenetic</b> reproduction.|$|E
25|$|Some {{invertebrate}} {{species that}} feature (partial) sexual reproduction {{in their native}} range are found to reproduce solely by parthenogenesis in areas {{to which they have}} been introduced. Relying solely on <b>parthenogenetic</b> reproduction has several advantages for an invasive species: it obviates the need for individuals in a very sparse initial population to search for mates, and an exclusively female sex distribution allows a population to multiply and invade more rapidly, potentially up to twice as fast. Examples include several aphid species and the willow sawfly, Nematus oligospilus, which is sexual in its native Holarctic habitat but <b>parthenogenetic</b> where it has been introduced into the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|Several {{species of}} <b>parthenogenetic</b> {{gastropods}} have been studied, especially {{with respect to}} their status as invasive species. Such species include the New Zealand mud snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum), the red-rimmed melania (Melanoides tuberculata), and the Quilted melania (Tarebia granifera).|$|E
25|$|Some aphids have {{telescoping}} generations, that is, the <b>parthenogenetic,</b> viviparous female has {{a daughter}} within her, who is already parthenogenetically producing her own daughter. Thus, a female's diet can affect the body size and birth {{rate of more than}} two generations (daughters and granddaughters).|$|E
25|$|However, Hanley et al. studied mite infestations of a <b>parthenogenetic</b> gecko {{species and}} its two related sexual ancestral species. Contrary to {{expectation}} {{based on the}} Red Queen hypothesis, {{they found that the}} prevalence, abundance and mean intensity of mites in sexual geckos was significantly higher than in asexuals sharing the same habitat.|$|E
25|$|<b>Parthenogenetic</b> {{offspring}} {{in species}} that use either the XY or the X0 sex-determination system have two X chromosomes and are female. In species {{that use the}} ZW sex-determination system, they have either two Z chromosomes (male) or two W chromosomes (mostly non-viable but rarely a female), or they could have one Z and one W chromosome (female).|$|E
25|$|Parthenogenesis {{in birds}} is known mainly {{from studies of}} domesticated turkeys and chickens, {{although}} {{it has also been}} noted in the domestic pigeon. In most cases the egg fails to develop normally or completely to hatching. The first description of <b>parthenogenetic</b> development in a passerine was demonstrated in captive zebra finches, although the dividing cells exhibited irregular nuclei and the eggs did not hatch.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, facultative {{parthenogenesis}} {{was reported}} in wild vertebrates {{for the first time}} by US researchers amongst captured pregnant copperhead and cottonmouth female pit-vipers. The Komodo dragon, which normally reproduces sexually, has also been found able to reproduce asexually by parthenogenesis. A case has been documented of a Komodo dragon reproducing via sexual reproduction after a known <b>parthenogenetic</b> event, highlighting that these cases of parthenogenesis are reproductive accidents, rather than adaptive, facultative parthenogenesis.|$|E
25|$|Anecdotal {{reports and}} {{observations}} {{suggest that in}} KwaZulu-Natal the indigenous thiarid Melanoides tuberculata is becoming less common and pressure from the spread of Tarebia granifera, particularly at high densities, is a possible explanation. Like Tarebia granifera, Melanoides tuberculata is <b>parthenogenetic</b> and ovoviviparous, grows to a similar size, are similar in size at first birth and juvenile output. Data from several habitats where the species occur sympatrically show however that in all such situations Tarebia granifera becomes numerically dominant.|$|E
25|$|Centipede {{reproduction}} {{does not}} involve copulation. Males deposit a spermatophore for the female to take up. In one clade, this spermatophore is deposited in a web, and the male undertakes a courtship dance to encourage the female to engulf his sperm. In other cases, the males just leave them for the females to find. In temperate areas, egg laying occurs in spring and summer, but in subtropical and tropical areas, little seasonality to centipede breeding is apparent. A few species of <b>parthenogenetic</b> centipedes are known.|$|E
25|$|When a {{sophisticated}} reproductive strategy is used, only females {{are present in}} the population {{at the beginning of the}} seasonal cycle (although a few species of aphids have been found to have both male and female sexes). The overwintering eggs that hatch in the spring result in females, called fundatrices. Reproduction is typically <b>parthenogenetic</b> and viviparous. Eggs are parthenogenetically produced without meiosis and the offspring are clonal to their mother. The embryos develop within the mothers' ovarioles, which then give live birth to first-instar female nymphs (viviparous). The offspring resemble their parents in every way except size, and are called virginoparae.|$|E
25|$|When meiosis is involved, {{the sex of}} the {{offspring}} will depend on the type of sex determination system and the type of apomixis. In species that use the XY sex-determination system, <b>parthenogenetic</b> offspring will have two X chromosomes and are female. In species that use the ZW sex-determination system {{the offspring}} genotype may be one of ZW (female), ZZ (male), or WW (non-viable in most species but a fertile, viable female in a few (e.g., boas)). ZW offspring are produced by endoreplication before meiosis or by central fusion. ZZ and WW offspring occur either by terminal fusion or by endomitosis in the egg cell.|$|E
25|$|Tarebia granifera is both <b>parthenogenetic</b> and ovoviviparous, {{although}} {{males have}} been reported. These are characteristics which are undoubtedly key to its success as an invader. For example no males {{have been found}} amongst hundreds dissected from KwaZulu-Natal, {{it is probable that}} a few are present. Males were found in most (6/7) populations examined in Puerto Rico but were generally uncommon at up to 22.7% of the population (mean 4.6%). Live sperm were present in the testes of these males but the genitalia were apparently non-functional. R. Tucker Abbott (1952) failed to find sperm in the gonads of male Tarebia granifera from Florida. Most Tarebia granifera are therefore clones of the female parent.|$|E
25|$|Oak marble galls {{develop as}} a {{chemically}} induced distortion of leaf buds on pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), sessile oak (Quercus petraea) or their hybrid Quercus × rosacea, trees, {{caused by the}} <b>parthenogenetic</b> gall wasp (Andricus kollari, (Hartig, 1843)) which lays eggs within leaf buds using their ovipositor. The Turkey oak (Quercus cerris), introduced into Britain in 1735, {{is required for the}} completion of the life cycle of the gall. The oak marble gall is frequently confused with the oak apple gall, caused by another gall wasp, Biorhiza pallida. Oak marble galls are also known as the bullet gall, oak nut or Devonshire gall. Synonyms for the species are Cynips kollari, Andricus quercusgemmae, A. minor, A. indigenus and A. circulans.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} occurs {{through the}} clustered or scattered deposition of spermatophores by male adults. Stimulation of spermatophore deposition by female pheromones {{has been demonstrated}} in Sinella curviseta. Mating behaviour {{can be observed in}} Symphypleona. Among Symphypleona, males of some Sminthuridae use a clasping organ located on their antenna. Many collembolan species, mostly those living in deeper soil horizons, are <b>parthenogenetic,</b> which favours reproduction to the detriment of genetic diversity and thereby to population tolerance of environmental hazards. Parthenogenesis (also called thelytoky) is under the control of symbiotic bacteria of the genus Wolbachia, which live, reproduce and are carried in female reproductive organs and eggs of Collembola. Feminizing Wolbachia species are widespread in arthropods and nematodes, where they co-evolved with most of their lineages.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time as the {{generation}} of the gynogenetic and androgenetic embryos discussed above, mouse embryos were also being generated that contained only small regions that were derived from either a paternal or maternal source. The generation of a series of such uniparental disomies, which together span the entire genome, allowed the creation of an imprinting map. Those regions which when inherited from a single parent result in a discernible phenotype contain imprinted gene(s). Further research showed that within these regions there were often numerous imprinted genes. Around 80% of imprinted genes are found in clusters such as these, called imprinted domains, suggesting a level of co-ordinated control. More recently, genome-wide screens to identify imprinted genes have used differential expression of mRNAs from control fetuses and <b>parthenogenetic</b> or androgenetic fetuses hybridized to expression arrays, allele-specific gene expression using SNP genotyping arrays, transcriptome sequencing, and in silico prediction pipelines.|$|E
25|$|Separating {{the effect}} of {{resource}} use from that of interference is not easy. A good example of exploitative competition is found in aphid species competing over the sap in plant phloem. Each aphid species that feeds on host plant sap uses some of the resource, leaving less for competing species. In one study, Fordinae geoica was observed to out-compete F. formicaria {{to the extent that}} the latter species exhibited a reduction in survival by 84%. Another example is the one of competition for calling space in amphibians, where the calling activity of a species prevents the other one from calling in an area as wide as it would in allopatry. A last example is driving of bisexual rock lizards of genus Darevskia from their natural habitats by a daughter unisexual form; interference competition can be ruled out in this case, because <b>parthenogenetic</b> forms of the lizards never demonstrate aggressive behavior.|$|E
25|$|On August 2, 2007, {{after much}} {{independent}} investigation, {{it was revealed}} that discredited South Korean scientist Hwang Woo-Suk unknowingly produced the first human embryos resulting from parthenogenesis. Initially, Hwang claimed he and his team had extracted stem cells from cloned human embryos, a result later found to be fabricated. Further examination of the chromosomes of these cells show indicators of parthenogenesis in those extracted stem cells, similar to those found in the mice created by Tokyo scientists in 2004. Although Hwang deceived the world about being the first to create artificially cloned human embryos, he did contribute a major breakthrough to stem cell research by creating human embryos using parthenogenesis. The truth was discovered in 2007, long after the embryos were created by him and his team in February 2004. This made Hwang the first, unknowingly, to successfully perform the process of parthenogenesis to create a human embryon and, ultimately, a human <b>parthenogenetic</b> stem cell line.|$|E
25|$|Parthenogenesis is seen {{to occur}} {{naturally}} in aphids, Daphnia, rotifers, nematodes and some other invertebrates, {{as well as in}} many plants. Among vertebrates, strict parthenogenesis is only known to occur in lizards, snakes, birds and sharks, with fish, amphibians and reptiles exhibiting various forms of gynogenesis and hybridogenesis (an incomplete form of parthenogenesis). The first all-female (unisexual) reproduction in vertebrates was described in the fish Poecilia formosa in 1932. Since then at least 50 species of unisexual vertebrate have been described, including at least 20 fish, 25 lizards, a single snake species, frogs, and salamanders. Other, usually sexual, species may occasionally reproduce parthenogenetically and Komodo dragons; the hammerhead and blacktip sharks are recent additions to the known list of spontaneous <b>parthenogenetic</b> vertebrates. As with all types of asexual reproduction, there are both costs (low genetic diversity and therefore susceptibility to adverse mutations that might occur) and benefits (reproduction without the need for a male) associated with parthenogenesis.|$|E
25|$|On June 26, 2007, International Stem Cell Corporation (ISCC), a California-based {{stem cell}} {{research}} company, announced that their lead scientist, Dr. Elena Revazova, and her research team {{were the first to}} intentionally create human stem cells from unfertilized human eggs using parthenogenesis. The process may offer a way for creating stem cells that are genetically matched to a particular female for the treatment of degenerative diseases that might affect her. In December 2007, Dr. Revazova and ISCC published an article illustrating a breakthrough in the use of parthenogenesis to produce human stem cells that are homozygous in the HLA region of DNA. These stem cells are called HLA homozygous <b>parthenogenetic</b> human stem cells (hpSC-Hhom) and have unique characteristics that would allow derivatives of these cells to be implanted into millions of people without immune rejection. With proper selection of oocyte donors according to HLA haplotype, it is possible to generate a bank of cell lines whose tissue derivatives, collectively, could be MHC-matched with a significant number of individuals within the human population.|$|E
