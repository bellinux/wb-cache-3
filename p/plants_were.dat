50|$|Male {{and female}} flowers of the hop plant usually develop on {{separate}} <b>plants</b> (that <b>is,</b> the <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> dioecious), although fertile monoecious individuals appear occasionally. Because viable seeds are undesirable for brewing beer, only female <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> grown in hop fields, thus preventing pollination. Female <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> propagated vegetatively, and male <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> culled if <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> grown from seeds.|$|R

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} Cereal Crops Research Institute Pirsabak Nowshera during 2002 - 03 on six wheat cultivars/advance lines to identify the best suitable time of planting in the central agro-ecological zone of NWFP. Randomized complete block design was used with 3 replications. Six <b>planting</b> dates <b>were</b> used from October 25 th to December 15 th with 10 days increment. Data were recorded on Days to 50 % heading, Days to maturity, Plant height and Grain yield. Maximum number of days (132) to 50 % heading <b>were</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on October 25 th Minimum number of days (114) <b>were</b> reported when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on December, 15 th. Maximum number of days (178) to maturity <b>were</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on October 25 th. Number of days to maturity decreased as <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> delayed with 10 days increment. Minimum number of days (130) <b>were</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> delayed till 15 th of December. Highest plant height (98 cm) <b>was</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on October 25 th and November 05 th. Plant Height decreased as <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> delayed. Minimum <b>Plant</b> height (85 cm) <b>was</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> delayed till 15 th of December. Maximum grain yield (3937 kg ha - 1) <b>was</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on November 05 th. Grain yield decreased as <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> delayed with 10 days increment. Minimum grain yield (2274 kg ha - 1) <b>was</b> observed when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on 15 th of December. A negative correlation <b>was</b> recorded between <b>planting</b> dates and days to 50 % heading, days to maturity, Plant height and Grain yield. The yield losses due to late <b>planting</b> recorded <b>were</b> 8 % when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on November 15 th, 22 % loss when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on 25 th November, 34 % losses <b>were</b> incurred when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on December 5 th and 42 % losses <b>were</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> further delayed till December 15 th. Hence it is concluded that {{first two weeks of}} November is the best time for obtaining higher yields from the recommended cultivars...|$|R

5|$|Cacti were {{cultivated}} as ornamental {{plants from}} the time they were first brought from the New World. By the early 1800s, enthusiasts in Europe had large collections (often including other succulents alongside cacti). Rare <b>plants</b> <b>were</b> sold for very high prices. Suppliers of cacti and other succulents employed collectors to obtain plants from the wild, in addition to growing their own. In the late 1800s, collectors turned to orchids, and cacti became less popular, although never disappearing from cultivation.|$|E

5|$|Darwin's speculations on {{the origin}} of species {{convinced}} him that cross-fertilisation {{played an important role in}} keeping specific forms consistent. He rejected the doctrine that the characteristics of a species were static, and was aware from animal husbandry that inbreeding could lead to changes, often deleterious. He thought that natural outbreeding through cross-fertilisation would keep wild species homogenous yet vigorous. Cross-fertilisation would confer an evolutionary advantage by spreading favourable changes throughout a reproductive community. His ideas were contrary to the common supposition that <b>plants</b> <b>were</b> usually self-fertilising, and so every summer Darwin investigated the contribution of insect pollination to the cross-pollination of flowers.|$|E
