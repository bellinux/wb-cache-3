5|$|Promotion: A {{communication}} with the market should put stress on environmental aspects, for example that the company possesses a CP certificate or is ISO 14000 certified. This may be publicized to improve a firm’s image. Furthermore, {{the fact that a}} company spends expenditures on environmental protection should be advertised. Third, sponsoring the natural environment is also very important. And last but not least, ecological <b>products</b> <b>will</b> probably require special sales promotions.|$|E

The pretransfer conference covers issues such as what <b>products</b> <b>will</b> be moved, the order of movement, names and titles of key people, particulars of shipboard and shore equipment, critical states of the transfer, regulations in effect, emergency and spill-containment procedures, watch and shift arrangements, and shutdown procedures.|$|E

It begins with the definition and some basic properties of the Kronecker <b>product.</b> Statements <b>will</b> be proven that reveal information concerning the eigenvalues, singular values, rank, trace, and determinant of the Kronecker product of two matrices. The Kronecker <b>product</b> <b>will</b> then be employed to solve linear matrix equations. An investigation of the commutativity of the Kronecker <b>product</b> <b>will</b> be carried out using permutation matrices. The Jordan - Canonical form of a Kronecker <b>product</b> <b>will</b> be examined. Variations such as the Kronecker sum and generalized Kronecker <b>product</b> <b>will</b> be introduced.

5|$|Flying foxes {{often come}} to the {{attention}} of Australian wildlife care and rescue organisations, such as Wildcare Australia, ONARR, Wildlife Carers Darling Downs, Bat Care, Bat Rescue, Tweed Valley Wildlife Carers, WIRES, and Wildlife Victoria when reported as injured, sick, orphaned, or abandoned. A very high proportion of adult flying fox injuries are caused by entanglement in barbed wire fences or backyard fruit tree netting, both of which can result in very serious injuries and a slow, agonising death for the animal if not rescued quickly. More recently wildlife advocacy groups such the Victorian Advocates for Animals has used the commercial development of a range of wildlife safe fruit tree netting products to push for regulations to make it illegal to install wildlife unsafe nets on backyard fruit trees. These new products have as their chief characteristic small apertures / holes of 5mm x 5mm or less. Flying foxes are able to climb across the netting without being entangled. It is hoped the uptake of wildlife safe netting <b>products</b> <b>will</b> see a marked decline in flying fox entanglements across time and subsequent reduction in public risk and the burden on wildlife rescue and rehabilitation volunteers.|$|E

25|$|These polar stratospheric clouds (PSC) form during winter, in {{the extreme}} cold. Polar winters are dark, {{consisting}} of 3 months without solar radiation (sunlight). The lack of sunlight contributes to a decrease in temperature and the polar vortex traps and chills air. Temperatures hover around or below −80°C. These low temperatures form cloud particles. There are three types of PSC clouds—nitric acid trihydrate clouds, slowly cooling water-ice clouds, and rapid cooling water-ice (nacerous) clouds—provide surfaces for chemical reactions whose <b>products</b> <b>will,</b> in the spring lead to ozone destruction.|$|E
