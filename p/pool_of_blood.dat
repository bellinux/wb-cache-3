5|$|By {{the time}} Detective Chief Superintendent Roy Ranson arrived at Lower Belgrave Street early on Friday 8November, the divisional surgeon had {{pronounced}} Sandra Rivett dead and forensic officers and photographers {{had been called}} to the property. Other than the front door, which the first two officers on the scene had kicked in, {{there was no sign}} of a forced entry. A bloodstained towel was found in Veronica's first-floor bedroom. The area around the top of the basement staircase was heavily bloodstained. A bloodstained lead pipe lay on the floor. Pictures hanging from the staircase walls were askew and a metal banister rail was damaged. At the foot of the stairs, two cups and saucers lay in a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b> Rivett's arm protruded from the canvas sack, which lay in a slowly expanding <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b> The light fitting at the bottom of the stairs was missing its bulb; one was noted nearby, on a chair. Blood was also found on various leaves in the adjoining rear garden.|$|E
5|$|Spencer begins {{experiencing}} visions, again {{seeing the}} Man in the Planet, {{as well as}} the Lady in the Radiator (Laurel Near), who sings to him as she stomps upon spermatozoon-like creatures. After a sexual encounter with the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall, Spencer has a vision where he is decapitated by a creature resembling the child, revealing a stump underneath that resembles the child's face. Soon afterwards, Spencer's head sinks into a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> and falls from the sky, landing on a street below. A boy finds it, bringing it to a pencil factory to be turned into erasers.|$|E
5|$|Williamson's {{body was}} {{discovered}} by Chambers at approximately 11.15am. Chambers noticed that the air conditioning had been left on, something that Williamson was unlikely to have done, and then realised that Williamson's bedroom door had been left ajar. Investigating further, {{he opened the door}} and discovered Williamson's corpse lying face down on the floor, with multiple stab wounds to the neck and surrounded by a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b> Williamson's dog, Tessa, was running about in the room and barking.|$|E

5|$|Later, Suzuha Amane, Daru's future daughter, {{arrives in}} a time machine to tell Okabe {{that the only way}} to prevent a time-travel arms race leading to World War III is to prevent Kurisu's father Nakabachi from killing her and {{stealing}} her time travel theories. Suzuha and Okabe travel back in time, but Okabe accidentally kills Kurisu himself. Returning to the present, Okabe receives a message from his future self telling him that to escape the current timeline, he needs to save Kurisu while recreating the vision of the dead Kurisu that his past self saw. Traveling back in time again, he provokes Nakabachi into stabbing him, knocks Kurisu unconscious, and puts her in his <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> for his past self to see, causing the timeline to diverge into one where Kurisu lives and World War III does not occur.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{plan was}} to create setpiece {{graphics}} for key story moments, similar to simulation titles on PC games. Among the scenes initially planned were Marth kneeling next to the character Jagen in a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood,</b> and two characters escaping from an ambush. To try and accommodate the advanced graphics, the team opted to use an MMC3 memory chip. The adoption of the MMC3 was influenced by memory space difficulties experienced by the team during the development of Famicom Wars. When {{it was discovered that}} the chip only had one megabite of memory, the team were forced to streamline the graphics and visuals, resulting in the setpiece graphics being cut. The reduced emphasis on graphics meant that the game was not visually impressive, which was later regretted by Kaga and other team members.|$|E
5|$|On Sunday 30 September, {{the body}} of prostitute Elizabeth Stride was {{discovered}} at about 1am in Dutfield's Yard, inside the gateway of 40 Berner Street (since renamed Henriques Street), Whitechapel. She was lying in a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> with her throat cut from left to right. She had been killed just minutes before, and her body was otherwise unmutilated. It {{is possible that the}} murderer was disturbed before he could commit any mutilation of the body by someone entering the yard, perhaps Louis Diemschutz, who discovered the body. However, some commentators on the case conclude that Stride's murder was unconnected to the others on the basis that the body was unmutilated, that it was the only murder to occur south of Whitechapel Road, and that the blade used might have been shorter and of a different design. Most experts, however, consider the similarities in the case distinctive enough to connect Stride's murder with {{at least two of the}} earlier ones, as well as that of Catherine Eddowes on the same night.|$|E

25|$|She {{was not in}} fact dead, {{and when}} Lucas's {{half-sister}} Opal (with whom he was staying) returned later, she discovered their mother alive in a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b> She called an ambulance, {{but it turned out}} to be too late to save Viola Lucas' life. The official police report stated she died of a heart attack precipitated by the assault. Lucas returned to Virginia, then says he decided to drive back to Michigan, but was arrested in Ohio on the outstanding Michigan warrant.|$|E
25|$|For the raid, police wore masks {{to hinder}} identification. Most {{occupants}} of the building were in their sleeping bags, and many raised their arms in surrender when they realised the police were breaking into the building. However, police attacked the crowds with truncheons, beating everyone indiscriminately. A 65-year-old woman's arm was broken. Melanie Jonasch, a 28-year-old archaeology student from Berlin, was attacked by officers set upon her, beating her head so hard that she rapidly lost consciousness. When she fell to the ground, officers circled her, beating and kicking her limp body, banging her head against a nearby cupboard, leaving her in a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b>|$|E

25|$|At daybreak police {{reinforcements}} {{arrived from}} Benalla, Beechworth, and Wangaratta. Superintendent John Sadleir came from Benalla with nine more men. Sergeant Steele, of Wangaratta, brought six, {{for a total}} of about 30 men. Before daylight Senior-Constable Kelly found a revolving rifle and a silk cap lying in the bush, about 100 yards from the hotel. The rifle was covered with blood and a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> lay near it. They believed it to belong to one of the bushrangers, hinting that they had escaped. They proved to be those of Ned Kelly himself. At daybreak the women and children among the hostages were allowed to depart. They were challenged as they approached the police line, to ensure that the outlaws were not attempting to escape in disguise.|$|E
25|$|On December 14, 1999, Corinne Caillaux, 36, {{was stabbed}} {{to death in the}} {{lavatory}} of a Calais to Ventimiglia overnight train while her infant son slept in a carriage. Guards found her slumped in a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> in a train toilet. She had been stabbed at least 13 times while her 6-year-old son lay sleeping, and died later from her injuries. The inspectors found a blood-soaked baseball hat close to her body. Rezala was wearing a similar cap when he was found travelling without a ticket about two hours earlier, on the journey from Calais to Ventimiglia on the Italian frontier. DNA tests are being conducted on hairs found in the hat. Police have records of Rezala's DNA taken after earlier crimes.|$|E

According to sources, this would place the murder event sometime between 2 and 5 in the morning. Each victim died of multiple stabbing wounds, and sources said Sarowar's limbs were tied and he had the most stab wounds.

Nick ran to confront Matt at his apartment, only to {{discover}} Matt lying in a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> having been shot. Nick's DNA {{was found on the}} gun and he was arrested. Victor hired Paul Williams (Doug Davidson) and a range of attorneys to free Nick, who had to go to trial for attempted murder. Nick was found guilty and sent to jail, where he spent Christmas of 1995. However, in February 1996 he was acquitted when Amy came forward as the actual shooter after Matt tried to rape her. Amy was in seclusion after recovering from mental trauma. Matt skipped town after he became in trouble for lying in court, claiming he remembered Nick shooting him. Nick and Sharon then married.|$|E
25|$|The {{day of the}} murder, an {{eyewitness}} came forward and told investigators that she allegedly saw {{the two young men}} involved in BermÃºdez ZacarÃ­as' murder. She said that the two men were of slim complexion and may have been 24â€“25 years old; according to her description, one was fully dressed in black and that the other had dark pants and a white sweater. The woman saw them as she was driving through the street where BermÃºdez ZacarÃ­as was murdered. When she first saw the two men, she did not think they were suspicious because she thought they were construction workers from a nearby site. As she was driving down the street, she saw BermÃºdez ZacarÃ­as on the road and thought that he had fainted. When she got close to the body, she noticed a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b> She turned back to look at the two men, who kept walking down the street in an opposite direction.|$|E

It was wonderfully little, considering the amount of ammunition and energy expended. In the first pit one man was found dead; a bullet had entered his forehead and come out {{at the back of}} his head. Moving him a little on one side they found another man under him, shot in the same way. All round the pit inside were large <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood,</b> but no bodies, for the natives invariably dragged or carried away their dead when that was possible. In the other two pits large <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> were also found, but no bodies. Beyond them, however, one man was discovered shot through the heart. He had evidently been dragged along the sand, but the tremendous fire of the defenders had compelled the enemy to drop him. Still further on they found twelve more corpses which had been dragged a short way and then left.|$|R
