50|$|In many cities, {{building}} setbacks {{add value}} to the interior real estate adjacent to the setback by creating usable exterior spaces. These setback terraces are prized for the access they provide to fresh air, skyline views, and recreational uses such as gardening and outdoor dining. In addition, setbacks promote fire safety by spacing buildings and their <b>protruding</b> <b>parts</b> {{away from each other}} and allow for passage of firefighting apparatus between buildings.|$|E
50|$|Loading bridges {{may pose}} hazards to {{aircraft}} if handled improperly. If {{the bridge is}} not retracted fully before departure, it may contact <b>protruding</b> <b>parts</b> of the taxiing aircraft (e.g., a pitot tube), requiring repair and delays. Furthermore, during cold weather, the loading bridge may become frozen to the aircraft. In this case, when the jet bridge retracts, it could damage the aircraft if that area has not been properly de-iced.|$|E
50|$|To achieve {{electropolishing}} of a rough surface, the <b>protruding</b> <b>parts</b> of {{a surface}} profile must dissolve {{faster than the}} recesses. This process, referred to as anodic levelling, can be subject to incorrect analysis when measuring the surface topography. Anodic dissolution under electropolishing conditions deburrs metal objects due to increased current density on corners and burrs.Most importantly, successful electropolishing should operate under diffusion limited constant current plateau, achieved by following current dependence on voltage (polarisation curve), under constant temperature and stirring conditions.|$|E

50|$|A {{structure}} relocation is {{the process}} of moving a structure from one location to another. There are two main ways for a structure to be moved: disassembling and then reassembling it at the required destination, or transporting it whole. For the latter, the building is first raised and then may be pushed on temporary rails or dollies if the distance is short. Otherwise, wheels, such as flatbed trucks, are used. These moves can be complicated and require the removal of <b>protruding</b> <b>parts</b> of the building, such as the chimney, as well as obstacles along the journey, such as overhead cables and trees.|$|E

30|$|The {{surface of}} HA-coated wires had round pours that were {{positioned}} {{on the entire}} surface of the coating and HA “waves.” The shape and location of such “waves” differed between the HA-coated SSW and HA-coated TW (Fig.  2 c, d). Concentric spindles were formed round the pours {{on the surface of}} SSWs that united into a conglomeration, while the HA spindles on the TW surface were not linked to the pours but formed a trabecular-like picture where the crests of more <b>protruded</b> <b>parts</b> were interchanging with the pours and less <b>protruded</b> <b>parts</b> of HA coating. Globular structures that had a diameter from one to 4  µm were diffusely positioned on the coating of TWs. The pours of HA-coated wires also differed. HA-coated SSWs had pours that were from one to 4  µm in diameter with the distance of two to 7  µm between them. The pour openings on the TW coating were more variable with the diameter from one to 25  µm. The distance between them was not uniform and measured from two to 25  µm.|$|R

50|$|Telescopic {{friction}} stays are tube {{shaped and}} can extend from 11 to 16 inches. They have models for outward opening or inward opening windows. These were invented by Alfred M Lane for the Monarch Metal Weather Strip Company later called Monarch Metal Products Company in St. Louis, Missouri. The tubes maintained their position by friction blocks that applied {{pressure to the}} outer tube. The tubes {{had the advantage of}} keeping out dirt and water, and having no <b>protruding</b> <b>parts</b> that could harm people. This became known as the Monarch casement stay and cost USD1.50 in 1925.|$|E
5000|$|The {{shell size}} of Ranella olearium varies between 90 mm and 240 mm. [...] It {{is a highly}} {{variable}} species. Usually these large shells are elongated, thick and sturdy, with rounded whorls and with tubercles more or less developed on some sutures. The mouth is large and has a rounded section. The siphonal channel is moderately long and the lip bears many teeth, often double, arranged along the polished, white or brown edge. The external surface of the shell is brown ocher, with clearer tubercles and other <b>protruding</b> <b>parts.</b> The inner surface and the columella are white. In the living individual the shell is commonly covered with an outer velvety layer.|$|E
50|$|The {{shells of}} cone snails vary in size. The shells are shaped {{more or less}} like the {{geometric}} shape known as a cone, {{as one might expect}} from the popular and scientific name. The shell is many-whorled and {{in the form of an}} inverted cone, the anterior end being the narrow end. The <b>protruding</b> <b>parts</b> of the top of the whorls that form the spire are more or less in the shape of another, much more flattened, cone. The aperture is elongated and narrow. The horny operculum is very small. The outer lip is simple, thin, and sharp, is without a callus, and has a notched tip at the upper part. The columella is straight.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Aorto-ostial stenting {{remains one}} of the most {{demanding}} and risky types of angioplasty to perform. We report a case outlining a creative solution for the reengagement of a protruding aorto-ostial stent. Case presentation A 69 -year-old Caucasian man was admitted to our hospital's coronary care unit with progressive unstable angina five years following coronary artery bypass grafting and three years after percutaneous coronary intervention of the graft. Several attempts to engage the <b>protruding</b> <b>part</b> of the aorto-ostial stent in the graft failed. A catheter was eventually floated towards the <b>protruding</b> <b>part</b> using a wire to moor the catheter to the stent through the side-strut. The proximal <b>part</b> of the <b>protruding</b> stent was subsequently crushed with a new stent. Stent patency was observed 12 months after the procedure was performed. Conclusion Although careful cannulation of a aorto-ostial stent during repeat coronary angiography coupled with the placement of a guidewire and stent through the true stent lumen during repeat intervention remains the ideal approach for aorto-ostial in-stent restenosis, this case report confirms the feasibility of the side-strut stenting technique in reaching a long-term positive outcome. </p...|$|R

50|$|The Matochina Fortress (Маточинска крепост, Matochinska krepost), {{also known}} as Bukelon (Букелон), lies on a plateau to the {{northeast}} of the village itself. Bukelon was reportedly mentioned in reports about the Battle of Adrianople of 378. The only well-preserved part of the castle today is the inner fortress with the keep, which is 18 m in height and dates to the 12th-14th century. The keep is a three-storey tower with arrow loops on all sides. The third storey was reportedly used as a chapel for the defenders. The keep was constructed out of stone and bricks. A cross-shaped brick monogram {{to the side of}} the entrance indicates that the fortress may have been reconstructed by Tsar Michael Shishman of Bulgaria (1323-1330). The keep is rectangular in shape with two <b>protruding</b> <b>parts,</b> one of which is semicylindrical. The Matochina Fortress was part of Adrianople's defensive system and protected the city from the north.|$|E
50|$|The {{teeth of}} Guidraco are very distinctive. Of the twenty-three {{teeth of the}} upper jaw the first is long and very narrow, {{pointing}} nearly horizontally forward. The next three teeth are enormous in size, very long, robust, pointed and slightly recurved. They gradually point more downwards. These are followed {{by a series of}} three medium-length downward-pointing straight teeth, of which the middle one, the sixth, is the shortest. The remaining thirteen teeth constitute a long row of small elements gradually diminishing in size. This arrangement is mirrored by the eighteen teeth of the lower jaw. Here however, a forward pointing tooth is lacking. The first four teeth are of great size, even longer than their counterparts of the upper jaw. Next is a series of three straight teeth of medium height, followed by a row of eleven increasingly smaller elements for a grand total in the head of eighty-two teeth. With the fossil, the beak is closed and due to their extreme length the front teeth extend far beyond the upper and lower edges of the head, the <b>protruding</b> <b>parts</b> being up to twice as long as the depth of the snout or lower jaw. The teeth can also be divided into two types according to their built: the first nine teeth of the upper jaw and eight teeth of the lower jaw have vertical ridges on the back of their enamel; the back teeth have a uniformly smooth enamel and thickened crown bases, giving them a more triangular outline.|$|E
40|$|International audienceOne of {{the main}} {{challenges}} in shape matching is overcoming intra–class variation where objects that are conceptually similar have significant geometric dissimilarity. The key to a solution around this problem is incorporating {{the structure of the}} object in the shape descriptor which can be described by a connectivity graph customarily extracted from its skeleton. In a slightly different perspective, the structure may also be viewed as the arrangement of <b>protruding</b> <b>parts</b> along its boundary. This arrangement does not only convey the protruding part's ordering along the anti clockwise direction, but also relates these parts on different levels of detail. In this paper, we propose a shape matching method that estimates the distance between two objects by conducting a part-to-part matching analysis between their visual <b>protruding</b> <b>parts.</b> We start by a skeleton-based segmentation of the shape inspired by the Chordal Axis Transform. Then, we extract the segments that represent the <b>protruding</b> <b>parts</b> in its silhouette on varied levels of detail. Each one of these parts is described by a feature vector. A shape is thus described by the feature vectors of its parts in addition to their angular and linear proximities to each other. Using dynamic programming, our algorithm finds a minimal cost correspondence between parts. Our experimental evaluations validate the proposition that part correspondence allows conceptual matching of precisely dissimilar shapes...|$|E
50|$|The {{disparities in}} some of the posted distances, notably straightaway center, have not been fully {{reconciled}} by researchers.

The roof of the <b>protruding</b> <b>part</b> of the clubhouse sloped back and met the vertical wall of the larger part of the clubhouse. The exact objects referred to by the numbers 475, 483, and 505 can be speculated but remain unconfirmed.|$|R
5000|$|Rostellum [...] (meaning [...] "small beak", {{from the}} Latin [...] for [...] "beak"; pl. rostella) in helminthology is a <b>protruding</b> <b>part</b> of the {{anterior}} end of soft-bodied tapeworms. It is a retractable, cone-like muscular structure that {{is located on}} the apical end of the scolex, and in most species is armed with hooks, the organs of attachment to the host's intestinal wall. It is a parasitic adaptation in some cestodes for firm attachment in the gastrointestinal tract and is structurally different from one species to another (or even absent is some species), thereby becoming an important diagnostic feature.|$|R
50|$|Also, it is {{possible}} to ascend from the northwest, i.e. straight up from the valley. Hikers then start at the Nerloftet (a low plateau above the Tromsdalen valley), proceed to the half-way stop Loftet (a <b>protruding</b> <b>part</b> of the mountain facing the city), and then go straight up. When the mountain becomes too steep to keep going straight, you go upwards to the right until you're on the 'winter route' (the right slope). The names of these points mean, respectively, the Lower Attic and the Attic. This route is quite steep and thus demanding, but safe - although some rocks may be slippery, or loose, so one should be careful.|$|R
