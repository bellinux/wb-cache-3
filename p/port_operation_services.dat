30|$|In general, {{primarily}} {{the port of}} Piraeus and the other main ports {{of the country are}} disadvantaged compared with other ports in the wider Mediterranean region and Eastern Europe in several points. These are essentially the lack of intermodal transport, particularly the use of containers. In most modern ports in the transport of containers allows the carriage to be combined with road and rail transport, greatly reducing the time and cost of loading and unloading. More specifically, the major disadvantages [3, 21, 22] relate to the failure to connect to the national rail network (combined transport), the poor management and limited cargo containers, the low availability storage containers at ports and in the region, the relatively limited number of positions of ships, the imbalance in the development of modern <b>port</b> <b>operations</b> and <b>services</b> and the absence of an organized policy of attracting new customers (strong dependence on a few activities and a limited group of customers).|$|R
40|$|The organization, {{functions}} and regime of Italian ports have recently deeply modified by {{the enhancement of}} the Law 28. 01. 1999 n. 84. Such bill passed after decades of substantial uncontested State control on harbors, mainly deriving from an anachronistic approach to {{the subject matter of}} State regulations of coastal areas of military and economical importance. The new bill recently enacted by the Italian Parliament sets forth new rules of reclassification of the existing ports. The new law goes further to fix parameters and objectives for the modernization and development of the existing ports and harbor infrastructures. The first attack to the provisions of the new law on ports’ came on the 23 rd October 1995 when the national Steering Committee of Port Operators, on behalf of a private stevedoring company of the port of Brindisi (Brindisi Imbarchi&Sbarchi Srl, hereinafter “BIF”) denounced to the Italian Antitrust Commissions (Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato-“I. A. C. ”), an institution created in Italy with the Law 10 th October 1990 n. 287, some unfair conducts of the Brindisi PSC Stevdoring Company (the local “PSC”).

To assist ports to successfully implant sustainability {{practices in}}to their operations, this paper conceptualized the structure of sustainability practices in international <b>port</b> <b>operations,</b> by clustering the relevant issues, empirically. Using 203 samples collected from port stakeholders in the major ports in Northeast Asia, multi-measurement items were analyzed on exploratory factor analysis in SPSS 21. Results generated a structure that consists of five sub-dimensions conceptualizing sustainability practices {{in the context of}} <b>port</b> <b>operations.</b> As operative practices to accommodate current and future demands in a port, the five-factor model clustering the relevant issues incorporate environmental technologies, process and quality improvement, monitoring and upgrading, communication and cooperation, and active participation. Providing useful insights for strategic agenda to assist ports to incorporate sustainability practices in their operations, the five-factor model offer both a descriptive and diagnostic management tool for future improvement in <b>port</b> <b>operations...</b>|$|R

40|$|Amidst intense port {{competition}} in Northeast Asia, competitiveness in <b>port</b> <b>operations</b> {{is a critical}} issue in adopting and implementing sustainability practice that incorporate economic, environmental, social and operational perspectives. Notwithstanding the importance of sustainability practice for sustainable <b>port</b> <b>operations,</b> very few studies have investigated its links with operational sustainability and competitiveness. For this reason, {{in order to encourage}} the proactive adoption and implementation of sustainability practice in <b>port</b> <b>operations,</b> this study aims to analyse the role of sustainability practice in managing competitiveness and continuous improvements in operational performance, based on mega container <b>ports</b> <b>operations.</b> To address this issue, this study adopted a two-phase research design which incorporates a preliminary field study and empirical research. At first, to understand the specific and general features of sustainability practice in commercial <b>port</b> <b>operations,</b> preliminary field work through semi-structured face-to-face interviews were undertaken. Interviews validated the attributes of sustainability practice in the container port operational context, investigating the relevant issues. Thereafter, based on data collected from 203 organisations engaged in container <b>port</b> <b>operations</b> in Northeast Asia, the feasible relationships among sustainability practice, competitiveness and performance were analysed using hierarchical moderator regression analysis in SPSS 21. Finally, the results revealed that sustainability practice has a significant contribution as a moderator to the relationship between competitiveness, particularly in operational efficiency and service quality, and operational performance. The two-phase research design made it possible to define and validate the role of sustainability practice in managing the relationship between competitiveness and performance. With regard to theory, this study has placed the case of Northeast Asia in a global context. Secondly, the direct relationships between determinants of megaport competitiveness and performance in the context of container <b>port</b> <b>operations</b> were verified. Thirdly, the specific routes, what is achievable and how sustainability practice contributes to enhancing the relationships between determinants of megaport competitiveness and operational performance, were revealed in a container port operational context. For the ports industries, this study has provided useful insights to establish strategies for sustainable <b>port</b> <b>operations</b> and a strategic agenda to assist ports to incorporate sustainability practice, providing evidence that this will contribute to enhancing their overall competitiveness. The findings are expected to be utilised further in future studies on sustainable <b>port</b> development and <b>operations,</b> as well as to provide guidance for port operators in its future improvement strategy...|$|R

40|$|Private <b>operation</b> of <b>port</b> {{facilities}} {{is becoming}} increasingly common worldwide. We investigate the effect of port privatization in a setting with two ports located in different countries, each serving their home market but also competing for the transshipment traffic from a third region. Each government chooses whether to privatize its port or to keep <b>port</b> <b>operations</b> public. We show that there exist equilibria {{in which the two}} governments choose privatization and the national welfare of each port country is higher relative to a situation where ports are public. This is because privatization is a commitment to increase charges relative to public port charges, which allows for a better exploitation of the third region. For some parameter regions, port countries non-cooperatively choose public <b>port</b> <b>operations,</b> while they {{would be better off if}} both ports were private. However, customers of the third region are always better off if <b>port</b> <b>operations</b> are public.
