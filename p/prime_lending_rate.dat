40|$|In this paper, {{the rates}} of return to {{education}} in Singapore are computed by the cost- benefit approach covering the period 1980 - 1994. The results indicate that {{the rates of}} return to education increase with the level of education. Although remaining higher than the rates of return to secondary education, the rates of return for tertiary education are found to be declining during the period of investigation. Social as well as private rates of return for professional university-level courses such as accountancy, law and engineering are also enumerated. The rates for tertiary education are, in general, well above the prevailing <b>prime</b> <b>lending</b> <b>rates.</b> This has provided justification for the government to facilitate a study loan scheme for tertiary students so as to shift part of the burden for financing tertiary education to private individuals (students) who enjoy direct benefits. ...|$|R
40|$|In the Basel II era, {{management}} of {{interest rate risk}} in the banking book has become significant. In the first study of its kind, we develop a simulation based driver-driven approach to estimate the impact of interest rate volatility on the networth of Indian banks during the period 2002 - 2004. We derive the interest rates that drive changes in deposit and <b>prime</b> <b>lending</b> <b>rates</b> (PLR). Then we perform Monte Carlo simulation and multiple regressions, on these driver rates, to obtain simulated shocks to deposit rates and PLR. We use these simulated shocks to get the 99 % worst EVE loss for the sample banks. These losses are much larger than what the existing literature suggests. This is because, apart from repricing risk, we {{are the first to}} find evidence of significant basis risk. Our results have important policy implications both for banks and regulators.

40|$|The author {{proposes a}} micro-founded {{framework}} that incorporates an active banking sector into a dynamic stochastic general-equilibrium {{model with a}} financial accelerator. He evaluates {{the role of the}} banking sector in the transmission and propagation of the real effects of aggregate shocks, and assesses the importance of financial shocks in U. S. business cycle fluctuations. The banking sector consists of two types of profitmaximizing banks that offer different banking services and transact in an interbank market. Loans are produced using interbank borrowing and bank capital subject to a regulatory capital requirement. Banks have monopoly power, set nominal deposit and <b>prime</b> <b>lending</b> <b>rates,</b> choose their leverage ratio and their portfolio composition, and can endogenously default on a fraction of their interbank borrowing. Because it is costly to raise capital to satisfy the regulatory capital requirement, the banking sector attenuates the real effects of financial shocks, reduces macroeconomic volatilities, and helps stabilize the economy. The model also includes two unconventional monetary policies (quantitative and qualitative easing) that reduce the negative impacts of financial crises.

The {{justification for the}} study is to discover what we have learnt about {{the changes in the}} {{interest rate}} pass-through from the whole sale rate to intermediate rates after the capital reform of 2005. Evidence from the study will also aid monetary policy decisions for macro-economic management in Nigeria. We use monthly data for the period 2006 M 01 - 2015 M 01 based on ARDL approach. Our findings reveal that Interest Rate Pass-through (IRPT) affects DMBs products differently. In the case of deposit rates, pass-through is near complete in the short run for all products except for 12 month deposit rate. In case of lending rates, the <b>prime</b> <b>lending</b> <b>rate</b> pass-through was complete while the maximum lending rate was incomplete. The bounds test suggest the existence of a long-run relationship between the variables such that the speed of adjustment takes an average of 16 months for deposit rates and 7 months for <b>prime</b> <b>lending</b> <b>rate</b> before they return to their equilibrium positions. Based on the findings that pass-through of wholesale rate to DMBs retail rates is sufficiently high during the month, we conclude that monetary policy is reasonably effective in determining changes in the intermediate target in the short-run i...|$|E
