40|$|Highly {{stressed}} {{turbine blades}} made of Inconel 718 (DIN NiCr 19 NbMo (2. 4668); ASTM B 637; UNS N 07718) have to satisfy stringent requirements regarding durability and reliability. The impact of surface integrity on the fatigue {{strength of the}} workpiece material {{has proven to be}} of significant importance. An optimization of the surface integrity after wire EDM of Inconel 718 can be achieved using the surface finishing process <b>machine</b> <b>hammer</b> peening. <b>Machine</b> <b>hammer</b> peening is an incremental forming process which has the potential to induce residual compressive stresses and strain hardening while smoothing surface asperities. As the effect of <b>machine</b> <b>hammer</b> peening on surface integrity has not yet been completely investigated, this paper deals with its description and modeling of the unknown impact of <b>machine</b> <b>hammer</b> peening on the fatigue strength of Inconel 718. Wire EDM <b>and</b> <b>machine</b> <b>hammer</b> peening parameters maximizing the fatigue strength are presented. Experimental measurements are performed to quantify the surface integrity, especially surface roughness, compressive residual stresses and strain hardening, after wire EDM <b>and</b> subsequent <b>machine</b> <b>hammer</b> peening. The evaluation of the effect of surface integrity on the fatigue strength is carried out using a bending fatigue strength testing machine. Additionally, a finite element model is developed to analyze the surface integrity under load and to reveal the effects of difficult-to-measure properties on the fatigue strength. Based on the new knowledge gained during this work, a model to predict the fatigue strength using similitude theory is presented. Along with the previously analyzed correlations between surface integrity and fatigue strength, this allows a constructive setting of <b>machine</b> <b>hammer</b> peening parameters. Thereby, a significant new contribution to knowledge about the influence of <b>machine</b> <b>hammer</b> peening on surface integrity and fatigue strength of Inconel 718 is made. The presented approach can be easily transferred to other materials and workpiece geometries...|$|R

Manufacturing operations became increasingly automated and product innovation took ever greater importance. Starting in the 1990s various subsidiaries joined the Knipex Group. The fourth generation took over the company’s reins. Foreign sales offices were established, and nowadays more than 60 percent of output is exported to numerous countries worldwide.|$|R

Scottville grew at a slower pace than Collinsville because the mine which supported it was smaller and lacked government funding.

An original method of functional identification was elaborated, relying on observation of use-wear with a stereoscopic microscope (under 120).

A significant observation concerns the use of small handstones for grain dehusking and larger handstones for grain grinding.

40|$|Iron or {{manganese}} oxide rich rocks were constantly and intensively used by hunter- gatherers from around 300 kya. Nonetheless, few is none concerning the supply in raw ferruginous materials. The mine San Ramón 15 in {{northern part of}} the Chilean coast reveals an exceptional evidence of the extraction of iron and probably {{manganese oxide}} rich materials by groups of hunters-fishers-gatherers. Two extraction phases were determined during the excavation of the mine trench: the oldest one during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition (11000 - 8000 cal. BP) and the second one from 4300 cal. BP. A rich set of lithic <b>pounding</b> stones <b>and</b> <b>hammer</b> stones were recorded in the mine refus. The mine trench follows a various meters wide lenticular vein in the granodioritic bedrock from the Jurassic. The vein is principally made of hydrothermal pyrolusite, magnetite and goethite which are extremely hard materials and yellow to brown and black. Thus we suppose that the prehispanic miners intensively extracted a peculiar part of the vein, between the hard magnetite and the bedrock, so that few evidence of the material extracted in the mine were recorded. Our investigations focus on the determination of the characteristics of the quite messing materials which were extracted and we try to identify the following phases of transformation and utilisation. In order to address these issues, we sampled and document the lithology of the vein and of the numerous geological formations which provide iron rich materials in the neighbourhood. Furthermore, fragments of iron oxides from the mine refus, as well as red or black residues on tools from divers Archaic sites in the area (hammer stones in the mine, lithic weapons, grinding-stones and shells in the shellmiddens and rock-shelters) in order to compare their mineralogical and geochemical composition...|$|R

In China, Zhang Heng (78–139) wrote of plays with artificial fish and dragons, while a 6th-century text Xijing Zaji states that when Liu Bang (reigned as Emperor Gaozu of Han from 202–195 BC) came upon the treasury of the deceased Qin Shihuang (r. 221–210) in 206 BC, he found an entire mechanical orchestra of 1m (3ft) tall puppets dressed in silk and playing mouth organs, all powered by pulling ropes and blowing into tubes. As written in the Records of the Three Kingdoms, the engineer Ma Jun (fl. 220–265)—already associated with the differential gear system of the south-pointing chariot—invented a mechanical theater powered by a rotating wooden waterwheel for the entertainment of Emperor Ming's (r. 226–239 AD) court. With the waterwheel in motion, a number of mechanical puppets performed tricks, such as singing girls who played music and danced, other puppets who would beat drums and sound flutes when one puppet entered the scene, puppets dancing on balls, throwing swords, hanging upside down on rope ladders, etc. Other mechanical puppets dressed as government officials did tasks in their offices, puppets dressed as laborers did jobs of <b>pounding</b> <b>and</b> grinding (trip <b>hammer</b> <b>and</b> millstone), while others watched cockfighting, all moving simultaneously. Water-powered puppet theaters {{in the tradition of}} Ma Jun were created in later dynasties as well.|$|R

In this study, we examined macroscopic use-wear patterns on a sample of 60 wild macaque stone tools from Piak Nam Yai Island, Thailand, that had been collected following behavioural observation, in order to (i) quantify the wear patterns in terms of the types and distribution of use-damage on the stones, and (ii) develop a Use-Action Index (UAI) to differentiate axe hammers from pound hammers by wear patterns alone. We used the intensity of crushing damage on differing surface zones of the stones, as well as stone weight, to produce a UAI that had 92 % concordance when compared to how the stones had been used by macaques, as observed independently prior to collection. Our study is the first to demonstrate that quantitative archaeological use-wear techniques can accurately reconstruct the behavioural histories of non-human primate stone tools...|$|R

40|$|Background: The aim of {{the study}} was to answer the {{question}} of whether earplugs provide sufficient protection in the exposure to impulse noise generated during metalworking processes. Material and Methods: The noise generated by die forging <b>hammer</b> <b>and</b> punching <b>machine</b> was characterized. Using an acoustic test fixture, noise parameters (LCpeak, LAmax) under 24 earplugs, foam, winged and no-roll, were measured. Octave band method was used to calculate values of LAeq under earplugs. Results: It was found that in the case of punching machine the exposure limit value of A-weighted noise exposure level, normalized to an 8 -h working day (LEX, 8 h = 94. 8 dB) of noise present at the workstation, was exceeded, while in the case of die forging hammer both the exposure limit value of this parameter (LEX, 8 h = 108. 3 dB) and the exposure limit value of peak sound pressure level (LCpeak = 148. 9 dB) were exceeded. The assessment of noise parameters (LCpeak, LAmax, LAeq) under earplugs revealed that the noise attenuation can be insufficient, sufficient, or too high. Conclusions: Earplugs can be suitable hearing protection devices in metalworking processes. Of the 24 earplugs included in this study, 9 provided appropriate noise attenuation in the case of tested die forging <b>hammer</b> <b>and</b> 10 in the case of tested punching machine.
