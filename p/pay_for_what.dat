5|$|At {{the science}} fair, Steve causes a panic by announcing his pet {{tarantula}} has escaped, and Carly Beth is terrified of tarantulas. Steve creeps {{up behind her}} during the chaos, and pinches her leg {{to make it seem}} that the tarantula is biting her. Carly Beth flies into a frenzied panic, destroys her and Sabrina's project and is again humiliated in front of her teachers and classmates. Carly Beth vows that she will definitely make Steve <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> he did to her. She plots to go to a new store that has opened, which sells frightening costumes, and plans to scare Steve and Chuck as payback.|$|E
5|$|Hours after Isabel made landfall, President George W. Bush {{issued a}} major {{disaster}} declaration for 26 North Carolina counties, which allowed {{the use of}} federal personnel, equipment and lifesaving systems and the delivery of heavy-duty generators, plastic sheeting, tents, cots, food, water, medical aid and other essential supplies and materials for sustaining human life. The declaration also allocated federal funds for the long-term recovery of hurricane-stricken residents and business owners, {{as well as providing}} federal funds for the state and local governments to pay 75 percent of the eligible cost for debris removal and emergency services related to the hurricane, including requested emergency work undertaken by the federal government. By four days after the emergency declaration, assistance checks were mailed and used by residents to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> was not covered by their insurance.|$|E
5|$|During the war, all {{the uranium}} from the Congo {{had gone to}} the United States, as had that {{captured}} in Europe by the Alsos Mission, even though some of it passed through British hands. The entire output of the Shinkolobwe mine was contracted to the Combined Development Trust until 1956, but in March 1946 there were fears that the mine might be exhausted in 1947, resulting in a severe uranium shortage. After some negotiation, Groves and Chadwick agreed on a division of uranium ore production, with everything up to March 1946 going to the United States, and supplies being shared equally thereafter. At the Combined Policy Committee meeting on 31 July 1946, the financial arrangements were adjusted. Previously, the two countries had split the costs equally; henceforth each would only <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> they actually received. Britain was therefore able to secure the uranium it needed without having to outbid the United States, and paid for it in sterling, while receiving reimbursement for the supplies allocated to the United States in dollars, thus easing Britain's dollar shortage.|$|E

25|$|Fiona {{stops by}} the pawn shop to see Gideon, now that Emma has regained her memories, where {{it turns out}} that Fiona had {{reclaimed}} Gideon's heart with Curse. Then, she uses him to recover her own wand, which she uses to decipher the mysterious writings that Henry had scribbled in the page. Fiona then reads the inscriptions, which details the birth of Light and Darkness, their battle throughout the ages waged via their emissaries, the deaths of the previous Saviors and their enemies at each others' hands, and how the Final Battle will begin after the Emma's birth. After Gideon leaves to find Emma, Gold arrives in the shop, but Fiona fails to trick Gold into thinking that she had only come for her watch. When Gold confronts Fiona about her plans, she tells her son that once the Final Battle is over, the Curse will be lifted and they can be a family again. She also tells Gold that after she destroys all Light Magic, she will have so much power that she will be able to break the Laws of Magic at will, and she will even be able to bring back the dead. She tells him that she can bring back his first-born son, Baelfire, for him. She {{goes on to say that}} with her new powers, she will be able to make his family love him as the Dark One, so that he can keep his power. However, Gold knows that is will come with a steep price and tells her that he refuses to pay the price of magic anymore slipping Fiona's wand into his hand. He forces her onto the ground with magic vowing to make her <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> she did to Belle. Fiona tells Gold that she had deciphered Henry's writing. She learned that Darkness cannot destroy Light since Darkness isn't strong enough. However, Light can destroy Light. She explains she gave Gideon one final command; to kill Emma, and that even if she dies, Gideon will still be forced to carry out her command. Gold decides to test this and kills Fiona with her own wand, breaking the Dark Curse. This causes Snow, David, Regina, Hook, and Zelena to be transported back to Storybrooke from the Enchanted Forest while Emma and the other residents of Storybrooke regain their memories. Soon afterward Belle returns to Gold and comforts him over his actions, while Gideon arrives at the office with his own enchanted sword in hand. As expected, Gideon confronts Emma and is ready to face off against her.|$|E
500|$|The first Datchet Bridge was {{a wooden}} bridge {{commissioned}} by Queen Anne as the crossing was a convenient back-way to Windsor Castle. Responsibility for the upkeep {{and maintenance of}} the crossing later passed to the counties of Berkshire and Buckinghamshire over whose boundary the bridge spanned. There followed many decades of dispute between the counties over who should <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>what.</b> This culminated in 1836 with each county deciding {{to build their own}} half, in different materials and not touching in the middle. The resulting [...] "crazy erection", Buckinghamshire's side in wood and Berkshire's in iron, known as The Divided Bridge, was demolished in 1848 and is the only case on the Thames where an established bridge crossing site has completely disappeared.|$|E

A gang member in an interview explains that the group [...] "just decided they weren’t going to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> they were getting." [...] The store owner's son was hit with a bottle of beer, and two other youths smashed the glass front door of the store. Two officers from the 77th Street Division of the LAPD responded to this incident and, finding that the instigators had already left, completed a report.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Fox {{was accused}} of {{illegally}} enriching himself after photos of Fox and his wife surfaced in the popular Mexican magazine Quien. The photos appeared to show Fox's ranch as newly renovated. Soon after, columnists and radio hosts began to question how Fox was able to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> appeared to be extensive renovations on his house. Fox denounced the allegations {{as part of a}} smear campaign against him. He also claimed that he purchased his ranch in 1999, before he was elected president of Mexico. In 2012, the Procuraduría General de la República reopened the investigation, but there has since been no update as to the status of the investigation.|$|E
50|$|Tax {{resistance}} is {{the refusal to}} <b>pay</b> a tax <b>for</b> conscientious reasons (because the resister finds the government or its actions morally reprehensible). They typically do not find it relevant whether that the tax laws are themselves legal or illegal or whether they apply to them, and they {{are more concerned with}} not <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> they find to be grossly immoral, such as the bombing of innocents.|$|R

2500|$|Sales {{taxes are}} levied when a {{commodity}} is sold to its final consumer. Retail organizations contend that such taxes discourage retail sales. The {{question of whether}} they are generally progressive or regressive is a subject of much current debate. People with higher incomes spend a lower proportion of them, so a flat-rate sales tax will tend to be regressive. It is therefore common to exempt food, utilities and other necessities from sales taxes, since poor people spend {{a higher proportion of}} their incomes on these commodities, so such exemptions make the tax more progressive. This is the classic [...] "You <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> you spend" [...] tax, as only those who spend money on non-exempt (i.e. luxury) items pay the tax.|$|E
2500|$|Summer and Ed join in {{with the}} {{argument}} {{and there is a}} lot of shouting. Lucas explained [...] "Summer's aware they've overloaded the car, so she wants to keep calm. She can sense Chris is getting stressed by all the yelling, so she's very tense." [...] As Chris tries to concentrate on the road, Andrew accidentally bumps his arm and he suddenly loses control of the car, which swerves, hits an embankment and flips over before coming to a stop. Sophie is critically injured after being thrown from the vehicle, while Andrew has a serious head injury and Ed is also in a bad way. Rhys Lawson (Ben Barber) comes across the scene and puts his own life at risk to start [...] "frantic" [...] rescue efforts. He cuts his hand in the process, but refuses to get it looked when the emergency services arrive. Rhys eventually finds Sophie and when she reaches the hospital, she is rushed into surgery. A writer for Soap World commented that [...] "a terrified" [...] Natasha is worried Ed will not wake up, before she can tell him she loves him. Mason stated that Chris is wracked with guilt and worried for his friends. Things become worse for him when Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) arrives at the hospital and, after learning his son and niece are in a serious condition, threatens to sue him. Mason revealed that Paul is angry and wants someone to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> happened, while Dennis explained [...] "Yes, it's typical Paul - someone has to pay and he decides that Chris should take all of the blame before he knows the full story." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{is unclear}} {{what has been}} spent so far on {{planning}} and preparing for each pilot cull and who exactly is <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> <b>what,</b> i.e. <b>what</b> taxpayers are <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> and <b>what</b> the farming industry is <b>paying</b> <b>for.</b> Costings of the culls have not factored in socio-economic costs, such as tourism and any potential boycotts of dairy products from the cull zones. Others opposed to the cull argue that for economic reasons the government have chosen the most inhumane approach to disease eradication. Tony Dean, Chairperson of the Gloucestershire Badger Group, warns that some badgers will not be killed outright: [...] "You {{have got to be}} a good marksman to kill a badger outright, with one shot... Many of the badgers will be badly injured. They will go back underground after being shot, probably badly maimed. They will die a long lingering death underground from lead poisoning etc. We {{are going to have a}} lot of cubs left underground where their mothers have been shot above ground." [...] He also suggests that domestic pets will be at risk in the cull areas, as some farmers will mistake black and white cats and dogs for badgers.|$|R
