50|$|During {{embryonic}} development, the 21-kD protein FGF4 {{functions as}} a signaling molecule that is involved in many important processes. Studies using Fgf4 gene knockout mice showed developmental defects in embryos both in vivo and in vitro, revealing that FGF4 facilitates the survival and growth of the inner cell mass during the postimplantation phase of development by acting as an autocrine or paracrine ligand. FGFs produced in the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) are critical for the proper forelimb and hindlimb outgrowth. FGF signaling in the AER is involved in regulating limb digit number and cell death in the interdigital mesenchyme. When FGF signaling dynamics and regulatory processes are altered, postaxial polydactyly and cutaneous syndactyly, two phenotypic abnormalities collectively known as <b>polysyndactyly,</b> can occur in the limbs. <b>Polysyndactyly</b> is observed when an excess of Fgf4 is expressed in limb buds of wild-type mice. In mutant limb buds that do not express Fgf8, the expression of Fgf4 still results in <b>polysyndactyly,</b> but Fgf4 is also able to rescue all skeletal defects that arise {{from the lack of}} Fgf8. Therefore, the Fgf4 gene compensates for the loss of the Fgf8 gene, revealing that FGF4 and FGF8 perform similar functions in limb skeleton patterning and limb development. Studies of zebrafish Fgf4 knockdown embryos demonstrated that when Fgf4 signaling is inhibited, randomized left-right patterning of the liver, pancreas, and heart takes place, showing that Fgf4 is a crucial gene involved in developing left-right patterning of visceral organs. Furthermore, unlike the role of FGF4 in limb development, FGF4 and FGF8 have distinct roles and function independently in the process of visceral organ left-right patterning.Fgf signaling pathway has also been demonstrated to drive hindgut identity during gastrointestinal development, and the up regulation of the Fgf4 in pluripotent stem cell has been used to direct their differentiation for the generation of intestinal Organoids and tissues in vitro.|$|E
50|$|Majewski's {{polydactyly}} syndrome, {{also known}} as polydactyly with neonatal chondrodystrophy type I, short rib-polydactyly syndrome type II, and short rib-polydactyly syndrome, is a lethal form of neonatal dwarfism characterized by osteochondrodysplasia (skeletal abnormalities {{in the development of}} bone and cartilage) with a narrow thorax, <b>polysyndactyly,</b> disproportionately short tibiae, thorax dysplasia, hypoplastic lungs and respiratory insufficiency.

50|$|Cases of <b>polysyndactyly</b> are {{approached}} {{through a}} standard opposing zig-zag incision. The incision is favored toward the accessory digit, preserving extra skin for subsequent closure.

50|$|Other {{names for}} acropectoral {{syndrome}} include ACRPS, Syndactyly, preaxial polydactyly and sternal deformity, and ACRP syndrome. This syndrome {{is characterized by}} syndactyly of all fingers/toes, pre axial polydactyly in the hands/feet, and upper sternum malformations. More specifically affected individuals show soft tissue syndactyly of all fingers and toes. 14 out of the 22 individuals had pre axial polydactyly, as well had a blind-ending U-shaped sinus in the chest wall or a prominent upper sternum. Other symptoms included an extra big toe and an extra thumb (6). Treatment of individuals affected with this syndrome include oral pathology, facial and limb plastic surgery, and pediatric otolaryngology (7). This syndrome is different than acropectorovertebral dysplasia because the vertebral anomalies seen in acropectorovertebral dysplasia were not observed in these patients. This syndrome also differed from acropectorovertebral dysplasia because of the carpal, tarsal, and metatarsal synostoses {{as well as the}} preaxial polydactyly that occurred in the feet {{as well as in the}} hands. Soft tissue syndactyly was more prominent that in acropectorovertebral dysplasia. The limb defects seen in acropectoral syndrome are also similar to those that occur in other dominantly inherited types of preaxial polydactyly, including preaxial polydactyly type II (PPD2), preaxial polydactyly type III (PPD3) and triphalangeal thumb- <b>polysyndactyly</b> (TPT-PS).

The genetic basis of LSS is currently unknown. LSS shows phenotypic overlap with Haas-type <b>polysyndactyly</b> (HTS) regarding the digital phenotype. Here we report on five unrelated families with overlapping microduplications encompassing the Sonic hedgehog (SHH) limb enhancer ZPA regulatory sequence (ZRS) on chromosome 7 q 36. Clinically, the patients show <b>polysyndactyly</b> phenotypes and various types of lower limb malformations ranging from syndactyly to mirror image polydactyly with duplications of the fibulae. We show that larger duplications of the ZRS region (> 80 kb) are associated with HTS, whereas smaller duplications (< 80 kb) result in the LSS phenotype.

40|$|AbstractAnterior–posterior (A/P) limb {{patterning}} in vertebrates {{is determined}} by the counteraction between the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) and the Gli 3 transcription factor. Shh exerts its effect on Gli 3 by regulating the full-length Gli 3 protein processing to generate a Gli 3 repressor gradient along the A/P axis of the limb. However, {{it is not clear whether}} the full-length Gli 3 is an activator in vivo and plays any role in the limb patterning. Here we show that mouse limbs expressing only a Gli 3 repressor form exhibit mild <b>polysyndactyly</b> and a partial loss of digit identity, while limbs expressing only a full-length Gli 3 protein display severe <b>polysyndactyly</b> and a complete loss of digit identity. Interestingly, when the full-length Gli 3 and the repressor are equally expressed in the limb, the digit patterning is overall normal except for an extra anterior digit. Furthermore, in the presence of one Gli 3 wild type allele, a Gli 3 mutant allele that expresses only the full-length form can rescue the Shh mutant digit phenotype to a great extent. The full-length Gli 3 protein can also activate Shh target gene expression without Shh. Thus, our data indicate that the full-length Gli 3 protein is an activator in vivo and that the ratio of the Gli 3 activator to repressor, but neither the Gli 3 repressor gradient nor the Gli 3 activator/repressor ratio gradient, determines limb digit patterning...|$|E

The IHH clone is 89 % complete and encodes a protein 94. 6 % identical to its murine homologue. IHH is expressed in adult kidney and liver. SHH expression was not detected in adult tissues examined; however, it is expressed in fetal intestine, liver, lung, and kidney. SHH mapped to chromosome 7 q and IHH to chromosome 2 by PCR with DNA from a panel of rodent-human somatic cell hybrids.

40|$|AbstractMulefoot disease (MFD) is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder of phenotypically variable expression that causes syndactyly in certain strains of cows. MFD maps {{to a narrow}} interval on bovine chromosome 15 that is syntenic to human chromosome 11 p 12 –p 11. 2. This region contains MEGF 7 /LRP 4 (approved gene symbol LRP 4), a gene that encodes {{a member of the}} multifunctional low-density lipoprotein receptor gene family. Targeted and naturally occurring mutations in the murine Megf 7 /Lrp 4 gene, a putative coreceptor in the Wnt signaling pathway, cause <b>polysyndactyly</b> in the rodent. Thus, Megf 7 /Lrp 4 is a strong candidate for the MFD mutation. Using PCR analysis of tissue samples and sperm from confirmed homozygous MFD carriers, we have identified a functional single base pair mutation in the affected animals. We show that a G → A transition at the first nucleotide in the splice donor site of intron 37 completely disables this splice site. The abnormal splicing that is caused by this mutation predicts the generation of a dysfunctional membrane-anchored receptor lacking the normal cytoplasmic domain. These findings confirm that {{autosomal recessive}} loss-of-function mutations in Megf 7 /Lrp 4 result in phenotypically similar forms of syndactyly in different mammalian species and that such mutations are the cause of MFD in bovines...|$|E

Typical GCPS combines <b>polysyndactyly</b> of hands and feet and craniofacial features.

Most of mutations are novel and consistent with the previously reported genotype-phenotype correlation. Our results also show a correlation between the location of the mutation and abnormal corpus callosum observed in some patients with GCPS.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Sonic {{hedgehog}} (SHH) {{plays an}} important role in defining the anterior-posterior axis in the developing limbs. A highly conserved non-coding sequence about approximately 1 Mb upstream from the sonic hedgehog gene (SHH) was shown to be a long range regulator for SHH expression in the limb bud. Point mutations within this non-coding regulatory region designated ZRS lead to ectopic expression of Shh in the anterior margin of the limb bud, as shown in mice, and cause the human triphalangeal thumb and <b>polysyndactyly</b> (TPT-PS) phenotype. Even though this association is well established, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated a large pedigree with variable TPT-PS. A single nucleotide exchange within the SHH limb regulator sequence was excluded, but locus specific microsatellite marker analyses confirmed a linkage to this region. Subsequently, array comparative genomic hybridisation (array CGH) was carried out using a submegabase whole human genome tiling path bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) array revealing a microduplication in 7 q 36. 3 in affected individuals. A duplicated region of 588, 819 bp comprising the ZRS was identified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and direct sequencing. CONCLUSION: A novel microduplication in 7 q 36. 3 results in a similar TPT-PS phenotype as caused by single nucleotide alterations in the ZRS, the limb specific SHH regulatory element. Duplications can be added to the growing list of mechanisms that cause abnormalities of long range transcriptional control...|$|E

The expression of the phenotype was variable and ranged from unilateral TPT to bilateral TPT, preaxial du-, tri-, or quadruplication of the thumb, or syndactyly of multiple thumbs. There were 112 affected individuals in the pedigree. Previous linkage analyses on apparently similar phenotypes have identified a locus at 7 q 36 [Heutink et al., 1994, Nature Genet 6 : 287 - 291; Tsukurov et al., 1994]. To map the gene responsible for the TPT-PSD in family UR 002, we performed linkage analysis in DNA from 47 affected and 7 normal individuals. Marker D 7 S 550, located at 7 q 36, yielded a maximum LOD score of 11. 31 at theta = 0. 00. Additional markers in the region also showed no recombination. These data indicate that the gene responsible for the hand abnormality in pedigree UR 002 maps to the same region as that in previous pedigrees with similar phenotype. Further analyses of recombinants among all the linked families by using new polymorphic markers will narrow the critical genomic region and facilitate positional cloning of the elusive gene...|$|E
