40|$|Recovery of {{chromated}} {{copper arsenate}} (CCA) -treated wood for reuse {{has been the}} focus of several international research groups due to the imminent disposal problem created when large quantities of CCA-treated wood ultimately come out of service. Bioleaching with Bacillus licheniformis CC 01 and oxalic acid extraction are two methods known to remove significant quantities of metals from CCA-treated wood. Remediated particulate CCA-treated southern pine was reassembled into particleboard (PB) using 10 % urea-formaldehyde resin. Particleboard panels were evaluated for internal bond (IB), modulus of elasticity (MOE), modulus of rupture (MOR), thickness swell (TS) and water absorption compared to particleboard manufactured from virgin southern pine and CCA-treated southern pine. Particleboard panels prepared from the remediated chips showed an average 28 % reduction in IB and a 13 % reduction in MOR compared to values for PB prepared with virgin chips under the pressing parameters used in this study, though individual IB values for all specimens were above the ANSI standard for medium density particleboard. An 8 % increase in MOE in the remediated chip PB compared to the virgin chip PB may indicate densification of the fiber surface as a result of the acid extraction step of the remediation process. Thickness swell and water absorption after 24 -hour submersion also increased in PB prepared from remediated chips (15 % and 14 %, respectively). We conclude that <b>pressing</b> <b>parameter</b> optimization could alleviate decreases in MOR and IB seen in PB made from remediated chips, and that the effects of acid extraction on MOR and IB properties should be further evaluated.

The work that has been done has focused on two main factors, namely, powder characteristics and <b>pressing</b> <b>parameters.</b> AB Sandvik Coromant produces tools and tooling systems for metal cutting. They have some problems in their production of inserts. The problem is that cracks sometimes occur {{in the body of the}} insert, after it´s pressed. In order to investigate this, a preliminary study was made in which production principles were studied. A historical survey has also been made with the help of statistics from the last two years of production. This survey was then followed by a number of experiments in which different factors that possibly had an influence in the cracking was investigated. The work resulted in that one of the <b>pressing</b> <b>parameters</b> was found as a factor whose affect on the cracking is large. The investigation also led to that one of the powder characteristics could be considered as a factor whose affect on the cracking is insignificant. This finding applies to the geometries and powder varieties that were included in the experiments. Otherwise, it was found that further work is required to make any general conclusions...|$|R

40|$|Several {{critical}} {{issues of the}} diffusion bonding process and interfacial properties of continuous single crystal Al 2 O 3 (sapphire) fiber-reinforced NiAl matrix composites were studied. The first issue was the contributions of different densification mechanisms during the diffusion bonding process and the prediction of optimal hot <b>pressing</b> <b>parameters</b> for NiAl matrix coated fibers (MCFs). The choice of suitable process <b>parameters</b> of hot <b>pressing</b> is important in determining {{the properties of the}} final composite. Acceptable process parameters have to ensure fabrication of fully dense and void free composites with tolerable fiber damage as well as minimal chemical reactions between fiber and matrix in order to prevent the formation of harmful reaction products in the interface. Based on an analytical diffusion bonding model, in which primary creep of the NiAl matrix – that was studied by creep tests and dynamic tests – was included, the effects of the hot <b>pressing</b> <b>parameters,</b> i. e. pressure, temperature and time, on the deformation behavior and evolution of the microstructure of the matrix in NiAl composites, were simulated. Optimal parameters for the NiAl MCFs of 1300 °C / 40 MPa / 30 ~ 60 minutes were recommended. The predictions were compared to experiments, and good agreement between the simulated and experimental results was found. The second issue was the thermal residual stress (TRS) in NiAl composites after thermal mechanical processing due to different coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) of fiber and matrix. Without a BN interlayer the simulated compressive axial TRS in sapphire fiber can be very high in a temperature range of 680 - 790 K and will result in fiber damage. By introducing a BN interlayer, the TRS level decreased and the fiber damage was lowered. However, it caused also a low interfacial strength that reduced the load transfer efficiency from the matrix to the fiber and thus, reduced the composite strength. A higher fiber volume fraction of approximately 40 - 60 % can effectively reduce the TRS in the sapphire fiber and therefore, fiber damage would be mitigated or even eliminated. The simulations were consistent with measurements by nano-indentation. The third issue was the interfacial properties of NiAl composites. By using push-out tests, the interface shear stress for complete debonding was measured. An interfacial model was developed, in which the thermal residual shear stress at the interface and the frictional stress at the interface were included to extract the intrinsic interfacial strength of NiAl composites. According to the simulation, initial debonding can occur at the top or bottom side depending on sample thickness. The push-out test was also numerically simulated at elevated temperatures by assuming a constant value of the interfacial shear strength. Overall, a diffusion bonding model was developed to predict the optimal hot <b>pressing</b> <b>parameters</b> for achieving fully dense and void free composites with tolerable properties; TRS simulations recommended a suitable fiber volume fraction range for lower fiber damage. The models can be used as guidelines to design tough composites for future gas turbine blades...|$|R
50|$|Urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins are dominantly used in {{the medium}} density {{fiberboard}} (MDF) industry because of their low cost and fast curing characteristics. However, pressures {{on the use of}} UF resins are mounting steadily due to potential problems associated with formaldehyde emission. On the other hand, phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resins are more durable and do not emit formaldehyde after cure. The industry has traditionally shied away from using PF resins due primarily to their higher cost and much slower curing rate than UF resins. However, the press times for PF-bonded fiberboard can be substantially reduced by manipulating the fiber mat temperatures, molecular weight distribution of PF resins and <b>pressing</b> <b>parameters.</b> As a result, the press times for PF-bonded fiberboard can be made comparable to those for UF-bonded fiberboard. Also, the resin content required for PF-bonded fiberboard is less than 5% to achieve a good board quickly. This is considerably lower than that required for UF-bonded fiberboard.|$|R

40|$|For {{characterization}} {{and assessment}} of service behavior of mold materials and mold coatings for glass forming opterations, like e. g. glass container manufacturing, a testing procedure and corresponding laboratory apparatus was developed. The testing procedure resembles industrial working conditions, the mold material specimens are subjected to cyclic loading by pressing small gobs (soda-lime glass) from a melting crucible under defined non-isothermal conditions. A function of <b>pressing</b> <b>parameters,</b> especially mold temperature, molding pressure and service time of the mold specimens, the sticking behavior, surface structure of the molded glass objects and corrosion and wear of the mold surfaces are analyzed. The sturdiness of sticking may be described by a Gaussian distribution, and is quantified by recording the time interval necessary for separating the glass blank from the mold surface using a special separation procedure. The duration of sticking increases steeply with mold temperature within a narrow temperature interval of 20 - 50 K. The sticking characteristics of each tested bulk material and coating can be described by two material specific values: the lower and the upper sticking temperatures. The lower sticking temperatures exhibit a linear dependence on the thermal diffusivity of the mold materials, whereas the upper sticking temperature additionally depends on chemical and structural properties of the mold surfaces. Corrosion and wear of the mold materials in contact with hot glass is enhanced in this testing procedure due to conducting those pressing experiments well above the lower sticking temperature, which yields significant differences in corrosion behaviour in short time laboratory experiments...|$|R

Designs of experiments (DoE) {{have been used for}} evaluating the effect of hot <b>pressing</b> <b>parameters</b> (pressure, temperature, and time) on the MEA electrical performances. Full factorial 2 (3) DoE showed that the most important <b>parameter</b> is the <b>pressing</b> temperature. Surface response methodology indicated a non-monotonous behavior of the MEA electrical performances with respect to the pressing temperature. The MEA electrical performances increased with the pressing temperature in the temperature range from 100 to 115 A degrees C, and decreased significantly in the temperature range from 115 to 130 A degrees C. This behavior was attributed to drastic changes of the NafionA (R) 112 membrane properties and membrane/electrode interface over this temperature range.

40|$|Recently, {{closed cell}} {{cellular}} metals have been gaining {{a very high}} interest due to their unique characteristic applications in various technology domains. They combine the advantages of a metal with the structural advantages of foam. Among these, aluminium foams have created a great interest due to their light weight structure and their various applications in the automotive, aerospace and allied industries. Aluminium foam possesses high stiffness and low density, it has good energy-absorbing properties making it good for crash-protection and packaging and it has attractive heat-transfer properties that permit to use these materials to cool electronic equipment and as heat exchangers in engines. However, its manufacturing techniques and characterization methods need more attention. The inadequate knowledge on the physical phenomena governing the foaming process does not allow to obtain products with repeatable characteristics. In this paper aluminium foams in various fabrication components were produced by applying the powder compact melting method. In particular metal powders (AlSi 7) and powdered gas-releasing blowing agents (TiH 2) were mixed and subsequently pressed to obtain a foamable precursor material.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{studies on}} the self-bonding of veneers, and investigations into the properties of boards obtained by hot-pressing beech veneers without adhesives. The raw material is pressed at temperatures from 200 to 250 ºC, at pressures from 4 to 6 MPa and pressing times from 240 to 360 s. The hot-pressing of five layers of veneers results in a self-bonded, compressed, densified board, darker than the raw material. The manufacturing process was optimised using a statistical analysis, the response surface experimental design method. The input factors were the <b>pressing</b> <b>parameters</b> and the output factors were characteristics of the product, the raw material properties being kept constant. The results showed correlations between the <b>pressing</b> <b>parameters,</b> especially temperature, as input data and the physical and mechanical properties as responses. Resistance to water absorption and swelling as well as shear strength, bending strength, and hardness were all enhanced by more severe pressing conditions. All the samples pressed at 250 ºC became water-resistant while samples pressed at 200 ºC delaminated rapidly in water. It {{was found that the}} colour of the edges can be used as an indication of the hardness. Chemical investigations were performed on samples taken from veneers (raw material), bond-lines and inner parts of pressed veneer. A High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis was used to detect and compare the levels of water-soluble monosaccharides (glucose and fructose) in the veneer before pressing and the levels of 5 -hydroxymethyl-furfural (HMF) and furfural in boards. From the results obtained in this thesis it is suggested, that besides other degraded compounds of hemicelluloses, the monosaccharides were transformed into hydroxymethyl-furfural during hot-pressing that could further participate in forming new browning compounds that are related to the bonding phenomenon. The UV spectroscopic analysis to evaluate the content of water-soluble phenols showed that the bond-line had a higher amount of conjugated phenols than the inner veneer suggesting a migration of degraded lignin towards the veneer surfaces during pressing. A CP/MAS 13 C NMR study on the solid material showed that the presence of β-ether structures and methoxyl groups in lignin was higher in the bond-line, supporting the hypothesis of a migration of lignin and possibly a condensation reaction occurring at higher temperatures, explaining the water-resistance property acquired by the boards. In a comparative study, oxidative activation with hydrogen peroxide and ferrous sulfate as a catalyst was performed before pressing. Boards made from beech veneer subjected to the pre-treatment step showed a greater mass loss, a lower thickness swelling but also a somewhat lower shear strength. For beech veneers such an oxidative pre-treatment step could be used to gain water-resistant boards pressed at lower pressing temperatures or shorter times than those needed to bond untreated veneers. Scots pine veneers were found to be less suitable for self-bonding than beech veneers. Boards of Scots pine hot-pressed without the oxidative pre-treatment delaminated in water, whereas, under the same pressing conditions, boards made from pre-treated veneers showed a water-resistant bond-line.

The intensity of sticking at each mold temperature underlies a statistical distribution, and is quantified by recording the time interval necessary for separating the glass blank from the mold surface using a well defined debonding procedure. The duration of sticking increases steeply with mold temperature within a narrow temperature interval of 20 - 50 K. The sticking characteristics of each tested material (stellite, cast iron, coated steel, bronze) can be described by two values: the lower and the upper sticking temperatures. A definition for each is given in the presented work. For the lower sticking temperatures a nearly linear dependence on the thermal diffusivity of the mold materials was found. The upper sticking temperature depends additionally on chemical and structural properties of the mold surfaces. Corrosion and wear of the mold materials are monitored by analyzing abraded particles on the molded glass surfaces and by stylometry. Due to carrying out these experiments at and above the lower sticking temperature (i. e. well above mold temperatures run in industrial processes), significant differences in corrosion behavior in short time laboratory experiments are obtained...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{manipulation}} of mechanical and thermal interfaces {{is essential for}} the design of modern composites. Amongst these are copper carbon composites which can exhibit excellent heat conductivities if the Cu/C interface is affected by a suitable interlayer to minimize the Thermal Contact Resistance (TCR) and to maximize the adhesion strength between Cu and C. In this paper we report on the effect of boron based interlayers on wetting, mechanical adhesion and on the TCR of Cu coatings deposited on glassy carbon substrates by magnetron sputtering. The interlayers were 5 nm thick and consisted of pure B and B with additions of the carbide forming metals Mo, Ti and Cr in the range of 5 at. % relative to B. The interlayers were deposited by RF magnetron sputtering from either a pure B target or from a composite target. The interlayer composition was checked by Auger Electron Spectroscopy and found to be homogenous within the whole film. The system C-substrate/interlayer/Cu coating was characterized in as deposited samples and samples heat treated for 30 min at 800 °C under High Vacuum (HV), which mimics typical hot <b>pressing</b> <b>parameters</b> during composite formation. Material transport during heat treatment was investigated by Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS). The de-wetting and hole formation in the Cu coating upon heat treatment were studied by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The adhesion of the Cu coating was evaluated by mechanical pull-off testing. The TCR was assessed by infrared photothermal radiometry (PTR). A correlation between the adhesion strength and the value of the TCR which was measured by PTR was determined for as deposited as well as for heat treated samples...|$|R
40|$|The hot {{pressing}} operation {{is one of}} the most important operations in medium density fibreboard (MDF) manufacture. Complicated dynamic interactions occur during pressing, including heat transfer, moisture movement, development of gas pressure, internal stress development and relaxation, wood consolidation, resin curing, bonding between particles and eventual development of a nonuniform density distribution through the panel thickness. Consequently the mat experiences continuously changing internal conditions (temperature and moisture content) as the pressing operation proceeds. The vertical density profile (VDP) {{is one of the}} most important properties that determine MDF strength and physical properties. The influence of the VDP on the board properties is generally recognised, but the formation of the density profile and their specific effects on the board performance have proved difficult to quantify. A mathematical model based on theoretical analysis and experimental information is being developed. In the model, the mat is divided into a number of thin parallel layers. The deformation of each layer is a function of stress, temperature and moisture content of the layer. The model considers the variation of the mat mechanical and rheological properties with moisture content and temperature. The changes in temperature and moisture content are provided by a separate heat and mass transfer model. The press model can predict internal pressure, layer deformation and density across the thickness during pressing. The performance of the model was validated by experiments conducted in a pilot-scale press. Twenty two MDF boards were made with different <b>pressing</b> <b>parameters,</b> and the VDP were measured and compared with the simulation results from the model. The model could predict the density profile with an acceptable accuracy for the main variables that control the manufacturing of MDF boards...|$|R
40|$|A {{programme}} {{of research}} was undertaken {{to identify the}} mechanisms of formation of voids and defects in aluminium alloy C 354 and C 355 castings. The following aspects of the material processing were studied as independent and linked effects: casting technique and associated variables, hot isostatic <b>pressing</b> cycle <b>parameters,</b> and heat treatment cycle. Microstructure related driving forces for defect formation were quantified using differential scanning calorimetry and quantitative metallography and surface effects investigated using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It was shown that by controlling key variables within casting, the component can become less sensitive to subsequent defect evolution from further thermal processing. Optimised parameters were defined and the mechanism of defect formation elucidated. A Non Destructive Testing (NDT) method {{for the detection of}} defects within C 354 components was developed...|$|R
