50|$|In 2012, {{the company}} locked out workers at a {{locomotive}} plant in London, Ontario, Canada and demanded some accept up to a 50% cut in pay, {{in order to}} become cost-competitive with comparable Caterpillar manufacturing facilities in the United States. The move created controversy in Canada, with some complaining the plant was acquired under false pretenses. Retail store Mark's Work Wearhouse began <b>pulling</b> <b>Caterpillar</b> boots from its shelves as a result.|$|E
5000|$|Sherridon {{originated}} as {{the service}} centre for the nearby Sherritt Gordon nickel mines. The mine closed in 1952, {{resulting in the}} equipment {{and many of the}} workers and families relocating to Lynn Lake. In 1949 the first house from Sherridon was sleighed to Lynn Lake, Manitoba as a test run over the 160 miles of cat train trails. Over the next three years, 208 buildings were moved to Lynn Lake from Sherridon. Houses, stores, banks and churches were loaded on sleighs and <b>pulled</b> by <b>caterpillar</b> tractors over the ice and snow to Lynn Lake.|$|R
50|$|He {{enjoys the}} scent of trees before {{stumbling}} into a bush, where he hears birdsong, drawing his attention {{to a couple of}} bluebirds courting. When the bluebirds kiss, two bird chicks jump up from the nest singing. A couple of playful lambs hop by, spurring Pluto to mimic them by hopping as well. His hopping causes him to hit his head on a low-hanging branch and fall yet again into another bush, scaring out rabbits and quails. As one train of quails flees from him, one quail chick lags behind and Pluto decides to run after it, mimicking its way of running. Pluto and the quail stops abruptly as they both hear a deep, bass voice singing about springtime. The voice is echoing out of a tiny burrow in the ground, to which the quail chick puts its ears to better listen to the singing. Suddenly, a fuzzy green caterpillar pops out of the burrow and continues to sing, though now in a high falsetto. The quail is delighted to see food present itself so easily and opens its mouth in anticipation. The caterpillar, halfway through singing does a double-take as he finally notices the quail eyeing him hungrily. The caterpillar reaches out with two of his hands and daintily closes the quail's beak, smiling at it shyly. Bewildered at having its mouth closed, the quail gives the caterpillar enough time to launch itself out of the burrow only to dive headfirst back inside. Not willing to let its prey escape so easily, the quail thrusts it head into the burrow after the caterpillar, manages to bite onto the caterpillar's tail and starts to slowly <b>pull</b> the <b>caterpillar</b> back out. To continue his mimicry, Pluto clamps his teeth on the quail's tail feathers and also starts pulling, lifting the quail into the air, and stretching the caterpillar to more than three times its original length. The caterpillar continues to keep his head inside the burrow while flailing his legs in desperation even though the sound of stretching can be heard. Finally, the quail's tail feathers give out, causing the tug of war to end with Pluto's head whipping back, red feathers floating everywhere. When Pluto investigates, he can see that the force of the caterpillar snapping back to his original length had pulled the quail halfway into the burrow with its head facing out. Underground, the caterpillar sees the quail's rear plugging up his hole, so in vengeance, he uses his many legs to repeatedly kick the quail's rear until the quail is forced out of the burrow like popping champagne cork.|$|R
