25|$|Mining {{operations}} use crushers, commonly {{classified by}} {{the degree to which}} they fragment the starting material, with primary and secondary crushers handling coarse materials, and tertiary and quaternary crushers reducing ore particles to finer gradations. Each crusher is designed to work with a certain maximum size of raw material, and often delivers its output to a screening machine which sorts and directs the product for further processing. Typically, crushing stages are followed by milling stages if the materials need to be further reduced. Additionally rockbreakers are typically located next to a crusher to reduce oversize material too large for a crusher. Crushers are used to reduce particle size enough so that the material can be processed into finer particles in a grinder. A typical <b>processing</b> <b>line</b> at a mine might consist of a crusher followed by a SAG mill followed by a ball mill. In this context, the SAG mill and ball mill are considered grinders rather than crushers.|$|E

50|$|The conga line is {{a novelty}} dance that {{was derived from the}} Cuban {{carnival}} dance of the same name and became popular in the US in the 1930s and 1950s. The dancers form a long, <b>processing</b> <b>line,</b> which would usually turn into a circle. It has three shuffle steps on the beat, followed by a kick that is slightly ahead of the fourth beat. The conga, a term sometimes mistakenly believed to be derived from the African region of Congo, is both a lyrical and danceable genre, rooted in the music of carnival troupes or comparsas.|$|E
50|$|There is also fecal {{matter in}} the intestines. While the {{slaughter}} process removes the feathers and intestines, only visible fecal matter is removed. The high speed automated processes at the abattoir are not designed to remove this fecal contamination on the feather and skin. The high speed processing equipment tend to spray the contamination around to the birds going down the <b>processing</b> <b>line,</b> and the equipment on the line itself. At one or more points on most abattoirs, chemical sprays and baths (e.g. bleach, acids, peroxides, etc.) are used to partially rinse off or kill this bacterial contamination. Unfortunately, the fecal contamination, once it has occurred, especially in the various membranes between the skin and muscle, is impossible to completely remove.|$|E

40|$|High-speed <b>processing</b> <b>lines</b> are {{fundamental}} to the manufacturing processes of several industries, including food and beverage, consumer products, and pharmaceuticals. A high-speed process is defined here as a process where the volume and rate ofjobs is such that discrete modeling and analysis cannot be done effectively. Traditionally, simulation analysis of high-speed <b>processing</b> <b>lines</b> has required a series of aggregations and simplifying assumptions to address the large volumes encountered. These approximations often cause the models to be poor predictors of realworld systems. HiSpeed$im is a powerful, new approach for analyzing high-speed systems. It incorporates an interface and algorithmic engine specifically designed for simulating the complex control logic and equipment of high-speed processing. HiSpeed$im also leverages the powerful simulation platform of SIMAN/Arena. This combines the ease of use of a simulator and {{the speed of a}} custom-written product with the complete power and flexibility of the Arena general-purpose tool. ...|$|R

50|$|As {{farmland}} {{was settled}} and cleared, {{a number of}} small dairy factories were established to process the supply of milk for consumption as milk, cheese or other dairy products. As recently as the mid-1980s the dairy factory at the western end of Woodville, on State Highway 2 heading towards the Manawatu Gorge, operated a cheese <b>processing</b> <b>line</b> and a 'factory shop' selling dairy produce direct to the public. A thriving sheep and beef economy at one stage supported a number of local trucking firms and carriers, among them Gunn Transport and Hawkes Bay Farmers Transport, both of which were based at the now-derelict site at the corner of State Highway 2/Vogel Street and the Wairarapa bypass. These business were only economic in the pre-deregulated transport industry that existed prior to the Rogernomics reforms of the Lange Labour Government elected in 1984. With the lifting of distance restrictions (vehicles over a certain weight were at one stage restricted to travelling only 150 km from their geographic base) Woodville's role as a transport hub quickly fell away.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{significant}} {{advantage of}} IQF technology {{is its ability}} to separate the products during the freezing process, which results in products of higher quality when compared to those which are block frozen for example. This advantage is also important for food sustainability as it allows the defrost and use of the exact needed quantity as opposed to defrosting a bigger block and dispose of the unneeded or unused portion. There is a range of IQF technologies, but the main concept is to transport the product into the freezer {{with the help of a}} <b>processing</b> <b>line</b> belt or infeed shaker. Inside the freezer the product travels through the freezing zone and comes out on the other side. The transportation of the product inside the freezer can be achieved through different technologies depending on the IQF freezer’s brand. There are solutions based on transportation belts inside the freezer which is similar to a conveyor belt. Other latest innovations include bed plates on which the product lands and an asymmetrical movement is used for making the product advance by itself in the freezer.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we tried}} to improve a given {{stochastic}} <b>processing</b> <b>line</b> which is perfectly balanced. By introducing flexibility to a stochastic <b>processing</b> <b>line,</b> we could achieve the benefit of resource pooling. When we apply pri-ority sequencing to the flexible <b>processing</b> <b>line,</b> we could attain additional improvement in reducing mean throughput time. The ratio of improvement from flexibility is shown to be amazingly large by using heavy traffic ap-proximation. We also considered the set-up time loss due to flexibility and derived the appropriate range for flexibility and set-up time. The result of this paper implies that we should consider the alternative of introducing flexibility to a processing system {{rather than trying to}} optimally allocate each segments of jobs and get a balanced <b>processing</b> <b>line.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{new idea}} {{in this paper}} is to make a <b>processing</b> <b>line</b> capable of {{reprocessing}} pieces that have not passed the quality test. The focus is to provide a model of the <b>processing</b> <b>line</b> and to introduce in the process a wheeled mobile robot (WMR) equipped with a robotic manipulator (RM) in order to transport pieces, for reprocessing. For this purpose, an processing/reprocessing mechatronics line (P/RML) and a timed hybrid Petri nets (THPN) model will be used in modeling and control of the mechatronics line, with a fixed number of workstations, served by a WMR equipped with (RM). The THPN model is a hybrid type, where P/RML is the discrete part and WMR with RM is the continuous part. The reprocessing starts after the piece fails the quality test. The WMR with RM is used only at the start of reprocessing, in order to transport the pieces from the warehouse {{to the beginning of the}} <b>processing</b> <b>line...</b>|$|E
