5|$|During {{his stay}} Lissitzky also {{developed}} {{his career as}} a graphic designer with some historically important works such as the books Dlia Golossa (For the Voice), a collection of poems from Vladimir Mayakovsky, and Die Kunstismen (The Artisms) together with Jean Arp. In Berlin he also met and befriended many other artists, most notably Kurt Schwitters, László Moholy-Nagy, and Theo van Doesburg. Together with Schwitters and van Doesburg, Lissitzky presented the idea of an international artistic movement under the guidelines of constructivism while also working with Kurt Schwitters on the issue Nasci (Nature) of the periodical Merz, and continuing to illustrate children's books. The year after the publication of his first Proun series in Moscow in 1921, Schwitters introduced Lissitzky to the Hanover gallery kestnergesellschaft, where he held his first solo exhibition. The second Proun series, printed in Hanover in 1923, was a success, utilizing new <b>printing</b> <b>techniques.</b> Later on, he met Sophie Kuppers, who was the widow of Paul Kuppers, an art director of the kestnergesellschaft at which Lissitzky was showing, and whom he would marry in 1927.|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{birds have}} {{appeared}} in books illustrated by some exceptional artists, producing images that were accurate and beautiful, and that made use of the latest available <b>printing</b> <b>techniques.</b> The wood engraver Thomas Bewick's 1797–1804 A History of British Birds brought affordable illustrations {{to the public for}} the first time, and the book formed in effect the first field guide to birds, while John James Audubon's enormous and impressive images of birds in his 1827–1838 Birds of America are among the most admired by art critics and by collectors: early editions fetch among the highest prices paid for any printed books. The ornithologist John Gould's bird illustrations, in books such as A Century of Birds hitherto unfigured from the Himalaya Mountains (1830–1833) with 80 plates, and his 7-volume The Birds of Australia (1840–1848) with 600 plates, related directly to his research, were both beautiful and scientifically useful.|$|E

5|$|Woodblock printing: The {{earliest}} {{specimen of}} woodblock printing is a single-sheet dharani sutra in Sanskrit that was printed on hemp paper between 650 and 670 AD; it was unearthed in 1974 from a Tang tomb near Xi'an. A Korean miniature dharani Buddhist sutra discovered in 1966, bearing extinct Chinese writing characters used {{only during the}} reign of China's only self-ruling empress, Wu Zetian (r.690–705), is dated no earlier than 704 and preserved in a Silla Korean temple stupa built in 751. The first printed periodical, the Kaiyuan Za Bao was made available in AD 713. However, the earliest known book printed at regular size is the Diamond Sutra made during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), a 5.18m (17ft) long scroll which bears the date 868 AD. Joseph Needham and Tsien Tsuen-hsuin write that the cutting and <b>printing</b> <b>techniques</b> used for the delicate calligraphy of the Diamond Sutra book are much more advanced and refined than the miniature dharani sutra printed earlier.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, {{there have}} been two main <b>{{printing}}</b> <b>techniques</b> in Asia: woodblock printing (xylography) and moveable type printing. In the woodblock technique, ink is applied to letters carved upon a wooden board, which is then pressed onto paper. With moveable type, the board is assembled using different lettertypes, according to the page being printed. Wooden printing was used in the East from the 8th century onwards, and moveable metal type came into use during the 12th century.|$|E
25|$|Decades {{into the}} desktop {{publishing}} revolution, few typographers with metal foundry type experience are still working, and few digital typefaces are optimized specifically for different sizes, so {{the misuse of}} the term display typeface as a synonym for ornamental type has become widespread; properly speaking, ornamental typefaces are a subcategory of display typefaces. At the same time, with new <b>printing</b> <b>techniques,</b> typefaces have largely replaced hand-lettering for very large signs and notices that would once have been painted or carved by hand.|$|E
25|$|Art {{history as}} we know it in the 21st century began in the 19th century but has {{precedents}} that date to the ancient world. Like the analysis of historical trends in politics, literature, and the sciences, the discipline benefits from the clarity and portability of the written word, but art historians also rely on formal analysis, semiotics, psychoanalysis and iconography. Advances in photographic reproduction and <b>printing</b> <b>techniques</b> after World War II increased the ability of reproductions of artworks. Such technologies have helped to advance the discipline in profound ways, as they have enabled easy comparisons of objects. The study of visual art thus described, can be a practice that involves understanding context, form, and social significance.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in 1978 with The Pickwick Papers, Keeping took on {{the mammoth}} task of {{illustrating}} the complete works of Charles Dickens for the Folio Society. His knowledge of the vanishing world of industrial London made him the perfect man for the job. The books were originally to be produced by letterpress printing, meaning the illustrations must be pure line drawings with no tones or washes. When they came to be published more modern <b>printing</b> <b>techniques</b> were used which would have allowed Keeping {{a full range of}} tones, but he had started with line drawings, so he used the same technique for the entire series, illustrating two books a year until he completed the task with Martin Chuzzlewit in 1988.|$|E
25|$|The generations who led {{and fought}} the American Civil War were born into an {{independent}} United States {{and they would}} determine whether it could continue as a united republic. Steam power on land and sea had begun to shrink {{the world and the}} telegraph moved information at the speed of electricity. In 1851, Congress reduced rates for typical uses such as printed matter to one cent, and three-cent letter postage versus five or ten-cent rates. Postal distances for each rate were extended as much as ten times, for example, from three hundred to 3,000 miles. Their world was filled with mechanized innovations that included the first U.S. postage stamps produced from machine perforation to replace the cutting tasks which had been done manually. These were accompanied by innovations in paper types and <b>printing</b> <b>techniques.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hedley {{returned}} to 19 Company once {{the war was}} over, and remained with them until 1903, and he continued in surveying duties with the Ordnance Survey until 1906. He was then appointed as an advisor to the Survey of India in order to modernise map production methods, following efforts by the previous Viceroy of India, George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston, and to reform the Survey. Although Hedley faced some resistance to the proposals he made, he was ultimately successful in achieving reform and the Geodetic & Research Branch of the Survey of India still holds in its archives, Notes on the organization, methods and process of the photo-litho office, Calcutta by Major W.C Hedley.

25|$|During {{this same}} year White and Stieglitz {{undertook}} an artistic experiment {{in which they}} jointly created a series of photographs of two models, Mabel Cramer and another known only as Miss Thompson. Stieglitz offered suggestions about posing the models, White focused the camera, and {{one or the other}} of them would snap the shutter. White also developed the negatives and printed the photographs. One of the intentions of the experiment was to try a variety of <b>printing</b> <b>techniques</b> and papers, including platinum, gelatin silver and gum bichromate prints. On a few signed of the prints they signed with a monogram that combined both of their initials. During this collaboration, White learned the Autochrome color process from Stieglitz, who had just returned from Europe with this technical knowledge. White and Stieglitz jointly created at least one Autochrome during this time, which they exhibited later in the year.|$|E

25|$|In 1896, Frank Munsey had {{converted}} his juvenile magazine The Argosy into {{a fiction}} magazine for adults, {{the first of}} the pulp magazines. By the turn of the century, new high-speed <b>printing</b> <b>techniques</b> combined with cheaper pulp paper allowed him to drop the price from twenty-five cents to ten cents, and sales of the magazine took off. In 1910 Street and Smith converted two of their nickel weeklies, New Tip Top Weekly and Top Notch Magazine, into pulps; in 1915, Nick Carter Stories, itself a replacement for the New Nick Carter Weekly, became Detective Story Magazine, and in 1919, New Buffalo Bill Weekly became Western Story Magazine. Harry Wolff, the successor in interest to the Frank Tousey titles, continued to reprint many of them into the mid-1920s, most notably Secret Service, Pluck and Luck, Fame and Fortune and Wild West Weekly. These two series were purchased by Street & Smith in 1926 and converted into pulp magazines the following year, effectively ending the era of the dime novel.|$|E
