50|$|Gymnothorax pictus, {{the painted}} moray, paintspotted moray or <b>peppered</b> <b>moray,</b> is a moray eel. The Chamorro {{name of the}} eel is t√≠tugi.|$|E
50|$|Uropterygius polystictus is a moray eel {{found in}} coral reefs around Mexico and the Galapagos Islands. It is {{commonly}} known as the many-spotted moray, or the <b>peppered</b> <b>moray.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>peppered</b> <b>moray</b> can {{commonly}} {{be found}} in tropical marine waters of the Indo-Pacific and from islands of the tropical Eastern Pacific. They can also {{be found in}} very shallow water on reef flats. Places where the species has been found include Suva Reef, the Fiji Islands, Clarion Island, and the Revillagigedo Islands.|$|E
5000|$|The {{species is}} pale with purplish speckles, which gather {{together}} with age. Young {{of the species}} have no spots or bars; they are pale purplish with white bellies. Its maximum length is 140 cm. The <b>peppered</b> <b>moray</b> eats small fish and crustaceans. G. pictus is similar to [...] Gymnothorax griseus. While hunting for prey, they may be {{completely out of the}} water or may leap out of water. It is dangerous to eat because it is poisonous.|$|E
50|$|The <b>peppered</b> <b>moray</b> {{was named}} and {{described}} by Solander in an unpublished manuscript. Richardson said the fish might be Muraena siderea. Richardson later proved {{the fish was}} different by pointing out the difference in coloration. When the names were published as separate species, it was unknown if they were really different species. Kuep gave the species name as Sidera pantherina. Blecker later changed it to its current name. The reason why the name {{is still the same}} is because of all three people's work.|$|E
