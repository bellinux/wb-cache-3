This result {{is consistent with a}} growing body of research for other regions of the world. The main policy implications are that (1) creditor rights legislation should be reinforced, the law reformed, and efficient property registries established; and (2) governments should sponsor credit bureaus where private bureaus might not be commercially viable.

40|$|Includes bibliographyThe banking sector {{reforms that}} the {{countries}} of Latin America undertook in the 1990 s were an important step forward, but proved insufficient. Although {{it is true that}} the region as a whole progressed significantly, particularly in reducing the role of the State, and that market mechanisms and the regulatory framework in which banking institutions operated were improved, while at the same time the presence of foreign operators increased, it is no less true that most of the Latin American countries continued to experience systemic crises or severe banking instability. This shows that there are still issues that need to be addressed before the region can have a sound banking sector. They include in particular the need to do more to increase the real independence of supervisory bodies by separating bank supervision from short-term economic and <b>political</b> decision-making. Bank <b>supervision</b> needs to be regarded as a matter of State, which means giving priority to its technical and professional aspects; to overcome the difficulties involved, it is essential that there be a real political will to carry through the changes that are required. This article highlights the need to deal with some structural issues, such as the supervision of financial conglomerates, excessive market concentration among a few institutions nationally and region-wide, and the relationship between this and the safety nets which are supposed to contain systemic crises, but which are unable to do so adequately. As regards the regulatory aspects, this paper argues that transparency and market rules in general need to be improved, as do mechanisms for evaluating portfolio and related-party credit risk, especially where effective application of existing rules is concerned...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} thought that Soviet society was characterised by a {{phenomenon}} that only the truth sanctioned by the authorities was talked about in public, even in cases when the real, diametrically opposite truth was actually known. Such dualism and duplicity were also characteristics of Soviet journalism. For example, Peeter Vihalemm and Marju Lauristin (2004) have drawn attention to ambivalence {{as one of the}} characteristic features of Soviet Estonian journalism: on the one hand, it {{was a part of the}} totalitarian ideology and propaganda system, but on the other hand, it was a bearer of the cultural sphere, cultural identity and opposition. However, according to the Marxist-Leninist canons, journalism was only a means for achieving the political and ideological goals of the Communist Party. Therefore, from the time it was founded, Eesti Televisioon (ETV) (Estonian Television Company) was highly controlled by the party. ETV was granted the status of an ‘ideology institution’ and the party treated TV journalists as ideology workers. Consequently, the requirements for them were high, e. g., they had to have the ability to “evaluate social phenomena from Marxist-Leninist viewpoints” and the skill to defend this ideology and to expose hostile ideologies. Hagi Shein, having researched the history of ETV (2004), has argued that journalists could express themselves more freely on apolitical areas of TV programmes, and although self-censorship was strong, they learned to make use of different situations, to balance on the edge between the allowed and the prohibited, to deceive the censors, and to use different contexts. The author of this article researched the minutes and records of the party meetings of the Teleradio Committee of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic and ETV to find the double standards of Communists working at ETV. The period under examination started with the year 1968 when events in Czechoslovakia caused the strengthening of controls over the Soviet media system, and ended with the year 1988 after a few years of perestroika and glasnost policies. It would be misleading to think that there were no true Communists at ETV. However, the article concludes that the ETV party sub-organisation was by no means composed of only committed and principled Communists who absolutely obeyed those positioned higher in the party hierarchy. Rather, the Communists tried to do as little party work as was barely necessary. This was the mentality that could have reduced their presentations, discussions, decisions, plans and reports to an empty formality. A party organisation that was internally weak and two-faced could not effectively assure the realisation of expectations and tasks, such as ideological <b>supervision,</b> <b>political</b> educational work or control over carrying out decisions made by party leaders. This, in its turn, created favourable conditions for preserving cultural identity and for opposition. We can conclude that ETV did not justify its status as a Soviet ideological institution, at least not in those categories that the Communist Party required of an organisation that held as important a place in the propaganda system as did ETV. </p...|$|R

So Stiles and his trustees had to bring political authorities back into management of the College by adding the governor, lieutenant governor, and six senior assistants to the Fellows of the Corporation in return for some monies and for the confirmation of the colonial charter. So, whatever the traditions or later assumptions, Yale College would not find itself operationally free from <b>political</b> <b>supervision</b> until 1872, when by law six alumni fellows or trustees were allowed to be substituted for the six senior senators of the Corporation.|$|E

40|$|The {{establishment}} of the Museum of the Chinese Revolution, which opened its doors in Beijing's Tiananmen Square on I July 1961, the 40 th anniversary {{of the founding of}} the Chinese Communist Party, was a complicated political and cultural decision {{on the part of the}} Chinese government. The museum was never intended to be an artistic enterprise. Rather, it was conceived as a political institution to serve the interest of the Party. This article argues that the Party was ubiquitous in the building of the museum, exercising tight control through strict institutional means, especially through its Propaganda Department. Museum staff, under the close supervision of senior Party officials, sought to pursue an indigenous path different from the Soviet model. Staff members collected artifacts related to the Chinese Communist Revolution, commissioned historical paintings, arranged displays according to the historical framework stipulated by Mao Zedong, and, most important, struggled to instil in the museum the correct "Red Line," that is, the policy of the CCP under Mao's leadership. The article concludes that the museum was an intricate amalgam of <b>political</b> <b>supervision</b> from the top, official historical interpretations, strategic displays and a reflection of the internal Party struggle. The construction of the museum reflects the attempt by the CCP to control the collective memory of the nation and to monopolize the writing of history...|$|E

The collection of information is a constant in our lives, with the commercial sector profiling {{every aspect of our}} behaviour, from the insurance policies we purchase to the beer we drink. Much of this data is gathered without consumers being aware {{of the extent to which}} their privacy and anonymity are being compromised. Whilst the criminal fraternity may also wish to misuse our personal information for fraud or theft, the motives of the largest agencies collating this data are much less obvious or transparent. A recent series of reports to the European Parliament has identified the emergence of new technologies of political control. Such technology can watch and listen to our every move, this is not fiction, although the key player, the US National Security Agency is the same secretive organisation that features in the movie, 'Enemy of the State'. The technology now exists to industrialise such surveillance procedures, with the NSA base at Menwith Hill (UK) having the capability to tap an estimated 2 million phone calls, faxes and emails per hour.

40|$|The main {{topic of}} the article is the {{political}}. During the study {{it has been found}} tested that political behaviour is the difficult question to analyse as in bio-politics {{there are a lot of}} discussions about genetics and social origins of political behaviour. An integration model of bio-political view of political behaviour has been suggested at the article, which includes both genetics (adaptation, domination and subordination) and social factors (education, socialization, the evolution of consciousness). «Homo Politicus» is genetically related with another biological Wight and this definitely influences his behavior in social and political spheres. For instance, every human being as any social primates has genetic inclination to adaptation, domination, subjugation. In case with «Homo Sapiens» this has a form of genetic and social adaptation, political domination and subjugation. The inclination to the domination from one side and to the subjugation to another side is genetically «imprinted» into the nature of the «Homo Politicus». Particularly this two features lie is the basis of his political behavior. However, it is important to mention that, nevertheless the «Homo Sapiens» shares inclination of social primates for hierarchical social organization at the same time he has developed the following capabilities, which are unique in animal world, such as: language, culture and morale. Thus, ideas and values created by the human being have commenced changing of his behavior in social and political sphere. It is important to underline that in above mentioned dichotomy «genetic – culture/morale» such very core analysis element as human brain is absent. According to this, it is has to be mentioned that we keep in mind that the human brain participates in formation of every act or idea, what is fulfilled in the process of the <b>political</b> <b>supervision</b> of subject of management, as well as in the process of social action of management object. So, the political and social behavior of «Homo Politicus» depends not only on his biological factors, such as inclination to the biological adaptation, creation of hierarchical structure, social and political domination and subjugation, but also on social factors as well, such as language, culture, morale and so on. In this case, the human brain comes out as a center of formation of political behavior and awareness of «Homo Politicus» himself and his actions...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} investigates Hangzhou, {{the capital}} of Southern Song China (1127 - 1279). It explores three interrelated aspects of the city, namely spatial morphology, social practice and social structures of this Chinese city, in relation to its geographical and historical context, and in comparison with other major Chinese imperial capitals, and, at a theoretical level, with a cross-cultural discussion concerning social realms or spheres where Western theories are critically engaged. The aim {{of this research is}} to explore a unique Chinese urban tradition, as found in Hangzhou, by crossing different disciplines (architecture, urban history, social studies) and different cultural traditions (Chinese and European). It is hoped that specific aspects of a unique Chinese urban tradition are identified, which includes a tradition specific to China and different from that in Europe. It is hoped that such a discovery may lead to critical and constructive discussions, and may provide inspiring ideas for today's urban design practice and socio-political debate in a cross-cultural environment. The hypothesis of this research is that a 'third realm', one related to but different from Jurgen Habermas' concepts, a realm where state agencies and social groups interacted closely in an organic and relational manner, has made its definite appearance in the city of Hangzhou of Southern Song China. This hypothesis is tested in three areas of social space (marketplaces, landscape sites and temple compounds), with a close examination of their characteristics and their representative cases defined spatially as locales (sites and lines between sites) and temporally as processes (events and festivals unfolding on and across locales). The investigation on spatial morphology reveals that, different from the two established spatial patterns (Skinner's bi-nuclear urban structure and Zhu's multi-level hierarchical composition) identified on Chinese imperial capitals, Hangzhou's spatial morphology can be concluded as having a four-juxtaposed-zone urban structure which is less compartmentalized and less hierarchical. This spatial configuration did not consolidate a 'steep' imperial socio-political order for an absolute authority, but rather fostered the city of Hangzhou to become a prosperous metropolis with advantages for urbanization and commercialization. The investigation on social practice reveals that Hangzhou was planned and governed with a compromised Confucianism and a pragmatic realism of the imperial authority, a situation which gave a huge room for the participation of local social groups and communities under a <b>political</b> <b>supervision</b> that was relatively open and accommodating. A 'space of society' is found, and it accommodated not only a collaborative relationship between imperial government and local population but also an intermediate realm where people of various social groups came into encounter and interaction with less restriction of formalities. The investigation on social structures reveals that various changes of the Song had resulted in the formation of three distinctive social groups (occupational associations, the scholar-official literati, and the religious clergy), who were the main forces in the making of realms of social space as well as users or occupants of these realms. Being formed into various groups, they had on the one hand led or participated in local urban and related affairs with degrees of freedom, and, on the other hand, worked for the government as 'unsalaried state agents' submissive to it leadership. Based on these findings, this thesis argues that a third realm had made its emergence in the city of Hangzhou of Southern Song China. It was found in certain zones and domains in which state government and social realms overlapped where a mediated and relaxed state-society relationship established and developed. Standing as an alternative paradigm, being different from the better-studied and well-established prototypes of northern cities such as that of Beijing, the space of the third realm of Hangzhou is providing suggestions of a 'third way' in political governance and a 'third way' of urbanization, which are arguably more relevant for today's practice.

40|$|Venice is a {{less obvious}} place than it seems. However, its {{multiple}} identities, including the one of creative city, tend to be obscured by the powerful image – almost a caricature – it has acquired during the last century. Venice {{is one of the}} most famous cities in the world, celebrated as a shrine of human creativity. Its unique monumental and cultural heritage has entitled it to be listed, in its entirety along with its lagoon, as World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The image of the city that is most well known is the one of a fragile urban environment built on a group of 118 small islands separated by canals and linked by bridges. However, the city of Venice is more than an agglomeration of islands. Looking at the number of people residing in the municipality of Venice in 2012 (269. 743 people) only 1 / 5 of the population (58. 682 people) lives in the historic city built on water, while around 3 / 5 of residents (176. 000 people) lives in the mainland, mostly in the large urban districts of Mestre and Marghera. From this point of view, the actual Venice only partially corresponds to the romantic image of the decadent city that made its fortunes worldwide. It is rather configured as a “bipolar city". On one side the ancient urban core, site of political and cultural power, where regional and local administrative offices, universities, international cultural institutes, and visitors' attractions are located. On the other side of the long bridge connecting it to the mainland there is the modern city – Mestre and Marghera – that, after Second World War, grew into a very dense urban agglomeration made up of industrial (Marghera) and residential (Mestre) areas. This spatial divide is also visible in the economy of the city of Venice that ranges from mass cultural tourism to petrochemical industries and glass handcrafting, as much as in the composition of the population. Venice is a shrinking city; it sees a constant decrease in number of residents paralleled by an increasing number of city users (communities of tourists, commuters, students, etc. that make up around 25 - 30. 000 presences per day) in the historical city centre and large immigrants communities settled in Mestre and Marghera. In the last decades of the XX century the gap between the monumental, historical Venice and the mainland seems to increasingly be reduced by the current switch of Mestre and Marghera from an extensive production model to a development model of service-based economy. On the other side the historical city of Venice seems to have reached that time in which its economic, social and environmental sustainability is jeopardized by the disneyfication that exploits the city leaving little out for traditional and original productions and markets. Calls multiply both nationally and internationally for Venice to rethink its identity and struck a new balance between the historic city centre and the post-industrial mainland. One of the specificities of the city is precisely this: it attracts attention from all over the world and a variety of institution try to intervene more or less explicitly on its governance. Debates and public projects on the “safeguard” of Venice can be traced back to November 1966, when an exceptional high tide submerged the city causing the worst flood known in its history. The natural disaster was followed by intense debates in the national and international media, within the scientific community, supranational organisations like the UNESCO, civil society organisations and the national parliament. Since 1973, when Venice was declared a matter of “prior national interest”, the “safeguard” of the city has been under the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Works, whereas the urban and architectural maintenance of the city have remained largely under the responsibility of the Municipality of Venice. In 1984, a new “special law” for Venice specified that the national government was also entitled to intervene on Venice via a consortium of private engineering and construction companies. To counterbalance the large powers attributed to the Consortium, a special “Committee for Policy Coordination and Control” was created to ensure high-level <b>political</b> <b>supervision</b> on all matters concerning Venice. It is in this complex web of political, economic and cultural interests that the Venice tries to re-invent its future also by looking at creativity as a way of combining different issues: 1. 	Combining the cultural demands of the few city dwellers and of the masses of tourists; 2. 	Maintaining an international outlook as a global city while preserving local traditions and symbols; 3. 	Creating new connections between the diverse economies existing in the city to sustain each other’s in a virtuous economic cycle. Whether the conceptualisation of contemporary Venice as creative city can provide an answer the above is still be seen. What is indeed an obligatory passage point is the consideration of Venice as a city that built much of its economic power and cultural supremacy on various expressions of creativity across centuries...|$|E
