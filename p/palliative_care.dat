5|$|Along with {{offering}} {{emotional support}} {{to both the}} patient and family, <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> serves {{an important role in}} addressing goals of care. People with Parkinson's may have many difficult decisions to make as the disease progresses such as wishes for feeding tube, non-invasive ventilator, and tracheostomy; wishes for or against cardiopulmonary resuscitation; and when to use hospice care. <b>Palliative</b> <b>care</b> team members can help answer questions and guide people with Parkinson's on these complex and emotional topics to help them make the best decision based on their own values.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{faith and}} spirituality in <b>palliative</b> <b>cares</b> {{started to be}} used in medical {{community}} in {{the last decade of the}} XX century. The faith is known as a synonym of trust and hope being considered a positive emotion which helps the individual to enlarge tolerance, moral, growing creativity and building of new expectations. And the spirituality is related to psychological experiences of religiousness, as-sociated individual idea. Such themes are inserted in the assistance to the palliative cancer patient. Objective: Evaluate current evidences related to faith themes and spirituality when used in <b>palliative</b> <b>cares</b> and its effects facing the life quality of these patients, aiming to systematize them. Method: Talks about a systematic qualitative review of faith and spirituality themes, whereas makes it possible to summarize researches already concluded and obtain conclusions from a theme of interest...|$|R

5|$|The risk of {{developing}} pancreatic cancer is lower among non-smokers, and people who maintain a healthy weight and limit their consumption of red or processed meat. A smoker's chance {{of developing}} the disease decreases if they stop smoking, and almost returns {{to that of the}} rest of the population after 20years. Pancreatic cancer can be treated with surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, <b>palliative</b> <b>care,</b> or a combination of these. Treatment options are partly based on the cancer stage. Surgery is the only treatment that can cure pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and may also be done to improve quality of life without the potential for cure. Pain management and medications to improve digestion are sometimes needed. Early <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> is recommended even for those receiving treatment that aims for a cure.|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{the current}} study was to {{investigate}} nurses’ experiences of <b>caring</b> for <b>palliative</b> patients in <b>palliative</b> home <b>care,</b> and to examine the coping strategies they use. Method: The study was empirical descriptive with qualitative approach. The data was collected by nine semi-structured interviews and analyzed by using manifest content analysis. Result: By analysing data three categories: Positive experiences of <b>palliative</b> home <b>care,</b> Stressful experiences of <b>palliative</b> home <b>care</b> and Problem-focused coping strategies, and 15 subcategories, were distinguished. Conclusion: Experiences of <b>palliative</b> home <b>care</b> were both of positive and challenging characters. Stressful situations were managed by problem-focused coping strategies. Nurses are in need of the work situation at home to become more ergonomic and designed to protect the nurse’s physical wellbeing. The present study was of a too small character to be transferable, thus similar studies on a larger scale are required in the future...|$|R

40|$|Terminal {{cancer and}} other severe deseases do not only affect the patient bur also the whole family. Terminally ill {{patients}} often choose {{to spend as much}} of their time as possible at home, thus involving family members in the care process. This book is a mother's story about the <b>palliative</b> home <b>care</b> of her dying adult son, also a father to a three-year-old daughter. The son was cared for at home while dying from leiomyosarcoma. The <b>palliative</b> home <b>care</b> and the mother's grief and bereavement are described i four stories: Hopa and disavowal versus fear and despair, Communication in action between famiy caregivers and a <b>palliative</b> home <b>care</b> team, Words that make a difference in grief and bereavement and Communication across generations. The stories are interpreted and analyzed. Trust, flexibiity, continuity, accessibility and empowerment were key concepts in the communication between the family caregivers and the <b>palliative</b> home <b>care</b> team. Emapthy based on institutions, on compassion, on shared experiences and loss, but also empathy to self, contributed to the mother's reconciliation...|$|R

5|$|<b>Palliative</b> <b>care</b> is {{specialized}} {{medical care}} for people with serious illnesses, including Parkinson's. The goal of this speciality is to improve {{quality of life for}} both the person suffering from Parkinson's and the family by providing relief from the symptoms, pain, and stress of illnesses. As Parkinson's is not a curable disease, all treatments are focused on slowing decline and improving quality of life, and are therefore palliative in nature.|$|E

5|$|Chemotherapy may be {{combined}} with <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> {{in the treatment of}} the NSCLC. In advanced cases, appropriate chemotherapy improves average survival over supportive care alone, as well as improving quality of life. With adequate physical fitness maintaining chemotherapy during lung cancer palliation offers 1.5 to 3 months of prolongation of survival, symptomatic relief, and an improvement in quality of life, with better results seen with modern agents. The NSCLC Meta-Analyses Collaborative Group recommends if the recipient wants and can tolerate treatment, then chemotherapy should be considered in advanced NSCLC.|$|E
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is {{considered}} to be an incurable and rapidly lethal cancer unless both the primary tumor and any metastases can be fully removed by surgery. No potentially curative treatment exists except surgery, but most people have advanced stage disease at presentation and are inoperable at the time of diagnosis. People with cholangiocarcinoma are generally managed - though not cured - with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and other <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> measures. These are also used as additional therapies after surgery in cases where resection has apparently been successful (or nearly so).|$|E
40|$|Purpose The {{recruitment}} of participants to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in <b>palliative</b> cancer <b>care</b> by {{health care professionals}} is often unsuccessful, which could result in failure to achieve study power. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to describe how health care professionals experienced recruiting patients and family caregivers to an RCT in <b>palliative</b> cancer <b>care.</b> Methods The study had a qualitative explorative design. Ten <b>palliative</b> home <b>care</b> settings were involved in the RCT and data were generated through focus group discussions and interviews with health care professionals who were responsible for the recruitment. The transcripts were analyzed with interpretive descriptive principles. Results The experiences of the health care professionals reveal that communicating the RCT-design to patients and family caregivers was a challenging part of the recruitment but was considered a process of learning over time. The delicate situation that participants were living under added to the challenge and health care professionals believed that the randomized design was contrary to their normal approach to always offer the best possible support. Conclusions The results contribute valuable knowledge for future trials in <b>palliative</b> cancer <b>care.</b> To promote successful recruitment, health care professionals may be in need of more training to improve their communication skills and it may be necessary to consider other research designs than the RCT...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} {{a study of the}} place of {{research}} on supportive, <b>palliative</b> and end-of-life <b>care</b> within the United Kingdom Research Assessment Exercise of 2001 and 2008. Sixty-seven Higher Education Institutions in 2001 and 66 in 2008 contributed work to the Research Assessment Exercise relevant to supportive, <b>palliative</b> and end-of-life <b>care.</b> This comprised 16 subject areas in 2001 and 25 in 2008, and was generated by 178 authors in 2001 and 176 authors in 2008. Seven ‘high-intensity groups’ of concentrated research activity were identified in 2001, and eight such groups in 2008. Between the years little growth occurred in contributions to the Research Assessment Exercise relating to supportive, <b>palliative</b> and end-of-life <b>care,</b> and the ‘high-intensity groups’ remain relatively fragile. With one exception, there is no concentration of effort in clinical studies relating to the medical aspects of supportive, <b>palliative</b> and end-of-life <b>care.</b> By 2008 there were still less than 40 university academics in the UK with major commitments to research in supportive, <b>palliative</b> and end-of-life <b>care,</b> as measured by their Research Assessment Exercise participation...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{critically}} examine gender relations in the sociopolitical context of hospice <b>palliative</b> home <b>care</b> for clients with cancer and their family caregivers. Using a critical feminist lens, I employed critical ethnography as a methodology to uncover taken-for-granted attitudes, beliefs, and practices that shape health and health care experiences within the culture of end-of-life at home. The study addressed the following research questions: (a) How do gender relations shape health and health care experiences within the socio-political context of hospice <b>palliative</b> home <b>care</b> for clients with cancer and their caregivers?; (b) How do gendered processes operate to produce gender relations and potential gender inequities in this context?; and (c) What are the social mechanisms and consequences that (re) produce gender (in) equities in hospice <b>palliative</b> home <b>care?</b> Purposeful sampling was used to gather information-rich data from six triads consisting of a client with cancer, his/her family caregiver and primary nurse. I employed ethnographic methods of interview, observation, and document review to gain in-depth knowledge of the patterns and dynamics of gender relations. Twenty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted with clients, family caregivers, and nurses. Observations of nine home visits by the nurse contextualized gender social relations in this setting. Program, professional, and public communication documents were analyzed to understand how institutional discourses shaped gendered attitudes, beliefs, and practices and everyday health and health care experiences in hospice <b>palliative</b> home <b>care.</b> A gender-based analysis revealed that institutional discourses influenced Gendered Expectations and Exemptions, disadvantaging both men and women in this context. Ideological gendered processes of Normalizing Gender Relations and Equalizing Gender Relations supported the everyday practices of Regulating Gender Relations. Finally, socially constructed mechanisms of Preservation/Destruction of Gender Stereotypes and Imbalance/Balance of Power (re) produced gender (in) equities. Overall, gender relations and gender inequities were considered low in priority and status within the culture of hospice <b>palliative</b> home <b>care.</b> Recommendations have been made related to policy, practice, education, and research...|$|R

5|$|Hospice is a {{competitive}} business. In any given service area, {{there may be}} hundreds of different non-profit and commercial providers. Hospices can be small community-based operations, part of regional and national corporations, or part of a hospital or other health system. Data from the National Hospice and <b>Palliative</b> <b>Care</b> Organization indicated that in 2008 58.3% of hospice agencies were independent, with 20.8% based in hospitals, 19.7% geared for home health care and 1.3% in conjunction with nursing homes. In 2007, {{the mean number of}} patients being treated in hospice facilities on any given day was 90.2. 79.4% of hospice providers admitted fewer than 500 patients per year. The number of for-profit and non-profit providers has become more balanced as the for-profit sector has grown. In 2007, 47.1% of agencies were for-profit, with 48.6% non-profit. The remaining 4.3% were government-owned providers.|$|E
5|$|Since then, {{the hospice}} {{industry}} has rapidly expanded. This growth has accompanied the AIDS epidemic and {{the aging of}} the population, with related illnesses. By 1995, hospices were a $2.8 billion industry, with $1.9 billion from Medicare alone funding patients in 1,857 hospice programs with Medicare certification. In that year, 72% of hospice providers were non-profit. By 1998, there were 3,200 hospices either in operation or under development throughout the United States and Puerto Rico, according to the National Hospice and <b>Palliative</b> <b>Care</b> Organization (NHPCO). According to 2007's Last Rights: Rescuing the End of Life from the Medical System, hospice sites are expanding at a national rate of about 3.5% per year. In 2007, 1.4 million people in the United States used hospice, with more than one-third of dying Americans using the service, approximately 39%.
