25|$|Nevertheless, new {{and rebuilt}} {{locomotives}} {{arrived on the}} property in gleaming blue and white to replace some of the tired, filthy <b>power.</b> <b>Track</b> rebuild projects covered the system. Main lines that had seen little or no maintenance in years were pulled from the mud. Rail and tie replacement programs attacked the maintenance backlog. However, the FRA-backed loans that Ingram sought were thwarted by the lobbying efforts of competing railroads, who considered a healthy Rock Island as a threat. By 1978, main line track improved in quality. For example, {{at the end of}} that summer, the Illinois Division had no slow orders: freight velocity was rising. The sale of the Golden State Route to the Southern Pacific had been agreed to. The Rock Island slowly inched towards a financial break-even point, despite the financial malaise that plagued the late 1970s.|$|E

This result shows the similarity of three vary different approaches to this simultaneous implementation, leading to more effective combined energy storage plus attitude control subsystems...|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} a new operating scheme for variable speed wind/tidal stream turbines employing synchronous generators. Current maximum <b>power</b> <b>tracking</b> schemes for variable speed wind energy conversion systems rely on periodic {{comparison of the}} output power for guiding the direction of maximum <b>power</b> <b>tracking</b> or an online algorithm which continuously provides a generator torque/speed reference corresponding to the maximum power status at different wind speed conditions. The proposed scheme utilises only one-power-point on the maximum power curve. Once the information for the maximum power status of a local wind speed is known, then the wind energy conversion system implements maximum <b>power</b> <b>tracking</b> and constant <b>power</b> control for different wind speed conditions using simple control. The operation strategy is applicable to tidal stream turbines. Simulation results demonstrate the concept...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. PV (Photovoltaic) {{generation}} output with MPPT (Maximum <b>power</b> point <b>tracking)</b> is unadjustable. In this paper, PV {{generation is}} expected to regulate grid frequency. Thus a <b>power</b> <b>tracking</b> control strategy based on feedback frequency instead of MPPT is put forward. The feedback frequency is transferred to controlling unit of DC-DC inverter. The DC bus voltage is adjusted by controlling the duty cycle of DC-DC invertor. A grid-connected PV system with a <b>power</b> <b>tracking</b> control strategy based on feedback frequency and a DC-AC inverter control module are built in MATLAB-Simulink platform. Experiment result indicates that PV generation could regulate grid frequency by the control strategy based on feedback frequency...|$|R
