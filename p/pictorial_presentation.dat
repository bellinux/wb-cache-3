60|$|Dickens's {{greatest}} gift was characterization, and no English writer, save Shakespeare, has drawn so many and so varied characters. It {{would be as}} absurd to interpret all of these as caricatures as to deny Dickens his great and varied powers of creation. Dickens exaggerated many of his comic and satirical characters, as was his right, for caricature and satire are very closely related, while exaggeration is {{the very essence of}} comedy. But there remains a host of characters marked by humour and pathos. Yet the <b>pictorial</b> <b>presentation</b> of Dickens's characters has ever tended toward the grotesque. The interpretations in this volume aim to eliminate the grosser phases of the caricature in favour of the more human. If the interpretations seem novel, if Scrooge be not as he has been pictured, it is because a more human Scrooge was desired--a Scrooge not wholly bad, a Scrooge of a better heart, a Scrooge to whom the resurrection described in this story was possible. It has been the illustrator's whole aim to make these people live in some form more fully consistent with their types.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [52]- 54) The {{main and}} only function of Byzantine religious art was {{to express the}} teachings of Christian Orthodoxy to its worshippers.

Beginning in the third century A. D., and relying on the Graeco-Roman models, Byzantine religious art soon assumed a distinct artistic and iconographic character of its own. Seriousness, somberness, and dignity, as one would expect, had always been the major features of this art. However, in spite of this tradition which also required that holy images be placed above earthly matters, Byzantine art never completely lost touch with humanity. The humanistic elements became very distinct in the Middle Period (843 - 1204) and continued until the final collapse of the Empire in 1453. M. A. (Master of Arts...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study, {{nested within}} a large cohort study, {{sought to explore}} how well Vietnamese mothers with pre-school {{children}} understood the dental health education material commonly available in New South Wales, Australia. Design: Qualitative research. Setting: Home-based interviews. Method: Vietnamese-speaking mothers (n = 24) with young children were provided with two dental leaflets which gave advice on health behaviours in English and Vietnamese for comparison. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using a thematic coding. Results: Mothers generally reported that the English leaflets were difficult to read due to their lower levels of English literacy skills. Although the mothers preferred leaflets in their native language, they noted {{that it did not}} completely reflect the Vietnamese culture. Mothers recommended <b>pictorial</b> <b>presentations</b> for immigrants to improve understanding. Conclusions: The consistency of our findings suggest that health education leaflets should be provided to parents in their first language with use of illustrations to improve understanding, and that producers of health education leaflets should consider cultural differences in translation.

40|$|Mediated facial {{expressions}} do not elicit emotions {{as strongly as}} real-life {{facial expressions}}, possibly due to the low fidelity of <b>pictorial</b> <b>presentations</b> in typical mediation technologies. In the present study, we investigated {{the extent to which}} stereoscopy amplifies emotions elicited by images of neutral, angry, and happy facial expressions. The emotional self-reports of positive and negative valence (which were evaluated separately) and arousal of 40 participants were recorded. The magnitude of perceived depth in the stereoscopic images was manipulated by varying the camera base at 15, 40, 65, 90, and 115 [*]mm. The analyses controlled for participants’ gender, gender match, emotional empathy, and trait alexithymia. The results indicated that stereoscopy significantly amplified the negative valence and arousal elicited by angry expressions at the most natural (65 [*]mm) camera base, whereas stereoscopy amplified the positive valence elicited by happy expressions in both the narrowed and most natural (15 – 65 [*]mm) base conditions. Overall, the results indicate that stereoscopy amplifies the emotions elicited by mediated emotional facial expressions when the depth geometry is close to natural. The findings highlight the sensitivity of the visual system to depth and its effect on emotions...|$|R

40|$|Background.  Early Childhood Caries is a {{significant}} public health issue worldwide. Although much {{is known about the}} aetiology of dental caries, there is limited evidence on the understanding of caregivers on readily available early childhood oral health education materials. Aim. The {{purpose of this study was}} to record how parents cope with dental health education materials for preschool children commonly available in New South Wales, Australia. Design.  This qualitative study was nested within a large cohort study in South Western Sydney. English-speaking mothers (n = 24) with young children were approached for a face-to-face, semi-structured interview at their homes. Two dental leaflets designed by NSW Health to give advice on monitoring young children’s oral health were sent to mothers prior to the interview. Interviews were recorded and subsequently transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were analysed by interview debriefing and a thematic coding. Results. Mothers generally reported that the leaflets were easy to read but noted that the information pertaining to bottle feeding was confusing. Furthermore, they were unable to understand terms such as ‘fluoride’ and ‘fissure sealants’. Early childhood nutrition and infant teething were inadequately addressed, and mothers preferred <b>pictorial</b> <b>presentations</b> to improve their understanding of oral health. Conclusions.  Producers of health education leaflets should keep the messages simple and straightforward, avoid the use of medical jargon, and use pictorial aids to improve communication with parents...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{pictorial}} knowledge representation is demonstrated for {{two examples of}} time series analysis in seismology. The approaches perform a) automated recognition of known event signatures and b) high-resolution onset timing of later phases. Both methods work well under extreme conditions of noise and achieved human-like performance in recognizing known situations. Crucial for this success of pictorial knowledge representation was the design of suitably scaled images. They must be simple and robust enough to transform the complexity of “real life” data into a limited set of patterns. These patterns differ significantly from the initial data; they correspond more closely to the non-linear weighting of recognized impressions by an experienced scientist. Thus the author addresses the <b>pictorial</b> <b>presentations</b> as mental images. For both reported applications, part of their power comes by model-based image modifications. However, this enhancement is far from demanding a complete theory. Any fractional model already enhances the image adaptation, so mental images are best suited to deal with incomplete knowledge like any other artificial intelligence approach. Cognitive plausibility was found for both the non-linear image scalings and the model-based image modifications. In general, the author's method of pictorial knowledge representation conforms {{to the concept of}} mental images by Kosslyn. Any new task will demand the composition of new, dedicated image transformations where some generalized design criteria are derived from the author's applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{landscape}} identity is particularly {{present in the}} view of the current changes in rural land-use patterns, where, as a consequence, the identities of traditional rural societies seem threatened. The problem lies in the perception of spatial identity as a physical phenomenon, while in reality it is an ever evolving relationship. The social conception of the national space is shaped within the processes of communication, and tends inevitably towards uniformity, regardless of its actual geographical diversity. Specific landscapes within national space emerge as representative of the whole, usually appearing as symbolic places or as conceptualized landscape types composed of various and distinct landscape features. Following the survey of historical relations between the generation of national consciousness and space, the research continued with the analysis of <b>pictorial</b> <b>presentations</b> of landscapes in tourist and political advertisments and with a public opinion survey. The results show that national identity is defined not only by symbolic places but also by special landscape types and that the popular conception of national space does not exist as an absolute: It changes in different time periods and adopts various meanings among particular social strata or groups depending on the context of its use. The study confirmed the existence of a motif that is no longer linked to a precisely specified place and thus loses the particularities of a concrete location. No longer linked to a specific geographic location, it assumes the role of the representative of the whole in the conception. Thus the concept in all its forms does not necessarily relate directly to the contemporary physical reality of the environment...|$|R

In general, performance trends predicted by the model were confirmed experimentally. Experimental and analytical results both indicated superiority to the EADI display with respect to regulation of height and airspeed errors. Velocity steering allowed tighter regulation of height errors, but control parameters had little influence on airspeed regulation.

40|$|Four verbal {{implicit}} memory tests, word identification, word stem completion, word fragment completion, and anagram solution, were directly compared in one experiment and were contrasted with free recall. On all implicit tests, priming was greatest from prior visual presentation of words, less (but significant) from auditory presentation, and least from <b>pictorial</b> <b>presentations.</b> Typefont {{did not affect}} priming. In free recall, pictures were recalled better than words. The four implicit tests all largely index perceptual (lexical) operations in recognizing words, or visual word form representations. Implicit memory tests are those in which retention is mea-sured indirectly by having subjects perform some task os-tensibly unrelated to a prior study phase in the experiment (Graf & Schacter, 1985). Retention is indicated when per-formance on studied items exceeds that on similar items not presented in a prior study phase, a phenomenon {{commonly referred to as}} priming. For example, subjects might be ex-posed to a word such as polliwog during the study phase and then later be asked to identify the word from a brief display (a word identification test), to respond with the first word they can think of when provided with the first three letters (a word stem completion test), to complete a word puzzle such as p 1 iwo (a word fragment completion test), or to rearrange presented letters such as olpliwgo to form a word (an anagram solution test). Priming refers to better perfor-mance on studied than on nonstudied words in these tasks. These four {{implicit memory}} tests will be examined in the present research. When subjects are given these sorts of tests, the instruc-tions given to disguise the implicit nature of the tests do not guarantee that subjects will eschew the conscious use of memory in performing the task. However, one reason for suspecting that implicit tests measure something different from standard explicit memory tests such as recall or rec-ognition is that often the two types can be dissociated.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{provision}} of patient information leaflets regarding telehealth has been perceived by potential consumers {{as a strategy}} to promote awareness and adoption of telehealth services. However, such leaflets need to be designed carefully if adoption and awareness among potential users is to be promoted. Therefore, the aims of this study were: first, to see how telehealth was portrayed {{in some of the}} existing telehealth leaflets (THLs). Second, to explore patients' perceptions of the existing THLs and their engagement with the concept and how THLs can be optimised. METHODS: A two-step approach was employed to address the aims of this study. The first phase involved the use of discourse analysis to compare 12 electronically and publically available THLs, with the existing THL guidance "Involve Yorkshire and Humber". The second phase involved conducting 14 semi-structured interviews with potential telehealth users/patients to gauge their perception and engagement with the concept, using the two leaflets that were mostly matching with the guidance used. Six interviews were audio-recorded and eight had detailed jotted notes. The interviews were transcribed and thematically analysed to identify key themes. RESULTS: The discourse analysis showed certain gaps and variations within the screened leaflets when addressing the following aspects: cost of the telehealth service, confidentiality, patients' choices in addition to equipment use and technical support. Analysis of the interviews revealed patients' need for having clear and sufficient information about the telehealth service within the THLs; in addition to, patients' preference for the use of simpler terminologies for telehealth description and the {{provision of}} clear simple texts with <b>pictorial</b> <b>presentations.</b> The interviews also revealed certain limitations against adoption of telehealth by the participants, such as: lack of privacy and confidentiality of information, fear of technology breakdown and equipment failure, loss of face-to-face contact with healthcare professionals and being too dependent on the telehealth service. CONCLUSION: The current study showed a great variation among the screened THLs and highlighted certain gaps within the content and presentation of these leaflets. However, the study also highlighted certain key issues to be considered when designing THLs in the future to enhance telehealth uptake and use by patients...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{uses the}} Nowak and Wärneryd model of {{communication}} campaigns (1985) as the roadmap to present findings from an investigation {{conducted on the}} Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project (LVEMP), co-funded by the World Bank and Global Environment Facility (GEF). LVEMP s major goal is to arrest the environmental problems affecting Lake Victoria and the 30 million {{people who live in}} its basin. LVEMP was launched in 1997 and is being implemented by the three East African countries sharing Lake Victoria (Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda). This study is an investigation of LVEMP-Uganda. The academic impetus to this study is that for development communication approaches to succeed, they ought to be based on principles of planned, and yet participatory communication (Lana, 1989; Nwoku, 1993; Servaes, 1999 / 2; Jacobson and Kolluri, 1999; Dervin and Frenette, 2001). Based on that conviction, this study set out to investigate the basis of claims made by some scholars of development communication accusing the World Bank of being the present-day proponents of the top-down model of development, and its linear approach to communication (White, 1999 : 34; Wilkins and Waters, 2000 : 59). LVEMP provided the best ground for me to investigate those claims since it is a project co-sponsored and co-supervised by the World Bank (LVEMP News Bulletin, Vol. 2 No. 2, June 2002 : 12). Whereas the Nowak and Wärneryd model provides an excellent framework in which to present LVEMP s discernible media and communication strategy, the model is by design linear, inconsistent with the thrust of this study, which is participatory or dialogic communication. In order to assess the participatory nature of LVEMP s media and communication strategy, this study uses Dervin and Frenette s dialogic communication model (2001 : 70 - 85), supplemented by several other scholars in planned participatory communication (Lana, 1989 : 179 - 189; Nwoku, 1993 : 16 - 18; Servaes, 1999 / 2 : 88 - 92). The findings in this study are presented in chapters four and five. In addition to presenting a situational analysis of the major environmental problems affecting the LVB people, chapter four employs mainly in-depth interviews and document analyses to assess {{the extent to which the}} problems affecting the LVB are media and communication related. The rather extensive chapter five uses the models mentioned above to present, analyze and discuss findings from the field. Both chapters are enhanced with graphical and <b>pictorial</b> <b>presentations</b> to enable this thesis tell a more compelling story...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contends that}} knowledge-making is a {{political}} act. In reflecting {{on the nature of}} personal narrative and its uses for refugee research, three insights emerge: first, just as the personal is political, so too, the political is personal; next, any storytelling is political in its attention to audience, and is inflected by the discourses available at the time; and finally, researchers must understand that if storying is to grapple with the richness and complexity of lived experience, it will probably be chaotic and messy, as well as clear and straightforward. Researchers wanting to investigate the sociology of refugee experiences might be well advised to ensure that the stories they gather from research participants are not too neat, too straightforward, too much reduced to bare essentials in their telling, lest the chance to allow the stories to become personally and politically resonant be lost. Further, researchers who are conscious of the political resonance of narrative are advised to ensure that they draw attention to the narrative element embedded in their research reports and papers by finding ways to communicate the narratives directly to the commissioning policy makers and politicians through verbal and <b>pictorial</b> seminar <b>presentations,</b> as well as through the reports themselves. These insights have implications for research processes (the gathering and analysis of data) and for the presentation and writing up of research documents...|$|R

40|$|The {{extent to}} which <b>pictorial</b> <b>presentation</b> would {{facilitate}} the comprehension of text-like passages among two populations of fourth-grade students was investigated. Subjects were 64 students each in high-socioeconomic status (SES) white and low-SES black groups. Simple passages amenable to <b>pictorial</b> <b>presentation</b> were read over a programed tape to the subjects. At the same time slides giving a cumulative presentation were projected. In the verbal conditions they were made from photographs of hand drawings. Subjects were tested individually following each passage. Three main effects were significant: population, presentation mode (text versus pictorial), and question type (1 attribute span question versus 2 to 4 attribute span questions). The data also indicated that visual elaboration was significantly more effective in the low-SES black population. It was the researcher's belief that the question-type effect in the low-SES black population indicated the subjects' attempt to transform the passages by processing them conceptually and that equal performance in the memory and inspection conditions in the pictorial mode confirmed that the pictures aided in this conceptual activity.

40|$|Educators {{frequently}} neglect {{efforts to}} evaluate the affective components of instructional programs even though most agree that the affective domain is as important, or even more important, than the cognitive domain in learning. Measurement of cognitive attainment is easily accomplished, however, measurement of students' feelings, attitudes, concerns and values is difficult to accomplish. The {{purpose of the present}} research was to measure galvanic skin response (GSR) reactions of students to multi-media programs which were created to effect attitude change toward biological concepts in nonscience majors, and to thereby identify learning strategies or combinations of strategies that produce emotional and physiological reactions. The electronic response (ER) system of the Department of Biology at Ball State University was utilized in conducting the study. The effectiveness of producing emotional arousal by the strategies involved in nine ER programs was sampled by using the galvanic skin response (GSR) to measure the change in electrical skin conductance. The population tested for each ER program consisted of 30 subjects. An approximately equal number of males and females and an approximately equal number of morning, mid-day and afternoon sessions were sampled. In the treatment of data, the maximum GSR resistance, following specific ER program events, was calculated using a latency of approximately three seconds. Resistance per unit area of electrode plate surface was calculated in ohms/mm 2 and converted to conductance (mhos/mm 2). To establish a basis for comparing the emotional and attitudinal impact of each electronic response program, the maximum conductance for each event and information components of each event sequence was averaged for the 30 subjects. A dependent t-test for paired observations was utilized to determine the significant conductance change of corresponding components of the initial and final event sequences in each ER program. In those situations which were significant at the. 05 probability level, farther comparisons were made between corresponding components of the initial and middle and middle and final event sequences. The t-test was also utilized to determine the significance of mean changes in conductance between selected information and question and question and answer slides within event sequences which produced a greater or lower conductance than previous event sequences, and those in which little variance or observable differences among components occurred. The principal conclusion drawn from the study is that the electronic response programs provide an effective mechanism for increasing emotional arousal, increasing involvement, and creating attitude change. All of the nine electronic response programs produced a gradual rise in average conductance from the beginning to the end of each program. Extremes in GSR reactions occurred in response to different types and combinations of narrative, <b>pictorial</b> <b>presentations</b> and musicalselections. Situations which created a mood or conveyed a feeling, possessed emotionally toned narrative or slides, or required a value stance or judgment produced the greatest GSR reactions. Calming, quiet, and relaxing music, unmoving slides, unemotional narration, questions lacking challenge or treating non-controversial subject matter, produced the smallest GSR reactions. The present study supports the contention that multiple stimuli, which increase the number of senses incorporated in the learning process and the interaction (response-reinforcement) of the learner, produce a greater emotional reaction than stimuli in one sense modality. The author considers that emotional responses involved and related with affective learning are as important, or more important, than cognitive attainment. Further investigations of the relationship between multimedia components and emotional arousal need to be carried out to ascertain the appropriate blending or combinations of stimuli which provide the best or most effective learning situations. Data obtained through research in the cognitive and affective aspects of instructional designs should also be correlated to determine how the most effective learning strategies can be developed.
