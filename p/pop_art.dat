5|$|Marla F. Prather {{observed}} that Whaam!s grand scale and dramatic depiction contributed to its {{position as a}} historic work of <b>pop</b> <b>art.</b> With As I Opened Fire, Lichtenstein's other monumental war painting, Whaam! {{is regarded as the}} culmination of Lichtenstein's dramatic war-comics works, according to Diane Waldman. It is widely described as either Lichtenstein's most famous work, or, along with Drowning Girl, as one of his two most famous works. Andrew Edgar and Peter Sedgwick describe it, along with Warhol's Marilyn Monroe prints, {{as one of the most}} famous works of <b>pop</b> <b>art.</b> Gianni Versace once linked the two iconic <b>pop</b> <b>art</b> images via his gown designs. According to Douglas Coupland, the World Book Encyclopedia used pictures of Warhol's Monroes and Whaam! to illustrate its <b>Pop</b> <b>art</b> entry.|$|E
5|$|Girl with Ball is a 1961 {{painting}} by Roy Lichtenstein. It is an {{oil on canvas}} <b>Pop</b> <b>art</b> work that {{is now in the}} collection of the Museum of Modern Art, after being owned for several decades by Philip Johnson. It is one of Lichtenstein's earliest <b>Pop</b> <b>art</b> works and is known for its source, which is a newspaper ad that ran for several decades and which was among Lichtenstein's earliest works sourced from pop culture.|$|E
5|$|The Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s {{established}} the African-American literary canon in the United States and introduced writers Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston. Manhattan's vibrant visual art {{scene in the}} 1950s and 1960s was a center of the American <b>pop</b> <b>art</b> movement, which gave birth to such giants as Jasper Johns and Roy Lichtenstein. The downtown <b>pop</b> <b>art</b> movement of the late 1970s included artist Andy Warhol and clubs like Serendipity 3 and Studio 54, where he socialized.|$|E

5|$|Contrasting against Caravaggio's sensual {{baskets of}} fruit, Chardin's plush peaches, or Cézanne's vibrant {{arrangements}} of apples, the mundane Campbell's Soup Cans gave {{the art world}} a chill. Furthermore, the idea of isolating eminently recognizable pop culture items was ridiculous enough to the art world that both the merits and ethics of the work were perfectly reasonable debate topics {{for those who had}} not even seen the piece. Warhol's <b>pop</b> <b>art</b> {{can be seen as a}} relation to Minimal art in the sense that it attempts to portray objects in their most simple, immediately recognizable form. <b>Pop</b> <b>art</b> eliminates overtones and undertones that would otherwise be associated with representations.|$|E
5|$|The Silver Age {{coincided with}} the rise of <b>pop</b> <b>art,</b> an artistic {{movement}} that used popular cultural artifacts, such as advertising and packaging, as source material for fine, or gallery-exhibited, art. Roy Lichtenstein, one of the best-known <b>pop</b> <b>art</b> painters, specifically chose individual panels from comic books and repainted the images, modifying them to some extent in the process but including in the painting word and thought balloons and captions as well as enlarged-to-scale color dots imitating the coloring process then used in newsprint comic books. An exhibition of comic strip art was held at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs of the Palais de Louvre in 1967, and books were soon published that contained serious discussions of the art of comics {{and the nature of the}} medium.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{originality}} and longevity, Winnie Winkle {{became a}} household name and an icon, inspiring even <b>Pop</b> <b>Art</b> artist Roy Lichtenstein. Winnie Winkle was reprinted in Dell Comics, {{and for a time}} her face appeared on a cigar box lid. In retrospect, Winnie Winkle is seen as one of the comic strips heralding a new, more independent role for American women after World War I.|$|E

5000|$|The {{differentiating}} factor, {{according to}} Seehafer, between surrealism and massurrealism {{is the foundation}} of the former in the early 20th century in Europe before the spread of electronic mass media. It is difficult to define the visual style of massurrealism, though a general characteristic is the use of modern technology to fuse surrealism's traditional access to the unconscious with <b>pop</b> <b>art's</b> ironic contradictions.|$|R
5|$|Former MCA Chief Curator Elizabeth Smith {{provided}} {{a narrative of}} the museum's collection. She says the collection has examples of late surrealism, <b>pop</b> <b>art,</b> minimalism, and conceptual art from the 1940s through the 1970s; work from the 1980s that can be grouped under postmodernism; and painting, sculpture, photography, video, installation, and related media current artists explore.|$|E
5|$|Portrait of Madame Cézanne (sometimes Portrait of Mrs. Cézanne) is a 1962 <b>Pop</b> <b>art</b> {{painting}} by Roy Lichtenstein. It is a quotation of Erle Loran's diagram of a Cézanne {{painting of the}} same name. It {{was one of the}} works exhibited at Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition in Los Angeles. The work became controversial in that it led to a reconsideration of what constitutes art.|$|E
5|$|The work {{dates from}} Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition, and is {{regarded}} by art critics as revolutionary {{both as a}} progression of <b>pop</b> <b>art</b> and {{as a work of}} modern art in general. It was later reproduced in his 1973 painting, Artist's Studio—Look Mickey, which shows the painting hanging prominently on a facing wall of Lichtenstein's studio.|$|E

5|$|Whaam! is a 1963 diptych {{painting}} by the American artist Roy Lichtenstein. It {{is one of}} the best-known works of <b>pop</b> <b>art,</b> and among Lichtenstein's most important paintings. Whaam! was first exhibited at the Leo Castelli Gallery in New York City in 1963, and purchased by the Tate Gallery, London, in 1966. It has been on permanent display at Tate Modern since 2006.|$|E
5|$|Developing an {{interest}} in modern art, in the early 1960s Hergé befriended the art dealer Marcel Stal, owner of the Carrefour gallery in Brussels. He was a particular fan {{of the work of}} Constant Permeke, Jakob Smits, Lucio Fontana, and Jean-Pierre Raynaurd, as well as the <b>pop</b> <b>art</b> movement, in particular the work of Roy Lichtenstein. He built up his own personal collection, which consisted of both modern paintings as well as African art and Chinese ceramics.|$|E
5|$|Fellow street artist Shepard Fairey {{wrote in}} Swindle:Invader's <b>pop</b> <b>art</b> may seem shallow, but {{by taking the}} risk of {{illegally}} re-contextualizing video game characters in an urban environment that provides more chaotic social interaction than a gamer's bedroom, he makes a statement about the desensitizing nature of video games and consumer culture. In a postmodern paradox, a game like Grand Theft Auto takes {{the danger of the}} streets and puts it in a safe video game, while Invader takes a safe video game icon and inserts it into the danger of the streets.|$|E

5|$|Girl in Mirror (sometimes Girl in the Mirror) is a 1964 porcelain-enamel-on-steel <b>pop</b> <b>art</b> {{painting}} by Roy Lichtenstein {{that is considered}} to exist in between eight and ten editions. One edition {{was part of a}} $14 million 2012 lawsuit regarding a 2009 sale, while another sold in 2010 for $4.9 million. Although it uses Ben-Day dots like many other Lichtenstein works, it was inspired by the New York City Subway rather than directly from a panel of a romance comics work.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, audiences {{had a very}} {{different}} take on his work. Many perceived it as a subversive and Marxist satire on American capitalism. If not subversive, {{it was at least}} considered a Marxist critique of pop culture. Given Warhol's apolitical outlook in general this is not likely the intended message. It is likely that his <b>pop</b> <b>art</b> was nothing more than an attempt to attract attention to his work.|$|E
5|$|Look Mickey (also {{known as}} Look Mickey!) is a 1961 {{oil on canvas}} {{painting}} by Roy Lichtenstein.

5|$|Several anecdotal stories {{supposedly}} {{explain why}} Warhol chose Campbell's Soup cans as {{the focal point}} of his <b>pop</b> <b>art.</b> One reason is that he needed a new subject after he abandoned comic strips, a move taken in part due to his respect for the refined work of Roy Lichtenstein. According to Ted Carey—one of Warhol's commercial art assistants in the late 1950s—it was Muriel Latow who suggested the idea for both the soup cans and Warhol's early U.S. dollar paintings.|$|E
5|$|Stoddart {{was born}} in Edinburgh and raised in Renfrewshire, where he {{developed}} an early interest {{in the arts and}} music, and later trained in fine art at the Glasgow School of Art (1976–1980) and read the History of Art at the University of Glasgow. During this time he became increasingly critical of contemporary trends in art, such as <b>pop</b> <b>art,</b> and concentrated on creating figurine pieces in clay. Stoddart associates the lack of form in modern art with social decay; in contrast, his works include many classical allusions.|$|E
5|$|The Studio {{series was}} {{inspired}} by Matisse paintings, and Diane Waldman claims that this particular effort was modelled upon Matisse's L'Atelier Rouge (The Red Studio), although the Lichtenstein Foundation website credits two other Matisse works as inspiration as well as Fernand Léger's The Baluster, 1925, which is represented in the far right corner. Léger was one of Lichtenstein's closest friends. By incorporating Matisse in his own studio setting, Lichtenstein is perceived as presenting himself as Matisse's peer {{and in so doing}} repositions <b>pop</b> <b>art</b> as a historical style rather than a contemporary one.|$|E
