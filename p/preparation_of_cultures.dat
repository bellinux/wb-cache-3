40|$|Closed accessCommon {{symptoms}} of different neurodegenerative diseases start {{to develop in}} the second half of the human life. Several of these diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, are accompanied by severe disturbances of protein metabolism and homeostasis in the brain. Because microglial cells are, to some extent, responsible for the maintenance of this homeostasis, age-related functional changes of the microglia are important. We established, therefore, the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cultures</b> of primary microglial cells isolated from adult animals in comparison to the widely used standard model, primary microglial cells isolated from newborn animals. In addition, we investigated changes in the activation and in the protein homeostasis within these cells. The protein turn-over seems to be significantly impaired in microglial cells isolated from adult animals and this seems to be accompanied by a decline in proteasomal function, but not in the protease content. We were also able to demonstrate higher cell surface molecule expression and a higher basal NO release of microglia isolated from adult animals in comparison to the microglia isolated from newborn rats; however, the PMA stimulated oxidative burst was abolished completely in cells from adult animals. Microglia from adult animals were also not able to upregulate their protein metabolism after activation. From these investigations it was concluded that microglial cells from adult animals have significantly different metabolic properties in comparison to the widely used microglial cells from newborn animals...|$|E

40|$|Nutrition is an {{important}} issue of plant cultivation and experimentation with plant nutrients is a supporting tool for agriculture. However, use of high purity grade reagents as nutrient sources can be expensive and increases the cost of an experiment. The objective {{of this study was to}} minimize the acquisition cost of high purity grade reagents in experiments on plant nutrient deficiency by using the missing element technique through linear programming models, and to generate recommendation tables for <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>culture</b> solutions, as well as to quantify gains through a simulated experiment. Two linear programming models were formulated containing concentration constraints for each nutrient in the culture solution. Model A was based on 16 reagents for <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>culture</b> solution, while model B was based on 27 reagents, looking to increase choice options. Results showed that both models minimized the acquisition cost of reagents, allowing a 9. 03 % reduction in model A and a 25. 98 % reduction in model B. The missing sulfur treatment proved the most costly for reagent acquisition while the missing nitrogen treatment proved the least costly.

The time required to reduce culture medium containing resazurin (an indicator of reducing conditions) was dramatically shortened when the medium, after being injected with the reducing agent cysteine, was irradiated with incandescent light from a halogen lamp. Light intensity had an effect upon reduction time: tubes kept in the dark took more than 12 h to achieve the desired degree of anaerobiosis (measured spectrophotometrically by the bleaching of the indicator, resazurin) while tubes subjected to ordinary laboratory illumination were reduced in about 2 h. When exposed to maximum light intensity (equivalent to a regular 100 watt bulb lamp) tubes could be made anaerobic in less than 20 min. Cysteine was essential for the bleaching of resazurin. Evidence that adequate anaerobiosis was achieved by light irradiation was provided by the fact that four Clostridium strains and one Thermoanaerobacter strain displayed similar growth (measured by lag time, growth rate, and extent of growth) in media reduced under high intensity light or under normal laboratory illumination...|$|R

With model substrates e. g. chemically modified keratius, histochemieal studies howed {{that in the}} regions attacked, S-thiosulphate esters were present apart from the carboxyls originating by proteolysls ofpeptide chains. Such groups arise from cleavage of eystine bonds by sulphite. Previous personal work showed that sulphite was produced uring growth of the fungus on a cy. *tlne-containing medium and {{it is assumed that}} the denaturation ofkeratin by sulphitolysis could be a key reaction in keratin decomposition by dermatophytes. One of the remarkable properties of dermatophytes is their ability to decompose keratin. The mechanism is not fully understood and there has been little success in decomposing keratin with cell-free nzymatic preparations. There are several hypotheses. Ragot (1966 a, 1967 a,b, 1968) and Yu, Harmon & Blank (1968, 1969) think that the fungi secrete a specific protease, keratinase, which itself or with further proteases decomposes the substrate. However, such enzymes have not been isolated and <b>preparations</b> <b>of</b> <b>culture</b> fluids and mycelial homogenates are only weakly keratinolytic (Chattaway, Ellis & Barlow, 1963; Chesters & Mathison, 1963). Even the keratinolytic enzyme isolated in a pure state by Yu et al. (1969) dissolved only about 15 % of the native keratin. Most authors assume that fungi first denature keratin in some way and render it thus digestible to less specific proteases. Chattaway et al...|$|R

This material is prepared from certain marine algae and, {{due to the fact that}} it is used as a food in the Orient and for medicinal purposes in Europe and America, as well as due to its employment for the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>culture</b> media, its chemical nature has received considerable attention. It has been found that the composition of the agar varies with the nature of the plant from which it is obtained. Japanese agar is usually prepared from Gelidium corneum, while other species of Gelidium and species of Gracillaria, Fucus and Eucheuma are also employed in different parts of the world. Although agar contains a considerable amount of ash, themajor part of it consists of one or more hemicelluloses, or carbohydrates which are readily hydrolized by hot dilute mineral acids. The most important constituent of the agar is a galactan, first referred to by Payen as gelose, to which he gave the formula C 6 Hjo 05. Czapek (1913) in summarizing the results of previous investiga-tors, concludes that one-third of the agar consists of galactan. On treatment of agar with nitric acid, mucic and oxalic acids are produced. Pentosans are usually reported to be present in agar but in very small amounts. Fellers (1916) reported the presenc...|$|R

Critical changes included thermostat replacement, redesign of the temperature control circuit, and {{removal of the}} cathodic anticorrosion system. These alterations provided accurate temperature and pH control. The bioreactor was used to cultivate selected strains of the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus and other species within this genus. Reformulation of a basal salts medium facilitated <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> large <b>culture</b> volumes and eliminated sterilization-induced precipitation of medium components. Substrate induction of synthesis of the S. solfataricus-secreted alpha-amylase during growth in a defined medium supported {{the utility of the}} bioreactor for studies of physiologically regulated processes. An improved purification strategy was developed by using strong cation-exchange chromatography for recovery of the alpha-amylase and the processing of large sample volumes <b>of</b> acidic <b>culture</b> supernatant. These findings should simplify efforts to study acidophilic hyperthermophilic microbes and their secreted proteins...|$|R
