40|$|Abstract- Domestic {{induction}} hobs {{have been}} becoming increasingly popular, {{due to its}} specific features of safety, cleanliness, quick warming and high efficiency. Some of these features derive {{of the fact that}} the heating is directly generated in the vessel, unlike the traditional contact heating methods. Specially, the later feature is attracting the attention of researchers devoted to highly efficient power electronic systems. Domestic induction heating technology requires specific features such as high output power levels in a reduced enclosure, large load variation, and reduced cost with high efficiency. Domestic induction appliances require power converters that feature high efficiency and accurate power control in a wide range of operating conditions. In order to achieve this aim, an ac– ac boost resonant converter is proposed in this paper. The main features of this proposal are the improved efficiency, reduced component count, proper output power control and reduced Total harmonic distortion (THD). With the addition of a <b>passive</b> <b>filter</b> <b>circuit,</b> input current total harmonic distortion can be decreased. Converter design procedure is also analyzed. And an experimental setup has been carried out. Keywords- Induction heating, efficiency improvement, resonan...|$|E
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. A new control method for active power filters {{in conjunction with a}} <b>passive</b> <b>filter</b> <b>circuit</b> are presented and analysed in this thesis. A new technique for load modelling is introduced in order to enable the design of compensators to improve the power factor and to reduce harmonic levels in electrical power systems. The principles of analysis, design, operation and control of the new circuit equipped with IGBTs are presented. This enables the compensation of rapidly changing loads and reactive power. A special circuit equipped with IGBTs is able to compensate for the reactive power and harmonic currents of different orders. The important aspect of the present work is based on the compensator control circuit for power factor correction and harmonic elimination, and its application. This new configuration improves the rating of the active power filter, reducing power losses in the switches compared to existing and newly developed active filters. Furthermore, it is very stable in operation and much faster by a factor of 20. The thesis also presents a detailed mathematical modelling of the proposed system with frequency and time domain equations. The frequency response of the proposed system is also discussed. This new proposal has been checked using a dedicated software simulation program, which was specifically developed for this purpose. An experimental set-up has been designed and implemented in order to apply the new method using IGBTs as well as some other devices. This thesis also presents a critical literature survey, which provides a critical overview of previous work relevant to the power quality improvement reactive power compensation and active filtering...|$|E
