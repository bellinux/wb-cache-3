50|$|The Cockpit Voice Recorder (black box) was {{successfully}} {{recovered from the}} wreckage. Preliminary information released on 28 July 2008, indicates the crew departed Mérida with inoperative navigation equipment and subsequently became disoriented in the mountainous terrain surrounding the airport, crashing {{into the side of}} a mountain while trying to determine their location. Subsequent investigation concluded that the pilots took off without conducting the mandatory <b>pre-flight</b> <b>procedures</b> and used an unauthorised departure route.|$|R
2500|$|In {{response}} to the incident, Emirates reviewed its <b>pre-flight</b> <b>procedures,</b> mandating the duplication of laptop computers used for pre-flight planning so as to ensure dual data entry. They are also developing an avionics system for take-off acceleration-monitoring and alerting. Airbus updated its software to detect erroneous data. In October 2011, they announced plans to include a software program to calculate the required runway length. Furthermore, Airbus is developing a monitoring system to compute required acceleration rates and apply a [...] "reasonableness test" [...] to data input and alert the pilot to any potential errors. The system could potentially be certified by 2015.|$|R

40|$|Human {{error in}} {{commercial}} aviation has recently come {{again to the}} fore in three accidents, all within a month of one another in February and March 2009. We focus on a take-off accident in Melbourne. Various tasks involved in pre-flight cockpit preparation are crucial, but vulnerable to error, which {{may be caused by}} such phenomena as third-party interruptions in cockpit <b>pre-flight</b> <b>procedures,</b> whose intensity has been remarked by pilots and recently investigated by NASA. Were known techniques for fault-tolerance in computing to be applied to pre-flight cockpit preparation and more rigorously supported by computational devices, the major possibilities for human error could be avoided. Basic Flying Skills The basics of flying aircraft are instilled in pilots from their first day of flight. Two of those basics are, first, to calculate the aircraft's weight, and its balance point, before flying to ensure they are within the range for the aircraft to remain controllable in flight, and, second, when flying to ensure the airspeed always remains within range (too fast, and the airplane might break apart; too slow, and the wing stops flying, a condition known as a “stall”) ...|$|R

5000|$|Two main non-technical {{skills that}} {{transfer}} to the aircraft are social and cognitive skills. Social skills are behaviors mostly done verbally through communication, allowing crew members to discuss possible conflicts and work together to resolve problems. It heavily emphasizes teamwork, a critical component for an effective operation of aircraft which impacts aviation safety. [...] Examples of communication between crew members include acknowledging commands, conducting briefings, and conveying information, all essential components for a safe and efficient flight. The Federal Aviation Administration also announced that important areas of communication improvements include <b>pre-flight</b> briefings,and landing <b>procedures.</b> Cognitive skills are mental processes occurred for gaining situation awareness and selecting decisions, it includes tasks such as planning, prioritizing and decision making. [...] This set of skill cannot be observed directly, {{but it can be}} inferred by examiners when pilot state a decision, an option has taken place. [...] A pilot with a strong cognitive mind is more proficient in emergency situations, having a bigger mental capacity to assess the situation and monitor progression on goals.The framework for NOTECHS is divided into three different levels.|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} years, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) {{have been largely}} {{employed}} in civil applications, such as aerial photography and topographic mapping, environmental monitoring, search and rescue, prevent of fires and disasters, environmental research and general photography and videos. Nevertheless, according to (AUVSI, 2013), agriculture is the main application where UAS will be employed in the near future. Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are flexible, {{easy to use and}} relative low-cost; thus, they can be employed in monitoring activities in precision farming, ensuring a prompt reaction to plant disease, lack of plants nutrients and environmental changes that are the main focus for farm efficiency and productivity. Recent development in high-resolution remote sensing and image processing technology has yield to small- size sensors compatible with small UAV payload weight. Each kind of sensor needs a certain flight pattern over the fields. However, a Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) used for specialized operations or experimental activities has to be compliant with National Civil Aviation Authority regulations. On 2015, the Italian Aviation Authority (ENAC) published the second edition of the regulatory issue for this kind of aircrafts. The aim of this paper is the management analysis of RPAS for their use in survey missions for precision faming, taking into account the Italian regulatory prescription and two different kind of commercial sensors. UAVs are considered similarly to any other farm machine, describing the operative workflow and analysing the elementary time procedures associated to the different ways of planning a flight mission of the UAS on the field to be monitored. Actual rates of works, Effective Field Capacity (EFC) and Field Efficiency (FE), field coverage and survey cost are finally provided. The analysis includes also in-field <b>pre-flight</b> calibration <b>procedures...</b>|$|R
40|$|In-flight {{aggression}} {{is the term}} used to describe aggressive behaviour during flights. The dangers such behaviour pose are evident when the lives of passengers and cabin crew are threatened. In the worst case scenario, passenger/s will barged into the cockpit and interfere with flight controls, causing the aircraft to crash while losing all lives onboard. This study investigates the magnitude of in-flight aggression {{and some of the}} triggers that lead passengers to it. It also examines the effectiveness of some measures and the environment which in-flight aggression manifest. The results showed that cabin crew were exposed to the serious dangers of in-flight aggression 6 times more than an average passenger. After September 11 th, passengers became more aware of the dangers of in-flight aggression and were more willing to assist cabin crew should the need arise. Alcohol was found to be the top trigger of in-flight aggression and cabin crew intervention of such behaviour is most effective compared to other measures such as flight crew, other passengers, legislation, etc. Some aspects of airline policies and procedures related to the management of in-flight aggression require attention. <b>Pre-flight</b> and in-flight <b>procedures</b> and policies were only moderately effective and experienced cabin crew found them disappointing. Airlines encourages their crew to report incidents and have high safety standards which they expect cabin crew to adhere to strictly, failing which cabin crew are likely to face disciplinary actions. However the cabin crew were seldom informed about outcome of incidents and lessons drawn from incidents seldom led to policy or procedural improvements. Cabin crew believed that both physical and psychological passenger management techniques should be incorporated in training and many would like to be trained in self-defence although many airlines do not provide such training. There is some evidence that profiles of passenger and cabin crew can be used to predict a potential perpetrator and the effectiveness of a cabin crew managing an incident. Based on the finding, several recommendations were made to better manage in-flight aggression...|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} {{method of}} calibration has been devised for instruments that utilize tunable lasers {{to measure the}} absorption spectra of atmospheric gases {{in order to determine}} the relative abundances of the gases. In this method, CO 2 in the atmosphere is used as a natural calibration standard. Unlike in one prior calibration method, it is not necessary to perform calibration measurements in advance of use of the instrument and to risk deterioration of accuracy with time during use. Unlike in another prior calibration method, it is not necessary to include a calibration gas standard (and the attendant additional hardware) in the instrument and to interrupt the acquisition of atmospheric data to perform calibration measurements. In the operation of an instrument of this type, the beam from a tunable diode laser or a tunable quantum-cascade laser is directed along a path through the atmosphere, the laser is made to scan in wavelength over an infrared spectral region that contains one or two absorption spectral lines of a gas of interest, and the transmission (and, thereby, the absorption) of the beam is measured. The concentration of the gas of interest can then be calculated from the observed depth of the absorption line(s), given the temperature, pressure, and path length. CO 2 is nearly ideal as a natural calibration gas for the following reasons: CO 2 has numerous rotation/vibration infrared spectral lines, many of which are near absorption lines of other gases. The concentration of CO 2 relative to the concentrations of the major constituents of the atmosphere is well known and varies slowly and by a small enough amount to be considered constant for calibration in the present context. Hence, absorption-spectral measurements of the concentrations of gases of interest can be normalized to the concentrations of CO 2. Because at least one CO 2 calibration line is present in every spectral scan of the laser during absorption measurements, the atmospheric CO 2 serves continuously as a calibration standard for every measurement point. Figure 1 depicts simulated spectral transmission measurements in a wavenumber range that contains two absorption lines of N 2 O and one of CO 2. The simulations were performed for two different upper-atmospheric pressures for an airborne instrument that has a path length of 80 m. The relative abundance of CO 2 in air was assumed to be 360 parts per million by volume (approximately its natural level in terrestrial air). In applying the present method to measurements like these, one could average the signals from the two N 2 O absorption lines and normalize their magnitudes to that of the CO 2 absorption line. Other gases with which this calibration method can be used include H 2 O, CH 4, CO, NO, NO 2, HOCl, C 2 H 2, NH 3, O 3, and HCN. One can also take advantage of this method to eliminate an atmospheric-pressure gauge and thereby reduce the mass of the instrument: The atmospheric pressure can be calculated from the temperature, the known relative abundance of CO 2, and the concentration of CO 2 as measured by spectral absorption. Natural CO 2 levels on Mars provide an ideal calibration standard. Figure 2 shows a second example of the application of this method to Mars atmospheric gas measurements. For sticky gases like H 2 O, the method is particularly powerful, since water is notoriously difficult to handle at low concentrations in <b>pre-flight</b> calibration <b>procedures...</b>|$|R
