40|$|International audiencePurposeThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide some keys to {{understand}} and manage the dynamic of client-supplier innovation cooperation. Design/methodology/approachThe results presented in this paper are based on a mixed methods approach that combines interviews with practitioners, quantitative inquiry on 160 client-supplier innovation cooperations and 18 -month ethnography within an Innovation-Purchasing department. FindingsAt the first stage of a relationship, when trust and familiarity are low, unstructured organization has to be avoided and elaborated <b>partnership</b> <b>privileged.</b> Later in a relationship, the power balance increases, so do trust and familiarity. In case of a power balance in large favor of the client, elaborated partnership presents the best performance in the first phases of the innovation project, and the unstructured organization allows better performance in the phases around market launch. If the power balance is favorable to the supplier, the exclusive partnership organization gives the best results for the relationship. Later, when trust and familiarity attain the highest levels, and when the power is balanced within the couple, elaborated partnership is best suited from design to industrialization phases. In upstream phases, project-type organizations can be substituted to exclusive partnership: both allow the relationship to reach the highest scores. Originality/valueThe paper offers levers for managing innovation cooperation at macro and micro levels, taking into account the impact of the client-supplier relationship.

40|$|In 2005 the EU and Turkey officially started {{accession}} negotiations that {{were intended to}} lead to Turkey’s full membership of the EU. Yet today, the Turkish accession process has virtually {{ground to a halt}} and lost all credibility. Talk of alternatives to full membership can be heard from various sides; we highlight four instances of what we call ‘parallelism’, namely the elusive concept of a ‘privileged partnership’, the EU-Turkey customs union, the recently launched ‘Positive Agenda’ and Turkish participation in the Energy Community Treaty. While a <b>privileged</b> <b>partnership</b> represents a more comprehensive but still remote framework for EU-Turkish relations, the latter three are merely an escape route from preaccession. We conclude our analysis with a discussion on Turkey’s possible membership of the European Economic Area, which in effect would serve none of the parties involved. We conclude that both partners, the EU and Turkey, would be well advised to remember their pre-accession commitments of 13 years ago – for their mutual benefit...|$|E

This study is also a contribution to the current discussion of whether Turkey should be granted full EU membership or a <b>privileged</b> <b>partnership</b> with the EU, which for Turkey would mean improved access to the EU market for its products, among other benefits. Our investigation focuses on the latter policy outcome: the impact of deepening the Customs Union between Turkey and the EU and applying the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) to Turkish agricultural exports. To this end, the impact of the 1996 Customs Union covering most industrial goods and processed agricultural goods, is evaluated on a sectoral level.

40|$|The two Christian key-concepts „creation“ and „sin“ {{refer to}} an {{understanding}} of human life which interpret it as bodily, vulnerable, sociable life destined to individual freedom, but actually unable to realise its destiny without the courtesy of mutual forgiveness. The reference to an absolute transcendental personal ground for such forgiveness is based on the actuality of the latter. (1) In ethical discourses of liberal, secular societies, the two Christian key-concepts „creation“ and „sin“ are mostly abandoned for different reasons and in different intensity, in addition they are at least partly replaced by secular concepts like “human dignity” and “responsibility”. Nevertheless, such replacements do not function perfectly. At least the concept of creation is already reappearing in secular political contexts (like the Swiss constitution of 1999). (2) There is a need and also an opportunity to re-import those Christian concepts into secular ethical dialogues. For that purpose they have to be interpreted by connecting them with basic human biographical experiences of social and bodily individualisation. (3) A good example for both, the problems of a purely secular understanding of basic human relationships and the helpful potentiality of a Christian anthropology to solve such problems, are the present ethical and legal debates on marriage and family. The German term “Lebensgemeinschaft” (cohabitation, properly: “symbiotic community” or “community of life”) which is often used to define a (intentionally exclusive) <b>privileged</b> <b>partnership</b> refers to a anthropological concept of individuality which is itself fundamentally connected or connectable with associations being preserved in the Christian concepts of “creation” and “sin”...|$|E
40|$|The EU's {{commencement}} of accession negotiations with Turkey in October 2005 represents a watershed in Turkish-EU relations. However, {{even in the}} area of straightforward technicalities, the negotiations are linked to a wider set of unresolved and highly sensitive political issues, of which the Cyprus question is the most significant. Unresolved Aegean disputes with Greece and the Armenian issue form another set of wider external issues that affect the day-to-day framework of the negotiations. Internal issues that can have repercussions on the negotiations include Kurdish minority rights and the decision of the European Court of Human Rights calling for a retrial of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan. The EU accession process has left Turkey with the dilemma of how to reconcile its internal and external policy challenges. Traditionally, Turkey has separated its internal security challenges, such as Kurdish separatism and Islamic fundamentalism, from its external security relations, which are based on state-centric security relationships. This situation is being superseded by an emergent discourse on Turkish foreign policy, as Euro-sceptics who frame Turkey's national security within a traditionalist military-dominant perspective are challenged by pro-EU actors who view economic instability as more significant than traditional military threats. While Turkey's uniqueness - such as the special place of its military within the state and society - is difficult for the EU to grasp, the very speciality of the Turkish case does not in itself warrant an alternative to full membership, such as <b>privileged</b> <b>partnership.</b> All previous accession negotiations have ended in full membership. If Turkey were to become an exception after it has made headway in implementing EU criteria, this would have wider repercussions for Turkey's relations with the West and the EU's image in the Islamic world at large. Thus, the Turkish case probably constitutes the greatest challenge the EU has had to face in dealing with an accession country...|$|E
40|$|Today the European Union has 27 member states. Each {{enlargement}} {{has led to}} {{a fierce}} debate in the union if and how the enlargement is supposed to be done. How big can the union become? A set of criteria, the Copenhagen criteria, has to be fulfilled for a country to be accepted as a full member of the union. Turkey took its first steps toward accession when they became a candidate for accession in the year of 1999. Turkey did not fulfil the obligation for respect of the Human Rights. Therefore they started reforming their political system and legislation. The prospect of Turkish accession to the EU has started a debate. Why do some fear the prospect when others see it as an opportunity? The purpose of the essay was to explore and analyse which discourses are presently existing in the EU concerning the relationship with Turkey. The purpose was met by a discourse analysis made from three nodal points (sub discourses) : democracy, human rights and politics. The information was gathered from the political groups which are at present represented in the European parliament. Some conclusions could be made: (1) five different discourses concerning Turkey and the EUs relationship where found, each making a unique viewpoint: full membership, eventual membership, <b>privileged</b> <b>partnership,</b> strategic partnership and objection to Turkish membership. Those who want a Turkish accession to the EU see the greatest good coming from such an arrangement, for both parties. The overall discourse put focus on the fact that Turkey can adapt to the European way and Turkeys potential role as a bridge between the European and Muslim world is the dominant argument. The EU is viewed as a trans national organisation rather than an entity that is limited to a specific territory (Europe). Those who oppose Turkish accession or propose partnership has an opposite view. They think that the EU shares characteristics with the nation-state that has its base in a specific territory and peoples who share the same history, culture and religion. : (2) At this juncture a potential majority for Turkish accession would be very small, there are to many unknown variables. It does not exist a dominant discourse. The discourses are fighting for dominance and {{who is going to be}} the winner is not clear. All the discourses can therebye said to exist in the discursive field. Though there is unity in the sub discourses democracy and human rights. The common view is that these are not at an acceptable level in Turkey today. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
