50|$|The <b>psychrometers</b> were a wet bulb-dry bulb pair of thermometers. The {{moisture}} evaporating {{from the}} wet fabric on one bulb cooled it, {{the lower the}} humidity the lower the temperature. By comparing the two temperatures, {{it was possible to}} calculate the relative humidity. The thermometers were inside the nose of the airplane. Air was trapped by probes attached to the outside and directed in over the thermometer bulbs. When the psychrometer was first tried in the airplanes, the readings were inaccurate. It was found that when exposed to an airstream moving over 200 mph, the friction of the air heated the thermometers. The amount of heating was unpredictable, making it impossible to calculate a correction. New <b>psychrometers</b> were developed that slowed the air before making the readings. With these devices, accuracy was 98-99%.|$|E

40|$|In this research, an {{improved}} <b>psychrometer</b> is developed to solve practical issues arising {{in the relative}} humidity measurement of challenging drying environments for meat manufacturing in agricultural and agri-food industries. The design in this research focused {{on the structure of}} the improved <b>psychrometer,</b> signal conversion, and calculation methods. The experimental results showed the effect of varying <b>psychrometer</b> structure on relative humidity measurement accuracy. An industrial application to dry-cured meat products demonstrated the effective performance of the improved <b>psychrometer</b> being used as a relative humidity measurement sensor in meat-drying rooms. In a drying environment for meat manufacturing, the achieved measurement accuracy for relative humidity using the improved <b>psychrometer</b> was ± 0. 6 %. The system test results showed that the improved <b>psychrometer</b> can provide reliable and long-term stable relative humidity measurements with high accuracy in the drying system of meat products...|$|R
50|$|A <b>psychrometer</b> is {{a device}} that {{includes}} both a dry-bulb and a wet-bulb thermometer. A sling <b>psychrometer</b> requires manual operation to create the airflow over the bulbs, but a powered <b>psychrometer</b> includes a fan for this function. Knowing both the dry-bulb temperature (DBT) and wet-bulb temperature (WBT), one can determine the relative humidity (RH) from the psychrometric chart appropriate to the air pressure.|$|R
50|$|Relative {{humidity}} is {{computed from}} the ambient temperature {{as shown by}} the dry-bulb thermometer and the difference in temperatures {{as shown by the}} wet-bulb and dry-bulb thermometers. Relative humidity can also be determined by locating the intersection of the wet and dry-bulb temperatures on a psychrometric chart. The two thermometers coincide when the air is fully saturated, and the greater the difference the drier the air. <b>Psychrometers</b> are commonly used in meteorology, and in the HVAC industry for proper refrigerant charging of residential and commercial air conditioning systems.|$|E
5000|$|In 1867, when he {{came back}} from the world {{exhibition}} in Paris and brought the first chromic acid cell with him, he also met the astronomer Wilhelm Klinkerfues. Klinkerfues had developed a bifilar-hygrometer which was widely used but did not prove in laymen's hands. After that Lambrecht built a hair hygrometer, [...] "Model Klinkerfues". In 1873, after separation from Klinkerfues, Lambrecht started to build new meteorological instruments such as polymeters, dew point monitors, and aspiration <b>psychrometers.</b> His weather telegraphs, weather columns and combinations of different meteorological instruments were in use at several bigger cities and foreign health resorts before World War I. Lambrecht also built medical thermometers. At the same time he developed the so-called minimum thermometer with a narrowing of the lumen of the capillary which is placed above the mercury container. His precision instruments are well-known all over the world.|$|E
50|$|Between 1846 and 1852 Charles Brooke {{invented a}} series of self-recording {{instruments}} for the automatic registration of measurements using a light-source, mirrors and optics to amplify readings and a clockwork drum covered in photographic paper to record the results. These instruments included barometers, thermometers, <b>psychrometers,</b> and magnetometers, which registered their variations by means of photography. Charles Brooke's inventions obtained an award from the British Admiralty {{as well as a}} medal from the jurors of the Great Exhibition. The account of the perfecting of these apparatus is detailed in the British Association Reports from 1846 to 1849, and in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of 1847, 1850, and 1852. These self-recording instruments were adopted at the Royal Observatories of Greenwich and Paris. In 1859 a self-recording magnetometer of United States manufacture, based on the designed of Charles Brooke, was built by the Coast Survey and the Smithsonian Institution at a magnetic observatory {{on the grounds of the}} Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC. The Smithsonian report also noted that the Toronto Magnetic and Meteorological Observatory had a self-registering magnetograph in 1850, which was described by General John Henry Lefroy, in Silliman's Journal, May, 1850.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{main purpose}} of this work is to present the manufacturing, {{calibration}} and validation of a system for wet and dry bulb temperature measurements obtained on a new <b>psychrometer.</b> The calibration has lead to the adjustment of the appropriate <b>psychrometer</b> coefficient for the developed <b>psychrometer,</b> {{as a function of}} the wet bulb temperature, which fits best with experimental data, obtained on the range from 34 % to 87 % RH and 15 °C to 30 °C. Another set of experimental points on this range was used for evaluation of the <b>psychrometer</b> uncertainty. An electronic hygrometer was calibrated simultaneously, and its calibration was also evaluated. The uncertainty of the Relative Humidity obtained in the calibration of the <b>psychrometer</b> was found to be only slightly higher than the uncertainty for the electronic hygrometer. For the wet-bulb temperature determination, the hygrometer presents itself as more precise, while the <b>psychrometer</b> was more accurate. Either could be used for technological development of the humidifier, but the <b>psychrometer</b> delivers a direct measurement of the wet-bulb temperature, independent of the local pressure and dry-bulb temperature, which affects the calculation obtained from the hygrometer data...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate response times of a salinity sensor and a soil <b>psychrometer.</b> Influences of pressure, temperature and molar concentration changes were to be measured. Salinity sensor response times ranged from 50 to 130 minutes during solution adsorption while desorption response times were perhaps ten times as long. Temperature affected both response times and equilibrium values, but pressure did not affect either. Soil <b>psychrometer</b> response times ranged from from 40 to 80 minutes for either adsorption or desorption of solution. However, other factors probably related to indirectness of measurement made the soil <b>psychrometer</b> fail to reflect osmotic potential. Both pressure and temperature effects were significant. Comparisons between hypothetical soil water infiltration times and sensor response times together with soil <b>psychrometer</b> failure led to the conclusion that the salinity sensor may be useful while the soil <b>psychrometer</b> would probably not be useful for the return-flow water quality control...|$|R

40|$|Leaf water {{potentials}} {{measured by}} in situ psychrometry {{were compared with}} leaf water potentials measured by the pressure chamber technique at various values of water potential in Helianthus annuus, Helianthus nuttallii, Vigna unguiculata, Nerium oleander, Pistacia vera, and Corylus avellana. In V. unguiculata, the leaf water potentials measured by the in situ psychrometer oscillated at the same periodicity as, and proportional to, the leaf conductance. In all species, potentials measured by in situ <b>psychrometers</b> operating in the psychrometric mode were linearly correlated with potentials measured with the pressure chamber. However, the in situ <b>psychrometers</b> underestimated the leaf water potential in the two Helianthus species at low water potentials and overestimated the water potential in P. vera, N. oleander, and C. avellana. The underestimation in the two Helianthus species at low water potentials resulted from differences in water potential across the leaf. The overestimation in P. vera, N. oleander, and C. avellana was considered to arise from low epidermal conductances in these species even after abrasion of the cuticle. Pressure-volume studies with Lycopersicon esculentum showed that less water was expressed from distal than proximal leaflets when the whole leaf was slowly pressurized. The implication of this for water relations characteristics obtained by pressure-volume techniques is discussed. We conclude that in situ <b>psychrometers</b> are suitable for following dynamic changes in leaf water potential, but should be used with caution on leaves with low epidermal conductances...|$|E

40|$|Relative {{humidity}} (RH) measurements, as {{derived from}} wet-bulb and dry-bulb thermometers operated as a <b>psychrometer</b> within a thermometer screen, have limited accuracy because of natural ventilation variations. Standard RH calculations generally assume a fixed screen <b>psychrometer</b> coefficient, {{but this is}} too small during poor ventilation. By comparing a reference humidity probe—exposed within a screen containing a psychrometer—with wind-speed measurements under controlled conditions, a wind-speed correction for the screen <b>psychrometer</b> coefficient has been derived and applicable when 2 -metre wind speeds fall below 3 ms– 1. Applying this to hourly-averaged data reduced the mean moist RH bias of the <b>psychrometer</b> (over the reference probe) from 1. 2 % to 0. 4 %, and reduced the inter-quartile range of the RH differences from 2. 0 % to 0. 8 %.

Results from the single-hole tests showed several significant correlations between permeability and injection rate and between permeability and test order. Fracture permeability values determined by cross-hole pneumatic testing in fractured ash-flow tuff ranged from 0. 81 to 3. 49 x 10 {sup - 14 } m{sup 2 }, depending on injection rate and analysis method used. Results from the cross-hole tests monitor intervals showed no significant correlation between permeability and injection rate; however, results from the injection interval showed a significant correlation between injection rate and permeability. Porosity estimates from the cross-hole testing range from 0. 8 to 2. 0 percent. The maximum temperature change associated with the pneumatic testing was 1. 2 {degrees}C measured in the injection interval during cross-hole testing. The maximum temperature change in the guard and monitor intervals was 0. 1 {degrees}C. The maximum error introduced into the permeability values due to temperature fluctuations is approximately 4 percent. Data from temperature monitoring in the borehole indicated {{a positive correlation between}} the temperature decrease in the injection interval during recovery testing and the gas-injection rate. The thermocouple <b>psychrometers</b> indicated that water vapor was condensing in the boreholes during testing. The <b>psychrometers</b> in the guard and monitor intervals detected the drier injected gas as an increase in the dry bulb reading. The relative humidity in the test intervals was always higher than the upper measurement limit of the <b>psychrometers.</b> Although the installation of the packer system may have altered the water balance of the borehole, the gas-injection testing resulted in minimal or no changes in the borehole relative humidity...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{development}} of the peltier-type thermocouple psychrometer has made possible the measurement of soil moisture potentials to values as low as - 80 bars. The applicability {{of this type of}} psychrometer to "in situ" measurements of moisture potential at a Sonoran desert field site is investigated. An evaluation is made of the effect of variations in soil temperature, moisture content, and solute concentrations on the psychrometric measurements. Moisture potential measurements with the psychrometer are shown to be limited to a moisture content range composing approximately 50 per cent of the total variation in soil moisture observed during the study. A significant quantity of moisture is transferred across the soilatmosphere interface at moisture contents both above and below the measurement range of the psychrometer. Psychrometric measurements cannot be used to determine the total moisture flux into or out of the soil horizon. The temperature component of the total soil moisture potential is not measurable with the thermocouple psychrometer. Under conditions occurring frequently within the study period, this component is shown to be of equivalent or greater magnitude than the components measured with psychrometric techniques. Laboratory measurements of the sorption-desorption isotherms for the field soils were made using thermocouple <b>psychrometers.</b> The isotherms vary significantly among samples, as a function of soil composition. This variation prevents the determination of absolute values of soil moisture content from measurements of soil moisture potential. However, for the soils at the field site, the slope of the moisture isotherms at a given potential does not vary significantly among samples. Psychrometric measurements can be used to determine moisture content changes at the study site, within the measurement range of the <b>psychrometers.</b> The variation in moisture isotherms, the significance of temperature induced moisture flux, and the limited moisture range of psychrometric measurements prevents the construction of a quantitative model of soil moisture movement from potential measurements made with thermocouple <b>psychrometers.</b> The effect of Celtis pallida (desert hackberry), a native plant species, on the soil moisture regime is described. Moisture uptake by the plant, and precipitation input to the soil near the plant are described in terms of the potential variations they produce. The particular hackberry plant studied is shown to be removing moisture from the soil at potential values as low as - 30 atmospheres. Moisture potentials in the root zone were within the measurement range of the <b>psychrometers</b> throughout most of the year. The measurement of soil moisture potentials with the thermocouple psychrometer is shown to be an effective means of studying moisture content variations in the root zone of desert plant species...|$|E

The results suggest that <b>psychrometers</b> need direct calibration at the target pressures or that pressure corrected charts are required.

As part of the Nevada Nuclear Waste Storage Investigations Project of the US Department of Energy, the US Geological Survey has been conducting hydrologic, geologic, and geophysical investigations at Yucca Mountain and the surrounding region to provide data evaluation of the potential suitability of the site. Hydrologic investigations of the unsaturated zone at this site were started in 1982. A 17. 5 -inch- (44. 5 -centimeter-) diameter borehole (USW UZ- 1) was drilled by the reverse-air vacuum-drilling technique {{to a depth of}} 1269 feet (387 meters). This borehole was instrumented at 33 depth levels. At 15 of the levels, 3 well screens were embedded in coarse-sand columns. The sand columns were isolated from each other by thin layers of bentonite, columns of silica flour, and isolation plugs consisting of expansive cement. Thermocouple <b>psychrometers</b> and pressure transducers were installed within the screens and connected to the data-acquisition system at the land surface through thermocouple and logging cables. Two of the screens at each level were equipped with access tubes to allow collection of pore-gas samples.

40|$|Understanding the {{mechanism}} of humidity transduction calls for experimental data and a theory to interpret the data and design new experiments. A comprehensive theory of humidity transduction must start with agreement on what humidity parameters are measured by hygroreceptors and processed by the brain. Hygroreceptors {{have been found in}} cuticular sensilla of a broad range of insect species. Their structural features are far from uniform. Nevertheless, these sensilla always contain an antagonistic pair of a moist cell and a dry cell combined with a thermoreceptive cold cell. The strategy behind this arrangement remains unclear. Three main models of humidity transduction have been proposed. Hygroreceptors could operate as mechanical hygrometers, <b>psychrometers</b> or evaporation detectors. Each mode of action measures a different humidity parameter. Mechanical hygrometers measure the relative humidity, <b>psychrometers</b> indicate the wet-bulb temperature, and evaporimeters refer to the saturation deficit of the air. Here we assess the validity of the different functions by testing specific predictions drawn from each of the models. The effect of air temperature on the responses to humidity stimulation rules out the mechanical hygrometer function, but it supports the psychrometer function and highlights the action as evaporation rate detector. We suggest testing the effect of the flow rate of the air stream used for humidity stimulation. As the wind speed strongly affects the power of evaporation, experiments with changing saturation deficit at different flow rates would improve our knowledge on humidity transduction...|$|E

40|$|Classical water {{relations}} theory {{predicts that}} predawn plant water potential {{should be in}} equilibrium with soil water potential (soil Ψw) around roots, and many interpretations of plant water status in natural populations are based on this expectation. We examined this expectation for two salt-tolerant, cold-desert shrub species in glasshouse experiments where frequent watering assured homogeneity in soil Ψw and soil-root hydraulic continuity and where NaCl controlled soil Ψw. Plant water potentials were measured with a pressure chamber (xylem Ψp) and thermocouple <b>psychrometers</b> (leaf Ψw). Soil Ψw was measured with in situ thermocouple <b>psychrometers.</b> Predawn leaf Ψw and xylem Ψp were significantly more negative than soil Ψw, for many treatments, indicating large predawn soil-plant Ψw disequilibria: up to 1. 2 [*]MPa for Chrysothamnus nauseosus (0 and 100 [*]mm NaCl) and 1. 8 [*]MPa for Sarcobatus vermiculatus (0, 100, 300, and 600 [*]mm NaCl).

However, nighttime transpiration accounted for {{only part of the}} predawn disequilibrium. Other mechanisms that could act with nighttime transpiration to generate large predawn disequilibria are described and include a model of how leaf apoplastic solutes could contribute to the phenomenon.
