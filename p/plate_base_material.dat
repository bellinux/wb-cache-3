40|$|As {{a result}} of a global {{movement}} away from using lead (Pb) in electronic assemblies, component manufacturers are increasingly applying Tin-rich finishes to the leads of their devices. Unfortunately, this can create a risk of Tin whisker formation that can result in electrical failures if the gap between two adjacent component leads is bridged by a whisker. If bridging occurs, the effects can range from no effect to parametric system deviations to catastrophic circuit failure. Tin whisker risk management typically involves an evaluation of Tin <b>plating</b> attributes, <b>base</b> <b>material</b> of the component leads, underplating, lead-gap spacing, conformal coating, system use environment, and system reliability requirements. As an integral part of this management, a computational framework capable of quantifying the risk associated with Tin whisker-bridging failures is needed so that appropriate design, maintenance, and warranty decisions can be made. In the present work, a probabilistic model based on measured whisker observations is constructed. The model uses Monte Carlo simulation methods and quantifies the risk of Tin whiskers bridging the gap between two adjacent component leads. A dual-tail constraint strategy for constructing the whisker length probability density functions was established and applied to long and short-term bright Tin whisker length measurements. A bridging risk map also was developed to illustrate the relationship between lead-gap spacing, years of service life, and bridging risk. It was found that forming non-dimensional lead-gap spacing parameters provided useful insight into the risk posed by Tin whiskers...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes changes due to irradiation in {{optical properties}} of wave length shifter <b>materials</b> <b>based</b> on polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and of scintillator <b>materials</b> <b>based</b> on polystyrene (PS). These polymers are investigated after irradiation in #gamma#- and neutron fields under different conditions of absorbed dose, dose rate and surrounding atmosphere. This work presents {{studies of the}} dependencies of optical damage such as creation of absorption centers or destruction of colour dyes by the absorbed radiation dose. In much of the applied dose range from 1 kGy to 100 kGy a linear dependence of damage levels on the absorbed dose is observed. The influence of additives in the materials is also reported. The duration of the recovery process from the inital to the final damage height {{is determined by the}} diffusion of oxygen into the material. For approximately 2 mm thick <b>plates</b> of PS <b>based</b> <b>materials</b> the recovery process takes some days at standard temperature and pressure, for PMMA <b>based</b> <b>materials</b> of the same thickness some 100 days of recovery time is observed under the same conditions. By means of a diffusion model for both materials a dose rate can be calculated below which complete recovery to the final damage level occurs during irradiation. For PS based scintillators (2. 6 mm thick) the dose rate for complete recovery is 57 Gy/h, for PMMA based wave length shifters (2 mm thick) it is 0. 44 Gy/h. For the ZEUS calorimeter operating at the electron proton collider HERA at DESY in Hamburg in an estimated dose rate level of 0. 04 Gy/h in air atmosphere, a recovery to final damage values during operation can be concluded.

HT 9 {{has previously been}} studied as a structural component for fusion/fission based reactors; however, the changes in material microstructure and properties after friction stir welding have not been considered. HT 9 A steel plate was friction stir welded {{with a series of}} increasing heat inputs. The microstructure of this welded material was characterized using optical and electron microscopy. The mechanical properties of the welded material were determined using nanoindentation and microhardness measurements. In addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in molten lithium fluoride was used to assess the high temperature corrosion resistance of the welded material in the harsh environments found in fusion reactors. The quality of the friction stir welds was excellent, and the basic ferritic-martensitic microstructure was maintained for all of the conditions used. Some reduction in hardness was observed in the welded material, particularly in the heat affected zones.

The foam, once infiltrated with a second phase transforms into a composite where two distinct, continuous, three-dimensional network structures are formed. The advantage of this metal matrix composite is its high strength-to-weight ratio for use in lightweight applications such as electronic packaging materials. The electroless nickel coating and vacuum infiltration procedures are developed. Materials characterization of the composite is evaluated by microstructural and compositional analysis, and density, porosity, and nano-indentation measurements.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the infiltration of two porous structures. In the first, two different silicon sources were used to infiltrate structures derived from different Canadian pine, beech and maple species {{for the production of}} silicon carbide (SiC). This allows the use of a precursor structure that is already available, thus saving time, energy and cost of manufacturing. Carbonized wood species measuring 15 mm x 11 mm x 13 mm were used as precursors for the production of silicon carbide (SiC) using two silicon sources (sol and powder) in order to produce a porous SiC structure mimicking that of wood. The liquid sol was vacuum infiltrated into the pyrolyzed wood species, dried and reacted at 1575 °C under a 70 L/h flow of argon. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed SiC grains formed on the interior of the tracheid walls and a high density of SiC whiskers were discovered in certain tracheids of pine and vessels of beech and maple. Both cyclic and repeated infiltration processes were undertaken. In addition, infiltration of carbonized pine wood with molten silicon was carried out in order to obtain a porous SiC structure. Infiltration was based on capillary forces within the preform and the infiltration depth was measured. Optical microscope, SEM, EDS and XRD were used for microstructure characterization and phase identification. In the second part of this work, a liquid A 356 aluminum alloy was infiltrated into a porous silicon carbide foam structure. Three dimensional silicon carbide (SiC) ceramic foams were employed as reinforcement for producing an aluminum alloy metal matrix composite with potential as a <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> <b>material</b> in electronic packaging. These are commonly manufactured with aluminum/silicon carbide (Al/SiC) particulate materials, nickel-iron and copper alloys. A <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> provides mechanical strength to the integrated circuit design, as well as aids in transfering the heat from the chip to the heat sink. Packaging <b>base</b> <b>plate</b> <b>materials</b> are required to have low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), high thermal conductivity, and low density. A 356 aluminum alloy was vacuum infiltrated into a 100 PPI (pores per inch), silicon carbide (SiC) foam network, at 775 °C using an in-house built apparatus. It has been shown that this metal matrix composite has similar properties to traditional packaging materials with the added benefit of a lower density. CTE and thermal conductivity are within the range of commercially available materials, with porosity levels of 7 %, using this method. Flexural strength and Young's modulus of the composite provide reasonable values {{as a result of the}} low reinforcement concentration employed. Secondary Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to investigate the fractured surfaces of the Charpy, flexural strength and compression tests. In the Charpy and flexural strength samples, the A 356 aluminum-silicon alloy matrix shows signs of mixed fracture; cleavage regions and some dimpling. In the network structure, the majority of the failure is from SiC layers debonding from the aluminum matrix with some SiC layer peeling (inter-delamination). Compressive loading showed internal damage in the form of failed SiC struts. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis did not detect any brittle aluminum carbide at the Al/SiC interface.
