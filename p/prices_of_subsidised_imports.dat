40|$|To {{what extent}} is labour market {{participation}} of mothers sensitive to economic incentives? We answer this question by studying the effect on labour market participation of a Norwegian family policy programme that clearly has affected the incentives {{to participate in the}} labour market of mothers with small children. From January 1999, all parents with one- and two-year-old children who did not use publicly subsidised day-care became entitled to a benefit, 'Cash-for-Care' ('CFC'). The CFC reform has increased the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> publicly <b>subsidised</b> day-care relative to the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> own care. Economic theory of labour market participation postulates that the CFC reform would {{have a negative effect on}} labour market participation for the person most involved in childcare. The results show that the CFC reform has affected mothers' labour market participation negatively. The effects are much stronger for non-western immigrant mothers' than for native mothers. The results support the hypothesis that non-western immigrant mothers do react to changes in the relative <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> childcare and suggests that non-western female immigrants are quite responsive to changes in economic incentives.

From 1997, after criticism from the World Bank that ADMARC was <b>subsidising</b> <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> maize, ADMARC lost responsibility for this, controlling only domestically-produced grain. The Malawi government required it to buy domestic maize at a fixed minimum price to support farmers, and this forced ADMARC to sell its strategic reserve in 1997, and again in 2000 to pay off its commercial loans, creating insecurity.|$|R

40|$|In the {{subsidised housing}} sector, {{building}} corporations {{can use their}} market power as purchasers to raise output <b>of</b> <b>subsidised</b> housing to a level higher than it is with perfect competition {{on both sides of}} the market. This holds true if the building society is perfectly X-efficient, The proposition is not necessarily true if the corporation maximises a utility function in which discretionary profit, or organisational slack, is an argument. The X-inefficient building society may set output higher or lower than with perfect competition. If the government grants a fixed subsidy per house and tries to constrain X-inefficiency by imposing a maximum price, this might be an incentive for the building corporation to maintain a planned shortage <b>of</b> <b>subsidised</b> houses. However, housing shortages will be smaller and welfare possibly greater than it is with perfect competition. The existence of a perfectly competitive non-subsidised housing sector is for the building corporation an incentive to increase strategically the output <b>of</b> <b>subsidised</b> housing and reduce planned shortages; but it does not necessarily eliminate such shortages...|$|R

40|$|The thesis aims to {{illustrate}} how Food Aid, Free Trade Agreements, and Agricultural Dumping are closely related. By drawing the relation between these three seemingly separate issues, a divergent perspective upon the global trading system is exposed. The thesis reaches its outcome by using both macro and micro analyses. Where macro analyses allows the debate {{to have a more}} theoretical nature, the micro analyses of the case study on Agricultural Dumping in Mozambique shows a more practical side of the debate. By the use of these two analytical tools, the thesis illustrates how Agricultural Dumping is a negative effect of Food Aid, enabled through Free Trade Agreements. As open market policies and low domestic protection are part of these agreements, local agricultural markets in sub- Saharan Africa become unable to compete with <b>subsidised</b> <b>imported</b> agricultural goods. Hence, the three issues all contribute to an unequal market system that, in certain situations, provides advantages for the donor country and leaves the receiving country at a disadvantage...|$|R
