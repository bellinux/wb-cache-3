40|$|ABSTRACT: Three {{distinct}} entities are now {{covered by the}} definition of <b>primary</b> <b>pulmonary</b> clonal lymphoid proliferation. The aim of this review is to describe the pathophysiological, diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic aspects of these three entities. Low-grade <b>pulmonary</b> B-cell <b>lymphoma</b> is the most frequent form of <b>primary</b> <b>pulmonary</b> clonal lymphoid proliferation. It arises from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. It is usually indolent and appears {{in the form of}} a chronic alveolar opacity. The prognosis is excellent, but treatment is controversial (simple monitoring, surgery or single-agent chemotherapy). High-grade <b>pulmonary</b> B-cell <b>lymphoma</b> is far rarer and usually occurs in individuals with an underlying disorder (e. g. immunodeficiency). The prognosis is poor and therapeutic options depend on the underlying disorder. The inclusion of lymphomatoid granulomatosis in the definition of <b>primary</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>lymphomas</b> is controversial. The clonal nature of the proliferation is very rarely demonstrated and extrapulmonary involvement is frequent (upper airways, skin, kidneys, central nervous system, etc.).

40|$|AbstractPrimary {{malignant}} lymphomas of {{the lung}} are very rare. Most {{of them are}} extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT type. Primary follicular lymphoma of the lung is extremely rare. A 50 -year-old woman presented with cough and sputum, and consulted to a private hospital, where she was pointed out to have abnormal lung shadow by chest X–P. She was admitted to our hospital for scrutiny. Imaging modalities including CT, MRI, and PET revealed a small (15  mm in diameter) nodule in the right middle lobe beneath the pleura. No other tumors were found by these techniques. A biopsy revealed a lymphoid proliferation. Clinical cytology was negative. A wedge resection with wide margins was performed. Grossly, the resected lung specimen contained a white solid mass measuring 12  ×  13  ×  13  mm. Microscopically, the mass was composed of follicular proliferation of atypical lymphocytes. There were no tingible body macrophages, and normal follicular polarity was absent. Mild infiltrative growth from the surrounding lung was present. Lymphoepithelial lesions were not recognized. The atypical lymphocytes consisted of centrocytes, centroblasts, and small lymphoid cuffs. The centroblasts are seen in 3 – 5 per a high power field. The immunophenotypes were CD 45 +, CD 5 +, CD 10 +, CD 23 +, cyclin D 1 −, CD 20 +, CD 21 +, CD 79 α +, bcl- 2 +, bcl- 6 −, CD 3 −, CD 45 RO −, CD 30 −, CD 15 −, κ-chain +, and λ-chain −.

40|$|AIM: To {{characterize}} {{computed tomography}} (CT) features of <b>primary</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>lymphoma</b> (PPL). METHODS: The CT films of six patients (five men, one woman; 63. 2 ± 14. 5 years) with low grade non-Hodgkins PPL were evaluated for alveolar opacities (lobar consolidation, masses or nodules, and ill-defined consolidations), peribronchial disease or bronchial wall thickening, mediastinal nodes and pleural effusion. RESULTS: Multilobar bilateral, multilobar unilateral, and unilobar unilateral involvement {{were present in}} three, one and two cases respectively. CT features were: ill-defined mainly subpleural consolidations (n = 4), mass-like consolidation (n = 1), lobar consolidation (n = 1), and pleural effusion (n = 1). Minor peribronchial disease was seen in two patients, heterogeneous enhancement in four patients, and CT-angiogram sign in one patient. There were no lymphadenopathy or lung nodules. Although the pleura were inseparable from subpleural disease, pleural enhancement was noted on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of a patient with lobar lymphoma. CONCLUSION: PPL is characterized by ill-defined alveolar opacities that are usually multifocal. Peribronchial disease, proximal bronchiectasis and positive CT-angiogram sign are ancillary features.

40|$|Background: Primary {{pulmonary}} non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma is a {{very rare}} neoplasm. It is repre-sentedmost commonly bymarginal zoneB-cell lymphomaofmucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type. Although {{there have been a}} few reviews of this lymphoma, clinical features, diag-nostic procedure, optimal management and prognostic factors have not been well defined. Methods:We reviewed the medical records of 24 patients who were pathologically and clinically diagnosed as <b>primary</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>lymphoma</b> between September 1995 and June 2003. Results: There were 13 patients with MALT lymphoma and two with MALT lymphoma accom-panied by large B-cell lymphoma, seven with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and two with ana-plastic large cell lymphoma. Half the patients were asymptomatic at presentation; 46 % had respiratory symptoms and 16. 7 % had B-symptoms. Initial radiological findings were variable including nodules, masses, infiltrates or consolidation. The majority of patients (66. 7 %) needed surgical approaches (open thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopy) for definite diagnosis. Bronchoscopy was performed in 83 %, but only 30 % showed a diagnostic yield. The 13 patients with MALT lymphoma were treated with a variety of modalities such as observation, surgery and single or combination chemotherapy, and combination chemotherapy was administered to 11 patientswith non-MALT lymphoma regardless of surgery. Theoverall survival rate at 3 years for all 24 patients was 86 % with a median follow-up of 32 months. Conclusion: Although this entity of lymphoma appears to have a good prognosis, further clinical experience and long-term follow-up are needed to identify prognostic factors.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundMucosa-associated {{lymphoid tissue}} (MALT) lymphoma, a low-grade B-cell extranodal lymphoma, {{is the most}} {{frequent}} subset of <b>primary</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>lymphoma</b> (PPL). It often associates with connective tissue disease (CTD). We aimed to evaluate the impact of concomitant CTD on diagnostic value of flow cytometry and genetic clonality analyses for the diagnostic of MALT lymphoma. MethodsAll chest disease and pathology departments of teaching hospitals in Paris were contacted to identify patients with a histological diagnosis of PPL of the MALT subtype with or without associated CTD. We identified 44 patients in the lymphoma group; 11 had a CTD and were matched to 11 patients with CTD but without lymphoma. ResultsResults of BAL analyses of MALT-PPL showed normal cellularity (370  cells/mm 3 [range 21 – 2300]) but increased proportion of lymphocytes (31. 5 % [80 – 2]) of the B-cell subtype (20 % [1 – 88]). A B-cell clone was detected in 82 % of cases, and specificity of clonality was 90 %. Interestingly, BAL analysis results different by presence or not of a CTD. The frequency of B lymphocyte alveolitis was significantly greater in MALT patients without than with CTD (34 % vs 6. 5 %, p =  0. 007). However, BAL results for patients with CTD did not differ between those with and without lymphoma. ConclusionBAL results may be highly suggestive of pulmonary MALT lymphoma.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Primary</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>lymphoma</b> (PPL) is an {{uncommon}} type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The majority of PPLs are of low-grade, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type. Primary pulmonary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is extremely rare, and prompt diagnosis may be challenging since its clinical symptoms and signs are nonspe-cific. Although the clinical features, diagnostic procedures, optimal management and prognostic factors {{of this disease}} {{have not yet been}} well defined, open thoracotomy and chest computed tomography (CT) -guided percutaneous biopsy are the preferred methods used in previous studies. In the present case report, the diag nosis and management of a patient with primary pulmonary DLBCL is reported. A 68 -year-old patient was admitted to hospital in May 2013, with complaints of shortness of breath and intermittent wheezing and a cough associated with the production of small amounts of phlegm. Following admis sion, chest CT scans revealed a mass in the right middle lobe with ground-glass opacities at the lesion margins, as well as air bronchograms in the areas of consolidation. Bronchoscopy was performed and revealed an endobronchial lesion and partial stenosis in the distal end of the middle segment bronchus. Transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) of the right hilar lymph node, as well as endobron-chial biopsy, was performed. The patient was diagnosed with primary pulmonary DLBCL by subsequent histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis of biopsy specimens collected via TBNA. Following the final diagnosis, standard treatment with CHOP chemotherapy resulted in significant clinical and radiological response and the patient remained in remission 8 months later. These results indicate that TBNA may be an effective method for the diagnosis of primary pulmonary DLBCL...|$|E
