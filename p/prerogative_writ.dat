Hamilton (1795), the Court granted bail to a capital defendant charged with treasonas it was authorized {{to do by}} § 33 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 and § 4 of the Judiciary Act of 1793on an original writ of habeas corpus. The greater portion of the decision was dedicated to the Court's refusal to order the case tried by a special circuit court, as was provided for by § 3 of the Judiciary Act of 1793. Second, in United States v. Lawrence (1795), the Court declined to issue a writ of mandamus to compel a district judge to order the arrest of a deserter of the French navy, as the French government argued to be required by the consular convention between the United States and France.|$|E
25|$|The Waite Court heard two {{criminal}} cases under the <b>prerogative</b> <b>writ</b> of mandamus (habeas corpus {{is also a}} <b>prerogative</b> <b>writ).</b> In Virginia v. Rives (1879), the Court used mandamus to order a {{criminal cases}} removed to federal court under the civil rights removal statute to be remanded back to state court, finding that the statute did not authorize federal jurisdiction because the bar on African-Americans serving on juries was not codified by statute or state constitution. In Ex parte Wall (1883), the Court denied a writ of mandamus, finding that it was proper to remove an attorney who participated in a lynch mob from a case.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the Taney Court, no {{reported}} decision recorded {{an attempt}} by a party to obtain review {{in a criminal case}} by means of a <b>prerogative</b> <b>writ</b> other than habeas corpus.

25|$|Like its predecessor, the Supreme Court of the United States under Chief Justice Roger B. Taney {{exercised}} {{only limited}} appellate jurisdiction in criminal cases.

In addition, unlike its predecessor, the Court heard two writs of error from the territorial courts and three prerogative writs of mandamus and prohibition in criminal matters. The Court denied every petition for a <b>prerogative</b> <b>writ</b> that it received, habeas or otherwise.|$|E

5000|$|At common law, the {{traditional}} remedies are the <b>prerogative</b> <b>writs,</b> {{referred to as}} [...] "constitutional writs" [...] {{in the exercise of}} federal judicial power, — principally certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus, and the former equitable remedies, declarations and injunctions.|$|R
50|$|In common law, a writ is {{a formal}} written order issued by a body with {{administrative}} or judicial jurisdiction; in modern usage, this body is generally a court. Warrants, <b>prerogative</b> <b>writs</b> and subpoenas are common types of writ but many forms exist and have existed.|$|R
50|$|The <b>prerogative</b> <b>writs</b> are a {{means by}} which the Crown, acting through its courts, effects control over {{inferior}} courts or public authorities throughout the kingdom.

40|$|Judicial review now {{accounts}} for over {{one third of the}} applications submitted to the Queen’s Bench Division. Judicial review has ascended to this point of high prominence {{over the course of a}} four hundred year history. That history is the story of the progress since the sixteenth century of the <b>prerogative</b> <b>writs</b> – particularly certiorari and mandamus. Of these <b>prerogative</b> <b>writs,</b> it is certiorari which has the closest connection with the modern process of judicial review. In the early part of its history, from the seventeenth century to the end of the eighteenth century, the writ issued against a wide range of orders made by justices of the peace and specialist agencies like commissioners of sewers. The particular focus of this study is upon its use as a means of invalidating summary convictions...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "prerogative" [...] writs are {{a subset}} of the class of writs, those that are to be heard ahead of any other cases on a court's docket except other such writs. The most common of the other such <b>prerogative</b> <b>writs</b> are habeas corpus, quo warranto, prohibito, mandamus, procedendo, and certiorari.|$|R
2500|$|Also, {{while there}} is no open {{standing}} per se, <b>prerogative</b> <b>writs</b> like certiorari, writ of prohibition, quo warranto and habeas corpus have a low burden in establishing standing. [...] Australian courts also recognise amicus curiae (friend of the court), and the various Attorneys Generals have a presumed standing in administrative law cases.|$|R
5000|$|Quo warranto (Medieval Latin for [...] "by what warrant?") is a <b>prerogative</b> <b>writ</b> {{requiring}} {{the person to}} whom it is directed to show what authority they have for exercising some right or power (or [...] "franchise") they claim to hold.|$|E
50|$|In Anglo-American {{common law}} courts, appellate review of lower court {{decisions}} {{may also be}} obtained by filing a petition for review by <b>prerogative</b> <b>writ</b> in certain cases. There is no corresponding right to a writ in any pure or continental civil law legal systems, though some mixed systems such as Quebec recognize these prerogative writs.|$|E
50|$|The Habeas Corpus Act 1679 is an Act of Parliament in England (31 Cha. 2 c. 2) {{during the}} reign of King Charles II.

50|$|In the Philippines, amparo and habeas {{data are}} <b>prerogative</b> <b>writs</b> to {{supplement}} the inefficacy of the writ of habeas corpus (Rule 102, Revised Rules of Court).

5000|$|The Court has {{a limited}} {{original}} jurisdiction, {{giving it the}} discretion to grant relief {{by way of a}} <b>prerogative</b> <b>writ.</b> [...] The Court has held that since it is primarily a court of appeal, it will only entertain original applications for prerogative relief in extraordinary circumstances.

5000|$|A <b>prerogative</b> <b>writ</b> is a writ (official order) {{directing}} {{the behavior of}} another arm of government, such as an agency, official, or other court.

50|$|Elsewhere, {{including}} the Courts of New York, have replaced mandamus (as {{well as the}} other <b>prerogative</b> <b>writs)</b> with statutory procedures. In New York, this is known as an Article 78 review after the civil procedure law provision that created the relevant procedure. In still other states, such as Illinois, the state court of last resort has original jurisdiction in mandamus actions.|$|R
50|$|As a {{superior}} court of original jurisdiction, it has supervisory jurisdiction over administrative tribunals, exercised by the <b>prerogative</b> <b>writs.</b> It {{also has some}} appellate jurisdiction, hearing appeals from the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan and some administrative bodies.

5000|$|The <b>prerogative</b> <b>writs</b> {{other than}} habeas corpus are {{discretionary}} remedies, {{and have been}} known as prerogative orders in England and Wales since 1938.

It is clear that the one salient distinction which the court in Assa Singh failed to appreciate and distinguish was the fact that persons detained or restricted under the RRE are faced with the violation of their freedom for which the court should pay particular attention.|$|E
50|$|The {{powers to}} review {{administrative}} decisions are usually established by statute, but were originally {{developed from the}} royal <b>prerogative</b> <b>writs</b> of English law, such as the writ of mandamus and the writ of certiorari.

This power is seen as fundamental {{to the power of}} judicial review and an aspect of the independent judiciary.|$|R
5000|$|The {{subpoena}} {{developed as}} a creative writ, the [...] "writ subpoena", from the Court of Chancery. Writs of many kinds formed the essential parts of litigation. The primary function of a writ in the 13th and 14th centuries was to convey the king's commands to his officers and servants. It was irrelevant what the nature of those commands might be. The Register of Writs shows a large variety of writs to be administrative in nature, as opposed to judicial. These former writs acquired the name <b>prerogative</b> <b>writs</b> in the 17th and 18th centuries. <b>Prerogative</b> <b>writs</b> that have survived into modern law are the writ of mandamus and writ of certiorari. The medieval writ of prohibition played {{an important part in}} the conflict between the church and state in England. The writ was also used in the courts of admiralty and local courts. It has survived in relative obscurity in United States law. The writ subpoena began to be attached {{to a wide variety of}} writs in the 14th century. These were an invention of the Court of Equity, which were a part of Chancery. Thus, [...] "subpoena" [...] was a product of the Ecclesiastical Courts in England. The commonest writ from this era was the Praecipe quod reddat ("You are commanded to return misappropriated good or land"). To these were often added the phrase sub poena ("under penalty").|$|R
