40|$|Series {{capacitors}} {{are used}} extensively {{to reduce the}} power transfer impedance of long transmission lines. During times of high current, the capacitors are protected from the build-up of high voltages by spark gaps {{with which they are}} connected in parallel. This non-linearity affects the behaviour of the system as a whole. Firstly, this thesis is concerned with studying the system behaviour. A method of analysing the sub-harmonic resonance condition in which line losses are taken into account is proposed, and it is used to find a power system circuit in which operation changes from harmonic to subharmonic mode when a switch is operated. Also described is a method of achieving a transient stability analysis of a two-machine double-circuit series-compensated transmission system with a fault occurring on one circuit. The results are used to compare the effect of two types of <b>protective</b> <b>spark</b> <b>gap.</b> A transient analysis of a single transmission circuit is described, based upon Bergeron's Method of Characteristics. The spark gap type is shown to be instrumental in distorting current and voltage wave-forms. It is generally assumed that spark gap operation shortens the lifetime of the capacitors which it is protecting. This is investigated and is shown to have some theoretical foundation. Secondly, this thesis is concerned with the problem of finding a suitable distance protection scheme for series compensated lines. A number of possibilities are critically examined by making use of the analysis developed earlier in the thesis. A novel scheme based on definite integrals of relaying current and voltage was selected and a prototype relay was constructed in the laboratory using mostly analogue, but some digital circuits. Laboratory tests on the prototype relay and simulated tests carried out on the digital computer showed that the scheme meets the speed and accuracy requirements of modern protective relay...|$|E

In this {{research}} project the electrical strengthof different natural gases and mixtures was investigated, and {{the aim was to}} finda gas or gas mixture with a natural origin or strongly attaching gases that couldreplace SF 6 (Sulfur Hexafluoride). The gases were tested with breakdown experiments,one of those test was called lightning impulse breakdown test. The mainpart of this project was to investigate triggered <b>spark</b> <b>gaps,</b> which could be used inlightning impulse breakdown test.

50|$|An {{alternative}} construction uses two capacitors connected as a Blumlein generator. Two capacitors {{are connected}} {{so that one}} plate is a common earth, the others are each connected to the <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> electrodes. These capacitors are often constructed from a single layer of printed circuit board, or similar stack of copper foil and thin dielectric. The capacitors are linked through an inductor, a simple air-spaced coil. One capacitor also has a small <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> across it. When HT is applied, the two capacitors are charged slowly, effectively linked by the inductor. When the <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> reaches its triggering voltage, it discharges and quickly reduces that capacitor's voltage to zero. As the discharge is rapid, the inductor acts as an open circuit and so the voltage difference across the transverse <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> (between the two capacitors) rises rapidly until the main <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> discharges, firing the laser.|$|R
40|$|Ignitability of DMSO vapors {{have been}} {{evaluated}} at 664 mm Hg pressure. The minimum temperature at which the DMSO vapors that are in equilibrium with liquid DMSO has been determined using two types of strong ignition sources. This temperature is 172 F for chemical igniters, and 178 F for spark ignition. Numerous tests have been conducted using controlled intensity sparks to define {{the shape of the}} minimum ignition energy curve as a function of temperature. The ignition energies spanned four orders of magnitude (approximately from 20, 000 to 2 mJ) while the DMSO vapor mixture temperature varied from 185 to 207 F. The Sandia Generator was used to simulate worst case electrostatic sparks that can be produced by the human body. Although it was not designed for air discharges, this device had been used by LLNL for 1 mm <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> and the resultant spark energy had been measured to fall within the range from 3. 2 to 8. 8 mJ. CRC tests using this device showed that the minimum ignition temperature strongly depends on the <b>spark</b> <b>gap.</b> The minimum ignition temperature was 207 F at 1 mm <b>spark</b> <b>gap,</b> 203 F at 3 mm <b>spark</b> <b>gap,</b> and 197 F at 6 mm <b>spark</b> <b>gap.</b> This strong dependence on the <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> is believed to be partly due to the changes in the spark energy as the <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> changes...|$|R
50|$|Avalanche diodes {{can replace}} a <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> for stage {{voltages}} less than 500 volts. The charge carriers easily leave the electrodes, so no extra ionisation is needed and jitter is low. The diodes {{also have a}} longer lifetime than <b>spark</b> <b>gaps.</b>|$|R
50|$|Smaller <b>spark</b> <b>gaps</b> {{are often}} used to protect {{sensitive}} electrical or electronic equipment from high-voltage surges. In sophisticated versions of these devices (called gas tube arresters), a small <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> breaks down during an abnormal voltage surge, safely shunting the surge to ground and thereby protecting the equipment. These devices are commonly used for telephone lines as they enter a building; the <b>spark</b> <b>gaps</b> help protect the building and internal telephone circuits {{from the effects of}} lightning strikes. Less sophisticated (and much less expensive) <b>spark</b> <b>gaps</b> are made using modified ceramic capacitors; in these devices, the <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> is simply an air gap sawn between the two lead wires that connect the capacitor to the circuit. A voltage surge causes a spark that jumps from lead wire to lead wire across the gap left by the sawing process. These low-cost devices {{are often used}} to prevent damaging arcs between the elements of the electron gun(s) within a cathode ray tube (CRT).|$|R
50|$|Proper {{performance}} {{depends upon}} selection of capacitor {{and the timing}} of the discharge. Switching times can be improved by doping of the electrodes with radioactive isotopes caesium 137 or nickel 63, and by orienting the <b>spark</b> <b>gaps</b> so that ultraviolet light from a firing <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> switch illuminates the remaining open <b>spark</b> <b>gaps.</b> Insulation of the high voltages produced is often accomplished by immersing the Marx generator in transformer oil or a high pressure dielectric gas such as sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).|$|R

40|$|The <b>spark</b> <b>gap,</b> {{used as a}} {{sound source}} in scale model investigations, has {{advantages}} and disadvantages. One of the advantages is its limited size, which is particularly important for investigations at small scales. Also, the <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> is omnidirectional and can be constructed such that the shape has a negligible influence on the sound field to be measured, for any scale factor. A disadvantage of an excessive discharge is {{the appearance of a}} shockwave. This leads to non-linear effects that make it impossible to acquire reliable impulse responses at small distances from the <b>spark</b> <b>gap.</b> A second disadvantage is the spread in successive separate impulse levels {{as a result of the}} micro-climate near the <b>spark</b> <b>gap.</b> Experiments were performed with a low energy <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> (maximum electrode separation of 8 mm). In these experiments the energy was spread over a longer time interval through the use of spark trains. This allows for high INR values and reliable measurements of sound pressure levels.
