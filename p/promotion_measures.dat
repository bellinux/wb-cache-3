With the influx of a migrant non-Wu-speaking population, the near total conversion of public media and organizations to the exclusive use of Mandarin as well as radical Mandarin <b>promotion</b> <b>measures,</b> the modernization and standardization of or literacy in Wu languages became improbable and left them more prone to Mandarinization. The <b>promotion</b> <b>measures,</b> which at present mostly consist of signs like the one pictured, are primarily aimed at limiting the usage of local dialects in conducting public or administrative affairs, although it, like the smoking ban, is commonly violated and it is not so uncommon to hear people speaking local dialects in a government office or a bank. The usage of local dialects in all other spheres is officially tolerated. Standardization of dialects, however, may be perceived as a precursor to possible regionalism, so this, too, would most likely be deterred. On the other hand, few speakers consider their dialect important enough to be written or standardized. To most speakers, dialects are in essence a wholly oral phenomenon.|$|E

50|$|Statistical {{methods in}} the mobile market {{research}} {{profit from the}} fact that they do not depend on place or time. This means that surveys via mobile phone can be done anywhere and at any time and are therefore much more advantageous compared to surveys via land line phones. Considering that a high amount of participants of the main target groups can not be reached at home at most hours of the day, the chance to get hold of them by mobile phone is much higher.Especially with regard to people under the age of 25 as well as business people, who are often on the way and cannot get hold of easily, the chances of the mobile market research are promising. As most people always carry their mobile phone with them, an immediate transmission of personal impressions of current events, is possible at any time. Thus, the so-called ‘magic moment’ can be captured, which is often very helpful. Surveys concerning product placement and efficiency of sales <b>promotion</b> <b>measures</b> at the point of sale turned out to be perfectly realizable this way. Looking at the topic “Access possibilities to WAP-Surveys” by mobile phone, {{as well as at the}} topic “Getting hold of potential participants”, there are some developments that should be named. The trend towards the increasing distribution of web-enabled mobile phones, and the improved representativity that comes along with it, does still continue: from 2007 to 2008, Nielsen Mobile noticed an increase of the mobile internet usage.With decreasing costs and an improving technology, a further upward tendency can be expected. In addition, the mobile internet usage increases with the rapidly developing distribution of smart phones. According to IM (Mediawork Initiative), already in 2013 more people will log in with their smart phone, than with a PC. Mobile statistics show a high and very fast response rate. As a result of the independency from time and place, answers can be submitted immediately. This also means that results can almost be transmitted in real time. A study from Globalpark shows that approximately 35% of the participants answered a mobile survey within 2 hours. Through the novelty of the form of survey and its playful design, mobile research has a motivating effect on the participants. This applies especially to young, technologically interested male persons. But also iPhone users are considered to be very communicative. As the devices are easy to handle, the users are more likely and more motivated to take part in surveys. A study examining how to best reach mobile respondents published in the Journal Social Science Computer Review underlines the importance of social factors. Especially their subjective belief of how they are seen by significant others, or their intention of how they would like to be seen by significant others seem to play a major role in their mobile phone behavior.|$|E

The objective of this paper covers the investigation of consumer’s attitude towards electric vehicles and their opinion on potential <b>promotion</b> <b>measures</b> {{and its impact on}} market penetration scenarios in different countries. The aforementioned issues were investigated via a European wide online consumer survey. It was designed to identify the awareness of potential consumers of electric cars as well as to discover their attitude towards this new technology. In addition to the picture of potential demand-related obstacles, the consumers were asked to evaluate the suitability of various <b>promotion</b> <b>measures.</b> Finally, the findings were included in an agent based vehicle market model which specifies consumer demand and market supply of electromobility scenarios. The results show that the consumer attitude towards electromobility is rather positive and electric vehicles are generally perceived as environment-friendly and secure. But the high acquisition costs and the uncertainty about the operating costs deter consumers from purchasing an electric car. First results of the inclusion of potential <b>promotion</b> <b>measures</b> such as financial incentives in a scenario based market model show a significant increase of the electric vehicle uptake in Germany. Potential customers have high expectations regarding the comfort and range of an electric vehicle. One of the most important barriers and obstacles for a broad market uptake are the currently high purchase prices for this new technology. Therefore, it seems quite necessary to make electric vehicles from a customer’s standpoint more attractive. From the customer’s perspective a dense network of charging stations and financial measures such as tax and energy cost reductions are vital prerequisites in order to convince them to buy an electric vehicle. Finally, it has been proven within a scenario based market model for Germany that the use of different <b>promotion</b> <b>measures</b> by the national government can enhance the market share of electric vehicles substantially until 2030...|$|E

40|$|Background: People {{working in}} social care {{constitute}} the largest occupational group in Sweden {{and they have}} the highest prevalence of sickness absence. Since sickness absence results in great human and societal costs, there is incentive to develop initiatives to promote health for this group. Previous research about both what measures are effective and how soon effects occur are limited and more knowledge about this is needed. Aim: The overall aim of the thesis was to gain more knowledge about associations between workplace health promotion and employee health, sickness absence, and sickness presence in municipal social care organizations. Method: Four studies were conducted concerning social care organizations and their employees in 60 Swedish municipalities, based on data from registers as well as from surveys to employees, top managers, and policy makers, respectively. A randomized sample of 60 of the 290 municipalities in Sweden and a randomized sample of 15, 871 people employed at least half time throughout 2006 within the social care sector in these 60 municipalities was used. A questionnaire was sent to the employees selected (9270) and 58 % replied (study I-IV). Another questionnaire was sent to top managers who represented the employer in the same 60 municipalities (n= 60) (study II). A third questionnaire was sent to policymakers in the 60 municipalities (study III). Register data was obtained on sickness absence (> 14 days) in 2006 for the 9270 employees and on long-term sickness absence (> 90 days) in 2007 – 2012 for all social service workers in the 60 municipalities. Both cross-sectional (study I–II and IV) and prospective (study III) study designs were used, using individual level data (study IV) and organizational level data (study I-III). Descriptive statistics, bivariate and multiple linear and logistic regression analyses, and structural equation modelling analyses were performed. Results: Organizations that had more favorable employee ratings of individual- and organizational-directed (psychosocial work conditions) workplace health <b>promotion</b> <b>measures</b> had better health and lower sickness absence levels among their employees (study I). Organizational- and individual-directed workplace health <b>promotion</b> <b>measures</b> and employee satisfaction with workplace health <b>promotion</b> <b>measures</b> were associated with better employee health (study II). There was an association between provision of organizational-directed workplace health <b>promotion</b> <b>measures</b> (prevention program) and future lower levels of long-term sickness absence (study III). There were associations present between the use of health profile assessment and fitness activities and a lower odds ratio of being sickness present (study IV).
