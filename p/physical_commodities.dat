40|$|The {{debate on}} whether price {{movements}} in commodity markets {{are determined by}} changes in physical supply and demand fundamentals or by the speculative effects of financial investors seems to find some element of agreement on one particular point: the need for increased transparency and improved information on futures markets and <b>physical</b> <b>commodity</b> markets. This discussion paper provides {{an assessment of the}} current situation with regard to availability of information on <b>physical</b> <b>commodity</b> markets, pointing to some of the existing information gaps and areas for improvement. The paper presents a comprehensive account of the different information sources for <b>physical</b> <b>commodity</b> markets (including their websites), and could therefore be considered a practical information tool in itself, of use to different stakeholders interested in knowing about developments in these markets. ...|$|R

25|$|When the {{deliverable}} asset {{exists in}} plentiful supply, {{or may be}} freely created, then {{the price of a}} futures contract is determined via arbitrage arguments. This is typical for stock index futures, treasury bond futures, and futures on <b>physical</b> <b>commodities</b> when they are in supply (e.g. agricultural crops after the harvest). However, when the deliverable commodity is not in plentiful supply or when it does not yet exist - for example on crops before the harvest or on Eurodollar Futures or Federal funds rate futures (in which the supposed underlying instrument is to be created upon the delivery date) - the futures price cannot be fixed by arbitrage. In this scenario there is only one force setting the price, which is simple supply and demand for the asset in the future, as expressed by supply and demand for the futures contract.|$|E

40|$|The {{international}} policy {{response to the}} fi nancial crisis in the 2000 s has presented an extremely challenging agenda for the energy sector. On the whole, this challenge should be cautiously welcomed. Through these policy initiatives, society is demanding more of the fi nancial services sector in order to rebuild trust and to encourage improved market functioning in years to come. However, the energy sector should rightly look for, and assertively present, unintended consequences where it foresees them, {{as a means of}} constructive response.

2500|$|Austria {{finalized}} its Marshall Plan {{program in}} the end of 1947 and received the first tranche of Marshall Plan aid in March 1948. Heavy industry (or what was left of it) was concentrated around Linz, in the American zone, and in British-occupied Styria. Their products were in high demand in post-war Europe. Naturally, the administrators of the Marshall Plan channeled available financial aid into heavy industry controlled by the American and British forces. American military and political leaders made no secret of their intentions: Geoffrey Keyes said that [...] "we cannot afford to let this key area (Austria) fall under exclusive influence of the Soviet Union." [...] The Marshall Plan was deployed primarily against the Soviet zone but it was not completely excluded: it received 8% of Marshall plan investments (compared to 25% of food and other <b>physical</b> <b>commodities).</b> The Austrian government regarded financial aid to the Soviet zone as a lifeline holding the country together. This was the only case when Marshall Plan funds were distributed in Soviet-occupied territories.|$|E

25|$|Also {{prior to}} the passage of the Act, there were many relaxations to the Glassâ€“Steagall Act. For example, a few years earlier, {{commercial}} Banks were allowed to pursue investment banking, and before that banks were also allowed to begin stock and insurance brokerage. Insurance underwriting was the only main operation they weren't allowed to do, something rarely done by banks even after the passage of the Act. The Act further enacted three provisions that allow for bank holding companies to engage in <b>physical</b> <b>commodity</b> activities. Prior to the enactment of the Act those activities were limited to those that were so closely related to banking to be considered incidental to it.
