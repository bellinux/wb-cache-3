The results confirm that a speed improvement can be achieved at 25 °C by detuning the laser to shorter wavelengths. However, the results also show that a lower direct modulation bandwidth at 85 °C makes the shorter wavelength design less attractive.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{methodology}} termed in situ {{design of experiments}} (ISDOE) which enables rapid response surface design in plasma etch chambers while greatly reducing test wafer necessity. We experimentally demonstrate the ISDOE procedure on two separate systems using different optical real-time monitoring techniques to obtain wafer state data on film thickness and etch-rate estimation during reactive ion etch processes. Using the real-time wafer measurement tools during processing, we quickly obtain input/output (I/O) data to map plasma inputs to wafer outputs at multiple operating points, thereby {{reducing the number of}} test wafers necessary to obtain rich data sets for statistical model building and design of experiments.

40|$|We {{developed}} a physical model for polishing. It {{makes it possible}} to determine physico-chemical processes occurring at contactless chemo-mechanical polishing (CMP) of crystal surfaces. A balance equation for diffusion, convection and chemical flows is used to describe processes that are proceeding in the stationary case. The analytical expressions are obtained that relate polishing rate and surface form for processed material to the physical parameters of the proceeding processes. It was found that macrorelief of the processed surface depends not only on the velocity of polishing plate motion but also on the gap between the <b>processed</b> <b>wafer</b> and polishing plate, as well as active component diffusion in the etching solution. One would expect that, at processing conditions discussed, the surface form is the same for different materials, whatever the active component concentration and chemical reaction constant. The polishing rate substantially depends on the concentration of the etchant active component, chemical reaction, physical properties of sample material and etching liquid. It is shown that the inverse rate of dissolution is the sum of inverse limiting rates of chemical, diffusion and convection stages of the process.

40|$|The {{constant}} pressure on performance improvement in RF processes {{is aimed at}} higher frequencies, less power consumption, and a higher integration level of high quality passives with digital active devices. Although excellent for the fabrication of active devices, it is the silicon substrate as a carrier that is blocking breakthroughs. Since all devices on a silicon wafer have a capacitive coupling to the resistive substrate, {{this results in a}} dissipation of RF energy, poor quality passives, cross-talk, and injection of thermal noise. We have developed a low-cost wafer-scale post-processing technology for transferring circuits, fabricated with standard IC processing, to an alternative substrate, e. g., glass. This technique comprises the gluing of a fully <b>processed</b> <b>wafer,</b> top down, to an alternative carrier followed by either partial or complete removal of the original silicon substrate. This effectively removes the drawbacks of silicon as a circuit carrier and enables the integration of high-quality passive components and eliminates cross-talk between circuit parts. A considerable development effort has brought this technology to a production-ready level of maturity. Batch-to-batch production equipment is now available and the technology and know-how are being licensed.

40|$|This work {{reports on}} {{state-of-the-art}} silicon material characterization by calibrated photoluminescence (PL) imaging. PL imaging techniques {{allow for a}} characterization of a large variety of material properties, ranging from bulk and surface recombination properties of bare silicon ingots, to crystal structure, dopant concentration, and bulk lifetime of silicon wafers up to material limiting impurities. In combination with solar cell simulations, injection-dependent PL imaging of <b>processed</b> <b>wafers</b> provides a method for determining the material's efficiency potential. In this contribution, we present two methods for imaging the concentration of interstitial iron at passivated silicon slices and at unpassivated silicon ingots.

40|$|The {{characterization}} {{and understanding}} of the mechanical response of freestanding nano-objects are of prime interest for fundamental research and for supporting reliability analysis of various Micro- and NanoElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS/NEMS). A versatile on-chip mechanical testing platform has been developed using MEMS-based structures in order to explore the mechanical properties of freestanding nano-objects. These structures take advantage of the mismatch stress present in a long silicon nitride beam to apply a deformation to a specimen beam attached to it owing to the release of the underneath sacrificial layer. The connection between the both beams is ensured by an overlap. At the specimen beam ends, dogbone shapes are located to concentrate the loading where the width is uniform. The in-plane dimensions of both, the actuator and the specimen beams, are varied to induce different strains and stress levels. Then, a large range of deformation {{can be applied to the}} specimen allowing the extraction of the strain-stress curve as well as the creep/relaxation behavior. Thousands of tests can be performed using a single <b>processed</b> <b>wafer</b> making statistical data analysis possible. The specimen stress and strain are extracted from the measured total displacement of the structure after its release using an analytical model based on beam theory. Recently, in order to improve the accuracy of the stress and strain estimation, additional geometrical and material features contributing to the total displacement of the structure have been implemented into the analytical model. These geometrical features are the specimen dogbones, the overlap between the actuator and specimen, and the under etching of the specimen and actuator fixed parts after the structures release. The presence of a stress gradient in the actuator constitutes an additional feature that must be taken into account. 3 D finite elements simulations have been performed to evaluate the improved model precision and to determine what extent these additional features have to be considered or neglected. The technique has been used to study the deformation and fracture of phosphorus-doped polysilicon thin films. Two different film thicknesses have been tested: 240 and 40 nm. The Young’s modulus and the fracture strain have been extracted. For the two film thicknesses, the fracture strain increases with decrease specimen surface area. The thinnest film exhibits the lowest fracture strains. More surprising, post mortem analyses of broken samples reveal a change of fracture mode between the two film thicknesses, from transgranular to intergranular. The fracture strain difference and the fracture mode change observed between the two films thicknesses will be discussed in the light of surface roughness and microstructural characterization using the ACOM-TEM method...|$|E
40|$|In 1964 {{the first}} metal oxide {{semiconductor}} (MOS) integrated circuit (IC) became available. Shortly after in 1965 Gordon Moore predicted {{the pace of the}} device density increase in ICs. His prediction became a self-fulfilling prophecy, which taking advantage of the formal device scaling rules introduced by Robert Dennard in 1974, drove the evolution of the integrated electronic industry. In conventional two dimensional ICs, devices are integrated into a single layer of silicon in what is called the front end of line (FEOL) fabrication. Additional layers on top of the devices serve as inter-dielectric isolating layer and metal interconnects and are fabricated in the back end of line (BEOL) process. Scaling the dimension of devices allows for an increase in device density, improvement on device switching speed and reduction of the cost per device. The conjunction of these benefits drove the industry thus far. Over the past decade further scaling the devices while achieving also an increase in performance and cost benefits became extremely difficult. As the dimensional scaling of complementary MOS (CMOS) devices reaches its limits, three dimensional ICs (3 DICs) are increasingly being considered as a path to achieve higher device densities. 3 DICs offer a way to increase density by using multiple device layers on the same die, reducing the interconnect distance and allowing for a decrease in signal delay. Among different fabrication techniques, monolithic 3 D integration is potentially more cost effective but requires high performance devices, a process compatible with transistor integration in the BEOL stack and needs to deliver a high device density and uniformity in order to be adopted by the very large scale integration (VLSI) industry. This work focuses on a particular laser crystallization technique to achieve monolithic device integration. The technique, called Excimer Laser Crystallization (ELC), makes use of an excimer laser to achieve a large grain polycrystalline thin-film starting from an amorphous layer, allowing integration of high quality thin-film transistors (TFTs). Thus far, the ELC technique has been studied on thin-films typically deposited on top of quartz substrate or Si/SiO₂ wafers. On the other hand state of the art VLSI integration uses more advance BEOL stacks with low-κ material as interlayer dielectrics (ILDs) to passivate the copper (Cu) interconnect lines. This thesis focuses on three different key aspect to enable laser crystallization in the BEOL for device integration: 1. Excimer laser crystallization of amorphous silicon on low-κ dielectric; 2. Excimer laser crystallization of amorphous silicon on BEOL processed wafer; 3. VLSI of TFTs on excimer laser crystallized silicon. The ELC of amorphous silicon on low-κ dielectric is first explored through one dimension (1 D) finite element method (FEM) simulation of the temperature evolution during the laser exposure in two different systems: 1. amorphous silicon deposited on top of SiO₂ dielectric; 2. amorphous silicon deposited on top of low-κ dielectric. Simulations predict that is necessary a lower laser energy for crystallizing the silicon on the low-κ material. Experimental observations confirm the predicted behavior yielding a 35 % lower energy for crystallization of thin-film silicon on top of a low-κ dielectric. Material characterization through defect enhanced SEM micrograph, Raman spectroscopy and XRD analysis shows an equivalent material morphology for the two system with a preferential (111) crystal orientation for the SiO₂ system. Silicon crystallization on BEOL <b>processed</b> <b>wafer</b> is studied through a combination of 1 D FEM simulation and experimental observation on a silicon layer deposited on top of a SiO₂dielectric protecting the underlying damascene Cu structure. 1 D FEM show that during the silicon laser exposure, because of the short pulse width of the laser (30 ns), the heat is retained in the amorphous silicon layer allowing its melting while keeping the temperature of the Cu lines below 320 °C which is a favorable condition for monolithic integration in the BEOL. Further experimental evidences show the ability of crystallizing a-Si on such structure while preserving the physical and electrical properties of the Cu lines. The feasibility of monolithic VLSI 3 D integration is demonstrated through integration of TFTs devices on 200 mm silicon wafers. The integration process and performance of the TFTs device are modeled through technology computer aided design (TCAD) simulations which are used to define the process flow and the fabrication parameters. Characterization of the TFTs over multiple die yield good device performance and uniformity. TFTs characterized with 1. 5 V of supply voltage have a sub-threshold slope down to 79 mV/decade, current density up to 26. 3 μA/μm, a threshold voltage of 0. 23 V, current On/Off ratio above 10 ⁵ and device field effect mobility up to 19. 8 cm²/(V s) for LPCVD-sourced silicon. Furthermore, the Levinson method allows characterization of the trap density in the thin-film polysilicon devices yielding a mean value 8. 13 × 10 ¹² cm². This work present an integration scheme which proves to be compatible with VLSI in the BEOL of wafers. It paves the way to further development which could lead to an high performance, cost effective, monolithic 3 D integration approach useful in application such as reconfigurable logic, display, heterogeneous integration and on chip optical communications...|$|E
