I had that night some of the garrison abroad. They met with this Geordie and his fellowes, driving of cattle before them. The garrison set upon them, and with a shott killed Geordie Bourne's unckle, and hee himselfe bravely resisting till he was sore hurt in the head, was taken. After hee was taken, his pride was such, as hee asked, who it was that durst avow that nightes worke? but when hee heard it was the garrison, he was then more quiet. But so <b>powerfull</b> and awfull was this Sir Robert Kerr, and his favourites, as there was not a gentleman in all the east march that durst offend them. Presently after hee was taken, I had most of the gentlemen of the march come to mee, and told mee, that now I had the ball at my foote, and might bring Sir Robert Kerr to what conditions I pleased; for that this man's life was so neere and deare unto him, as I should have all that my heart could desire, for the good and quiet of the country and myselfe, if upon any condition I would give him his life. I heard them and their reasons; notwithstanding, I called a jury the next morning, and hee was found guilty of MARCH TREASON. Then they feared that I would cause him to be executed that afternoone, which made them come flocking to mee, humbly entreating mee, that I would spare his life till the next day, and if Sir Robert Kerr came not himselfe to mee, and made mee not such proffers, as I could not but accept, that then I should do with him what I pleased. And further, they told mee plainly, that if I should execute him, before I had heard from Sir Robert Kerr, they must be forced to quitt their houses and fly the country; for his fury would be such, against mee and the march I commanded, as hee would use all his power and strength to the utter destruction of the east march. They were so earnest with mee, that I gave them my word hee should not dye that day. There was post upon post sent to Sir Robert Kerr, and some of them rode to him themselves, to advertise him in what danger Geordie Bourne was; how he was condemned, and should have been executed that afternoone, but, by their humble suite, I gave them my word, that he should not dye that day; and therefore besought him, that hee would send to mee, with all the speede hee could, to let mee know, that hee would be the next day with mee to offer mee good conditions for the safety of his life. When all things were quiet, and the watch set at night, after supper, about ten of the clock, I tooke one of my men's liveryes, and putt it about mee, and tooke two other of my servants with mee in their liveryes, and we three, as the warden's men, came to the provost marshall's, where Bourne was, and were lett into his chamber. Wee sate down by him, and told him, that wee were desirous to see him, because wee heard hee was stoute and valiant, and true to his friend; and that wee were sorry our master could not be moved to save his life. He voluntarily of himselfe said, that hee had lived long enough to do so many villainies as hee had done; and withal told us, that hee had layne with about forty men's wives, what in England, what in Scotland; and that hee had killed seven Englishmen with his own hands, cruelly murthering them: that hee had spent his whole time in whoreing, drinking, stealing, and taking deep revenge for slight offences. Hee seemed to be very penitent, and much desired a minister for the comfort of his soule. Wee promised him to lett our master know his desire, who, wee knew, would presently grant it. Wee tooke our leaves of him, and presently I tooke order, that Mr. Selby, a very worthy honest preacher, should go to him, and not stirre from him till his execution the next morning; for, after I had heard his own confession, I was resolved no conditions should save his life: and so tooke order, that at the gates opening the next morning, hee should be carried to execution, which accordingly was performed. The next morning I had one from Sir Robert Kerr for a parley, who was within two miles staying for mee. I sent him word, [...] "I would meet him where hee pleased, but I would first know upon what termes and conditions." [...] Before his man was retourned, hee had heard, that in the morning, very early, Geordie Bourne had been executed. Many vowes hee made of cruell revenge, and retourned home full of griefe and disdaine, and, from that time forward still plotted revenge. Hee knew the gentlemen of the country were altogether sacklesse, and to make open road upon the march would but shew his malice, and lay him open to the punishment due to such offences. But his practice was how to be revenged on mee, or some of mine.|$|E

Translated to many languages, the Report had been discussed among experts from many countries for 12 months until it was introduced. A document synthesizing a big mass of information emerged in conclusion. In the report, five trends about global information environment including information, education, privacy, civil participation and technological change were taken into consideration. The Report was introduced in Turkey by IFLA President Sinikka Spilä at the meeting titled “NGO Cooperation in Librarianship: <b>Powerfull</b> Associations, <b>Powerfull</b> Communities” organized {{with the cooperation of}} ANKOS (Anatolian University Libraries Consortium) and TKD (Turkish Librarians Association) on June 3, 2014 at Kadir Has University...|$|E

To investigate underlying interactions between food ingredients and genes simple models, such as {{the red flour beetle}} Tribolium castaneum, appear especially constructive. Here we show that 1...|$|E

40|$|Power is {{the core}} of Hobbes' {{analytical}} device. He defines it as a actual capacity to obtain an apparent good in the future and analyses it, from a nominalist point of view, as power of a man on another man. For Hobbes, power's returns are increasing, the research of power has no other limits than death and if men accumulate powers, it is to try to get rid of their fear. They are many kinds of power, but the greatest is to constitute around oneself a coalition of <b>powerfull</b> men, an Union. But how? Hobbes questions the existence of a power market. However, if a man increases his power by buying the power of other men, he also strengthens it while submitting oneself to a <b>powerfull</b> man. So, we understand why men subject themselves: they win in terms of power. ...|$|E
