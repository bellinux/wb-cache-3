The angle between magnetic and <b>grid</b> <b>meridians</b> is called <b>grid</b> magnetic angle, grid variation, or grivation.” ...|$|R
5000|$|... 167 Avenue is the {{designated}} name {{of two major}} arterial roads in north Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, separated by the Castle Downs neighbourhood. It {{used to be a}} rural grid road, and as the city expanded the road has been widened where traffic volume has increased. As 167 Avenue runs east, the city runs out of street numbers at rural <b>grid</b> road <b>Meridian</b> (1) Street, so a quadrant system has been put in place by increasing the numbers again in the NE quadrant. Addresses on 33 Street and east have been encouraged to include NW to avoid confusion with addresses in the NE quadrant.|$|R

Part of this work is a theory {{of searching for}} Mersenne primes and historical methods of searching for such numbers, GIMPS project description and its results, Grid Computing technology explanation, and Grid Computing capabilities of Mathematica 7 software for searching for Mersenne primes...|$|R
5000|$|Born in {{a family}} of the lesser nobility, he {{graduated}} from the Saint Petersburg Naval Academy and later found employment there. During the Seven Years' War Nagayev headed the hydrographic expedition to the Prussian shores. He also compiled the first atlases of the Bering Sea and Baltic Sea, which were published in 1752. Despite the absence of a <b>meridian</b> <b>grid,</b> Nagayev's maps were used for a further fifty years. In 1764-65 Nagayev became the supreme commander of the Kronstadt port. He was promoted to the rank of admiral in 1769.|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} we present an off-the-number-line {{representation}} of the positive integers by expressing each integer by its unique prime signature as a grid point of an infinite dimensional space indexed by the prime numbers, which we term the <b>prime</b> <b>grid.</b> In this space we consider a zigzag line, termed the number trail that starts at the origin (representing 1) and travels through every single grid point {{in the order of}} the increasing sequence of the natural numbers. Using the infinity norm we define an arithmetic function L_∞ (N) tabulating the total length of the zigzag up to the integer N. We show that L_∞(N) grows linearly in N. Based on computing L_∞ up to N= 10 ^ 12 we conjecture the exact rate of growth, which we substantiate analytically by constructing a series of Markov shifts that give gradually better approximations. Our other interest is looking at the prime gaps along L_∞, i. e. the differences L_∞ (p_i+ 1) -L_∞ (p_i) between every two consecutive primes. After some preliminary observations we extend this analysis to second order differences (difference of differences) as well. Based on our computations up to N= 10 ^ 12 we conclude that the distribution of prime numbers along the number trail shows a considerably richer structure compared to their distribution on the traditional number line. We also formulate modified versions of the prime number theorem and Polignac's conjecture. Comment: 19 pages + Appendix, 5 figures, 8 table...|$|R
50|$|If {{the same}} program or episode was {{scheduled}} to air in the same timeslot {{on more than one}} channel, two or more bullets identifying each channel would precede the program title listed in a particular time entry. The usage of multiple bullets to denote stations airing {{the same program}} was a more common occurrence in instances where multiple broadcast stations aired the same network program or their respective local news programs at the same time, although this also applied to broadcast and/or cable channels carrying the same episode of a syndicated program; separate time entries would only be used in this situation if the program had differing running times between channels (the grouping of bullets based on a station's affiliated network was later applied to the <b>prime</b> time <b>grids</b> beginning in September 2003).|$|R
50|$|The western {{extension}} did {{not have}} the same quirks as the first survey since the solar compass had made it easier to make accurate east-west surveys. However the quirks of the eastern portion of the Sullivan Line were to stir passions as Iowa prepared to enter the Union. Missouri, citing evidence from surveyor Joseph C. Brown, who had established the <b>meridian</b> <b>grid</b> for the Louisiana Purchase, said using the Kaw Point starting point was invalid and that the survey should have been based on the mouth of the Ohio River. Using that calculation, he said that Missouri’s border should extend about 9.5 miles even further into Iowa (with the town of Keosauqua, Iowa, specifically coming into play).|$|R
5000|$|For the magazine's first 52 {{years of}} publication, listings {{information}} was {{displayed in a}} [...] "log" [...] format, a mainly text-based list of programs organized by both start time and channel, which was the sole method - eventually, primary once <b>prime</b> time <b>grids</b> were incorporated, and later secondary for the final two years of its inclusion of local listings - of displaying program information in TV Guide until the switch to national listings in 2005; this allowed for the display of full titles for each program {{as well as the}} inclusion of synopses for movies and most programs. Most listing entries in the log included program genres (and for national news programs, anchors) after the program's title, while its running time (which was mentioned only if a program lasted a minimum of one hour - later 35 minutes - in length) was listed in the synopses.|$|R
40|$|A data grid is a {{collection}} of geographically dispersed storage resources over wide area network. The goal of data grid system is to provide a large virtual storage framework with unlimited power through collaboration among individuals, institutions, and resources. In this study, we first review a number of data grid services such as, to just name a few, metadata service, data access service, and performance measurement service. We then investigate various techniques for boosting the performance of data grid, and these key techniques have fallen into three camps, namely, data replication, scheduling, and data movement. Since security issue becomes one of the <b>prime</b> concerns in <b>grid</b> computing, we review two interesting issues of security in data grid. Finally and importantly, we have identified five interesting open issues, and pointed out some potential solutions to the open problems...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} a popular narrow band power line communication (PLC) solution (referred to as PoweRline Intelligent Metering Evolution or <b>PRIME)</b> for smart <b>grid</b> applications in an impulsive noise environment. To this end, we analyze the effects of the impulsive noise in narrow band PLC systems and derive an explicit formula of bit error rate (BER) and its upper bound for an uncoded and coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) schemes in PRIME, respectively. Our analyses and the upper bound are then validated using simulation. Furthermore, we propose an efficient time domain interleaver (TDI) technique to improve the performance of the PRIME by spreading the effect of impulsive bursts over a large number of OFDM symbols. Our simulation results show that the TDI method significantly reduces the impact of impulsive noises on the BER of the PRIME solution...|$|R
5000|$|Because most {{cable systems}} {{published}} their own listing magazine reflecting their channel lineup, and {{now had a}} separate guide channel or an electronic program guide that can be activated by remote and provide the same information in a more detailed manner - with additional competition coming in the late 1990s from websites that also specialize in providing detailed television program information (such as TVGuide.com, then jointly operated with TV Guide Magazine, and Zap2It), a printed listing of programming in a separate magazine became less valuable. The sheer amount and diversity of cable television programming made it hard for TV Guide to provide listings of the extensive array of programming that came directly over the cable system. TV Guide also could not match {{the ability of the}} cable box to store personalized listings. Nevertheless, beginning with the September 12, 1998 issue, the magazine added several new channels to many of its editions, including those that had previously been mentioned only in a foreword on the channel lineup page as well as those that were available mainly on digital cable and satellite; although most of these newly added channels were placed within the <b>prime</b> time <b>grids,</b> only a few (such as Animal Planet and MSNBC) were also incorporated into the log listings. Some of the channels that were added to the grids beginning with the expansion were identified by four character abbreviations (such as [...] "BBCA" [...] for BBC America and [...] "HBOS" [...] for HBO Signature).|$|R
5000|$|Other {{changes were}} made to the {{magazine}} beginning with the June 21 issue in select markets and the 2003 [...] "Fall Preview" [...] issue elsewhere. A half-page daily prime time highlights section featuring the evening's notable shows, movies and sports events - similar to the former [...] "Guidelines" [...] feature - was re-added to the listings section; a full-page [...] "Weekday Highlights" [...] page was also added featuring guest and topical information for the week's daytime talk and morning shows as well as picks for movies airing during the day on broadcast and cable channels. In addition, while log listings continued in use for prime time listings, program synopses were added to the grids and log, as well as a [...] "NEW" [...] indicator for first-run episodes, replacing the [...] "(Repeat)" [...] indicator in the log's synopses. The [...] "Premium Channels Movie Guide" [...] was also restructured as [...] "The Big Movie Guide," [...] with film listings being expanded to include those airing on all broadcast networks and cable channels featured in each edition (as well as some that were not listed in a particular local edition), as well as movies that were available on pay-per-view (page references to the films included in this section were also incorporated into the <b>prime</b> time <b>grids</b> and log listings). Beginning in January 2004, the midnight to 5:00 a.m. listings (as well as the Saturday and Sunday 5:00 to 8:00 a.m. listings) ceased to include any broadcast stations outside of the edition's home market, leaving only program information for stations within the home market and for cable channels.|$|R
