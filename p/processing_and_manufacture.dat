40|$|The {{polymers}} used in plastics {{are generally}} harmless. However, {{they are rarely}} used in pure form. In almost all commercial plastics, they are "compounded" with monomeric ingredients to improve their processing and end-use performance. In order of total volume used, these monomeric additives may be classified as follows: reinforcing fibers, fillers, and coupling agents; plasticizers; colorants; stabilizers (halogen stabilizers, antioxidants, ultraviolet absorbers, and biological preservatives); processing aids (lubricants, others, and flow controls); flame retardants, peroxides; and antistats. Some information is already available, and much more is needed, on potential toxicity and safe handling of these additives during <b>processing</b> <b>and</b> <b>manufacture</b> of plastics products...|$|E

30|$|There {{is little}} or no doubt that {{nanoparticles}} have tremendous market potentials, but as a replacement for current EOR chemicals and in the creation of new market through their outstanding properties. But the challenge is the <b>processing</b> <b>and</b> <b>manufacture</b> technology in terms of quantity and commercialization is the greatest challenge. The dispersion of nanoparticles or the chemical compatibility of the nanoparticle with the material is important. The homogenous dispersion of the nanoparticles in polymer is very difficult due to the strong tendency of particles to agglomerate [178, 179]. Scale up is needed to produce large quantities of nanomaterials for manufacturing purposes, there is need for characterization method, tools, instrumentation as well as affordable infrastructure, and the education of scientist and engineers in academics and industry. Molecular dynamics simulation and theoretical analysis are based on assumption that may not be feasible in real life situation [180].|$|E
