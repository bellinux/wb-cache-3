40|$|This paper {{argues that}} those who emphasise that {{designers}} and engineers need to <b>plan</b> for <b>obsolescence</b> are too conservative. Rather, in addition to <b>planning</b> for <b>obsolescence,</b> designers and engineers should also think carefully about {{what they could do}} in order delay obsolescence. They should so this by thinking about the design itself, thinking of ways in which products could be useful and appealing for longer before becoming obsolete, as well thinking about the wider context in terms of the marketing of products, and also the social and legal. The paper also considers objections that these suggestions are unrealistically idealistic, failing to recognise the economic realities. I respond to these objections appealing to research in advertising, psychology, cognitive linguistics, philosophy, history, and economics, as well as drawing on the Statement of Ethical Principles developed by the Royal Academy of Engineering and the Engineering Council...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Planned</b> {{systemic}} <b>obsolescence</b> is {{the deliberate}} {{attempt to make}} a product obsolete by altering the system {{in which it is}} used {{in such a way as}} to make its continued use difficult. Common examples of <b>planned</b> systemic <b>obsolescence</b> include not accommodating forward compatibility in software, or routinely changing screws or fasteners so that they cannot easily be operated on with existing tools. Another example of a company that practices this is Apple Inc. “Apple designs the new operating systems, which have more features, take up more space and require more computing power, for the new iPhones. In order for those apps to remain relevant and keep working, developers have to update them to work with Apple’s latest software and hardware.” [...] Apple constantly urges app designers to produce apps that are suited with the newest created operating system. The software old iPhones obtain purposely lack compatibility with new iPhone software, preventing the user from successfully upgrading their phone.|$|R

25|$|Because of {{the toxic}} {{materials}} used {{in the production of}} modern computers, obsolescence, if not properly managed, may lead to harmful environmental impacts.

Numerical examples are also presented to demonstrate this production planning problem for remanufactured products using mixed integer programming optimisation.

Johnston) *** This study identifies strategic {{solutions to}} the problems Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) product obsolescence creates for defense contractors and the programs they support. COTS products allow defense contractors to design systems at much lower initial costs by leveraging COTS products created for a larger consumer market, but Total Ownership Costs (TOC) can end up being much larger than expected if carefullifecycle <b>obsolescence</b> <b>planning</b> does not take place (Enslen & Doray, 2002). COTS obsolescence is a significant problem for defense contractors as most COTS products have two to three year life spans while defense programs have significantly longer life spans of 20 - 30 years (Edwards, 2009). While there is no one solve-all solution to this problem, there are several strategies defense contractors, such as Company XYZ, can take advantage of to minimize the negative impacts of COTS obsolescence to cost and schedule. In this study, 3 several strategies will be collected through reviewed literature involving the topic of COTS obsolescence. The Company XYZ common procedure titled "Life cycle Obsolescence Management " (2009) will be analyzed to determine if the strategies collected through the other literature reviewed are included in the common procedure. The ultimate goal is to identify possible strategies missing from the Company XYZ "Lifecycle Obsolescence Management " common procedure that should be further investigated for possible future inclusion. ...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays it is {{increasingly}} significant that under the oligopolistic structure of market business management tends to be operated centering and resting on marketing. Marketing management contributes much for business ranging from designing of optical marketing mixes to major objective of whole business, namely maximization of expected profits in long range. Such contributions made by marketing management are apparent and can never be denied. But we {{want to suggest that}} these contributions can be realized not merely because of the progress of data processing and calculating techniques to be utilized for solution of marketing problems, nor because of the application of the methods of OR and LP to formation of marketing mixes, but also {{because of the fact that}} the marketing mixes thus formed maintain organic connections with whole business system which imply an well balanced interrelation with other functions of business system, such as production, finance, personnel and so on. As a focal point of business activities, marketing management marketing mix-has to satisfy the demands of other functional divisions in the firm, to utilize all their abilities, and to co-ordinate them systematically, from the viewpoint of total profit objective. In this article, we will review the co-ordinative function performed by marketing management in the whole business system, and make clear concretely by what marketing activity such a function may be most effectively fulfilled, and then we seek the functional foundation of the ability of marketing to solve essential business problems. As a course of discussion, we take up firstly the appearance and evolution of managerial marketing. In a market under oligopolistic competition, marketing comes into exist in its true characteristics as a key-role of business activities. For so-called quality competition-competition through speedy innovation in production or engineering on the basis of Customer orientation-has become the typical form of competitive business behaviors. Among the problems relevant to quality competition, the most important may be in development of new products, products diversification and <b>plans</b> on <b>obsolescence.</b> In order to solve these decisive problems, to use effectively current resources of a firm, and to secure future investments, top-management of the firm should work out over-all plans on the whole business activities in accordance with marketing. In this way, marketing which is combined directly with or planned by top-management-managerial marketing-may perform an integrative and co-ordinative function for the total business system and come to be the basis of the whole business activities. To understand more clearly the co-ordinative function of marketing in business, it is extremely important that we make use of the Systems Approach. In this-approach marketing must be conceived in two ways; first it stands as an independent system composed of all marketing activities-marketing research, product planning, sales promotion, advertising, pricing, personal selling, distribution channels and physical distribution-; second it belongs as an independent subsystem to the whole business system which includes all of the functional departments of the firm other than marketing-production, finance, personnel and so on. In the latter setting, marketing is considered not only as a component of the whole business system but also as a basic activity which integrates and co-ordinates other functional activities. If we recognize that the ultimate objective of a firm is in the maximization of profit, and that this objective can only be attained through an effective combination of the firm's present and future resources and measures to follow carefully consumer orientation, we find also that business firm must be an orderly whole-system-having marketing as the main co-ordinator. Applying the Systems Approach, the need for managerial marketing in modern business management may be more positively proved. In the light of the Systems Approach, interactions and interconnections between functional divisions are expressed not in terms of coercion but of negotiation. This stems from the fundamental principle of business system which lay emphasis on total profit as the primary objective and the optimal mix as the way to reach it for the components of total business system. Thus, from the viewpoint of the Systems Approach, we can see that when business activities are integrated around marketing, this integration should be performed on a sound basis or by sound process, and we can recognize that the function which marketing has for the whole business sytem is a sound co-ordination. Such a co-ordinative function of marketing is performed mainly by a kind of marketing activity; that is product planning. We demonstrate this by following the experience of Westinghouse Electric Corporation, one of the biggest electric companies in the U. S [...] As a conclusive statement, we may line up as follows: 1. Competition between firms on a condition of oligopoly takes form of quality competition based upon dynamic consumer demands and innovation on the side of the firms. 2. Marketing which reflects instantly movements of consumer demands is emphasized more than production process. 3. Rapidly changing and expanding consumer demands and innovation of production and marketing techniques are remarkably shortening the life of existing products and enforcing introduction of a great many kinds of new products into market. 4. Effective use of resources of firm and co-ordinate combination of them are critical points for such a situation, and as far as a firm holds consumer orientation as its essential philosophy, this combination ot resources must be done through a line of top marketing managements. 5. Co-ordinative function to be performed by managerial marketing is concentrically born by product planning, because the tasks of product planning such, as development of new products, diversification of products and <b>planned</b> product <b>obsolescence,</b> can not be achieved at all within a single functional division. Top management should regard the problem of products as the central point of a business, and in such a case products must be developed as the result of effective co-ordination of resources available for the firm. That co-ordination extends from consumer to ultimate goal of profit maximization. Thus there is drawn something like the following scheme. "CONSUMER-PRODUCT PLANNING-MARKETING-PRODUCTION ACCOMPLISHMENT OF BUSINESS OBJECTIVES" 6. Thus, it is recognized that product planning as the core of marketing performs properly the function to co-ordinate entire business activities. 7. Finally, we can claim that since managerial marketing, or product planning as the central core of it, co-ordinates whole business activities generally and integratively; the marketing mixes which are formed up can serve really to solve the problems of business enterprise. Therefore the co-ordinative function performed by managerial marketing-product planning-will set an essential foundation to the ability of, marketing in solving concrete business problems. Note on the final conclusion, There is recognized another functional area within marketing which performs properly the co-ordination other than product planning. That is the area of inventory control. Having no room to discuss it now, we only point put the existence of the problem and notify beforehand that some explanations will begiven in the near future...|$|R

2500|$|Fitzpatrick {{starts the}} book by {{deconstructing}} {{one of the most}} important steps in the academic publication process - peer review. Drawing on a wide-ranging history of and problems in the process of academic peer review, she argues that much of the peer review process is about credentialing rather than about encouraging good ideas. Digital technologies allow for a review process that is more in-line with promoting good ideas: [...] "putting them on the digital table, welcoming diverse attitudes toward them, selecting, shaping and reconfiguring them “curatorially” in imaginative response to freely offered and serious opinions". Keeping this in mind, Fitzpatrick offers a new model for peer review - 'peer-to-peer review'. She uses MediaCommons as an example of a community-filtered web platform that can function as a site to comment on a draft of scholarly work. On such an online platform, authors can post a draft manuscript and invite comments from their peers or the public, or both. <b>Planned</b> <b>Obsolescence</b> itself was posted on MediaCommons Press as a draft and comments were invited from the general public.|$|E

50|$|While <b>planned</b> <b>obsolescence</b> is {{appealing}} to producers, {{it can also}} do significant harm to the society {{in the form of}} negative externalities.

Even when <b>planned</b> <b>obsolescence</b> might help to save scarce resources per unit produced, it tends to increase output in aggregate, since due to laws of supply and demand decreases in cost and price will eventually result in increases in demand and consumption.

50|$|<b>Planned</b> <b>obsolescence</b> {{tends to}} work best when a {{producer}} {{has at least}} an oligopoly.

In these cases of <b>planned</b> <b>obsolescence,</b> there is an information asymmetry between the producer - who knows how long the product was designed to last - and the consumer, who does not. When a market becomes more competitive, product lifespans tend to increase.
