50|$|The {{most common}} kind of offset {{printing}} {{is derived from}} the <b>photo</b> <b>offset</b> process, which involves using light-sensitive chemicals and photographic techniques to transfer images and type from original materials to printing plates. In current use, original materials may be an actual photographic print and typeset text. However, it is more common—with the prevalence of computers and digital images—that the source material exists only as data in a digital publishing system.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} the recent {{activity of the}} Cayambe-Afiladores-Sibundoy Fault (CASF) and recognise {{it as one of}} the major potential active structures of northwestern South America, based on field observations, stereoscopic aerial <b>photos</b> of <b>offset</b> late Pleistocene-Holocene deposits and landforms, and crustal seismic activity. The CASF runs for at least 270 km along the sub-Andean zone of northern Ecuador and southern Colombia. We measured systematic latest Pleistocene-Holocene right-lateral strike-slip motion and right-lateral reverse motion consistent with earthquake focal mechanism solutions, and estimated a 7. 7 +/- 0. 4 to 11. 9 +/- 0. 7 mm/yr slip-rate. Magnitudes of the earthquakes that could be generated by possible fault-segment reactivation range up to M 7. 0 +/- 0. 1. The CASF should be considered as a major source of possible future large magnitude earthquakes, presenting a seismic hazard for the densely populated regions to the west. The CASF is part of the tectonic boundary of the North Andean block escaping NNE-wards with respect to the stable South American plate...|$|R

Issues were sold by mail order and at movie conventions, and sold out quickly. Encouraged by the response, Valley (as editor, with colleague Jessie Lilley as publisher) continued producing issues on a semi-regular basis.|$|E

However, the paper faced increasing deficits and Cloud eventually sold it to Amphlett Printing Company, the owners of the The San Mateo Times, in 1968. To cut costs, Amphlett cut staff and eventually moved the offices and publishing facilities from Angus Avenue to a central facility on San Mateo Avenue in South San Francisco, where the Herald shared offices with weekly newspapers serving Daly City and South San Francisco.|$|E

She attended Concord High School, where she was valedictorian and won eight academic awards including an academic scholarship to Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts.

50|$|Born in Newport, Rhode Island, Benson began {{teaching}} photography at Yale University in 1979 and was {{dean of the}} Yale School of Art from 1996 to 2006. Benson had {{a broad range of}} interests in the photographic print: silver, platinum, palladium, and ink. Working in these different mediums, sometimes learning forgotten crafts and sometimes creating new ones, by the 1970s he was convinced that ink and the modern <b>photo</b> <b>offset</b> press - with its ability to make multiple passes that build an image from multiple layers of ink - possessed a potential for photographic rendition beyond anything else previously known. By the 1990s he began working on the relationship between the computer and traditional photographic imagery, and applied the lessons from this in the production of long-run offset books of work by different photographers, in both black and white and color.|$|E

50|$|Kaja Renkas {{is part of}} {{the long}} {{tradition}} of Polish poster artists. After receiving her doctorate she moved into an area of poster creation loosely based around surrealistic collage, working in the digital environment and utilising software such as Photoshop, though incorporating found and real objects and images which were scanned into the computer. The art of Kaja Renkas is, broadly speaking, in the European Surrealism tradition. Her work is unique {{in the manner in which}} art historical influences are presented, extending beyond the simple Surrealist catch-all. Like the German Dada and Surrealist artist Max Ernst, Renkas uses collage to create multi-layered images which are modern in their use of antiquities such as old photographs. The work of Australian artist Martin Sharp during the 1960s and even the American member of Monty Python, Terry Gilliam, from the following decade comes to mind when viewing one of Renkas' posters, with all four engaging in a crazed, colourful and ultimately satirical use of Surrealist collage, arising, in part, from the intellectual anarchy of Dada and related early twentieth century movements. Dismembered limbs, bodies, flesh and mechanical contraptions are placed in a phantasmagorical landscape which is neither dream nor nightmare. The art of Kaja Renkas is noteworthy for this very fact, namely, that it can, in a single instance, be familiar yet fresh, welcoming yet inexplicable, and beautiful while at the same time disturbing, though never grotesque. It presents a late nineteenth century, pre World War II sensibility, reflecting the recent rise of Steampunk and renewed affection for an era when humanity was not yet a slave to technology. The disconnect between nature and machine was real. The body and the artefact, or mechanical device, are therefore, in the art of Kaja Renkas, mere pieces in a jigsaw of the mind. Apart from posters - largely produced by the machine-based <b>photo</b> <b>offset</b> lithographic process, and on occasion by manual silk screen printing - Renkas has also applied her graphic design skills and artistry to published material such as postcards, calendars, videos and books, includings catalogues, along with traditional painting and the application of her print designs to fabrics.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} the only {{complete}} and unabridged English translation of Stepan Petrovich Krasheninnikov’s Opisanie Zemli Kamchatki (The Description of the Land of Kamchatka), first published in 1755 by the Imperial Russian Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg. Krasheninnikov (1711 - 1755) {{was a member of}} the Second Bering Expedition (1733 - 1741), one of the most ambitious scientific expeditions of any age. Its purpose was sixfold: 1) to explore and map Siberia; 2) to establish whether Asia and America were separated by water; 3) to explore Kamchatka; 4) to chart all waters between Kamchatka, America and Japan; 5) to map the entire Arctic coast from the White Sea around to the mouth of the Kamchatka River; 6) to explore the northwest coast of America. Krasheninnikov, a young Russian student when the explorations began, was assigned to assist the distinguished expedition scientists from the Academy of Sciences. As the years went by and his abilities became manifest he was assigned the responsibility of exploring and describing Kamchatka. Still in his mid-twenties, he walked, worked and recorded three and a half years of scientific notes about this still forbidding land. He included detailed descriptions of the geography and natural history of Kamchatka, ethnographic studies of the native tribes and their language, customs, appearance, beliefs and way of life, and the history of Kamchatka from the first Russian penetration late in the seventeenth century. His work is a great scientific tour de force which remains the classic treatise on Kamchatka. Although Opisanie Zemli Kamchatki has been published several times in Russia and has been translated into German and French, the only previous English translation is an interesting but very free and drastically abridged version by James Grieve, a Scottish physician in Russian service, which was published in London in 1764 and reissued by <b>photo</b> <b>offset</b> in Chicago in 1962. The present annotated translation includes an introduction which gives some background on Russian eastward expansion, the fur trade, and the two Bering expeditions. A bibliography is appended...|$|E
