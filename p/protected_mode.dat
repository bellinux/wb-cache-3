In its successor 80386 chip, Intel enhanced the <b>protected</b> <b>mode</b> to address more memory and also added the separate virtual 8086 mode, a mode within <b>protected</b> <b>mode</b> with much better MS-DOS compatibility, in order to satisfy the diverging needs of the market.|$|E
25|$|The latest DOS {{extension}} is DOS <b>Protected</b> <b>Mode</b> Interface (DPMI), a {{more advanced}} version of XMS which provided many of {{the services of a}} modern kernel, obviating the need to write a custom kernel.

50|$|In {{computer}} systems programming, an interrupt handler, {{also known as}} an interrupt service routine or ISR, is a special block of code associated with a specific interrupt condition.

50|$|A {{bit in the}} CPUID {{extended}} attributes field informs {{programs in}} real or <b>protected</b> <b>modes</b> if the processor can go to long mode, which allows a program to detect an x86-64 processor. This {{is similar to the}} CPUID attributes bit that Intel IA-64 processors use to allow programs to detect if they are running under IA-32 emulation. When a computer is powered on, the CPU starts in real mode and begins booting. The 64-bit operating system then checks and switches the CPU into Long mode and then starts new kernel-mode threads running 64-bit code.|$|R

25|$|In theory, real-mode {{applications}} {{could be}} directly executed in 16-bit <b>protected</b> <b>mode</b> if certain rules (newly proposed {{with the introduction}} of the 80286) were followed; however, as many DOS programs did not conform to those rules, <b>protected</b> <b>mode</b> was not widely used until the appearance of its successor, the 32-bit Intel 80386, which was designed to go back and forth between modes easily and to provide an emulation of real mode within <b>protected</b> <b>mode.</b> When Intel designed the 286, it was not designed to be able to multitask real-mode applications; real mode was intended to be a simple way for a bootstrap loader to prepare the system and then switch to protected mode; essentially, in <b>protected</b> <b>mode</b> the 80286 was designed to be a new processor with many similarities to its predecessors, while real mode on the 80286 was offered for smaller-scale systems that could benefit from a more advanced version of the 80186 CPU core, with advantages such as higher clock rates, faster instruction execution (measured in clock cycles), and unmultiplexed buses, but not the 24-bit (16 MB) memory space.|$|E

25|$|The <b>protected</b> <b>mode</b> of the 80286 was not {{utilized}} until {{many years}} after its release, {{in part because of}} the high cost of adding extended memory to a PC, but also because of the need for software to support the large user base of 8086 PCs. For example, in 1986 the only program that made use of it was VDISK, a RAM disk driver included with PC DOS 3.0 and 3.1. A DOS could utilize the additional RAM available in <b>protected</b> <b>mode</b> (extended memory) either via a BIOS call (INT 15h, AH=87h), as a RAM disk, or as emulation of expanded memory. The difficulty lay in the incompatibility of older real-mode DOS programs with <b>protected</b> <b>mode.</b> They simply could not natively run in this new mode without significant modification. In <b>protected</b> <b>mode,</b> memory management and interrupt handling were done differently than in real mode. In addition, DOS programs typically would directly access data and code segments that did not belong to them, as real mode allowed them to do without restriction; in contrast, the design intent of <b>protected</b> <b>mode</b> was to prevent programs from accessing any segments other than their own unless special access was explicitly allowed. While it was possible to set up a protected-mode environment that allowed all programs access to all segments (by putting all segment descriptors into the GDT and assigning them all the same privilege level), this undermined nearly all of the advantages of <b>protected</b> <b>mode</b> except the extended (24-bit) address space. The choice that OS developers faced was either to start from scratch and create an OS that would not run the vast majority of the old programs, or to come up with a version of DOS that was slow and ugly (i.e., ugly from an internal technical viewpoint) but would still run a majority of the old programs. <b>Protected</b> <b>mode</b> also did not provide a significant enough performance advantage over the 8086-compatible real mode to justify supporting its capabilities; actually, except for task switches when multitasking, it actually yielded only a performance disadvantage, by slowing down many instructions through a litany of added privilege checks. In <b>protected</b> <b>mode,</b> registers were still 16-bit, and the programmer was still forced to use a memory map composed of 64kB segments, just like in real mode.|$|E
25|$|Later, two new {{versions}} were released: Windows/286 2.1 and Windows/386 2.1. Like prior {{versions of}} Windows, Windows/286 2.1 used the real-mode memory model, but {{was the first}} version to support the High Memory Area. Windows/386 2.1 had a <b>protected</b> <b>mode</b> kernel with LIM-standard EMS emulation. All Windows and DOS-based applications {{at the time were}} real mode, running over the <b>protected</b> <b>mode</b> kernel by using the virtual 8086 mode, which was new with the 80386 processor.|$|E
25|$|Windows 3.0's user {{interface}} finally resembled a serious competitor to the {{user interface}} of the Macintosh computer. PCs had improved graphics by this time, due to VGA video cards, and the protected/enhanced mode allowed Windows applications to use more memory in a more painless manner than their DOS counterparts could. Windows 3.0 could run in real, standard, or 386 enhanced modes, and was compatible with any Intel processor from the 8086/8088 up to the 80286 and 80386. This was the first version to run Windows programs in <b>protected</b> <b>mode,</b> although the 386 enhanced mode kernel was an enhanced version of the <b>protected</b> <b>mode</b> kernel in Windows/386.|$|E

40|$|How do we uniquely {{identify}} a quantum phase, given its ground state wave-function? This {{is a key}} question for many body theory especially when we consider phases like topological insulators, that share the same symmetry but differ {{at the level of}} topology. The entanglement spectrum has been proposed as a ground state property that captures characteristic edge excitations. Here we study the entanglement spectrum for topological band insulators. We first show that insulators with topological surface states will necessarily also have <b>protected</b> <b>modes</b> in the entanglement spectrum. Surprisingly, however, the converse is not true. <b>Protected</b> entanglement <b>modes</b> can also appear for insulators without physical surface states, in which case they capture a more elusive property. This is illustrated by considering insulators with only inversion symmetry. Inversion is shown to act in an unusual way, as an antiunitary operator, on the entanglement spectrum, leading to this protection. The entanglement degeneracies indicate a variety of different phases in inversion symmetric insulators, and these phases are argued to be robust to the introduction of interactions.

25|$|When Windows 95 started up, MS-DOS loaded, {{processed}} CONFIG.SYS, launched COMMAND.COM, ran AUTOEXEC.BAT {{and finally}} ran WIN.COM.

40|$|A {{systematic}} approach for deriving tight-binding approximations in general longitudinally driven lattices is presented. As prototypes, honeycomb and staggered square lattices are considered. Time-reversal symmetry is broken by varying/rotating the waveguides, longitudinally, along {{the direction of}} propagation. Different sublattice rotation and structure are allowed. Linear Floquet bands are constructed for intricate sublattice rotation patterns such as counter rotation, phase offset rotation, as well as different lattice sizes and frequencies. An asymptotic analysis of the edge modes, valid in a rapid-spiraling regime, reveals linear and nonlinear envelopes which are governed by linear and nonlinear Schrodinger equations, respectively. Nonlinear states, referred to as topologically protected edge solitons are unidirectional edge modes. Direct numerical simulations for both the linear and nonlinear edge states agree with the asymptotic theory.

25|$|In January 1985, Digital Research previewed the Concurrent DOS 286 {{operating}} system developed {{in cooperation with}} Intel. The product would function strictly as an 80286 native-mode (i.e. protected-mode) {{operating system}}, allowing users {{to take full advantage}} of the <b>protected</b> <b>mode</b> to perform multi-user, multitasking operations while running 8086 emulation. This worked on the B-1 prototype step of the chip, but Digital Research discovered problems with the emulation on the production level C-1 step in May, which would not allow Concurrent DOS 286 to run 8086 software in <b>protected</b> <b>mode.</b> The release of Concurrent DOS 286 was delayed until Intel would develop a new version of the chip. In August, after extensive testing on E-1 step samples of the 80286, Digital Research acknowledged that Intel corrected all documented 286 errata, but said that there were still undocumented chip performance problems with the prerelease version of Concurrent DOS 286 running on the E-1 step. Intel said that the approach Digital Research wished to take in emulating 8086 software in <b>protected</b> <b>mode</b> differed from the original specifications. Nevertheless, in the E-2 step, they implemented minor changes in the microcode that would allow Digital Research to run emulation mode much faster. Named IBM 4680 OS, IBM originally chose DR Concurrent DOS 286 as the basis of their IBM 4680 computer for IBM Plant System products and point-of-sale terminals in 1986. Digital Research's FlexOS 286 version 1.0, a derivation of Concurrent DOS 286, was developed in 1986, introduced in January 1987, and later adopted by IBM for their IBM 4690 OS, but the same limitations affected it.|$|E
