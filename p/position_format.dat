As a side note: some demos exploited the sound generated by the head moving stepper motor to force the disk drive to play crude tunes ("Bicycle Built For Two" [...] was one) by varying the frequency of step requests sent to the motor.|$|R

40|$|Proper {{labeling}} {{can have}} {{an enormous impact on}} how a user interacts with a device by increasing intuitiveness, minimizing required training, and ensuring accurate performance. Properly designed labeling presents users with instructions, identifications, markings, symbols, colors, and commands that they already know or can easily intuit. Labeling of medical devices and associated accessories, shipping containers, and wrappings applies to labels, symbols, demarcation lines, shading, <b>positioning,</b> <b>formatting,</b> and markings related to the controls, displays, connectors, and other features of a medical device. Labeling should be the absolute last resort for protecting users from potential risks. General Considerations All equipment elements that are not intuitively obvious, that have some usable functions, or that require identification for other reasons should be labeled or marked. Markings should be positioned so that they are clearly associated with the correct equipment feature and not obscured by hand positions or equipment components. Appropriate markings can enhance the identification of both individual elements and their functional relationships. Labels should be visible at typical viewing distances and angles. General Considerations Labels should be resistant to wear and tear. Ambiguous symbols, codes, or terminology should be avoided. Designing for legibility requires careful analysis of ambient illumination in typical use environments. Consistency of placement, terminology, and coding is critical. All markings should be tested with typical users. Users can be clinicians, caregivers, patients, or maintenance personnel and can vary by age, disability, and other characteristics...|$|R

Theoretical performance results are presented, and the relation between this type of decoding and "tree searching" is developed...|$|R
