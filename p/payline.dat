50|$|Each {{machine has}} a table that lists {{the number of}} credits the player will receive if the symbols listed on the pay table line up on the <b>payline</b> of the machine. The pay table details where the symbols must be for the bettor to be paid. In general, the symbols must be {{centered}} directly under the <b>payline</b> on the machine. Video slot machines generally will only display the <b>payline</b> for lines that are winners.|$|E

50|$|Some {{machines}} offer {{symbols that}} are 'wild' and will pay {{if they are}} visible in any position, {{even if they are}} not on the <b>payline.</b> These wild symbols may also count for any other symbol on the pay table.|$|E
50|$|The Ghostbusters {{slot machine}} {{was one of}} the most {{anticipated}} games released by International Game Technology in 2012. It is popular in the casinos of Las Vegas and there is also an online version of the game. It features 5 reels and 30 <b>paylines</b> with 3 interactive bonus rounds that can be unlocked.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of its release, the game {{distinguished}} itself among other slot games with its avalanche feature. While other games had spinning reels, the symbols in Gonzo's Quest fall into the reels. When a winning line is formed, its symbols explode and are replaced by new ones in another avalanche, which means there can be several payouts in a single spin. There are 20 different <b>paylines.</b> The Free Fall feature awards bonus rounds when three or more bonus icons appear. Five such icons result in the top payout.|$|R
40|$|The time-honored {{mechanism}} of allocating funds based on ranking of proposals by scientific peer review {{is no longer}} effective, because review panels cannot accurately stratify proposals to identify the most meritorious ones. Bias has {{a major influence on}} funding decisions, and the impact of reviewer bias is magnified by low funding <b>paylines.</b> Despite {{more than a decade of}} funding crisis, there has been no fundamental reform in the mechanism for funding research. This essay explores the idea of awarding research funds on the basis of a modified lottery in which peer review is used to identify the most meritorious proposals, from which funded applications are selected by lottery. We suggest that a modified lottery for research fund allocation would have many advantages over the current system, including reducing bias and improving grantee diversity with regard to seniority, race, and gender...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Payline</b> is a {{line that}} crosses through one symbol on each reel, along which a winning {{combination}} is evaluated. Classic spinning reel machines usually have up to nine paylines, while video slot machines may {{have as many as}} one hundred. Paylines could be of various shapes (horizontal, vertical, oblique, triangular, zigzag, etc.) ...|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s, however, {{slot machine}} {{manufacturers}} incorporated electronics into their products and programmed them to weight particular symbols. Thus {{the odds of}} losing symbols appearing on the <b>payline</b> became disproportionate to their actual frequency on the physical reel. A symbol would only appear once on the reel displayed to the player, but could, in fact, occupy several stops on the multiple reel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Payline</b> {{is a line}} (straight or zig-zagged) {{that crosses}} one symbol on each reel of slot machine or the {{combination}} of symbols on the slot machine reels the player is paid out for if {{he has made a}} bet on that combination. To be winning any combination on the reels must have at least two identical symbols in a row, and the first one must occur on the first reel unless otherwise stated. In other case, the combination doesn't pay out.|$|E
40|$|The National Institutes of Health {{and many}} of our {{biomedical}} institutions face significant budgetary challenges {{that are likely to}} persist for the foreseeable future. The <b>paylines</b> for Research Project Grant (RO 1) applications to the NIH will be near or below the tenth percentile, and many investigators are growing increasingly concerned about maintaining their research programs. One of the most concerning potential results of limited grant dollars is the natural tendency for researchers to propose conservative projects that are more likely to succeed, to do well in peer review, and to be funded, but that may not dramatically advance the field, and a concurrent tendency among study sections to reward proposals that are seen as safe, if uninspiring. Established and well-respected investigators may be (perhaps appropriately) given {{the benefit of the doubt}} when compared with less-established colleagues and may therefore command a growing percentage of the total available grant dollars, while simultaneously avoiding bold and potentially groundbreaking approaches. At the same time, fewer dollars are available for new investigators with unproven track records and for the expansion of newly successful programs...|$|R
40|$|In prior columns, I have {{discussed}} the centrality of psychological science as a hub discipline, the rise in collaborative and interdisciplinary science, and the important role psychological scientists have to play in these developments. Large scale science is expensive, however, and these encouraging developments are being constrained by the stagnation in the growth in federal funding for psychological science. For instance, according to statistics provided by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the total research budget (excluding development and R&D facilities) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has hovered around $ 27 billion in recent years. 1 The stagnation of the budget at the NIH, coupled with dramatic increases {{in the number of}} grant applications and the mean budget size of the applications submitted to the NIH, has led to a lowering of <b>paylines</b> and, in some cases, a rethinking of institute funding priorities (see Loscalzo, 2006). As a result of these developments, I asked several institute directors at NIH to share with us their goals for their institute and the role they see for psychological scientists. I am pleased to feature here my interview with Richard J. Hodes, director of the National Institut...|$|R
5000|$|It {{begins with}} Perry holding hands with her love {{interest}} played by Joel David Moore. They {{are in a}} laundromat, {{standing in front of}} a slot machine.

5000|$|The $60 {{million a}} year in public money that is being spent - I would say, wasted - on the PSI is enough to fund {{approximately}} 100-200 individual investigator-initiated research grants. These hypothesis-driven proposals are the lifeblood of the scientific enterprise, and as I have discussed recently in other columns, they are being sucked dry by, among other things, an increasing trend to fund large initiatives at their expense. That $60 {{million a year}} would raise the <b>payline</b> at a typical NIH institute by about 6 percentile points, enough to make a huge difference to peer review and to the continuance of a lot of important science.

50|$|Multi-line slot {{machines}} {{have become more}} popular since the 1990s. These machines {{have more than one}} <b>payline,</b> meaning that visible symbols that are not aligned on the main horizontal may be considered for winning combinations. Reel {{slot machines}} commonly have three or five paylines, while video slot machines may have 9, 15, 25, or as many as 243 different paylines. Most video slot machines have a themed game, some of which feature graphics and music based on popular entertainers, motion pictures or TV programs (The Addams Family, I Dream of Jeannie, Happy Days, etc.) with a bonus round. Most accept variable numbers of credits to play, with 1 to 15 credits per line being typical. The higher the amount bet, the higher the payout will be if the player wins.|$|E
50|$|On multiway games, players {{play the}} entire {{position}} of each reel instead of fixed lines or patterns. For instance, {{if a player}} plays 1 reel on a 243 way game, they receive three symbols in the first reel which pay anywhere in the three positions, while all other reels pay in the centre only, with unused areas darkened. On {{the other end of}} the scale, if the player plays 5 reels, symbols can appear anywhere in the window and will pay as long as there is one in each reel. Most games however still require the symbols appearing left to right, sometimes this even includes scatters. Scatter symbols still pay the same as per conventional games, multiplying their pay amount by the total bet and the amount of ways/reels played. Other multiway games give you even more ways by using a 4x5 or 5x5 pattern, where there are up to 5 symbols in each reel, allowing for up to 1,024 and 3,125 ways to win respectively. Aristocrat calls these games Xtra Reel Power and Super Reel Power respectively. These games typically cost more than their 243 way Reel Power counterparts. Recently, IGT has also started to manufacture multiway games. Gaming machine manufacturer Konami Australia also made an alternative way of gaming by using patterns, where symbols pay adjacent to one another. Most of these games have a hexagonal reel formation, and much like multiway games, any patterns not played are darkened out of use. On both systems, scatter symbols still pay in the darkened areas just like standard machines where scatters don't have to appear on a <b>payline.</b>|$|E
40|$|Near-misses occur {{across many}} forms of {{gambling}} and are rated as unpleasant while simultaneously increasing the motivation to continue playing. On slot machines, the icon position relative to the <b>payline</b> moderates the effects of near-misses, with near-misses before the <b>payline</b> increasing motivation, and near-misses after the <b>payline</b> being rated as aversive. Near-misses are also known to increase physiological arousal compared to full-misses, but physiological measures to date {{have not been able}} to dissociate positive and negative emotional responses. The present study measured facial electromyography at the corrugator (brow) and zygomaticus (cheek) sites, as well as electrodermal activity (EDA), following gambling outcomes on a two-reel slot machine simulation in 77 novice gamblers. Behavioral data was collected using trial-by-trial ratings of motivation and valence. Wins were rated as more pleasant and increased motivation to continue playing, compared to non-win outcomes. Wins were also accompanied by increased EDA and zygomaticus activity. Near-misses after the <b>payline</b> were rated as more aversive than other non-wins, and this was accompanied by increased EDA and zygomaticus activity. Near-misses before the <b>payline</b> increased motivation to continue playing, and were accompanied by increased EDA. Thus, both subjective and physiological responses to near-misses differ for events falling either side of the <b>payline.</b> The ‘near-miss effect’ is not a unitary phenomenon. Facial EMG has differential sensitivity to positive and negative valence and may be a useful measure for future studies of gambling behavior...|$|E
40|$|Individually, both {{near-misses}} {{and losses}} disguised as wins (LDWs) {{have been seen}} to exert pro-motivational effects on gambling. However, {{it is not clear}} whether both structural characteristics are effective within the same game. Participants (n = 40) played a slot machine simulation. The simulation delivered near-misses, wins and ‘full-misses’. Half the participants also received LDWs that occurred independently of the outcomes on the <b>payline.</b> Valence and motivation ratings were collected after each round. Results showed that the LDW group reported increased valence ratings compared to the no-LDW group. Within the LDW group, trials with LDWs also resulted in increased enjoyment compared to trials without LDWs. We distinguished near-misses falling either side of the <b>payline.</b> Near-misses before the <b>payline</b> (NMB) were rated as more motivational than near-misses after the <b>payline</b> (NMA), whereas NMAs were rated as more aversive than NMBs. These differences between the two near-miss types were exacerbated by LDWs. Results demonstrate LDWs increase the trial-by-trial enjoyment of non-win outcomes. The motivational and hedonic effects of near-misses differed for events either side of the <b>payline,</b> and these differences were exaggerated by the presence of LDWs. Thus, near-misses can retain their effectiveness in complex forms of gambling that also deliver LDWs...|$|E
40|$|Gambling {{behavior}} generates sizeable {{expenditures in}} virtually {{every country in the}} world. In some cases it is closely regulated and even operated by governments, and in virtually all countries legal gambling generates massive tax revenues. The vast bulk of the games that generate these expenditures and revenues have a known, negative expected value. We consider the welfare evaluation of gambling behavior in such games, as welfare is defined by economists, and contrast that welfare evaluation with conventional survey measures of “problem” gambling behavior. We demonstrate our methodology using controlled laboratory and field experiments with video slot gambling behavior. Experimental treatments include the use of single <b>payline</b> or multiple <b>payline</b> machines, the use of abstract tokens or actual currency, stake size, and the display of “near miss” information. Complementary experiments measure risk preferences and subjective beliefs about video slot outcomes. The lab experiments also collect responses to popular survey measures of gambling prevalence. The field experiments go further, and sample from respondents characterized as “problem gamblers” in those surveys, as well as control subjects with “no detectable risk. ” This sample design also allows an evaluation of the predictive validity of those survey measures for actual gambling choices over real money...|$|E
40|$|I {{am writing}} {{regarding}} {{the role of}} the NIH in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). Given the short period of time the NIH has been allowed to disperse its funds, it seems that extending the duration of grants that are nearing completion or raising the <b>payline</b> of currently funded grants are two of the most straightforward options. Along these lines, allocating a subset of this money to extend the funding of NIH F 32 grants by 12 months for postdoctoral scholars nearing the end of their fellowship would both serve the NIH commitment to fostering young scientists and meet the goals of the ARRA to infuse money into the economy...|$|E
40|$|The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) {{looks to}} peer review to guide its funding {{decisions}} for investigator-initiated R 01 grants, {{which make up}} the larg-est single component of our extramural portfolio. 1 For the most part, successful applications are those that fall below a percentile ranking value of peer review priority scores; the cut-off percentile ranking value, or <b>payline,</b> is determined by budgetary considerations. Despite longstanding tradition and affirmations, many question the ability of peer review, as it is currently practiced, to identify those research proposals {{most likely to have}} high impact, and whether it has impact on sci-entific thought, clinical practice, or public policy. 2 – 5 Although previous reports have questioned the internal consistency and validity of peer review, 5 there is little data regarding the as-sociation, if any, with postaward scientific achievement. 4 We, therefore, conducted an observational analysis of percentile rankings and bibliometric outcomes for a contemporary set of NHLBI-funded cardiovascular R 01 grants...|$|E
