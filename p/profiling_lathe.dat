40|$|Key words: {{profiling}} lathe; profiling measurement; digital capture; contour segmentation; path optimization Abstract. Aimed at {{the goal}} of digital capture function for CNC <b>profiling</b> <b>lathe,</b> it has conducted researches on the key technologies of CNC system development, including automatic profiling measurement, profiling data collection methods and G-code program automatically generation. Before process, use an on-off-type laser sensor along the planned path close to the sample workpiece point by point to get series of coordinate points of the contour through the CNC system position latch function and the switch of senor’s state; through subsequent processing methods: contour segmentation, curve filtering, etc. And generate the G-code program for process. Practice shows that this special CNC system for <b>profiling</b> <b>lathe,</b> not only integrates automatic profiling data acquisition, automatic generation of process G code program, and has the characteristics of simple structure, easy operation and high efficiency...|$|E
25|$|A lathe is an {{adjustable}} horizontal metal rail and a tool rest, between {{the material and}} the operator which accommodates the positioning of shaping tools. With wood, it is common practice to press and slide sandpaper against the still-spinning object after shaping it to smooth the surface. As {{the first of its}} kind, Thomas Blanchard of Middlebury, Connecticut, invented the <b>profile</b> <b>lathe</b> in 1818, intended for the mass duplication of woodworking.|$|R

This {{was in part}} because of innovative product development at the Halifax site which ultimately produced the CR P5 and P6 profiling lathes: the conclusion of this development is described by Jeremy as being a range of [...] "fully automatic, multi-tool and <b>profiling</b> <b>lathes.</b> A lathe with an automatic feed and delivery heralded an automatic machine tool production line." [...] The expansion of the motor vehicle industry once again was a significant factor, driving demand for machine tools much as the bicycling boom of the 1890s had done. In 1957 the Scotswood operation moved across the River Tyne to Blaydon, where a factory was built especially for the manufacturing purpose intended. Among other products from that site was the Vertimax lathe, which used a vertical spindle and was of interest to motor vehicle manufacturers. This particular design originated from James Anderson, a garage owner in Glasgow, during the war and whose business was brought into the Churchill group of companies. Churchill Gear Machines Ltd was part of the group, having been established in Blaydon since 1956: the cause of its origin and the nature of its products is uncertain.|$|R
