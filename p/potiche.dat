60|$|It was a disagreeable impression. But I {{reflected}} that probably the censorship of plays was an inactive monstrosity; {{not exactly a}} survival, since it seemed obviously at variance with {{the genius of the}} people, but an heirloom of past ages, a bizarre and imported curiosity preserved because of that weakness one has for one's old possessions apart from any intrinsic value; one more object of exotic virtu, an Oriental <b>potiche,</b> a magot chinois conceived by a childish and extravagant imagination, but allowed to stand in stolid impotence in the twilight of the upper shelf.|$|E
60|$|For I {{have lived}} long enough to learn that the monstrous and outlandish figure, the magot chinois whom I {{believed}} to be but a memorial of our forefathers' mental aberration, that grotesque <b>potiche,</b> works! The absurd and hollow creature of clay seems to be alive with a sort of (surely) unconscious life worthy of its traditions. It heaves its stomach, it rolls its eyes, it brandishes a monstrous arm: and with the censorship, like a Bravo of old Venice with a more carnal weapon, stabs its victim from behind in the twilight of its upper shelf. Less picturesque than the Venetian in cloak and mask, less estimable, too, in this, that the assassin plied his moral trade at his own risk deriving no countenance from the powers of the Republic, it stands more malevolent, inasmuch that the Bravo striking in the dusk killed but the body, whereas the grotesque thing nodding its mandarin head may in its absurd unconsciousness strike down at any time the spirit of an honest, of an artistic, perhaps of a sublime creation.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Potiche</b> is a 2010 French-Belgian comedy film {{directed}} by François Ozon, {{based on the}} play {{of the same name}} by Pierre Barillet and Jean-Pierre Grédy. It stars Catherine Deneuve, Gérard Depardieu, Fabrice Luchini, Karin Viard, Judith Godrèche and Jérémie Renier. Set in 1977, the film {{tells the story of a}} submissive wife who gets to run her husband's umbrella factory, after the employees rebel against their tyrannical manager. In French, a [...] "potiche" [...] is a decorative vase, but by extension means [...] "window dressing" [...] or, roughly, [...] "trophy wife". The film competed at the 67th Venice International Film Festival and received two Magritte Award nominations, winning Best Supporting Actor for Jérémie Renier.|$|E

50|$|François Ozon saw {{the play}} <b>Potiche</b> by Pierre Barillet and Jean-Pierre Grédy {{about ten years}} before he made the film. According to Ozon, {{the genesis of the}} film version was, partly, that he had been {{approached}} by the producers Éric and Nicolas Altmayer and asked to make a biographical film about Nicolas Sarkozy, and, partly, his experiences from the 2007 presidential campaign, where he followed the Socialist Party's candidate Ségolène Royal. While writing the screenplay, Ozon regularly met with Barillet, who gladly approved the tweaks made in order to enhance the story's relevance for contemporary society. The 1970s setting was, however, retained; this was both because the distance allowed the director to make a more humorous film, and because France was more politically divided in the 1970s, which made the class relations more remarkable. The political career of Suzanne was entirely Ozon's own addition to the story, which in its original incarnation ended when Robert returns to the factory.|$|E
