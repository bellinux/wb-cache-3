Its Institute for Conservation Research (formerly the Center for Reproduction of Endangered Species) raises California condors, giant pandas, tigers, black rhinos, polar bears, orangutans, peninsular pronghorn, desert tortoises, African penguins, mountain yellow-legged frogs, Pacific <b>pocket</b> <b>mice,</b> Francois' langurs, giraffes, quino checkerspot butterflies, Hawaiian crows, light-footed clapper rails, Gray's monitors, tree lobsters, clouded leopards, Galapagos tortoises, Tahiti lorikeets, lion-tailed macaques, mhorr gazelles, gorillas, Przewalski's horses, koalas, burrowing owls, elephants, Tasmanian devils, okapi, southwestern pond turtle, and 145 other endangered species. As a result, they have reintroduced more than 30 endangered species back into the wild, and have conserved habitat at 50 field sites. They also have over 200 conservation scientists working in 35 countries around the world. It employs numerous professional geneticists, cytologists, and veterinarians and maintains a cryopreservation facility for rare sperm and eggs called the frozen zoo.|$|E

40|$|The Great Basin <b>pocket</b> <b>mouse</b> (Perognathus parvus) is an {{inhabitant}} of arid {{regions that}} can obtain all its water needs from food sources (mainly seeds) instead of from drinking water. I tested {{the hypothesis that}} the Great Basin <b>pocket</b> <b>mouse</b> prefers seeds with higher water content. I compared preferences of a captive <b>pocket</b> <b>mouse</b> for different seed types with varying water content as well as dried seeds versus pre-moistened seeds. Six different dried seed types were tested in two groups of similar sized seeds: Millet, Milo, Flax (Group 1, small seeds); and Sunflower, Wheat, and Cracked Corn (Group 2, large seeds). Each group was offered to the <b>pocket</b> <b>mouse</b> twice a day for two weeks. Among the smaller dry seeds, the <b>pocket</b> <b>mouse</b> preferred millet over milo, and did not select any flaxseed. Among the larger seeds, the <b>pocket</b> <b>mouse</b> preferred wheat, which was the seed type with the highest water content. In a second experiment, a control (dry) seed mixture (equal parts of all six seed types) and an experimentally moistened group (same seed mixture) were offered to the <b>pocket</b> <b>mouse.</b> The <b>pocket</b> <b>mouse</b> preferred dried seeds over pre-moistened seeds.

5000|$|Like other heteromyids, the Perognathus longimembris pacificus (Pacific <b>pocket</b> <b>mouse)</b> is {{generally}} asocial and solitary. Other than during reproduction, {{they do not}} engage in direct social interactions often. There is relatively little information on the breeding biology of the Pacific <b>pocket</b> <b>mouse.</b> The Pacific <b>pocket</b> <b>mouse</b> does not reproduce offspring in large quantities or at a high speed. Most females typically produce one litter per year, sizing from about two to eight pups; occasionally, females may produce two litters in one year. [...] Generally, the breeding season for the Pacific <b>pocket</b> <b>mouse</b> is the months April through July, peaking in the spring. But, the breeding season can vary due to a few factors. The temperature, amount of food available, and the quantity of plant growth around the Pacific <b>pocket</b> <b>mouse’s</b> habitat can all affect its breeding season. In years with lower than average rainfall, reproduction may not take place. The gestation period for the Pacific <b>pocket</b> <b>mouse</b> lasts for twenty-two to twenty-three days.
