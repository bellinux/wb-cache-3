As the scientific body of exercise physiology has some overlap with athletics and sports training, the organization advocates for the unique contributions of exercise <b>physiologists</b> and attempts to enhance their public sector job opportunities.|$|R

His nephews include Richard Keynes (1919–2010), a <b>physiologist,</b> and Quentin Keynes (1921–2003), an adventurer and bibliophile.

His father, John Neville Keynes, was an {{economist}} and a lecturer in moral sciences at the University of Cambridge and his mother Florence Ada Keynes a local social reformer. Keynes was the first born, and was followed by two more children – Margaret Neville Keynes in 1885 and Geoffrey Keynes in 1887.

5|$|Although {{designed}} as a liberal arts-oriented university, UCSC quickly acquired a graduate-level natural science research component with the appointment of plant <b>physiologist</b> Kenneth V. Thimann as the first provost of Crown College. Thimann developed UCSC's early Division of Natural Sciences and recruited other well-known science faculty and graduate students to the fledgling campus. Immediately upon its founding, UCSC was also granted administrative responsibility for the Lick Observatory, which established the campus as a major center for astronomy research. Founding members of the Social Science and Humanities faculty created the unique History of Consciousness graduate program in UCSC's first year of operation.|$|E

5|$|The Swedish Academy {{chose the}} poet Sully Prudhomme {{for the first}} Nobel Prize in Literature. A group {{including}} 42 Swedish writers, artists, and literary critics protested against this decision, having expected Leo Tolstoy to be awarded. Some, including Burton Feldman, have criticised this prize because they consider Prudhomme a mediocre poet. Feldman's explanation {{is that most of}} the Academy members preferred Victorian literature and thus selected a Victorian poet. The first Physiology or Medicine Prize went to the German <b>physiologist</b> and microbiologist Emil von Behring. During the 1890s, von Behring developed an antitoxin to treat diphtheria, which until then was causing thousands of deaths each year.|$|E
5|$|The {{riddle of}} water and {{nutrient}} transport through the plant remained. <b>Physiologist</b> Von Mohl explored solute transport and the theory of water uptake by the roots using the concepts of cohesion, transpirational pull, capillarity and root pressure. German dominance {{in the field of}} physiology was underlined by the publication of the definitive textbook on plant physiology synthesising the work of this period, Sach's e of 1882. There were, however, some advances elsewhere such as the early exploration of geotropism (the effect of gravity on growth) by Englishman Thomas Knight, and the discovery and naming of osmosis by Frenchman Henri Dutrochet (1776–1847).|$|E

40|$|Accredited Exercise <b>Physiologists</b> are allied health {{professionals}} {{trained in the}} delivery of exercise and lifestyle interventions for people with chronic illness including mental illness. This study aimed to investigate how Accredited Exercise <b>Physiologists</b> engage in the treatment of people with a mental illness. Accredited Exercise <b>Physiologists</b> were invited to complete an online survey via communication from Exercise and Sports Science Australia. Sixty-one Accredited Exercise <b>Physiologists</b> completed the online survey. The majority of AEPs agree that exercise is valuable in the treatment of people with a mental illness. General Practitioners are the most common referral source. Exercise <b>Physiologists</b> believe more people with a mental illness should be referred for services, however more than half agree that people with a mental illness are likely to be less adherent to an exercise intervention compared to people without a mental illness. More than half of respondents report no formal training in training in the prescription of exercise for people with a mental illness however 89 % believe additional professional development would be beneficial. Given the support for the efficacy of exercise in the treatment of people with mental illness, this group of {{health professionals}} appears to be an underutilised resource...|$|R

5|$|In 1939, with Babcock's support, Stebbins {{was made}} a full {{professor}} in the Department of Genetics at UC Berkeley, after the Department of Botany failed to promote him. Stebbins was required to teach a course on evolution, and during his preparation he became excited by contemporary research combining genetics and evolution. He became associated with a group known as the Bay Area Biosystematists, which included botanist Jens Clausen, taxonomist David D. Keck, <b>physiologist</b> William Hiesey and the evolutionary geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky. During this time he also became friends with the botanist Herbert Baker. With the encouragement of this group of scientists, Stebbins directed his research towards evolution. He became involved with the Society for the Study of Evolution in 1946, {{and was one of}} the few botanists involved with the new organization.|$|E
5|$|Stokvis {{was born}} to Rachel Wittering and Joseph Barend Stokvis, Jr., a Jewish {{physician}} and obstetrician in Amsterdam. He studied medicine in Amsterdam and at the University of Utrecht under Franciscus Donders and Jacobus Schroeder van der Kolk, obtaining a doctorate on a dissertation on hepatic glucose production in diabetes in 1856. His thesis appeared shortly {{after the publication of}} related work by the French <b>physiologist</b> Claude Bernard. Stokvis may also have been influenced by the chemist Gerardus Mulder in Amsterdam. Subsequently, he travelled to Paris and Vienna (and possibly Prague), before establishing himself in medical practice in Amsterdam. He continued his medical research under the physiologists Adriaan Heynsius, Wilhelm Kühne and Thomas Place. In 1867, the Brussels Academy awarded a gold medal to Stokvis for an essay on the development of albuminuria, a kidney disorder in which the protein albumin can be detected in the urine.|$|E

40|$|Clinical <b>physiologists</b> in Sweden are {{physicians}} (the majority with a PhD degree) with thorough {{training in}} system physiology and pathophysiology. They investigate {{patients in a}} functional approach and are engaged in basic and applied physiology teaching and research. In 1954, clinical physiology was founded as an independent academic and clinical discipline by the Swedish government to ensure "contact between routine clinical work and the scientific progression. " Up until 2008, clinical physiology was an independent clinical discipline but was then made a subdiscipline to radiology, a fundamentally different discipline. Individuals wishing to become clinical <b>physiologists</b> are required to be trained and certified as European radiologists, after which training and certification as clinical <b>physiologists</b> may be pursued. This means that radiologists without training in clinical physiology have become gatekeepers for future clinical <b>physiologists.</b> Unfortunately, this development takes place {{at a time when}} research and education in preclinical integrative physiology have diminished in favor of other organizational levels, such as cellular and molecular biology. The responsibilities for education and research in integrative human physiology have therefore mainly been transferred to clinical <b>physiologists.</b> Clinical physiology has been a successful independent clinical discipline in Sweden for the past 55 years and could {{serve as a model for}} other countries. Unless clinical <b>physiologists</b> regain control over their own discipline, systems physiology as a knowledge base and resource for patient care, education, and research will be severely impaired...|$|R
