5|$|As head of state, Hitler became supreme {{commander}} of the armed forces. The traditional loyalty oath of servicemen was altered to affirm loyalty to Hitler personally, by name, {{rather than to the}} office of supreme commander or the state.

5|$|I've had to {{deal with}} some hard truths... People don't like to hear we've got only 18 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electorate.</b> They pretend it's not {{important}} that our following among blacks, and young people, and urban communities is not what it should be... But I feel it's of the greatest importance that if there's to be a Republican Party, we look these facts in the face.|$|E
5|$|Abraham Lincoln's {{constitutional}} election {{reflected the}} nation’s sectional divide, though 82 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electorate</b> had split among the Unionists, Lincoln, Stephen A. Douglas and John Bell. Even before Lincoln’s inauguration, the Deep South states that had cast Electoral College votes for John C. Breckinridge resolved {{to secede from}} the United States and form the Confederate States of America. The Virginia Assembly called a special convention {{for the sole purpose}} of considering secession from the United States. Virginia was deeply divided, returning a convention of delegates amounting to about one-third for secession and two thirds Unionist. But the Unionists would prove to be further divided between those who would be labelled Conditional Unionists who would favor Virginia in the Union only if Lincoln made no move at “coercion”, and those who would later be called Unconditional Unionists who would be unwavering in their loyalty to the constitutional government of the United States.|$|E

40|$|No {{other group}} is as {{disengaged}} from elections as youth. Voter turnout in the United States trails {{that of other}} industrialized societies, and is particularly anemic among youth between <b>the</b> ages <b>of</b> 18 and 24. <b>The</b> under-representation <b>of</b> youth voters has been observed ever since eighteen year olds were enfranchised in 1972 (for evidence, see Levine and Lopez, 2002; Bennett, 1997).

50|$|In February 2013, California had 18,055,783 {{registered}} voters, comprising about 47% of {{its total}} population of 38.43 million. Of those registered voters, 7,932,373 (43.9 percent) were registered Democrats, and 5,225,675 (28.9 percent) were Republicans.

25|$|The general {{election}} {{was held on}} November 7. This election had the lowest voter turnout for a presidential election since 1948, with only 55 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electorate</b> voting.

25|$|Things {{changed in}} early 2007, with new National leader John Key {{improving}} on Brash's preferred Prime Minister rating by ten points, and overtaking Clark as preferred Prime Minister in May; {{at the same}} time National jumped out to a sizeable lead over Labour ranging from between eight and eighteen points, spending most of 2007 and 2008 with support from around fifty <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electorate.</b> Labour's popularity slumped, hitting its lowest point in the winter of 2008, before beginning a slow climb into the high thirties in August and September.|$|E
25|$|Representation of the People Act 1918 – the {{consequences}} of World War I persuaded the government to expand the right to vote, {{not only for the}} many men who fought in the war who were disenfranchised, but also for the women who worked in factories, agriculture and elsewhere as part of the war effort, often substituting for enlisted men and including dangerous work such as in munitions factories. All men aged 21 and over were given the right to vote. Property restrictions for voting were lifted for men. Votes were given to 40% of women, with property restrictions and limited to those over 30 years old. This increased the electorate from 7.7 million to 21.4 million with women making up 8.5 million of the electorate. Seven <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electorate</b> had more than one vote. The first election with this system was the 1918 general election.|$|E

In May 2004, Gallup reported that 89 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Republican <b>electorate</b> approved <b>of</b> Bush.

25|$|The {{referendum}} {{would go}} ahead, {{but since the}} impeachment vote failed, <b>the</b> Congress <b>of</b> People's Deputies sought to set new terms for a popular referendum. <b>The</b> legislature's version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> referendum asked whether citizens had confidence in Yeltsin, approved of his reforms, and supported early presidential and legislative elections. The parliament voted {{that in order to}} win, the president would need to obtain 50 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole <b>electorate,</b> rather than 50 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> those actually voting, to avoid an early presidential election.|$|R
500|$|On 2 August 1934, President von Hindenburg died. The {{previous}} day, {{the cabinet}} had enacted the [...] "Law Concerning the Highest State Office of the Reich", which stated that upon Hindenburg's death {{the office of}} president would be abolished and its powers merged {{with those of the}} chancellor. Hitler thus became head of state as well as head of government and he was formally named as Führer und Reichskanzler (leader and chancellor). Germany was now a totalitarian state with Hitler at its head. As head of state, Hitler became Supreme Commander of the armed forces. The new law altered the traditional loyalty oath of servicemen so that they affirmed loyalty to Hitler personally rather than the office of supreme commander or the state. On 19 August, the merger of the presidency with the chancellorship was approved by 90 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electorate</b> in a plebiscite.|$|E
