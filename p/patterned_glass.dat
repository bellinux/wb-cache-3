25|$|The {{passenger}} berths {{were arranged}} around two large central saloons—a dining saloon and a grand saloon—into which they opened. Each saloon was illuminated by several large-diameter ventilated columns of <b>patterned</b> <b>glass</b> which stretched {{from the floor}} to a skylight in the spar deck above, while stained glass windows in the stern provided additional light. The saloons were richly carpeted, furnished with variegated Italian marble tables and superior quality furniture, and finished in a combination of woods, including rose, satin and olive. Mirrors around the walls enhanced the effect of spaciousness. A ladies' drawing-room was also provided.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} Roman glass follows Hellenistic {{traditions and}} uses strongly coloured and ‘mosaic’ <b>patterned</b> <b>glass.</b> During the late Republican period new highly coloured striped wares with {{a fusion of}} dozens of monochrome and lace-work strips were introduced. During this period {{there is some evidence}} that styles of glass varied geographically, with the translucent coloured fine wares of the early 1st century notably ‘western’ in origin, whilst the later colourless fine wares are more ‘international’. These objects also represent the first with a distinctly Roman style unrelated to the Hellenistic casting traditions on which they are based, and are characterised by novel rich colours. ‘Emerald’ green, dark or cobalt blue, a deep blue-green and Persian or ‘peacock’ blue are most commonly associated with this period, and other colours are very rare. Of these, Emerald green and peacock blue were new colours introduced by the Romano-Italian industry and almost exclusively associated with the production of fine wares.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn the {{mammalian}} brain, {{form and}} motion are processed through two distinct pathways at {{early stages of}} visual processing. However, recent evidence suggests that these two pathways may interact. Here we used dynamic <b>Glass</b> <b>patterns,</b> which have been previously shown to create the perception of coherent motion in humans, despite containing no motion coherence. <b>Glass</b> <b>patterns</b> are static stimuli that consist of randomly positioned dot pairs that are integrated spatially to create the perception of a global form, whereas dynamic <b>Glass</b> <b>patterns</b> consist of several independently generated static <b>Glass</b> <b>patterns</b> presented sequentially. In the current study, we measured the detection threshold of five types of dynamic <b>Glass</b> <b>patterns</b> and compared the rank order of the detection thresholds with those found for static <b>Glass</b> <b>patterns</b> and real motion patterns (using random dot stimuli). With both the static <b>Glass</b> <b>patterns</b> and dynamic <b>Glass</b> <b>patterns,</b> detection thresholds were lowest for concentric and radial patterns and highest for horizontal patterns. We also found that vertical patterns were better detected than horizontal patterns, consistent with prior evidence of a “horizontal effect” {{in the perception of}} natural scene images. With real motion, detection thresholds were equivalent across all patterns, with the exception of higher thresholds for spiral patterns. Our results suggest that dynamic <b>Glass</b> <b>patterns</b> are processed primarily as form prior to input into the motion system...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} {{adaptation}} to radial and rotational polar optic flow on {{the classification of}} noisy test patterns are shown to be {{very similar to the}} effects of adaptation to polar <b>Glass</b> <b>patterns</b> on the classification of noisy <b>Glass</b> <b>patterns</b> (Clifford, C. W. G. & Weston, E. (2005). Aftereffect of adaptation to <b>Glass</b> <b>patterns.</b> Vision Research, 45 1355 – 1363.). In both cases there is a large shift in the signal strength at which test patterns are classified as radial or rotational with equal probability. Two asymmetries were discovered: (1) adaptation to optic flow alters the classification of <b>Glass</b> <b>patterns,</b> but the reverse is not true; and (2) adaptation to <b>Glass</b> <b>patterns</b> decreases detectability of patterns of the same type, but adaptation to optic flow has little effect on the detectability of patterns of any type. We conclude that the mechanisms that detect radial and rotational <b>Glass</b> <b>patterns</b> are independent and independently adaptable, but that the mechanisms that detect the path of optic flow, when directional effects are cancelled out, are linked in an opponent, push–pull fashion...|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} maskless photolithography using a patterned light generator for creating 2 -D and 3 -D patterns on objects using etching and deposition techniques. In an embodiment, the patterned light generator uses a micromirror array to direct pattern {{light on a}} target object. In an alternate embodiment, the patterned light generator uses a plasma display device to generate and direct patterned light onto a target object. Specifically, the invention provides a maskless photolithography system and method for photo stimulated etching of objects in a liquid solution, <b>patterning</b> <b>glass,</b> and photoselective metal deposition. For photo stimulated etching of objects in a liquid solution, the invention provides a system and method for immersing a substrate in an etchant solution, exposing the immersed substrate to patterned light, and etching the substrate according to the pattern of incident light. For <b>patterning</b> photoreactive <b>glass,</b> the invention provides a system and method for exposing photosensitive or photochromic glass, and washing the target glass with rinse and acid etchant solutions. For photoselective metal deposition, the invention provides a system and method for coating and rinsing a substrate prior to exposure exposing the substrate to a patterned light generator to activate areas corresponding to the incident light pattern, and plating the substrate in the area activated by the light after exposure. By providing a maskless pattern generator, the invention advantageously eliminates {{the problems associated with}} using masks for photo stimulated etching, <b>patterning</b> <b>glass,</b> and photoselective metal deposition...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPerception {{of global}} {{structure}} conveyed in static <b>Glass</b> <b>patterns</b> is difficult, though not impossible, when the constituent dipoles are formed by partnering opposite polarity dots. We investigate whether {{the addition of}} motion signals to opposite-polarity <b>Glass</b> <b>patterns</b> can act to restore the perception of global structure. The stimuli were concentric <b>Glass</b> <b>patterns</b> consisting of 200 dipoles concentrically orientated, or oriented at random orientations, placed on a grey background. For each dipole, one luminance-increment dot (Weber contrast of 1) was paired with another dot set to a contrast ranging between luminance increment and luminance decrement (i. e., a Weber contrast range of approximately − 1 to 1). Dipoles were either stationary (Experiment 1), or randomly re-positioned at 17 Hz (Experiment 2), on each frame transition. A two-interval forced-choice paradigm, in conjunction with an adaptive staircase, was used to obtain Glass-pattern detection thresholds. The task required observers to identify the interval that contained concentric Glass structure; the other interval contained randomly orientated dipoles. Generally, lower global form thresholds were observed for dynamic and same-polarity <b>Glass</b> <b>patterns</b> than for static and opposite-polarity <b>Glass</b> <b>patterns.</b> In particular, for dynamic presentations improvement in sensitivity was more evident for opposite-polarity than for same-polarity <b>Glass</b> <b>patterns.</b> These findings suggest that motion {{plays an important role}} in the detection of global structure in dynamic <b>Glass</b> <b>patterns...</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{temporal}} <b>patterns</b> of <b>glass</b> eels catches {{near the}} mouth of the Poigar River differed among species and years suggesting that there was considerable inter-annual variation in the recruitment <b>patterns</b> of <b>glass</b> eels in the region. However, such systematic surveys for tropical glass eels have never been conducted in other tropical regions. Further long-term surveys should be urgently needed to understand natural (e.g. ambient environments such as global climate change and oceanic transportation systems) and anthropogenic impacts (e.g. overexploitation, habitat degradation and pollution) on the recruitment of glass eels in tropical regions.|$|R
