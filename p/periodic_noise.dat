50|$|A common {{source of}} <b>periodic</b> <b>noise</b> in an image is from {{electrical}} or electromechanical interference during the image capturing process. An image affected by <b>periodic</b> <b>noise</b> {{will look like}} a repeating pattern has been added {{on top of the}} original image. In the frequency domain this type of noise can be seen as discrete spikes. Significant reduction of this noise can be achieved by applying notch filters in the frequency domain. The following images illustrate an image affected by <b>periodic</b> <b>noise,</b> and the result of reducing the noise using frequency domain filtering. Note that the filtered image still has some noise on the borders. Further filtering could reduce this border noise, however it may also reduce some of the fine details in the image. The trade-off between noise reduction and preserving fine details is application specific. For example if the fine details on the castle are not considered important, further low pass filtering could be an appropriate option. If the fine details of the castle are considered important, a viable solution may be to crop off the border of the image entirely.|$|E

Although the main concepts of the devices are similar, using this design allows for the advantages of the TFT to be utilized.

Most of the atomic clocks are having random-stochastic <b>noises</b> and <b>periodic</b> <b>noises</b> due to temperature variation.

However, in this paper, an effort is made to identify and analyze the deterministic trends of both random-stochastic <b>noises</b> and <b>periodic</b> <b>noises</b> due to variation in temperature using an alternate approach of least-squares normalized-error (LSNE) regression algorithm. A MATLAB based application with graphical user interface (GUI) is developed to estimate and analyze random-stochastic <b>noises</b> and <b>periodic</b> <b>noises</b> and re-estimate the stability of rubidium atomic clock after removing these noises from the raw phase data. The {{estimation of}} stationary noises are done using Allan variance from time domain data and noise profile is calculated using curve fit method.

The Periodic Steady-State or PSS analysis directly computed the periodic steady-state response of a circuit. The periodic small-signal analyses use the periodic steady-state solution as a periodically time-varying operating point and linearize the circuit about that operating point and then computes {{the response of}} the circuit to small perturbation sources. Effectively they build a periodically time-varying linear model of the circuit. This is significant as periodically time-varying linear models, unlike the time-invariant linear models used by the traditional small-signal analyses (AC and noise) exhibit frequency conversion. SpectreRF pioneered a variety of periodic small-signal analyses, including periodic AC (pac), <b>periodic</b> <b>noise</b> (pnoise), periodic transfer function (pxf), periodic s-parameter (psp) and periodic stability (pstb).|$|E
50|$|Protection of a 3-dimension zone {{requires}} many microphones and speakers, {{making it}} more expensive. Noise reduction is more easily achieved with a single listener remaining stationary but if there are multiple listeners or if the single listener turns his head or moves throughout the space then the noise reduction challenge is made much more difficult. High frequency waves are difficult to reduce in three dimensions due to their relatively short audio wavelength in air. The wavelength in air of sinusoidal noise at approximately 800 Hz is double {{the distance of the}} average person's left ear to the right ear; such a noise coming directly from the front will be easily reduced by an active system but coming from the side will tend to cancel at one ear while being reinforced at the other, making the noise louder, not softer. High frequency sounds above 1000 Hz tend to cancel and reinforce unpredictably from many directions. In sum, the most effective noise reduction in three-dimensional space involves low frequency sounds. Commercial applications of 3-D noise reduction include the protection of aircraft cabins and car interiors, but in these situations, protection is mainly limited to the cancellation of repetitive (or <b>periodic)</b> <b>noise</b> such as engine-, propeller- or rotor-induced noise. This is because an engine's cyclic nature makes fast Fourier transform analysis and the noise cancellation easier to apply.|$|E

40|$|<b>Periodic</b> <b>noise</b> is {{a common}} problem in many digital sensors, {{limiting}} their performance. The general {{aim of the research}} of which this work forms part is to use CMOS sensors in dual energy X-ray mammography. This imaging methodology requires the subtraction of two subsequent images, and it was observed that the resulting image is severely affected by this type of noise. Therefore, methods to reduce <b>periodic</b> <b>noise</b> are required as a preliminary step in the project. This study proposes a software solution to reduce <b>periodic</b> <b>noise,</b> in the form of three cross-shaped notch-reject frequency filters, namely brick wall, Gaussian and interpolation. The suggested filters have been applied during the optical characterisation of a CMOS active pixel sensor, named "Large Area Sensor" (LAS). The optical characterisation methods used were the "photon transfer" and "nonlinear compensation" methods. The former was used to calculate an input parameter for the latter method, which is considered sufficiently precise for a CMOS imager, because it takes into account its inherent nonlinearity. The above filters gave similar results using both the aforementioned methods. Using the latter method, {{it was found that the}} <b>periodic</b> <b>noise</b> limited the calculation of the performance parameters of the LAS. More specifically, it leads to an underestimation of the sensor's signal and noise gains by 7 % and 13 %, respectively. However, its biggest effect is the overestimation of the read noise by 29 %. Finally, it underestimated the sensor's full well capacity and dynamic range by 9 % and 4 dB, respectively. © 2010 Elsevier B. V...|$|E

The major improvement is a multi-scale analysis which extends the range of F 0 that can be correctly processed.

Secondly, a modification of the lag-window method itself improves its robustness to <b>periodic</b> <b>noises</b> (while loosing its gainindependence property). Thirdly, a rescaling is introduced to permit a full Dynamic Programming search for the optimal F 0 curve. Finally, a mathematically justified peak interpolation is proposed for replacing the conventional, inaccurate parabolic interpolation.

Therefore, according to the characteristics of entropy, the energy of the R continuous frames in each frequency point also follows: when speech appears in some of the R continuous frames, the entropy always becomes smaller than that in the case where all of the R continuous frames are noise frame. Therefore, it is reasonable to track the speech via the change of entropy. So in this paper, a modified DD approach based on the change of entropy (DDBSE) is proposed for a priori SNR estimation. Moreover, considering the importance of noise estimation for speech enhancement, a noise estimation approach based on unbiased MMSE and VAD (UMVAD) is presented.|$|E

40|$|In a {{previous}} article (Duifhuis, 1970) results' concerning the audibility of harmonics in a periodic pulse have been presented. Each {{of the lower}} harmonics could be perceived separately, whereas the high harmonics were heard together as one complex signal. High harmonics, however, appeared to be perceptible as a part-tone (see P. 12) they were spectrally suppressed. This phenomenon was attributed to time analysis, the resolving power of which increases with decreasing frequency resolution, and conversely. The present experiment is meant to give additional {{evidence in support of}} the previous findings. Therefore, we carried out a similar experiment using stimuli having the same frequency amplitude spectrum as the periodic pulse, but with a different time pattern. For these stimuli we chose a special type of pseudo-random binary noise, built up out of maximum length sequences (see, e. g., Golomb, 1967; Bilsen, 1967). The period T of the noise was variable. For the sequence length we chose 27 - 1 127. This value determines the envelope of the frequency amplitude spectrum of the <b>periodic</b> <b>noise.</b> With the chosen value this spectrum is flat up to the 50 th harmonic. The difference with a periodic pulse is found in the phase spectrum (and in the time pattern). The phases of the harmonics of <b>periodic</b> <b>noise</b> are pseudo-randomly distributed whereas the harmonics of a periodic pulse have equal phases.
