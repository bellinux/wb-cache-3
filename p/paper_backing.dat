The work is a watercolor painting on ivory, thin enough for light to shine through and thus allow the depicted breasts to [...] "glow". This medium was common for American miniatures, but in this case also served as a simile for the flesh presented upon it.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1989 {{interview}} with a Japanese newspaper, James Randi {{was quoted as saying}} that Geller had driven a scientist to [...] "shoot himself in the head" [...] after finding out that Geller had fooled him. Randi afterwards claimed it was a metaphor lost in translation. The story was also repeated in a Canadian newspaper, which quoted Randi as saying essentially the same thing: [...] "One scientist, a metallurgist, wrote a <b>paper</b> <b>backing</b> Geller's claims that he could bend metal. The scientist shot himself after I showed him how the key bending trick was done." [...] In 1990, Geller sued Randi in a Japanese court over the statements published in the Japanese newspaper. Randi claims that he could not afford to defend himself, therefore he lost the case by default. The court declared Randi's statement an [...] "insult" [...] as opposed to libel, and awarded a token judgement against Randi, only [...] "one-third of one-percent of what he'd demanded". Since the charge of [...] "insult" [...] is only recognized in Chinese and Japanese law, Randi was not required to pay. Later in 1995 Geller agreed not to pursue payment of the Japanese fine. Randi maintains that he has never paid even one dollar or even one cent to Geller.|$|E

They might throw that {{magazine}} away any minute. I lay awake waiting until I judged it must be about two o'clock in the morning. Then I got up as softly as I could, and felt in the dark along the left-hand wall. Very gently, I unhooked one of the pictures from its nail--Marguerite with her casket of jewels. I crept over to my coat and took out the magazine, and an odd envelope or two that I had shoved in. Then I went to the washstand, and damped the brown paper {{at the back of the}} picture all round. Presently I was able to pull it away. I had already torn out the two stuck-together pages from the magazine, and now I slipped them with their precious enclosure between the picture and its brown <b>paper</b> <b>backing.</b> A little gum from the envelopes helped me to stick the latter up again. No one would dream the picture had ever been tampered with. I rehung it on the wall, put the magazine back in my coat pocket, and crept back to bed. I was pleased with my hiding-place. They'd never think of pulling to pieces one of their own pictures. I hoped that they'd come to the conclusion that Danvers had been carrying a dummy all along, and that, in the end, they'd let me go.|$|E
