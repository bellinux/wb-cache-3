40|$|AbstractIntroduction: {{life quality}} which has {{attracted}} the attention of researchers in recent years has a concept wider than health. According to the world sanitation organization life quality is ‚Äúthe self-perception of a person in his/her life, in the culture and value systems in which the person is living, in relation to his/her goals, expectations, standards and interests‚Äù. Life quality includes: the dimensions of bodily and psychological health, the amount of independency, social relationships, and the relationship with environment, spirituality and personal believes. Aim: {{the purpose of this study}} is to predict the students‚Äô life quality on the basis of life skills. Methods: the method of this study is descriptive-corelational. the statistical population of the study includes all the students of Babol payam-e-noor university who are studying in this university from 2010 - 2011. in the statistical sample of this study 220 of the students were selected by clustered sampling methodology. The instruments used in this study include Golzari life skills and world <b>sanitary</b> <b>organization</b> life quality questionnaires. For statistical analysis SPSS software was used. Findings: the results show that there is a significant relationship between the total score of life quality and the total score of life skills and also most of its scales. In other words the increase of the awareness of the students of life skills leads to the improvement of life quality. Conclusion: considering the findings it worth mentioning that, by having enough information about life skills and using them in daily life, people are able to encounter the problems and it also causes them to have a stronger personality and increases their vision about life and its events. It also leads to the increase of skill in running life and also increases of skill in relationship with the environment and people and finally leads to life satisfaction...|$|R

40|$|La evoluci√≥n de la salud p√∫blica en Espa√±a durante el siglo XIX se puede dividir en tres etapas bien diferenciadas. En la primera (1812 - 1833), el reinado de Fernando VII impidi√≥ el desarrollo de los postulados liberales: ¬´la autonom√≠a de los ayuntamientos {{en materia}} de higiene y salud p√∫blica¬ª. La segunda (1833 - 1873) se caracteriza por el desarrollo legislativo de la organizaci√≥n sanitaria espa√±ola. Como consecuencia de este nuevo marco legislativo, y en el contexto del higienismo (¬´la desigualdad social como origen de la enfermedad¬ª), aparecen las figuras de los sanitarios locales (facultativos titulares) contratados por los ayuntamientos para encargarse de la asistencia m√©dica de los pobres (m√©dico titular), de la asistencia farmac√©utica de los pobres (farmac√©utico titular) y de la inspecci√≥n sanitaria de la carne de los mataderos (veterinario titular). La tercera (1873 - 1904) viene con el {{principio}} de una nueva era (la microbiolog√≠a) y el inicio del m√©todo cient√≠fico. La microbiolog√≠a impulsa por todo el Estado la creaci√≥n de los Laboratorios Municipales, y sienta las bases que dar√°n origen, a principios del siglo XX, a la creaci√≥n de los Cuerpos Sanitarios de Medicina, Farmacia y Veterinaria con una estructura organizativa bien definida y unas atribuciones m√°s amplias. The evolution {{of public health}} in Spain during the 19 th century {{can be divided into}} three stages. In the first stage (1812 - 1833), the reign of Fernando VII prevented the development of the liberal postulates: ¬´the autonomy of the city councils in the matter of hygiene and public health¬ª. The second stage (1833 - 1873), was characterized by the legislative development of <b>sanitary</b> <b>organization</b> in Spain. As a result of this new legislative framework, and in the context of social hygiene (¬´social inequality as the origin of disease¬ª), the figures of municipal health professionals appeared, engaged by the city councils {{to be in charge of}} the medical assistance of the poor (municipal physician), of the pharmaceutical assistance of the poor (municipal pharmacist), and of the health inspection of meat from the slaughterhouses (municipal veterinarian). The third stage (1873 - 1904), marked the beginning of a new age (microbiology) and the beginning of the scientific method.

METHODS Socio-historical study (1981 - 1989), based on Bordieu&# 8217;s genetic sociology, by document analysis, bibliographical review, and in-depth interviews. It consisted of a connection between the analysis of the paths of 33 agents involved {{in the creation of a}} social space focusing on AIDS-related issues and the historical possibility conditions of the drafting of a specific policy. RESULTS AIDS Space is a gathering point for the paths of agents from several social fields (medical, scientific, political, and bureaucratic fields). A specific space for relationships, which enabled the drafting of a policy for controlling the AIDS epidemic, but also a place where the authority to talk about the meaning of the disease, the methods to prevent and treat it was under dispute. The analysis showed how the various structures (democratic administrations in Sao Paulo and at the national level, with public health officers taking important positions) and the lack of a specific therapy contributed to social agents of different ranks and backgrounds to initially set prevention as a priority.

In her book Learning from the Wounded: The Civil War and the Rise of American Medicine, historian Shauna DeVine argues that the Civil War was not a medical dead-end but rather a catalyst for innovation that fundamentally altered medical practice.

40|$|The World Trade <b>Organization</b> <b>Sanitary</b> and Phytosanitary Agreement (SPS Agreement) {{relies heavily}} on science and expert {{organizations}} to avoid and resolve trade disputes over measures enacted under the rationale of food safety or plant and animal health protection. However, the state of science for sanitary and phytosanitary risk analysis is highly uncertain, and the SPS Agreement leaves many science policy issues unsettled. The international agencies charged under the SPS Agreement with harmonizing standards and forging international scientific consensus face a daunting and politically-charged task. Two case studies are briefly developed. In the first case, the international scientific consensus strongly supports the U. S. challenge of the European Union‚Äôs ban on cattle growth hormones, but {{the root causes of}} the dispute go much deeper. The case suggests that establishing a precedent for SPS measures based solely on "sound science" may be a slippery objective. In the second case, domestic avocado producers challenged a U. S. Department of Agriculture assessment which concluded that a partial lifting of the ban on Mexican avocado imports posed a negligible plant pest risk. Although the Department‚Äôs phytosanitary risk assessment gained endorsement by independent scientists, a contributing factor to resolving this dispute was the threat of retaliation against U. S. agricultural exports to Mexico. A recent survey of current and proposed technical barriers to U. S. agricultural exports suggests that the trade impacts could approach $ 5 billion a year and that the most common SPS disputes in the future will be over biological hazardsÔøΩparticularly plant pests and food-borne microbial pathogens. This poses a tremendous challenge, however, because the practice of risk assessment for biological stressors is much less developed than that for chemical substances. The paper concludes with some proposed criteria for evaluating the weight of scientific evidence in SPS risk assessment. ...|$|R
40|$|Alongside {{climate change}} and habitat loss, aquatic nonindigenous species (ANS) {{introductions}} comprise a large and increasing contribution of the anthropogenic threat to environmental,economic, sociocultural and human health values worldwide. Biosecurity agencies aim to prevent and manage introductions using various tools, including risk assessment. Risk assessment can prioritize threats, but is frequently compromised by uncertainty, often due to information availability, quality and interpretation. Many risk assessment processes lack consistent and transparent treatment of uncertainty, particularly when biosecurity objectives warrant a precautionary approach. This thesis aims to identify methods for managing uncertainty via an initial review of 14 existing national, regional and international biosecurity instruments. Results from this review found {{over half of the}} instruments explicitly included or mentioned precaution, and many instruments acknowledged the potential influence of subjective risk perceptions. Based on these outcomes, this thesis aims to: determine sources of uncertainty; understand the cognitive process of estimating consequence, and therefore risk under uncertainty; and provide transparent methods to reduce uncertainty that allow for precaution, using input from ANS experts in scientific and management fields. Finally, this thesis aims to examine how the frequentist statistical focus on low acceptable rates of Type I errors, most frequently applied in ANS impact research, influences findings of significant impact and the implications for management decisions. Results of this thesis indicate that the scarcity of ANS impact information constitutes a primary source of uncertainty. When faced with knowledge gaps and other forms of uncertainty, experts tended to assume and assign lower consequence via a ‚Äòhindsight approach‚Äô (assume no impact without sufficient information), which stands opposite to precaution. To mitigate the effects of uncertainty, experts supported the use of alternative information sources, including non-empirical evidence. In practice, the provision of information and group discussion generally increased the consequence estimate, thus suggesting methods that allow functional and, if desired, precautionary consequence assessments despite high uncertainty. In situations of expected ‚Äòlow‚Äô certainty, when information is available, my research indicated that an extremely high proportion of statistical analyses of impact had insufficient power to detect an impact, leading to ‚Äòfalse certainty‚Äô of no impact. This bias toward ‚Äòmissing‚Äô impacts, again opposite to precaution, may further prevent appropriate management action. The thesis concludes with a proposed framework that provides guidance for biosecurity-related research and management using an acceptable level of risk. It provides a transparent process and usable risk outcomes that: (1) integrate scientific process and management objectives; (2) are accountable for and unimpeded by uncertainty; (3) consider the assumptions used by the experts making the assessment; (4) can be adapted according to varying strengths of precaution desired by management; (5) follows World Trade <b>Organization</b> <b>Sanitary</b> and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement mandates; and (6) are feasible given time and budget constraints...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{book about}} the ever more complex legal {{networks}} of transnational economic governance structures and their legitimacy problems. The book takes up the challenge of the editors' earlier pioneering works which have called for more cross-sectoral and interdisciplinary analysis by scholars of international law, European and international economic law, private international law, international relations theory, and social philosophy to examine the interdependence of multilevel governance in transnational economic, social, environmental, and legal relations. Two complementary strands of theorizing are expounded. One argues that globalization and the universal recognition of human rights are transforming the intergovernmental 'society of states' into a cosmopolitan community of citizens which requires more effective constitutional safeguards for protecting human rights and consumer welfare in the national and international governance and legal regulation of international trade. The second emphasizes the dependence of the functioning of international markets and liberal trade on governance arrangements which respond credibly to safety and environmental concerns of consumers, traders, politicians, and non-governmental actors. Inquiries into the generation of international standards and empirical analysis of legalization practices form part of this agenda. The perspectives and conclusions of the more than 20 contributors from Europe and North America cannot be uniform. But they converge in their search for a constitutional architecture which limits, empowers, and legitimizes multilevel trade governance, as well as in their common premise that respect for human rights, private and democratic self-government, and social justice require more transparent, participatory, and deliberative forms of transnational 'cosmopolitan democracy'.

40|$|Is an {{increase}} in the quality of health services, as perceived by the hospital, appreciated by the consumers? If so, patients should respond positively to {{an increase}} in the quality of hospital services. Using two indicators to capture the quality of hospital services I investigate the relationship between these indicators and inpatients experiences. 	The health sector has increased substantially in most OECD countries over the last few decades. In Norway, total health care expenditures as a percentage share of the GDP, has grown from 2. 9 % in 1960 to 8. 7 % in 2002. 	In 2002 the state took over ownership of the Norwegian hospital sector and organized it through five regional semiautonomous companies. The motivation behind this was more efficient use of hospital resources, equal access despite geographical differences, and a higher quality of health services. 	Cost efficiency, measured as total activity relative to total costs, decreased during the 1990 s. Part of the decrease can be explained by increased labour costs. It is often assumed that decreasing costs lead to lower quality. If this is the case in the health sector, one would expect to see a higher level of quality when costs per patient increase. 	Health services are paid for by taxpayers who are also the users of these services. For this reason, and especially since costs have increased, {{they should be able to}} evaluate the quality of the services they receive. This leads to an important question: What aspects of quality are important to consumers of health services? Do quality indicators, such as readmission rates and waiting time, capture the quality that consumers demand? This thesis is an attempt to answer these questions. 	The method I use is standard OLS. I also investigate possible cross-effects between hospitals readmission rates and age and look at the effect of a one standard deviation change in four of the explanatory variables. I also consider the use of an alternative estimation method that allows for stronger correlation between patients within hospitals but assumes independence between patients at different hospitals. The estimations are done using the statistical package StataSE 8. 	Using a simple regression model I have investigated the relationship between patients experiences during a hospital admission and the readmission rate and mean waiting time at the hospital they were admitted to. The data on these two hospital specific variables were provided by SINTEF Health who runs the Norwegian Patient Register. The register is owned by the Directorate of Health and Social Affairs. 	The data on patient satisfaction with hospital services were taken from an anonymous survey among patients admitted to somatic hospitals. They received the surveys two to three weeks after discharge. The response rate was approximately 50 %. The questions in the survey concerned issues such as health personnel s ability to convey and receive relevant information, as well as provide care, treatment, and pain relief. There were also questions on patients impression of hospital equipment, general standard, and facilities and sanitary conditions. 	The survey consisted of 50 questions that I grouped into seven category variables, according to the type of service the different questions concerned. These categories were content, info, info 2, facisani, care, org, and improve. Patients were also asked about their gender, age, health status, education level, number of admissions last two years, and whether their first language was Scandinavian. I was thus able to control for these characteristics. 	My main empirical finding is that hospitals readmission rates have a negative and significant effect on inpatients experiences. Patients admitted to hospitals with low readmission rates are more content with the care, treatment, and information they receive from hospital personnel. They are also more content with hospital facilities and <b>sanitary</b> conditions and <b>organization</b> of hospital staff. 	The results for waiting time were more ambiguous. Patients impression of hospitals facilities and sanitary conditions was better at hospitals with longer waiting time. It may be that other quality aspects are better at these hospitals, and that these other aspects are more important for patient satisfaction. 	Patients age, health status, number of previous admissions, and education level significantly affected their satisfaction with hospital services. The age effect was positive but decreasing. Investigating the cross-effect between age and the readmission rate showed that younger patients respond more negatively to a given readmission rate than older patients. Patient satisfaction decreased with the number of admissions and with patients education level but increased with patients health status. 	Patient characteristics explained the main share of the variation in patients experiences. Including dummies for hospitals increased the share of variation explained indicating that there are hospital specific factors present that affect patient satisfaction. Of this increase readmissions and waiting time explained a small part. More precise measures of hospital level quality may be needed in order to capture more of this variation...|$|R
