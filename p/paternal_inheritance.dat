5|$|During {{the rule}} of the Aryacakravarti rulers, the laws {{governing}} the society was based on a compromise between a matriarchal system of society that seemed to have had deeper roots overlaid with a patriarchal system of governance. These laws seemed to have existed side by side as customary laws to be interpreted by the local Mudaliars. In some aspects such as in inheritance the similarity to Marumakattayam law of present-day Kerala and Aliyasanatana of modern Tulunadu was noted by later scholars. Further Islamic jurisprudence and Hindu laws of neighboring India also seemed to have affected the customary laws. These customary laws were later codified and put to print during the Dutch colonial rule as Thesavalamai in 1707. The rule under earlier customs seemed to have been females succeeded females. But when the structure of the society came to be based on patriarchal system, a corresponding rule was recognized, that males succeeded males. Thus, we see the devolution of muthusam (<b>paternal</b> <b>inheritance)</b> was on the sons, and the devolution of the chidenam (dowry or maternal inheritance) was on the females. Just as one dowried sister succeeded another, we had the corresponding rule that if one’s brother died instate, his properties devolved upon his brothers to the exclusion of his sisters. The reason being that in a patriarchal family each brother formed a family unit, but all the brothers being agnates, when one of them died his property devolved upon his agnates.|$|E
5|$|An individual's {{mitochondrial}} {{genes are}} not inherited {{by the same}} mechanism as nuclear genes. Typically, the mitochondria are inherited from one parent only. In humans, when an egg cell is fertilized by a sperm, the egg nucleus and sperm nucleus each contribute equally to the genetic makeup of the zygote nucleus. In contrast, the mitochondria, and therefore the mitochondrial DNA, usually come from the egg only. The sperm's mitochondria enter the egg, but do not contribute genetic information to the embryo. Instead, paternal mitochondria are marked with ubiquitin to select them for later destruction inside the embryo. The egg cell contains relatively few mitochondria, but it is these mitochondria that survive and divide to populate {{the cells of the}} adult organism. Mitochondria are, therefore, in most cases inherited only from mothers, a pattern known as maternal inheritance. This mode is seen in most organisms, including the majority of animals. However, mitochondria in some species can sometimes be inherited paternally. This is the norm among certain coniferous plants, although not in pine trees and yews. For Mytilids, <b>paternal</b> <b>inheritance</b> only occurs within males of the species. It has been suggested that it occurs at a very low level in humans. There is a recent suggestion that mitochondria that shorten male lifespan stay in the system because they are inherited only through the mother. By contrast, natural selection weeds out mitochondria that reduce female survival as such mitochondria {{are less likely to be}} passed on to the next generation. Therefore, it is suggested that human females and female animals tend to live longer than males. The authors claim that this is a partial explanation.|$|E

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{strategic}} geographic location between three different continents, Sicily and Southern Italy have long represented a major Mediterranean crossroad where different peoples and cultures came together over time. However, its multi-layered history of migration pathways and cultural exchanges, {{has made the}} reconstruction of its genetic history and population structure extremely controversial and widely debated. To address this debate, we surveyed the genetic variability of 326 accurately selected individuals from 8 different provinces of Sicily and Southern Italy, through a comprehensive evaluation of both Y-chromosome and mtDNA genomes. The main goal {{was to investigate the}} structuring of maternal and paternal genetic pools within Sicily and Southern Italy, and to examine their degrees of interaction with other Mediterranean populations. Our findings show high levels of within-population variability, coupled with the lack of significant genetic sub-structures both within Sicily, as well as between Sicily and Southern Italy. When Sicilian and Southern Italian populations were contextualized within the Euro-Mediterranean genetic space, we observed different historical dynamics for maternal and <b>paternal</b> <b>inheritances.</b> Y-chromosome results highlight a significant genetic differentiation between the North-Western and South-Eastern part of the Mediterranean, the Italian Peninsula occupying an intermediate position therein.

25|$|On {{the death}} of Bertha in early 1156, her son, Conan IV, {{expected}} to inherit the ducal throne. However, he was denied his inheritance by his stepfather Odo, Viscount of Porhoët (also known as Odo II), Bertha's second husband; Odo II refused to relinquish his authority over Brittany. To consolidate his hold on power, Odo II entered into a pact with the disinherited Hoel, Count of Nantes, to divide Brittany between them. But at the same time, Hoel was under threat of rebellion in Nantes, sponsored by Geoffrey Fitzempress, {{and he could not}} send any aid to Eudas. Conan IV landed in Brittany and took Rennes, while his ally Raoul de Fougères captured and imprisoned Eudas. Conan IV was formally enthroned as Duke of Brittany in Rennes. While Conan IV was consolidating his inheritance in 1156, Geoffrey FitzEmpress successfully took Nantes from Hoel. On Geoffrey's death in 1158, Conan IV seized Nantes, reuniting the Duchy once again. However, Henry II, now King of England, seized the Earldom of Richmond, Conan's <b>paternal</b> <b>inheritance.</b> Henry demanded the return of Nantes, and when he obtained control of it from Conan IV, became the Count of Nantes, without obligation to the Duke of Brittany (later dukes would eventually reunite Nantes to Brittany).|$|E
500|$|When Henry II {{was born}} in 1133, his grandfather, Henry I, was {{reportedly}} delighted, saying that the boy was [...] "the heir to the kingdom". The birth reduced {{the risk that the}} King's realm would pass to his son-in-law's family, which might have occurred if the marriage of Matilda and Geoffrey had proved childless. The birth of a second son, also named Geoffrey, increased the likelihood that, in accordance with French custom, Henry would receive the English maternal inheritance and Geoffrey the Angevin <b>paternal</b> <b>inheritance.</b> This would separate the realms of England and Anjou. In order to secure an orderly succession, Geoffrey and Matilda sought more power from Henry I, but quarrelled with him after the King refused to give them power that might be used against him. When he died in December 1135, the couple were in Anjou, allowing Matilda's cousin Stephen to seize the crown of England. Stephen's contested accession initiated the widespread civil unrest later called the Anarchy.|$|E
500|$|As society {{became more}} prosperous and stable in the 11th century, {{inheritance}} customs developed [...] that allowed daughters (in {{the absence of}} sons) to succeed to principalities as well as landed estates. The twelfth-century chronicler Ralph de Diceto noted that the counts of Anjou extended their dominion over their neighbours by marriage rather than conquest. The marriage of Geoffrey to {{the daughter of a}} king (and widow of an emperor) occurred in this context. [...] It is unknown whether King Henry intended to make Geoffrey his heir, but it is known that the threat presented by William Clito’s rival claim to the duchy of Normandy made his negotiating position very weak. Even so, it is probable that, should the marriage be childless, King Henry would have attempted to be succeeded by one of his Norman kinsmen such as Theobald II, Count of Champagne or Stephen of Blois who in the event did seize King Henry’s English crown. King Henry’s great relief in 1133 at the birth of a son to the couple, described as [...] "the heir to the Kingdom", is understandable in the light of this situation. Following this the birth of a second son raised the question of whether custom would be followed with the maternal inheritance passing to first born and the <b>paternal</b> <b>inheritance</b> going to his brother, Geoffrey.|$|E
40|$|The centrosome, the microtubule-organizing {{center of}} the cell, is {{introduced}} typically by the sperm at fertilization. In some mammals, however, this <b>paternal</b> pattern of <b>inheritance</b> appears to be violated. The hypothesis that the centrosome is maternally inherited was tested during parthenogenesis, polyspermy, and polygyny as well as after recovery from microtubule inhibition at first mitosis. During parthenogenesis the paternal contribution was absent, and in polyspermy the paternal contribution was multiplied. Haploid and diploid parthenogenotes as well as polyspermic and digynic fertilized eggs each segregated their centrosomes to organize a bipolar mitotic apparatus. Oocytes recovering from a nocodazole block formed two normal bipolar mitotic apparatus; the paternal chromosomes aligned at one spindle equator, while the maternal chromosomes were found at the other. These {{results show that the}} centrosome is maternally inherited from cytoplasmic sites in the mouse.

40|$|We {{continue}} our {{study of the}} effects of pollen and seed migration on the cytonuclear structure of mixed-mating plant populations by analyzing two deterministic continent-island models under the critical assumption of <b>paternal</b> cytoplasmic <b>inheritance.</b> The major results of this study that contrast with our previous conclusions based on maternal cytoplasmic inheritance are (i) pollen gene flow can significantly affect the cytonuclear structure of the island population, and in particular can help to generate cytonuclear disequilibria that greatly exceed the magnitude of those that would be produced by seed migration or mixed mating alone; (ii) with simultaneous pollen and seed migration, nonzero cytonuclear disequilibria will be maintained not only when there is disequilibrium in the immigrant pollen or seeds, but also through a variety of intermigrant admixture effects when the two pools of immigrants differ appropriately in their cytonuclear compositions; (iii) either immigrant pollen or immigrant seeds can generate disequilibria de novo in populations with initially random cytonuclear associations, but pollen migration alone generally produces lower levels of disequilibrium than does comparable seed migration, especially at high levels of self-fertilization when the overall fraction of immigrant pollen is low; (iv) the equilibrium state of the island population will be influenced by the rate of pollen gene flow whenever there is either allelic disequilibrium in the immigrant pollen or simultaneous seed migration coupled with different cytoplasmic or nuclear allele frequencies in immigrant pollen and seeds or nonzero allelic disequilibrium in either immigrant pool. The estimation of pollen migration should therefore be facilitated with <b>paternal</b> cytoplasmic <b>inheritance</b> relative to the case of maternal cytoplasmic inheritance. These basic conclusions hold whether the population is censused as seeds or as adults, but with simultaneous pollen and seed migration, the relationship between census time and the ability to detect nonrandom cytonuclear associations is complex.

40|$|A new maximum-likelihood {{method is}} {{developed}} for estimating unidirectional pollen and seed flow in mixed-mating plant populations from counts of joint nuclear-cytoplasmic genotypes. Data may include multiple unlinked nuclear markers {{with a single}} maternally or paternally inherited cytoplasmic marker, or with two cytoplasmic markers inherited through opposite parents, as in many conifer species. Migration rate estimates are based on fitting the equilibrium genotype frequencies under continent-island models of plant gene flow to the data. Detailed analysis of their equilibrium structures indicates when {{each of the three}} nuclear-cytoplasmic systems allows gene flow estimation and shows that, in general, it is easier to estimate seed than pollen migration. Three-locus nuclear-dicytoplasmic data only increase the conditions allowing seed migration estimates; however, the additional dicytonuclear disequilibria allow more accurate estimates of both forms of gene flow. Estimates and their confidence limits for simulated data sets confirm that two-locus data with <b>paternal</b> cytoplasmic <b>inheritance</b> provide better estimates than those with maternal inheritance, while three-locus dicytonuclear data with three modes of inheritance generally provide the most reliable estimates for both types of gene flow.

However, the sperm cells are only surrounded by plasma membranes without cell walls. The larger leading sperm cell in a pollen tube section is long in shape, with a large amount of cytoplasm; while the second sperm cell is smaller, round in shape and contains less cytoplasm.
