2500|$|The Bird of Paradise {{completed}} its flight to Hawaii in 25 hours and 50 minutes. A detachment of military police, including mounted M.P.s from nearby Schofield Barracks, surrounded the C-2 {{to protect it}} from the crowd. The flyers climbed out of their airplane to [...] be greeted by various dignitaries that included the Wheeler Field base commander Maj. Henry J.F. Miller, the Hawaiian Department commanding general Edward M. Lewis, then-Territorial Governor Wallace R. Farrington (Hawaii would become a state in 1959), the stunt man Dick Grace, and their mutual friend 1st Lt. John Griffith, who found the misplaced food when he inspected the aircraft—beneath Hegenberger's <b>plotting</b> <b>board</b> under a tarpaulin.|$|E
2500|$|The Martin AN/FSG-1 Antiaircraft Defense System, {{better known}} as Missile Master, was an {{electronic}} fire distribution center to computerize Cold War air defense (AD) command posts from manual <b>plotting</b> <b>board</b> operations to automated command and control of remote surface-to-air missile (SAM) launch batteries. The 10 United States Army C3 systems used radar [...] ("electronic umbrella") at Missile Master military installations for coordinating ground-controlled interception by Nike and MIM-23 Hawk missiles. [...] The vacuum tube fire control logic reduced the time to designate the appropriate missile battery to launch if an enemy target had intruded into a defense area where an AN/FSG-1 system was deployed.|$|E
2500|$|At the Group HQs another <b>plotting</b> <b>board,</b> {{covering}} {{only the}} area of interest to that Group, re-created the plots from FCHQ via position reports sent to them over the telephone. This allowed the Groups to re-create the map, but on a scale and location more suitable to their area of operations. Since the information was being pre-filtered, these maps {{did not have to}} be changed as often, and a somewhat simpler marker solution was adopted. Small wooden blocks with tags were placed on the map to represent the location of various formations, indicated by the ID number created in the filter room. The tags indicated the ID number, friend or foe status if known ("H" [...] meant [...] "hostile, F for [...] "friendly"), the estimated number of aircraft, and their altitude. The colour of the altitude tags indicated when the report was updated, matching the same sector clock pattern used at FCHQ. This allowed observers to quickly determine whether or not a plot was up to date, and request updates if needed. If a target was assigned squadrons for interception, these were indicated with cocktail stick-like tags with the squadron number on them.|$|E

There were also procedural improvements, like the use of <b>plotting</b> <b>boards</b> to manually predict {{the position of a}} ship during an engagement. Around 1905, mechanical fire control aids began to become available, such as the Dreyer Table, Dumaresq (which was also part of the Dreyer Table), and Argo Clock, but these devices took a number of years to become widely deployed. These devices were early forms of rangekeepers.|$|R
5000|$|Priority Permanent System: The [...] "Priority Permanent System" [...] {{with the}} initial (priority) radar {{stations}} having new radar systems included [...] "ADC radar site" [...] P-1 at McChord AFB on June 1, 1950. Completed in May 1952 to replace the 1950 Lashup Radar Network, the Priority Permanent System had 5 redesignated LASHUP stations, 23 new stations in 1951 with older radars, 62 stations in 1951 with new equipment, {{and several of the}} 10 newly equipped 1952 stations (including Manassas RP-55). The Priority Permanent System used Manual ADCCs, e.g., with Plexiglas <b>plotting</b> <b>boards</b> as at the 1954 Ent Air Force Base command center for ADC.|$|R
2500|$|Prior to launch, the Missile Tracking Radar (MTR) {{locked on}} to the {{transponder}} in the selected missile. Like the Ajax, the Hercules used a transponder in the missile. A short period after launch the actual location, i.e. azimuth, elevation and range of the missile were displayed on the <b>plotting</b> <b>boards.</b> The firing or launch command was given manually by the Battery Control Officer based on orders or Rules of Engagements. To ensure the MTR could see and track the missile during its initial rapid assent as it launched, the IFC was normally located about [...] from the [...] "Launching Area" [...] (LA). In the case of Hercules, all of the radars were typically mounted on (concrete) elevated platforms to improve their line-of-sight.|$|R
50|$|The {{uncorrected}} firing data, {{to which}} such corrections were applied, were those derived, for instance, from using a <b>plotting</b> <b>board</b> {{to track the}} position of an observed target (e.g., a ship) and the range and azimuth to that target from the guns of a battery.|$|E

5000|$|Using the <b>plotting</b> <b>board</b> {{required}} {{a team of}} five or six soldiers to handle the board itself, five or six more to handle equipment used to correct and adjust the resulting target coordinates and a minimum of four more in the two distant base end stations. Many of the <b>plotting</b> <b>board</b> functions described below were performed repeatedly, during several successive observation/firing intervals (see Figure 1 below, left) that were indicated throughout the harbor defense system by the ringing of time interval bells [...]The process began when a target (e.g., an enemy ship) was identified by the harbor command and assigned to a given gun battery. Observers in the two widely separated base end stations for the chosen battery tracked the target, using either azimuth scopes or more sophisticated depression position finders (DPFs).|$|E

The tactical data links exchange data between other units in the force; i.e., ships, aircraft and other military units such as deployed Army, Air Force, Marine and Coast Guard commands. They operate encrypted and non-encrypted long and short range radio-telephone equipment as well as intra-ship communication systems.|$|R

The MX-1353 and other programs developed the AN/FPS-6, AN/MPS-10, and other Cold War radars ...|$|R
50|$|A {{plotting}} {{room was}} connected by telephone lines (and sometimes by radio) to base end stations (at left, top) that observed {{the locations of}} enemy ships and sent data to plotting room soldiers who used equipment like a <b>plotting</b> <b>board</b> to calculate where the guns should be pointed and {{when they should be}} fired.|$|E

50|$|Early systems {{made use}} of {{multiple}} observation or base end stations (see Figure 1) to find and track targets attacking American harbors. Data from these stations were then passed to plotting rooms, where analog mechanical devices, such as the <b>plotting</b> <b>board,</b> were used to estimate targets' positions and derive firing data for batteries of coastal guns assigned to interdict them.|$|E
5000|$|In 1944, the US Army {{contracted}} for {{an electronic}} [...] "computer with guns, a tracking radar, <b>plotting</b> <b>boards</b> and communications equipment" [...] (M33C & M33D models used different subassemblies for 90 & 120 mm gun/ammunition ballistics.) The [...] "trial model predecessor" [...] (T-33) {{was used as}} late as 1953, and the production M33 (each $383,000 in 1954 dollars) had been deployed in 1950. [...] The 34th AAA Brigade's 90mm guns were converted to the M-33 by December 3, 1954, after the 95th AAA Brigade had been upgraded. Aberdeen Proving Ground and Fort Bliss were training posts for M-33 personnel, and by 1957 there were 3 Ordnance Detachments in Germany for M33 Integrated Fire Control Repair—150th (Wiesbaden), 151st (Mannheim), & 152nd (Kaiserslautern) Ord Det (IFCR); and functional test sites included the White Sands Proving Ground ranges (e.g., [...] "Hueco Range No. 3). The M33 was also used for satellite tracking in 1961.|$|R
5000|$|By 1960, USAF RBS {{equipment}} {{had been}} incorporated in US Army Course Directing Centrals for Project Nike (i.e., receivers for telecommunicated tones {{to indicate the}} aircraft's bomb release on the Nike radar <b>plotting</b> <b>boards).</b> [...] Nike RBS of SAC/ADCOM bombers used USAF personnel on temporary duty to calculate the simulated bomb run score from the track by a Nike missile crew/radar (e.g., at the Chicago-Gary Defense Area). [...] In 1961, Nike units [...] "scored 1,890 practice bomb runs" [...] and in 1962 the NIKE site at Maitland/Lake Park in Milwaukee was RBSing. [...] Four Navy Radar Bomb Scoring Units during the Cold War included those near Spokane, Washington, and at the Pachino Radar Bomb Scoring Range near Naples, Italy. After the 10th Radar Bomb Scoring Squadron's RBS Express train {{had been used in}} 1961 near the Hawthorne Army Ammunition Plant, SAC's Hawthorne Bomb Plot in nearby Babbitt also scored bomb runs of US Navy aircraft (e.g., out of Naval Air Station Fallon).|$|R
5000|$|In 1961, SAC and the U.S. Army began a joint {{training}} mission with benefits for both parties. SAC needed fresh (simulated) targets which the cities ringed by Nike/Hercules sites provided, and the Army needed live targets to acquire and track with their radar. SAC had many Radar Bomb Scoring (RBS) sites {{across the country}} which had very similar acquisition and tracking radar, plus similar computerized <b>plotting</b> <b>boards</b> which were used to record the bomber tracks and bomb release points. Airmen from these sites were assigned TDY to Nike sites {{across the country to}} train the Nike crews in RBS procedures. The distances from the simulated bomb landing point and the [...] "target" [...] were recorded on paper, measured, encoded, and transmitted to the aircrews. The results of these bomb runs were used to promote or demote air crews. ECM activity also took place between the bombers and the Nike sites. The performance of the NIKE crews improved remarkably with this [...] "live target" [...] practice.|$|R
