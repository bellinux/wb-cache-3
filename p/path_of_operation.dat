Initially the 9th Infantry Division made good progress, covering 10 miles in two days (an advance unheard of in the bocage), but German efforts to restore stability to their front caused resistance to stiffen. Beginning on 4 August, the medium tank companies maneuvered with their infantry regimental combat teams {{in an effort to}} dislodge the Germans located between Chérencé-le-Roussel and Gathemo. Instead, beginning in the early morning of 7 August, they found themselves in the <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>Operation</b> Lüttich, a corps-size German armor offensive to split the First and Third Armies and relieve German forces cut off at Avranches. The attack was blunted within a day, but fighting continued until the German leadership called off the attack on 11 August. Despite the size of the forces involved on both sides, the attack devolved into a melee of fierce but disjointed small unit actions. After the tactical situation had been restored, the battalion was once again given a brief opportunity to rest and refit.|$|E
40|$|International audienceGeo-replicated storage {{systems are}} {{at the core of}} current Internet services. Unfortunately, there exists a {{fundamental}} tension between consistency and performance for offering scalable geo-replication. Weakening consistency semantics leads to less coordination and consequently a good user experience, but it may introduce anomalies such as state divergence and invariant violation. In contrast, maintaining stronger consistency precludes anomalies but requires more coordination. This paper discusses two main contributions to address this tension. First, RedBlue Consistency enables blue operations to be fast (and weakly consistent) while the remaining red operations are strongly consistent (and slow). We identify sufficient conditions for determining when operations can be blue or must be red. Second, Explicit Consistency further increases the space of operations that can be fast by restricting the concurrent execution of only the operations that can break application-defined invariants. We further show how to allow operations to complete locally in the common case, by relying on a reservation system that moves coordination off the critical <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> execution...|$|E

Weakly consistent systems enable better performance, but cannot maintain strong application invariants, which strong consistency trivially supports. This paper takes the position {{that it is possible}} to both achieve fast operation and maintain application invariants. To that end, we propose the novel abstraction of invariant-preserving CRDTs, which are replicated objects that provide invariant-safe automatic merging of concurrent updates. The key technique behind the implementation of these CRDTs is to move replica coordination outside the critical <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> execution, to enable low normal case latency while retaining the coordination necessary to enforce invariants. In this paper we present ongoing work, where we show different invariant-preserving CRDTs designs and evaluate the latency <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> using a counter that never goes negative...|$|R

The {{designers}} of the replication protocols used by these systems must choose between either supporting low-latency, eventually-consistent operations, or ensuring strong consistency to ease application correctness.

Given these application-specific invariants, a system that supports Explicit Consistency identifies which operations would be unsafe under concurrent execution, and allows programmers to select either violation-avoidance or invariant-repair techniques. We show how to achieve the former, while allowing operations to complete locally in the common case, by relying on a reservation system that moves coordination off the critical <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> execution. The latter, in turn, allows operations to execute without restriction, and restore invariants by applying a repair operation to the database state.

We model a generator as a system of two degrees of freedom, represented on either the stress–stretch plane or the voltage–charge plane. A point in such a plane represents {{a state of the}} generator, a curve represents a <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> a contour represents a cycle of operation, and the area enclosed by the contour represents the energy of conversion per cycle. Each mechanism of failure is represented by a curve in the plane. The curves of all the known mechanics of failure enclose the region of allowable states. The area of this region defines the maximum energy of conversion. This study includes the following mechanisms of failure: material rupture, loss of tension, electrical breakdown, and electromechanical instability. It is found that natural rubber outperforms VHB elastomer as a generator at strains less than 15 %. Furthermore, by varying material parameters, energy of conversion can be increased above 1. 0 J/g.

This study analyzes the concept of SBL {{in the area of}} inter-ship and intra-ship movement of materiel as well as ship-to-objective materiel movement in order to gain insight into the envisioned SBL support concept. This study presents a conceptual model blending aspects of current underway replenishment (UNREP) processes with an operational scenario incorporating the tenets of the OMFTS and SBL concepts. A baseline simulation model was developed to estimate UNREP cycle times under various scenarios. Experiments were conducted by modifying the baseline model to assess the impact on inter/intra ship materiel movement cycle time by increasing the lift capacity of the helicopters used for vertical replenishment (VERTREP) as well as increasing the number helicopters used for VERTREP. Results indicate that an increase in helicopter lift capacity significantly reduce overall cycle time, more importantly UNREP cycle time.
