5|$|HBO did {{not make}} a {{decision}} for four months after the <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> delivered. In March 2010, HBO's decision to greenlight the series including the <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> announced, with the production of the series scheduled to start June 2010. HBO however demanded extensive reshoot of the pilot, and wanted all the scenes from Morocco scrapped. A cameo appearance by George RR Martin as a Pentoshi nobleman at Daenerys's wedding filmed in Morocco was therefore also cut. In all 90 percent of the <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> re-shot in 2010, with some cast changes and a different director.|$|E
5|$|The <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> {{filmed in}} 2009 in Oshawa, Ontario, {{and the rest}} of the season was shot from July to November of the {{following}} year in Hamilton and Toronto.|$|E
5|$|When previewed, {{the focus}} group liked the concept but hated the way the <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> produced. Among the {{problems}} with the original <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> the believability of the Eppes family in terms of both physical appearance and chemistry, with the chemistry of the actors being the larger issue. Although Heuton and Falacci liked Cariou, Macht, and Krumholtz, Heuton and Falacci did not know how the three actors playing the Eppes family would interact with each other until filming began.|$|E

The <b>Pilot</b> <b>is</b> also sold in the Philippines.|$|R
50|$|Early on, <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> {{normally}} fabricated of bars {{mounted on}} a frame; later on, sheet metal <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> often used for their additional smoothness, and some cast steel <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> employed for their mass and smooth shape. Early diesel locomotives followed the same plan.|$|R
25|$|SAA {{has responded}} by {{pointing}} out that 85% of its <b>pilots</b> <b>are</b> white, and that 91% of these <b>pilots</b> <b>are</b> male.|$|R
5|$|Following its broadcast, the <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> seen by {{over nine}} million viewers, easily winning its time slot, having nearly doubled viewership from ITV1 {{at the same}} time; the ratings went beyond the producers' expectations. However, critics gave varied {{responses}} towards the episode.|$|E
5|$|In 1915 a Farman {{aeroplane}} crash-landed at Southcote Farm next to Southcote Junction. The <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> able to {{jump from}} the plane before it crashed, and ran alongside it until it collided with a hedge near the railway embankment.|$|E

5000|$|The United States Army Air Forces {{originally}} favoured officer {{pilots and}} the few enlisted <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> usually civilian-qualified. The adoption of transport and strategic bombing missions meant that {{a larger number of}} <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> needed to perform monotonous and gruelling jobs. Officer <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> usually assigned to fly fighters and fighter-bombers and commanded units. Enlisted <b>pilots</b> usually <b>were</b> assigned to fly light reconnaissance and artillery-spotter aircraft, cargo aircraft, and medium- and heavy-weight bombers.|$|R
5|$|In {{cases of}} ditched {{aircraft}}, pilots {{have been able}} to eject safely in several cases. However, fatal aircraft crashes have occurred; in 1994, Lt. Kara Hultgreen, the first female F-14 Tomcat <b>pilot,</b> <b>was</b> killed while attempting to land on board Abraham Lincoln during a training exercise.|$|E
5|$|In the RAF, Marcinkus {{carried out}} {{multiple}} tasks, including various training missions, night combat and bomber escort. In June, Marcinkus and his squadron members engaged in prolonged air combat with the Luftwaffe. As later reports confirm, the Germans lost four Me 109 fighter aircraft, {{one of which}} was shot down by Marcinkus. The original report submitted by Marcinkus claiming one Me 109 shot down on 21 June 1941 is held in The National Archives; he states that he fired two short bursts from his guns from 100 yards behind the German. Sergeant Blasil, also of 1 Squadron, witnessed the plane break up in the air. On the allied side, one American <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> missing. The last mission Marcinkus carried out as a RAF <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> on 12 February 1942.|$|E
5|$|Reception of {{the pilot}} varied {{according}} to the audience in question. The <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> very well received by the mathematics community.

5|$|Season one aired between March 24 and April 26, 2005. It {{originally}} debuted as a midseason {{replacement for}} Committed. It carried over general plot {{ideas from the}} earlier British series created by Stephen Merchant and Ricky Gervais, and particularly the threat of wholesale downsizing. However, only the <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> a direct adaptation {{of one of the}} UK version's episodes.|$|E
5|$|The {{control systems}} {{also had some}} innovations. The control column was {{centrally}} placed and the pilot sat {{on the port side}} of the cockpit. The column had an extension arm fitted and had the ability to be swung over to the starboard side in case the <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> incapacitated. The control instruments were located above the pilot's head in the ceiling, which allowed viewing and did not block the pilot's vision. The fuel instruments were electrical. The He 111 used the inner fuel tanks, closest to the wing root, first. The outer tanks acted as reserve tanks. The <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> alerted to the fuel level when there was 100L (26US gal) left. A manual pump was available in case of electrical or power failure but the delivery rate of just 4½L (1.2US gal) per minute demanded that the pilot fly at the lowest possible speed and just below 3,048m (10,000ft). The He 111 handled well at low speeds.|$|E
5|$|The {{light alloy}} split flaps at the {{trailing}} {{edge of the}} wing were also pneumatically operated via a finger lever on the instrument panel. Only two positions were available; fully up or fully down (85°). The flaps were normally lowered only during the final approach and for landing, and the <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> to retract them before taxiing.|$|E
5000|$|This {{term was}} used {{originally}} in aviation: when a <b>pilot</b> <b>is</b> prevented from flying an aircraft due to misconduct, illness, technical {{problems with the}} aircraft, or other reasons, the <b>pilot</b> <b>is</b> [...] "grounded".|$|R

50|$|Following the 1947 {{creation}} of the United States Air Force, the next appearance of women Air Force <b>pilots</b> <b>was</b> in the 1970s, at which time all Air Force <b>pilots</b> <b>were</b> authorized to wear the same wing badge.|$|R
5|$|The <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> {{delivered}} to Bravo during September 2002, and was well received in audience testing. Soon thereafter NBC purchased Bravo and ordered 12 episodes of the series. NBC promoted the show extensively, including billboard campaigns and print advertisements in national magazines.|$|E

5|$|The American <b>pilot</b> has <b>been</b> heavily bootlegged, but it {{has never}} been {{broadcast}} on TV in any country.

5|$|A full {{series of}} six episodes (five new episodes, plus the <b>pilot)</b> <b>was</b> {{commissioned}} on 31 August 1977. However, Adams {{had in the}} meantime sent {{a copy of the}} Hitchhiker's pilot episode to the BBC's Doctor Who production office, and was commissioned to write a four-part Doctor Who serial ("The Pirate Planet") a few weeks later. In addition, Brett had left the BBC, and the final five episodes in the first series were produced by Geoffrey Perkins.|$|E
5|$|AJ's Infinite Summer is an {{animated}} television pilot created by Toby Jones for Cartoon Network. The pilot follows AJ, whose new job {{during the summer}} drives him crazy with power.

Jones additionally sought inspiration from his hometown of Fargo, North Dakota, and the comics he drew featuring Thompson and his other friends. The <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> released on the official website of Cartoon Network on May 16, 2014.|$|E
