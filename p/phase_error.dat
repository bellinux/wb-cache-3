5|$|A phase-to-amplitude {{converter}} (PAC), {{which uses}} the phase accumulator output word (phase word) usually as an index into a waveform look-up table (LUT) {{to provide a}} corresponding amplitude sample. Sometimes interpolation is used with the look-up table to provide better accuracy and reduce <b>phase</b> <b>error</b> noise. Other methods of converting phase to amplitude, including mathematical algorithms such as power series can be used, particularly in a software NCO.|$|E
5|$|When clocked, {{the phase}} {{accumulator}} (PA) creates a modulo-2N sawtooth waveform {{which is then}} converted by the phase-to-amplitude converter (PAC) to a sampled sinusoid, where N {{is the number of}} bits carried in the phase accumulator. N sets the NCO frequency resolution and is normally much larger than the number of bits defining the memory space of the PAC look-up table. If the PAC capacity is 2M, the PA output word must be truncated to M bits as shown in Figure 1. However, the truncated bits can be used for interpolation. The truncation of the phase output word does not affect the frequency accuracy but produces a time-varying periodic <b>phase</b> <b>error</b> which is a primary source of spurious products. Another spurious product generation mechanism is finite word length effects of the PAC output (amplitude) word.|$|E
25|$|One {{desirable}} {{property of}} all PLLs {{is that the}} reference and feedback clock edges be brought into very close alignment. The average difference in time between the phases of the two signals when the PLL has achieved lock is called the static phase offset (also called the steady-state <b>phase</b> <b>error).</b> The variance between these phases is called tracking jitter. Ideally, the static phase offset should be zero, and the tracking jitter should be as low as possible.|$|E

40|$|The {{estimation}} of <b>phase</b> <b>errors</b> from digital-holography data {{is critical for}} applications such as imaging or wave-front sensing. Conventional techniques require multiple i. i. d. data and perform poorly {{in the presence of}} high noise or large <b>phase</b> <b>errors.</b> In this paper we propose a method to estimate isoplanatic <b>phase</b> <b>errors</b> from a single data realization. We develop a model-based iterative reconstruction algorithm which computes the maximum a posteriori estimate of the phase and the speckle-free object reflectance.

25|$|A {{phase locked}} loop is a {{feedback}} control system. It compares the phases of two input signals and produces an error signal that {{is proportional to the}} difference between their phases. The error signal is then low pass filtered and used to drive a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) which creates an output frequency. The output frequency is fed through a frequency divider back to the input of the system, producing a negative feedback loop. If the output frequency drifts, the <b>phase</b> <b>error</b> signal will increase, driving the frequency in the opposite direction so as to reduce the error. Thus the output is locked to the frequency at the other input. This other input is called the reference and is usually derived from a crystal oscillator, which is very stable in frequency. The block diagram below shows the basic elements and arrangement of a PLL based frequency synthesizer.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the size}} of a horn (expressed in wavelengths) is increased, the <b>phase</b> <b>error</b> increases, giving the horn a wider {{radiation}} pattern.

2500|$|Aperture-limited horn – a long narrow horn, {{long enough}} so the <b>phase</b> <b>error</b> is a {{negligible}} {{fraction of a}} wavelength, so it essentially radiates a plane wave.

2500|$|A bang-bang {{charge pump}} phase {{detector}} must {{always have a}} dead band where the phases of inputs are close enough that the detector detects no <b>phase</b> <b>error.</b> For this reason, bang-bang phase detectors [...] are associated with significant minimum peak-to-peak jitter, because of drift within the dead band. However these types, having outputs consisting of very narrow pulses at lock, are very useful for applications requiring very low VCO spurious outputs. [...] The narrow pulses contain very little energy and are easy to filter out of the VCO control voltage. [...] This results in low VCO control line ripple and therefore low FM sidebands on the VCO.|$|E
2500|$|In the Cassegrain and Gregorian antennas, the {{presence}} of two reflecting surfaces in the signal path offers additional possibilities for improving performance. [...] When the highest performance is required, a technique called [...] "dual reflector shaping" [...] may be used. [...] This involves changing {{the shape of the}} sub-reflector to direct more signal power to outer areas of the dish, to map the known pattern of the feed into a uniform illumination of the primary, to maximize the gain. However, this results in a secondary that is no longer precisely hyperbolic (though it is still very close), so the constant phase property is lost. [...] This <b>phase</b> <b>error,</b> however, can be compensated for by slightly tweaking the shape of the primary mirror. [...] The result is a higher gain, or gain/spillover ratio, at the cost of surfaces that are trickier to fabricate and test. [...] Other dish illumination patterns can also be synthesized, such as patterns with high taper at the dish edge for ultra-low spillover sidelobes, and patterns with a central [...] "hole" [...] to reduce feed shadowing.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) is a widely used instrument for high-resolution imaging from aircraft or satellite platforms. In the paper, {{the problem of the}} defocusing of multi-look SAR images by uncompensated <b>phase</b> <b>errors</b> presented in the received data is analyzed. It is shown that the <b>phase</b> <b>errors</b> on a multi-look processing interval can be effectively described in terms of local quadratic and local linear <b>phase</b> <b>errors.</b> Approximate analytical expressions are derived to describe the azimuth resolution degradation. Criteria for acceptable <b>phase</b> <b>errors</b> are given. The obtained results are verified by numerical simulations.

40|$|Background: The {{accuracy}} of phase-contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance (PC-CMR) can be compromised by background <b>phase</b> <b>errors.</b> It is {{the objective of}} the present work to provide an analysis of the temperature dependence of background <b>phase</b> <b>errors</b> in PC-CMR by means of gradient mount temperature sensing and magnetic field monitoring. Methods: Background <b>phase</b> <b>errors</b> were measured for various temperatures of the gradient mount using magnetic field monitoring and validated in a static phantom. The effect of thermal changes during k-space acquisition was simulated and confirmed with measurements in a stationary phantom. Results: The temperature of the gradient mount was found to increase by 20 – 30 K during PC-CMR measurements of 6 – 12 min duration. Associated changes in background <b>phase</b> <b>errors</b> of up to 11 % or 0. 35 radian were measured at 10 cm from the magnet’s iso-center as a result of first order offsets. Zeroth order <b>phase</b> <b>errors</b> exhibited little thermal dependence. Conclusions: It is concluded that changes in gradient mount temperature significantly modify background <b>phase</b> <b>errors</b> during PC-CMR with high gradient duty cycle. Since temperature increases significantly during the first minutes of scanning the results presented are also of relevance for single-slice or multi-slice PC-CMR scans. The findings prompt for further studies to investigate advanced correction methods taking into account gradient temperature and/or the use of concurrent field-monitoring to map gradient-induced fields throughout the scan...|$|R

However, in wattmeters, energy meters, and power factor meters, phase shift produces errors.
