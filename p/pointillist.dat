25|$|Sunday in the Park with George is {{a musical}} {{with music and}} lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and book by James Lapine. It was {{inspired}} by the French <b>pointillist</b> painter Georges Seurat's painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. The plot revolves around George, a fictionalized version of Seurat, who immerses himself deeply in painting his masterpiece, and his great-grandson (also named George), a conflicted and cynical contemporary artist. The Broadway production opened in 1984.|$|E
25|$|In 1905, Matisse, Metzinger and Delaunay {{experimented with}} the {{technique}} of Divisionism, elaborating on the Neo-Impressionist principles of Georges Seurat, Henri-Edmond Cross and Paul Signac. Rather than using small <b>pointillist</b> patches of pure color, they began to employ larger brushstrokes of mixed color, forming patterns that resembled Byzantine mosaics. Signac and Cross evolved similarly, working {{in close contact with}} Matisse in Saint-Tropez during the summer of 1904. In Collioure the following year, Matisse painted his first fauve works alongside Derain.|$|E
25|$|Chevreul {{was perhaps}} the most {{important}} influence on artists at the time; his great contribution was producing a color wheel of primary and intermediary hues. Chevreul was a French chemist who restored tapestries. During his restorations he noticed {{that the only way to}} restore a section properly was to take into account the influence of the colors around the missing wool; he could not produce the right hue unless he recognized the surrounding dyes. Chevreul discovered that two colors juxtaposed, slightly overlapping or very close together, would have the effect of another color when seen from a distance. The discovery of this phenomenon became the basis for the <b>pointillist</b> technique of the Neoimpressionist painters.|$|E
40|$|A {{new kind}} of {{multi-modal}} image representation that results in computer generated images is introduced. This image representation has been motivated by human visual perception. We call the style of images `Symbolic Pointillism' since it resembles certain impressionist images drawn by the sub [...] group of <b>Pointillists.</b> However, instead of points, symbolic icons represent condensed and meaningful local information...|$|R
50|$|In 1886 van Gogh {{left the}} Netherlands for Paris and the {{guidance}} of his brother Theo van Gogh. While van Gogh had been influenced by great Dutch masters, coming to Paris meant {{that he would have}} the opportunity to be influenced by Impressionists, Symbolists, <b>Pointillists,</b> and Japanese art. His circle of friends included Émile Bernard, Paul Gauguin, Camille Pissarro, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and others.|$|R
50|$|Scumble is a {{technique}} similar to glazing, except that the coating is opaque, and is just painted on very thinly to allow bits of the paint below to shine through. Scumbling works by a principle {{similar to that used}} by <b>pointillists,</b> mixing colors optically. While most painters glaze with dark colors, scumbling is more popularly used for lighter colors; especially atmospheric effects when rendering fog or clouds.|$|R
25|$|Le Chahut is a {{conspicuous}} example of Seurat’s <b>pointillist</b> technique. The modulation {{of light and}} shadow throughout the work is obtained by the use of small dots of color juxtaposed side by side while alternating in both intensity and concentrations. The dots are meant to fuse {{in the eye of the}} viewer to create the impression of mixed colors when observed from a distance. While the Impressionists had focused their attention on the harmony of colors based on similar or related hues (only partially separated), the Neo-Impressionists harmony had been based on contrasting hues, pitted one against the other; resulting in a vibrating mélange optique (the optical mixture in the observer's eye).|$|E
25|$|Le Chahut is an oil {{painting}} on canvas measuring 170 by 141cm (67 x 55 in). Seurat employed a Divisionist style, with <b>pointillist</b> dots of color. The work {{is dominated by}} a color scheme that tends toward the red end of the spectrum, of earth tones that draw from a palette of browns, tans, warm grays, and blues, interspersed with not just the primary colors (reds and yellows), nor even with the six principal colors, but with eighteen mixtures on his palette prior to application on the canvas (any {{of which could be}} mixed with white). A deeper blue border painted {{around the edge of the}} canvas culminates in a shallow arch on the upper edge.|$|E
25|$|The {{museum is}} most {{famous for its}} {{collections}} of Impressionist, Post-Impressionist paintings, widely {{regarded as one of}} the finest collections outside of France. Highlights include more than 30 paintings by Claude Monet, including six of his Haystacks and a number of Water Lilies. Also in the collection are important works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir such as Two Sisters (On the Terrace), and Gustave Caillebotte's Paris Street; Rainy Day. Post-Impressionist works include Paul Cézanne's The Basket of Apples, and Madame Cézanne in a Yellow Chair. At the Moulin Rouge by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec is another highlight. The <b>pointillist</b> masterpiece, which also inspired a musical and was famously featured in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Georges Seurat's Sunday Afternoon on La Grande Jatte—1884, is prominently displayed. Additionally, Henri Matisse's Bathers by a River, is an important example of his work. Highlights of non-French paintings of the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist collection include Vincent van Gogh's Bedroom in Arles and ,1887.|$|E

For her first exhibit in Mexico Diego Rivera wrote, “The use of divided color that she brings about with insight and sensitivity {{is one of}} the qualities in her work that she should strive to retain.” In 1950 Dr Atl noted that “This artist is essentially a luminist, because she paints with light, not in the manner of the <b>Pointillists</b> or the Futurists, but rather according to her own understanding, by creating genuine vibratory sensations in the spectator.” ...|$|R
50|$|In 1886, van Gogh {{left the}} Netherlands for Paris and the {{guidance}} of his brother Theo van Gogh who was an art dealer.

500|$|Many admirers of {{the first}} work donated to MOBA are hypnotized by {{the image of a}} portly man wearing [...] "Y-front" [...] {{underwear}} while sitting on a chamber pot, in <b>pointillist</b> impressionism similar to the style of Georges Seurat. [...] One critic speculates the <b>pointillist</b> style in George may have been acquired [...] "from watching too much TV". The title refers to the Stephen Sondheim musical Sunday in the Park with George, which contains a dramatic recreation of Seurat's painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. Author Amy Levin suggests that George is a pastiche of Seurat's painting. The subject of this painting has been [...] "tentatively identified" [...] by the Annals of Improbable Research—the creators of the Ig Nobel award—as [...] John Ashcroft, former United States Attorney General.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the <b>pointillist</b> impressionism of George, the museum also features a [...] "fine example of labor-intensive pointlessism", according to MOBA staff. Mari Newman's Juggling Dog in Hula Skirt (tempera and acrylic paint on canvas; donated by the artist), inspired this description by MOBA: [...] "We can only wonder what possesses an artist to portray a dog juggling bones while wearing a hula skirt." [...] MOBA enjoys the mystery {{as much as any}} other aspect of art, however.|$|E
500|$|A team of restorers led by conservators Umberto Baldini and Ornella Casazza at the [...] "Laboratario del Restauro" [...] in Florence spent {{ten years}} reapplying paint. They worked {{in an almost}} <b>pointillist</b> manner, {{with the aid of}} {{computer}} modelling. The tiny specks of pigment floating around the piece were recovered with pliers by staff wading in the water after the torrents had subsided. The wooden frame had significantly weakened, and it was necessary to separate it from both the gesso and canvas to prevent buckling as the reapplied paint dried. The restorers succeeded in returning the work close to its original appearance, and it was put back on public display in 1976.|$|E
40|$|The French painter Georges Seurat had {{a lively}} {{interest}} in the sciences. His technique of pointillism 9 ̆ 7 painting with tiny flecks of pure colors 9 ̆ 7 was inspired by theories of light and perception that trace back to James Clerk Maxwell and Hermann von Helmholtz, among others. Unfortunately for Seurat, the scientific underpinnings of pointillism did nothing to soften criticism of his paintings when he exhibited them in the 1880 s, but his ideas have certainly been vindicated since then. A century later we are all <b>pointillists.</b> We tend to see every image {{as a collection of}} little dots...|$|R
50|$|Vegetable Gardens in Montmartre: La Butte Montmartre (F346) {{depicts the}} {{changing}} {{landscape of the}} Montmartre landscape. In the foreground are allotted vegetable gardens with people working in their allotments. Although still somewhat rural, a large apartment building is constructed in the fields. The three remaining windmills in the area had now {{become a source of}} entertainment and respite from working in the city. Le Blute-Fin, also called Le Moulin de la Galette was the largest standing mill offering a café and a terraced viewing platform for looking over Paris from behind the mill. Between the mills are dining establishments and dance halls. He used techniques he picked up from the Impressionists and <b>Pointillists,</b> such as use of short brush strokes or dots of color. The colors are much brighter than the somber colors he used in the Netherlands.|$|R
5000|$|In 1886 van Gogh {{left the}} Netherlands never to return. He moved to Paris {{to live with}} his brother Theo, a Parisian art dealer. Vincent entered Paris as a shy, somber man.

Although van Gogh had been influenced by great masters in the Netherlands, coming to Paris meant that he was exposed to Impressionists, Symbolists, <b>Pointillists,</b> and Japanese art (see Japonism). His circle of friends included Camille Pissarro, Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, Paul Gauguin, Émile Bernard, Paul Signac, and others. The works of the Japanese ukiyo-e artists Hiroshige and Hokusai greatly influenced van Gogh, both for the subject matter and the style of flat patterns of colors without shadow. In the two years from 1886 through 1888 he spent working in Paris, van Gogh explored the various genres, creating his own unique style.|$|R
500|$|A visitor was {{so moved}} by George he felt {{compelled}} to express his gratitude for its display in the Dedham Community Theatre basement, writing [...] "Someone had slipped into the bathroom as I took in this painting and began peeing loudly into a toilet. The reverberating sound of urine splashing while viewing George brought the painting to life, and when the denouement of the flush sounded, I wept." [...] MOBA's accompanying caption introduces questions and observations: [...] "Can the swirling steam melt away the huge weight of George's corporate responsibilities? This <b>pointillist</b> piece is curious for meticulous attention to fine detail, such as the stitching {{around the edge of}} the towel, in contrast to the almost careless disregard for the subject's feet." ...|$|E
500|$|Stereolab {{followed}} up with another EP, Super-Electric, and a single, [...] "Stunning Debut Album" [...] (which was neither debut nor album). The band's early material was rock and guitar-oriented; of Super-Electric, Jason Ankeny wrote in AllMusic that [...] "Droning guitars, skeletal rhythms, and pop hooks—not vintage synths and <b>pointillist</b> melodies—were their calling cards..." [...] In 1992, Stereolab's first full-length album, Peng!, and first compilation, Switched On, were released on independent label Too Pure. Around this time, the lineup consisted of Gane and Sadier plus vocalist Mary Hansen, drummer Andy Ramsay, bassist Duncan Brown, keyboardist Katharine Gifford, and guitarist Sean O'Hagan of the 1980s famed Microdisney duo. Hansen, an Australian, had {{been in touch with}} Gane since his McCarthy days. After joining, she and Sadier developed a style of vocal counterpoint that distinguished Stereolab's sound until Hansen's death ten years later in 2002. O'Hagan would later leave to form The High Llamas, but would frequently return to contribute to Stereolab's records.|$|E
500|$|The {{songs on}} Coexist, which Edna Gundersen of USA Today {{categorized}} as indie pop, eschew melodic structure for minimalist dynamics and sparse sounds. John Calvert of Fact asserts {{that it is}} [...] "a far more meditative album" [...] for deviating from its predecessor's [...] "tight, brisk pop songs", [...] "nuanced [...] interplay", and [...] "light dynamics". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times comments that songs [...] "unfold ... beginning as <b>pointillist</b> sketches and ending up as huge, blurry color blocks." [...] Reflecting the band's electronic dance influences, Coexist features atmospheric, dance-orientated song structures, deemphasises traditional verse-chorus form, and incorporates influences from dubstep and rave music. Drowned in Sound's Hayden Woolley writes that the music features [...] "watercolour textures and rhythms that seem to lock-in to the ebbing pulse and cadences of the body." [...] Rory Gibb of The Quietus believes that Coexist is neither a [...] "pop" [...] nor [...] "downtempo dance record", but occupies [...] "a hazy space between the two" [...] and is an attempt at [...] "post-Burial pop". Simon Price of The Independent asserts that [...] "rather than clubland, Coexist owes a debt to comedown/chillout culture".|$|E
5000|$|... 5. The Dot Paintings (1963-1981): For the {{paintings}} of his fifth and last period, Kirkland used wooden dowels to place dots of oil paint in various sizes and colors over an interactive background of forms of oil paint and water mixtures (or sometimes, instead, a color gradation background, also done in oil). He invented this technique which appears very different than Pointillism or the Ben-Day Dots of artist Roy Lichtenstein. [...] Péter Fitz, Director, Kiscelli Múzeum, Budapest, stated, “A highly unique period ensued, the long series of ‘Dot Paintings’. ...This technique might remind one of Pointillism, but only in theory, not in practice...this method is far {{from that of the}} <b>Pointillists.</b> The big, organic forms are built up from tiny dots, using powerful, sometimes brutal colors... The dots of paint are plastic; they protrude {{from the surface of the}} painting, almost transforming it to a relief.” ...|$|R

500|$|Spiral coils, formed of helicoidally stacked {{cellulose}} microfibrils, create Bragg {{reflection in}} the [...] "marble berries" [...] of the African herb Pollia condensata, resulting in the most intense blue coloration known in nature. The berry's surface has four layers of cells with thick walls, containing spirals of transparent cellulose spaced so as to allow constructive interference with blue light. Below these cells is a layer two or three cells thick containing dark brown tannins. Pollia produces a stronger colour than the wings of Morpho butterflies, {{and is one of}} the first instances of structural coloration known from any plant. Each cell has its own thickness of stacked fibres, making it reflect a different colour from its neighbours, and producing a pixellated or <b>pointillist</b> effect with different blues speckled with brilliant green, purple and red dots. The fibres in any one cell are either left-handed or right-handed, so each cell circularly polarizes the light it reflects in one direction or the other. Pollia is the first organism known to show such random polarization of light, which, nevertheless does not have a visual function, as the seed-eating birds that visit this plant species are not able to perceive polarised light. Spiral microstructures are also found in scarab beetles where they produce iridescent colours.|$|E

2500|$|Cross's {{paintings}} of the early- to mid-1890s are characteristically <b>Pointillist,</b> with closely and regularly positioned tiny dots of color. Beginning around 1895, he gradually shifted his technique, instead using broad, blocky brushstrokes and leaving small areas of exposed bare canvas between the strokes. The resulting surfaces resembled mosaics, and the paintings {{may be seen as}} precursors to Fauvism and Cubism. In the <b>Pointillist</b> style, minute spots of paint were used to blend colors harmoniously; in contrast, the strategy in [...] "second generation Neo-Impressionism" [...] was to keep the colors separate, resulting in [...] "vibrant shimmering visual effects through contrast". Cross stated that the Neo-Impressionists were [...] "far more interested in creating harmonies of pure color, than in harmonizing the colors of a particular landscape or natural scene". Matisse and other artists were very influenced by the late-career Cross, and such works were instrumental in forming the principles of Fauvism. Among the other artists influenced by Cross were André Derain, Henri Manguin, Charles Camoin, Albert Marquet, Jean Puy, and Louis Valtat.|$|E

Surprised that Vincent had come to Paris unannounced, and in opposition to their conversations about timing of his arrival, Vincent stayed in Theo's apartment on Rue Laval until a larger apartment could be acquired. For four months, Van Gogh studied with Fernand Cormon, painting plaster casts, live nude models and props available at Cormon's studio. [...] Cormon also encouraged open-air painting. [...] There me met Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Émile Bernard, and Louis Anquetin. Through Theo and artistic social circles he also met Edgar Degas, Camille Pissarro, Paul Signac, Georges Seurat, and Paul Gauguin. [...] Through the fellowship with these men, he was introduced to Impressionists, Symbolists, <b>Pointillists,</b> and Japanese art, Ukiyo-e, and woodcut prints. In spite of his unusual manner, disheveled clothes and often time frightening manner, Paris was the one place where Van Gogh developed friendships with other artists. [...] So much so that when Toulouse-Lautrec heard disparaging remarks against Van Gogh, he challenged the man to a duel. Seeing and trading artwork with the Parisian avant-garde artists, Van Gogh understood what Theo {{had been trying to}} tell him for years about modern art.

The most noted of these is “Sunship for John Coltrane” (1990), on loan to and displayed by the Ogden Museum of Southern Art. In the 1990s, he began painting layers over tape, then removing the tape to create patterns, shapes and lines of melodic color as a form of improvisation [...] While the paintings are abstract and not representational, they use Shaw’s scientific view that the world is made up of energized particles in constant flux. Through light’s energy source comes color, making colors themselves energy sources that can communicate emotions, moods and perhaps transcendental meaning to the viewer. The grids on a 45 degree angle from this period are not rigid. Instead they are created as lines of dots of color modulations and variations, much like the French <b>Pointillists.</b> The counterpoint of the colors, lines and shapes makes them blend and flow into each other, creating different and echoing sub-patterns within the painting which are “continuously forcing the eye into a scanning motion.” [...] The grid design is further broken up by paint strokes splashed across the painting, which Shaw uses as a Dionysian element of disorder across the Apollonian logic behind the grids[...]In the 1980s, Shaw began a series of paintings on events in the Torah of the Old Testament utilizing all the elements he had incorporated into his work. He continued on this series of 30 paintings until 2011, when 21 of his sur-abstract paintings were exhibited at St. Peter’s Lutheran Church in New York City.|$|R

It depicts immobile figures outdoors under artificial lighting at the sideshow of the Circus Corvi at place de la Nation, a working-class quarter in eastern Paris. A row of cornet and trombone players in solemn formation are seen under the unreal evening lights of a parade. The work is dominated by a monotony of horizontal and vertical lines, suggesting the rhythms of Egyptian reliefs and frescoes. Though rather than indicating distance as Egyptian art (by changing scale), or classically (by foreshortening), Seurat establishes the position of his subjects through lighting. Those in the foreground are unlit, painted in dark blue, while those behind the gas jets are brilliantly lit.|$|E
