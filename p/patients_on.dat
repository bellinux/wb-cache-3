40|$|M. Cur. Nursing {{practitioners}} {{working in}} the critical care unit are responsible for quality nursing care of the <b>patient</b> <b>on</b> pressure-controlled ventilation. Pressure-controlled ventilation is a high-risk interaction, with potential life-threatening complications, for example barotrauma. There are, however, in the South-African context no standards for pressure-controlled ventilation with which quality nursing of the <b>patient</b> <b>on</b> pressure-controlled ventilation can be evaluated. The following question is then asked in this study: Which standards should be formulated for the adult <b>patient</b> <b>on</b> pressure-controlled ventilation incritical care units? The goal {{of this study is}} then to formulate standards for the adult <b>patient</b> <b>on</b> pressure-controlled ventilation in critical care units. An explorative, descriptive and modified standard-generating research design is followed in this study. The research methodology as suggested by Muller (1998 a: 606 - 609; 1998 b: 636 - 637) for standard development during the quality improvement process is used in this study. Standard formulation consists out of three phases, namely a development phase, a quantifying-/ validation phase and a testing phase. During the development phase of this study, a literature study is conducted after which concept standards for the adult <b>patient</b> <b>on</b> pressure-controlled ventilation in critical care units are formulated. During the validation phase of this study, the concept standards are validated by means of a consensus debate session with clinical domain experts. Seventeen standards in total were formulated. Standard one to fifteen are structure standards. These standards address the ethico-legal, philosophical and management framework according to which the nurse practitioner functions during the nursing of the adult <b>patient</b> <b>on</b> pressure controlled ventilation in critical care units. It also includes the fascilitating context, as well as facilities, equipment, stock and medication, procedures and protocols and aspect of personnel development necessary to nurse the <b>patient</b> <b>on</b> pressure-controlled ventilation. Lastly in this group of standards the knowledge and skills which the critical care nurse requires for nursing the <b>patient</b> <b>on</b> pressurecontrolled ventilation are described. Standard sixteen is the process standard for nursing the <b>patient</b> <b>on</b> pressure-controlled ventilation. This standard is described as one comprehensive standard to facilitate easy use in practice and to address the nursing process holistically. Standard seventeen can be described as the outcome standard for the nursing of the adult <b>patient</b> <b>on</b> pressure-controlled ventilation and describes the expected aspects of quality improvement...|$|R
5|$|Preterm newborns {{are known}} to be at higher risk for bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} with extended exposure to high concentrations of oxygen. Other groups at higher risk for oxygen toxicity are <b>patients</b> <b>on</b> mechanical ventilation with exposure to levels of oxygen greater than 50%, and patients exposed to chemicals that increase risk for oxygen toxicity such the chemotherapeutic agent bleomycin. Therefore, current guidelines for <b>patients</b> <b>on</b> mechanical ventilation in intensive care recommends keeping oxygen concentration less than 60%. Likewise, divers who undergo treatment of decompression sickness are at increased risk of oxygen toxicity as treatment entails exposure to long periods of oxygen breathing under hyperbaric conditions, in addition to any oxygen exposure during the dive.|$|E
5|$|Caesium {{compounds}} {{are rarely}} encountered by most people, but most caesium compounds are mildly toxic. Like rubidium, caesium tends to substitute potassium in the body, but is significantly larger {{and is therefore}} a poorer substitute. Excess caesium can lead to hypokalemia, arrythmia, and acute cardiac arrest, but such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources. As such, caesium {{is not a major}} chemical environmental pollutant. The median lethal dose (LD50) value for caesium chloride in mice is 2.3g per kilogram, which is comparable to the LD50 values of potassium chloride and sodium chloride. Caesium chloride has been promoted as an alternative cancer therapy, but has been linked to the deaths of over 50 <b>patients,</b> <b>on</b> whom it was used as part of a scientifically unvalidated cancer treatment.|$|E

Amongst the cargo carried by was often live animals, including horses, cattle and sheep. During one of her trips, Kommandøren ran aground on 20 October 1900 near Tjugum in Balestrand. The ship was also at times employed to transport important dignitaries in the region, like she did in September 1920, when she brought politicians to Vik to inspect the area for a proposed railway project. Shortly after delivery, in September 1892, Kommandøren provided transport support to a large-scale Norwegian Army field exercise in Western Norway. She was tasked with transporting troops from Gudvangen to Lærdalsøyri {{after the completion of}} the exercises.|$|E

5|$|Paradoxical reactions, such as {{increased}} seizures in epileptics, aggression, violence, impulsivity, irritability and suicidal behavior sometimes occur. These reactions have been explained as consequences of disinhibition {{and the subsequent}} loss of control over socially unacceptable behavior. Paradoxical reactions are rare in the general population, with an incidence rate below 1% and similar to placebo. However, they occur with greater frequency in recreational abusers, individuals with borderline personality disorder, children, and <b>patients</b> <b>on</b> high-dosage regimes. In these groups, impulse control problems {{are perhaps the most}} important risk factor for disinhibition; learning disabilities and neurological disorders are also significant risks. Most reports of disinhibition involve high doses of high-potency benzodiazepines. Paradoxical effects may also appear after chronic use of benzodiazepines.|$|E
5|$|Pharmacists {{involved}} in CPAs may participate in clinical {{services that are}} outside of the traditional scope of practice for pharmacists. Notably, pharmacists {{do not need to}} participate in CPAs to provide many pharmacy practice services that are already covered by their traditional scope of practice, such as performing medication therapy management, providing disease prevention services (e.g. immunizations), engaging in public health screenings (e.g. screening patients for depressive disorders, such as major depressive disorder, via administering the PHQ-2), providing disease-state specific education (e.g. as a certified diabetes educator), and counseling <b>patients</b> <b>on</b> information regarding their medications.|$|E
5|$|Registered Nurses: Registered {{nurses are}} {{responsible}} for coordinating {{all aspects of the}} patient's care and insuring symptoms (physical or otherwise) are being addressed and managed. The primary care nurse visits a minimum of twice weekly, and the content of the visit can vary greatly. When patients are experiencing few symptoms and/or are early in their diseases, the RN visit may just be a short check up. If a patient's symptoms worsen, the nurse will visit more often, make recommendations for increasing or changing the medication intervention and provide support and education regarding the disease/dying process. Many <b>patients</b> <b>on</b> hospice may require complex treatments: respiratory care, wound care or even IV therapy at home. In most cases, the hospice nurse is trained to handle these unique needs as well.|$|E
