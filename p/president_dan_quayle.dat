25|$|President George H. W. Bush and Vice <b>President</b> <b>Dan</b> <b>Quayle</b> easily won renomination by the Republican Party. However, {{the success}} of the {{conservative}} opposition forced the moderate Bush to move further to the right than in the previous election, and to incorporate many socially conservative planks in the party platform. Bush allowed Buchanan to give the keynote address at the Republican National Convention in Houston, Texas, and his culture war speech alienated many moderates.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, Bernard Goldberg {{published}} a book with the title , alleging a liberal bias in print and broadcast news organizations. In the book, Goldberg used Dan Rather as a primary example of a news anchor with a liberal bias. He also criticized the anchor for his criticisms of President George W.

25|$|In November 1991, {{a series}} of strips {{appeared}} to give credibility to a real-life prison inmate who falsely stated that former Vice <b>President</b> <b>Dan</b> <b>Quayle</b> had connections with drug dealers. The strip sequence was dropped by some two dozen newspapers, {{in part because the}} allegations had been investigated and dispelled previously. Six years later, the reporter who broke the Quayle story, some weeks after the Doonesbury cartoons, later published a book saying he no longer believed the story had been true.|$|E
25|$|Powell's {{experience}} in military matters {{made him a}} very popular figure with both American political parties. Many Democrats admired his moderate stance on military matters, while many Republicans saw him as a great asset associated with the successes of past Republican administrations. Put forth as a potential Democratic Vice Presidential nominee in the 1992 U.S. presidential election or even potentially replacing Vice <b>President</b> <b>Dan</b> <b>Quayle</b> as the Republican Vice Presidential nominee, Powell eventually declared himself a Republican and began to campaign for Republican candidates in 1995. He was touted as a possible opponent of Bill Clinton in the 1996 U.S. presidential election, possibly capitalizing on a split conservative vote in Iowa and even leading New Hampshire polls for the GOP nomination, but Powell declined, citing a lack of passion for politics. Powell defeated Clinton 50–38 in a hypothetical match-up proposed to voters in the exit polls conducted on Election Day. Despite not standing in the race, Powell won the Republican New Hampshire Vice-Presidential primary on write-in votes.|$|E

5000|$|Historical fiction, Mallon {{declares}} in interviews, is {{the genre}} {{in which he}} is most interested as a writer. “I think the main thing that has led me to write historical fiction {{is that it is a}} relief from the self,” he explains. [...] After the publication of Henry and Clara, Mallon went on to write five more works of historical fiction, including his most recent novel and his fifteenth book, Watergate. American political history has been perhaps his main subject and interest; in 1994, he was the ghostwriter of former Vice <b>President</b> <b>Dan</b> <b>Quayle’s</b> memoir, Standing Firm.|$|R

500|$|... four-part series, {{based in}} part on {{interviews}} with former administration officials. The articles characterized Cheney not as a [...] "shadow" [...] president, but as someone who usually has the last words of counsel to the president on policies, which in many cases would reshape the powers of the presidency. When former Vice <b>President</b> <b>Dan</b> <b>Quayle</b> suggested to Cheney that the office was largely ceremonial, Cheney reportedly replied, [...] "I have a different understanding with the president." [...] The articles described Cheney as having a secretive approach to the tools of government, indicated by the use of his own security classification and three man-sized safes in his offices.|$|E
500|$|Former Pat Buchanan pollster Frank Luntz {{was hired}} by the campaign, along with former Republican National Campaign Committee {{chairman}} Charles Leonard. The New York Times reported that Perot sought the help of operatives to search court and federal documents to find information that might reflect poorly on the potential candidate so that preparations could be made to respond. In the final round of Democratic and Republican primaries, most notably in California, exit polls revealed that 42% of Republicans and 33% of Democrats favored Perot. A Time Magazine poll found that Perot had 37% support of all the electorate, ahead of both Bush and Clinton who tied for second at 24%. At this time, Vice <b>President</b> <b>Dan</b> <b>Quayle</b> became the most senior member of the Bush administration to criticize Perot, calling him a [...] "temperamental tycoon".|$|E

50|$|The 1976 United States House of Representatives {{elections}} was {{an election}} for the United States House of Representatives in 1976 which coincided with Jimmy Carter's election as President. Carter's narrow victory over Gerald Ford had limited coattails, and his Democratic Party gained a net {{of only one}} seat from the Republican Party in the House. This election is notable for being the last time any party had a veto-proof majority in the House. Notable Freshmen included future Vice <b>Presidents</b> <b>Dan</b> <b>Quayle</b> and Al Gore, future Senators Daniel Akaka, Barbara Mikulski, Ed Markey, and Paul S.

500|$|Pat Buchanan, the {{conservative}} columnist who challenged President Bush in the 1992 presidential primaries, came to Ohio {{to campaign for}} McEwen, as did Vice <b>President</b> <b>Dan</b> <b>Quayle</b> and Oliver North. Though George H. W. Bush won the district, McEwen was narrowly defeated by Strickland {{in the general election}} on November 3. While he won 55-45 in the area he once represented, McEwen did not win in any of the counties that had once been in Miller's district, losing the unfamiliar territory 59-41. Strickland received 122,720 votes to McEwen's 119,252, a plurality of only 3,468. [...] "I think McEwen's loss was a case of bounced checks and some arrogance," [...] said Alfred Tuchfarber, {{a political science professor at}} the University of Cincinnati who runs the Ohio Poll. [...] "He just had a certain personal arrogance about him that didn't go down well in a poor district." [...] Strickland said, [...] "I ran against Pat Robertson, Pat Buchanan, the National Rifle Association and Right-to-Life. They threw everything at me. I'm just so happy I beat back those guys. I think they're so divisive." ...|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} month, {{controversy}} against the band grew. Vice <b>President</b> <b>Dan</b> <b>Quayle</b> branded [...] "Cop Killer" [...] as being [...] "obscene," [...] and President George H.W. Bush publicly denounced any record company that would release such a product. Body Count {{was removed from}} the shelves of a retail store in Greensboro, North Carolina after local police had told the management that they would no longer respond to any emergency calls at the store if they continued to sell the album. In July 1992, the New Zealand Police Commissioner unsuccessfully attempted to prevent an Ice-T concert in Auckland, arguing that [...] "Anyone who comes to this country preaching in obscene terms the killing of police, should not be welcome here," [...] before taking Body Count and Warner Bros. Records to the Indecent Publications Tribunal, {{in an effort to get}} it banned under New Zealand's Indecent Publications Act. This was the first time in 20 years that a sound recording had come before the censorship body, and the first ever case involving popular music. After reviewing the various submissions, and listening carefully to the album, the Tribunal found the song [...] "Cop Killer" [...] to be [...] "not exhortatory," [...] saw the album as displaying [...] "an honest purpose," [...] and found Body Count not indecent.|$|E

Homer, the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant's Y2K {{compliance}} officer, declares that he fixed {{all the possible}} Y2K problems at the plant, including the computers. Unfortunately, Homer forgot to fix his own computer, {{and in the process}} sends a virus across the world. Chaos ensues, and widespread looting begins. Krusty's malfunctioning pacemaker apparently kills him in front of the family. Bart tearfully mourns his hero, but he perks up, after finding a note. The letter in Krusty's pocket states that a rocket (codenamed Exodus) is being populated with humanity's [...] "best and brightest", and will be launched in order to preserve human civilization on Mars. When they reach the shuttle, Homer fails to bluff his way on board by claiming to be the famous pianist from the film Shine but the armed guard recognizes Lisa as the ship's designated proofreader. Lisa is only able to take one parent with her, and quickly chooses Marge. Homer and Bart find a second, unguarded rocket and board just before it launches. They quickly notice that the spaceliner is filled with such notoriously obnoxious and mediocre celebrities as radio psychologist Dr. Laura, film director Spike Lee, skating champion Tonya Harding, former vice <b>president</b> <b>Dan</b> <b>Quayle,</b> grunge rock singer Courtney Love, politician Ross Perot, civil rights activist Al Sharpton, actor Tom Arnold, MTV VJ Pauly Shore, and actress/talk show host Rosie O'Donnell. Although the craft is headed directly for the sun, Homer and Bart eject themselves from the spacecraft and die of explosive decompression, to their relief.|$|E

500|$|Perot {{participated in}} the first of three presidential debates for the 1992 election, on October 11 in Clayton, Missouri, along with George Bush and Bill Clinton. It {{was the first time that}} a third party {{candidate}} was involved in a national televised debate since John B. Anderson in 1980, and was the first presidential debate to ever feature three candidates. During the event, Perot discussed a wide range of issues including the budget deficit, education and drug use, and proclaimed that as president, he would eliminate the influence of lobbyists. He also had a few memorable quips. When asked to address detractors' criticism of his lack of government experience, he remarked: [...] "Well, they've got a point. I don't have any experience running up a $4 trillion debt." [...] When discussing what would happen if one of his opponents won, he commented: [...] "then they will have heard the harsh reality of what we have to do. I'm not playing Lawrence Welk music here tonight." [...] After the debate, three out of four polls declared Perot as the winner. The average of all four showed Perot at 37% followed by Clinton with 30% and Bush with 18%, but election polls still showed Perot in third with 14%, far behind both Bush and Clinton. His running mate, James Stockdale, participated in a Vice Presidential debate in Atlanta, with fellow Vice Presidential nominee Al Gore and Vice <b>President</b> <b>Dan</b> <b>Quayle.</b> Largely unknown to the general public, Stockdale memorably opened the debate by unexpectedly asking the philosophical question, [...] "Who am I? Why am I here?" [...] He was unprepared to deal with some of the substantive issues raised, and his struggling performance may have damaged the Perot campaign.|$|E
