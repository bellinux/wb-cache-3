Moreover, the recent literature emphasizes the role SMEs play in nurturing entrepreneurship and generating new products and processes. Although SMEs could be a source <b>of</b> <b>new</b> ideas and innovations, there are substantial productivity differences between small and large establishments. In this paper, we analyze three sources of productivity differentials: technical change, returns to scale, and technical change.

40|$|Recent {{empirical}} studies in regional science and urban economics show that agglomeration economies {{may be one}} source of the uneven distribution of economic activities and economic growth across cities and regions. At the same time, {{the body of research}} into the importance of agglomeration economies for the performance of firms is still growing. Such development is necessary, as the theories that underlie agglomeration economies are microeconomic in nature, but still insufficiently understood. In this study, we focus on the determinants <b>of</b> survival among <b>new</b> <b>establishments</b> in the advanced producer services sector in the Netherlands. Employing a mixed hierarchical and cross-classified probit regression, we introduce a model of establishment survival that is specific to characteristics of the internal and external environment of the establishment. Controlling for firm and sector characteristics, we conclude that location accounts for about 4 % {{of the variance in the}} probability <b>of</b> survival <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>establishments.</b> We also find that localization and urbanization economies have a positive effect on the survival <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>establishments.</b> However, <b>new</b> <b>establishments</b> with large start-up sizes appear to profit more from agglomeration economies than <b>new</b> <b>establishments</b> with small start-up sizes. multi-level analysis;micro-macro link;agglomeration economies;new establishments...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to assess the effects of several {{territorial}} characteristics, specifically agglomeration economies, on industrial location processes in the Spanish region of Catalonia. Theoretically, the level of agglomeration causes economies which favour the location <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>establishments,</b> but an excessive level of agglomeration might cause diseconomies, since congestion effects arise. The empirical evidence on this matter is inconclusive, probably because the models used so far are not suitable enough. We use a more flexible semiparametric specification, which allows us to study the nonlinear relationship between the different types of agglomeration levels and location processes. Our main statistical source is the REIC (Catalan Manufacturing Establishments Register), which has plant-level microdata on location <b>of</b> <b>new</b> industrial <b>establishments.</b> Keywords: agglomeration economies, industrial location, Generalized Additive Models, nonparametric estimation, count data models.

Using these data, we find that while <b>new</b> <b>establishments</b> in general account for one third of the gross job creation in the economy, entrepreneurial establishments are responsible for around 25 % of this, and thus only account for about 8 % of total gross job creation in the economy.

Nails were expensive and difficult to obtain in the American colonies, so that abandoned houses were sometimes deliberately burned down to allow recovery of used nails from the ashes. Families often had small nail-manufacturing setups in their homes; during bad weather and at night, the entire family might work at making nails for their own use and for barter. Thomas Jefferson wrote in a letter: [...] "In our private pursuits it is a great advantage that every honest employment is deemed honorable. I am myself a nail maker."

Using data from the Catalan Industrial Establishments Register covering 946 municipalities over the period 2001 - 2004 we find that institutional characteristics, such as e. g. being capital of the province, strongly affect the location decisions of industrial establishments. In contrast, measures of agglomeration and location economies are not that important. We also find a close statistical relation between new locations and relocations. We discuss several econometric strategies based upon Poisson models for cross-section and panel data, thus providing alternative sets of estimates to address the robustness of our conclusions. ...|$|R
