50|$|The New Zealand {{government}} decided in 1987 to restore Akarana {{and give her}} to Australia as the county's gift to celebrate the Australian Bicentennial in 1988. The government purchased her from her existing owner, Andrew Bishop. Instead of the <b>planned</b> <b>start</b> <b>date</b> of 14 May 1987, delays meant she did not arrive back to New Zealand until 24 July 1987.

5|$|In July 1978, Lucas {{revealed}} that Radioland Murders {{was still in}} development, and that both Steve Martin and Cindy Williams were approached for the two leads. The script was being rewritten and the <b>planned</b> <b>start</b> <b>date</b> was early 1979. However, throughout the 1970s to early 1990s, Radioland Murders remained in development hell. Between this time, Lucas commissioned Theodore J. Flicker to perform a rewrite. In early 1993 Lucas told Universal that advances in computer-generated imagery from Industrial Light & Magic (owned by Lucasfilm), particularly in digital mattes, would help bring Radioland Murders in for a relatively low budget of about $10 million, which eventually rose to $15 million.|$|R
50|$|In November it was {{announced}} that plans for the competition were paralysed by legal disputes between PBS and Grace Borg. Despite this the Maltese Head of Delegation, Joe Dimech, has denied that the whole national selection process was in danger, and that PBS were consulting legal advice. New dates for the national selection were to be made after missing their <b>planned</b> <b>start</b> <b>date</b> of 9 November for the first stage of the contest. On 18 November a Maltese court ruled in favour of PBS, in that they could prohibit foreign composers from competing in the GO Malta EuroSong 2010, finally allowing the Maltese selection process to continue.|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} <b>planned</b> <b>start</b> <b>date</b> of 15 April {{was pushed}} {{back when the}} Italians had problems moving to their start positions and later had trouble providing transport to establish lines of communication across the Adriatic. The operation was rescheduled to 25 April. Prior to the Ljubljana conference, the Ustaše authorities were concerned about negotiations between the German and Italian commanders and Dangić, and were particularly worried that the Germans would permit the Italians and Chetniks to use Sarajevo as a base. On 31 March {{the commander of the}} Ustaše Black Legion, Jure Francetić, launched a pre-emptive offensive primarily against Dangić's Chetniks. Francetić captured Vlasenica, Bratunac and Srebrenica, meeting limited resistance from the Partisans, and then scattered the more numerous Chetniks while inflicting significant losses.|$|R
5000|$|Preparations for the 2009 {{registration}} {{began as}} early as April 2008 [...] where the commissioner of Comelec {{took charge of the}} overseas absentee voting process. Comelec held consultations with non-governmental organizations, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and the Commission on Filipinos Overseas (CFO) to ensure that voter turnout in the 2004 elections would not be repeated. A massive information dissemination campaign was also proposed to help out in the information drive. The registration period was postponed to start on February 1, 2009 [...] instead of the originally <b>planned</b> <b>start</b> <b>date</b> of December 1, 2008, this was done to ensure that the embassies and consulates have enough time to prepare.

40|$|Critical Path Method (CPM) {{scheduling}} {{is currently}} the dominant scheduling system in use in construction. Location Based Management System (LBMS) is increasingly being used as an alternative in the US, particularly in hospital construction. The goal {{of this paper is}} to provide a critical evaluation of one such LBMS implementation by comparing it to a CPM implementation run in parallel. Three hypotheses drove this research. First, LBMS requires more person-hours than CPM to manage the schedule. Second, LBMS provides real-time information to make educated decisions about production control. Third, the subcontractors' <b>start</b> <b>dates</b> are controlled better than their production rates. Both systems are currently being used on a 1 million GSF OSHPD hospital in Northern California. Standard task lists were used to compare the different scheduling time requirements. CPM and LBMS reports were then compared to analyze the different deliverables. Finally, LBMS production data was reviewed against CPM actuals and <b>planned</b> <b>start</b> <b>dates</b> to evaluate the most effective method of subcontractor scope management. The results indicate that more time is required to update the CPM compared to the LBMS schedule on the standard task list. However, CPM supports many legacy processes such as change management. Production rates were controlled better than <b>start</b> <b>dates</b> in this project, contrary to our hypothesis. Peer reviewe...|$|R

In 1998, an extension was added to the pathway that took it onto Cleaves Street, School Street and into the Royal River Park, where it intersects with a recreational path. A pedestrian bridge carries it over the Royal River en route to Forest Falls Drive. In 2006, a third phase added a section that took it up to the Hannaford plaza and, after an almost 500-yard gap, a ramp connecting Route 1 up the hill to East Main Street. Talk of bridging this gap, part of which goes beneath the East Main Street bridge, began in 2011, with a <b>planned</b> <b>start</b> <b>date</b> of 2013.

5|$|Magnavox {{designed}} {{the exterior of}} the machine, and re-engineered some the internals with some consultation from Baer and Harrison; they removed the ability to display color, used only the three dial controller, and changed the system of selecting games from a dial to separate game cards that modified the console's circuitry when plugged into the console. At the time, color televisions were still seen as a luxury item, and the ability to show color would have added additional expense and time spent dealing with FCC testing and regulations. The internal circuitry had been designed with discrete components rather than integrated circuits due to cost concerns; these concerns were no longer valid by 1971, but Magnavox did not have enough time to redesign every internal component of the machine prior to the <b>planned</b> production <b>start</b> <b>date.</b> Magnavox named the console first as the Skill-O-Vision while testing, and then released it as the Odyssey. The rifle game was turned into a separately sold add-on game, Shooting Gallery, and Magnavox added paper money, playing cards, and poker chips to the console, {{to go along with the}} plastic overlays for the games that enhanced the primitive visuals. The new additions helped raise the price of the console to US$99.99. Baer was upset with the board game additions, which he felt were pointless add-ons that would go unused by players. Magnavox announced the system's launch date of September 1972, and demonstrated it for months prior to Magnavox dealerships and media.|$|R

40|$|Bosch Rexroth Mellansel is a {{manufacturer}} of hydraulic drivesystems for industrial applications. One part of this solution is the hydraulicmotors known as the Hägglunds-engine. Five engine families are manufactured indifferent sizes and for different applications. The purpose of this project wasto investigate four questions regarding three connected steps in themanufacturing of these engines. These steps were washing, assembling andtesting. The desired outcome {{of the project was}} to determine the weakest linksin the production steps, increase the understanding of the process and a coupleof improvement suggestion to increase efficiency of the process. The fourquestions were:· What problems and challenges does each part ofthe process have?· Which are the bottlenecks in the process?· What is the reason for any variations in theproduct flow?· What is the capacity for the product flow?Additionally any suggestions for improvements of the productflow were to be investigated. The following paragraphs describe the results derived duringthe project. What problems and challenges doeseach part of the process have?The most common and most serious problem for the washingstep was the internal delivery delay from manufacturing which daily causedinability to follow the planned production schedule. The study that was madeshowed that 75 % of the identified disturbances in the washing step were causedby internal delivery delay. The most common disturbance in the assembly line was issueswith quality which accounted for 50 % of the discovered disturbances. Examplesof the incidents were insufficient quality of bought components, re-assemblingof motors because of leakage and insufficient marking of components. In the testing step the identified issues were machinefaults, problems downstream and other errors. These faults each accounted foraround 30 % of the incidents. The most severe of these were the issues with thetesting equipment and especially the test bench of the CBM-motors. Problemsdownstream were caused by issues in the painting workshop and during periodsthis caused a massive build up of tested motors at the testing site. The othererrors category was almost exclusively CBM-motors missing paint covering capsand therefore couldn’t be painted. The overall biggest problem was the internal delivery delayswhich accounted for 61 % of the serious problems encountered. Which are the bottlenecks inthe process? Discrete eventsimulation with the program Simio was utilized to investigate this question. Two different cases of production were investigated, quarter 4 2014 and quarter 4 2011. The result can be seen in Tabell 1. What isthe reason for any variations in the product flow?Primarily it was investigated if variation in workload couldbe found in the flow. This was done by doing a day to day comparison of theworkload during quarter 4 2014 and calculate the standard deviation for theperiod. A standard deviation of 15 percentage point was found which indicatedthat issues with variations in workload existed. To investigate if the reason was the internal deliverydelays a comparison was made between the standard deviation of workload in twocases. The first was calculated by using the <b>planned</b> <b>start</b> <b>date</b> of productionand the second by using the actual <b>start</b> <b>date</b> of production. The result showedan increase of the standard deviation by 16. 3 % when using the actual startdates. This showed that the reason of the variation in workload was at leastpartially because failure to follow schedule. What is the capacity of the product flow?The capacity of the workflow was measured by using theearlier made model in Simio. The product mix of quarter 4 2014 was utilized andthe production rate was ramped up until the model no longer could keep up. Theaverage capacity of the production line can be seen in Tabell 2.
