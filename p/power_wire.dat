In the city of Zenith, in the barbarous twentieth century, a family's motor indicated its social rank as precisely as the grades of the peerage determined the rank of an English family--indeed, more precisely, considering the opinion of old county families upon newly created brewery barons and woolen-mill viscounts. The details of precedence were never officially determined. There was no court to decide whether the second son of a Pierce Arrow limousine should go in to dinner before the first son of a Buick roadster, but of their respective social importance there was no doubt; and where Babbitt as a boy had aspired to the presidency, his son Ted aspired to a Packard twin-six and an established position in the motored gentry.|$|E

50|$|Power line {{communication}} systems operate by impressing a modulated carrier signal on power wires. Different types of powerline communications use different frequency bands, {{depending on the}} signal transmission characteristics of the power wiring used. Since the power wiring system was originally intended for transmission of AC power, the <b>power</b> <b>wire</b> circuits have only a limited ability to carry higher frequencies.

50|$|The {{most common}} {{interface}} uses the {{power supply wiring}} to the device. The circuit is a small surface mounted capacitor between an AC mains wire or a DC <b>power</b> <b>wire</b> and a single digital pin of a small microcontroller that switches a high-power transistor briefly on, then off. The pulses are normally generated by having software toggle a digital I/O pin on the microcontroller.

Only aircraft cables have WSC (wire strand core). Also, aircraft cables are available in smaller diameters than wire rope. For example, aircraft cables are available in 3/64 in. diameter while most wire ropes begin at a 1/4 in. diameter. Static wire ropes are used to support structures such as suspension bridges or as guy wires to support towers. An aerial tramway relies on wire rope to support and move cargo overhead.|$|E

5000|$|Released in December 2010, the Traxxas Spartan {{is a new}} {{single drive}} Radio-controlled boat. The Spartan {{represents}} Traxxas' first all-new boat design in several years. Like the Villain series, it is a sport/power boat configuration with a long, sleek [...] "deep V" [...] style hull. Unlike the Villain series, the Spartan is significantly longer (by 9.8 inches) and has a slightly wider beam (by 1.25 inches), which combine to give the Spartan a much sleeker overall profile. The Spartan also has an abundance of modern features which set it apart from earlier Traxxas boats. The most noticeable is Traxxas' new marine version of its Castle Powered Velineon brushless system, consisting of the new VXL-6s brushless ESC, and Velineon 540XL (1410 castle motor)brushless motor. Both the ESC and the motor are water-cooled, with the motor featuring a unique sealed composite water jacket that allows cooling water to directly contact the motor case, rather than the simple coiled metal tubing water jackets used on other Traxxas boats. The drive system is also {{a departure from the}} steerable outdrive system (the prop and rudder are one unit and are steered together) traditionally used on Traxxas boats. Instead, power on the Spartan is routed via direct drive (no reduction gears) to a single fixed surface piercing prop and steering is controlled by an aluminum rudder operated by a high torque waterproof servo. The Spartan is also uses Traxxas' 2.4GHz radio system (a first on Traxxas boats) with a 5-channel receiver located inside a watertight box. Other notable features include stainless steel trim tabs and turn fins (which help improve stability and turning performance), Traxxas high current battery connectors, 12 gauge <b>power</b> <b>wire,</b> and stainless steel hex hardware. The claimed top speed is 30 mi/h kn with the included dual 8.4 volt NiMH batteries. However, the top speed rises to 50 mi/h kn with optional double 3S LiPo battery packs, which Traxxas claims as the fastest top speed for any RTR (ready to race) radio controlled boat.|$|E

30|$|Multiple cranial and/or femoral access {{approaches}} {{have been reported}} in the literature to treat chronic complex central venous occlusions (Massmann et al., 2016). We chose combined femoral and transhepatic approach due to simultaneous presence of SVC obstruction. Transhepatically placed snare not only helped us to direct the trajectory of RF wire but also to ensnare tip of the RF wire. As the wire crossed the intrahepatic IVC obstruction, we snared the tip of the wire and then advanced the IMA catheter containing goose neck snare into the right atrium. This maneuver allowed the safe and predictable passage of snared <b>Power</b> <b>wire</b> from intrahepatic IVC to right atrium, in the vicinity of beating heart. Thus with the use of appropriate techniques; <b>Power</b> <b>wire</b> recanalization of long occlusive segment of IVC has shown to be safe and effective.|$|E
