30|$|We hope these findings, {{the list}} and {{description}} of WePISMs, and the new vocabulary introduced in this paper to discuss educational innovations, will help developers think more explicitly about the type of change they wish to create and a <b>propagation</b> <b>plan</b> to support their goals.|$|E
30|$|The {{authors found}} {{that in order to}} {{appropriately}} evaluate the <b>propagation</b> <b>plan</b> in each proposal, the nature of the innovation had to be identified. Therefore, the authors found that it was necessary to identify the product type and features of the innovation. To create the product type and feature sections of the DSAAI, the authors categorized 47 successfully propagated innovations identified by members of the STEM education community (Khatri et al. 2013 b; Khatri et al. 2015) in addition to using the literature and 76 funded CCLI proposals. Because the project team did not have {{a detailed description of the}} <b>propagation</b> <b>plan</b> for each of the 47 successful innovations, propagation plans of these innovations could not be analyzed, but these 47 successfully propagated innovations were helpful in developing the product type and features of the DSAAI. Finally, a sixth research team member who did not take part in the initial development of the assessment instrument also tested the instrument by independently rating proposals.|$|E
30|$|Every year, {{significant}} {{effort and}} resources are expended {{around the world}} to develop innovative instructional strategies and materials to improve undergraduate Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics education. Despite convincing evidence of efficacy with respect to student learning, most will struggle to become successfully propagated to reach widespread use. To help developers improve their <b>propagation</b> <b>plans</b> and to encourage sustained adoption, we have developed an assessment instrument that supports development, analysis, evaluation, and refinement of <b>propagation</b> <b>plans.</b>|$|R
30|$|Based on our {{synthesis}} of the literature, our analysis of successfully propagated innovations, and our analysis of a subset of funded NSF CCLI proposals, we argue that a primary reason {{for the lack of}} adoption is that developers focus their efforts on dissemination (spreading the word) instead of propagation (promoting successful adoption). To help developers focus on development of more effective <b>propagation</b> <b>plans,</b> the Designing for Sustained Adoption Assessment Instrument (DSAAI) is based on three primary bodies of literature: (1) change theory, (2) instructional systems, and (3) effective propagation strategies. The assessment instrument was designed {{in the form of a}} rubric to help education developers identify strengths and areas for improvement of their <b>propagation</b> <b>plans.</b> Based on extensive testing across several different groups of users, the DSAAI is divided into four main sections: identification of product type, features of target instructional strategies and/or materials, a propagation activities checklist, and aspects of the <b>propagation</b> <b>plans</b> that influence likelihood of successful propagation.|$|R
30|$|After the {{instrument}} was revised using feedback from these groups, the next draft of the DSAAI was used by eight education developers and a grant writing consultant (representing two of our target audiences) during a face-to-face workshop in October 2014. Participants used the DSAAI to analyze and improve the <b>propagation</b> <b>plans</b> for their recently funded projects or proposals in development. These eight users found the DSAAI to be very useful and beneficial in evaluating <b>propagation</b> <b>plans</b> and reported that it provided new ideas about propagation {{that they had not}} considered before. The workshop participants also found the language to be very accessible and only suggested a few minor alterations to help improve clarity. In addition, the participants were able to consistently use the DSAAI but acknowledged they required a small amount of training to achieve that consistency. The need for training was also noted by the project team in subsequent workshops.|$|R
30|$|To {{propagate}} educational innovations, that is, {{to promote}} broader, sustained adoption, the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded the authors (Henderson et al. 2011 b) to create resources that educational developers {{can use to}} develop and implement effective propagation plans. One resource is the Designing for Sustained Adoption Assessment Instrument (DSAAI), a tool to characterize and assess a <b>propagation</b> <b>plan.</b> In this paper, we describe development and features of the instrument.|$|E
30|$|The {{descriptors}} {{for each}} criterion serve {{to aid in}} the evaluation of a <b>propagation</b> <b>plan</b> and {{as a model for the}} design of more effective propagation plans. Ultimately, the last section of the instrument is intended to determine how well the propagation strategies identified by the developers take into consideration the intended audience, the degree to which the innovation deviates from standard practice, the type of support needed by adopters, and other factors that will influence adoption.|$|E
30|$|The {{next step}} was to test the {{instrument}} with different populations to ensure that members of the intended audience for the DSAAI were consistent in interpreting the assessment instrument and scoring the propagation plans of different educational innovations, including their own. As described above, we invited eight education developers and one grant writing consultant to participate in a workshop to test the products we had developed, including the DSAAI. For this workshop, each participant applied the instrument to a short summary of a <b>propagation</b> <b>plan</b> for each participant’s recently funded project or proposal in development. While our initial purpose for the DSAAI was to characterize proposals, the workshop participants also found it helped them frame their thinking about propagation, gave them ideas for how to more explicitly address the different components of an effective <b>propagation</b> <b>plan,</b> and how propagation {{is an important part of}} the larger project when designing educational innovation. Prior to any training, the initial use of the DSAAI to evaluate the participants’ proposals resulted in 55  % agreement within one score for each category. However, after instruction and discussion regarding features that are required to design a successful <b>propagation</b> <b>plan</b> (using our “How-To” Guide), agreement increased to over 80  % for subsequent use of the DSAAI. This demonstrated that in order to be successful in applying the DSAAI, members of the intended audience need to develop a basic understanding of change theory and the instructional system in order to shift their thinking about what constitutes effective propagation. This information can be learned by attending a workshop or by working through the How-To Guide and workbook designed to be used in conjugation with the DSAAI (Henderson et al. 2015). The instrument has been further tested with about 30 participants in a session at the 2015 National Organization of Research Development Professionals (NORDP) annual conference and 24 faculty members who were developing IUSE proposals to be submitted in either November 2015 or January 2016.|$|E
30|$|While {{this study}} focused on the {{innovations}} that were well propagated, another avenue for study is studying innovations that were funded but did not reach a level of significant use. One study has done something similar to this by analyzing the <b>propagation</b> <b>plans</b> {{of a set of}} funded proposals and looking at outcomes several years later (Stanford et al., in press). A comparative analysis of well-propagated and not-as-well-propagated funded innovations could further illuminate factors related to propagation.|$|R
30|$|The {{instrument}} {{has proven}} useful {{for a variety}} of audiences to evaluate and improve proposals and current research projects. Education developers who provided feedback during the development of this assessment instrument found it useful because it helped them not only evaluate their <b>propagation</b> <b>plans</b> but also become aware of other strategies they could use to help develop and disseminate products of current projects, as well as strategies for supporting future adopters. Grant writing consultants can use it to provide feedback to their clients, and funding agencies can use parts of the DSAAI framework to evaluate grant proposals.|$|R
30|$|The DSAAI {{is part of}} a set {{of related}} {{resources}} that include a How-To Guide (Henderson et al. 2015), an executive summary, and a workbook. Our goal is for these resources to support efforts to increase the impact of education innovations. One way education developers can use the DSAAI is to help shape and evaluate their proposals and projects by identifying strengths and areas of improvement for their <b>propagation</b> <b>plans.</b> The evaluation of proposals is important in determining the likelihood an innovation can be successfully propagated based on the propagation strategies selected and how well they match the features of the innovation. Even pilot projects that are focusing on development of an education innovation should engage in best practices that make it more likely that a successful product can be propagated at a later stage of the project. The users who provided feedback during the development of this assessment instrument found it useful because it helped them not only evaluate their <b>propagation</b> <b>plans</b> but also become aware of other strategies they could use to help develop and disseminate their products, as well as strategies for supporting future adopters. Grant writing consultants can use it to provide feedback to their clients, and funding agencies can use parts of the DSAAI framework to evaluate grant proposals. We hope that these resources will serve to improve propagation practices and accelerate additional research into what is required for effective propagation of education innovations.|$|R
30|$|As stated above, {{propagation}} plans should {{depend on}} the type of educational innovation. This section of the assessment instrument is included to classify various types of educational innovations. Classifying product type helps identify the primary goal of the innovation and what major changes potential adopters must make to adopt the innovation. For example, educational innovations vary greatly in the resources, cooperation, and the degree of change to traditional teaching methods needed to successfully adopt and implement. Innovations that require more effort to implement require a more extensive <b>propagation</b> <b>plan</b> to achieve sustained adoption of the developed products.|$|E
30|$|Different {{propagation}} {{activities are}} important during the {{different stages of}} a project: getting started, refinement, and expansion. While a particular proposal may only focus {{on one or two}} of these stages, it is important to always keep the big picture in mind. Identifying the different types of propagation activities used helped raters determine the thoroughness of the <b>propagation</b> <b>plan</b> and the stage at which a project team intended to consider propagation. It is not expected that developers of educational innovations should use every method but that project teams select the methods that fit best with the product type and key features of the innovation being developed. This checklist is descriptive, not evaluative.|$|E
30|$|Our {{synthesis}} of the literature suggests that improving {{the likelihood that a}} project will be successful and have an impact on undergraduate STEM education depends on project design and strategies that facilitate adoption and adaptation of new learning materials and teaching strategies from the beginning. The authors applied what is known about change theory, the instructional system, and effective propagation strategies and developed the Designing for Sustained Adoption Assessment Instrument to analyze strengths and weaknesses of a <b>propagation</b> <b>plan.</b> Our goal is to help developers improve their efforts in creating new learning materials and teaching strategies with an eye towards eventual use by others, employing more effective strategies for developing instructor expertise in using new learning materials and teaching strategies, and addressing challenges to widespread implementation of educational innovations.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a novel {{technique}} for the approximation of three-dimensional (3 -D) antenna radiation patterns is presented. The proposed method combines the two principal cuts {{in order to}} acquire an adequate estimate of the 3 -D antenna radiation solid. The absolute error from the theoretical solution is analyzed along with other statistical measures for various types of antenna struc-tures, namely omni-directional and directive arrays. The perfor-mance of the method is compared against other existing extrapo-lation algorithms. The proposed technique exhibits low approxi-mation errors and is easily integrated into 3 -D radio <b>propagation</b> <b>planning</b> tools (such as ray-tracing algorithms).

30|$|The DSAAI was {{designed}} with features {{similar to that}} of an analytic rubric. Rubrics are effective at increasing consistency of judgment by individuals when assessing tasks, increasing consistency of scoring by different raters, and helping provide focused feedback about the task (Jonsson and Svingby 2007). We envision the primary use of this tool to be self-assessment of <b>propagation</b> <b>plans</b> by education developers. This assessment instrument is also useful as an analytical tool for researchers and grant writing consultants to examine and assess proposals and project plans. In this way, it provides a common evaluative instrument with which to compare multiple proposals and project plans and to summarize the results of such analysis.|$|R

Thirty-nine of the 270 or so cyprinid species that occur in North America are threatened or endangered, and 29 of those occupy arid river basins in the southwestern US (US Fish and Wildlife Service 2002).

40|$|Abstract: The PhET Interactive Simulations are {{well-known}} {{resources that}} originated in physics {{and are now}} used in multiple science disciplines. Many new educational innovations are developed but do not find a large audience—PhET, however, {{has been successful in}} becoming widely-used. This is the first of several planned case studies of widely-used educational innovations to characterize the strategies used by principle investigators (PIs) to promote widespread use of their innovation. We collected multiple sources of data, including interviews with the original developers, relevant publications, and documents released by the PhET team over the years. We analyzed the interview data and documents using a predetermined lens and constructed a narrative of key events and strategies. We found the PhET team refined and solidified the simulations after a period of pilot testing, and additional funding prompted new phases of propagation. With these results we refined our framework of successful propagation. The results of this work may help future PIs design a <b>propagation</b> <b>plan</b> for their innovation...|$|E
30|$|During the {{development}} process, the authors wanted {{to ensure the}} instrument could be consistently interpreted by users other than its developers. After three rounds of revision and testing, the authors {{had the opportunity to}} ask 70 participants at the January 2013 NSF TUES PI (Transforming Undergraduate Education in STEM Principal Investigator) Conference to evaluate two proposals using a draft of the assessment instrument. The assessment instrument was also reviewed by members of the Analytical Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (ANAPOGIL) consortium and members of our NSF project advisory board. These groups confirmed the face validity of the instrument and provided suggestions to improve ease of use. These users reported they found the DSAAI highlighted appropriate aspects relevant to supporting propagation and was very helpful in evaluating the different components required for propagation of educational innovations. Suggestions were also provided as to how to make the language more accessible to individuals without a strong background in change theory and to further divide the feature section so one can more easily distinguish pieces of a <b>propagation</b> <b>plan.</b>|$|E
30|$|Much {{is known}} about {{effective}} propagation that would help project teams develop innovations that {{are more likely to}} propagate widely. However, this knowledge resides in many different journals representing a wide variety of disciplines (Henderson et al. 2011 a; National Research Council 2012). There are considerable knowledge bases both on approaches to promote adoption of innovations (Rogers 2003; Wejnert 2002; Strang and Soule 1998) and organizational change (Weick and Quinn 1999; Kotter 1996; Van de Ven and Poole 1995). Resources are available that describe effective dissemination (Froyd 2001; Litzinger et al. 2011) and that provide organizational frameworks related to change in STEM education (Henderson et al. 2011 a; Borrego and Henderson 2014; Hinton et al. 2011). While all of these resources exist, educational developers who want to apply these frameworks must synthesize their own approaches and evaluation tools. One resource, the D-Cubed framework (Hinton et al. 2011), explains how developers can build propagation strategies into their project design, and suggests the framework could be applied to evaluate a <b>propagation</b> <b>plan,</b> but does not provide tools to facilitate such evaluation. Therefore, we synthesized these frameworks to create the DSAAI to support development, analysis, evaluation, and refinement of propagation plans.|$|E
30|$|These {{findings}} {{have implications for}} modifying existing funding structures. A typical grant for an education project lasts 3 or 4  years, so getting to the 8 – 10  years of funding that we found as a minimum for successful propagation means pursuing multiple grants. Developers often think that publishing and presenting results of the work {{at the end of}} a 3 -year grant will mean the innovation reaches others. However, the implication here is that in addition to having a good idea, developers need to be willing and able to spend a decade or more working on an innovation and pursuing funding opportunities in order to develop something that can be well-propagated. As a result, funding agencies may wish to consider extension funding mechanisms for educational innovations that have demonstrated progress on developing, implementing, and evaluating <b>propagation</b> <b>plans</b> during the initial 3 – 4 -year grant period.|$|R

30|$|The {{findings}} regarding {{funding of the}} branded innovations have implications for educational developers. First, based on this study, characteristics of innovations likely to be broadly adopted can be identified at the proposal review stage. This study has found that innovations requiring content changes are unlikely to propagate widely using existing strategies. Therefore, if {{the goal of a}} project is broad adoption, then projects expecting significant content change should either propose significantly different propagation strategies or not be undertaken. Second, branded, broadly-adopted innovations received significant funding over a minimum of 8  years. For projects aiming for broad propagation and expecting pedagogical change, <b>propagation</b> <b>plans</b> should be developed with long-time horizons. Educational development projects may have goals other than broad adoption within a 10 -year time horizon; for example, projects may be funded to stimulate consideration of a variety of very different content in some established courses. If this is the case, then goals for these projects should be clear to both developers and any organizations funding these projects.|$|R

30|$|Because {{developers}} {{might use}} {{more than one}} strategy, these implicit assumptions became a separate section of the assessment instrument, where the rater would select all that applied. As the research team continued to analyze proposals, {{there was always a}} large amount of discrepancy between raters about selected assumptions, and it was difficult to come to a consensus. After much discussion, it was determined that we were trying to identify two separate things in this section of the assessment instrument: the primary focus of the “change strategy” and what project teams were doing to help propagate the innovation. It was at this point that the Implicit Assumptions Behind Propagation Strategies section was removed from the assessment instrument and divided into two separate pieces: a checklist of the Propagation Activities used and the Primary Focus of the “Change Strategy.” Testing of assessment instrument led to the decision that the Primary Focus of the “Change Strategy” section was not useful to developers for developing and rating their own propagation plans. Based on the feedback from education developers, this section was found to be too abstract to understand without an extensive knowledge of change theory and did not provide meaning information to the education developers on the strengths and weakness of their <b>propagation</b> <b>plan</b> or how to improve it. The research team has continued to use this analysis to characterize proposals, but it is not included in the DSAAI itself.|$|E

The need to quickly and e#ciently provide in-building and microcellular coverage without sacrificing quality is critical to cellular and emerging personal communication system (PCS) operators.

This thesis describes the algorithms and technical considerations implemented in a comprehensive <b>propagation</b> <b>planning</b> tool, SMT Plus, which has been designed to predict the coverage regions of both in-building and microcellular wireless communication systems. The goal of SMT Plus is to provide both wireless service providers and equipment manufacturers with an e#cient, easy-to-use coverage prediction tool for use in the design of any indoor or campus-wide wireless system. Using site-specific building information combined with on-site signal strength measurements, the tool provides system planners with a highly accurate model of the propagation environment among a group of buildings.

Based on the ZK-Burgers equation, the conservation laws of three-dimensional Rossby solitary waves are discussed and given in Section  3. In Section  4, we give the classical solitary wave solutions of the ZK-Burgers equation by using the sine-cosine method and the rational solutions by using the Hirota method. The rational solutions of ZK equation are obtained firstly in this paper. Based on these analytical solutions, the dissipation and chirp effect is discussed.
