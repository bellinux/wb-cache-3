50|$|Although {{spacecraft}} have travelled {{many times}} in the inner and outer orbit of Earth since the 1960s, the spacecraft ATS 5 was the first major plasma experiment performed that could reliably determine the existence of radial injections driven by interchange motions. The analysis revealed the frequent injection of a hot plasma cloud is injected inward during a substorm in the outer layers of the magnetosphere et al. 1971. The injections occur predominantly in the night-time hemisphere, being associated with the depolarization of the neutral sheet configuration in the tail regions of the magnetosphere. This paper then implies that Earth’s magnetotail region is a major mechanism in which the magnetosphere stores and releases energy through the interchange mechanism.The interchange instability also has been found to have a limiting factor on the night side <b>plasmapause</b> thickness et al. 1990. In this paper, the <b>plasmapause</b> is found to be near the geosynchronous orbit in which the centrifugal and gravitational potential cancel exactly. This sharp change in plasma pressure associated with the plasma pause enables this instability.

First, we explore the effects of <b>plasmapause</b> extent on ground‐based observations of chorus via a 3 month study of ground‐based measurements of chorus at Palmer Station, Antarctica (L = 2. 4, 50 °S geomagnetic latitude), and data on the <b>plasmapause</b> extent from the IMAGE EUV instrument. It is found that chorus normalized occurrence peaks when the <b>plasmapause</b> is at L ∼ 2. 6, somewhat higher than Palmer's L shell, and that this occurrence peak persists across a range of observed chorus frequencies. Next, reverse ray tracing is employed to evaluate the portion of the equatorial chorus source region, distributed in radial distance and wave normal, from which chorus is able to reach Palmer Station via propagation in a nonducted mode. The results of ray tracing are similar to those of observations, with a peak of expected occurrence when the <b>plasmapause</b> is at L ∼ 3. The exact location of the peak is frequency dependent. This supports the conclusion that the ability of chorus to propagate to low altitudes and the ground is a strong function of instantaneous <b>plasmapause</b> extent and that peak occurrence of chorus at a given ground station may occur when the L shell of the <b>plasmapause</b> is somewhat beyond that of the observing station. These results also suggest that chorus observed on the ground at midlatitude stations propagates predominantly in the nonducted mode...|$|E
