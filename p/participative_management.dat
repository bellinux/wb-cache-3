Thus, the dilemma: on the one hand, there is a demand to engage and consult many actors; on the other hand, low social capital contributes to an administrative culture with a ubiquitous top-down approach taken by institutional decision-makers.

Until the mid- 1990 s, the forests of Cameroon were centrally managed, which excluded communities from accessing forest resources and gaining economic benefits from them.

The new forestry legislation of 1994 – focusing on the devolution of management responsibilities to local communities – has reinforced this participatory trend.

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} pieces of this theory is that management must have a high degree of confidence in its workers in order for this type of <b>participative</b> <b>management</b> to work. This theory assumes that workers will be participating in the decisions of the company to a great degree. Ouchi explains that the employees must be very knowledgeable about the various issues of the company, as well as possessing the competence to make those decisions. He also points out; however, that management sometimes has a tendency to underestimate the ability of the workers to effectively contribute to the decision making process (Bittel, 1989). But for this reason, Theory Z stresses the need for the workers to become generalists, rather than specialists, and to increase their knowledge of the company and its processes through job rotations and constant training. Actually, promotions tend to be slower in this type of setting, as workers are given a much longer opportunity to receive training and more time to learn {{the ins and outs of}} the company's operations. The desire, under this theory, is to develop a work force, which has more of a loyalty towards staying with the company for an entire career, and be more permanent than in other types of settings. It is expected that once an employee does rise to a position of high level management, they will know a great deal more about the company and how it operates, and will be able to use Theory Z management theories effectively on the newer employees (Luthans, 1989, p. 36).|$|E

40|$|Agent-based {{modelling}} {{can be used}} as a {{tool for}} <b>participative</b> water <b>management</b> support. Within this framework, we want to develop architectural features that can improve system understanding at the collective and individual levels. We present a modelling framework which aims at bringing particular insights into the interrelations between temporal, spatial and social scales of the resource management process. To study these links, we adopt an approach based on the notions of role, group and agent: roles represent the functions of agents as members of a group; a group consists of a set of agents that interact in a process through their roles. In this way, groups describe collective structures through behavior types given by roles. Agents executing roles modulate these collective behavior types through their individual features. Agents carrying out several roles undertake a superposition of behaviors induced by collective dynamics. The Agent-Group-Role structure building process is carried out by developing models within a research project that supports a co-decision procedure taking place in the French Drôme River basin. We validate the features of our framework through regular field testing of the models we build on top of it. We extend and enhance our framework through progressive complexity augmentation of these models. In conclusion, we aim at demonstrating the suitability of the Agent-Group-Role formalism for the resolution of the duality between individual and collective levels of a system...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the impact of managers’ participation in costing system design on process improvements. Drawing from the literature on business process <b>management,</b> <b>participative</b> decision making and self-determination theory, we propose that participation in costing system design fosters process improvements through managers’ autonomous motivation for cost management and their perceived usefulness of cost information. Questionnaire data obtained from 173 Belgian managers were used to test the proposed model. The results suggest that participation in costing system design increases managers’ autonomous motivation for cost management and enhances their perceived usefulness of cost information. The perceived usefulness of cost information, in turn, results in process improvements. The effect of managers’ autonomous motivation for cost management on process improvements is, however, not significant. Taken together, our findings imply that process improvements mainly emerge through cognitive mechanisms rather than motivational mechanisms triggered by the participation process...|$|R
