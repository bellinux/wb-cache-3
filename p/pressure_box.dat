50|$|An {{integral}} part of the thermoforming process is the tooling which is specific to each part that is to be produced. Thin-gauge thermoforming as described above is almost always performed on in-line machines and typically requires molds, plug assists, <b>pressure</b> <b>boxes</b> and all mounting plates as well as the trim tooling and stacker parts that pertain to the job. Thick or heavy-gauge thermoforming also requires tooling specific to each part, but because the part size can be very large, the molds can be cast aluminum or some other composite material as well as machined aluminum as in thin gauge. Typically thick-gauge parts must be trimmed on CNC routers or hand trimmed using saws or hand routers. Even the most sophisticated thermoforming machine is limited {{to the quality of the}} tooling. Some large thermoforming manufacturers choose to have design and tool making facilities in house while others will rely on outside tool-making shops to build the tooling.|$|R

Previous reports have noted a difference {{between men and women}} in PU development related to the supine position, and body weight and body mass index (BMI) have been also described as known risk factors in supine position-related PU development. The BIG-MAT® system is a noninvasive pressure distribution measurement device used to measure external pressure (EP). We used this system to investigate the relationship between EP to the sacral region in the lithotomy position and selected physical characteristics. Methods: We recruited 21 young, healthy volunteers (11 men and 10 women, aged 21. 4 ± 0. 5 years). Using the BIG-MAT system, we measured four types of EP to the sacral region: <b>box</b> <b>pressure,</b> peak <b>box</b> <b>pressure,</b> contact pressure, and peak contact pressure. We analyzed the relationships between these dynamic parameters and physical characteristics of the participants. Results: There were no {{differences between men and women}} in the four types of EP, and no significant differences related to the participants’ height, weight, or BMI. Conclusion: An individual’s height, weight, and BMI may not contribute to the risk of inducing lithotomy position-related PUs in the sacral region.

Obesity has been implicated as a risk factor in the lithotomy position-related WLCS during surgery. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between the external pressure (EP) applied to the calf region using a KCLH system in the lithotomy position and selected physical characteristics. Methods: Twenty-one young, healthy volunteers (21. 4 ± 0. 5  years of age, eleven males and ten females) participated in this study. The KCLH system used was Knee Crutch®. We assessed four types of EPs applied to the calf region: <b>box</b> <b>pressure,</b> peak <b>box</b> <b>pressure,</b> contact pressure, and peak contact pressure, using pressure-distribution measurement system (BIG-MAT®). Relationships between these four EPs to the calf regions of both lower legs and a series of physical characteristics (sex, height, weight, and body mass index [BMI]) were analyzed. Results: All four EPs applied to the bilateral calf regions were higher in males than in females. For all subjects, significant positive correlations were observed between all four EPs and height, weight, and BMI. Conclusion: EP applied to the calf region is higher in males than in females when the subject is supported by a KCLH system in the lithotomy position. In addition, EP increases with the increase in height, weight, and BMI. Therefore, male sex, height, weight, and BMI may contribute to the risk of inducing WLCS.

The cryogenic cooling system uses liquid helium and liquid nitrogen to simulate liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen tank internal temperatures.

The Pultruded Rod Stitched Efficient Unitized Structure (PRSEUS) is an integrally stiffened panel design where elements are stitched together and designed to maintain residual load-carrying capabilities under a variety of damage scenarios. With the PRSEUS concept, through-the-thickness stitches are applied through dry fabric prior to resin infusion, and replace fasteners throughout each integral panel. Through-the-thickness reinforcement at discontinuities, such as along flange edges, has been shown to suppress delamination and turn cracks, which expands the design space and leads to lighter designs. The pultruded rod provides stiffening away from the more vulnerable skin surface and improves bending stiffness. A series of building blocks were evaluated to explore the fundamental assumptions related to the capability and advantages of PRSEUS panels. These building blocks addressed tension, compression, and pressure loading conditions. The emphasis of the development work has been to assess the loading capability, damage arrestment features, repairability, post-buckling behavior, and response of PRSEUS flat panels to out-of plane pressure loading.
