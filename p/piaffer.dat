50|$|By {{the end of}} {{the month}} he had ridden 31 winners in the month and 109 thus far for the season: a long way ahead of his {{previous}} scoring rate (even 1967). His chief pursuers were champion Willie Carson and Pat Eddery but Mercer’s ten doubles and one treble in August kept Carson 10 to 20 winners behind. Important wins in the month (after Goodwood) were <b>Piaffer</b> (Rose of York Handicap), Odeon (Galtres Stakes), Connaught Bridge and Kris. In addition a promising two-year-old in the shape of Charles St George’s Ginistrelli appeared at Yarmouth to win comfortably on his debut. Mercer missed this colt’s second win a few weeks later as he was riding at another meeting.|$|E
