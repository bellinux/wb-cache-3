40|$|Reinforcement {{learning}} treats each input, feature, or stimulus {{as having}} a positive or negative reward value. Some stimuli, however, negate or inhibit the values of certain other predictors (excitors) when presented with them, but are otherwise neutral. We show that both linear and non-linear value-function approximators assign inhibitory features a strong value with the opposite valence of the predic-tor it inhibits (i. e., inhibitor =-excitor). In one circumstance, this gives a cor-rect prediction (i. e., excitor + inhibitor = neutral outcome). Importantly, however, value-function approximators incorrectly predict that when the inhibitor is pre-sented alone, a negative or oppositely valenced outcome will follow whereas the inhibitor alone is actually followed by a neutral outcome. Essentially, we show that having reward value as a direct predictive target can make inhibitors indistin-guishable from excitors that predict the oppositely valenced outcome. We show that this problem can be easily avoided if the reinforcement learning problem is broken into 1) a supervised learning module that predicts the positive appearance of <b>primary</b> <b>reinforcements</b> and 2) a reinforcement learning module which sums their agent-defined values. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the paper}} is to {{describe}} the main advantages of using innovative engineered systems to build reinforced soil structures compared to traditional ones. In particular the paper refers to “hybrid” systems which combine planar polymeric reinforcements (geogrids) and steel wire mesh units {{in order to build}} high MSE walls (inclination ≥ 70 °, up to almost 90 °) or slopes (inclination < 70 °). Both the components act as reinforcements and as stabilizing elements. Geogrids are considered to work as <b>primary</b> <b>reinforcements</b> since they guarantee the overall and compound internal stability of the structure. Whereas the wire mesh units are considered a secondary reinforcement providing the local stability at the facing, ensuring that no local mechanism of direct sliding, pull-out or rotational failure occurs. Results on existing structures indicate that, as structures achieve relevant heights (above 10 m), there is a large potential for cost effectiveness in using wire mesh and grids combined, in place of a 100 % geogrids or a 100 % steel mesh reinforcement solution only [1, 2]. Very high hybrid structures have been built all over the world following the mentioned approach. With this paper, three relevant case histories are presented. Firstly, a 80 m high reinforced soil hybrid structure built as retaining structure for a new airport construction in India. Secondly, a 40 m high reinforced soil hybrid structure, built as support {{for the construction of a}} highway in Albania.

Here, we investigated the impact of different <b>reinforcement</b> (no <b>reinforcement,</b> <b>primary</b> positive <b>reinforcement)</b> or action (scratch the wither) on the horses’ attentional state in a learning task. In a first study, 15 young males Angloarabian were trained to remain still in response to a vocal command. Immobility was rewarded either with a piece of food (n= 8) or with no reward (n= 7). In a second study, 15 young polish horses (6 females, 9 males) were trained to the same task, but here, immobility was rewarded either with a piece of food (n= 8) or with a tactile contact (scratching on the withers during 5 seconds, n= 7). For both studies, monitoring, gazes and behaviours directed towards the trainer revealed that the use of a food reward as positive reinforcement increased horses’ selective attention towards their trainer (MW, P< 0. 05 in all cases). These studies suggest that attention may well be the process underlying the efficiency of appropriate reinforcements leading to better learning performances. This also explains increased bonding in human-animal training situations when positive emotions are involved. Horse attentional state is a key for better interaction, better security and better performances in a working situation. Nevertheless, only individuals can tell what an appropriate reward is and which reward induces positive emotions and hence triggers attention...|$|R

In the absence of observing responses in both components, unsignaled periods of variable-interval (VI) schedule food reinforcement alternated with extinction. Observing responses in both components intermittently produced 15  s of a stimulus associated with the VI schedule (i. e., S+). In the first experiment, a lower-valued conditioned reinforcer and a higher rate of <b>primary</b> <b>reinforcement</b> were arranged in one component by adding response-independent food deliveries uncorrelated with S+. In the second experiment, one component arranged a lower valued conditioned reinforcer but a higher rate of <b>primary</b> <b>reinforcement</b> by increasing the probability of VI schedule periods relative to extinction periods. In the third experiment, the two observing-response components provided similar rates of <b>primary</b> <b>reinforcement</b> but arranged different valued conditioned reinforcers. Across the three experiments, observing-response rates were typically higher in the component associated with the higher valued conditioned reinforcer.

One interpretation of these results is that S+ value does not affect response strength and that S+ deliveries increase response rates through a mechanism other than reinforcement.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{need for}} regional development has led engineers to find safe ways {{to construct the}} infrastructure of transportation on soft soils. Soft soil {{is not able to}} sustain external loads without having large deformations. The geotechnical properties of soft soil which is known for its low bearing capacity, high water content, high compressibility and long term settlement as well. In pavement engineering, either highway or runway as an infrastructure, a pavement encompasses three important parts namely traffic load, pavement and subgrade. Traffic load generated from tire pressure of vehicle and/or airplane wheels are usually around 550 kPa even more {{on the surface of the}} pavement. Pavement generally comprises granular materials with unbounded or bounded materials located between traffic load and subgrade, distributing the load to surface of subgrade. One of the promising soil improvement techniques is a piled embankment. When geosynthetics layer is unrolled over piles, it is known as geosynthetics supported piled embankment. Particularly in deep soft soil, when piles do not reach a hard stratum due to large thickness of the soft soil, the construction is an embankment on floating piles. Furthermore, because of different stiffness between piles and subsoil, soil arching effect would be developed there. By using Finite Element analysis, some findings resulted from experimental works and several field tests around the world as field case studies are verified. Some important findings are as follows: the stress concentration ratio is not a single value, but it would be changed depending on the height of embankment, consolidation process of subsoil, surcharge of traffic load, and tensile modulus of geosynthetics as well. Ratio height of embankment to clear piles spacing (h/s) around 1. 4 can be used as a critical value to distinguish between low embankment and high embankment. When geosynthetics is applied to reinforce a pavement/embankment, the vertical distance of geosynthetics layers and number of geosynthetics layers depend on the quality of pavement material. The lower layer of geosynthetics withstands a tensile stress higher than upper layer. <b>Primary</b> <b>reinforcements</b> for geosynthetics in piled embankments are located at span between piles with maximum strains at zones of adjacent piles. Traffic load that passes through on the surface of the pavement can reduce the soil arching, but it can be restored during the off peak hours. Settlements of embankments on floating piles can accurately be modelled using the consolidation calculation type, whereas the end-bearing piles may be used the plastic calculation type. Longer piles can be effectively applied to reduce a creep. By applying length of floating piles more than 20 % of soft soil depth, it would have a significant impact to reduce a creep on a deep soft soil...|$|R

40|$|Pigeons {{were trained}} on a two-key choice {{procedure}} {{in which a}} pair of equal and concurrently available variable-interval schedules (initial links) arranged entry into {{one or the other}} of two mutually exclusive schedules (terminal links) that ended in <b>primary</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> The terminal links were two-component chained or tandem schedules. Responses during the initial links were distributed equally on the two keys whenever the terminal links were associated with the same sets of interreinforcement intervals. Whether or not the terminal-link interreinforcement intervals were the same on the two keys, initial-link responding was affected by neither the presence nor relative durations of differentially signalled components within a terminal-link schedule. The simplest interpretation of these results is that initial-link responding is maintained directly by delayed <b>primary</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> rather than conditioned reinforcement afforded by the stimuli correlated with the terminal-link schedule components.

40|$|Attentional biases {{occur with}} various {{psychological}} disorders, including drugaddiction and anxiety. Conditioned reinforcement likely {{plays a role}} in maintainingattentional biases to stimuli associated with reinforcement for unwanted behavior. Theobserving-response procedure is considered a model of attending as reflected byresponding maintained by conditioned reinforcement. Effects of <b>primary</b> <b>reinforcement</b> on the persistence of observing have been studied in the framework of behavioral momentum theory. Studies have shown observing-responses to be more resistant tochange in contexts arranging relatively higher rates of <b>primary</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> Recently, behavioral momentum theory has been extended to describe the effects of <b>primary</b> <b>reinforcement</b> context in relapse phenomena. The present thesis aimed to extend research on the resistance to change of observing to animal models of relapse. Pigeons responded on a two-component multiple schedule of observing-response procedures. In a rich component, observing responses produced stimuli correlated with a high rate of variableinterval (VI) food reinforcement (Rich S+). In a lean component, observing responses produced stimuli correlated with a low rate of VI food reinforcement (Lean S+). Following stable performance, responding was extinguished by removing food and S+ presentations. After extinction, relapse was assessed by reinstatement tests consisting of response-independent presentations of food or S+. Replicating earlier results, observingand food-key responding was more resistant to extinction in the Rich component. Food reinstatement had no systematic effect on extinguished food- and observing-key responding. However, S+ reinstatement resulted in relapse of extinguished observingand food-key responding. Relapse during S+ reinstatement was greater in the Rich component than the Lean component. Reinstatement of responding by S+ presentations resulted in a greater overall increase in responding on the food-key relative to the observing-key. This result suggests that an important functional relationship between the presence of S+ stimuli and increased rates of <b>primary</b> <b>reinforcement</b> for food key responding remained intact during extinction. The results show that observing is susceptible to relapse, and the magnitude of relapse depends on baseline <b>primary</b> <b>reinforcement</b> rate in a context...|$|E

Three pigeons were trained to respond for <b>primary</b> <b>reinforcement</b> (strong stimulus control condition), and three pigeons were trained to respond for conditioned reinforcement (weak stimulus control condition).

The delay-reduction hypothesis diverges from other conditioned reinforcement models in that it predicts that a fixed-duration food-paired stimulus will have different reinforcing values depending on the frequency of its presentation. In Experiment 1, pigeons' key pecks were reinforced according to concurrent-chains schedules with variable-interval 10 -second and variable-interval 20 -second terminal-link schedules. The initial-link schedule preceding the shorter terminal link was always variable-interval 60 seconds, and the initial-link schedule requirement preceding the longer terminal link was varied between 1 second and 60 seconds across conditions. In Experiment 2, the initial-link schedule preceding the longer of two terminal links was varied for each of three groups of pigeons. The terminal links of the concurrent chains for the three groups were variable-interval 10 seconds and 20 seconds, variable-interval 10 seconds and 30 seconds, and variable-interval 30 seconds and 50 seconds.

(203 x 152 x 2134 mm), reinforced with a single # 4 bar (12. 7 mm) as <b>primary</b> flexural <b>reinforcement.</b> Control specimens having a continuous bar and a conventional 18 in. (457 mm) contact lap splice serve to define the ‘target capacity’ for the CFRP-to-reinforcing steel splices. For the CFRP-to-reinforcing steel spliced beams, the reinforcing bar is terminated near midspan. A CFRP strip, designed to have a capacity {{equal to or greater}} than the bar is applied, lapped with the terminated bar and developed to the unreinforced end of the beam. The beams are tested in flexure under monotonically increasing loads to failure. Thus, after cracking, the beam capacity is entirely dependent on the force redistribution between the reinforcing steel in one half of the span and the CFRP strip in the other. This transfer occurs over the provided splice. Conventional lap splices between steel reinforcement are designed to provide enough development length to yield the bars. Therefore yielding of the primary reinforcing steel in the test specimens is an indication that the CFRP-to-reinforcing steel lap splice has sufficiently reached its design capacity. The test beams that were designed to have sufficient development lengths displayed the ability to yield the reinforcing steel; an indication that CFRP-to-reinforcing steel lap splices are a viable option. The test beams that were designed to have insufficient development length failed prior to the steel yielding. This was the anticipated result, since the purpose of these beams was to investigate the behavior and probable failure modes of under-designed CFRP-to-reinforcing steel splices...|$|R
