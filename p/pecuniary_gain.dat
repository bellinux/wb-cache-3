500|$|In {{a segment}} of the Investigation Discovery series Deadly Women {{covering}} the Kinne case, episode entitled [...] "Born bad", James Hays, author of I'm just an Ordinary Girl: The Sharon Kinne Story speculates that Kinne committed her first murder for <b>pecuniary</b> <b>gain,</b> hoping to cash in on James Kinne's life insurance policy, and that she began to derive pleasure from killing at that point. Former FBI profiler Candice DeLong supports this assertion with her theory that Kinne is a sociopath, lacking in remorse and empathy, and therefore had no compunction about killing to get what she wanted — be it life insurance, marriage to her boyfriend, or cash. This idea is echoed by some of those involved in prosecuting Kinne, who feel that she was a [...] "psychopath" [...] and born bad. [...] and that [...] "her solution to a problem was to kill somebody". Even those who believe in her guilt, however, note that Kinne had a certain appeal, describing her as [...] "rather attractive" [...] and admitting that they grew to like her. The Mammoth Book of True Crime describes her as a relative rarity, a [...] "pretty" [...] criminal.|$|E

The Secretary of State had probably not occupied his mind much with the matter; but in the mind of Bagwax there was a fixed idea that the Secretary thought of little else, and that the Secretary had declared that his hands were tied till Bagwax should have been to Sydney.

60|$|As {{might be}} expected, the most {{imperfect}} {{part of those}} branches of social inquiry which have been cultivated as separate sciences, is {{the theory of the}} manner in which their conclusions are affected by ethological considerations. The omission is no defect in them as abstract or hypothetical sciences, but it vitiates them in their practical application as branches of a comprehensive social science. In political economy, for instance, empirical laws of human nature are tacitly assumed by English thinkers, which are calculated only for Great Britain and the United States. Among other things, an intensity of competition is constantly supposed, which, as a general mercantile fact, exists in no country in the world except those two. An English political economist, like his countrymen in general, has seldom learned that it is possible that men, in conducting the business of selling their goods over a counter, should care more about their ease or their vanity than about their <b>pecuniary</b> <b>gain.</b> Yet those who know the habits of the continent of Europe are aware how apparently small a motive often outweighs the desire of money getting, even in the operations which have money getting for their direct object. The more highly the science of ethology is cultivated, and the better the diversities of individual and national character are understood, the smaller, probably, will the number of propositions become, which it will be considered safe to build on as universal principles of human nature.|$|E
60|$|There is in {{the above}} sketch {{something}} so extraordinary as to require further explanatory details.--And to begin with his industry; eight hours in each day, during five days in the week, and half of Saturday, except when the labours of husbandry were urgent, he was occupied in teaching. His seat was within the rails of the altar; the communion table was his desk; and, like Shenstone's schoolmistress, the master employed himself at the spinning-wheel, while the children were repeating their lessons by his side. Every evening, after school hours, if not more profitably engaged, he continued {{the same kind of}} labour, exchanging, for the benefit of exercise, the small wheel, at which he had sate, for the large one on which wool is spun, the spinner stepping to and fro. Thus, was the wheel constantly in readiness to prevent the waste of a moment's time. Nor was his industry with the pen, when occasion called for it, less eager. Intrusted with extensive management of public and private affairs, he acted, in his rustic neighbourhood, as scrivener, writing out petitions, deeds of conveyance, wills, covenants, &c., with <b>pecuniary</b> <b>gain</b> to himself, and to the great benefit of his employers. These labours (at all times considerable) at one period of the year, viz., between Christmas and Candlemas, when money transactions are settled in this country, were often so intense, that he passed great part of the night, and sometimes whole nights, at his desk. His garden also was tilled by his own hand; he had a right of pasturage upon the mountains for a few sheep and a couple of cows, which required his attendance; with this pastoral occupation, he joined the labours of husbandry upon a small scale, renting two or three acres in addition to his own less than one acre of glebe; and the humblest drudgery which the cultivation of these fields required was performed by himself.|$|E

Never was there, perhaps, more hollowness at heart than at present, {{and here in}} the United States. Genuine belief seems to have left us. The underlying principles of the States are not honestly believ'd in, (for all this hectic glow, and these melo-dramatic screamings,) nor is humanity itself believ'd in. What penetrating eye does not everywhere see through the mask? The spectacle is appaling. We live in an atmosphere of hypocrisy throughout. The men believe not in the women, nor the women in the men. A scornful superciliousness rules in literature. The aim of all the litterateurs is to find something to make fun of. A lot of churches, sects, &c., the most dismal phantasms I know, usurp the name of religion. Conversation is a mass of badinage. From deceit in the spirit, the mother of all false deeds, the offspring is already incalculable. An acute and candid person, in the revenue department in Washington, who is led by the course of his employment to regularly visit the cities, north, south and west, to investigate frauds, has talk'd much with me about his discoveries. The depravity of the business classes of our country is not less than has been supposed, but infinitely greater. The official services of America, national, state, and municipal, in all their branches and departments, except the judiciary, are saturated in corruption, bribery, falsehood, mal-administration; and the judiciary is tainted. The great cities reek with respectable as much as non-respectable robbery and scoundrelism. In fashionable life, flippancy, tepid amours, weak infidelism, small aims, or no aims at all, only to kill time.

True, indeed, behind this fantastic farce, enacted on the visible stage of society, solid things and stupendous labors are to be discover'd, existing crudely and going on in the background, to advance and tell themselves in time. Yet the truths are none the less terrible. I say that our New World democracy, however great a success in uplifting the masses out of their sloughs, in materialistic development, products, and in a certain highly-deceptive superficial popular intellectuality, is, so far, an almost complete failure in its social aspects, and in really grand religious, moral, literary, and esthetic results. In vain do we march with unprecedented strides to empire so colossal, outvying the antique, beyond Alexander's, beyond the proudest sway of Rome. In vain have we annex'd Texas, California, Alaska, and reach north for Canada and south for Cuba. It is as if we were somehow being endow'd with a vast and more and more thoroughly-appointed body, and then left with little or no soul.|$|E

The general approach shows how to distinguish the ultimate sources of labor-market returns to such characteristics; the specific example uses longitudinal data on a large sample of attorneys who graduated from one law school. Beauty is measured by ratings of their matriculation photographs. 1) Better-looking attorneys who graduated in the 1970 s earned more after 5 years of practice than their worse- looking classmates, other things equal, an effect that grew even larger by the fifteenth year of practice. There is no impact of beauty on earnings among 1980 s graduates. 2) Attorneys {{in the private sector}} are better-looking than those in the public sector, with the differences rising as workers sort across sector based on their beauty. 3) Male attorneys' probability of attaining an early partnership rises with beauty. The results support a theory of dynamic sorting and the role of customer behavior.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to offer an {{analysis}} of the nonprofit sector from the entrepreneurial point of view in order to show why the organizational form of nonprofit has arisen and, more precisely, why rational entrepreneurs choose to incorporate their business enterprises under the nonprofit regulation. Since nonprofit associations were formed before the emergence of the tax code, the favorable tax- status alone cannot explain an entrepreneurial preference for the nonprofit form. Tax considerations have then to be combined with other elements. The alternative view proposed in the paper is that the supply of factors such as capital and entrepreneurship provides the motivation for the rise of nonprofit enterprises. The entrepreneur and the managers enjoy control of the activity and see to it that service are produced in such a way as to maximize their net income. They do not ignore nonmonetary income in the sense that they find it rewarding to seek <b>pecuniary</b> <b>gains</b> as well as nonmonetary profits in any given period.

60|$|There {{is another}} {{question}} to which an answer must be found, consistent with the principles which have been laid down. In cases of personal conduct supposed to be blamable, but which respect for liberty precludes society from preventing or punishing, because the evil directly resulting falls wholly on the agent; what the agent is free to do, ought other persons to be equally free to counsel or instigate? This question is not free from difficulty. The case {{of a person who}} solicits another to do an act, is not strictly a case of self-regarding conduct. To give advice or offer inducements to any one, is a social act, and may therefore, like actions in general which affect others, be supposed amenable to social control. But a little reflection corrects the first impression, by showing that if the case is not strictly within the definition of individual liberty, yet the reasons on which the principle of individual liberty is grounded, are applicable to it. If people must be allowed, in whatever concerns only themselves, to act as seems best to themselves at their own peril, they must equally be free to consult with one another about what is fit to be so done; to exchange opinions, and give and receive suggestions. Whatever it is permitted to do, it must be permitted to advise to do. The question is doubtful, only when the instigator derives a personal benefit from his advice; when he makes it his occupation, for subsistence or <b>pecuniary</b> <b>gain,</b> to promote what society and the state consider to be an evil. Then, indeed, a new element of complication is introduced; namely, the existence of classes of persons with an interest opposed to what is considered as the public weal, and whose mode of living is grounded on the counteraction of it. Ought this to be interfered with, or not? Fornication, for example, must be tolerated, and so must gambling; but should a person be free to be a pimp, or to keep a gambling-house? The case is one of those which lie on the exact boundary line between two principles, and it is not at once apparent to which of the two it properly belongs. There are arguments on both sides. On the side of toleration it may be said, that the fact of following anything as an occupation, and living or profiting by the practice of it, cannot make that criminal which would otherwise be admissible; that the act should either be consistently permitted or consistently prohibited; that if the principles which we have hitherto defended are true, society has no business, as society, to decide anything to be wrong which concerns only the individual; that it cannot go beyond dissuasion, and that one person should be as free to persuade, as another to dissuade. In opposition to this it may be contended, that although the public, or the State, are not warranted in authoritatively deciding, for purposes of repression or punishment, that such or such conduct affecting only the interests of the individual is good or bad, they are fully justified in assuming, if they regard it as bad, that its being so or not is at least a disputable question: That, this being supposed, they cannot be acting wrongly in endeavouring to exclude the influence of solicitations which are not disinterested, of instigators who cannot possibly be impartial--who have a direct personal interest on one side, and that side the one which the State believes to be wrong, and who confessedly promote it for personal objects only. There can surely, it may be urged, be nothing lost, no sacrifice of good, by so ordering matters that persons shall make their election, either wisely or foolishly, on their own prompting, as free as possible from the arts of persons who stimulate their inclinations for interested purposes of their own. Thus (it may be said) though the statutes respecting unlawful games are utterly indefensible--though all persons should be free to gamble in their own or each other's houses, or in any place of meeting established by their own subscriptions, and open only to the members and their visitors--yet public gambling-houses should not be permitted. It is true that the prohibition is never effectual, and that whatever amount of tyrannical power is given to the police, gambling-houses can always be maintained under other pretences; but they may be compelled to conduct their operations with a certain degree of secrecy and mystery, so that nobody knows anything about them but those who seek them; and more than this, society ought not to aim at. There is considerable force in these arguments; I will not venture to decide whether they are sufficient to justify the moral anomaly of punishing the accessary, when the principal is (and must be) allowed to go free; or fining or imprisoning the procurer, but not the fornicator, the gambling-house keeper, but not the gambler. Still less ought the common operations of buying and selling to be interfered with on analogous grounds. Almost every article which is bought and sold may be used in excess, and the sellers have a pecuniary interest in encouraging that excess; but no argument can be founded on this, in favour, for instance, of the Maine Law; because the class of dealers in strong drinks, though interested in their abuse, are indispensably required for the sake of their legitimate use. The interest, however, of these dealers in promoting intemperance is a real evil, and justifies the State in imposing restrictions and requiring guarantees, which but for that justification would be infringements of legitimate liberty.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how job displacement and physical disability suffered by a spouse affects {{the probability that}} the person’s marriage ends in divorce. According to the standard economic model of marriage, the arrival of new information about a partner’s earning capacity that an earnings shock conveys might affect the gains that the couple believes it will receive from remaining married. Shocks may therefore affect divorce probability. Little previous work has explored this issue, and in that which has no explicit measures of earning shocks were used. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, this paper finds a short-term increase in the probability of divorce following a spouse’s job displacement but no change in divorce probability after a spousal disability. An important reason for the difference across the two types of shocks appears to be that certain types of job loss signal information about a partner’s non-economic suitability as a mate. 1 Introduction In standard economic models, marriage is presumed to confer <b>pecuniary</b> <b>gains</b> to spouses. 1 Events that lower a spouse’s earnings capacity may therefore be expected to affect the person’s family in two distinct ways.

However, there is little rigorous microeconomic explanation of union membership which is relevant {{for much of the}} U. K. and similar labour markets where the ‘open shop’ union is prevalent. This paper attempts to overcome the free-rider problem of explaining union membership in the open shop. We argue that both private <b>pecuniary</b> <b>gains</b> and social influences affect the individuals' union membership decisions, citing evidence in support of these basic assumptions. We show that stable intermediate union density is a possible equilibrium outcome in a generalised social custom model. We also analyse the simultaneous determination of wages and union membership, deriving a number of comparative static results. In particular, we find that both wages and union density depend upon, inter alia, the level of strike pay, the net cost of union membership and the individual's sensitivity to social custom and associated solidarity effects. We argue that the approach is consistent with various stylised facts concerning both wage bargaining and union membership and is able to explain a number of otherwise puzzling features of union membership...|$|R
40|$|Unique events often {{give rise}} to other unique events. Such {{was the case of}} Hurricane Katrina—the costliest and most {{destructive}} natural disaster in U. S. history. The resulting casualties and staggering dam-age estimates from the savage storm in late August 2005, led the U. S. Senate to vote overwhelmingly (92 to 6) against a Senate pay raise. Most senators apparently felt that voters would not look kindly on a Senate pay raise given the devastation caused by Katrina. The Senate vote was largely symbolic because the House of Rep-resentatives was not going to take a vote on rescinding a pay raise for members of Congress. Thus, senators voting against the raise knew their votes would resonate well with voters but have no impact on the annual congressional pay raise sanctioned by law. Of the six senators who did vote for the pay raise, five—James Jeffords (I-Vt.), Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), Jeff Bingaman (D-N. M.), Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), and Kit Bond (R-Mo.) —were long-time incumbents whose seats were not threatened, and one—Paul Sarbanes (D-Md.) —was about to retire. Typically, votes cast by members of Congress are relatively easy to predict. The empirical analysis of congressional voting patterns sug-gests that measures of ideology and party affiliation play a decisive role in explaining overall voting behavior. A vote on congressional pay, however, is not typical. It creates a dilemma for lawmakers by pitting two margins of self-interest against each other: <b>pecuniary</b> <b>gains</b> and reelection.

30|$|As {{the pilgrims}} were plundered {{outside of the}} shrines by the Wagher tribe, within they were {{exploited}} by another clan of avaricious Brahmin priests known as ‘Gugli’. Taking folklore into account, Gugli Brahmins can be assumed to be the officiating priests at the Dwarka temple {{for more than a}} millennium. 16 History suggests that their treatment of priestcraft was not as a service, but as a profession for <b>pecuniary</b> <b>gains.</b> The legend of Dakor symbolises the extent of their rapacity. Given the erstwhile political instability, the corruption of Gugli Brahmins was at the nadir in the history. Any holy act on the holy land of Dwarka or adjacent Sankhodwar (Bet Dwarka) was unimaginable without tipping their coffers. They exacted money for all rituals and sacraments including bathing in the River Gomti, performing rites for the deceased, and taking the imprint of holy seals. As per the tradition, one was not allowed to enter the Dwarkadheesh (Krishna) temple without taking the imprint of holy seals on one’s biceps. For the imprint received at Arambhada (a site near the Dwarkadheesh temple), notes political agent James Macmurdo during a visit sometime around c. 1809 CE, ‘the tax per stamp is five cories, 17 four of which goes to the Government of Aramra (Arambhada) and one to the Brahman who gives it’ (Macmurdo 1977, 49). According to erstwhile conversion, four cories equals one rupee (Vaghela 2011, 33). In relative terms, comparing to an individual’s earning, a camel man earned five rupees as a monthly wage during 1814 CE which slightly increased to seven rupees during 1828 CE (Martin 1839, 368).|$|R

This paper applies Veblen’s institutional and evolutionary concepts to international development institutions and proposes that these institutions should be abolished because they have become, “an obstruction to industry and a means for impoverishment. ...|$|R

Government expenditures may be efficient if either effect {{is larger than the}} public sector contribution. ^ A minor league stadium building boom provides an interesting context in which to conduct economic policy research. Based on the unsupported claims of major league teams, minor league baseball team owners also maintain ex ante that new ballparks will increase employment, tax revenues, and other private economic development. Yet, no research has substantiated or refuted these assertions at the minor league level. ^ This dissertation performed two analyses to remedy this gap in the literature. The first measures <b>pecuniary</b> <b>gains</b> using a dynamic panel data model and finds that AAA teams, A+ teams, AA stadiums, and rookie stadiums are all associated with significant gains in local per capita income. The presence of positive effects is strikingly different from decades of non-positive results at the major league level. ^ The second analysis measures non-pecuniary benefits via a hedonic rent equation to determine whether a team is a valuable amenity that increases local quality of life. Affiliated teams are associated with significant increases in rents whereas independent teams are associated with significant decreases in rent. ^ Collectively, the pecuniary and non-pecuniary benefits derived from minor league baseball are in excess of the stadium subsidy in markets with AAA teams and rookie stadiums. Only cities with independent teams suffer a loss from the presence of a team. In a more conservative case, actual dollar gains in income tax revenues are sufficient to cover the stadium cost in only 25 % of AAA markets and 75 % of rookie markets. ^ This research helps inform the current policy debate on public funding for minor league stadiums by evaluating the veracity of claims made by stadium proponents. With hundreds of millions of public dollars spent each year on minor league baseball stadiums, the economic effects of teams on communities have important policy implications. ...|$|R
