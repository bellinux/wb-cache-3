In order to overcome the 'language barrier', documentation systems use thesaurized coded information or graphics such as patent drawings or chemical formulas, which are free from any language barrier. As most data bases allowing online dialog searching are based on English texts, users not speaking English as their mother tongue may be at a loss. The authors propose to establish free-text searchable data bases enabling the searcher to use his German mother tongue, in addition to graphical information to be presented on the screen. ...|$|R

40|$|At the European Patent Office (EPO) a {{comprehensive}} data file called PRI is maintained of patent families. The file records {{are based on}} <b>published</b> <b>patent</b> <b>documents,</b> indexed by the priority number of the first patent filing, with information on subsequent patenting activities for that invention in the four major economic blocs: EPC contracting states, Japan, USA and Others. It is possible to filter the data in order to highlight the most important inventions, for example by selecting Trilateral patent families that lead to patenting activity in EPC contracting states (including EPO), Japan and USA. The relationship between patent families and subsequent filings is not one-to-one. In order to compare calculated figures from the EPO data set with an alternative system of consolidated families, {{it is suggested that}} bounds may be calculable for numbers of consolidated families by taking account of the overall numbers of network links between priority forming first filings and subsequent filings. The key to this methodology is the identification of all the links between first filings and subsequent filings in a family. There is a timeliness problem caused by a considerable delay between the date of first filing and the appearance of a publication that can index a patent family. A method is described by which more up-to-date counts of families (numbers of priorities) can be made by augmenting the database with information that is available in the distinct filings databases at the patent offices. The families data set can be used to investigate the patenting behaviour by individual companies, industries, countries or economic blocs, or to study changing patterns of technology in world-wide industrial research. Some representative data are presented over a series of years that show increasing trends for the numbers of world-wide first filings, for numbers of filings flowing from one country to another, for numbers of patent families making use of the PCT system, and for the numbers of families within the EPC contracting states area that make use of the EPO. Good forecasts for numbers of patent filings at the EPO are needed for the purpose of internal resource requirements planning. An initial attempt is described to set up an econometric model for the development of subsequent filings at the EPO, based on patent families information and on concomitant variables including source country R&D stock per worker and source country GDP per capita. It may eventually be possible to generalise a successful model of this type in order to predict filings flows to and from all the major patent offices. ...|$|R
40|$|The Chinese <b>Patent</b> Office <b>published</b> {{its first}} issue of the Official Gazette of Patents and {{pamphlets}} of applications on 10 September 1985. Adding the new contents in the Chinese <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> to the treasure house of world patent information will benefit China {{and the rest of}} the world as well. Some explanations on the newly <b>published</b> Chinese <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> are briefly introduced in the article. After the entering into force of the Chinese Patent Law on 1 April 1985, expectation from both domestic enthusiasts and friends abroad has been centering on such questions as: Can the Chinese Patent Law run smoothly? When will the Chinese Patent Office have their <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> <b>published?</b> What sort of information will be disclosed in the first batch of publications? Some answers to these doubts were provided at a news conference held by the Chinese Patent Office on 10 September 1985. On that day, the Chinese <b>Patent</b> Office <b>published</b> its {{first issue of}} Official Gazette of Patents for Inventions (Fig. 1), Official Gazette of Patents for Utility Models (Fig. 2) and Official Gazette of Patents for Designs (Fig. 3) annoucing the decision to publish the first batch of its applications for patents for inventions examined by the Patent Office in conformity with the prescriptions of Article 39 of the Patent Law, and the first batch of its applications for patents for utility models and designs after preliminary examination in conformity with the prescriptions of Article 40 of the Patent Law. On that day, the Chinese Patent Office did simultaneously publish the unesamined applications for inventions, the examined applications for patents for inventions and the applications for patents for utility models. It is an important step for the Chinese <b>Patent</b> Office to <b>publish</b> the applications for patents before patents are granted and to let anyone have the chance to file an opposition to them, in order that the quality of examination and granting of patents may be assured. In fact, the Chinese Patent Office describes the opposition procedure as a good way to combine the examination of patents by professionals and by the public. If no oppositions are filed in conformity with the Law, patent right shall be granted to all these announced applications for patents. Up to the end of September 1985, the Chinese Patent Office had all together received 10 751 applications for patents, of which 6602 are applications for patents for inventions taking 61. 4 % of the total, 3686 are applications for patents for utility models, taking 34. 3 % of the total, and 463 are applications for patents for designs, taking 4. 3 % of the total. Of the total number of applications for patents, 7138 are filed by Chinese nationals, taking 66. 4 % of the whole number, and 3613 are filed by foreigners, taking 33. 6 % of the whole number. The publication of <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> signifies that China has taken a substantive step forward in the implementation of the Patent Law. From that day on, China began to have its own <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> which will form a complete set of informative and publicly available technical files, and searching was dependent on the text alone for selection. This difference alone may account for much of the difference in the outcomes. This issue will be analyzed more fully when the USPTO conducts more comprehensive analyses in the course of the evaluation of its Automated Patent System. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Patent</b> <b>documents</b> are {{important}} intellectual resources of protecting interests of individuals, organizations and companies. These <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> have great research values, {{beneficial to the}} industry, business, law, and policy-making communities. Patent mining aims at assisting patent analysts in investigating, processing, and analyzing <b>patent</b> <b>documents,</b> which has attracted increasing interest in academia and industry. However, despite recent advances in patent mining, several critical issues in current patent mining systems have not been well explored in previous studies. These issues include: 1) the query retrieval problem that assists patent analysts finding all relevant <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> for a given patent application; 2) the <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> comparative summarization problem that facilitates patent analysts in quickly reviewing any given <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> pairs; and 3) the key <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> discovery problem that helps patent analysts to quickly grasp the linkage between different technologies {{in order to better}} understand the technical trend from a collection of <b>patent</b> <b>documents.</b> This dissertation follows the stream of research that covers the aforementioned issues of existing patent analysis and mining systems. In this work, we delve into three interleaved aspects of patent mining techniques, including (1) PatSearch, a framework of automatically generating the search query from a given patent application and retrieving relevant patents to user; (2) PatCom, a framework for investigating the relationship in terms of commonality and difference between <b>patent</b> <b>documents</b> pairs, and (3) PatDom, a framework for integrating multiple types of patent information to identify important patents from a large volume of <b>patent</b> <b>documents.</b> In summary, the increasing amount and textual complexity of patent repository lead to a series of challenges that are not well addressed in the current generation systems. My work proposed reasonable solutions to these challenges and provided insights on how to address these challenges using a simple yet effective integrated patent mining framework...|$|R
