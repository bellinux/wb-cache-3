5|$|According to the Azores High hypothesis, an anti-phase {{pattern is}} {{expected}} to exist between the Gulf of Mexico coast and the Atlantic coast. During the quiescent periods, a more northeasterly position of the Azores High would result in more hurricanes being steered towards the Atlantic coast. During the hyperactive period, more hurricanes were steered towards the Gulf coast as the Azores High was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the Caribbean. Such a displacement of the Azores High is consistent with paleoclimatic evidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in Haiti around 3200 14C years BP, and a change towards more humid conditions in the Great Plains during the late-Holocene as more moisture was <b>pumped</b> <b>up</b> the Mississippi Valley through the Gulf coast. Preliminary data from the northern Atlantic coast seem to support the Azores High hypothesis. A 3000-year proxy record from a coastal lake in Cape Cod suggests that hurricane activity increased significantly during the past 500–1000 years, just as the Gulf coast was amid a quiescent period of the last millennium.|$|E

25|$|He saw the sea as {{a remnant}} {{of the mass of}} {{humidity}} that once surrounded Earth. A part of that mass evaporated under the sun's action, thus causing the winds and even the rotation of the celestial bodies, which he believed were attracted to places where water is more abundant. He explained rain as a product of the humidity <b>pumped</b> <b>up</b> from Earth by the sun. For him, the Earth was slowly drying up and water only remained in the deepest regions, which someday would go dry as well. According to Aristotle's Meteorology (II, 3), Democritus also shared this opinion.|$|E
25|$|In 1885, the Nashville Americans {{minor league}} {{baseball}} team became charter members of the newly formed Southern League. Athletic Park, which had hitherto been little more that solely a baseball field, required improvements to make it suitable for professional teams. A 150-foot (46 m) wooden grandstand was built {{at the corner of}} modern-day Fourth Avenue North and Jackson Street. The main Jackson Street entrance led past the ticket booth and into the grandstand's reserved seats behind home plate and a screen backstop. Rooms for players, directors, scorers, and reporters were built under the grandstand. Two of them had views of the field, which were protected by wire screens. Restrooms and water fountains, which <b>pumped</b> <b>up</b> sulphur water from the springs below, were also built. The distance to the outfield fence was 362feet (110m) to left and right fields and 485feet (148m) to center.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to managing gas extraction, KivuWatt will also manage the electrical generation plants and on-sell the electrical {{power to the}} Rwandan government {{under the terms of}} a long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). This allows KivuWatt to control a vertically integrated energy offering from point of extraction to point of sale into the local grid. Extraction is said to be cost-effective and relatively simple because once the gas-rich water is <b>pumped</b> <b>up,</b> the dissolved gases (primarily carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulphide and methane) begin to bubble out as the water pressure gets lower. This project is expected to increase Rwanda's energy generation capability by as much as 20 times, and will enable Rwanda to sell electricity to neighbouring African countries. The firm was awarded the 2011 Africa Power deal of the year for innovation in the financing arrangements it obtained from various sources for the KivuWatt project. The $200 million power plant was operating at 26 MW in 2016.|$|E
25|$|Several {{of these}} rivers have been dammed to create {{reservoirs}} to provide drinking {{water for the}} residents of Dublin and its environs. The first of these was the River Vartry, dammed to create the Vartry Reservoir near Roundwood in the 1860s. A second dam was added in 1924 to increase capacity. The River Dodder feeds the two Bohernabreena reservoirs in the northern foothills of the Wicklow Mountains at Glenasmole in County Dublin, which were constructed between 1883 and 1887 to supply water to the townland of Rathmines. The Poulaphouca Reservoir, on the River Liffey near Blessington, was constructed between 1938 and 1940. There are also two hydroelectricity plants at Poulaphouca, constructed during the 1940s. A pumped storage hydroelectricity plant was constructed at Turlough Hill between 1968 and 1974. Water is <b>pumped</b> <b>up</b> from Lough Nanahangan, a natural corrie lake, into an artificial reservoir on Tomaneena mountain and released at times of peak electricity demand.|$|E
25|$|The soft spile in the shive allows gas to vent off. This {{can be seen}} by {{the bubbles}} foaming around the spile. The {{landlord}} will periodically check the bubbles by wiping the spile clean and then watching to see how fast the bubbles reform. There still has to be some life in the beer otherwise it will taste flat. When the beer is judged to be ready, the landlord will replace the soft spile with a hard one (which doesn't allow air in or gas out) and let the beer settle for 24 hours. They will also knock a tap into the end of the cask. This might simply be a tap if the cask is stored behind the bar. The beer will then be served simply under gravity pressure: turn on the tap, and the beer comes out. But if the cask is in the cellar, the beer needs to travel via tubes, or beer lines, and be <b>pumped</b> <b>up</b> to the bar area, normally using a handpump also known as a 'beer engine'.|$|E
