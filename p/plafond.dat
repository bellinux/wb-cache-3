25|$|At {{an early}} stage of the {{conversion}} in the 1690s, a number of elderly Swedish artists such as David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl and Johan Sylvius, were still alive and they contributed with artistic work to the completion of the northern row, in particular to the Royal Chapel. Ehrenstrahl made the large religious paintings and Sylvius painted the <b>plafond.</b>|$|E
25|$|Little {{is known}} of Brenna's private life or even his {{personal}} appearance. The sole existing portrait of Brenna as a middle-aged man bears certain resemblance to images of Paul I, perhaps a deliberate flattery. Another idealistic image of Brenna was painted in the <b>plafond</b> of Saint Michael's Castle by a mediocre assistant who used the same model for cupids and statesmen.|$|E

At the complex, {{there is}} a mosque called Khakim Kushbegi, with the flat trabeation, {{supported}} by the two columns and forming six painted <b>plafonds.</b> To the south adjoins ayvan with five columns and {{the same number of}} painted <b>plafonds.</b> To the north is another ayvan, also with five wooden columns, beam ceiling and vassa.|$|R

25|$|The {{ceiling in}} the {{antechamber}} located {{next to the}} bedroom-study is adorned with the Bishop Zadzik family crests (Korab, Jelita, Dołęga, Rola), the central painting of the <b>plafond</b> depicts the parliamentary scene The Judgment of the Arians in 1638 with portraits of king Władysław IV, bishop Zadzik, other dignitaries {{and a group of}} dissenters. The background scene is a vast landscape of a town with a church (Raków?) and the departure of the Arians (Polish Brethren), members of the Polish Protestant church, who taught the equality and brotherhood of all people. In the corners are visible personifications of the seasons. Just like in the next room, the walls vere covered with a green-golden fabric, the marble portal and floor were recreated.|$|E
25|$|The bishops {{apartment}} {{consisted of}} two antechambers, bedroom-study and a study. The antechamber adjacent {{to the dining room}} area was once decorated with a <b>plafond</b> depicting the scene of the 1634 treaty ending the Polish-Muscovite War (Treaty of Stuhmsdorf), while its walls were covered with a gilded cordovan. Among the elements of the original furnishing the most important are black marble fireplace topped with the Korab coat of arms and the remnants of marble floor. The framework Venetian ceilings, patterned after such in the Palazzo Ducale, appeared in Poland in the early 17th century initially in the interiors of royal residences (Wawel Castle). Such decoration soon become the main feature of the representative chambers of the noble residencies, town halls and even merchant houses. Among a dozen ceilings documented in sources only two preserved - in Gdańsk and Kielce.|$|E
500|$|A {{common factor}} {{affecting}} {{the flavors of}} Bordeaux wines is the harvest yields of Cabernet Sauvignon. Throughout Bordeaux there is a legal maximum permitted yield of 50 hectoliters (hl) per hectare (ha). With the aid of global warming and vigorous rootstocks, many Bordeaux vineyards can easily surpass 60 hl/ha, with some estates {{taking advantage of the}} legal loophole of <b>plafond</b> limite de classement ("ceiling limit classification") that permits higher yields during [...] "exceptional" [...] years. This has had an adverse effect on the quality of production from some producers who regularly use grapes harvested at excessive yields. In recent years there has been more of an emphasis on keeping yields low, particularly for an estate's Grand vin.|$|E
50|$|The {{conservation}} and {{enlargement of the}} former residence of Victorious King, John III Sobieski, is considered as her most significant achievement {{in the field of}} architecture. She embellished the palace facades and garden parterres with her coat of arms Szreniawa and monograms. For the decoration of the palace's interiors she nominated an Italian fresco painter Giuseppe Rossi, who adorned the chambers with trompe-l'œil paintings and mythological <b>plafonds.</b> By taking the example of Queen Marie Casimire, that ordered to paint her as a goddess in palace <b>plafonds,</b> the hetmaness decorated the Lower Vestibule with a fresco depicting her as a Roman goddess of fertility - Flora (she was almost 60 at that time).|$|R
5000|$|The castle {{has three}} levels except the {{basement}} and four wings with towers. Several of the rooms contain <b>plafonds</b> by David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl. The south west wing contain a chapel. A fountain by Fredrik Wilhelm Scholander is placed outside the southern wall.|$|R
50|$|As a {{decorative}} feature of churches and staterooms, <b>plafonds</b> were popular from the 17th century until {{the beginning of}} the 19th century. Designs of this period typically used the illusion of a break in the ceiling showing the architectural structure behind, strongly foreshortened figures, architectural details and/or the open sky.|$|R

2500|$|The palace complex {{consisted}} of a small, almost square, -storey-high main palace with dome and lanterns. [...] It is positioned exactly at the centre {{of what is known}} as a [...] "hunting star" [...] (Danish, jagtstjerne), a number of straight intersecting paths in a game hunting reserve. [...] During a hunt it was permissible to shoot freely straight down the long paths, which radiated out from the centre. [...] The dome hall measured 15 x 15 m, and had a height of 27 m. [...] The sumptuous room featured stucco by C.E. Brenno and a <b>plafond</b> by Hendrick Krock.|$|E
2500|$|Like most French wine regions, {{viticulture}} in the Cote de Nuits is {{dictated by}} tradition and AOC regulations. This {{can be seen}} in the high density planting of 4,000 vines per acre (10,000 vines per ha). This in contrast to other pinot noir producing regions, such as Oregon and the Russian River Valley in Sonoma that rarely have vine density exceed 2,000 vines per acre. Most of the vines are trained under the Guyot system, though there has been some experimentation with the Cordon de Royat system to help temper the vigor of some over productive rootstock. The close plantings and tradition usually mandates manual harvesting of the grapes, especially for the premier and grand cru vineyards. Under AOC regulations, harvest yields for pinot noir are limited to 40 hl/ha (2.3 tons per acre) for premier cru and village level wines and 35 hl/ha for grand cru. However, in what are deemed to be [...] "exceptional years" [...] that warrant larger harvests, growers can seek an exception to the yield maximum with an official <b>plafond</b> limite de classement or PLC from AOC authorities that will allow a 20-30% increase in maximum yields for the year.|$|E
5000|$|Numerous {{works were}} {{lost to the}} fires at Christiansborg in 1794 and at Frederiksborg in 1859, {{including}} his famous [...] "Dommedag" [...] ("Judgement Day"). Work extant can still be seen on <b>plafonds</b> at Fredensborg and Frederiksberg. Due to the volume of work he produced he maintained a studio with many students and apprentices.|$|R
50|$|He {{returned}} to Denmark again in 1705, and painted over {{the remainder of}} his working life many <b>plafonds,</b> wall panels, door pieces and mythological paintings as decoration for such royal palaces and castles as Frederiksberg, Fredensborg, Hirschholm, Rosenborg, and Christiansborg, as well as for various churches. These works were generally large, and with many figures.|$|R
50|$|He studied {{art at the}} Accademia di San Luca. During the Revolutions of 1848, he left Italy. In 1850, {{he settled}} in Saint Petersburg and {{initially}} worked as a decorative painter for churches and palaces; creating everything from small door decorations to <b>plafonds.</b> Later he began to do portraits; mostly of women and children, in oils and colored pencils.|$|R
60|$|Of this revolution, Monsieur Ingres {{has been}} one of the chief instruments. He was, before Horace Vernet, {{president}} of the French Academy at Rome, and is famous as a chief of a school. When he broke up his atelier here, to set out for his presidency, many of his pupils attended him faithfully some way on his journey; and some, with scarcely a penny in their pouches, walked through France and across the Alps, in a pious pilgrimage to Rome, being determined not to forsake their old master. Such an action was worthy of them, and of the high rank which their profession holds in France, where the honors to be acquired by art are only inferior to those which are gained in war. One reads of such peregrinations in old days, when the scholars of some great Italian painter followed him from Venice to Rome, or from Florence to Ferrara. In regard of Ingres's individual merit as a painter, the writer of this is not a fair judge, having seen but three pictures by him; one being a <b>plafond</b> in the Louvre, which his disciples much admire.|$|E

5000|$|For centuries, Lille, {{a city of}} merchants, has {{displayed}} {{a wide range of}} incomes: great wealth and poverty have lived side by side, especially {{until the end of the}} 1800s. This contrast was noted by Victor Hugo in 1851 in his poem Les Châtiments: « Caves de Lille ! on meurt sous vos <b>plafonds</b> de pierre ! » ("Cellars of Lille! We die under your stone ceilings!") ...|$|R
50|$|In the {{contract}} with King Augustus II Maria Zofia obliged him to preserve the palace unchanged. Therefore, his actions were limited to finishing the new dining room, called the White Room in the southern wing and to the decoration of some unfinished interiors. The <b>plafonds</b> and other paintings were executed by Julien Poison, Johann Samuel Mock and Lorenzo Rossi, while the decorative lacquer panneaux in the Chinese Room were made by Martin Schnell.|$|R

50|$|<b>Plafond</b> over de vloer is a Dutch {{television}} show in nine episodes, aired in 1986 by the VPRO and {{written and directed}} by Wim T. Schippers. It derives from the radio show Ronflonflon, and its main character is that show's host, Jacques <b>Plafond.</b>|$|E
50|$|Jacques <b>Plafond,</b> {{besides being}} the show's host, was {{featured}} in many of Schippers' television shows and other productions, such as Opzoek naar Yolanda (1984, scheduled to run concurrently with Ronflonflon) and <b>Plafond</b> over de vloer (1986, a television show based on the radio show).|$|E

50|$|Pushkinskaya (Пушкинская) is {{a station}} on Moscow Metro's Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya Line. Opened on 17 December 1975, along with Kuznetsky Most as the segment which linked the Zhdanovskaya and Krasnopresnenskaya Lines into one. Like its neighbour, {{the station was}} a column tri-vault type, which had not been seen in Moscow since the 1950s. Arguably the most {{beautiful}} station on the Line, the architects Vdovin and Bazhenov took every effort {{to make it appear}} to have a 'classical' 19th century setting. The central hall lighting is created with stylised 19th century chandeliers with two rows of <b>plafonds</b> appearing like candles, while the side platforms have candlesticks with similar <b>plafonds.</b> The columns, covered with 'Koelga' white marble are decorated with palm leaf reliefs and the grey marble walls are decorated with brass measured insertions based on the works of the great Russian poet Alexander Pushkin. The grey granite floor completes the appearance of the masterpiece. Architecturally the station put the final stop to the functionality economy design of the 1960s and went against Nikita Khrushchev's policy of struggle to avoid decorative 'extras', which left the stations of 1958-59 greatly altered in their design.|$|R
5000|$|Stucco decorations of the interior, {{mainly on}} {{overhead}} vaults, belong to Giovanni Battista Falconi of Milan who {{spent most of}} his adult life working in Poland. In the apse of the presbytery, there are also his scenes from {{the life and death of}} Saints Peter and Paul, and the statues of patrons of Poland - Saint Wojciech and Saint Stanisława. In the aisles, his artwork becomes much more joyous and include figures of angelic putti woven into ornamental compositions and <b>plafonds.</b>|$|R
