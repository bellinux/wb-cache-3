5|$|While {{thinner than}} its {{predecessor}} – the iBook G4 – the MacBook is wider than the 12-inch model due to its widescreen display. In addition, the MacBook {{was one of the}} first (the first being the MacBook Pro) to adopt Apple's MagSafe <b>power</b> <b>connector</b> and it replaced the iBook's mini-VGA display port with a mini-DVI display port. The iBook's discrete graphics chip was initially replaced by an integrated Intel GMA solution, though the latest revisions of the MacBook were upgraded with the more powerful Nvidia GeForce 9400M and later the 320M.|$|E

50|$|<b>Power</b> <b>connectors</b> {{must protect}} people from {{accidental}} contact with energized conductors. <b>Power</b> <b>connectors</b> often include a safety ground connection {{as well as}} the power conductors. In larger sizes, these connectors must also safely contain any arc produced when an energized circuit is disconnected or may require interlocking to prevent opening a live circuit.|$|R

25|$|Serial Attached SCSI (SAS). The SAS {{is a new}} {{generation}} serial communication protocol for devices designed to allow for much higher speed data transfers and is compatible with SATA. SAS uses a mechanically identical data and <b>power</b> <b>connector</b> to standard 3.5-inch SATA1/SATA2 HDDs, and many server-oriented SAS RAID controllers are also capable of addressing SATA HDDs. SAS uses serial communication instead of the parallel method found in traditional SCSI devices but still uses SCSI commands.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} 15-inch MacBook Pro {{was announced}} on January 10, 2006 by Steve Jobs at the Macworld Conference & Expo. The 17-inch model was unveiled on April 24, 2006. The first design {{was largely a}} carryover from the PowerBook G4, but uses Intel Core CPUs instead of PowerPC G4 chips. The 15-inch MacBook Pro weighs {{the same as the}} 15-inch aluminum PowerBook G4, but is [...] deeper, [...] wider, and [...] thinner. Other changes from the PowerBook include a built-in iSight webcam and the inclusion of MagSafe, a magnetic <b>power</b> <b>connector</b> designed to detach easily when yanked. These features were later brought over to the MacBook. The optical drive was reduced in size in order to fit into the slimmer MacBook Pro, hence it runs slower than the optical drive in the PowerBook G4 and cannot write to dual layer DVDs.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{styles of}} <b>power</b> <b>connectors</b> exist, not {{included}} in the NEMA standard. For example, a [...] "California Standard" [...] for 50Amp applications was used for motion picture production, and has found uses in marine, data center, and recreational vehicle applications.

2500|$|Five-Pin XLR is also {{a common}} <b>power</b> <b>connector</b> in modular {{professional}} audio systems, such as the Automated Processes, Inc.'s (API) Lunchbox format.

It is also used by Slate Digital for the VMS1 microphone preamp. Typically the pin configuration is: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} {{signal flow}} for audio in XLR connectors {{is that the}} output is a male connector and the input is female. In other words, the pins on the plug point {{in the direction of}} signal flow. This is the opposite of <b>power</b> <b>connector</b> standards which normally use female connectors for outputs, a convention influenced by the need to prevent accidental contact with dangerous voltages. However, the voltages of microphone and line level audio signals are not hazardous. The male XLR is usually [...] incorporated in the body of a microphone.|$|E
