40|$|The use of <b>pesticides</b> {{in modern}} {{agriculture}} is unavoidable {{because they are}} required to control weeds. <b>Pesticides</b> are poisonous; hence, they are dangerous if misused. Understanding the fate of <b>pesticides</b> will be useful to use them safely. Therefore, contaminations of water and soil resources could be avoided. The fates of <b>pesticides</b> in soils are influenced by their sorption, decomposition and movement. Degradation and leaching of <b>pesticides</b> are control by sorption. Soil organic matter and clay content are main soil constituents that have a high capacity for sorption of <b>pesticides.</b> Addition of organic maters to amend the soils is a usual practice that every year has been done in a huge area of worldwide.   The added organic amendments to the soils affect the fate of <b>pesticides</b> in soils as well. <b>Pesticides</b> fates in different soils are different. The addition of organic matter to soils causes different fates for <b>pesticides</b> as well. It is known from the studies that sorption of non-ionic <b>pesticides</b> by soil in aqueous system is controlled mainly by the organic matter content of the soils. Sorption of <b>pesticides</b> has been reported to increase by amending soils with organic matter. In general, conditions that promote microbial activity enhance the rate of <b>pesticides</b> degradation, and those that inhibit the growth of microorganisms reduce the rate of degradation. Amendment of soils with organic matter may modify leaching of <b>pesticides</b> in soil. Some studies showed that organic matter added to soils reduced <b>pesticides</b> in ground water.

5|$|Bumblebee {{species are}} declining in Europe, North America, and Asia {{due to a}} number of factors, {{including}} land-use change that reduces their food plants. In North America, pathogens are possibly having a stronger negative effect especially for the subgenus Bombus. A major impact on bumblebees was caused by the mechanisation of agriculture, accelerated by the urgent need to increase food production during the Second World War. Small farms depended on horses to pull implements and carts. The horses were fed on clover and hay, both of which were permanently grown on a typical farm. Little artificial fertiliser was used. Farms thus provided flowering clover and flower-rich meadows, favouring bumblebees. Mechanisation removed the need for horses and most of the clover; artificial fertilisers encouraged the growth of taller grasses, outcompeting the meadow flowers. Most of the flowers, and the bumblebees that fed on them, disappeared from Britain by the early 1980s. The last native British short-haired bumblebee was captured near Dungeness in 1988. This significant increase in <b>pesticide</b> and fertilizer use associated with the industrialization of agriculture has had adverse effects on the Bombus genus. The bees are directly exposed to the chemicals in two ways: by consuming nectar that has been directly treated with <b>pesticide,</b> or through physical contact with treated plants and flowers. The species Bombus hortorum in particular {{has been found to be}} impacted by the pesticides; their brood development has been reduced and their memory has been negatively affected. Additionally, <b>pesticide</b> use negatively impacts colony development and size.|$|E
30|$|The {{frequent}} {{high concentrations}} (over guideline values) of <b>pesticides</b> {{detected in the}} current study are probably due to the extensive utilization of <b>pesticides</b> in the agricultural fields. There are three major sources for surface water contamination by pesticides: inappropriate handling of <b>pesticides</b> (e.g., washing equipment in the river), volatilization to air, and residuals from soil and water. In this perspective, the drainage of water from agricultural fields into irrigation channels poses a critical source of risk for contamination by <b>pesticides</b> in the broader water environment (Phong et al. 2010). Rain runoff from agricultural fields that occurred immediately after the application period of <b>pesticides</b> has been pointed to be the major source of <b>pesticides</b> in water bodies (Kreuger 1998). Rainfall, and hence the associated increased runoff, would be expected to result in increased movement of <b>pesticides</b> into nearby water bodies. However, the persistent nature of the <b>pesticides</b> is of great concern due to their bioaccumulative nature and toxic biological effects on wildlife and humans (Tanabe et al. 2000).|$|R
