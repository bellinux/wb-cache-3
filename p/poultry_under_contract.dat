40|$|The use of {{agricultural}} contracts between farmers and processors or other buyers has increased substantially in recent years. Roughly {{half of all}} U. S. fruit and vegetable production is <b>under</b> <b>contract.</b> Contract usage varies widely across agricultural products. For example, 95 % of <b>poultry</b> is raised <b>under</b> <b>contract</b> while only 13 % of corn is. The wine grape industry utilizes contracts, yet {{little is known about}} the extent of contract use, or the use of specific terms and objectives. We used a survey to analyze contract use among wine grape producers, determine which users are utilizing contracts, and identify how they differ from nonusers. Ninety percent of the growers who responded to the survey have contracts, the majority of which were multiyear, averaging 3. 7 years. Growers with more experience, larger vineyards, more expensive grapes and longer relationships with the buyer were more likely to enter into contracts...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. poultry {{industry}} {{is the fastest}} growing sector within the meat complex. Concentration and efficiency of U. S. poultry production have grown steadily since the mid- 1930 s. Poultry is the most vertically integrated of the meat industries and vertical coordination, the linking together of successive stages of production and marketing through ownership or contracting, has spread rapidly, allowing poultry producers to maintain lower per-unit production costs and higher profits relative to those in other meat industries. Virtually all commercial <b>poultry</b> is grown <b>under</b> <b>contract</b> or by integrated firms. Due to the vertical integration, production decisions, from the hatchery supply flock through final production, are made by vertically coordinated management. This allows {{for the analysis of}} poultry production as part of a single production process, unlike beef and pork production. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in South Eastern Nigeria using Anambra State as a case study. Eight Local Government Areas (LGAs) were purposively drawn from the study area from which 64 farmers <b>under</b> <b>contract</b> farming were drawn. Also 64 farmers that were not <b>under</b> <b>contract</b> farming were drawn across the LGAs. Staff from Agricultural Development Programme (ADP) and Nigeria Starch Mills, Ihiala, Anambra State assisted in data collected. Data were collected using structured questionnaires and interviews. Data collected were analyzed using frequency tables, means and percentages, Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and Chow’s test models. Results from the analyses show that farmers <b>under</b> <b>contract</b> farming had larger land areas of cultivation and relatively younger than farmers not <b>under</b> <b>contract</b> farming. The farmers <b>under</b> <b>contract</b> farming were more educated but had fewer years of farming experience than the farmers that were not <b>under</b> <b>contract</b> farming. Farm size, productivity, net returns, and welfare levels of the farmers <b>under</b> <b>contract</b> farming (5. 5 ha, N 1. 8, N 78520 and N 14630) were equally higher than those not <b>under</b> <b>contract</b> farming (1. 4 ha, N 1. 2, N 19300 and N 8900). Furthermore, the result shows that the significant factors that influenced the productivity of the farmers were age, educational status, farm size, farming experience and labour cost. The significant factors that influenced welfare of the farmers were education, total household income, land holding, years of farming experience an...|$|R
