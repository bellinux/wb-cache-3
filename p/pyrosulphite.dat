50|$|Sodium metabisulfite or sodium pyrosulfite (IUPAC spelling; Br. E. sodium {{metabisulphite}} or sodium <b>pyrosulphite)</b> is an inorganic compound of chemical formula Na2S2O5. The substance is {{sometimes referred to}} as disodium metabisulfite. It is used as a disinfectant, antioxidant and preservative agent.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{inhibitor}} of PPO, those competitive to oxygen in the copper site of the enzyme and those competitive to phenolics. Tentoxin has also been used in recent research to eliminate the PPO activity from seedlings of higher plants. Tropolone is a grape polyphenol oxidase inhibitor. Another inhibitor of this enzyme is potassium <b>pyrosulphite</b> (K2S2O5). Banana root PPO is strongly inhibited by dithiothreitol and sodium metabisulfite.|$|E
40|$|When heat {{activated}} Phycomyces blakesleeanus spores were incubated {{at room temperature}} a rapid and transient increase in cyclic AMP content was observed. A similar increase was observed during the heat treatment itself but the cyclic AMP content {{had returned to the}} value of dormant spores {{at the end of the}} 5 min treatment. The cyclic AMP content increased only after treatments at temperatures which also induced spore germination. A more gradual rise in cyclic AMP was also found during activation at room temperature with acetate and after activation of the spores with <b>pyrosulphite.</b> The increase in cyclic AMP content is the earliest event known to occur after activation of the spores. It clearly preceded the increase in trehalase activity observed during and/or after all the activating treatments, suggesting that, as shown for in vitro activation, the in vivo activation of trehalase is due to a cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation. An increase in cyclic AMP was a common feature of all activation methods investigated and appears to be the factor triggering spore germination...|$|E
