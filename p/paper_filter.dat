500|$|Clearmountain {{was said}} to {{have been one of the}} first {{recording}} engineers to hang tissue paper over the tweeters of the NS-10 to tame the over-bright treble. Covering the tweeters with tissue paper {{was said to}} produce treble-deficient mixes when replayed on normal domestic hi-fi. The phenomenon became the subject of hot debate. [...] Recording engineer Bob Hodas investigated the alleged sonic effects of tissue paper. He found inconsistent results with different paper, but said that tissue paper generally demonstrated an undesirable effect known as comb filtering, where the high frequencies are reflected back into the tweeter instead of being absorbed. [...] Hodas derided the tissue practice as [...] "aberrant behaviour", saying that engineers usually fear comb filtering and its associated cancellation effects. [...] He also suggested that more controllable and less random electronic filtering would be preferable. Newell et al. noted that had the speakers' grilles been used in studios, where they are routinely removed, they would have had the same effect on the treble output as the improvised tissue <b>paper</b> <b>filter.</b>|$|E

40|$|Aim of {{the study}} was to detect the {{possible}} loss of a. i. imidacloprid through the fan drain of pneumatic seed drills during corn sowing operations. The experiment regarded Gaucho ® dressed corn seeds. In order to detect air contamination, <b>paper</b> <b>filters</b> were positioned at the air output of the fan; in addition grass and flower samples from green areas near fields were collected immedi-ately after the corn had been sown. Residues of imidacloprid were found both in the <b>paper</b> <b>filters</b> and in the grass and flowers samples.

40|$|Measurement of {{soil suction}} is {{important}} as soil suction {{is one of}} the two stress-state variables that control both the hydro and mechanical behaviour of unsaturated soils. One of the soil suction measurement techniques is the <b>filter</b> <b>paper</b> method. Even though the <b>filter</b> <b>paper</b> technique has been standardized, the experimental procedure can still be improved {{in order to reduce the}} inconsistencies that are often reported with the <b>filter</b> <b>paper</b> technique. This paper explores usage of both initially dry and initially moist Whatman No. 42 <b>filter</b> <b>paper</b> for matric and total suction measurements. Residual soils from the Bukit Timah Granite in Singapore were compacted at various water contents from dry to wet of optimum using standard Proctor energies and their suctions were measured using both contact and non-contact <b>filter</b> <b>papers.</b> Results of the suction measurements showed hysteresis between the initially dry and the initially moist <b>filter</b> <b>papers</b> for both the contact and non-contact methods. Suction measurement by the contact <b>filter</b> <b>paper</b> method is more consistent than suction measurement by the non-contact <b>filter</b> <b>paper</b> method. Condensation causes the non-contact <b>filter</b> <b>papers</b> to have higher water contents. The results showed that the non-contact initially dry <b>filter</b> <b>paper</b> follows the total suction curve but the non-contact initially moist <b>filter</b> <b>paper</b> may follow the matric suction curve instead...|$|R

In addition, the response of half-PLBs or tTCLs to two antibiotics (kanamycin and cefotaxime, commonly used in plant genetic transformation studies) was investigated either directly on gelled medium or on filter paper-overlaid medium. <b>Filter</b> <b>paper</b> negatively affected most growth and developmental parameters of all the explants tested, both transgenic and non-transgenic. A double sheet of <b>filter</b> <b>paper</b> had a significantly (P ≤ 0. 05) more negative impact than a single sheet, relative to the control values (i. e., no <b>filter</b> <b>paper).</b> Kanamycin inhibited neo-PLB formation on TC medium, the negative impact being greater on a single layer than on a double layer of <b>filter</b> <b>paper,</b> i. e., <b>filter</b> <b>paper</b> buffered the growth-inhibiting characteristics of kanamycin.
