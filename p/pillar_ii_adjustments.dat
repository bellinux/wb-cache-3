40|$|In {{the lead}} up to the 10 th anniversary of the Responsibility to Protect (R 2 P) agreement, <b>pillar</b> <b>II</b> (which refers to {{international}} assistance with state consent) was heralded by the United Nations Special Advisor on R 2 P as the most promising aspect of the Responsibility to Protect. With so little written on <b>pillar</b> <b>II,</b> however, {{it is difficult to}} evaluate this judgement. Addressing this lacuna, this article scrutinizes the promise of <b>pillar</b> <b>II</b> to highlight two key strengths. First, the consensual support for <b>pillar</b> <b>II</b> among UN member states reveals that even those that were critical of the R 2 P in the aftermath of Libya in 2011 still favour the idea of international assistance. At the same time, there remain concerns over the use of force within <b>pillar</b> <b>II</b> as illustrated by events in Côte d'Ivoire in 2011. Second, the utility of <b>pillar</b> <b>II</b> lies in its potential for addressing the threat posed by non-state armed groups. This is particularly important when one considers that in thirteen of the fourteen years since 2000, rebel groups (rather than governments) have been the primary perpetrators of one-sided mass killing against civilians. Accordingly, <b>pillar</b> <b>II</b> can be seen to hold considerable promise for tackling the threat of mass violence by non-state armed groups in the twenty-first century. However, the article also raises concerns over unintentionally legitimizing illegitimate governments through assistance. To illustrate these points it draws on the assistance provided in Mali (2013 – 15) and Iraq (2014 – 15) ...|$|R

Many studies attempted {{to shed light on}} the topic by using various methods and data (mostly relying on geographically limited farm-level data). Depending on the model specification, statistical method and data source mixed results are reported. This study aims at estimating the impact of common agricultural policy <b>Pillar</b> <b>II</b> payments on agricultural productivity by using NUTS- 2 level data for the years 2007 - 2013 for the EU member state countries. We use a rather novel approach by simultaneously estimating a CES production function with productivity coefficients linked to the <b>Pillar</b> <b>II</b> payments. We use 4 categories of <b>Pillar</b> <b>II</b> payments (i. e. human capital, physical capital, agro-environmental and rural development) to explain the total factor productivity in agricultural sector.

On the other hand, payments related to rural development do not have significant impact on productivity.

40|$|The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} complex and also the most costly of all EU policies. It {{comprises}} over 40 financing streams, including Pillar I and <b>Pillar</b> <b>II</b> measures which are highly regulated. In the case of Poland, these are directed to all 16 NUTS 2 regions. We are modelling here the regional and thus national consequences of the CAP‚Äôs most costly <b>Pillar</b> <b>II</b> measure in Poland, so called Less Favoured Areas support (LFA). It is complex, when we recognise the multipurpose of this measure and significant amount of funds directed at a large number of regions. To handle the regional complexity of this problem, we require a multi-regional model. Such a model must be detailed in its disaggregation of industries, commodities and households if it is to be capable of reflecting the complexity of this measure. As such, we use a large-scale multi-regional CGE model. The model is tailored to reflect the complexity of the rural development policy (<b>Pillar</b> <b>II),</b> of which LFA is the largest part in Poland. Of the 82 region-specific sectors in the model, over 20 is related to agricultural production. The model distinguishes rural and urban households in each region and is based on the most recent IO tables of 2005. We propose a framework for mapping the individual financing stream of the LFA to the specific structural variables relating to specific type of land (LFA and nonLFA) in each region. As to our best knowledge such an approach was never conducted before with respect not only of LFA but also <b>Pillar</b> <b>II</b> measures in general...|$|R

40|$|In 2008, {{the world}} {{experienced}} a global financial crisis, highlighting concerns over a lighttouch financial regulatory system such as currently used in South Africa. Even though the South African financial system weathered the storm, {{nearly a million}} jobs were lost {{as a result of}} the global contagion that originated from the crisis in the First World s banking and financial systems. Consequently, the Financial Services Board, the South African regulator responsible for the non-banking financial services industry, started reforming its regulatory system in the aftermath. The Solvency Assessment and Management framework is currently being developed to establish a risk-based regime for the prudential regulation of long-term insurers and shortterm insurers in South Africa. Solvency Assessment and Management is developed as a risk-based supervision framework replicating the multi-year European project called Solvency II. The Financial Services Board established a Solvency Assessment and Management governance structure to provide it with recommendations from all stakeholders for the risk-based framework underlying the Solvency Assessment and Management regulatory regime. The Solvency Assessment and Management governance structure consists of three main committees overseeing quantitative aspects (Pillar I), risk management and governance (<b>Pillar</b> <b>II)</b> and reporting and disclosure (Pillar III). The study focused on the <b>Pillar</b> <b>II</b> impact of Solvency Assessment and Management on the role of risk management in an insurance company. Furthermore, the study evaluated the current self-assessed readiness of insurers for the future Solvency Assessment and Management risk management requirements. A quantitative data analysis approach was applied to the Solvency Assessment and Management <b>Pillar</b> <b>II</b> Readiness Survey, which the Financial Services Board conducted in 2012 as part of the journey to prepare insurers for Solvency Assessment and Management. The survey was mandatory for all registered South African insurance companies with the primary focus of gaining a better understanding of how insurers prepared themselves for the requirements of <b>Pillar</b> <b>II.</b> The questionnaire consisted of seven parts and in each part, there were specific questions related to the <b>Pillar</b> <b>II</b> requirements followed by a self-assessed readiness question. The purpose of the data analysis was to identify which aspects of the risk management section of the questionnaire were significant predictors of whether insurers rated themselves as ready for the Solvency Assessment and Management <b>Pillar</b> <b>II</b> risk management requirements. The relationship between the responses to each question and the insurer s self-assessed readiness for the Solvency Assessment and Management risk management requirements was tested using Pearson s chi-squared test and Fisher s exact test. Key predictors of readiness identified in the analysis were compared with literature on the attributes required for a robust risk management system. The study provided insight into insurers perception of a relevant risk management framework compliant with the Solvency Assessment and Management requirements. Results from the analysis of individual relationships for life insurers indicated that there was a significant relationship between having in place a risk management system documenting the risk management strategy, an explicit asset-liability management policy, an investment policy and a risk transfer policy and assessing themselves as ready for the Solvency Assessment and Management requirements. Therefore, life insurers who had these components of the risk management framework in place were more likely to assess themselves as ready for the future Solvency Assessment and Management <b>Pillar</b> <b>II</b> risk management requirements. For non-life insurers, the results indicated that there was a significant relationship between having in place a risk management system documenting the risk management strategy, an explicit asset-liability management policy, a risk transfer policy and a remuneration committee and assessing themselves as ready for the Solvency Assessment and Management requirements. Therefore, non-life insurers who had these components of the risk management framework in place were more likely to assess themselves as ready for the future Solvency Assessment and Management <b>Pillar</b> <b>II</b> risk management requirements.

Seemingly, the way funding has been allocated thus far, with a heavy focus on agriculture and directly related activities, is not appropriately suited to facilitate a holistic improvement of the state of rural areas of the EU, while it does not reflect the contemporary economic transition processes in these areas.
