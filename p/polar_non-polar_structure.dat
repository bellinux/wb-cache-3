Significant modification of the emission properties of MQWs grown over <b>non-polar</b> ELOG <b>structure</b> in comparison with non-polar orientation was observed.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether surface-associated compounds {{isolated from the}} macroalga Fucus vesiculosus {{had the potential to}} mediate microbial and/or macrobial epibiosis similar to that on the natural alga. To selectively yield thallus-associated compounds and avoid contamination by intracellular algal compounds, cell lysis was monitored by surface microscopy of algal cells and chemical profiling of algal surface extracts by coupled gas chromatography mass spectroscopy. The optimized extraction resulted in <b>polar</b> and <b>non-polar</b> algal surface extracts. The non-polar surface extract was immobilized in hydrogel, the polar surface extract was homogeneously perfused through the gel to ensure a temporally constant delivery of polar extract components. During a 7 day field trial, bacterial biofilms were formed on control gels and gels featuring <b>polar</b> and/or <b>non-polar</b> extract components. PERMANOVA revealed that bacterial community profiles on controls and on gels featuring <b>polar</b> or <b>non-polar</b> extract were significantly different from the profile on F. vesiculosus, while the profile on the gels bearing both <b>polar</b> and <b>non-polar</b> extracts was not. Moreover, the polar surface extracts inhibited the settlement of barnacle cyprids. Considering the pronounced effects of bacterial biofilms on invertebrate larval settlement, these results suggest that algal surface chemistry affects macrofouling not only directly but also indirectly, via its control of biofilm formation and compositio...|$|R

Exhaust emissions were generated using ULSD and biodiesel blended fuels and extracts of diesel PM (i. e., filters and PUFs) were separated into <b>polar</b> aromatic and <b>non-polar</b> neutral compounds. Mutagenic activity was assessed using the Salmonella mutagenicity assay, and Ah-receptor agonism was assessed using the DRCALUX assay. Results indicate that organic extracts of diesel/biodiesel particles contain direct- and indirect-acting polar aromatic mutagens as well as <b>polar</b> and <b>non-polar</b> Ah-receptor agonists. The mutagenicity of direct-acting compounds decreases with increasing concentrations of biodiesel in the fuel; however, there is no change in the indirect-acting mutagenicity. Furthermore, the ability of <b>polar</b> and <b>non-polar</b> compounds to induce the Ah-receptor increases with increasing concentrations of biodiesel in the fuel.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Transcriptional {{initiation}} and elongation provide {{control points}} in gene expression. Eukaryotic RNA polymerase II subunit 9 (RPB 9) regulates start-site selection and elongational arrest. RPB 9 contains Cys 4 Zn 2 +-binding motifs which are conserved in archaea and homologous {{to those of}} the general transcription factors TFIIB and TFIIS. Results: The structure of an RPB 9 domain from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus celer was determined at high resolution by NMR spectroscopy. The structure consists of an apical tetrahedral Zn 2 +-binding site, central β sheet and disordered loop. Although the structure lacks a globular hydrophobic core, the two surfaces of the β sheet each contain well ordered aromatic rings engaged in serial edge-to-face interactions. Basic sidechains are clustered near the Zn 2 +-binding site. The disordered loop contains sidechains conserved in TFIIS, including acidic residues essential for the stimulation of transcriptional elongation. Conclusions: The planar architecture of the RPB 9 zinc ribbon – distinct from that of a conventional globular domain – can accommodate significant differences in the alignment of <b>polar,</b> <b>non-polar</b> and charged sidechains. Such divergence is associated with local and non-local changes in structure. The RPB 9 structure is distinguished by a fourth β strand (extending the central β sheet) in a well ordered N-terminal segment and also differs from TFIIS (but not TFIIB) in the orientation of its apical Zn 2 +-binding site. Cys 4 Zn 2 +-binding sites with distinct patterns of <b>polar,</b> <b>non-polar</b> and charged residues are conserved among unrelated RNAP subunits and predicted to form variant zinc ribbons...|$|R
50|$|As {{proteins}} {{are made}} up of different sequences of amino acids, proteins can have various functions as its structural shape driven by a number of molecular bonds can change. Amino acids exhibit different characteristics such as being <b>polar,</b> <b>non-polar,</b> positively or negatively charged which is determined by having different side chains. Thus, attachment of molecules with different protein for example, those containing Arginine-Glycine-Asparatate (RGD) sequences are expected to modify the surface of tissue scaffolds and result in improvement of cell adhesion when placed into its physiological environment. Additional modifications of the surface could be through attachment of functional groups of 2D or 3D patterns on the surface so that cell alignment is guided and new tissue formation is improved.|$|R

Metabolite extraction {{is a key}} step in obtaining useful and reliable data for successful metabolite studies. Significant efforts {{have been made to}} identify the optimal extraction protocol for various platforms and biological systems, for both <b>polar</b> and <b>non-polar</b> metabolites. Here we report an approach utilizing chemoinformatics for systematic comparison of protocols to extract both from a single sample of the model yeast organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Three chloroform/methanol/water partitioning based extraction protocols found in literature were evaluated for their effectiveness at reproducibly extracting both <b>polar</b> and <b>non-polar</b> metabolites. Fatty acid methyl esters and methoxyamine/trimethylsilyl derivatized aqueous compounds were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry to evaluate <b>non-polar</b> or <b>polar</b> metabolite analysis. The comparative breadth and amount of recovered metabolites was evaluated using multivariate projection methods. This approach identified an optimal protocol consisting of 64 identified polar metabolites from 105 ion hits and 12 fatty acids recovered, and will potentially attenuate the error and variation associated with combining metabolite profiles from different samples for untargeted analysis with both <b>polar</b> and <b>non-polar</b> analytes.
