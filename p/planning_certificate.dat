Since limited-coverage plans are exempt from HIPAA requirements, the odd case exists in which the applicant to a general group health <b>plan</b> cannot obtain <b>certificates</b> of creditable continuous coverage for independent limited-scope plans such as dental to apply towards exclusion periods of the new plan that does include those coverages.|$|R
