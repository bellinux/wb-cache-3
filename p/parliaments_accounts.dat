40|$|The brutal {{gang rape}} and murder of a 23 -year-old student in Delhi in December 2012 has {{galvanized}} nationwide protests and the campaign for women's rights, which has brought the issue forcefully to the political table in a way that revealed the power of the Indian masses. It was expected, therefore, that women's issues would become central to the general election in 2014. However, the number of female members of <b>parliament</b> <b>accounts</b> for only 11 per cent of the 543 parliamentarians and {{is a far cry from}} the 33 per cent that Women's Reservation Bill seeks to implement.

40|$|Advocates of {{a global}} {{democratic}} parliament have expressed hopes that this would not only legitimize global governance in procedural terms, but also bring about more cosmopolitan policies. They point to the European Parliament {{as an example of}} a successful real existing democratic parliament beyond the state with cosmopolitan intent. We analyse plenary debates in the United Nations General Assembly and the European Parliament about the issues of climate change, human rights, migration, trade and European integration between 2004 and 2011 to study the nature of opposition to cosmopolitanism within these two assemblies. We find more vocal and better-organized opposition to cosmopolitanism in the European Parliament than in the United Nations General Assembly. We demonstrate the plausibility that direct and more proportional mechanisms of delegation and accountability in the case of the European <b>Parliament</b> <b>account</b> for this observed difference. Should further research confirm these initial findings, advocates {{of a global}} democratic parliament may find that an empowered democratic World Parliament would support less cosmopolitan policies than the current United Nations General Assembly.
