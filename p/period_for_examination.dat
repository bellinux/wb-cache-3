Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 42 - 44). viii, 44 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmThe 2006 Kuril tsunami, {{while not}} destructive to coastal properties, resulted in prolonged oscillations in Hawai'i waters. This study reconstructs the tsunami from the seismic source parameters using a nonlinear shallow-water model and uses spectral analysis {{to examine the}} oscillation patterns and amplifications around the Hawaiian Islands. The Fast Fourier Transform of the computed sea surface elevation reveals the frequency contents of the tsunami at each grid point Contour plots of the amplitudes of the Fourier coefficients identify the energy levels and areas where strong amplification occurs. A wavelet filter extracts the free surface time histories of around the high energy <b>periods</b> <b>for</b> <b>examination</b> of the oscillation patterns. On a regional scale, the oscillations consist of resonance in open bays and standing waves across the island chain. Large-scale standing waves appear to be generated by the oscillations of over Penguin Bank. Around O'ahu, the time-distance diagram separates the wave traveling along the coast from the standing and progressive wave. <b>For</b> <b>periods</b> smaller than 10 minutes, the oscillation patterns are dominated by edge waves capable of traveling long distances. Energetic edge waves of longer periods are also observed.

Adequate control over appetite is paramount for the control of body weight {{and in order to}} understand appetite, it is necessary to measure eating behaviour accurately. So far, research in this field has revealed that no single experimental design can answer all research questions. Each research question posed will require a specific study design that will limit the findings of that study to those particular conditions.

A comparison of the observations in the allograft and in the previously studied autograft suggests that the cells from the granulationtissue that become osteoblasts in the autograft differentiate into fibrocytes and giant cells in the allograft. Furthermore, the increased period of initial degeneration observed in the allograft (2 weeks) compared with the autograft (less than 1 week) may represent the destruction of early, graft-derived attempts at osteogenesis. This, together with the relative paucity of new bone in the allograft, suggests that some cells of graft origin may contribute to the early osteogenesis observed in the autograft...|$|E
40|$|Objective The {{potential}} risk of mortality increase {{due to the}} use of human albumin (HA) in surgical patients has not been determined yet. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the association of mortality rate of surgical patients with other indicators of the quality of health services and consumption of HA and hydroxyethyl starch (HES). Methods The study of a time series at the surgical department analyzed monthly indicators of the quality of health services. The monthly consumption of HA and HES is shown as a number of HA or HES bottles consumed in the intensive care unit (ICU) or outside the ICU. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was used for the statistical analysis. Results For the total mortality rate, four significantly predictors in moving average model were identified. The total mortality rates for each next month were significantly directly dependent on the unobserved random error from the current and previous month. Number of operated patients showed an indirect effect on the total mortality rate. Number of HA bottles consumed in the ICU, mortality rate of operated patients and patients without operation were directly associated with the increased total mortality rate. Conclusions Follow-up <b>period</b> <b>for</b> <b>examination</b> of the mortality from resuscitation with HA in a heterogeneous surgical population can not be less than two months. ARIMA can be extremely useful in determining a total period of time when all mortality due to the application of certain drug in a particular population will be manifested...|$|E

This study investigates the role of body size in national decisions on wild animal species by analysing the average body sizes of the animal species subject to species-specific legislation in the Netherlands over the period 1857 – 1995. Three legal objectives were distinguished, namely ‘control’, ‘use’ and ‘protection’. For most taxa, average body sizes of species were found to differ significantly between legal objectives within {{a substantial number of}} subperiods analysed. Throughout the entire period examined, protected bird, mammal, fish and mollusc species were of smaller average body size than those subject to use legislation and protected bird, mammal and mollusc species were also smaller than those subject to control legislation most of the time. Protected insects were generally larger than those subject to control or use. For vertebrate taxa, average sizes of protected species increased over the time <b>period</b> selected <b>for</b> <b>examination,</b> suggesting that legislation initially excluded larger vertebrates from protection, possibly partly owing to demands to maintain use of these species. The results emphasize that conservation context is important, as other studies suggest that conservation policy generally favours larger species. ...|$|R
40|$|Background & objectives: Intestinal {{parasitic}} {{infections and}} their associated complications {{are a major}} cause of morbidity in the developing world. This retrospective study was done to assess the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections among patients in a tertiary healthcare setting and to analyze age-, gender- and time-related trends in the prevalence of these intestinal parasites over a seven year period (2006 - 2012). Methods: The presence of various intestinal parasites in a tertiary care setting over a seven year period in different age groups was determined by performing routine stool microscopy. Modified acid-fast staining was performed for stool samples collected from children less than five years of age for the detection of intestinal coccidian parasites. Statistical analysis was carried out to analyze age-related trends in relation to the prevalence of commonly detected intestinal parasites. Seasonal fluctuations in parasite prevalence were evaluated by performing harmonic regression analysis. Results: A total of 257, 588 stool samples were received over the seven year <b>period</b> <b>for</b> <b>examination.</b> The highest percentage of intestinal parasites was in the 6 - 10 yr age group. Among the intestinal parasites, Giardia intestinalis had the highest prevalence across most age groups, except in those above 60 yr of age where hookworm became more prevalent. A significant decreasing trend with age was observed for G. intestinalis, whereas for hookworm and Strongyloides stercoralis, an increasing trend with age was seen. Significant linear temporal trends were observed for parasites such as G. intestinalis, Entamoeba histolytica and Ascaris lumbricoides. Interpretation & conclusions: While G. intestinalis was more common in the younger age groups, certain soil-transmitted helminths such as hookworm and S. stercoralis showed a higher prevalence in the older populations. Significant temporal trends and seasonality were observed for some of the common intestinal parasites...|$|E
40|$|Exposed {{riverine}} sediments (ERS) {{are associated}} with heterogeneous habitat patches located within the land-river ecotone. Distinctly different micro-habitats on ERS {{have been identified as}} significant for providing important refuge for a large number of invertebrate fauna, with a particularly high abundance of Coleoptera. The River Teign has been identified as hosting high quality ERS for its presence of numerous invertebrate species of conservation concern (Sadler and Bell, 2004). Two side bars were selected for investigation due to their diverse range of habitat patches. Initial characterisation of the environmental variables for 5 visually different habitat patches on each bar was conducted for examination of habitat selection preferences exhibited by Coleoptera communities. Previous studies highlighted the significance of grain size distribution, moisture content, shade, vegetation cover, distance from water, and ground temperature for variation in Coleoptera community composition on ERS. Pitfall trapping was used over a 6 week sampling <b>period</b> <b>for</b> <b>examination</b> of species abundance at each habitat patch across three sampling rounds. Univariate and multivariate statistical analysis were used to identify relationships between environmental variables and for investigation of relationships between biotic and abiotic factors. Environmental variables were recognised as strongly interrelated. Temperature and shade represented the most significant factors driving difference in habitat patches. The larger study bar had significantly higher species richness, a result of greater lateral variation. Bembidion Tetracolum and Agonum albipes were the most abundant species sampled. Both species showed high fidelity for patches with bare and exposed sediments near water. The most abundant ERS specialist species was Clivina collaris, displaying associations with areas of fine sediments with shade. Supporting the work of Fowles (2004), all ERS specialist species were found in greatest abundance on areas of more dynamic ERS near water. These findings highlight the importance of maintaining dynamic river regimes which allow frequent flood inundation for rejuvenation of ERS...|$|E
40|$|After World War II a rapid {{expansion}} of the Swedish health care took place.

The financing consisted to {{a high degree of}} government grants from the state to the county councils. During the <b>period</b> <b>for</b> this <b>examination</b> (1945 - 1955) the public responsibility for the health care was expanded.

These changes led to some discussions on the national level but reforms could on the whole, with exception for the suggested reform of the open health care, be implemented. This case-study performed on the county council in Värmland shows that the degree of consensus was enhanced on the regional level. The county council had by tradition a culture of collusion assembling to the culture in the primary municipalities, and county council was also dominated by the strong förvaltningsutskottet (the leading executive committee).

40|$|Abstract. A {{small number}} of studies have {{indicated}} that re-ductions in the signal strength of clear air returns can be ob-served at low altitudes in regions of precipitation. This study uses data from the NERC MST radar facility in Aberystwyth (52. 4 ◦N, 4. 1 ◦W) and co-located tipping bucket rain gauge data to determine whether this effect can be observed <b>for</b> all <b>periods</b> where high rainfall rates were observed at the ground. The <b>period</b> selected <b>for</b> <b>examination</b> includes all of the days where a peak rainfall rate of 6 mm h− 1 was exceeded in 2001.

The corrected spectral width of the Doppler spectra is also significantly wider during periods of precipitation. The process which causes the decrease in the VHF signal power seems to be associated with a reduction in Fresnel reflection within precipitating clouds. This, in turn, may be due to a reduction of humidity gradients in clouds.

40|$|To {{determine}} whether a previous pelvic infection {{has an effect on}} the outcome of a subsequent pregnancy, we identified women with a diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), amnionitis, and postpartum or postabortal endometritis-salpingitis by a retrospective chart review of all patients admitted to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at The New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center between 1975 and 1977 and between 1985 and 1988. Antimicrobial regimens effective against Chlamydia trachomatis were initiated in 1985. Controls were randomly selected patients presenting during the same time <b>period</b> <b>for</b> routine <b>examinations</b> who had normal Pap smears and no infections. Both groups were comparable for age, race, gravity, and parity. Differences were evaluated by chi square analysis, using the Yates correction factor. We identified 183 women with a history of the above infections who subsequently conceived, and 82 controls. There were no differences in outcome between the two index groups. Term vaginal deliveries occurred in 14. 2 % of the women with a prior pelvic infection and in 56 % of the controls (P < 0. 001). Among the 97 women who had had PID, 21 (21. 6 %) had a spontaneous abortion in the subsequent pregnancy, as opposed to 6 (7. 3 %) of the controls (P = 0. 013). In addition, eight of the women with PID (but no controls) went into preterm labor (P = 0. 021). An increased incidence of preterm labor (P = 0. 001) was also observed in women with a history of amnionitis. A history of endometritis was not associated with an increased prevalence of abnormal outcome in subsequent pregnancies. PID and amnionitis may adversely affect the outcome of subsequent pregnancies...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Long-term peritoneal {{dialysis}} with glucose- based dialysis solutions {{has been associated}} with diabetiform alterations of peritoneal tissue. A peritoneal infusion model in the rat was developed to study the effect of chronic infusion of a glucose-based dialysis solution and an isotonic non-glucose solution on the ultrastructure of the basement membranes of peritoneal capillaries. The effect of ageing was also studied in an untreated control group. METHODS: A vascular access port (Rat-o-Port) with attached peritoneal catheter was implanted subcutaneously in the neck of nine male Wistar rats. The rats were divided randomly into three groups: the glucose group (n = 3) was infused daily for 20 weeks with 60 ml/kg body weight 3. 86 % glucose solution. A control group (n = 2) was infused daily for 20 weeks with 60 ml/kg body weight Ringer's lactate. The untreated control group (n = 4) was studied {{at the onset of the}} experiment and after 20 weeks. Omental tissue was obtained from each rat at the end of the experimental <b>period</b> <b>for</b> ultrastructural <b>examination.</b> RESULTS: Extensive lamination of basement membranes of omental capillaries was found in the glucose group. This was in contrast to the untreated control group where clear, single basement membranes were seen at the onset of the experiment and after 20 weeks. These latter findings were similar to those in the Ringer's lactate group. CONCLUSIONS: The chronic infusion model in the rat is suitable for the investigation of the effects on the ultrastructure of peritoneal capillaries of chronic exposure to dialysis fluids. The duplications of basement membranes of omental capillaries found in the glucose group show a striking resemblance to those found in long-term {{peritoneal dialysis}} patients. This suggests a role for glucose in the development of peritoneal ultrastructural alterations found in long-term peritoneal dialysi...|$|R
