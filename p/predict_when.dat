25|$|Parisian {{engineer}} and astrophotographer Thierry Legault, {{known for his}} photos of spaceships crossing the Sun (called occultation), travelled to Oman in 2011, to photograph the Sun, Moon and space station all lined up.

25|$|The {{origins of}} the InterCity 125 are steeped in irony, because it was planned as a stop-gap. Research had begun for the tilting Advanced Passenger Train (APT) {{but it was not}} {{possible}} to <b>predict</b> <b>when</b> it could enter service. The HST would apply what had been learned so far to traditional technology - a parallel project based on conventional principles but incorporating the newly discovered knowledge of wheel/rail interaction and suspension design. Although the APT never achieved all its design objectives the InterCity 125 was an outstanding success.|$|E
25|$|Along with Tipu Aziz and {{his team}} at John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, and John Stein of the University of Oxford, Warwick is helping to design the next {{generation}} of deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease. Instead of stimulating the brain all the time, the goal is for the device to <b>predict</b> <b>when</b> stimulation is needed and to apply the signals prior to any tremors occurring to stop them before they even start. Recent results have also shown {{that it is possible to}} identify different types of Parkinson's Disease.|$|E
25|$|In chemistry, {{predicting}} gas solubility {{is essential}} to manufacturing polymers, but models using particle swarm optimization (PSO) tend to converge to the wrong points. An improved version of PSO has been created by introducing chaos, which keeps the simulations from getting stuck. In celestial mechanics, especially when observing asteroids, applying chaos theory leads to better predictions about when these objects will approach Earth and other planets. Four of the five moons of Pluto rotate chaotically. In quantum physics and electrical engineering, the study of large arrays of Josephson junctions benefitted greatly from chaos theory. Closer to home, coal mines have always been dangerous places where frequent natural gas leaks cause many deaths. Until recently, there was no reliable way to <b>predict</b> <b>when</b> they would occur. But these gas leaks have chaotic tendencies that, when properly modeled, can be predicted fairly accurately.|$|E

25|$|Since chance {{procedures}} {{were used by}} Cage to eliminate the composer's and the performer's likes and dislikes from music, Cage disliked the concept of improvisation, which is inevitably linked to the performer's preferences. In a number of works beginning in the 1970s, he found ways to incorporate improvisation. In Child of Tree (1975) and Branches (1976) the performers are asked to use certain species of plants as instruments, for example the cactus. The structure of the pieces is determined through the chance of their choices, as is the musical output; the performers {{had no knowledge of}} the instruments. In Inlets (1977) the performers play large water-filled conch shells – by carefully tipping the shell several times, it is possible to achieve a bubble forming inside, which produced sound. Yet, as it is impossible to <b>predict</b> <b>when</b> this would happen, the performers had to continue tipping the shells – as a result the performance was dictated by pure chance.|$|E
25|$|Groening and Cohen wanted Futurama to {{be shown}} at 8:30pm on Sunday, {{following}} The Simpsons. The Fox network disagreed, opting instead to show two episodes in the Sunday night lineup before moving the show to a regular time slot on Tuesday. Beginning with its second broadcast season Futurama was again placed in the 8:30 Sunday spot, but by mid-season the show was moved again, this time to 7:00pm on Sunday, its third position in under a year. Even by the fourth season Futurama was still being aired erratically. Due to being regularly pre-empted by sporting events, it became difficult to <b>predict</b> <b>when</b> new episodes would air. This erratic schedule resulted in Fox not airing several episodes that had been produced for seasons three and four, instead holding them over for a fifth broadcast season. According to Groening, Fox executives were not supporters of the show. Although Futurama was never officially canceled, midway through {{the production of the}} fourth season, Fox decided to stop buying episodes of Futurama, letting it go out of production before the fall 2003 lineup.|$|E
25|$|Despite its pest {{status and}} notoriety, the red {{imported}} fire ant can be beneficial. The ant {{is an effective}} insect predator, so it {{may serve as a}} biological agent against other pest species, especially in sugarcane fields. Pest insects the ant kills include: boll weevils (Anthonomus grandis) in cotton crops, sugarcane borers (Diatraea saccharalis) in sugarcane fields, horn flies (Haematobia irritans) in manure, velvetbean caterpillars (Anticarsia gemmatalis) in soybeans, and whiteflies that are found in greenhouses. A number of studies indicate that red imported fire ants do not interfere or attack insects of economic importance in cotton fields, which has resulted in many farmers in the southeastern regions of the United States viewing red imported fire ants as beneficial. However, some scientists have suggested that the beneficial status of the red imported fire ant is hard to <b>predict</b> <b>when</b> geography, plant size, season, soil moisture and the use of insecticides are not considered. These factors may lower the efficacy of red imported fire ants as pest control agents. Another factor is that workers are indiscriminate and kill beneficial insects such as predators that eat horn flies and other pests in pastures and predators of aphids and scale insects. They also reduce the efficacy of parasitic wasps against pest species by eating the larvae and pupae.|$|E

500|$|Air quality {{forecasting}} {{attempts to}} <b>predict</b> <b>when</b> {{the concentrations of}} pollutants will attain levels that are hazardous to public health. [...] The concentration of pollutants in the atmosphere is determined by their transport, or mean velocity of movement through the atmosphere, their diffusion, chemical transformation, and ground deposition. [...] In addition to pollutant source and terrain information, these models require data {{about the state of}} the fluid flow in the atmosphere to determine its transport and diffusion. [...] Meteorological conditions such as thermal inversions can prevent surface air from rising, trapping pollutants near the surface, which makes accurate forecasts of such events crucial for air quality modeling. Urban air quality models require a very fine computational mesh, requiring the use of high-resolution mesoscale weather models; in spite of this, the quality of numerical weather guidance is the main uncertainty in air quality forecasts.|$|E
500|$|Hope's playing was {{strongly}} {{based in the}} blues-influenced jazz tradition. He employed dissonant harmonies and spiky, contrasting lines and phrases. Rosenthal observed that Hope's playing {{on one of his}} compositions for the 1953 Donaldson–Brown recording illustrated [...] "many elements of the pianist's emerging style: somber, internally shifting chords in the introduction; punchy, twisting phrases in the solo; and the smoldering intensity that always characterized his best work." [...] Hope's sense of time meant that his note placement was unpredictable, falling at various points either side of the beat but not exactly on it. His use of keyboard dynamics was similarly flexible, as the listener could not <b>predict</b> <b>when</b> in a performance the level would change. The Billboard reviewer of Hope's final recordings, as reissued in 1996, wrote that [...] "he's dynamically smoother than Monk, with a spidery, spacy touch. His harmonic and compositional approach is intricate in design and almost eerie in execution." [...] Coda critic Stuart Broomer also commented on Hope's touch, suggesting that it was unusual and light, and created a combination of delicacy and boldness that was all his own. Leonard Feather and Ira Gitler summarized Hope's abilities: he had [...] "a style that parallels Powell, [...] was a pianist and composer of rare harmonic acuity and very personal interpretation." ...|$|E

2500|$|Before DDT, malaria was {{successfully}} eliminated or curtailed in several tropical areas by removing or poisoning mosquito breeding grounds and larva habitats, for example by eliminating standing water. These methods have seen little application in Africa {{for more than}} half a century. According to CDC, such methods are not practical in Africa because [...] "Anopheles gambiae, one of the primary vectors of malaria in Africa, breeds in numerous small pools of water that form due to rainfall... It is difficult, if not impossible, to <b>predict</b> <b>when</b> and where the breeding sites will form, and to find and treat them before the adults emerge." ...|$|E
2500|$|If {{resonance}} {{occurs in}} a mechanical system {{it can be very}} harmful – leading to eventual failure of the system. Consequently, one of the major reasons for vibration analysis is to <b>predict</b> <b>when</b> this type of resonance may occur and then to determine what steps to take to prevent it from occurring. As the amplitude plot shows, adding damping can significantly reduce the magnitude of the vibration. [...] Also, the magnitude can be reduced if the natural frequency can be shifted away from the forcing frequency by changing the stiffness or mass of the system. If the system cannot be changed, perhaps the forcing frequency can be shifted (for example, changing the speed of the machine generating the force).|$|E
2500|$|A [...] "resistance switching" [...] event {{can simply}} be {{enforced}} by setting the external bias to a value above a certain threshold value. This is the trivial case, i.e., the free energy barrier {{for the transition}} {i} → {j} is reduced to zero. In case one applies biases below the threshold value, {{there is still a}} finite probability that the device will switch in course of time (triggered by a random thermal fluctuation), but – as one is dealing with probabilistic processes – it is impossible to <b>predict</b> <b>when</b> the switching event will occur.

If the free energy barriers are not high enough, the memory device can even switch without having to do anything.|$|E
