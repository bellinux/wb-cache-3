5|$|The left atrium {{receives}} oxygenated blood {{back from}} the lungs via {{one of the four}} pulmonary veins. The left atrium has an outpouching called the left atrial appendage. Like the right atrium, the left atrium is lined by <b>pectinate</b> muscles. The left atrium is connected to the left ventricle by the mitral valve.|$|E
5|$|In 1843, German {{botanist}} Carl Adolf Terscheck named {{a specimen}} of cactus collected in Mexico Echinocactus reichenbachii, but his description was incomplete and proved unhelpful to later scholars. During the years 1848 to 1856, George Engelmann made extensive studies {{of a plant}} he named Echinocereus caespitosus. Prior to this Joseph zu Salm-Reifferscheidt-Dyck referred to plants in European collections as Echinopsis <b>pectinate</b> var. reichenbachiana, and he later discussed the possibility with Engelmann that these two plants were one in the same.|$|E

5|$|The right atrium {{receives}} blood almost continuously {{from the}} body's two major veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae. A {{small amount of}} blood from the coronary circulation also drains into the right atrium via the coronary sinus, which is immediately above and {{to the middle of}} the opening of the inferior vena cava. In the wall of the right atrium is an oval-shaped depression known as the fossa ovalis, which is a remnant of an opening in the fetal heart known as the foramen ovale. Most of the internal surface of the right atrium is smooth, the depression of the fossa ovalis is medial, and the anterior surface has prominent ridges of <b>pectinate</b> muscles, which are also present in the right atrial appendage.|$|E
25|$|Lymphatic {{drainage}} {{from the}} ascending colon and proximal {{two-thirds of the}} transverse colon is to the colic lymph nodes and the superior mesenteric lymph nodes, which drain into the cisterna chyli. The lymph from the distal one-third of the transverse colon, the descending colon, the sigmoid colon, and the upper rectum drain into the inferior mesenteric and colic lymph nodes. The lower rectum to the anal canal above the <b>pectinate</b> line drain to the internal iliac nodes. The anal canal below the <b>pectinate</b> line drains into the superficial inguinal nodes. The <b>pectinate</b> line only roughly marks this transition.|$|E
25|$|Oxycodone is {{marketed as}} various salts, most {{commonly}} as the hydrochloride salt. The free base conversion ratios of different salts are: hydrochloride (0.896), bitartrate (0.667), tartrate (0.750), camphosulphonate (0.576), <b>pectinate</b> (0.588), phenylpriopionate (0.678), sulphate (0.887), phosphate (0.763), and terephthalate (0.792). The hydrochloride salt {{is the basis}} of most American oxycodone products whilst bitartrate, tartrate, <b>pectinate,</b> terephthalate and phosphate salts are also available in European products. Methyiodide and hydroiodide are mentioned in older European publications.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} anatomic {{landmark in}} anal {{cancer is the}} <b>pectinate</b> line (dentate line), which is located about 1–2cm from the anal verge (where the anal mucosa of the anal canal becomes skin). Anal cancers located above this line (towards the head) {{are more likely to}} be carcinomas, whilst those located below (towards the feet) {{are more likely to be}} squamous cell carcinomas that may ulcerate. Anal cancer is strongly associated with ulcerative colitis and the sexually transmissible infections HPV and HIV. Anal cancer may be a cause of constipation or tenesmus, or may be felt as a palpable mass, although it may occasionally present as an ulcerative form.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} salts of {{morphine}} are used, {{with the most}} common in current clinical use being the hydrochloride, sulfate, tartrate, and citrate; less commonly methobromide, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, lactate, chloride, and bitartrate and the others listed below. Morphine diacetate, which is another name for heroin, is a Schedule I controlled substance, {{so it is not}} used clinically in the United States; it is a sanctioned medication in the United Kingdom and in Canada and some countries in Continental Europe, its use being particularly common (nearly to the degree of the hydrochloride salt) in the United Kingdom. Morphine meconate is a major form of the alkaloid in the poppy, as is morphine <b>pectinate,</b> nitrate, sulphate, and some others. Like codeine, dihydrocodeine and other (especially older) opiates, morphine has been used as the salicylate salt by some suppliers and can be easily compounded, imparting the therapeutic advantage of both the opioid and the NSAID; multiple barbiturate salts of morphine were also used in the past, as was/is morphine valerate, the salt of the acid being the active principle of valerian. Calcium morphenate is the intermediate in various latex and poppy-straw methods of morphine production, more rarely sodium morphenate takes its place. Morphine ascorbate and other salts such as the tannate, citrate, and acetate, phosphate, valerate and others may be present in poppy tea depending on the method of preparation. Morphine valerate produced industrially was one ingredient of a medication available for both oral and parenteral administration popular many years ago in Europe and elsewhere called Trivalin (not {{to be confused with the}} current, unrelated herbal preparation of the same name), which also included the valerates of caffeine and cocaine, with a version containing codeine valerate as a fourth ingredient being distributed under the name Tetravalin.|$|E
500|$|Hepialidae have short, <b>pectinate</b> {{antennae}} and, unusually primitive for Lepidoptera, lack {{a functional}} proboscis or retinaculum {{and are therefore}} non-feeding. [...] The moths possess several other morphological features that are considered phylogenetically primitive. [...] The gap between the fore- and hindwing is distinct and the wings are covered in scale-like hairs. [...] At {{the base of the}} forewing is a jugum, a small lobe that joins the fore- and hindwings during flight. [...] In females, the configuration of the genitalia is exoporian, typified by an external groove along which spermatophores are transferred after mating, from the copulatory opening (the ostium bursae), to the ovipore for fertilisation.|$|E

500|$|The i3 of Dermotherium {{chimaera}} is an elongate tooth bearing six tines (narrow, high [...] "fingers" [...] as in a comb) arranged {{from front}} to back. The frontmost is larger, the next four are about equal in size, and the sixth is smaller. The number of tines resembles that seen in the Sunda colugo, which has four to seven; the Philippine colugo has three to five. The c1 is also an elongate, narrow tooth; at the front, it is slightly curved towards the midline of the jaw. On the buccal (outer) side of this tooth are six cusps, of which the third (counting from the front) is the largest. The p3 is similarly elongate and rounded at the front, but it is broader at the back, forming a talonid (a [...] "heel" [...] of cusps {{at the back of}} a tribosphenic tooth). There are six cusps on the narrow anterior part of the tooth, and the fifth (identified as the protoconid) is by far the largest. On the buccal side of the talonid is a strong cusp, the hypoconid, with a crest, the cristid obliqua, descending from it towards the front. A second, smaller cusp, the hypoconulid, is present on the lingual side of the talonid, connected to the hypoconid by a postcristid. The [...] (comb-like) shape of the anterior teeth is a shared characteristic of the colugos and highly unusual among mammals. Dermotherium chimaera resembles the Sunda colugo in that the c1 and p3 are also pectinate; in the Philippine colugo, these teeth are not <b>pectinate.</b>|$|E
500|$|An {{additional}} specimen {{was described}} as a possible Sphecomyrma male, but it was never assigned to a specific species. The specimen numbered AMNH NJ-242 was collected from the White Oaks outcrop in 1995 and is currently preserved in the [...] American Museum of Natural History. The entire body of the male specimen is completely preserved. As most ant genera are based on the morphology of workers, assigning males to a species or a genus is rarely done unless they are taken from a colony. However, its size, petiole structure, the absence of the trochantellus and basal antennal structure are similar to that of a Sphecomyrma worker. It is a small ant, measuring [...] with three ocelli present on the vertex. Stiff hairs can be found on its frons and vertex. It has large eyes and the face has two pairs of long setae along with smaller setae. The scape is short and is around the same length as the flagellomere (one of the three main segments of the antenna); the pedicel is only slightly longer than the flagellomere by 0.3 times, and the total length of the antenna is [...] Most of its mouthparts are covered in bubbles from the amber, but two palpals (a pair of appendages found near the mouth) are seen protruding. The mesosoma is [...] in length and the petiole is , which has pairs of long setae on the apex of the nodus. Both tibias have a pair of setose and the apical spurs on the hind tibia is <b>pectinate.</b> The forewings measure [...] and the hindwings are 0.7 times the length of the forewings. The shape of the wings is consistent with other formicids. The hindwings have seven hamuli but none is found around the anterior portions. The gaster is [...] long and the first and second segments are equally as long as each other (these two segments alone cover two-thirds of the gaster). The terminalia (the last segments of the abdomen) is difficult to examine due to a layer of froth covering the area, but there are two pairs of setose lobes.|$|E
2500|$|Due to darkening of the cuticle in the holotype fossil, finer {{details such as}} ocelli {{location}} and suture structuring were undetectable. [...] The head has an elongated structure, being consistently taller than it is wide and the small compound eyes are placed near the midpoint between the clypeus and the rear edge. [...] At the back edge of the head the cuticle is raised into two small points. [...] In both the G. tendir workers [...] {{the middle of the}} clypeus is developed with a frontal lobe, and about twenty denticles are present on the front edge. [...] The setae of the clypeus are confined to only the middle lobe, in contrast to the other described Gerontoformica species. [...] The dark cuticle prevented description of the connection between head and mesosoma, but the lack of setae and smooth cuticle was observable. [...] There are long setae and two spurs present on the mesotibia, with one spur <b>pectinate,</b> while the other is simple. [...] The tarsomeres all have four setae near the apical ends, while the subapical tooth on each is smaller than in other species. [...] Overall the holotype specimen has a body length of about [...]|$|E
