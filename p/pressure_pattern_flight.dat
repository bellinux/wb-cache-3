40|$|How strong is the {{resemblance}} between two {{states of the}} atmosphere leading to the same outcome? In the following pages this question was addressed by studying {{the resemblance}} of the surface pressure fields, obtained by NCEP reanalyses, corresponding to ‘‘intense’’ precipitation events over 5 Italian climatic areas. Such ‘‘intense’’ precipitation events were selected by means of 45 daily precipitation records covering the period from 1951 to 2000. Two <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns</b> that resemble one another are termed soft-analogues in this paper. The mathematical measures {{used to assess the}} difference between two <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns</b> were: the root-mean-square difference, the correlation, and the S 1 score. The comparison outcomes were categorized into classes according to the previous measures. Once a couple of the <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns</b> were found to be good soft-analogues (that was a rare occurrence), these <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns</b> were compared with all <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns</b> excluded by the initial selection being not associated with intense precipitation events. The few soft-analogues associated with ‘‘intense’’ precipitation events were found to be also softanalogue to several, and sometimes a great deal of, <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns</b> not associated with the selected ‘‘intense’’ precipitation events...|$|R

40|$|In climate research, <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns</b> {{are often}} very important. When a climatologists {{need to know}} the days of a {{specific}} <b>pressure</b> <b>pattern,</b> for example "low pressure in Western areas of Japan and high pressure in Eastern areas of Japan (Japanese winter-type weather)," they have to visually check a huge number of surface weather charts. To overcome this problem, we propose an automatic classification system using a support vector machine (SVM), which is a machine-learning method. We attempted to classify <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns</b> into two classes: "winter type" and "non-winter type". For both training datasets and test datasets, we used the JRA- 25 dataset from 1981 to 2000. An experimental evaluation showed that our method obtained a greater than 0. 8 F-measure. We noted that variations in results were based on differences in training datasets...|$|R

Here we develop a tree-ring-based climate field reconstruction of cool-season 500 hPa geopotential height on a 2 2 grid over North America and the North Pacific to AD 1500 and examine the frequency and persistence of preinstrumental atmospheric <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns</b> using Self-Organizing Maps.

40|$|A {{procedure}} {{has been}} developed for predicting peak dynamic inlet distortion. This procedure combines Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and distortion synthesis analysis to obtain a prediction of peak dynamic distortion intensity and the associated instantaneous total <b>pressure</b> <b>pattern.</b> A prediction of the steady state total <b>pressure</b> <b>pattern</b> at the Aerodynamic Interface Plane is first obtained using an appropriate CFD flow solver. A corresponding inlet turbulence pattern is obtained from the CFD solution via a correlation linking root mean square (RMS) inlet turbulence to a formulation of several CFD parameters representative of flow turbulence intensity. This correlation was derived using flight data obtained from the NASA High Alpha Research Vehicle flight test program and several CFD solutions at conditions matching the flight test data. A distortion synthesis analysis is then performed on the predicted steady state total pressure and RMS turbulence patterns to yield a predicted value of dynamic distortion intensity and the associated instantaneous total <b>pressure</b> <b>pattern...</b>|$|R

40|$|Changes in {{precipitation}} distribution {{associated with}} a surface temperature rise in the late 1980 s, which accompanied a climatic regime shift, are investigated using Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System (AMeDAS) data of the Japan Meteorological Agency, and their relations with the variability of surface <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns</b> are revealed. After the temperature rise, the frequency of winter monsoon <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns</b> did not decrease. According to the classification of <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns,</b> long-term variations of surface <b>pressure</b> <b>pattern</b> frequencies showed negative relations between the winter monsoon and high-pressure patterns before 1992, which subsequently changed to the negative relations between the winter monsoon and traveling low-pressure systems. After the temperature rise, in years when low-pressure patterns prevailed, precipitation increases were observed in western Japan due to low-pressure systems traveling over the Pacific coast, and in wider areas from central Japan to Kyusyu areas due to low-pressure systems traveling over the Sea of Japan. Recently, the frequency of stationary front patterns has been increasing with precipitation increasing in the Setouchi area of western Japan. In years with a warm winter, precipitation increased in wider areas of the Pacific coast to inland areas of central Japan. In cold winters, low-pressure systems traveling over the Pacific coast decreased precipitation in central to western Japan. However, after a temperature rise, low-pressure systems traveling over the Sea of Japan decreased precipitation at {{the coast of the}} sea of Japan from central Japan to Hokkaido...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Asymmetric Dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an {{endogenous}} inhibitor of {{nitric oxide}} synthesis and {{also is an}} indicator of endothelial dysfunction. Patients who have nondipper blood <b>pressure</b> <b>pattern</b> {{have been shown to}} exhibit more endothelial dysfunction than patients who has dipper blood <b>pressure</b> <b>pattern.</b> However, other endogenous markers, but not ADMA, are used to assess endothelial function in these studies. In our study, we used ADMA levels to compare differences in endothelial function between each groups. Materials and methods: This study includes 87 patients who admitted to Düzce University internal medicine and Cardiology outpatient clinics throughout 6 months and have been diagnosed previously as essential hypertension and followed with medical therapy. Patients were divided into two groups as non-dippers and dippers, using ambulatory blood pressure measurement. Patients’ body mass index, Systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and ADMA levels were measured. Results: Age, BMI, and lipid values did not differ significantly between groups (p> 0. 05). Mean ADMA level was 1. 29 ± 0. 13 in dippers, and that of non-dippers was 1. 27 ± 0. 13 μmol/L. ADMA levels did not differ significantly between the non-dipper and dipper groups (p= 0. 575). Conclusion: ADMA levels were found to be higher in hypertensive patients due to endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction was more frequent in patients who had nondipper blood <b>pressure</b> <b>pattern</b> than patients who had dipper blood <b>pressure</b> <b>pattern.</b> In our study, ADMA levels did not differ significantly between two patterns...|$|R
40|$|Multi-decadal {{changes in}} {{patterns}} of physical phenomena and populations of marine biota occur in the Bering Sea and Eastern North Pacific Ocean. The most marked physical manifestation of these changes is a variation in modes of atmospheric <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns</b> known as a “regime shift”. The physical mechanisms that generate regime shifts are hypothesized to include such primary driving forces as the lunar-nodal tide, variations in solar radiation {{and changes in the}} North Pacific circulation that affect air-sea exchange of heat and momentum with the Aleutian Low atmospheric <b>pressure</b> <b>pattern.</b> Secondary effects include interactions among upper atmosphere <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns.</b> The cause for the variations in these <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns,</b> however, is not known. The changes in atmospheric pressure fields together with their attendant winds, moisture and momentum, transfer energy throughout the oceanic environment. These fluctuations greatly influence such phenomena as variations in the extent of sea ice, transport of nutrients into the euphotic zone, water column temperature and turbulence. Changes in these aspects of the ecosystem, in turn, influence biota both through the nutrientphytoplankton-zooplankton feeding sequence and by directly affecting biological rates and behavior. Changes in the physical environment, however, do not explain all the variations in populations. Clearly, biological interactions are also important, as are the impacts of human intervention. While our understanding of natural changes and their impact on the ecosystem is growing, many of the mechanisms that link physical to biological processes and the life histories of many species are not yet known. As our understanding of how marine populations respond to regime shifts grows, {{we will be able to}} use such knowledge toward sustaining the health and productivity of the ecosystem...|$|R

40|$|Wind {{pressure}} distributions on both {{surfaces of}} a cantilevered roof are {{measured on a}} wind tunnel model. The investigation covers a down-sloping roof configuration at - 5 ° roof angle and two up-sloping roof configurations of roof angles 5 ° and 10 °. The results supplement an earlier study made on a horizontal roof. The wind <b>pressure</b> <b>pattern</b> on the upper surface of an up-sloping roof suggests that there exists a preferred mode of flow separation on that surface. The pattern shows two localized regions of high suction, which are separately located towards the two ends of the roof span. On the up-sloping roofs, this <b>pressure</b> <b>pattern</b> is observed in the time-averaged mean distribution as well as during the occurrence instant of a peak total uplifting force on the roof. On the horizontal roof, this particular pattern of flow separation is not obviously observed in the time-averaged mean wind <b>pressure</b> <b>pattern</b> but is revealed by the conditional sampling technique which captures the wind pressure distribution during the generation of a peak uplifting force on the roof. The wind pressure signals are analysed to study {{the characteristics of the}} total wind force on the roof and also the wind forces on individual roof surfaces. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|The blood <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns</b> {{obtained}} from a linearly or stepwise deflating cuff exhibit personalized traits, such as fairly uniform peak patterns and regular beat geometry; it can support the diagnosis and monitoring of hypertensive patients with reduced sensitivity to fluctuations in Blood Pressure (BP) over time. Monitoring of personalized trait in Oscillometric Arterial Blood Pressure Measurements (OABPM) uses the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) algorithm. The representation of personalized traits with features from the oscillometric waveforms using LDA algorithm includes four phases. Data collection consists of blood pressure data using auscultatory measurements and pressure oscillations data {{obtained from}} the oscillometric method. Preprocessing involves the normalization of various sized oscillometric waveforms to a uniform size.

40|$|Wind tunnel {{tests are}} {{performed}} on a rigid {{model of a}} horizontal grandstand roof. The objective is to investigate the generation mechanism of wind pressure and peak lifting actions on a large cantilevered roof. The roof model is 780 mm wide, 150 mm deep and is equipped with 78 pairs of pressure taps covering both roof surfaces. With an electronic pressure scanning system, wind pressures at these 156 taps are measured in a near-simultaneous manner. Time histories of the wind forces on both roof surfaces and of the net wind force on the entire roof are obtained from the simultaneous pressure signals. These force signals are analyzed statistically to investigate the mechanism of peak lift forces. The conditional sampling technique is used to extract the wind <b>pressure</b> <b>pattern</b> on the lower and upper roof surfaces when a large total uplift is occurring on the roof. It is found that the occurences of peak lift and peak moments on the roof are connected with large lifting actions on both roof surfaces. Differences between the conditionally sampled <b>pressure</b> <b>pattern</b> and the time-averaged mean <b>pressure</b> <b>pattern</b> are observed and discussed.

40|$|Wind erosion causes {{severe damage}} on sandy soils in {{agricultural}} areas of north-west Europe. The weather conditions during erosion events {{are the result}} of the general atmospheric circulation and are key components in the erosion process. Principal component analysis (PCA) in combination with a non-hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted on de-seasonalized daily mean-sea-level <b>pressure</b> (MSLP) <b>patterns</b> of north-western Europe between 1973 and 1991 to determine the main synoptic types associated with wind erosion on sugar beet fields in Scania, southern Sweden. Cluster analysis of the PCA scores indicated that the observations should be grouped into 14 classes for which average MSLP patterns were computed. To assess the relationship between the patterns and wind erosion, 2 indices were computed. Index of Occurrence (10) is the ratio between the occurrence of the patterns during days with wind erosion and the occurrence during the entire wind erosion season. Index of Erosion Severity (IES) is computed by weighting the 10 with the area damaged by wind erosion associated with each <b>pressure</b> <b>pattern.</b> The IES identifies 2 <b>pressure</b> <b>patterns</b> that have significantly larger values than the other patterns. The most important is a pattern showing easterly flow over Scania, associated with 74 % (912 ha of 1235 ha) of the total damage in the study area. The second most important is a pattern showing westerly flow over Scania, associated with 5 % (63 ha) of the total damage.
