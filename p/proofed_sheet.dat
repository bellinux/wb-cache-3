60|$|This was an overstatement.

25|$|To {{gain access}} to the Press Photo Archives in Buea one is {{required}} to write an application to the corresponding authorities. There are no hard copies of photographic prints as the archives contain only negatives and <b>proof</b> <b>sheets.</b> There is no equipment to print the negatives.

With the support of a team six Cameroonians and in collaboration with the Ministry of Communication between 2013 and 2015, over 25,000 negatives and 14,000 <b>proof</b> <b>sheets</b> were digitised, a database established and conservation measures carried out.
