50|$|A <b>progress</b> <b>chart</b> is {{a reward}} system. It {{involves}} stickers or stars, and a chart {{that can be}} either printed off or made by hand. The main goal of a <b>progress</b> <b>chart</b> is to track children's learning or behavior. It {{can be used to}} curb bad behaviors and to encourage good behaviors. It is inexpensive and can be changed to fit different situations. The child earns stickers for the desired behavior and after so many stars, earns a reward.|$|E
5000|$|The {{curriculum}} {{in the academic}} component {{is similar to that}} in the traditional system. [...] Language, mathematics, history/geography and science are developed along the mastery model—through a skills list through which children progress from the beginning of school to the end. Children are tested weekly on average but it is the children who request to be tested; teachers cannot demand that tests be written. Instead a <b>Progress</b> <b>Chart</b> shows how far along the child is (80% is considered mastery). The child doesn't have to learn what he/she has already learned—if the child can pass a test without attending class, the <b>Progress</b> <b>Chart</b> is marked identically to that of a child that attended hours of classroom study. A quick learner is offered the next level of curriculum and the opportunity to tutor others. No numerical or letter-based grading system is used.|$|E

In addition, a thick horizontal line indicates the number of items produced during the year.

It is the closest thing to the Gantt charts typically used today in scheduling systems, though it is at a higher level than machine scheduling.|$|E

Several years previous to this time, he had used a chart on which the work for machines was [...] "laid out" [...] according to {{the time required to}} do it. The Gantt <b>Progress</b> <b>Chart,</b> as developed from this early form, was found to help in the making of definite plans and to be highly effective in getting those plans executed. The rate at which the work goes forward is continuously compared with the advance of time, which induces action to accelerate or retard that rate. These charts are not static records of the past: they deal with the present and future and their only connection with the past is with respect to its effect upon the future.|$|E

40|$|The {{contribution}} {{presents a}} model that is able to simulate construction duration and cost for a building project. This model predicts set of expected project costs and duration schedule depending on input parameters such as production speed, scope of work, time schedule, bonding conditions and maximum and minimum deviations from scope of work and production speed. The simulation model is able to calculate, {{on the basis of}} input level of probability, the adequate construction cost and time duration of a project. The reciprocal view attends to finding out the adequate level of probability for construction cost and activity durations. Among interpretive outputs of the application software belongs the compilation of a presumed dynamic <b>progress</b> <b>chart.</b> This <b>progress</b> <b>chart</b> represents the expected scenario of development of a building project with the mapping of potential time dislocations for particular activities. The calculation of a presumed dynamic <b>progress</b> <b>chart</b> is based on an algorithm, which calculates mean values as a partial result of the simulated building project. Construction cost and time models are, in many ways, useful tools in project management. Clients are able to make proper decisions about the time and cost schedules of their investments. Consequently, building contractors are able to schedule predicted project cost and duration before any decision is finalized...|$|E

The study suggests that the methods support different aspects of situated cognition reasonably well.

We applied a questionnaire {{to find out}} the students’ interests and used the results when preparing the actual writing tasks. The answers to the tasks were written online, through posts on Facebook. com. In order to evaluate the students’ performance, we used evaluation grids and <b>progress</b> <b>charts,</b> focusing on six different parameters for each student: cohesion, format, style, vocabulary, accuracy, and communication efficiency. In the end, we applied a questionnaire to help students to self-evaluate their own cognitive approaches. The results of the experiment confirmed that the usage of topics connected to the students’ own interests increases their ability to write functional texts. This fact seems to be mostly due to a motivation increase. It also seems that the experiment stimulated students’ metacognitive awareness: they became more confident in expressing own views and opinions, and in appreciating own progress more appropriately...|$|R
