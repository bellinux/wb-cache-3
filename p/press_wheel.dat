Studies indicated that without adequate weed control, significant yield losses occurred in groundnuts, sorghum and soybeans due to competition with weeds. Plant density of the crops was not affected, but competition with weeds reduced ground-cover and leaf area index. Competition affected growth rates, leading to lower yields. The nature of the competitive effects is discussed and data are presented on the spatial distribution of weed growth in the crops. To prevent yield reduction in groundnuts and soybeans, competition during the period of pod initiation should be avoided. In sorghum, competition must be prevented during the period of floret establishment. In groundnuts, a period of 15 weed-free days after planting prevented yield loss and the presence of too much weed at harvest. Yield losses in sorghum were prevented with about 20 weed-free days after planting. A period up to around 30 days was needed to attain negligible weed growth at harvest. It was necessary to weed soybeans up to around 30 days after planting to avoid yield loss and too much weed growth at maturity. The response of weeds to fertilizer application varied, depending on the weed vegetation and the nutrient applied. Both stimulation of growth and increase in weed density were observed.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of different tillage systems on the physical properties of two Albaqualf soils of the Central Plains region in the state of Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil. Two experiments were conducted: one in Santa Maria, RS, during the 2013 / 14 and 2014 / 15 crop seasons, and another in Formigueiro, RS, during the 2013 / 14 crop season. A randomized block experimental design with four replications was used. The treatments were: sowing using an offset double disc (T 1); sowing using a fluted coulter disc (wavy disc with 12 waves) (T 2); sowing with a knife runner opener (T 3); sowing with a knife runner opener + <b>press</b> <b>wheel</b> mechanism for ground levelling (T 4); sowing using a furrow opener upon a raised bed (T 5); and chisel plough + sowing using an offset double-disc (T 6). In the 2014 / 15 growing season, the T 4 factor was changed using a knife runner opener 0. 05 m from the planting row. A smaller reduction in the compacted subsurface soil layer was observed for both T 1 and T 2, which exhibited high soil bulk density values for the 2013 / 14 and 2014 / 15 crop seasons. Furthermore, T 3, T 5 and T 6 led to a reduction in bulk density, and increasing total porosity and macroporosity in the soil, which consequently increased water infiltration, water storage capacity, and crop yield in areas with the presence of a compacted subsurface soil layer...|$|E

Soil compaction was applied in the forms of the following treatments; Compaction on Furrow Surface (CFS), Compaction on Furrow Bottom (CFB), Compaction on Inter Rows (CIR) and non-compaction as a Control (C). The tire-soil contact pressures were selected as 0. 025, 0. 051 and 0. 076 MPa control treatment was 0. 0085 MPa. After planting and before harvesting; soil penetration resistance and soil bulk density were determined as soil properties at different soil compaction treatments stated above. Before and after harvesting period, as generative growth, plant stalk diameter, plant height, single plant dry weight, percentage of corncob, harvesting index and dry matter yield were determined. Soil penetration resistance values changed in the soil depth of 0 - 10 cm from the 0. 23 to 0. 45 MPa after planting and from the 0. 64 to 1. 15 MPa before harvesting. Also values changed 0. 32 to 0. 83 MPa in the soil depth of 10 - 20 cm after planting and from 0. 95 to 1. 33 MPa before harvesting.
