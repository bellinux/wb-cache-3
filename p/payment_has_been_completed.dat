By this time, reparations <b>payments</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>completed,</b> and the SAGs <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{restored}} to East German ownership. The five states formerly constituting the Soviet occupation zone also <b>had</b> <b>been</b> dissolved {{and replaced by}} fifteen districts (Bezirke) in 1952; the United States, Britain, and France did not recognize the fifteenth district, East Berlin. East Germany began active participation in the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon) in 1950. In 1955 Prime Minister Grotewohl was invited to Moscow and, between September 17 and 20, concluded a treaty with the Soviet Union which entered into force on October 6. According to its terms the German Democratic Republic was henceforth [...] "free to decide questions of its internal and foreign policy, including {{its relations with the}} German Federal Republic as well as with other states." [...] Although Soviet forces would temporarily remain in the country on conditions to be agreed upon, they would not interfere in the internal conditions of its social and political life. The two governments would strengthen the economic, scientific-technical, and cultural relations between them and would consult with each other on questions affecting their interests.On 14th May 1955, East Germany {{became a member of the}} Warsaw Pact and in 1956 the National People's Army (Nationale Volksarmee—NVA) was created.|$|R
