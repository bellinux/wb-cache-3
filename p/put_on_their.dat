25|$|Sometimes car {{importers}} or dealerships {{reserve a}} range of plates to <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> cars, the contracts for which are often sold on to customers with {{the purchase of a}} car. For example, Subaru bought STI-000 to STI-999 and WRX-000 to WRX-999 for their Subaru Impreza WRX and STI models.|$|E

25|$|One by one, the {{classroom}} pets wordlessly notice the ringing phone. Up {{to this point}} in the episode, they have acted like normal animals and not said a single word.

25|$|Men are {{not always}} {{themselves}} and <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> behaviour with their clothes, but if you live with a man on board ship for years, if you are continually {{with him in his}} cabin, your mind will soon find out how to appreciate him. I could forever tell of the qualities of this beloved man, Horatio Nelson. I have not shed a tear before the 21st October, and since whenever I am alone, I am quite like a child.|$|E
25|$|The Choir Program {{consists}} of three main choirs: Mixed Choir and the Men's and Women's choirs. Plano East Choir also has two audition-only groups called Sound Invention and Treblemakers. The choirs put on both a fall and a spring show during the academic year, and Sound Invention and Treblemakers also <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> own themed fall and spring shows.

25|$|Information: This is the {{day when}} {{families}} pray for the happiness and prosperity of their girls and to help ensure that they grow up healthy and beautiful. The celebration takes place both inside the home and at the seashore. Both parts are meant to ward off evil spirits from girls. Young girls <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> best kimonos and visit their friends' homes. Tiered platforms for hina ningyō (hina dolls; a set of dolls representing the emperor, empress, attendants, and musicians in ancient court dress) are {{set up in the}} home, and the family celebrates with a special meal of hishimochi (diamond-shaped rice cakes) and shirozake (rice malt with sake).|$|E
25|$|They then venerate {{the holy}} table and <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> vestments. Before putting on each vestment the priest says a prayer, usually {{drawn from the}} Psalms, bless the vestment, and kiss the cross that is sewn onto it. The deacon brings his vestments to the priest to bless and then kisses the priest's hand and withdraws to vest, saying the same prayers for the sticharia as the priest and kissing the cross on each vestment. Each subdeacon and server vesting bring his sticharion to the priest for him to bless, and then kisses the cross on it before vesting. If a bishop is present, the clergy bring their vestments for him to bless before putting them on.|$|E
25|$|The Braves <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> best {{offensive}} {{output of}} the season to date with 15 hits, eight of which came in the fifth inning alone, 11 runs – four of which also came in the fifth inning – and three home runs from Flowers, Freeman and Markakis to beat the White Sox 11-8 {{in the first of}} a three-game series. Three home runs weren't enough to overcome a five-run deficit as the Braves fell 5-4 to the White Sox in the second game of the series. The Braves concluded the series with Foltynewicz allowing five hits, no runs and two homers scored by Francoeur and Peterson to beat the White Sox 2-0.|$|E

25|$|Upon landing, {{the crew}} would <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> extravehicular {{activity}} (EVA) spacesuits and commence {{the first of}} five to seven lunar EVAs, collecting samples and deploying experiments. After completing their Lunar Sortie operations, the crew would then enter the Altair and fire the ascent stage engine to lift off from the surface, using the descent stage as a launchpad (and leaving it as a platform for future base construction). Upon entering orbit, the Altair would rendezvous and dock with the waiting Orion spacecraft, and the crew would then transfer, along with samples collected on the Moon, back to the Orion. After jettisoning the Altair, the crew would perform the Trans Earth Injection (TEI) burn for the return trip to Earth.|$|E
25|$|Shields {{began her}} {{television}} career {{at an early}} age. In 1980, she was the youngest guest star to ever appear on The Muppet Show, in which she and the Muppets <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> own version of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. She was also the youngest person to host ABC's Fridays, a Saturday Night Live-like sketch comedy show, in 1981. In one episode of the popular comedy sitcom Friends, Shields played Joey's stalker. This role led directly to her being cast in the NBC sitcom Suddenly Susan, in which she starred from 1996 until 2000, and which earned a People's Choice Award {{in the category of}} Favorite Female Performer in a New Television Series for her, in 1997, and two Golden Globe nominations.|$|E
25|$|Polly and Digory {{grab her}} and <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> rings {{to take her}} out of their world, {{dragging}} with them Uncle Andrew, Frank the cab-driver, and Frank's horse, since all were touching one another when the children grabbed their rings. In the Wood between the Worlds they jump into a pool, hoping it leads back to Charn. Instead they stumble into a dark void that Jadis recognises as a world not yet created. They then all witness {{the creation of a}} new world by the lion Aslan, who brings stars, plants, and animals into existence as he sings. Jadis, as terrified by his singing as the others are attracted to it, tries to kill Aslan with the iron rod; but it rebounds harmlessly off him, and in the creative soil of the new world it sprouts into a growing lamp-post. Jadis flees.|$|E
60|$|Sliding {{down the}} {{hillside}} had loosened the {{load on the}} sled, {{and they had to}} spend a good five minutes in fastening it and mending a strap that had broken. Then several minutes more were consumed in <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> skates.|$|R
60|$|They {{had reached}} the river once more, and were busy <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> skates, when they heard a shout behind them. Turning, they beheld a man who, {{as soon as he}} saw they were looking in his direction, waved his hand at them.|$|R

25|$|However, it {{was soon}} {{determined}} {{that half of the}} lifeboats, those on the port side, were unlaunchable due to the severe list, which left them high in the air. To make matters worse, the list also complicated normal lifeboat procedures on the starboard side. Instead of loading lifeboats {{at the side of the}} Promenade Deck and then lowering them into the water, it would be necessary to lower the boats empty, and somehow get evacuees down the exterior of the ship to water level to board. This was eventually accomplished through ropes and Jacob's ladders. In fear of causing a panic and stampeding of the starboard lifeboats, Captain Calamai decided against giving the order to abandon ship until help arrived. In the meantime, Second Officer Badano made announcements over the loudspeaker system instructing passengers to <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> lifebelts and go to their designated muster stations.|$|E
25|$|Having {{seen the}} armed blacks, {{some of the}} more than 1,000 whites at the {{courthouse}} went home for their own guns. Others headed for the National Guard armory at Sixth Street and Norfolk Avenue, where they planned to arm up. The armory contained a supply of small arms and ammunition. Major James Bell of the 180th Infantry had already learned of the mounting situation downtown and the possibility of a break-in, and he took appropriate measures to prevent this. He called the commanders of the three National Guard units in Tulsa, who ordered all the Guard members to <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> uniforms and report quickly to the armory. When a group of whites arrived and began pulling at the grating over a window, Bell went outside to confront the crowd of 300–400 men. Bell told them that the Guard members inside were armed and prepared to shoot anyone who tried to enter. After this show of force, the crowd withdrew from the armory.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of a ritual that provides one {{with the ability to}} turn into a wolf. Such a transformation may be related either to lycanthropy itself, a widespread phenomenon, but attested especially in the Balkans-Carpathian region, or a ritual imitation of the behavior and appearance of the wolf. Such a ritual was presumably a military initiation, potentially reserved to a secret brotherhood of warriors (or Männerbünde). To become formidable warriors they would assimilate behavior of the wolf, wearing wolf skins during the ritual. Traces related to wolves as a cult or as totems were found in this area since the Neolithic period, including the Vinča culture artifacts: wolf statues and fairly rudimentary figurines representing dancers with a wolf mask. The items could indicate warrior initiation rites, or ceremonies in which young people <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> seasonal wolf masks. The element of unity of beliefs about werewolves and lycanthropy exists in the magical-religious experience of mystical solidarity with the wolf by whatever means used to obtain it. But all have one original myth, a primary event.|$|E
6000|$|They {{then put}} the [...] "dummy" [...] in a pillow case, which they had bought for it at Versailles. Before <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> caps, they {{fastened}} the quills with the dispatches in their hair. In a belt, underneath their jackets, each carried a heavy revolver.|$|R

25|$|The initial premise for {{the show}} was a Romeo and Juliet style romance storyline which {{revolved}} around two families, the wealthy Hamilton family who lived in Sydney, and the Palmers, a working-class family from Melbourne. The characters of John Palmer (Peter Phelps) and spoilt rich girl Angela Hamilton (Ally Fowler) meet by chance whilst John is {{on the run from}} the police for a murder he did not commit. The two fall in love, not realising that they are actually twins, separated at birth 20 years earlier following an affair between their parents, David Palmer (Tom Richards) and Patricia (Rowena Wallace). Early episodes saw the pair discover the truth about their heritage and showed the problems and strains this <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> own relationship and those of their immediate families. While on the run John is protected in Sydney by Fiona Thompson (Pat McDonald), a former madame and prostitute and now boarding house owner who had raised John {{when he was a young}} boy. With a new identity and now going by the name of Scott Edwards, John attempts to build a new life, with the help of Fiona and her friend Jill Taylor (Kim Lewis), another former prostitute.|$|E
500|$|On the New Directions {{collaboration}} with Sue on [...] "Sing", Futterman wrote, [...] "By turning down {{the rock and}} bringing in a choral element, the song actually came off as a great anthem for the bunch of misfits that is the New Directions. We kind of wish they had <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> choir robes instead and fully embraced the arrangement." [...] Although Gonzalez gave the performance a [...] "B", she called it [...] "lacking" [...] and not [...] "regionals material": [...] "We need to be blown away." [...] TV Guide also listed this rendition as one of Glee worst performances.|$|E
500|$|The Dean of Westminster {{picks up}} the crown and he, the {{archbishop}} and several other high-ranking bishops proceed to the Coronation Chair where the crown is handed back to the archbishop, who reverently places it on the monarch's head.

Peers of the realm and officers of arms <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> coronets, the trumpeters sound a fanfare and church bells ring out across the kingdom, as gun salutes echo from the Tower of London and Hyde Park.|$|E
60|$|In {{a moment}} more Dick, Tom, and Sam {{were in their}} own room and <b>putting</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> heavy {{overcoats}} and their hats. They lost no time, and as they heard Jasper Grinder coming up one flight of stairs they ran down another pair leading into the kitchen.|$|R
