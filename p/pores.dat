5|$|Because {{the nuclear}} {{membrane}} is impermeable to large molecules, nuclear <b>pores</b> {{are required to}} regulate nuclear transport of molecules across the envelope. The <b>pores</b> cross both nuclear membranes, providing a channel through which larger molecules must be actively transported by carrier proteins while allowing free movement of small molecules and ions. Movement of large molecules such as proteins and RNA through the <b>pores</b> is required for both gene expression {{and the maintenance of}} chromosomes. Although the interior of the nucleus does not contain any membrane-bound sub compartments, its contents are not uniform, and a number of sub-nuclear bodies exist, made up of unique proteins, RNA molecules, and particular parts of the chromosomes. The best-known of these is the nucleolus, which is mainly involved in the assembly of ribosomes. After being produced in the nucleolus, ribosomes are exported to the cytoplasm where they translate mRNA.|$|E

30|$|This {{investigation}} is performed on a reservoir formation subjected to high in situ <b>pore</b> pressure and <b>pore</b> pressure gradient. The <b>pore</b> pressure at the wellbore face is 23.95  MPa {{with an initial}} overburden <b>pore</b> pressure gradient of 0.01  MPa/m and initial lateral <b>pore</b> pressure gradient of 2.13  MPa/m. The lateral <b>pore</b> pressure gradient {{is indicative of the}} reservoir drawdown. Both vertical and horizontal <b>pore</b> pressure gradients are considerably large (see Zhang 2011); the stress and strains generated are thus expected to be in accordance with field conditions under high naturally occurring <b>pore</b> pressure.|$|R
5|$|Nuclear <b>pores,</b> {{which provide}} aqueous {{channels}} through the envelope, {{are composed of}} multiple proteins, collectively referred to as nucleoporins. The <b>pores</b> are about 125 million daltons in molecular weight and consist of around 50 (in yeast) to several hundred proteins (in vertebrates). The <b>pores</b> are 100nm in total diameter; however, the gap through which molecules freely diffuse is only about 9nm wide, due {{to the presence of}} regulatory systems within the center of the pore. This size selectively allows the passage of small water-soluble molecules while preventing larger molecules, such as nucleic acids and larger proteins, from inappropriately entering or exiting the nucleus. These large molecules must be actively transported into the nucleus instead. The nucleus of a typical mammalian cell will have about 3000 to 4000 <b>pores</b> throughout its envelope, each of which contains an eightfold-symmetric ring-shaped structure at a position where the inner and outer membranes fuse. Attached to the ring is a structure called the nuclear basket that extends into the nucleoplasm, and a series of filamentous extensions that reach into the cytoplasm. Both structures serve to mediate binding to nuclear transport proteins.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit body}} of the North American species Chalciporus piperatoides are similar, but can be {{distinguished}} by its flesh and <b>pores</b> staining blue after cutting or bruising. It has a less peppery taste. Another mild-tasting relative, C.rubinellus, has brighter colours than C.piperatus, including completely red tubes. One European species, C.rubinus, has a shape similar to C.piperatus, but has red <b>pores</b> and a stem covered in red dots.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear {{envelope}} surrounds the nucleus, separating its contents from the cytoplasm. It has two membranes, each a lipid bilayer with associated proteins. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the {{rough endoplasmic reticulum}} membrane, and like that structure, features ribosomes attached to the surface. The outer membrane is also continuous with the inner nuclear membrane since the two layers are fused together at numerous tiny holes called nuclear <b>pores</b> that perforate the {{nuclear envelope}}. These <b>pores</b> are about 120 nm in diameter and regulate the passage of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm, permitting some {{to pass through the}} membrane, but not others. Since the nuclear <b>pores</b> are located in an area of high traffic, they {{play an important role in}} the physiology of cells. The space between the outer and inner membranes is called the perinuclear space and is joined with the lumen of the rough ER.|$|E
30|$|With the {{statistical}} properties almost as {{same as those}} of real core, 3 D digital core reconstructed through CT scanning has the complex <b>pore</b> structure. Its <b>pore</b> shape and size are randomly distributed, and the throat connecting <b>pore</b> is complex. The characteristics of <b>pore</b> result in great difficulty in quantitatively characterizing <b>pore</b> structure. Thus, based on digital core constructed through CT scanning, the <b>pore</b> parameters of reconstructed digital core are optimized through process simulation method (Mustafa et al. 2009), and the <b>pore</b> network model is extracted accurately from 3 D digital core with maximal ball algorithm presented by Al-Kharusi and Blunt (2007). After effectively identifying and defining <b>pore</b> and throat of rock, the <b>pore</b> diameter, throat diameter, <b>pore</b> volume, throat volume, coordination number, pore–throat ratio, shape factor and throat length, and other key parameters are measured. Then, quantitative characterization of micropore structure is conducted through mathematical statistics. The structure of 3 D <b>pore</b> network model corresponds well to that of real rock, and the topological structure of real <b>pore</b> space reflects the characteristics of initial <b>pore</b> structure.|$|R

Analysis of {{results showed that}} mercury intrusion distorts the structure due to application of high pressure. Liquid extrusion does not require high pressures, gives good resolution and measures <b>pore</b> structure relevant for application. Capillary flow porometry uses low pressures, measures <b>pore</b> throat diameter, but does not measure <b>pore</b> volume...|$|R
40|$|The grey {{correlation}} {{theory and}} multiple regression method {{are used to}} reveal macro performance degradation rules of road concrete under loading and freeze-thaw and drying-wetting cycles; then the correlation between mesoscopic <b>pore</b> structure and residual strength and antifreezing index of concrete is analyzed. Under the freeze-thaw and drying-wetting cycles with 50 % loading level, the <b>pore</b> structure parameters that influence concrete strength show the following sequence: fractal dimension > most probable <b>pore</b> size > porosity > less harmful <b>pore.</b> The correlation between strength and <b>pore</b> parameters can be represented with multiple nonlinear equations. A negative correlation is shown between strength and fractal dimension and most probable <b>pore</b> size. Conversely, a positive correlation is shown between strength, porosity, and less harmful <b>pore.</b> Under the freeze-thaw and drying-wetting cycles with 80 % loading level, the <b>pore</b> structure parameters that influence concrete strength show another sequence: fractal dimension > porosity > less harmful <b>pore</b> > most probable <b>pore</b> size. The correlation between antifreezing index and <b>pore</b> parameters should be described with multiple linear equations. The relative dynamic elastic modulus shows a positive correlation to most probable <b>pore</b> size, <b>pore</b> surface area, and porosity but a negative correlation to less harmful <b>pore</b> and <b>pore</b> spacing coefficient...|$|R
5|$|The overall {{colouration}} of Caloboletus calopus, {{with its}} pale cap, yellow <b>pores</b> and red stipe, is not shared {{with any other}} bolete. Large pale specimens resemble Suillellus luridus, and the cap of Rubroboletus satanas is a similar colour but this species has red <b>pores.</b> Fruit bodies in poor condition could be confused with Xerocomellus chrysenteron but the stipes of this species are not reticulated. Edible species such as B.edulis lack a red stipe. It closely resembles the similarly inedible C.radicans, which lacks the redness on the stipe. Like C.calopus, the western North American species C.rubripes also has a bitter taste, similarly coloured cap, and yellowish <b>pores</b> that bruise blue, but it lacks reticulation on its reddish stipe. Found in northwestern North America, B.coniferarum lacks reddish or pinkish colouration in its yellow reticulate stipe, and has a darker, olive-grey to deep brown cap.|$|E

The adsorption in a slit <b>pore</b> model is compared against the adsorption for a defected <b>pore</b> model. The isotherms of the defected <b>pore</b> model are qualitatively different from those of the slit <b>pore</b> and similar to those of amorphous carbon models presented in the literature.

5|$|Boletus pinophilus {{is known}} to be a bioaccumulator of the heavy metals mercury, cadmium and selenium. To reduce exposure, {{authorities}} recommend avoiding mushrooms from polluted areas such as those near mines, smelters, roadways, incinerators and disposal sites. Furthermore, <b>pores</b> should be removed as they contain the highest concentrations of pollutants.|$|E
5|$|Like other boletes, Boletus pinophilus has small <b>pores</b> on the {{underside}} of its cap rather than gills. These are coloured white at first, becoming yellow with age and olivaceous-brown at full maturity. The spores are cylindric-ellipsoid, smooth, with oil drops and dimensions 15.520 by 4.55.5µm. They produce an olive-brown spore print.|$|E

40|$|Underground rocks {{usually have}} complex <b>pore</b> {{system with a}} variety of <b>pore</b> types and a wide range of <b>pore</b> size. The effects of <b>pore</b> {{structure}} on elastic wave attenuation cannot be neglected. We investigated the <b>pore</b> structure effects on P-wave scattering attenuation in dry rocks by pore-scale modeling based on the wave theory and the similarity principle. Our modeling results indicate that <b>pore</b> size, <b>pore</b> shape (such as aspect ratio), and <b>pore</b> density are important factors influencing P-wave scattering attenuation in porous rocks, and can explain the variation of scattering attenuation at the same porosity. From the perspective of scattering attenuation, porous rocks can safely suit to the long wavelength assumption when the ratio of wavelength to <b>pore</b> size is larger than 15. Under the long wavelength condition, the scattering attenuation coefficient increases as a power function as the <b>pore</b> density increases, and it increases exponentially with the increase in aspect ratio. For a certain porosity, rocks with smaller aspect ratio and/or larger <b>pore</b> size have stronger scattering attenuation. When the <b>pore</b> aspect ratio is larger than 0. 5, the variation of scattering attenuation at the same porosity is dominantly caused by <b>pore</b> size and almost independent of the <b>pore</b> aspect ratio. These results lay a foundation for <b>pore</b> structure inversion from elastic wave responses in porous rocks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Coating <b>pore</b> {{structure}} of low gloss coated paper based on different pigment blends was analyzed using mercury intrusion method in this paper. The {{results show that}} <b>pore</b> size of coating layer {{structure of}} low gloss coated paper ranges from 20 nm- 500 nm, and the range from 500 nm- 5000 nm is mainly from base paper and interactions between coating color and base paper. Printability of coated paper can be well related with coating <b>pore</b> structure. Print gloss is strongly influenced by <b>pore</b> size and <b>pore</b> volume. Large <b>pore</b> diameters and small <b>pore</b> volume of coating layer structure can improve print gloss. Ink density increases with the increasing of <b>pore</b> diameter while the <b>pore</b> volume is kept constant. The increasing of <b>pore</b> volume of coat layer structure will improve capillary absorption and then improve ink absorption.
