50|$|In June 2006 nearly 70 {{countries}} had {{freedom of information}} legislations applying to information held by government bodies and in certain circumstances to <b>private</b> <b>bodies.</b> In 19 of these countries {{the freedom of information}} legislation also applied to <b>private</b> <b>bodies.</b> Access to information was increasingly recognised as a prerequisite for transparency and accountability of governments, as facilitating consumers' ability to make informed choices, and as safeguarding citizens against mismanagement and corruption. This has led an increasing number of countries to enact freedom of information legislation in the past 10 years. In recent years, <b>private</b> <b>bodies</b> have started to perform functions which were previously carried out by public bodies. Privatisation and de-regulation saw banks, telecommunications companies, hospitals and universities being run by private entities, leading to demands for the extension of freedom of information legislation to cover <b>private</b> <b>bodies.</b>|$|R
