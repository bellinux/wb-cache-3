40|$|AbstractThe Caenorhabditis elegans vulva is {{comprised}} of highly similar anterior and posterior halves that are arranged in a mirror symmetric pattern. The cell lineages that form each half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vulva</b> are identical, except that they occur in opposite orientations {{with respect to the}} anterior/posterior axis.

40|$|Paget's disease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vulva</b> {{and breast}} are rare diseases. Unlike Paget's disease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breast, where the {{consensus}} is that <b>the</b> great majority <b>of</b> cases are associated with an in- situ or invasive ductal carcinoma, only approximately 10 - 30 % of cases of Paget's disease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vulva</b> have an invasive adenocarcinoma present. It is believed that the Paget cells in Paget's disease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breast are derived from the underlying in-situ or invasive breast carcinoma, and these cells migrate up through the ducts onto the nipple epidermis. The histogenesis underlying vulval Paget's disease is unclear. Paget's disease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vulva</b> may become secondarily invasive even in <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> an underlying malignancy. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study was to identify abnormalities present in Paget's diseases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vulva</b> and <b>the</b> breast and to investigate whether there are any differences in molecular markers in <b>the</b> Paget cells <b>of</b> those cases with invasive disease compared to those cases without invasive disease. Such an analysis may identify some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> molecular pathways underlying both vulval and breast Paget's disease, as well as generating potential markers for clinical prognosis. Archival paraffin wax-embedded sections of Paget's disease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vulva</b> or breast were used. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to analyse markers involved in the cell cycle (p 53, pRb, cyclin Dl, Ki 67), in angiogenesis (e. g. VEGF, PD-ECGF/TP, MVD) and cell adhesion molecules (e. g. plakoglobin, E-cadherin, ~-catenin). Sections that were immunopositive for the tumour marker p 53 were microdissected, the DNA extracted, amplified and sequenced. In situ hybridisation was also used to determine <b>the</b> presence ofmRNA <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adhesion molecules in the tissue sections. A national register for Paget's disease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vulva</b> was established requesting that clinicians who have patients with Paget's disease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vulva</b> should enrol them. Results suggest E-cadherin, plakoglobin and pRb and p 53 may {{have a role to play}} in <b>the</b> pathogenesis <b>of</b> Paget's disease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vulva</b> and pRb, plakoglobin, VEGF and PD- ECGF/TP in Paget's disease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breast.

40|$|BACKGROUND: "Intestinal-type" mucinous {{carcinoma}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vulva</b> is extremely rare {{with very few}} cases reported in the literature. CASE REPORT: The authors report two patients who had diagnosis of intestinal-type mucinous adenocarcinoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vulva</b> after excisional biopsy. In both cases, restaging was perfomed with total body computed tomography (CT) scan, gastroscopy, and colonoscopy that showed no other site of disease. A radical vulvectomy with bilateral systematic inguinal lymphadenectomy was performed, and in both cases no residual disease was found. A patient developed metastatic (liver, bone marrow) colonic cancer 36 months after primary surgery, received multiple lines of chemotherapy, and died of disseminated disease 18 months after diagnosis. The other patient {{was found to have}} dysplastic polyp in the sigmoid colon, and is alive without disease at 39 months after primary diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Intestinal-type {{mucinous carcinoma}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vulva</b> has a poor prognosis. Strict endoscopic follow-up <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colon is mandatory in such cases, considering <b>the</b> high propensity <b>of</b> associated gastrointestinal (GI) tumors...|$|R
