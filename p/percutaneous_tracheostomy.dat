5000|$|While {{there were}} some earlier false starts, the first widely {{accepted}} percutaneous tracheotomy technique was described by Pat Ciaglia, a New York surgeon, in 1985. This technique involves a series of sequential dilatations using a set of seven dilators of progressively larger size. The next widely used technique was developed in 1989 by Bill Griggs, an Australian intensive care specialist. This technique {{involves the use of}} a specially modified pair of forceps with a central hole enabling them to pass over a guidewire enabling the performance of the main dilation in a single step. Since then a number of other techniques have been described. In 1995, Fantoni developed a translaryngeal approach of <b>percutaneous</b> <b>tracheostomy</b> which involves passing a guidewire through the larynx and over it railroading a tracheostomy tube with a cone shaped structure. It is also known as the In-and-out procedure. A variant of the original Ciaglia technique, using a single tapered dilator known as a [...] "blue rhino", is the most commonly used of these newer techniques and has largely taken over from the early multiple dilator technique. Ambesh SP (2005) introduced a T-Trach kit (T-Dagger) which contains a T-shaped dilator with an elliptical shaft. The shaft of the dilator is marked in its length according to the sizes of tracheostomy tube to be introduced and has a number of holes. This T-shaped dilator provides better grip during its introduction and its elliptical shaft forms a calibrated tracheal stoma between two tracheal rings and minimizes tracheal ring fracture. The Griggs and Ciaglia Blue Rhino techniques are the two main techniques in current use. A number of comparison studies have been undertaken between these two techniques with no clear differences emerging ...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{short-term}} {{safety of}} <b>percutaneous</b> dilatational <b>tracheostomy</b> {{has been widely}} demonstrated. However, less is known about their long-term complications. Through an illustrative case series, we present and define “corkscrew stenosis,” a type of tracheal stenosis uniquely associated with <b>percutaneous</b> dilatational <b>tracheostomy.</b> MethodsPatients treated at our institution for tracheal stenosis after <b>percutaneous</b> dilatational <b>tracheostomy</b> were reviewed. Demographic data including gender, age, history of presentation, lesion morphology, imaging, and management was collected and evaluated. The pathology of the stenosis and the strategies for prevention are presented. ResultsFrom January, 2008 through December 2011, 11 patients had tracheal stenosis after <b>percutaneous</b> dilatational <b>tracheostomy.</b> The mean age was 54  ±  17 years and 55 % were male. The stenotic lesions were characterized by a corkscrew morphology at the stoma site with a mean distance of 2. 3  ±  0. 8 cm from the vocal cords. Images of these lesions demonstrated disruption and fracture of the proximal tracheal cartilages and displacement of the anterior tracheal wall into the tracheal lumen. The majority of our patients required tracheal resection for definitive repair. ConclusionsWe suggest that a unique form of tracheal stenosis can result from <b>percutaneous</b> dilatational <b>tracheostomy.</b> We observed corkscrew stenosis to be located proximally, associated with fractured tracheal rings, and morphologically appearing as interdigitation of these fractured rings. Recognizing corkscrew stenosis, its unique mechanism of formation, and technical means of prevention may be important in advancing the long-term safety of this procedure for critically ill patients who require prolonged ventilatory support...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the feasibility of real-time ultrasound guidance during <b>percutaneous</b> dilatational <b>tracheostomy,</b> including in patients with risk factors such as coagulopathy, cervical spine immobilization and morbid obesity. Use of real-time ultrasound guidance {{has been shown to}} improve the technical accuracy of percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy; however, it is unclear if there is an associated reduction in complications. Our objective was to determine whether the peri-procedural use of real-time ultrasound guidance is associated with a reduction in complications of <b>percutaneous</b> dilatational <b>tracheostomy</b> using a propensity score analysis. Methods This study reviewed all <b>percutaneous</b> dilatational <b>tracheostomies</b> performed in an 8 -year period in a neurocritical care unit. <b>Percutaneous</b> dilatational <b>tracheostomies</b> were typically performed by trainees under guidance of the attending intensivist. Bronchoscopic guidance was used for all procedures with addition of real-time ultrasound guidance at the discretion of the attending physician. Real-time ultrasound guidance was used to guide endotracheal tube withdrawal, guide tracheal puncture, identify guidewire entry level and confirm bilateral lung sliding. The primary outcome was a composite of previously defined complications including (among others) bleeding, infection, loss of airway, inability to complete procedure, need for revision, granuloma and early dislodgement. Propensity score analysis was used to ensure that the relationship of not using real-time ultrasound guidance with the probability of an adverse outcome was examined within groups of patients having similar covariate profiles. Covariates included were age, gender, body mass index, diagnosis, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, timing of tracheostomy, positive end-expiratory pressure and presence of risk factors including coagulopathy, cervical spine immobilization and prior tracheostomy. Results A total of 200 patients underwent <b>percutaneous</b> dilatational <b>tracheostomy</b> during the specified period, and 107 received real-time ultrasound guidance. Risk factors for <b>percutaneous</b> dilatational <b>tracheostomy</b> were present in 63 (32 %). There were nine complications in the group without real-time ultrasound guidance: bleeding (n[*]=[*] 4), need for revision related to inability to ventilate or dislodgement (n[*]=[*] 3) and symptomatic granuloma (n[*]=[*] 2). There was one complication in the real-time ultrasound guidance group (early dislodgement). The odds of having an adverse outcome for patients receiving real-time ultrasound guidance were significantly lower (odds ratio[*]=[*] 0. 08; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 009 to 0. 811; P[*]=[*] 0. 032) than for those receiving a standard technique while holding the propensity score quartile fixed. Conclusions The use of real-time ultrasound guidance during <b>percutaneous</b> dilatational <b>tracheostomy</b> was associated with a significant reduction in procedure-related complications...|$|R
30|$|Conclusions: We {{observed}} a low incidence of perioperative complications {{in our patient}} population, {{as well as a}} very low incidence of postoperative complications compared with that reported in the reviewed articles, no serious complications in any patient who perform <b>percutaneous</b> <b>tracheostomy</b> were observed. We strongly recommend <b>percutaneous</b> <b>tracheostomy</b> as a safe method to the bedside of most patients in critical condition, regardless of their disease.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: <b>Percutaneous</b> <b>tracheostomy</b> is {{frequently}} performed in long-term ventilated {{patients in the}} intensive care unit (ICU). Unfortunately, despite many years of experience, the optimal technique is still unknown, especially considering the occurrence of late complications. The purpose of this study was to determine which of the two most frequently used <b>percutaneous</b> <b>tracheostomy</b> techniques performs best with the emphasis on late complications. METHODS: This prospective randomized trial involved 120 patients, comparing two techniques of <b>percutaneous</b> <b>tracheostomy,</b> the guide wire dilating forceps (GWDF) and the single step dilatational tracheostomy (SSDT) technique. RESULTS: Sixty patients in each group underwent a <b>percutaneous</b> <b>tracheostomy</b> and were followed for up to 3 months after decannulation. The majority of complications in both groups were minor (58. 3 % in the GWDF group and 61. 7 % in the SSDT group). We found a trend towards more major perioperative complications in the GWDF group versus the SSDT group, 10. 0 versus 1. 7 % (p = 0. 06). One patient in the SSDT group developed a significant tracheal stenosis. However, this may also have been related to prolonged translaryngeal intubation. Results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) investigations showed only minor tracheal changes. Only 37. 5 % of patients in the GWDF group and 31. 8 % in the SSDT group had no complaints after their <b>percutaneous</b> <b>tracheostomy.</b> CONCLUSION: Compared with the GWDF, the SSDT shows a trend toward less major perioperative complications with a comparable long-term outcome...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review is to discuss the various {{techniques}} of <b>percutaneous</b> <b>tracheostomy</b> and to assess their safety and efficacy profile, indications and contraindications, early and late complications. Literature was reviewed from Medline and MD Consult databases. Early techniques by Sheldon, toye and Schachner have been abandoned due to their high complication rates. Percutaneous dilational tracheostomy using the Ciaglia kit (Wiliam Cook Europe Bjaeverskov) and a Griggs kit (Portex PDT kit, POrtex, Hythe, Kent, UK) has been used most often. Griggs guide Wire Dilator Forceps kit (SIMS, Portex, Hythe, Kent, UK) is the next most common in use but its long-term studies are few. Fantoni (TLT set, Mallinckrodt Medical) and PercuTwist device (Riisch, Kernen, Germany) are two new techniques currently under study. Percutaneous dilational tracheostomy and conventional surgical tracheostomy are still competing methods to provide an airway for intensive care patient requiring assisted ventilation. Review of literature shows that <b>percutaneous</b> <b>tracheostomy</b> is safe, cost-effective and compares favourably with the open surgical tracheostomy.

3000|$|Introduction: Spondylitis ankylosans (Bechterew's disease) is {{a common}} disease with an {{incidence}} of about 0.5  % in Europe. <b>Percutaneous</b> dilatational <b>tracheostomy</b> {{is a common}} procedure in Intensive Care Units. [...]. Intubation and tracheostomy can be complicated by deformities of the cervical spine and the temporomandibular joints and cervical spine. A combination of cervical kyphosis and osteoporosis also leads to complexities in patient positioning.|$|R
50|$|The translaryngeal <b>tracheostomy</b> is a <b>percutaneous</b> {{technique}} {{characterized by}} the exclusive procedure {{to carry out the}} stoma. A cone of soft plastic material, welded to a flexible cannula, is passed into trachea through the glottis, and then extracted outside of the neck through the pretracheal layers.The direction of this dilational manoeuvre is from the inside of the tracheal lumen to the outside of the neck (In/Out) and therefore completely opposite to the Out/In of other traditional <b>percutaneous</b> <b>tracheostomies.</b> The cone is then separated from the cannula, which results in it being positioned in the trachea.This method ensures considerable advantages, two of which are of particular importance: the abolition of the risk of perforation of the posterior wall and the reduction of local trauma to a level that is unlikely to be further lowered.The use of a ventilation catheter {{during the time of the}} procedure allows full control of the airway and to extend the indications of the technique to patients with severe respiratory failure.|$|R
