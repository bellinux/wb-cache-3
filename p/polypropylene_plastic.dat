Benzophenone levels were determined in different packaging materials used for cakes, to evaluate the safety of printed paperboard intended for food contact. For this, a simple extraction method and a rapid specific reverse-phase high performance chromatography method with UV detection were developed. Benzophenone was quantified in different samples by a rapid specific reverse-phase high performance chromatography method after extraction with acetonitrile at 70 °C for 24 h. A novel method for testing benzophenone diffusion towards plastics was also developed and different experiments were conducted in order to measure diffusion coefficients at 70 °C for 2 days and at 40 °C for 10 days. <b>Polypropylene</b> <b>plastics</b> sleeves were found not to be an effective barrier against benzophenone diffusion (3, 800 µg/g of benzhophenone was found after 48 h at 70 °C in cakes protected with this film) whereas, the corresponding value in cakes wrapped with a multilayer film of PP/EVOH/PP was reduced to 1, 400 µg/g, and the concentration of benzophenone in cakes wrapped with a multilayer film of PET/SiOx/PE was negligible.

40|$|Academics’ and practitioners’ {{interest}} in sustainable {{supply chain management}} has received great concern in recent years. The application of biaxially-oriented <b>polypropylene</b> (BOPP) <b>plastic</b> film has had a significant influence on the economic, environmental and social performance of supply chain management. However, research on the integration of these three sustainable dimensions is still rare in this field. In this paper, we identify sustainability criteria based on a triple bottom line approach (economic benefit, environmental protection and social responsibility) from the supply chain perspective, develop a hybrid multi-criteria decision making framework to evaluate the criteria and select alternatives and apply the proposed approach to a real case study at a focal BOPP plastic film company in China. In the framework, a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) is {{used to determine the}} performance criteria weights and a fuzzy technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (FTOPSIS) is applied to rank the alternatives. The case study finds that the economic dimension was the most important aspect with environmental second and social third. The results also verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

40|$|Recycling of {{secondary}} raw materials {{is a priority}} of waste handling in {{the countries of the}} Europeancommunity. A potentially important secondary raw material is the product of the thermal transformationof cement–asbestos, produced by prolonged annealing at 1200 – 1300 C. The product is chemically comparableto a Mg-rich clinker. Previous work has assured the reliability of the transformation process. Thecurrent challenge is to find potential applications as secondary raw material. Recycling of thermally treatedasbestos-containing material (named KRY-AS) in traditional ceramics has already been studied withsuccessful results. The results presented here are the outcome of a long termed project started in 2005 and devoted to therecycling of this secondary raw materials in various industrial applications. KRY-AS can be added in medium-high percentages (10 – 40 wt%) to commercial mixtures for the production of clay bricks, rock-woolglasses for insulation as well as Ca-based frits and glass–ceramics for the production of ceramic tiles.
