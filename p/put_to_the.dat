In September 1997, the 1997 Scottish devolution referendum was <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Scottish electorate and secured a majority in favour of the establishment of a new devolved Scottish Parliament, with tax-varying powers, in Edinburgh.

60|$|But indeed, at that time, <b>putting</b> <b>to</b> {{death was}} a recipe much in vogue with all trades and professions, and not least of all with Tellson's. Death is Nature's remedy for all things, and why not Legislation's? Accordingly, <b>the</b> forger was <b>put</b> <b>to</b> Death; <b>the</b> utterer of a bad note was <b>put</b> <b>to</b> Death; <b>the</b> {{unlawful}} opener of a letter was <b>put</b> <b>to</b> Death; <b>the</b> purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was <b>put</b> <b>to</b> Death; <b>the</b> holder of a horse at Tellson's door, who made off with it, was <b>put</b> <b>to</b> Death; <b>the</b> coiner of a bad shilling was <b>put</b> <b>to</b> Death; <b>the</b> sounders of three-fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of Crime, were <b>put</b> <b>to</b> Death. Not that it did the least good {{in the way of}} prevention--it might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the reverse--but, it cleared off (as <b>to</b> this world) <b>the</b> trouble of each particular case, and left nothing else connected with it to be looked after. Thus, Tellson's, in its day, like greater places of business, its contemporaries, had taken so many lives, that, if the heads laid low before it had been ranged on Temple Bar instead of being privately disposed of, they would probably have excluded what little light the ground floor had, in a rather significant manner.|$|R

This objectivity was <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> test when Nigerian Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa {{declared a state of emergency}} in the Western Region, responding to a series of conflicts between officials of varying parties.

5|$|As the Byzantines {{relied upon}} the Ghassanids {{to cover the}} {{approaches}} to Syria, Mundhir's withdrawal left {{a gap in the}} Byzantine southern flank, which persisted for three years until 575 when Mundhir returned to the Byzantine allegiance through the mediation of the general Justinian, who met Mundhir at Sergiopolis. Immediately after this reconciliation, Mundhir assembled an army in secret and launched an attack against Hirah, the Lakhmid capital, arguably the Arab world's largest, richest, and most culturally vibrant city at the time. The city was sacked, plundered, and <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> torch, except for the churches. According to John of Ephesus, Mundhir donated much of his booty from this expedition to monasteries and the poor. The same year, Mundhir visited Constantinople, where he was awarded a crown or diadem (stemma), marking the formal renewal of his role as Byzantium's chief Arab client-king.|$|E
5|$|Committee {{inquiries}} typically {{begin with}} the reference of an issue or a proposed law to the committee for inquiry and report back to the Senate. The committee will make a call for submissions, seeking public input on the matter referred to the committee. It will often publish those submissions to help inform stakeholders of the views that are being <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> committee. A committee will often hold one or more public hearings, at which committee members ask questions of key stakeholders interested in the issue under inquiry. These hearings may be held anywhere in Australia, are often broadcast, and result in a published transcript (Hansard) that records the evidence taken. The opportunity to make submissions, and the greater accessibility of the committees compared to parliament itself, can provide disadvantaged individuals and organisations valued opportunities to engage in democratic processes. Committees also frequently ask relevant government agencies to respond to issues raised by submissions or evidence given to the inquiry. Once evidence has been gathered there usually follows a period of research and analysis by the committee. It will then deliver {{a report to the}} Senate, which will generally include recommendations. The Commonwealth government is then expected to table a response to the report, stating responses to any recommendations the committee may have made.|$|E
