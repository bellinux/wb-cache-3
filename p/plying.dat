Matrix cracks are assumed to initiate from manufacturing defects and can propagate within planes parallel to the fiber direction and normal to the <b>ply</b> mid-plane. Fracture mechanics models of cracks in unidirectional laminates, embedded <b>plies</b> and outer <b>plies</b> are developed to determine the onset and direction of propagation for unstable crack growth. The models for each <b>ply</b> configuration relate <b>ply</b> thickness and <b>ply</b> toughness to the corresponding in-situ <b>ply</b> strength.

40|$|Cellular {{structures}} are generally assembled with face sheet <b>plies</b> in their application. It {{is necessary to}} understand the influence of assembled <b>plies</b> on deformation and energy absorption before using textile composite cellular structures in engineering design. In this paper, effects of <b>ply</b> assembly, outer <b>ply</b> material, outer <b>ply</b> thickness, and loading area on energy absorption and deformation of the applied structure including cellular structure and face sheet <b>plies</b> are investigated. Three-dimensional finite element analyses are carried out employing orthotropic mechanical properties of the applied materials, textile composite, wood, E-glass, aluminium alloy 2024 -T 3 and unidirectional fiber-epoxy composite T- 300. The predicted results show that deformation and distributed strain energy density of both outer and inner surfaces of the applied structure are significantly affected by <b>ply</b> assembly, outer <b>ply</b> material, outer <b>ply</b> thickness, and loading area...|$|R

5|$|Watchet {{developed}} as a town thanks to its closeness to the minerals within the Brendon Hills, and its access to the River Severn for onward shipping. Aside from local ships <b>plying</b> trade across the river, from 1564 onwards the port was used for import of salt and wine from France. In 1643 during the English Civil War, a Royalist ship was sent to Watchet to reinforce for the siege of Dunster Castle. Parliamentarian (Roundhead) Captain Popham ordered his troops into the sea with the tide on the ebb, and with the ship unable to move, attacked the ship with fire from their carbines. Taken by surprise and under heavy attack, the Royalist commander surrendered the ship, resulting in a ship technically at sea being captured by troops on horseback.|$|E
5|$|While {{extensive}} {{technical studies}} and the raising of finance for the project were in progress, the city expanded significantly resulting in a twofold rise in population and a fivefold {{rise in the number}} of vehicles between 1981 and 1998. Consequently, traffic congestion and pollution soared, as an increasing number of commuters took to private vehicles with the existing bus system unable to bear the load. An attempt at privatising the bus transport system in 1992 merely compounded the problem, with inexperienced operators <b>plying</b> poorly maintained, noisy and polluting buses on lengthy routes, resulting in long waiting times, unreliable service, extreme overcrowding, unqualified drivers, speeding and reckless driving. To rectify the situation, the Government of India and the Government of Delhi jointly set up a company called the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on 3 May 1995, with E. Sreedharan as the managing director.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the early}} Norman castles were built from timber, {{but by the end}} of the 11thcentury a few, {{including}} the Tower of London, had been renovated or replaced with stone. Work on the White Tower– which gives the whole castle its name– is usually considered to have begun in 1078, however the exact date is uncertain. William made Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester, responsible for its construction, although it may not have been completed until after William's death in 1087. The White Tower is the earliest stone keep in England, and was the strongest point {{of the early}} castle. It also contained grand accommodation for the king. At the latest, it was probably finished by 1100 when Bishop Ranulf Flambard was imprisoned there. Flambard was loathed by the English for exacting harsh taxes. Although he is the first recorded prisoner held in the Tower, he was also the first person to escape from it, using a smuggled rope secreted in a butt of wine. He was held in luxury and permitted servants, but on 2 February 1101 he hosted a banquet for his captors. After <b>plying</b> them with drink, when no one was looking he lowered himself from a secluded chamber, and out of the Tower. The escape came as such a surprise that one contemporary chronicler accused the bishop of witchcraft.|$|E

5|$|William Burke {{was born}} in 1792 in Urney, County Tyrone, Ireland, one of two sons to middle-class parents. Burke, along with his brother, Constantine, had a {{comfortable}} upbringing, and both joined the army as teenagers. Burke served in the Donegal Militia, until he met and married a woman from County Mayo, where they later settled. The marriage was short-lived; in 1818, after an argument with his father-in-law over land ownership, Burke deserted his wife and family. He moved to Scotland and became a labourer, working on the Union Canal. He settled in the small village of Maddiston near Falkirk, and set up home with Helen McDougal, whom he affectionately nicknamed Nelly; she became his second wife. After a few years, and when the works on the canal were finished, the couple moved to Tanners Close, Edinburgh, in November 1827. They became hawkers, selling second-hand clothes to impoverished locals. Burke then became a cobbler, a trade in which he experienced some success, earning upwards of £1 a week. He became known locally as an industrious and good-humoured man who often entertained his clients by singing and dancing to them on their doorsteps while <b>plying</b> his trade. Although raised as a Roman Catholic, Burke became a regular worshiper at Presbyterian religious meetings held in Grassmarket; he was seldom seen without a bible.|$|E

40|$|Streptococcus pneumoniae is {{a leading}} cause of human {{diseases}} such as pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, and otitis media. Pneumolysin (<b>Ply)</b> is an important virulence factor of S. pneumoniae and a promising future vaccine target. However, the expansion of clones carrying <b>ply</b> alleles with reduced hemolytic activity has been observed in serotypes associated with outbreaks of invasive disease and includes an allele identified in a highly virulent serotype 1 isolate (<b>ply</b> 4496). The virulence of Ply-deficient and <b>ply</b> allelic-replacement derivatives of S. pneumoniae D 39 was compared with that of wild-type D 39. In addition, the protective immunogenicity of <b>Ply</b> against pneumococci with low versus high hemolytic activity was also investigated. Replacement of D 39 <b>ply</b> with <b>ply</b> 4496 resulted in a small but statistically significant reduction of virulence. However, both native Ply- and <b>Ply</b> 4496 -expressing strains were significantly more virulent than a Ply-deficient mutant. While the numbers of both Ply- and <b>Ply</b> 4496 -expressing isolate cells were higher in the blood than the numbers of Ply-deficient mutant cells, the growth of the <b>Ply</b> 4496 -expressing strain was superior to that of the wild type in the first 15 h postchallenge. <b>Ply</b> immunization provided protection regardless of the hemolytic activity of the challenge strain. In summary, we show that low-hemolytic-activity <b>Ply</b> alleles contribute to systemic virulence and may provide a survival advantage in the blood.
