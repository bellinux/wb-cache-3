40|$|Issues in English Teaching invites {{primary and}} {{secondary}} teachers of English to engage in debates about key issues in subject teaching. The issues discussed include: *the increasingly centralised control of the curriculum, assessment, and pedagogy in the school teaching of English in England and Wales {{as a result of}} initiatives such as the National Literacy Strategy *new technologies which are transforming pupils' lived experience of literacy or literacies *the accelerating globalisation of English and the independence of other versions of English from English Standard English. A National Curriculum with a nationalist perspective on language, literacy and literature cannot fully accommodate English *what has become 'naturalised' and 'normalised' in English teaching, and the educational and ideological reasons for this *hierarchies that have been created in the curriculum and pedagogy, identifying who and what has been given low status, excluded or marginalised {{in the development of the}} current model of English. Issues in English Teaching will stimulate student teachers, NQTs, language and literacy co-ordinators, classroom English teachers and aspiring or <b>practising</b> <b>Heads</b> of English, to reflect on the identity or the subject, the principles and policies which, have determined practice, and those which should influence future practice...|$|R

One woman wears an {{ornament}} through her ear, whilst her companion wears a thin bracelet. Scarification marks {{can be seen on}} the arm of each woman. In the Congo, marking the body through scarring in patterns then controlling the healing process was an important cultural signifier, often carried out to indicate life stages or cultural belonging, with peoples of the Congo having some of the most complex designs in Africa. In women, scarification marks were added to intenisfy beauty, or to mark stages in life, such as childbirth - bearing the pain involved in the process was believed to be a path to adulthood and a sign of strength that would be needed in childbearing. The heads of the women are slightly elongated, as a likely result of the practice of headbinding. The malleable skulls of babies would be wrapped tightly in cloth in order to produce an elongated head shape, mostly as a sign of cultural belonging and beauty. The Mangbetu people of the Congo <b>practised</b> <b>head</b> binding, and it is to this group that these women may belong. In the memoir of the work of her husband and herself for the Congo Balolo Mission, Lily Ruskin also speaks of head binding for babies of the Yamongo people, whom Edward Algernon Ruskin first encountered in 1895.

40|$|This report {{provides}} {{an evaluation of}} the Flexible Route to Headship (FRH) pilot project. The evaluation was undertaken by a research team was from the universities of Glasgow and Cambridge during 2007 - 8 and was funded by the Scottish Government. This report documents the perspectives of a range of participants in the pilot, particularly in respect of the development of candidates in satisfying the Standard for Headship, the development of coaches, the nature and sustainability of assessment and the capacity implications associated with a potential “roll out” of the FRH across Scotland by Local Authorities. The evaluation occurred at about the mid-point of the pilot’s duration. A series of qualitative procedures were used to obtain data (e. g., documents, interviews, focus groups and observations). Using each of these sources, the evaluation team was able to research all aspects of the operation of the pilot. The team sees the FRH playing {{an important role in the}} future development of Scottish head teachers. On the basis of the evidence it acquired, the evaluation team has made 21 recommendations. These recommendations are intended to strengthen that development role. In the framing of the recommendations, the team drew liberally on the reflections of a number of informants and, where appropriate, elaborated and aligned its arguments with existing bodies of research literature. Throughout the pilot, the centrepiece and unique feature of the FRH was the coaching provided to aspiring (and some <b>practising)</b> <b>head</b> teachers by a dedicated group of coaches. The coaching experiences documented in this report, the team believes, together comprise an important case study in coaching and provide significant lessons and insights for this globally emerging approach to school leader development. The report included 21 recommendations for the further development and management of the FRH. </p...|$|R

The average weight of passenger trains had greatly increased in the 1880s and 1890s due to the demand for more comfortable, better-appointed and safer carriages. Combined with continually rising passenger volumes and the competition between railway companies to offer faster services and locomotive engineers were faced with producing engines that could operate longer, heavier trains at faster speeds. The existing pattern of inside-cylinder 4-4-0 express engine was reaching the limits of its development and many railways were resorting to the inefficient <b>practise</b> of double <b>heading</b> to maintain schedules.|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{self-management}} of head teachers and its application {{in the present}} which is characterized by an environment of never-ending changes which place considerable demands on the overall preparedness of school management to face these demands. This theses has been completed using search of available literature and free Internet resources related to this issue. The theoretical part explains the basic concepts related to the topic. The personality and skills of managers are also described there. Based on the analysis and comparison of scientific literature I describe the techniques and procedures recommended by the authors who deal with this issue. With {{the help of a}} survey in the form of half-structured interviews with managers of education in different types of schools in a district town I {{try to find out what}} self-management techniques covering the biological, psychological and social areas are <b>practised</b> by <b>head</b> teachers in order to maintain and develop relevant skills.

40|$|Problems {{with the}} safety and shelf life of export hake have been raised by the Namibian fishing industry. This {{prompted}} {{an investigation into the}} factors that may {{have an impact on the}} microbiological quality and safety of processed hake. Samples were collected along the processing line; the general microbiological quality (mesophylic and psychrotrophic aerobic plate counts), total Vibrio species and common fish spoilage bacterial counts were performed. The results constantly showed relatively high counts for the psychrotrophic and spoilage bacteria, indicating that most of these bacteria already formed part of the incoming fish. Hake is headed and gutted on board of fishing vessels and delivered to the factory only after 7 – 8 days for final processing. It is likely that this <b>practise</b> of <b>heading</b> and gutting the hake may have a negative effect on microbiological quality of the final product. A sharp increase in the mesophilic and sucrose fermenting Vibrio species counts were observed after filleting. It has been suggested that this contamination could be due to biofilms present in the distribution system for the treated sea-water used during processing. Although, sea-water could be an alternative source of water for marine fish processing plants, the treatment and the quality of the water needs to be carefully managed. We would like to thank the Ministry of Education of Namibia for funding this research, the Department of Microbiology and Plant, Pathology University of Pretoria for making the research facilities available and the Fish Processing Plant in Walvis Bay, Namibia for permitting us to use their facility.

It was a {{beautiful}} day, one of his very own 'mild days' of this month. He kindly consented, and walked with us to meet the carriage at Pelter Bridge. On our drive, he mentioned, with marked pleasure, a dedication written by Mr. Keble, and sent to him for his approval, and for his permission to have it prefixed to Mr. Keble's new volumes of Latin Lectures on Poetry delivered at Oxford. Mr. Wordsworth said that he had never seen any estimate of his poetical powers, or more especially of his aims in poetry, that appeared to him so discriminating and so satisfactory. He considers praise a perilous and a difficult thing. On this subject he often quotes his lamented friend, Sir George Beaumont, whom, in his intercourse with men of genius, literary aspirants, he describes as admirable in the modesty which he inculcated and <b>practised</b> on this <b>head.</b>|$|R
