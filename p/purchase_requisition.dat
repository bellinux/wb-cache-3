40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{illustrate}} the top-down approach within a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), a demonstrator was developed in cooperation with IBM Deutschland GmbH, IDS Scheer AG and SAP AG. A real world <b>purchase</b> <b>requisition</b> process at DaimlerChrysler AG was chosen for the demonstrator. Tools and services of different vendors {{were used for the}} project involving efforts of the vendors to improve compatibility among each other. As the <b>purchase</b> <b>requisition</b> process was implemented following the topdown approach, first a business process model was created using extended Event-driven Process Chains (eEPCs). The model was converted into WS-BPEL (Web Services Business Process Execution Language) and the resulting WS-BPEL was used for creating the IT implementation of the process. Finally, the process was ready for deployment on a process server. In addition to this, the process was modified in order to demonstrate the flexibility and agility that can be achieved with a SOA. A fast implementation of the process change was shown. The process modification was also carried out based on the top-down approach starting with a change of the business process model. However, an insufficient stage of maturity of SOA development software was recognized. ...|$|E

PT Indesso Aroma as a manufacturing company of essential oils, natural extracts, and aromatic chemicals products needs to improve its conventional procurement process to e-procurement to be more effective and efficient. For that, a research is conducted towards the performance and interest of the company 2 ̆ 7 s procurement system. Furthermore, the current SAP system application support is developed, as the customer values are analyzed using gap analysis to see the benefits of its application for the company. The e-procurement design uses OOAD method with UML diagram notation including analysis of problem domain, application domain, architectural design and component design. Cost-benefit analysis is performed to see an increase in customer value from the e-procurement application based on measurements of NPV, IRR and ROI of investing in the e-procurement design. Thus an e-procurement application is created that is expected to improve the company 2 ̆ 7 s procurement process with several key features such as <b>Purchase</b> <b>requisition,</b> Purchase Order, Purchase Return, Supplier Catalog and Supplier Quotation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Reference models, whose aim is {{to capture}} domain knowledge, can assist in the {{adequate}} design of enterprise specific business processes. In complex organisations, business processes can be locally designed by specific organisational units. However, {{in order to be}} adequate, these processes should meet the local needs while maintaining the organisational standards. For this purpose, we propose to create an organisational reference model that specifies the organisational standards, guides and constrains the different organisational units when designing their specialised local processes. We propose a reference modelling approach called application-based domain modelling (ADOM), which is capable of specifying guidelines and constraints as part of the reference model and validating a specific model against the reference model. The paper presents the principles of ADOM and in particular, its novel validation procedure. This procedure enables the organisation to ensure that the local processes are in compliance with the organisational standards, as specified in the reference model. We demonstrate the validation procedure on a <b>purchase</b> <b>requisition</b> reference model within a university and its application in two sub units: a library and an acquisition department...|$|E
40|$|The Hazardous Material Reduction Initiative (HMRI) explores {{using the}} review of <b>purchase</b> <b>requisitions</b> to reduce both the use of {{hazardous}} materials and the generation of regulated and nonregulated wastes. Based on an 11 -month program implemented at the Hanford Site, hazardous material use and waste generation was effectively reduced by using a centralized procurement control program known as HMRI. As expected, several changes to the original proposal were needed during the development/testing phase of the program to accommodate changing and actual conditions found at the Hanford Site. The current method requires a central receiving point within the Procurement Organization to review all <b>purchase</b> <b>requisitions</b> for potentially Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) hazardous products. Those requisitions (approximately 4 % to 6 % of the total) are then forwarded to Pollution Prevention personnel for evaluation under HMRI. The {{first step is to}} determine if the requested item can be filled by existing or surplus material. The requisitions that cannot filled by existing or surplus material are then sorted into two groups based on applicability to the HMRI project. For example, laboratory requests for analytical reagents or standards are excluded and the <b>purchase</b> <b>requisitions</b> are returned to Procurement for normal processing because, although regulated, there is little opportunity for source reduction due to the strict protocols followed. Each item is then checked to determine if it is regulated or not. Regulated items are prioritized based on hazardous contents, quantity requested, and end use. Copies of these requisitions are made and the originals are returned to Procurement within 1 -hr. Since changes to the requisition can be made at later stages during procurement, the HMRI fulfills one of its original premises in that it does not slow the procurement process...|$|R
