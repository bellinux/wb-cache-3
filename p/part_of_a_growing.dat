2500|$|Tylor's {{definition}} of animism was a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> international {{debate on the}} nature of 'primitive society' by lawyers, theologians, and philologists. The debate defined the field of research of a new science – anthropology. By {{the end of the nineteenth}} century, an orthodoxy on 'primitive society' had emerged, although few anthropologists today would accept their definition; the 'nineteenth century armchair anthropologists' argued 'primitive society' (an evolutionary category) was ordered by kinship and was divided into exogamous descent groups related by a series of marriage exchanges. Their religion was animism – the belief that natural species and objects had souls. With the development of private property, these descent groups were displaced by the emergence of the territorial state. These rituals and beliefs eventually evolved over time into the vast array of [...] "developed" [...] religions. According to Tylor, the more scientifically advanced a society became, the fewer members of that society believed in animism; however, any remnant ideologies of souls or spirits, to Tylor, represented [...] "survivals" [...] of the original animism of early humanity.|$|E
2500|$|Meantime, Innis asserts, Roman prose [...] "gained fresh {{power in}} {{attempts}} to meet problems of the Republic." [...] He is apparently referring to the vast enrichment of the Roman aristocracy and upper middle class as wealth poured in from newly conquered provinces. [...] "The plunder from the provinces provided the funds for that orgy of corrupt and selfish wealth which was to consume the Republic in revolution," [...] writes Will Durant in his series of volumes called The Story of Civilization. Innis mentions that the large-scale farms owned by aristocrats brought protests presumably from small farmers forced off the land and into the cities as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> urban proletariat. The Gracchi brothers were among the first, Innis writes, [...] "to use the weapon of Greek rhetoric" [...] in their failed attempts to secure democratic reforms. Gaius Gracchus made Latin prose more vivid and powerful. Innis adds that political speeches such as his [...] "were given wider publicity through an enlarged circle of readers." [...] As political oratory shaped Latin prose style, written speech almost equaled the power of oral speech.|$|E

40|$|In a {{seed plant}} a pollen tube is a vessel that {{transports}} male gamete cells to an ovule to achieve fertilization. It consists of one elongated cell, which exhibits growth oscillations, until it bursts completing its function. Up till now, the mechanism behind the periodic {{character of the}} growth has not been fully understood. An attempt to understand these oscillations lead us to an attractive scenario: We show that the mechanism of pressure-induced symmetry frustration occuring in the wall at the perimeter of cylindrical and approximately hemispherical <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> pollen cell, together {{with the addition of}} cell wall material, suffices to release and sustain mechanical self-oscillations and cell extension in pollen tubes. At the transition zone where symmetry frustration occurs and one cannot distinguish either of the involved symmetries, <b>a</b> kind <b>of</b> 'entangled state' appears where either single or both symmetry(ies) can be realized by the system. We anticipate that testifiable predictions made by the model may deliver, after calibration, a new tool to estimate turgor pressure from oscillation period of the growing cell. Since the mechanical principles apply to all turgor regulated walled cells including those of plant, fungal and bacterial origin, the relevance of this work {{is not limited to the}} case of the pollen tube.
