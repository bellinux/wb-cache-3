40|$|For this study, we {{developed}} a simple <b>pressure</b> <b>and</b> heat stimulator that can quantitatively control <b>pressure</b> <b>and</b> provide heat stimulation to intra- and interdigit areas. The developed stimulator consists of a control unit, drive units, and tactors. The control unit controls the stimulation parameters, such as stimulation types, intensity, time, and channel, and transmits a created signal of stimulation to the drive units. The drive units operate <b>pressure</b> <b>and</b> heat tactors in response to commands from the control unit. The <b>pressure</b> <b>and</b> heat tactors can display various stimulation intensities quantitatively, apply stimulation continuously, and adjust the stimulation areas. Additionally, they can easily be attached to and detached from the digits.

The new stimulator operated stably in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) environment without affecting the obtained images. A preliminary {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) experiment confirmed that differences in activation of somatosensory areas were induced from the <b>pressure</b> <b>and</b> heat stimulation.

5|$|Difficulties {{with the}} {{diffusers}} and pumps paled into insignificance besides {{those with the}} porous barrier. In order to work, the gaseous diffusion process required a barrier with microscopic holes, but not subject to plugging.

The latter criterion suggested a nickel barrier. Foster C. Nix at the Bell Telephone Laboratories experimented with nickel powder, while Edward O. Norris at the C. O. Jelliff Manufacturing Corporation and Edward Adler at the City College of New York worked on a design with electroplated metallic nickel.
