40|$|The {{effect of}} {{lisinopril}} 5 - 20 mg once daily or enalapril 5 - 20 mg once daily on exercise capacity, ventricular ectopic activity, and {{signs and symptoms}} of heart failure have been studied in 278 patients with mild-to-moderate (New York Heart Association [NYHA] classes II and III) heart failure in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of 12 weeks' duration. Exercise duration was significantly increased by both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment compared with their respective baseline values. There was a trend toward a greater increase in exercise duration on lisinopril after 12 weeks, although this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0. 0748). There were no significant treatment differences with respect to the effect of the 2 drugs on ventricular ectopic counts, couplets, or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Both drugs were equally effective in improving NYHA grading and symptoms. Neither treatment had any significant effect on mean heart rate or mean blood pressures. Both treatments were equally well tolerated. The most commonly reported adverse events on both drugs were cough, dizziness, fall in blood <b>pressure,</b> <b>vertigo,</b> and myocardial infarction. The results {{of this study indicate that}} lisinopril 5 - 20 mg once daily is at least as effective and well tolerated as enalapril 5 - 20 mg once daily...|$|E

40|$|Superior canal {{dehiscence}} (SCD) {{syndrome is}} characterized by sound and <b>pressure</b> induced <b>vertigo</b> accompanying vertical-torsional nystagmus. Since the severity of symptoms and signs in SCD may depend {{on the amount of}} bony dehiscence of the superior semicircular canal, typi-cal clinical presentations are not always accompanied in every patient. And symptoms of SCD are frequently vague and non-specific, such as aural fullness, disequilibrium or floating sensation of dizziness. Routine vestibular laboratory tests cannot provide disease-specific di-agnostic clue, which makes this diagnosis more difficult. This review provides information to understand the pathophysiologic mechanism of symptoms and signs in SCD, and characteris-tic features of diagnostic tests targeted to SCD.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Superior {{semicircular canal}} {{dehiscence}} represents a manageable cause {{of sound and}} <b>pressure</b> induced <b>vertigo.</b> This case highlights its presentation and investigation, including {{a review of the}} literature, and the authors' surgical technique used in its successful treatment. Case presentation A 45 -year-old Caucasian man presented with vertigo induced by sound or pressure. Subsequent investigation revealed dehiscence of the superior semicircular canal and the patient underwent a surgical repair. Conclusion Surgery to repair or resurface the dehiscence represents an effective treatment modality, offering a resolution of symptoms with no detrimental effect on hearing or long-term sequelae. A five-layer composite repair consisting of temporalis fascia – bone pate – conchal cartilage – bone pate – temporalis fascia {{has been found to be}} safe and effective. </p...|$|R

We report a unique occurrence {{of such a}} combination in a 50 -year-old man who presented with features of elevated intracranial <b>pressure,</b> ataxia and <b>vertigo.</b> Magnetic resonance imaging showed a diffuse non-enhancing lesion in the temporal lobe and insula and another non-contigous well defined enhancing lesion in the cerebellum. Both the lesions had mass effect. The lesions were decompressed; first the temporal lesion and then the cerebellar lesion. Histopathology revealed grade II astrocytoma in the temporal lobe and glioblastoma multiforme in the cerebellum.

40|$|Superior {{semicircular canal}} {{dehiscence}} syndrome was first reported by Lloyd Minor and colleagues in 1998. Patients with a dehiscence {{in the bone}} overlying the superior semicircular canal experience symptoms of <b>pressure</b> or sound-induced <b>vertigo,</b> bone conduction hyperacusis, and pulsatile tinnitus. The initial series of patients were diagnosed based on common symptoms, a physical examination finding of eye movements in {{the plane of the}} superior semicircular canal when ear canal pressure or loud tones were applied to the ear, and high-resolution computed tomography imaging demonstrating a dehiscence in the bone over the superior semicircular canal. Research productivity directed at understanding better methods for diagnosing and treating this condition has substantially increased over the last two decades. We now have a sound understanding of the pathophysiology of third mobile window syndromes, higher resolution imaging protocols, and several sensitive and specific diagnostic tests. Furthermore, we have a treatment (surgical occlusion of the superior semicircular canal) that has demonstrated efficacy. This review will highlight some of the fundamental insights gained in SCDS, propose diagnostic criteria, and discuss future research directions...|$|R

An etiologic role for the herpes family isassumed. Corticosteroids possess a limited beneficial effect onhearing recovery inISSHL. Inthis study, we evaluated the therapeutic value of the antiherpetic drug acyclovir (Zovirax) onhearing recovery in 91 patients with ISSHL who received prednisolone ina prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. The audiomet-ric parameters included pure tone and speech audiometry. Subjective parameters studied included hearing recovery, a pressure sen-sation in the affected ear, vertigo, and tinnitus. A I-year follow-up was obtained. Hearing recovery for the whole group averaged about 35 dB and was independent {{of the severity of}} the initial hearing loss orvestibular involvement. Speech audiometry improved from 49 % to 75 %. After 12 months, <b>pressure</b> sensation and <b>vertigo</b> decreased to 15. 6 % (acyclovir) and 10. 3 % (placebo) and 12. 5 % (acyclovir) and 10. 7 % (placebo), respectively. Tinnitus decreased slightly, to 46. 9 % (acyclovir) and 55. 2 % (placebo), in the same period (p>. 05 for all parameters). We conclude that nobeneficial effect from combining acyclovir with prednisolone can beestab-lished inpatients with ISSHL. KEY WORDS- acyclovir, clinical trial, sudden hearing loss, therapy...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the factors associated with better or worse quality of life in a sample of people with Meniere's disease drawn from a UK self-help group (the Meniere's Society) and to assess the forms of support on which the respondents could draw. A postal survey was sent to 1000 randomly selected group members, containing validated questionnaires assessing: (1) quality of life (the Short Form 36 (SF- 36)) (2) factors that might predict quality of life; and (3) usage of resources provided to members by the Meniere's Society. A total of 509 members completed the main survey, and 370 the second part of the survey. Factors associated with a less good quality of life included more severe <b>vertigo,</b> <b>pressure</b> in the ear, hearing loss and tinnitus, being younger, being female, living alone, having a lower occupational status and believing that the attitude of the consultant is unhelpful. Levels of vertigo severity in this sample were similar to those found in hospital samples, but it is possible that these respondents may differ in other respects from patients who do not join a self-help group...|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of {{increased}} water intake on ambulatory blood pressure (BP) in healthy individuals. Blood pressure was recorded after 2 weeks of either regular (RWI) or extra water intake (EWI, an additional 30 ml water/kg body weight per day) in 20 healthy subjects (10 males, 10 females). The extra water intake (RWI: 1. 7 +/- 0. 59 l, EWI: 3. 7 +/- 0. 84 l, respectively, p andlt; 0. 0001, i. e., an increase of 2 liters) induced an increase in mean arterial daytime BP from 89. 0 +/- 5. 5 mmHg during RWI to 91. 4 +/- 6. 4 mmHg during the EWI phase (p = 0. 005), while night-time BP was unchanged by the intervention. The visual-analogue-scale (VAS, maximum score of 10) score corresponding to the statement "I often experience vertigo" was 3. 1 +/- 2. 6 during RWI and decreased to 2. 1 +/- 2. 1 during EWI phase (p = 0. 008). In conclusion, two liters of extra water intake for 2 weeks significantly increased daytime blood pressure and reduced a sense of vertigo in healthy individuals.
