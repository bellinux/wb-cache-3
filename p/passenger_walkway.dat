25|$|In 1913, the Public Service Commission {{planned to}} connect the Flushing line to the 42nd Street shuttle, {{just west of the}} Grand Central station. Some ramp work was built for this purpose, then {{converted}} to a <b>passenger</b> <b>walkway</b> that has been in use since 1916. In addition, there are two remaining sections of the old trolley loop that remain intact and are accessible to MTA personnel via the southbound track approximately 200 feet beyond the station. The third is between the tracks and is a pump room. Parts of the loop are being converted into CBTC circuit breaker rooms.|$|E
25|$|By the 1980s the {{original}} design, which had mobile lounges meet each plane, {{was no longer}} well-suited to Dulles' role as a hub airport. Instead, midfield concourses were added to allow passengers to walk between connecting flights without visiting the main terminal. Mobile lounges were still used for international flights and to transport passengers between the midfield concourses and the main terminal. An underground tunnel (consisting of a <b>passenger</b> <b>walkway</b> and moving sidewalks) which links the main terminal and Concourse B was opened in 2004. The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) began a renovation program for the airport including a new security mezzanine with more room for lines.|$|E
25|$|In 1913, the Public Service Commission {{planned a}} new {{platform}} for the shuttle, close to the Lexington Avenue Line station. The platform was constructed, {{but it was never}} used. The wall and roof of the old subway were removed at the curve just south of the old Grand Central station, and trackways were built continuing east under 42nd Street, to bring those two tracks into the new station with a narrow island platform between them. The unused trackways of the proposed shuttle platform were covered with wooden flooring in 1918, and the width of the station was finished up as a <b>passenger</b> <b>walkway</b> between the Lexington Avenue Line and Shuttle stations. The wooden flooring was replaced by concrete in 1946, and the former downtown express track between this station and Times Square–42nd Street was removed in 1975.|$|E
50|$|PSP's {{passenger}} terminal {{consists of three}} parts—the main building, the elevated Sonny Bono Concourse to the north, and a yet-unnamed concourse to the south. Airside, it has a unique open-air layout in that all <b>passenger</b> <b>walkways</b> connecting these structures are roofless.|$|R
50|$|There {{is another}} {{important}} station in Cologne, the Köln Messe/Deutz railway station across the river Rhine, just about 400 metres away from Köln Hauptbahnhof. The stations are linked by the Hohenzollern Bridge, a six-track railway bridge with <b>passenger</b> <b>walkways</b> on each side. Frequent local services connect the two stations.|$|R
25|$|There is {{a direct}} {{connection}} to Sheikh Rashid Terminal (Concourse C) located at the control tower structure through <b>passenger</b> <b>walkways.</b> There is also a 300-room hotel and health club including both five and four star rooms. Concourse B includes five aerobridges {{that are capable of}} handling the new Airbus A380.|$|R
500|$|Vestby Station (...) is {{a railway}} {{station on the}} Østfold Line located {{in the village of}} Vestby, Norway. It is served by {{commuter}} trains operated by the Norwegian State Railways running from Spikkestad over Oslo to Moss. The station opened in 1879, and was modernised in the early 1990s. It features a <b>passenger</b> <b>walkway</b> built in gluelam connecting its two platforms and a small parking lot with place for approximately 120 cars. The station serves about 160 passengers to Oslo each day.|$|E

30|$|It {{does not}} take into account the {{variation}} and state-dependent service time of the walkway (in reality, the walking/travel time of <b>passengers</b> on the <b>walkway</b> depends on the walking speed of passengers as well as on the number of <b>passengers</b> on the <b>walkway).</b>|$|R
5000|$|In May 2012, KITA (Korea International Trade Association) {{announced}} {{major renovation}} {{plans for the}} mall. It will spend [...] to the upgrade project. The renovation is needed to create <b>passenger</b> <b>walkways</b> between the new Bongeunsa Station on Seoul Subway Line 9, due for completion in 2014, with Samseong Station on Line 2. It was scheduled {{to start at the}} end of 2012 and complete by November 2014. The floor space is expected to increased to 173,025 m2 from its current 152,116 m2.|$|R

30|$|The {{alighting}} {{passenger flow}} from the train is considered. Nevertheless, the proposed approach can also deal with the flow of <b>passengers</b> toward the <b>walkway</b> from entrance gate of the urban rail transit station.|$|R
30|$|Mean area {{occupied}} per passenger ES on {{the walkway}} is ES = LW/n, {{from which we}} can see that mean area occupied per passenger will vary with the walkway width W. Therefore, the mean area occupied per <b>passenger</b> on the <b>walkway</b> can be expressed as a function of W, that is, ES(W) = LW/n.|$|R
3000|$|Before {{developing}} the simulation-based optimization approach, we first verify {{the accuracy of}} our PH/PH(n)/C/C DES model. For this purpose, the simulation tests with different passenger arrival rate and squared coefficient of variation are performed and compared to the PH/PH(n)/C/C analytical model [10] The peak passengers arrival rate λ are taken as 0.21, 0.34, 0.4 0.67 1.25, 1.79 (ped/s) with squared coefficient of variation of arrival interval (c_a^ 2) 3.24, 4.29, 2.36 1.82 2.05, 2.91, respectively, that are according to actual conditions of urban rail transit station. A 30  ×  2  m 2 horizontal urban rail transit station walkway is considered for all the experiments. The three representative points for the walking speed on the walkway are given as ([...] ν_ 1 = 1.50, δ_ 1 = 0.50), ([...] ν_a = 0.64, δ_a = 0.21) and ([...] ν_b = 0.25, δ_b = 0.08), respectively [3]. The three performance measures of the walkway such as mean number of <b>passengers</b> on <b>walkway</b> E[N], mean area per passenger ‘ES’ and mean time spent by <b>passenger</b> on the <b>walkway</b> E[T] are calculated. The results of PH/PH(n)/C/C DES model are obtained after 10 replications with the simulation time of 20, 000 time units. The PH/PH(n)/C/C DES model results are compared to the PH/PH(n)/C/C analytical queuing model. It is observed {{that the difference between}} PH/PH(n)/C/C DES model and PH/PH(n)/C/C analytical model is very small. The mean relative error of PH/PH(n)/C/C DES model is 2.1 [...]...|$|R
5000|$|The {{station is}} {{connected}} to [...] with a direct <b>passenger</b> <b>walkway</b> linking the two stations (replacing an earlier such link) that was opened in July 2015. This walkway means passengers {{do not have to}} exit on to the street in order to continue their onward journey.|$|E
50|$|A fire, {{caused by}} a cutting torch, led to $500,000 worth of damage to the {{terminal}} in December, 1981. It destroyed part of the <b>passenger</b> <b>walkway</b> and a wingwall, prior to being contained by terminal staff, firefighters and the approaching Queen of Nanaimo, which utilized its hoses {{to help keep the}} blaze at bay.|$|E
50|$|Work {{started on}} a new {{terminal}} building in 2002, which became operational on 19 April 2004. The old terminal was demolished in May 2004 to make space for additional aircraft stands and a <b>passenger</b> <b>walkway</b> from the new terminal. The new terminal {{was designed to be}} able to handle about 1.25 million passengers per year. In 2013, 886,396 passengers used the airport, with 49,403 aircraft movements.|$|E
2500|$|Along {{with the}} {{standard}} customs and immigration facilities, Terminal 1 also contains special customs [...] "B" [...] checkpoints along the international arrivals <b>walkway.</b> <b>Passengers</b> that are connecting from an international or trans-border arrival to another international (non-U.S.) departure in Terminal 1 {{go to one of}} these checkpoints for passport control and immigration checks, then are immediately directed to Pier F for departure. This alleviates the need to recheck bags, pass through security screening, and relieves congestion in the primary customs hall.|$|R
30|$|The {{increase}} in passenger arrival rate from 5000 to 10, 000 ped/h results in almost doubling the design width {{for all the}} peak-hour factors and LOS. The {{increase in}} width value is quite obvious because the higher arrival rates cause high density of <b>passengers</b> on the <b>walkway</b> resulting in the slow movement of passengers and congestion. Therefore, {{in order to avoid}} the congestion and the blocking, the walkway width should be more for higher arrival rates to provide safe passage for the passengers to travel.|$|R
50|$|Rani Mangammal (Queen Mangammal) (Reign 1689—1704) {{was ruled}} Madurai Nayakar Dynasty as a 11th ruler from Madurai. She is well renowned queen for {{development}} of infrastructure like roads, <b>walkways,</b> <b>passengers</b> rest house, irrigation & plantation even for small and remote villages which are very far from capital of Madurai. Rani Mangammal was an efficient and popular ruler and her memory is cherished even today {{in the rural areas}} of the district. Mangammal worked industriously at civil administration, trade and industry paying special attention to irrigation and communications.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the second}} floor {{reserved}} for food and catering {{will have to wait}} at least half a year to have electricity connection after the pier's operation commenced. Passengers questioned that the new walkway to the new pier was too narrow and insufficient for the passenger flow during peak hours. The Civil Engineering and Development Department replied that the new <b>passenger</b> <b>walkway</b> was designed to accommodate the passenger flow generated by the current ferry line.|$|E
5000|$|As for the West Rail Line, an {{extension}} has been opened to East Tsim Sha Tsui station, with a sub-surface <b>passenger</b> <b>walkway</b> to Tsim Sha Tsui Station on the Tsuen Wan Line. All three MTR stations {{in this district}} sees (and will see) some trains terminating. East Tsim Sha Tsui used to be served by the East Rail Line until it {{was transferred to the}} West Rail Line in 2009. Now the West Rail Line and East Rail Line interchange at Hung Hom.|$|E

500|$|Several stairs lead {{down from}} {{sidewalk}} level to walkways {{on either side}} of the turnpike, which themselves lead to one of the mezzanines. Automobiles and buses were formerly allowed to drop off and pick up <b>passengers</b> along those <b>walkways</b> (similar to stations on the IND Concourse Line), but car access is currently blocked. This was stopped because the cars caused traffic backups. The underpass is graded east to allow for natural drainage. The lower level contains the subway tracks, which are located about [...] below the underpass that carries the turnpike.|$|R
30|$|Besides urban {{rail transit}} station walkway, the {{proposed}} method {{can also be}} applied to the stairs facilities in urban rail transit stations as well as corridors and stairs in other buildings such as shopping malls, stadiums and hospitals. The proposed method can be easily extended to a queuing network to design different service facilities such as a network of walkways and stairs. The alighting passenger flow from the train is considered. Nevertheless, the proposed approach can also deal with the flow of <b>passengers</b> toward the <b>walkway</b> from entrance gate of the urban rail transit station.|$|R

50|$|The Stranraer {{terminal}} {{was constructed}} in 1991 and had one <b>passenger</b> <b>walkway.</b> The terminal was used up until April 2000 when services moved to Troon. The terminal building was demolished soon after vacation of the harbour, the walkway remaining until 2005. The harbour area which SeaCat once occupied at Stranraer has since been developed into a marina {{as part of the}} waterfront redevelopment being carried out by Dumfries and Galloway council. As of November 2008 the marina has been opened and currently is home to many small pleasure craft.|$|E

25|$|Between 1998 and 2002, in {{preparation}} for the 2002 Commonwealth Games, the station underwent a £100 million redevelopment. The glass roof of the trainshed, which is Grade II listed was re-glazed and re-painted. A new main entrance and enlarged concourse with a mezzanine level, designed by BDP, replaced the 1960s structure which had become insufficient for the number of <b>passengers.</b> A moving <b>walkway</b> was installed to take passengers from the concourse to platforms 13 and 14 at the far south end of the station which involves a long walk. Another entrance was also created on Fairfield Street to access a new taxi rank and drop-off point for cars.|$|R

50|$|Since {{the mid-19th}} century, Head house is most {{commonly}} encountered as an American railroad {{term for the}} part of a train station which does not house the tracks and platforms. Outside America, the same part of a station is known as the station building. In the context of rail transport, the term head house usually refers to the portion of a large passenger terminal which contains the ticket counters, waiting rooms, toilets and baggage facilities. It might also include the <b>passenger</b> concourses and <b>walkways</b> between the platforms and other facilities. The head house at Philadelphia's Reading Terminal, which fronts a two level shed with tracks and platforms paced above a covered market, combined both the older and newer meanings of the word.|$|R
