500|$|Many {{critics of}} the time and since have {{declared}} it Cagney's best film, drawing parallels between Cohan and Cagney; they both began their careers in vaudeville, struggled for years before reaching the peak of their profession, were surrounded with family and married early, and both had a wife who was happy to sit back while he went on to stardom. The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won three, including Cagney's for Best Actor. In his acceptance speech, Cagney said, [...] "I've always maintained that in this business, you're {{only as good as the}} other fellow thinks you are. It's nice to know that you <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> did a good job. And don't forget that it was a good part, too." ...|$|E

The song's success ultimately benefited Milian's {{career as a}} performer; she explained, [...] "I never realized that show would give me so much exposure. It's great because people have grown with me, even with that damn song. Didn’t know {{so many people were}} watching Kim Possible like that. Because of that song, it actually inspired me to do my own musical animated artist because a lot of <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was Kim Possible." [...] Milian has yet to perform the song live in concert but has expressed interest in recording a remix for fans. [...] "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] was the first song Lerios and Gabriel wrote together, and the songwriting duo has since gone on to collaborate on both scoring and writing songs for several other major television networks and programs.|$|E

500|$|Describing {{himself as}} a child, Cooper has said: [...] "I never lived the life of 'Oh, you're so good-looking'. <b>People</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was a girl when I was little, because I looked like a girl—maybe because my mother would keep my hair really long". He excelled at basketball, and enjoyed cooking: [...] "I used to have buddies come over after {{kindergarten}} and I'd cook them food. I prided myself in taking whatever was in the fridge and turning it into lasagna." [...] He initially wanted to attend a military academy and move to Japan to become a ninja. At an early age, his father introduced him to films like The Elephant Man, which inspired him to be an actor. Cooper says that his parents were initially apprehensive of his career choice, but they eventually changed their perceptions when they saw Cooper play the part of Joseph Merrick in {{an excerpt from the}} play The Elephant Man.|$|E

In a 2001 interview, he said, [...] "Polite conversation has never been one of my strong points.

2500|$|Although {{he might}} by today's terms {{be called a}} seamer, back then Shaw was {{fundamentally}} a length bowler, holding a line on or just outside the off-stump: certainly, he often employed the off-theory, {{with as many as}} eight fielders patrolling the offside. His run-up was made up of six rapid, economical steps, but, according to the man himself, [...] "I really used to bowl faster than <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> did, and I could make the ball break both ways, but not much. In my opinion, length and variation of pace constitute the secret of successful bowling." [...] However, although he was regarded almost universally as [...] "the high priest of length", he and Ted Peate together poured scorn all over suggestions that they were capable of [...] "hitting the spot" [...] with nearly every delivery (as was the common perception).|$|E

By singing along to those records that's how I learned how to sing falsetto. [...] I would sing along to songs like 'I'm Always Chasing Rainbows,' 'I'll Remember April' and 'Day by Day'." [...] He declared in 1966 that his greatest interest was to expand modern vocal harmony, owing his fascination with voice to the Four Freshmen, which he considered a [...] "groovy sectional sound". He added, [...] "The harmonies that we [...] are able to produce give us a uniqueness which is really the only important thing you can put into records – some quality that no one else has got. I love peaks in a song – and enhancing them on the control panel. Most of all, I love the human voice for its own sake."

I still feel good, and I think because of all that I’ll never be complacent. I feel like I want to prove myself even more, and prove a lot of people wrong. Everything happens for a reason, though." [...] Titans quarterback Kerry Collins said of Ringer [...] "He is a good football player. Some guys are just football players, and Javon Ringer is a football player. He is patient, remarkably patient for a rookie running back. He sees blocking schemes well and has a good feel for when to cut back and when not to cut back. He has shown a lot of moves. I think the kid has a bright future.” Titans linebacker Keith Bulluck also said “He has an understanding of the game, you can tell by the cuts he makes at times. The way he runs, and the way that he pays attention. You don’t see the coaches get on him much for messing up, so that’s big for a rookie. I’ve been impressed.’’ Tackle Michael Roos also added in, “He sees the block in progress, He can tell when a block is going to be made and he trusts that it will be made, so sometimes he is cutting before the block has even been made. You don’t see that a lot. A few people have that, and he has definitely got it. Hopefully he can get reps with the (first team) a little more and see where it goes from there.’’ ...|$|E

60|$|In that village {{there was}} a social {{equality}} which, if not absolute, was as nearly so as can ever be in a competitive civilization; and I could have suffered no slight in the general esteem for giving up a profession {{and going back to}} a trade; if I was despised at all it was because I had thrown away the chance of material advancement; I dare say some <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was a fool to do that. No one, indeed, could have imagined the rapture it was to do it, or what a load rolled from my shoulders when I dropped the law from them.

My reading had given me criterions {{different from those of the}} simple life of our village, and I did not flatter myself that my calling would have been thought one of great social dignity in the world where I hoped some day to make my living. My convictions were all democratic, but at heart I am afraid I was a snob, and was unworthy of the honest work which I ought to have felt it an honor to do; this, whatever we falsely pretend to the contrary, is the frame of every one who aspires beyond the work of his hands.

40|$|Introduction: There is {{a common}} view that social deficits in {{schizophrenia}} reflect a general impairment of social intelligence. This view fails to distinguish between knowledge and process, in particular, the knowledge of social rules versus the cognitive processes for inferring other <b>people’s</b> <b>thoughts</b> (<b>i.</b> e. ‘‘theory of mind’’: ToM). Aims: This study used a novel Social Judgment Task to assess reasoning about social rules and reasoning concerning other <b>people’s</b> <b>thoughts</b> in schizophrenia. We predicted social-rule reasoning to be intact in schizophrenia while reasoning about other <b>people’s</b> <b>thoughts</b> would be impaired. Methods: Forty-three patients and 28 healthy controls, matched group-wise on years of age, gender-ratio and NART-estimated IQ, completed the Social Judgment Task and verbal and non-verbal tests of ToM. On the Social Judgment Task participants judged whether actions described in story vignettes were normal or unusual in the circumstances. These actions could be appropriate according to social norms, violations of social norms or socially inappropriate but understandable if story characters’ thoughts were taken into account. Results: Patients performed more poorly than controls on the verbal and the non-verbal ToM tasks. On the Social Judgment Task, the patients’ reasoning about social norms {{did not differ significantly}} fromthat of the controls, while the patients took less account of the story characters’ thoughts. These latter difficulties in the patients were associated with their performance deficits on the ToM tasks. Conclusions: Knowledge and reasoning concerning social norms is generally intact in schizophrenia while social cognition, in particular ToM, is impaired. 1 page(s...|$|R
