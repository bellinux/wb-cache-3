5|$|International {{fast-food}} restaurant chain Burger King and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's {{have had a}} variety of grilled chicken sandwiches in their <b>product</b> <b>portfolio</b> since 1990. The BK Broiler was the first iteration, {{and was one of}} the most successful product introductions in the fast food industry to that point in time. However sales dropped in the following two years, and the product was reformulated and renamed to the Chicken Whopper to align the product with the company's Whopper Sandwich. A change of ownership of Burger King in 2004 prompted another reformulation of the product into the BK Baguette product line that focused on a more health-oriented product. This new formulation proved unpopular and was replaced in 2005 with the TenderGrill chicken sandwich. The TenderGrill sandwich was introduced as part of a series of sandwiches designed to expand Burger King's menu with both more sophisticated, adult oriented fare and present a larger, meatier product that appealed to 24- to 36-year-old males. Burger King was the first major fast food chain to introduce a grilled chicken sandwich to the marketplace, beating rivals Wendy's by six months and McDonald's by four years. These two chains also went through a series of reformulations and naming schemes for their grilled chicken products.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, Gatorade re-branded {{a number}} of its products. Original Gatorade was {{initially}} re-labeled as Gatorade G. Gatorade Rain was re-labeled as No Excuses. Gatorade AM was re-labeled Shine On; Gatorade X-Factor was relabeled as Be Tough; and Gatorade Fierce was relabeled Bring It. However these names were short-lived, as a two-percent decline in market share in 2009 led to a broader repositioning of the entire line in 2010. Beginning in February 2010, the Gatorade <b>product</b> <b>portfolio</b> was re-positioned around what the company {{refers to as the}} G Series, categorizing varieties of its products into three main segments: before, during, and after athletic events.|$|E

25|$|The {{reasoning}} is increased activity leads to increased learning, {{which leads to}} lower costs, {{which can lead to}} lower prices, which can lead to increased market share, which can lead to increased profitability and market dominance. According to BCG, the most effective business strategy was one of striving for market dominance in this way. This was particularly true when a firm had an early leadership in market share. It was claimed that if you cannot get enough market share to be competitive, you should get out of that business and concentrate your resources where you can take advantage of experience effects and gain dominant market share. The BCG strategists developed <b>product</b> <b>portfolio</b> techniques like the BCG Matrix (in part) to manage this strategy.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} {{problems that}} arose with the Ashton-Tate merger were {{a large part}} of the fall. Ashton-Tate's <b>product</b> <b>portfolio</b> proved to be weak, with no provision for evolution into the GUI environment of Windows. Almost all product lines were discontinued. The consolidation of duplicate support and development offices was costly and disruptive. Worst of all, the highest revenue earner of the combined company was dBASE with no Windows version ready. Borland had an internal project to clone dBASE which was intended to run on Windows and was part of the strategy of the acquisition, but by late 1992 this was abandoned due to technical flaws and the company had to constitute a replacement team (the ObjectVision team, redeployed) headed by Bill Turpin to redo the job. Borland lacked the financial strength to project its marketing and move internal resources off other products to shore up the dBASE/W effort. Layoffs occurred in 1993 to keep the company afloat, the third instance of this in five years. By the time dBASE for Windows eventually shipped, the developer community had moved on to other products such as Clipper or FoxBase and dBASE never regained significant share of Ashton-Tate's former market. This happened against the backdrop of the rise in Microsoft's combined Office product marketing.|$|E
500|$|In the 1990s CSG {{introduced}} the ACSR (Advanced Customer Service Representative) system. An extension to ACSR called ProfitNow! {{was introduced in}} 2003. ProfitNow! used a consumer's account data to advise customer service representatives on {{the likelihood of a}} caller cancelling their service or buying a new product. It was later turned into an online system with a user interface similar to Microsoft Windows at CSG.net. CSG purchased the Kenan FX software from Lucent Technologies in 2002. Kenan software managed billing and ordering and provided middle-ware to help various customer service and billing products integrate with each other. CSG NextGen was introduced for international markets, with support for multiple languages. In March 2014, CSG added a cybersecurity suite to its <b>product</b> <b>portfolio,</b> under the name CSG Invotas. The company released CSG Ascendon, a digital platform for communications service providers, in March 2015. The platform uses content monetization and delivery systems without making excessive changes to existing infrastructure. In November 2015 the Invotas unit was spun off into a separate entity.

40|$|The paper {{demonstrates}} {{application of}} the latent Markov model for assessing developments by individuals through stages of a process. This approach is applied by using a database on ownership of 12 financial products and various demographic variables. The latent Markov model derives latent classes, representing household <b>product</b> <b>portfolios,</b> and shows the relationship between class membership and household demographics. The analysis provides insight into switching between the latent classes, reflecting developments of individual household <b>product</b> <b>portfolios,</b> {{and the effects of}} demographics on such switches. Based on this, we formulate equations to predict future acquisitions of financial products. The model accurately predicts which product a specific household unit acquires next, for most of the products. © 2007 Royal Statistical Society...|$|R

2500|$|On April 21, 2005, AMD {{released}} the first dual core Opteron, an x86-based server CPU. A month later, AMD {{released the}} Athlon 64 X2, the first desktop-based {{dual core processor}} family. In May 2007, AMD abandoned the string [...] "64" [...] in its dual-core desktop product branding, becoming Athlon X2, downplaying the significance of 64-bit computing in its processors. Further updates involved improvements to the microarchitecture, and a shift of target market from mainstream desktop systems to value dual-core desktop systems. In 2008, AMD started to release dual-core Sempron processors exclusively in China, branded as the Sempron 2000 series, with lower HyperTransport speed and smaller L2 cache. Thus AMD completed its dual-core <b>product</b> <b>portfolio</b> for each market segment.|$|E

2500|$|The content-sourcing {{competence}} means {{acquisition of}} high-quality information and/or entertainment content for content production. Especially {{the production of}} exclusive content leads to unique competitive advantage. Content-creation competence {{is one of the}} most important core competences in most media enterprises. Media enterprises with content-creation competences are, for example, especially good at realizing social trends and implementing them into their media products, making them highly attractive for the customers. The product development competence is the qualification for a <b>product</b> <b>portfolio</b> with a steady flow of revenues.In order to achieve this, media enterprises have to be able to develop promising media products and to assess their marketability. The promotion competence is specifically relevant for media products belonging to the film, book or music categories as these are individual products. Here a different promotion strategy than promotion of brand identity is needed. Achieving public attention and thus a better market position for media products constitutes the promotion competence. [...] Media enterprises with cross-media utilization competences can provide content to the recipients in a timely manner, in the desired amount and via the right channel. Finally the technology competence refers to the employment of modern information and communication technology for the creation and marketing of content.|$|E

40|$|A recent {{development}} in marketing research concerns {{the incorporation of}} dynamics in consumer segmentation. This paper extends the latent class Markov model, a suitable technique for conducting dynamic segmentation, {{in order to facilitate}} lead generation. We demonstrate the application of the latent Markov model for these purposes using a database containing information on the ownership of twelve financial products and demographics for explaining (changes in) consumer <b>product</b> <b>portfolios.</b> Data were collected in four bi-yearly measurement waves in which a total of 7676 households participated. The proposed latent class Markov model defines dynamic segments on the basis of consumer <b>product</b> <b>portfolios</b> and shows the relationship between the dynamic segments and demographics. The paper demonstrates that the dynamic segmentation resulting from the latent class Markov model is applicable for lead generation. ...|$|R
