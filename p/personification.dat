40|$|This paper surveys <b>personifications</b> on Vespasian 2 ̆ 7 s coinage {{in terms}} of their novelty and significance. It finds that there is more novelty than has been allowed, {{especially}} in the proliferation of <b>personifications</b> following Nero 2 ̆ 7 s demise and in the number of unprecedented legends. Many of the <b>personifications</b> have a traditional character, so that the overall message seems to be one of continuity with the Augustan model of a 2 ̆ 7 good 2 ̆ 7 emperor. Finally, among the particular themes which are promoted by the <b>personifications,</b> it seems that there is a fundamental desire to confirm the stability and strength of the succession to Vespasian in the person of his two sons, Titus and Domitian...|$|R

5|$|In {{one of the}} interludes of The Loves of the Plants, {{the voice}} of the Poet, which would seem to be Darwin's voice as well, argues that poetry is meant to appeal to the senses, {{particularly}} vision. Darwin's primary tool for accomplishing this was <b>personification.</b> Darwin's personifications were often based on the classical allusions embedded with Linnaeus's own naming system. However, they were not meant to conjure up images of gods or heroes; rather, the anthropomorphized images of the plants depict more ordinary images. They also stimulate the readers' imaginations to assist them in learning the material and allow Darwin to argue that the plants he is discussing are animate, living things—just like humans. Darwin's use of <b>personification</b> suggests that plants are more akin to humans than the reader might at first assume; his emphasis on the continuities between mankind and plantkind contributes to the evolutionary theme that runs throughout the poem.|$|E
5|$|Of Antisthenes' Aspasia {{only two}} or three {{quotations}} are extant. This dialogue contains much slander, but also anecdotes pertaining to Pericles' biography. Antisthenes appears to have attacked not only Aspasia, but the entire family of Pericles, including his sons. The philosopher believes that the great statesman chose the life of pleasure over virtue. Thus, Aspasia is presented as the <b>personification</b> of the life of sexual indulgence.|$|E

5|$|Statius {{mentions}} Orion {{four times}} in his Thebaïd; twice as the constellation, a <b>personification</b> of storm, but twice as the ancestor of Dryas of Tanagra, one of the defenders of Thebes. The very late Greek epic poet Nonnus mentions the oxhide story in brief, while listing the Hyrians in his Catalogue of the Boeotian army of Dionysius.|$|E
5|$|According to Lafcadio Hearn, a {{butterfly}} {{was seen in}} Japan as the <b>personification</b> of a person's soul; whether they be living, dying, or already dead. One Japanese superstition says that if {{a butterfly}} enters your guest room and perches behind the bamboo screen, the person whom you most love is coming to see you. Large numbers of butterflies are viewed as bad omens. When Taira no Masakado was secretly preparing for his famous revolt, there appeared in Kyoto so vast a swarm of butterflies that the people were frightened— thinking the apparition to be a portent of coming evil.|$|E

5|$|Hope {{is closely}} related to Idle Child of Fancy, {{completed}} by Watts in 1885, which also shows a <b>personification</b> of one of the traditional virtues (in this case Love) sitting on a cloud-shrouded globe. In traditional depictions of the virtues, Love was shown blindfolded while Hope was not; in Hope and Idle Child Watts reversed this imagery, depicting Love looking straight ahead and Hope as blind. It {{is believed to be the}} first time a European artist depicted Hope as blind.|$|E
5|$|Iridium was {{discovered}} in 1803 among insoluble impurities in natural platinum. Smithson Tennant, the primary discoverer, named iridium for the Greek goddess Iris, <b>personification</b> of the rainbow, because of the striking and diverse colors of its salts. Iridium {{is one of the}} rarest elements in Earth's crust, with annual production and consumption of only three tonnes. 191Ir and 193Ir are the only two naturally occurring isotopes of iridium, as well as the only stable isotopes; the latter is the more abundant of the two.|$|E

5|$|Orion served several {{roles in}} ancient Greek culture. The {{story of the}} adventures of Orion, the hunter, is the one on which {{we have the most}} {{evidence}} (and even on that not very much); he is also the <b>personification</b> of the constellation of the same name; he was venerated as a hero, in the Greek sense, in the region of Boeotia; and there is one etiological passage which says that Orion was responsible for the present shape of the Strait of Sicily.|$|E
5|$|Suggestions {{to explain}} the mythical blue men include {{that they may be}} a <b>personification</b> of the sea, or {{originate}} with the Picts, whose painted bodies may have given the impression of men raising themselves out of the water if they were seen crossing the sea in boats that might have resembled kayaks. The genesis of the blue men may alternatively lie with the North African slaves the Vikings took with them to Scotland, where they spent the winter months close to the Shiant Isles in the Minch.|$|E
