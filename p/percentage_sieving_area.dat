40|$|Phloem, a {{plant tissue}} {{responsible}} for long-distance molecular transport, harbours specific junctions, <b>sieve</b> <b>areas,</b> between the conducting cells. To date, {{little is known}} about the molecular framework related to the biogenesis of these <b>sieve</b> <b>areas.</b> Here we identify mutations at the CHER 1 /AtCTL 1 locus of Arabidopsis thaliana. The mutations cause several phenotypic abnormalities, including reduced pore density and altered pore structure in the <b>sieve</b> <b>areas</b> associated with impaired phloem function. CHER 1 encodes a member of a poorly characterized choline transporter-like protein family in plants and animals. We show that CHER 1 facilitates choline transport, localizes to the trans-Golgi network, and during cytokinesis is associated with the phragmoplast. Consistent with its function in the elaboration of the <b>sieve</b> <b>areas,</b> CHER 1 has a sustained, polar localization in the forming sieve plates. Our results indicate that the regulation of choline levels is crucial for phloem development and conductivity in plants...|$|R

Sieve cells are typically associated with gymnosperms, because angiosperms have the more derived sieve tube members and companion cells in their phloem.

In this paper, a new approach of a flexible, polyimide-based sieve electrode is presented. Monolithically integrated fixation flaps offer the opportunity to directly fix the sieve implant on a transected nerve without the need for a guidance channel. The sieve has been fabricated with a thickness of 10 m and chronically implanted between the transected ends of the sciatic nerve of rats.

2500|$|Sieve {{elements}} are {{the type of}} cell {{that are responsible for}} transporting sugars throughout the plant. [...] At maturity they lack a nucleus and have very few organelles, so they rely on companion cells or albuminous cells for most of their metabolic needs. Sieve tube cells do contain vacuoles and other organelles, such as ribosomes, before they mature, but these generally migrate to the cell wall and dissolve at maturity; this ensures there is little to impede the movement of fluids. One of the few organelles they do contain at maturity is the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, which {{can be found at the}} plasma membrane, often nearby the plasmodesmata that connect them to their companion or albuminous cells. All sieve cells have groups of pores at their ends that grow from modified and enlarged plasmodesmata, called <b>sieve</b> <b>areas.</b> The pores are reinforced by platelets of a polysaccharide called callose.|$|R

The development of new cultivars of barley is therefore more focused on improving of abiotic stress tolerance to drought, as well as on maintaining of good health status, appropriate yield levels and quality parameters. This work was aimed at evaluation of barley cv. Tadmor, which is specifically adapted to drought and can be potentially used as a source of drought tolerance in barley breeding programmes. F 5 generation lines derived from reciprocal crosses between cv. Tadmor and cv. Jersey (advanced European spring malting barley) together with parent cultivars were cultivated at two sites (Brno, Žabčice). The assessment was aimed at traits associated with yield (thousand grain weight - TGW, <b>percentage</b> of <b>sieving</b> fraction over 2. 0 mm, grain yield per plant) and quality (protein and starch content). The effect of water-limited conditions at Žabčice site was demonstrated particularly in the TGW and the <b>percentage</b> of <b>sieving</b> fraction over 2. 0 mm, while the lines from Tadmor x Jersey cross sustained the stress significantly better than those from Jersey x Tadmor cross. The lines grown in Žabčice reached in average a higher level of protein content and a lower level of starch content. The significant effect of genotype was detected only in protein content and was non-significant for starch. The reaction of selected lines on osmotic stress was studied in and independent experiment under controlled conditions. The plant stress reaction was evaluated according to changes in osmotic potential in leaves and accumulation of proline. Lines with Tadmor as a female parent showed higher values of osmotic potential in comparison with those derived from the reciprocal cross. The increase in osmotic potential under stress was strongly associated with the content of proline. The last part was focused on evaluation of susceptibility to powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis. The symptoms of powdery mildew on experimental lines were assessed in field and the lines, which were classified as resistant/susceptible, were further analysed for the presence of mlo allele.

During an 8 -hr period, 2. 7 % of the translocate or 0. 38 μg carbon/min was accumulated per cm petiole. Material was stored mainly as sucrose and as compounds insoluble in 80 % ethanol. The minimum peak velocity of translocation approached an average of 54 cm/hr as the specific activity of the 14 CO 2 pulse was progressively increased. The ratio of cross sectional area required for translocation to actual <b>sieve</b> tube <b>area</b> in the petiole was 1. 2.

40|$|Abstract. The Marshall Stability {{of asphalt}} {{concrete}} {{is one of}} the most important parameters in mix design and quality control. This property depends on many factors such as gradation, percentage of crushed aggregates, asphalt content and construction quality.

The percentage of crushed aggregates; the <b>percentage</b> passing through <b>sieve</b> numbers 200, 50, 30, 8, 4 and 1 / 2 inch, and the percentage of asphalt content are considered as network inputs and Marshall Stability as the network output. In the rst stage, the maximum generalization ability of each network with a specied number of neurons in the hidden layer is determined. Comparing these maximum values reveals that the network with 8 neurons in the hidden layer has the maximum generalization ability. In the second stage, the variation of Marshall Stability with asphalt content is simulated by applying a sensitivity analysis to the network with the maximum generalization ability.

Similar fire histories are reconstructed from these three approaches for boreal lake sediment cores, using locally defined thresholds. Here, we test the same approach for a montane Mediterranean lake in which taphonomical processes might differ from boreal lakes through fragmentation of charcoal particles. The Mediterranean charcoal series are characterized by highly variable charcoal accumulation rates. Results there indicate that the three proxies do not provide comparable fire histories. The differences are attributable to charcoal fragmentation. This could be linked to fire type (crown or surface fires) or taphonomical processes, including charcoal transportation in the catchment area or in the sediment. The lack of correlation between the concentration of charcoal and of mineral matter suggests that fragmentation is not linked to erosion. Reconstructions based on charcoal area are more robust and stable than those based on fragment counts. Area-based reconstructions should therefore be used instead of the particle-counting method when fragmentation may influence the fragment abundance...|$|R

For these reasons four mesoporous molecular sieves (SBA- 15, SBA- 16, MCM- 41, and MCM- 48) with different structures and textural properties have been chosen. To show the possible application of mesoporous molecular sieves as a CO 2 adsorbent, magnesium oxide, and potassium carbonate were incorporated into SBA- 15, SBA- 16, and MCM- 48 silicas.

40|$|The {{extent to}} which wheat grain growth is {{dependent}} on transport pool solute concentration was investigated {{by the use of}} illumination and partial grain removal to vary solute concentrations in the sieve tube and endosperm cavity saps of the wheat ear (Triticum aestivum L.). Short-term grain growth rates were estimated indirectly from the product of phloem <b>area,</b> <b>sieve</b> tube sap concentration, and 32 P translocation velocity. On a per grain basis, calculated rates of mass transport through the peduncle were fairly constant over a substantial range in other transport parameters (i. e. velocity, concentration, phloem area, and grain number). The rates were about 40 % higher than expected; this probably reflects some unavoidable bias on faster-moving tracer in the velocity estimates. Sieve tube sap concentration increased in all experiments (by 20 to 64 %), with a concomitant decline in velocity (to as low as 8 % of the initial value). Endosperm cavity sucrose concentration also increased in all experiments, but cavity sap osmolality and total amino acid concentration remained nearly constant. No evidence was found for an increase in the rate of mass transport per grain through the peduncle in response to the treatments. This apparent unresponsiveness of grain growth rate to increased cavity sap sucrose concentration conflicts with earlier in vitro endosperm studies showing that sucrose uptake increased with increasing external sucrose concentration up to 150 to 200 millimolar...|$|R

40|$|It was {{recently}} demonstrated that, infiltration into mountain-tilled soils with highly stable microaggregates, increases with increasing slope gradient. In this work we investigate {{the processes that}} underpin this phenomenon by means of field experiments and modelling. The study area is located in northern Laos. Rainfall simulations were conducted in two 1 -m 2 plots using a portable field simulator. The drop size distribution and kinetic energy were similar to that occurring {{on the occasion of}} tropical downpours. Soils exhibited a clay loam texture and very similar organic matter contents across experimental plots, but differed greatly in slope gradient (30 % and 75 %). Runoff water samples were collected at intervals ranging from 1 to 3 min, depending on the runoff intensity. Plots microtopography was measured before and after rainfall simulations using an automatic surface roughness meter on a 1 -cm grid. High-resolution bulk density images were obtained from soil slices using a standard X-ray generator. Final infiltration rates of 6 and 21 mm h− 1; soil detachment of 667 and 310 g m− 2; surface lowering due to soil loss of 0. 82 and 0. 38 mm; surface lowering due to compaction of 1. 21 and 0. 90 mm; <b>percentage</b> <b>area</b> with <b>sieving</b> crust of 36 % and 90 %; percentage area with erosion crust of 63 % and 0 %; were obtained for the 30 % and 75 % slopes, respectively. Three main conclusions can be drawn from this work: (1) high intensity rainfall can rapidly transform soil surface features of steep bare soil; (2) on steeper slopes, the micro-relief tends to form micro-terraces much more pervious and less erodible than the ripple-like roughness that formed on gentler slopes; and (3) there was a more pronounced lowering of the soil surface due to compaction and denser microlayers on gentler slopes. The latter conclusion confirms the hypothesis that higher effective rainfall intensity is responsible for the formation of less permeable erosion crusts under 30 % slope gradients while more permeable structural crusts develop under 75 % slope gradients. The runoff results were modelled with the Green and Ampt model which accounts for time evolution of soil hydraulic conductivity. This modelling shows that soil is undoubtedly non homogeneous, evolves with time and that infiltration kinetics is slower and soil permeability greater for the 75 % slope...|$|R

Aiming {{to analyze}} the {{environmental}} problems caused by use of batteries, we examined the Brazilian legislation on the matter and investigate what actions taken by retailers and manufacturers {{to the end of}} life of these products. It was found that for the materialization of this legislation is urgently needed effective monitoring, as well as a campaign of collective awareness of the problem. It was found that the only existing collection structure, although weak, is directed to the batteries of mobile phones, for the other types used in various equipment, it was noted that there is a real collection structure. Aiming at establishing a possible route for treatment of Ni- Cd, was it characterization. Therefore, initially, some batteries were dismantled by hand for the separation of internal components and understanding of its construction. The constituents of these batteries were characterized by chemical analysis by fluorescence, atomic absorption, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy with analysis of micro-regions, <b>sieve</b> analysis, specific <b>area</b> of analysis and thermogravimetric analysis. Using the factorial modeling of the leaching process has been defined the optimal parameters for leaching of the electrodes of these batteries, as follows: 14. 5 mL/g, 6. 2 mol/L and 80. 5 oC, resulting in 98 % yield. Based on the determination of the parameres of extraction, it was possible to propose an initial scheme for the separation of the metals of interest concerning the Ni-Cd battery...|$|R
