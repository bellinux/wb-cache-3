5|$|Apart {{from its}} long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back {{differentiate}} the hartebeest from other antelopes. The hartebeest shares several physical traits with the sassabies (genus Damaliscus), {{such as an}} elongated and narrow face, {{the shape of the}} horns, the pelage texture and colour, and the terminal tuft of the tail. The wildebeest have more specialised skull and horn features than the hartebeest. The hartebeest exhibits sexual dimorphism, but only slightly, as both sexes bear horns and have similar body masses. The degree of sexual dimorphism varies by subspecies. Males are 8% heavier than females in Swayne's and Lichtenstein's hartebeest, and 23% heavier in the red hartebeest. In one study, the highest dimorphism was found in skull weight. Another study concluded that the length of the breeding season is a good <b>predictor</b> of dimorphism in pedicle (the bony structures from which the horns grow) height and skull weight, and the best <b>predictor</b> of the horn circumference.|$|E

In this paper we propose a Bayesian solution for sufficient dimension reduction. We directly model the response density in terms of the sufficient <b>predictors</b> using a finite mixture model.

5|$|Homosexual men {{tended to}} have had their first {{homosexual}} encounter at a younger age, {{and were more likely}} to have their first encounters with friends or acquaintances rather than strangers. The data did not support the idea that homosexual males are likely to have been seduced by older men. Homosexual activity involving genital contact in childhood was connected to adult homosexuality, though only weakly; homosexual arousal during childhood or adolescence was a stronger <b>predictor</b> of adult homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood was a moderate <b>predictor</b> of adult heterosexuality. Phenomena associated with sexual maturation, such as the age of first ejaculation, did not seem to be important, and neither did parental attitudes toward sex. Respondents' opportunities to engage in sex with persons of the opposite or the same sex did not seem to be an important influence on the sexual preference they developed, and sexual experiences with persons of both the same and the opposite sex were common among both homosexuals and heterosexuals. Sexual feelings appeared to be more important than sexual behavior as an indicator of adult sexual preference.|$|E

25|$|Principal {{component}} regression (PCR) is {{used when}} the number of <b>predictor</b> variables is large, or when strong correlations exist among the <b>predictor</b> variables.

While it often works well in practice, there is no general theoretical reason that the most informative linear function of the <b>predictor</b> variables should lie among the dominant principal components of the multivariate distribution of the <b>predictor</b> variables. The partial least squares regression is the extension of the PCR method which does not suffer from the mentioned deficiency.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{prediction}} of query performance {{is an interesting}} and important issue in Information Retrieval (IR). Current <b>predictors</b> involve the use of relevance scores, which are time-consuming to compute. Therefore, current <b>predictors</b> are not very suitable for practical applications. In this paper, we study a set of <b>predictors</b> of query performance, which can be generated prior to the retrieval process. The linear and non-parametric correlations of the <b>predictors</b> with query performance are thoroughly assessed on the TREC disk 4 and disk 5 (minus CR) collections. According to the results, some of the proposed <b>predictors</b> have significant correlation with query performance, showing that these <b>predictors</b> can be useful to infer query performance in practical applications. ...|$|R

The {{primary goal}} of this {{research}} is to identify <b>predictors</b> of work interference with family (WIF) and their subsequent relationship to WIF in 72 female, married participants. Several distal <b>predictors</b> (managerial support, role autonomy, and hours worked) have been well-documented as <b>predictors</b> of WIF. Proximal <b>predictors</b> (balance of power, division of labor and egalitarianism) were also studied. Results indicate that among workplace (distal) <b>predictors</b> managerial support and hours worked continued to act as <b>predictors</b> of WIF and relationship (proximal) <b>predictors</b> balance of power and percentage of home duties also contributed to understanding overall Work Family Conflict. Implications for these findings indicate that working mothers continue to seek a balance between their family and work responsibilities and entities who support this consideration should continue to search for ways to champion these efforts.
