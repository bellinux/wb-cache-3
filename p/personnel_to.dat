40|$|This paper {{presents}} a model based on linguistic {{value for the}} transform from qualified <b>personnel</b> resource <b>to</b> qualified <b>personnel</b> capital. It is important to transform from qualified <b>personnel</b> resource <b>to</b> qualified <b>personnel</b> capital for transferring the mode of economic increase in many countries. The model of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is established to explain the method of comprehensive benefit-evaluation for the transform from qualified <b>personnel</b> resource <b>to</b> qualified <b>personnel</b> capital. However, the model based on linguistic value {{is better than the}} fuzzy comprehensive evaluation to explain people’s habit of thought...|$|R
30|$|For example, {{rather than}} {{competing}} with capital resources (say £ 5 M), the organisation’s competing resources {{may be in}} terms of roles assigned <b>to</b> <b>personnels</b> in the organisation.
