25|$|Power supply {{imperfections}} (e.g., {{power signal}} ripple, non-zero source impedance) {{may lead to}} noticeable deviations from ideal operational amplifier behavior. For example, operational amplifiers have a specified <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>ratio</b> that indicates how well the output can reject signals that appear on the power supply inputs. Power supply inputs are often noisy in large designs because the power supply is used by nearly every component in the design, and inductance effects prevent current from being instantaneously delivered to every component at once. As a consequence, when a component requires large injections of current (e.g., a digital component that is frequently switching from one state to another), nearby components can experience sagging at their connection to the power supply. This problem can be mitigated with appropriate use of bypass capacitors connected across each power supply pin and ground. When bursts of current are required by a component, the component can bypass the power supply by receiving the current directly from the nearby capacitor (which is then slowly recharged by the power supply).|$|E

40|$|A 4 -transistor (4 -T) CMOS voltage {{reference}} with two high PSRR output voltages is presented. The output voltages are {{equal to the}} scaled voltage difference of two threshold voltages at absolute zero temperature. The temperature coefficients' (TCs) difference of the two threshold voltages is compensated by another transistor-size-controlled temperature coefficient to achieve zero TC outputs. A CMOS {{voltage reference}} with 0. 5 V- 1. 2 V supply voltage, two output voltages of 182 mV and 85. 5 mV, is implemented with a 0. 13 mu m CMOS process.

50|$|There {{are three}} {{principal}} metrics {{of how well}} a current mirror will perform {{as part of a}} larger circuit. The first measure is the static error, the difference between the input and output currents expressed as a fraction of the input current. Minimizing this difference is critical in such applications of a current mirror as the differential to single-ended output signal conversion in a differential amplifier stage because this difference controls the common mode and <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>ratios.</b> The second measure is the output impedance of the current source or equivalently its inverse, the output conductance. This impedance affects stage gain when a current source is used as an active load and affects common mode gain when the source provides the tail current of a differential pair. The last metric is the pair of minimum voltages from the common terminal, usually a power rail connection, to the input and output terminals that are required for proper operation of the circuit. These voltages affect the headroom to the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> rails that is available for the circuitry in which the current mirror is embedded.|$|R
40|$|This {{tutorial}} examines in {{more detail}} {{some of the issues}} relating to amplifiers for use in precision signal conditioning applications. Although the OP 177 op amp is used as the "gold standard " for precision bipolar amplifiers in these discussions, more recent product introductions such as the rail-to-rail output OP 777, OP 727, and OP 747, along with the OP 1177, OP 2177, and OP 4177 offer nearly as good performance in smaller packages. Precision op amp open-loop gains greater than 1 million are available, along with common-mode and <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>rejection</b> <b>ratios</b> of the same magnitude. Offset voltages of less than 25 µV and offset drift less than 0. 1 µV/°C are available in dual supply op amps such as the OP 177, however, the performance in single-supply precision bipolar op amps may sometimes fall short of this performance. This is the tradeoff that must sometimes be made in low power, low voltage applications. On the other hand, however, modern chopper stabilized (auto-zero) op amps provide offsets and offset voltage drifts which cannot be distinguished from noise, and these devices operate on single supplies and provide rail-to-rail inputs and outputs. They too come with their own set of problems that are discussed later within this section. It is important to understand that dc open-loop gain, offset voltage, <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>rejection</b> (PSR), and common-mode rejection (CMR) alone shouldn't be the only considerations in selecting precision amplifiers. The ac performance of the amplifier is also important, even at "low " frequencies. Open-loop gain, PSR, and CMR all have relatively low corner frequencies, and therefore what may be considered "low " frequency may actually fall above these corner frequencies, increasing errors above the value predicted solely by the dc parameters. For example, an amplifier having a dc open-loop gain of 10 million and a unity-gain crossover frequency of 1 MHz has a corresponding corner frequency of 0. 1 Hz! One must therefore consider the open-loop gain at the actual signal frequency. The relationship between the singlepole unity-gain crossover frequency, fu, the signal frequency, fsig, and the open-loop gain AVOL(fsig) (measured at the signal frequency is given by: A VOL...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Supply {{noise is}} a {{significant}} problem in RF systems where it can mix with RF signals, degrading signal/noise ratios and potentially causing violation of spectral masks. This paper presents {{an analysis of the}} supply rejection properties of RF amplifiers. We extend a conventional Volterra-series formulation to treat multiport systems and use it to describe the mixing products between power supply noise and the RF carrier. It is shown that a multiport Volterra formulation can be used to treat weak nonlinearities in the system and that the nonsymmetric cross terms accurately predict low-order mixing phenomenon. We demonstrate the validity of our hand analysis through the design and fabrication of a power amplifier in 180 -nm CMOS, operating between 900 MHz– 2. 4 GHz with a maximum output power of 15 dBm. Spectral regrowth of singletone and EDGE modulation waveforms is shown to match within 1 - 3 dB across frequency and input signal power.
