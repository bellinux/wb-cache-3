Different products require different compositions and properties in the oil. One {{of the most important}} factors is the liquid’s viscosity at various temperatures. Whether or not a crude oil is suitable to be made into a base oil is determined by the concentration of base oil molecules as well as how easily these can be extracted. [...] Base oil is produced by means of refining crude oil. This means that the crude oil is heated in order that various distillates can be separated from one another. During the heating process, light and heavy hydrocarbons are separated - the light ones can be refined to make petrol and other fuels, while the heavier ones are suitable for bitumen and base oils. There are large numbers of crude oils all around the world that {{are used to}} produce base oils. The most common one is a type of <b>paraffinic</b> <b>crude</b> <b>oil,</b> although there are also naphthenic crude oils that create products with better solubility and very good properties at low temperatures. By using hydrogenation technology, in which sulfur and aromatics are removed using hydrogen under high pressure, you can obtain extremely pure base oils, which are suitable when quality requirements are particularly stringent. Chemical substances - additives - are added to the base oil {{in order to meet the}} quality requirements for the end products in terms of, for example, friction and cleaning properties. Certain types of motor oils contain more than twenty percent additives.|$|E

40|$|The phase {{separation}} of <b>paraffinic</b> solids from <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> constitutes a major operating {{issue for the}} petroleum industry, {{in view of the}} fact that the association of wax crystals into a disordered spanning network can lead to severe flow assurance problems. Although the presence of water in <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> is quite common, its impact on waxy <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> gelation and rheology has not received much more attention in the literature.

The rheological characteristics of <b>crude</b> <b>oils</b> are examined both above and below the gel point and a qualitative interpretation of the structure of waxy <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> gels in the presence of water is proposed.

As shown by Holland (2005), the advantages of using distributed feed over single feed are seen in separations with non-sharp split product specifications, thus making ACDU an ideal candidate for feed distribution. For multicomponent mixtures with more than 3 components, compositional plot visualisation is more difficult, thus most graphical methods fail and as a result a representative three component constant volatility mixture of pentane, heptane and hexane was selected on the assumption that it would fairly mimic the <b>paraffinic</b> synthetic <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> behaviour. After analysis of the three component distributed feed schemes, the ideas were then extended to a synthetic <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> system in Aspen Plus.

30|$|Experimental runs were {{conducted}} in a down flow and riser-type pilot plants and a demonstration plant using various catalysts, additives and feedstocks. The results demonstrated {{the advantage of the}} down flow technology to suppress back-mixing and reduce thermal cracking reactions, thereby increasing the yield of light olefins (ethylene, propylene and butylenes) while minimizing dry gas and coke yields despite the high operating temperatures [3]. Using <b>paraffinic</b> <b>crude</b> based vacuum gas <b>oil</b> (VGO) feed and proprietary ultrastable Y-type (USY) FCC catalyst, propylene yield of 25  wt % (feed basis) and gasoline yield of 30  wt % were obtained under HS-FCC reaction conditions [4]. Increasing the yield of the valuable light olefins, especially propylene and butenes, is a profitable opportunity for integrated refineries. As global petrochemical demand for propylene continues to grow, opportunities for improved production routes will emerge. Propylene is used as a feedstock {{for a wide range of}} polymers, product intermediates, chemicals and derivatives.

For a given level of <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> supply, the value of petroleum lies in the value of refined products produced from it. ^ An econometric-linear programming model was developed to capture the linkages between the markets for <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> and refined products. In the LP refiners maximize profits given <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> supplies, refining capacities, and prices of refined products. The objective function is profit maximization net of <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> prices. The shadow price on <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> gives the netback price. Refined product prices are obtained from the econometric models. ^ The model covers the free world divided in five regions. The model is used to analyze the impacts on the markets of policies that affect <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> supplies, the demands for refined products, and the refining industry. For each scenario analyzed the demand for <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> is derived from the equilibrium conditions in the markets for products.

Changes in the demands for products have a larger impact on the markets than changes in the refining industry. Since the markets for refined products and <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> are interrelated they can 2 ̆ 7 t be analyzed individually if an accurate and complete assessment of a policy is to be made.
