30|$|It is {{well known}} that a memoryless vector {{quantizer}} (VQ) can achieve performance arbitrarily close to the rate-distortion (R/D) function of the source, if the codevector dimension is large enough [1]. However, with the increase of the codevector dimension, the memory requirements and the computational complexity of the VQ will also increase exponentially. Furthermore, {{it will be difficult to}} design a practical VQ with high performance in a high-dimensional space. Consequently, various product codevector quantization methods [2 – 5] have been proposed as alternative solutions. These methods cut down the memory requirements and reduce the computational complexity with a moderate loss of quantization performance. Among the widely <b>reported</b> <b>product</b> <b>code</b> techniques, split vector quantizer (SVQ), which was first proposed by Paliwal and Atal [6] for linear predictive coding (LPC) parameters quantization, receives extensive attention. In a SVQ, the input vector is first split into multiple subvectors [7], and then the resulting subvectors are quantized independently [8, 9]. Although the SVQ cuts down the memory requirements and reduces the computational complexity of a memoryless VQ, it ignores the correlations between the subvectors and, hence, leads to a coding loss, referred to as ‘split loss’ [10].|$|R

40|$|Background On July 1 st 2013 the Mandatory <b>Reporting</b> <b>Code</b> Act {{came into}} {{force in the}} Netherlands, making it {{compulsory}} for health professionals to adhere to a <b>reporting</b> <b>code</b> when they suspect patients to be {{victims of domestic violence}} (DV) or child abuse (CA). The Royal Dutch Dental Association (KNMT) developed a <b>reporting</b> <b>code</b> for dental professionals (RCD). Moreover, an e-learning module about DV has been developed. A web-survey was conducted to investigate how general dental practitioners (GDPs) deal with the RCD and what their experiences are with (signs of) DV and CA. Methods In April 2014 1038 GDPs were invited by e-mail to participate in a web-survey consisting of 24 items, through the KNMT Data Stations Project. The data was analyzed using SPSS (RELIABILITY, CHISQ and ANOVA). Results Of all GDPs invited to participate 264 (25 %) responded. 82 % of these GDPs are aware of their obligation to use the <b>reporting</b> <b>code.</b> 54 % of the GDPs are in favor of this obligation. 76 % of the GDPs have taken notice of the KNMT’s RCD and 51 % of the GDPs have implemented the <b>reporting</b> <b>code</b> {{in one form or another}} in their practice. 24 % of the GDPs stated having suspected DV during the last twelve months in the case of 2. 4 patients on average. 81 % took note of this in the patient’s record and 58 % also took action in different ways. 54 % wants to complete the e-learning module. Conclusions Most GDPs are aware of the new legislation and have taken cognizance of the RCD. Even though the majority of GDPs are not opposed to using a <b>reporting</b> <b>code,</b> over half of them have not yet implemented the code in practice. An important factor in this regard seems to be that a substantial minority of the GDPs says they are not sufficiently informed about aspects of reporting a case and about the steps they have to take...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Child {{abuse is}} often unrecognized at out-of-hours primary care (OOH-PC) services. The aim {{of our study}} was to {{evaluate}} the clinical outcome of the screening instrument SPUTOVAMO-R 2 for child abuse (checklist), followed by a structured approach (<b>reporting</b> <b>code),</b> at OOH-PC services. The <b>reporting</b> <b>code</b> with five steps should ensure consistent action {{in case of a}} suspicion. METHODS: All children attending one of the five participating OOH-PC services in the region of Utrecht, the Netherlands, in a year time, were included. The checklist is an obligatory field in the electronic patient file and was filled in for all children. In case of a positive checklist, the steps in the <b>reporting</b> <b>code</b> were followed. Additionally, the case was evaluated in a multidisciplinary team to determine the probability of child abuse. RESULTS: The checklist was filled in for 50671 children; 108 (0. 2  %) were positive. The multidisciplinary team diagnosed child abuse in 24 (22  %) of the 108 positive checklists, and no child abuse in 36 (33  %). Emotional neglect was the most frequent type of abuse diagnosed. For all abused children, care was implemented according to the protocol. The most frequent care given was a referral to the hospital (N[*]=[*] 7) or contact with child's own general practitioner (N[*]=[*] 6). CONCLUSION: A checklist followed by a <b>reporting</b> <b>code</b> guarantees consistent actions and care for children with a suspicion of child abuse. The percentage of positive checklists is lower than expected. Validity of the checklist should be assessed in a diagnostic study...|$|R
