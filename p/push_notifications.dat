RedPhone {{integrated with the}} system dialer to make calls, but used ZRTP {{to set up an}} end-to-end encrypted VoIP channel for the actual call. RedPhone was designed specifically for mobile devices, using audio codecs and buffer algorithms tuned to the characteristics of mobile networks, and used <b>push</b> <b>notifications</b> to preserve the user's device's battery life while still remaining responsive. RedPhone was merged into TextSecure on November 2, 2015. TextSecure was then renamed as Signal for Android. RedPhone's source code was available under the GPLv3 license.|$|E

40|$|Along {{with the}} {{increasing}} in demand of mobile computing, <b>Push</b> <b>Notification</b> (PN) is widely used in mobile phones and other devices. PN allows the developer to send messages to the end users even when the client application is not running at the moment. This solves the problem produced by non-supported multi-tasking feature as well as saving battery life. Microsoft <b>Push</b> <b>Notification</b> Service (MPNS) is one solution to use PNs in Windows Phones.

With similar dimensions to the UP, UP24 features {{the ability to}} sync wirelessly via Bluetooth to the updated app. UP24 has as a 7-day battery life (depending on use) and the previous 3.5mm connector {{was replaced by a}} 2.5mm connector. The software provided more real-time information to help motivate users. The app also suggests goals based on user's habits. Live notifications are provided on the UP24 so users will get <b>push</b> <b>notifications</b> when they get close to their goals. A new activity log gives a snapshot of a user's day and when the UP24 last synced. The 3.0 app also will automatically analyze sleep data from the previous night if users forget to press the button for sleep mode, and lets users edit sleep/wake times.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>push</b> <b>notification</b> is {{a message}} that is [...] "pushed" [...] from backend server or {{application}} to user interface, e.g. (But not limited to) mobile applications and desktop applications. It is more user experience specific which is different from Push technology, which pushes the requests between components such as server to server communication. A common scenario of <b>push</b> <b>notification</b> is the client application pops up a message in front of application's user information, along with the alert sounds. The notification could also be coupled with images and hypertext link in some cases. Via interacting with the <b>push</b> <b>notification</b> it usually brings up the client applications to the front.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The Emerald Ash Borer (EAB) {{has killed}} or infested {{millions}} of ash {{trees in the}} United States. It {{has the potential to}} decimate Ash as a component of North American forests, which will have dramatic ecological and economic effects. Government agencies have joined forces to implement a long-term program to contain and eventually eradicate EAB from North America. One key requirement for the success of this program is the underlying information sharing infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called Sentinel, to automate the dissemination of EAB-related information among EAB partners. We propose an ontology-based service-oriented dissemination model. We introduce three (3) topic-based <b>notification</b> protocols: naïve <b>push</b> <b>notification</b> (NPN), centralized <b>push</b> <b>notification</b> (CPN), and distributed <b>push</b> <b>notification</b> (DPN). Finally, we present experiment results to compare the proposed protocols...|$|R

40|$|<b>Push</b> <b>notification</b> {{is a key}} {{component}} for E-commerce mobile applications, which has been extensively used for user growth and engagement. The effectiveness of the <b>push</b> <b>notification</b> is generally measured by message open rate. A push message can contain a recommended product, a shopping news and etc., but often {{only one or two}} items can be shown in the push message due to the limit of display space. This paper proposes a mixture model approach for predicting push message open rate for a post-purchase complementary product recommendation task. The mixture model is trained to learn latent prediction contexts, which are determined by user and item profiles, and then make open rate predictions accordingly. The item with the highest predicted open rate is then chosen {{to be included in the}} <b>push</b> <b>notification</b> message for each user. The parameters of the mixture model are optimized using an EM algorithm. A set of experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method live with a popular E-Commerce mobile app. The results show that the proposed method is superior than several existing solutions by a significant margin...|$|R
