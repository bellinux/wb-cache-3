5|$|Clarinets {{have the}} largest <b>pitch</b> <b>range</b> of common woodwinds. The {{intricate}} key organization that makes this possible can make the playability of some passages awkward. The bottom of the clarinet's written range {{is defined by the}} keywork on each instrument, standard keywork schemes allowing a low E on the common B clarinet. The lowest concert pitch depends on the transposition of the instrument in question. The nominal highest note of the B clarinet is a semitone higher than the highest note of the oboe. Since the clarinet has a wider range of notes, the lowest note of the B clarinet is significantly deeper (a minor or major sixth) than the lowest note of the oboe.|$|E

25|$|In {{traditional}} Western notation, {{the scale}} {{used for a}} composition is usually indicated by a key signature at the beginning to designate the pitches that make up that scale. As the music progresses, the pitches used may change and introduce a different scale. Music can be transposed from one scale to another for various purposes, often to accommodate the range of a vocalist. Such transposition raises or lowers the overall <b>pitch</b> <b>range,</b> but preserves the intervallic relationships of the original scale. For example, transposition from the key of C major to D major raises all pitches of the scale of C major equally by a whole tone. Since the interval relationships remain unchanged, transposition may be unnoticed by a listener, however other qualities may change noticeably because transposition changes {{the relationship of the}} overall <b>pitch</b> <b>range</b> compared to the range of the instruments or voices that perform the music. This often affects the music's overall sound, as well as having technical implications for the performers.|$|E
25|$|Kurdish music, {{similar to}} other Eastern music, is {{monophonic}} and modal (more specifically, based on the maqam system, which is loosely translated as modal). However, because multiple instruments with varying <b>pitch</b> <b>range,</b> color, and ornamentation capabilities are used to play the same melody, it is also heterophonic. In addition to` specifically Kurdish modes (maqams), Kurdish music also utilizes all the modes and dastgahs found in the traditional music of Iran.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{standard}} <b>pitch</b> <b>range</b> for the carillon. In general, {{a concert}} carillon {{will have a}} minimum of 48 bells. The range of any given instrument usually depends on funds available for the fabrication and installation of the instrument: more money allows more bells to be cast, especially the larger, more costly ones. Older carillons can be transposing instruments, generally transposing upward. Most modern instruments sound at concert pitch. A carillon clavier has both a manual and a pedal keyboard.|$|E

25|$|Listeners' {{ratings in}} Barron-Lutzross's {{experiment}} of {{likelihood that a}} speaker is a lesbian correlated with several different phonological variables. Lower median pitch, a wider <b>pitch</b> <b>range,</b> a lower second formant, and more use of creaky voice correlated positively with listeners perceiving a voice as lesbian-sounding. Despite this, Barron-Lutzross {{did not find any}} direct correlations between these phonetic variables and sexual orientation. She stated that this could mean that listeners were using additional features which were not tested for to make judgments about the speakers' sexuality.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, Cage {{completed}} a piece called Two, for flute and piano, dedicated to performers Roberto Fabbriciani and Carlo Neri. The title {{referred to the}} number of performers needed; the music consisted of short notated fragments to be played at any tempo within the indicated time constraints. Cage went on to write some forty such pieces, one of the last being Eighty (1992, premiered in Munich on 28 October 2011), usually employing a variant of the same technique; together, these works are known as Number Pieces. The process of composition, in many of the later Number Pieces, was simple selection of <b>pitch</b> <b>range</b> and pitches from that range, using chance procedures; the music has been linked to Cage's anarchic leanings. One11 (i.e. the eleventh piece for a single performer), completed in early 1992, was Cage's first and only foray into film.|$|E
25|$|The luthiers {{also worked}} {{with the idea of}} modifying the {{mandolin}} to meet local musical styles, making experimental changes to the necks of violins, guitars and mandolins to suit them to Cai luong opera music. In the mid-1930s, they made concave frets, scooping out extra wood between the frets, making the space between them deep and to allow the musicians to bend the notes, and stringing them with four single strings. Musicians Hai Nén and Hai Nhành were associated with the instruments, possibly being the first to use them. The sunken-fret mandolin (mandolin phím lõm) did not meet the musical needs as well as the sunken-fret guitar, because the mandolin's rigidity made it painful to get the same effects from the strings. Also the mandolin's narrow fretboard made it difficult to hit the notes. Another reason to move to a bigger instrument was the <b>pitch</b> <b>range</b> of the mandolin, high pitched and not as useful to accompany singing as the instruments that replaced it in the opera.|$|E

500|$|Songs in Peking opera are proscribed {{by a set}} {{of common}} {{aesthetic}} values. A majority of songs are within a <b>pitch</b> <b>range</b> of an octave and a fifth. High pitch is a positive aesthetic value, so a performer will pitch songs {{at the very top of}} his or her vocal range. [...] For this reason, the idea of a song's key has value in Peking opera only as a technical tool for the performer. Different performers in the same performance may sing in different keys, requiring the accompanying musicians to constantly retune their instruments or switch out with other players. Elizabeth Wichmann describes the ideal basic timbre for Peking opera songs as a [...] "controlled nasal tone". Performers make extensive use of vocal vibrato during songs, in a way that is [...] "slower" [...] and [...] "wider" [...] than vibrato used in Western performances. The Peking opera aesthetic for songs is summed up by the expression zi zheng qiang yuan, meaning that the written characters should be delivered accurately and precisely, and the melodic passages should be weaving, or [...] "round".|$|E

[...] These allowed the S-67 to achieve and maintain high cruise speeds. To reduce drag at high speed, the mainwheels retracted fully into the stub wing sponsons. It had speed brakes on the wing trailing edges {{that could be used to}} decrease speed or increase maneuverability.|$|E
