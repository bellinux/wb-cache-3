50|$|The {{unanimous}} {{judgment of}} the Supreme Court was delivered by Justice Gonthier. The Court allowed the appeal and held that a plaintiff in an action for the alleged <b>passing-off</b> of a prescription drug must establish that the conduct complained of is {{likely to result in}} the confusion of physicians, pharmacists or patients/customers in choosing whether to prescribe, dispense or request either the plaintiff's or the defendant's product. Therefore, patients are considered {{to be part of the}} relevant public in a <b>passing-off</b> action as they are the ultimate consumes of the drugs.|$|E
5000|$|The role of <b>passing-off</b> is {{therefore}} {{to rectify the}} likely harms one trader suffers from the acts of another that mistakenly deflect consumers from dealing with the former or his products or services. Although the tort grew up to protect the interests of traders rather than consumers, the less it works to prevent consumer confusion, the more it becomes merely a law protecting traders from unfair competition. That goal may be what other torts, such as conspiracy or unlawful interference with economic relations, and Competition Act provisions regulating false and misleading advertising practices aim at. <b>Passing-off</b> need not replicate their aspirations.|$|E

50|$|The {{purpose of}} the <b>passing‑off</b> action is thus also to prevent unfair competition. One {{does not have to}} be a fanatical moralist to {{understand}} how appropriating another person's work, as that is certainly what is involved, is a breach of good faith.|$|E
5000|$|Misrepresentation is {{required}} in <b>passing-off,</b> which doesn’t protect loss of control for instance, while mere depreciation of goodwill could suffice in registration. However, this distinction is more limited nowadays, since passing off gives protection against loss of control as long as misrepresentation is proved.|$|E
50|$|Registration is costly; however, {{once the}} trade-mark is registered, proving an {{infringement}} is easier and therefore possibly {{less expensive than}} a common law <b>passing-off</b> action. The rationales behind the two notions also differ: passing off merely protects the disruption of economic relations by misrepresentation, while registration actually sees marks as commodities.|$|E
5000|$|Registration doesn’t require {{proof of}} damage. It can also allow a {{claimant}} {{to stop the}} use of similar marks, despite the defendant’s disavowal.

5000|$|In {{determining}} {{the purpose of}} a passing off action, the Court cited Consumers Distributing Co. v. Seiko Time Canada Ltd.:“The courts have wavered between two conceptions of a <b>passing-off</b> action -- as a remedy for the invasion of a quasi-proprietary right in a trade name or trade mark, and as a remedy, analogous to the action on the case for deceit, for invasion of the personal right not to be injured by fraudulent competition.” ...|$|E
50|$|The Court {{concluded}} three necessary {{components of}} a <b>passing-off</b> action from previous case law: the existence of goodwill, deception of the public due to a misrepresentation and actual or potential damage to the plaintiff. In order for a manufacturer to succeed in a passing off action, {{he or she had}} to show that its product had acquired a secondary meaning with its customers and that the competing product was likely to create a risk of confusion in the public mind. The confusion can arise from both wilful as well as negligent or careless misrepresentation by the manufacturer.|$|E
50|$|Other {{functions}} rely not on {{recognition of}} some token or weight of metal in a marketplace, where time to detect any counterfeit is limited and benefits for successful <b>passing-off</b> are high, but on more stable long term social contracts: one cannot easily force a whole society {{to accept a}} different standard of deferred payment, require even small groups of people to uphold a floor price for a store of value, still less to re-price everything and rewrite all accounts to a unit of account (the most stable function). Thus {{it tends to be}} the medium of exchange function that constrains what {{can be used as a}} form of financial capital.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} precedent {{considered in}} this appeal {{is the case}} of Ayerst, McKenna & Harrison, Inc. v. Apotex Inc.(1983), which addressed similar issues associated with drugs with similar appearance. In the Court of Appeal decision, Cory J.A. commented that for the purposes of a <b>passing-off</b> action the customers of pharmaceutical laboratories consist exclusively of health care professionals and not the patients who use the product. This decision was subsequently followed by a number of cases.The Court declined to follow the opinion in Ayerst, McKenna & Harrison. One of the reasons is that the field of prescription drugs is just like any other market, where the ultimate consumer should be taken into account in a tort of passing off, {{and there is no reason}} for the Court to adopt a different rule when the manufacturer is a pharmaceutical laboratory.In addressing Ciba-Geigy’s argument, the Court also observed that despite the regulatory restriction on public advertising of prescription drugs, patients can still gain knowledge about the products through pharmaceutical advertising directed at health care professionals, and therefore risk being affected by confusion.Another important consideration by the Court is that the Prescription Drug Cost Regulation Act which later came into force gave patients increased control over the brand of drug he or she wishes to obtain where the product is interchangeable. The Court found that patients do have the opportunity to exercise their choice over the product brand in the prescription process, therefore patients should be included in the customers covered by the <b>passing-off</b> action as they are also exposed to the risk of confusion.|$|E
5000|$|Ciba-Geigy is a {{pharmaceutical}} laboratory which has manufactured and sold metoprolol tablets in Canada under the trade name “Lopresor” since 1977.

Novopharm, another respondent joined in the action also manufactured tablets with the same get-up. The three drugs have been designated interchangeable pharmaceutical products by Ontario law, which means that a pharmacist may give a patient any one of them as long as the prescription does not specify no substitution.In June 1986 the Ciba-Geigy brought <b>passing-off</b> actions against Apotex and Novopharm, alleging that its metoprolol tablets have a unique get-up by reason of their size, shape and colour and that this get-up has become associated with its product. In order to establish that Apotex and Novopharm were engaged in passing off by confusing the public with their products, Ciba-Geigy needed to prove that the customers of these drugs were likely to be misled by the similarity of the products. [...] At the trial level, Ciba-Geigy failed to establish that the customers, namely physicians and pharmacists that prescribe or dispense metoprolol, were confused in choosing the brand of metoprolol to give to patients due to the similar appearance of the tablets. For this reason, the Supreme Court of Ontario refused to issue an interlocutory injunction because Ciba-Geigy failed to show that there was a [...] "serious issue" [...] to be tried.At the Court of Appeal, Ciba-Geigy argued that the customers affected by the <b>passing-off</b> should include ultimate consumer of the prescribed drug as {{they are likely to be}} confused by the similar appearance of the products in question.

40|$|Interest in the {{supposed}} defence of honest use of one’s own name in <b>passing-off</b> has revived {{in the past}} decade, although the search for an unequivocal example of the defence continues to be unproductive. This article concentrates {{on the case of}} Newman v Adlem and the very different attitudes to the defence exhibited by Jacob LJ and Arden LJ in their respective judgments. It is suggested that Jacob LJ is probably correct in asserting that the defence does not really exist, but that in reaching this conclusion he appears to have misinterpreted the classic judgment of Romer J in Rodgers v Rodgers. In particular, it is argued that Jacob LJ has imposed on Romer J a supposed distinction between “confusion” and “deception” which was entirely alien to the latter’s way of thinking, while overlooking the distinction which Romer J really had in mind, which was between the inherent consequences arising from the use of the name per se, and those arising from all the other factors {{under the control of the}} defendant.

40|$|Cambridge University Press 2008 and Cambridge University Press, 2009. Introduction: The law {{of trade}} marks has evolved, in {{different}} jurisdictions, by addressing two interconnected sets of questions. The first set consists of {{questions regarding the}} degree of protection against confusion and deception that should be offered to consumers and traders, over and above traditional <b>passing-off</b> arrangements, in cases where names are used as trade badges or signatures of commercial personae. The second set, less prominent in the literature, are more abstract questions about how names and descriptions achieve their functions of denoting and referring to things in the world. Current legal argument is concerned to find a satisfactory route through these two, intertwined sets of difficulties. This chapter argues that the question voiced in no-nonsense Victorian fashion in my title (which, as Lionel Bently shows elsewhere in this volume, encapsulates a developing nineteenth-century concern with precisely {{what it is about}} a sign that allows it to function as a trade mark) resists a definitive answer as much now as during the Victorian period, and continues to have legal significance. Understandably in legal studies the main emphasis in relation to these two questions falls on how signs function as badges of origin in changing markets, rather than how signs function in principle. In this chapter, in a way that I intend to be complementary, I consider questions about trade mark signification from a broadly linguistic rather than legal perspective.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the topic of}} goodwill {{and the possibility of}} achieving a synthesis between its legal and accounting concepts. The genesis for this topic was the assertion by the High Court in FCT v. Murry that the legal and accounting concepts of goodwill were different to the extent that a synthesis between the concepts could not be achieved. The approach taken involves an examination of the evolution, nature and treatment of goodwill in both the legal and accounting contexts. The major focus is on the legal concept, but significant attention is also given to the accounting concept to enable an examination of the possibility of a synthesis between the two. Thus chapters 2 - 12 deal largely with the legal concept of goodwill and chapters 13 - 14 deal with the accounting concept. Chapter 15 contains the final analysis and conclusions. Chapter 1 introduces the topic and addresses a range of definitions of goodwill, both legal and accounting definitions. Chapter 2 examines the evolution of goodwill as a commercial legal concept dating back to early references in the sixteenth century. Chapter 3 carries on the examination of the legal concept {{from the point of view}} of it major elements and sources. Chapter 4 deals with important issues which go to the heart of our understanding of legal goodwill. The essential issues concern the concept of goodwill as one whole item of property, inseparably attached to a business but separate from its sources. Chapters 5 - 12 examine the concept in a range of specific legal contexts in order to determine what they add to our understanding and also to determine how the essential nature of legal goodwill holds up in these various contexts. Chapter 5 deals with goodwill in the context of partnerships. Much of the case law involving goodwill in this context arose in the nineteenth century in relation to the termination of partnerships. Chapter 6 examines goodwill in relation to restrictive covenants designed to protect the goodwill of a business. The history of the law of restrictive covenants can be traced back to the fifteenth century, where an incipient notion of goodwill may be seen to be emerging. Chapter 7 examines goodwill in the context of stamp duties, a tax with a long pedigree stretching back to the late seventeenth century. Chapter 8 examines the authorities concerning the nature and treatment of goodwill in the contexts of licensing, leasing and franchising. In chapter 9 the legal concept of goodwill is examined in the broad-ranging context of the tort of <b>passing-off.</b> Goodwill plays a central part in the modern tort as the element of business to be protected from damage by the act of <b>passing-off.</b> As discussed in chapter 10, the field of compensation law presents certain treatments of goodwill which strictly run counter to its legal nature, particularly in respect of counting goodwill as part of land in calculating an amount of compensation. However, as explained in this chapter, this is no more than a deeming device for the specific purposes of calculating compensation and thus should not be taken to deviate from the normal concept of goodwill. Chapter 11 deals with goodwill in a number of tax contexts not covered elsewhere in this paper. The relationship between tax and goodwill has been an uneasy one with a degree of friction between the concept of goodwill and its tax treatment. The last of the chapters focussing on legal goodwill, chapter 12, addresses issues concerning valuation in the legal context. Chapters 13 and 14 deal with the accounting concept of goodwill. Chapter 13 examines the origin and development of goodwill. It plots the evolution of accounting goodwill from its recognizable beginnings in the 1880 s to WWII. Chapter 14 carries on with the examination of accounting goodwill in the modern period, identified as the period after WWII with an emphasis on the time from the early 1980 s. As noted in the conclusion to that chapter, the definition, valuation and treatment of accounting goodwill have changed little in substance from the earlier periods pre-WWII. The conclusion in chapter 15 is that goodwill is essentially the same concept in both law and accounting, but a compound concept comprising different facets which apply in different contexts. Therefore, the need strictly to determine a synthesis is rendered redundant by this concept of goodwill...|$|E
40|$|As {{the demand}} for Continuous Professional Development (CPD) expands {{with the growth of}} 'professional bodies', many Universities and {{learning}} providers are offering a combination of short courses and accredited courses to industry in the form of 'professional and work based learning'. The two concepts are run together as one common theme, such that one could be subsumed within the other, or they are joined in some form of twinning. But should this actually be the case? This paper examines the roots of 'professionalism' from the first offerings of Higher Education in medicine, law and the ministry, through the economic development of the term to include anything that is carried out for monetary reward, the social development of the term to include anything that is not 'amateur', to the ethical foundations of the word stemming from professions being 'trustworthy' and contributing to society. A number of job roles that claim to have 'professional bodies' are case studied to ascertain {{the extent to which they}} meet the criteria of actually being professionals, or whether they are <b>passing-off</b> as professions to enjoy some of the benefits accrued by the term without the detriments of adhering to the criteria, including accountants, lawyers, managers, teachers and social workers. Given the historical development of the 'professions' and the differences between the rhetoric and the reality, the paper goes on to examine what is offered in terms of 'professional learning' and 'work based learning' and offers a model that demonstrates that while the two may not be mutually exclusive, they are by no means all consuming of each other. Drawing on the examples outlined in the first section, distinctions are drawn between professional and work based learning both in theory and practice, and conclusions are drawn as to the trend towards convergence in the reality of provisions at the expense of the divergence in the ideals. This multidisciplinary paper draws on economic theory, sociology, ethics and educational theory to develop a model for the future that ensure that the roots of professional learning are not lost within the wider field of work based learning...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the {{analysis}} and development of rigorous modal expansion techniques for determining the scattering properties of singly-periodic diffraction gratings. Both reflection and transmission gratings are considered, and although emphasis is given to a theoretical study of the formalisms, many numerical results obtained with the latter are also presented. Most of the formalisms pertain to gratings having specific groove geometries and infinitely-conducting surfaces. However, in two cases one or other of these constraints is removed. Several of the established formalisms, based {{on a variety of}} nonmodal techniques, are reviewed, and the essence of their method described. The advantages that modal treatments have over these methods are explained, and previous applications of the former are summarised. Initial theoretical investigations concern the rectangular-groove grating. Intensive studies reveal an alternative approach to the concept of diffraction resonance anomalies. They also provide new insight into the understanding of this grating 1 s overall behaviour, including its blazing and <b>passing-off</b> properties in the first-order Littrow mounting. These ideas are usefully extended throughout the thesis to encompass the behaviour of all gratings. The theoretical treatment for the rectangular-groove grating is adapted to account for the diffraction properties of three unusual profiles which also possess a rectangular geometry. Two of these structures consist of a transmission grating on a reflecting element, and are shown to exhibit a pronounced resonance action. Tuning of the various grating parameters governs the behaviour of the resonances and indicates the potential use of these devices as a type of reflecting Fabry-Perot interferometer. The third structure is a stepped reflection grating which proves capable of accurately mode l 1 i ng the performance of general profile gratings including those with sinusoidal and triangular profi 1 es. Single and bi-modal expansions are shown to provide useful field approximations for not only the conventional rectangular-groove grating, but also for two of the three related structures. These approximations aid in the examination of resonances and other spectral phenomena. Their regions of accuracy and validity are determined. The assumption of perfect conductivity is relaxed in a formalism which is described for dielectric and lossy metallic surfaces. The method is tailored specifically to the rectangular-groove profile {{and is one of the}} few modal expansion techniques appropriate to non-perfectly conducting gratings. The thesis concludes with the presentation of two formalisms which employ an impedance-related condition to completely specify a set of modal functions. The first formalism prescribes a solution for a grating whose grooves are semi-circular in cross-section. Eigenfunctions for a circular waveguide constitute the modal functions. The second formalism accommodates reflection profiles of general groove crosssection, and utilizes a superposition of the rectangular-waveguide eigenfunctions. The first formalism is employed to evaluate in detail the spectral performance of the semi-circular groove grating, while the second is applied, not only to this grating, but also to the triangular and sinusoidal groove gratings...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the development of}} copyright and patent protection in the United States, United Kingdom and Australia and proposes that intellectual property is not the correct mechanism for protecting computer software. Both copyright and patent protection are evaluated {{in relation to their}} application to protecting the various elements of software. The increased desire for patent protection of software in the United States has recently impacted the debate over the correct regime for intellectual property protection. There has also been a corresponding restriction in the application of copyright protection by the courts. Combined with an undercurrent of sui generis software legislation being advocated by academia this has lead to the situation where there is continuing uncertainty over which method of protection should be provided for software. It will be shown that copyright is inadequate for the protection of computer software and that it does not address the correct element requiring protection. Patents, by corollary, provide protection that is excessive. The socio-economic effects of patent protection will be shown to demonstrate {{that it is not a}} worthy successor or adjunct to copyright. While copyright has attempted to protect one aspect (source code) patents have attempted to protect another (functionality). The thesis identifies the fundamental flaws in the protection offered by both regimes and proposes that they are equally unsuitable for the protection of software. Software will be shown to possess a diverse array of elements that are largely indivisible if adequate protection is to be provided. It is proposed that software be considered as a new form of property, referred to as Binary property, which covers informational and information processing entities. Further, the existing common law principles should be applied to the aspects that are at the heart of the intellectual property protection dilemma. In reality the elements requiring protection in software are activities that wrongfully duplicate a work or replicate it to create clones. It will be shown that the common law principles of theft, trespass, breach of contract and <b>passing-off</b> are suitable for protecting developers from these infringements. It will also be contended that any legislative intervention should be limited so that a certain degree of replication is allowable where there is a benefit to society through technological advancement or enhancement through standardisation. As such the application of common law principles are applied in a minimalist legalistic environment. The minimalist approach takes the position that there should be minimal legislative intervention in the computer industry. It proposes that there should be legislative intervention to enable the existing common law to take account of computer technology and provide for its continuing impact on society that will accelerate into the next millennium. It further shows that the continuing development of computer technology will outpace intellectual property necessitating the recognition of computer software as a unique form of new property in existing jurisprudence. The application of existing common law principles of property and the reduction in the monopolistic nature of intellectual property will not only benefit the highly dynamic and creative international computer industry but it will also be in the best interests of the Australian software development industry...|$|E
