The ETS contract with the QCA was terminated in August 2008, with an agreement to pay back £19.5m and cancel invoices worth £4.6m. Subsequently, the contract for National Curriculum assessment marking and processing was again awarded to Edexcel. Like the two prior contracts, the Edexcel contract has encountered significant quality problems and the tests themselves, the focus of longstanding controversy in the English education community and among the public, have been subjected to a massive boycott by schools.|$|E

40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to the {{specific}} for Russian and Ukrainian industries contract for input supply that exhibits great and stable share in production of several homogenous industrial outputs over the last five years. This contract, named <b>processing</b> <b>contract,</b> is analyzed as a way of reallocation of property rights on the assets of refining enterprises in the short-run. Processing can be considered as a tool of vertical integration. It enables a supplier to neutralize “double marginalization ” in vertical chain and therefore increases profitability of business. Although use of processing does not provide “vertical profit ” in the sense of Mathewson and Winter, processing instead of buying an existing enterprise reduces the sunk cost of entry on the market to new firm controlling the supply of input.

40|$|This study {{examines}} coordination issues {{that occur in}} allocating spending between advertising and information technology (IT) in electronic retailing. Electronic retailers {{run the risk of}} overspending on advertising to attract customers but underspending on IT, thus resulting in inadequate processing capacity at the firm’s website. In this paper, we present a centralized, joint marketing-IT model to optimally allocate spending between advertising and IT, and we discuss an uncoordinated case where marketing and IT make suboptimal advertising and capacity decisions. We show how these decisions can be coordinated either by reducing the value of a customer session or by designing an optimal <b>processing</b> <b>contract</b> between marketing and IT. Both the coordination methods can be implemented with only local knowledge of the IT function, yet they generate a solution that almost matches the quality of the centralized solution. We extend our basic model to consider demand uncertainty, lagged advertising effects, and uncertainties in the lead time to acquire IT capacity. With demand uncertainty, electronic retailers should reduce spending on advertising and increase IT capacity if there is potential for a demand upswing and the cost of IT capacity is relatively low. The value of a customer session should be further reduced when uncertainties exist. This is required to share the risk of excess or inadequate IT capacity.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Site-Specific Irrigation Management (SSIM) can {{be defined}} as {{irrigation}} management (depth, timing) based on crop need to defined sub-areas of a field referred to as management zones. Implementation of SSIM will require additional irrigation system hardware, labor, and information on soil and/or plant water status in each management zone. Costs associated with these additional requirements will need to be offset by increased receipts from improved crop yield and quality in order for the technology to be adopted by producers. The potential for SSIM to increase crop yield, quality, and economic return has not been evaluated in field studies. Crops such as potatoes, for which yield and quality are highly sensitive to soil water availability, are most likely to show an economic benefit from site-specific irrigation management. A two-year field study was conducted to evaluate the potential for SSIM to increase yield and quality of potatoes relative to Conventional Uniform Irrigation Management (CUIM). Near real-time soil water content was used to schedule irrigations under both irrigation management treatments. Field average water application was nearly the same for the irrigation management treatments, 503 mm (19. 8 in.) in 2001 and 445 mm (17. 5 in.) in 2002. In both study years, tuber yield distributions trended 4 % greater under site-specific irrigation management but were not significantly different (p < 0. 05). Total tuber yield per unit of water applied from irrigation and precipitation was 4 % greater in 2001 and 6 % greater in 2002 under SSIM. Based on a local tuber quality adjusted potato <b>processing</b> <b>contract</b> price structure, the trend in gross income averaged across the field site was $ 159 /ha ($ 65 /acre) greater with SSIM. This increase in gross income is likely about half the actual cost o...|$|E

Department of Energy (DOE) is {{currently}} planning to retrieve, pretreat, immobilize and safely dispose of 53 {{million gallons of}} highly radioactive waste currently stored in underground tanks at Hanford Site. The DOE plan is a two-phased approach to privatizing the processing of hazardous and radioactive waste. Phase 1 is a proof-of-concept/commercial demonstration-scale effort whose objectives are to: demonstrate, the technical and business viability of using privatized facilities to treat Hanford tank waste; define and maintain required levels of radiological, nuclear, process and occupational safety; maintain environmental protection and compliance; and substantially reduce life-cycle costs and time required to treat Hanford tank waste. The Phase 1 effort consists of Part A and Part B. On September 25, 1996 (Reference 1), DOE {{signed a contract with}} BNFL, Inc. (BNFL) to commence with Phase 1, Part A. In August 1998, BNFL was authorized to proceed with Phase I, Part 6 - 1, a 24 -month design phase that will-provide sufficient engineering and financial maturity to establish fixed-unit prices and financing terms for tank waste processing services in privately-owned and -operated facilities.

40|$|Temporary work is an {{employment}} situation useful and suitable in all occasions in which business needs to adjust more easily and quickly to workload fluctuations or maintain staffing flexibility. Temporary workers play therefore {{an important role}} in many companies, but this kind of activity is subject to a special form of legal protections and many aspects and risks {{must be taken into account}} both employers and employees. In this work we propose a blockchain-based system that aims to ensure respect for the rights for all actors involved in a temporary employment, in order to provide employees with the fair and legal remuneration (including taxes) of work performances and a protection in the case employer becomes insolvent. At the same time, our system wants to assist the employer in <b>processing</b> <b>contracts</b> with a fully automated and fast procedure. To resolve these problems we propose the D-ES (Decentralized Employment System). We first model the employment relationship as a state system.

40|$|The {{increasing}} use of automation in libraries {{has made}} many librarians painfully aware {{of the difficulty of}} negotiating for computer products and services. This is true {{for a wide range of}} situations, such as acquiring a turnkey system, joining a network, subscribing to an information retrieval service and many others. While negotiation should be a give-and-take process between parties on an equal footing, librarians often see themselves as being at a disadvantage. The product or service is technically complex, the legal instruments are mysterious, and the other party has greater experience with the technology, the law and the art of negotiating. The purpose of the 1977 clinic was to enable librarians to be stronger, more knowledgeable negotiators. Some of the papers printed here present negotiation from the librarian's viewpoint; other papers deal with the special needs and concerns of the vendor. In every case, the intent is to make negotiation a rational and orderly process. In their complementary papers, Boss and Gurr show that differing interests need not result in an adversary relationship between vendor and librarian. In his paper, Corey examines in some detail the special problems of negotiating when legally enforceable contracts are not possible.
