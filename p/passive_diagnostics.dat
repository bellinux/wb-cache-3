40|$|A closed 13. 6 MHz inductively coupled argon plasma with {{a volume}} of 2 cm 3 is {{investigated}} by active and <b>passive</b> <b>diagnostics.</b> The study considers the influence of varying argon filling pressures in the range 10 - 100 mbar and different input powers in the range 50 - 125 W. The combination of the applied techniques of absolute line emission intensities, Thomson scattering and diode laser absorption measurements reveals the typical behaviour of temperature and electron density of the plasma. One of the observed characteristics is that, upon increasing the filling pressure, the ring-shaped radial distribution of the electron density becomes more pronounced, while the electron temperature decreases over the whole radial profile. Furthermore, the influence of input power on the electron temperature and density depends strongly on the filling pressure.

A complete set of faults for these components was compiled and a fault mode analysis performed to understand the detectable symptoms of the faults and the chain of causation. A set of 26 algorithms was developed to facilitate the automatic correction of these faults in typical commercial VAV systems.

Nevertheless, the interpretation of the spectra of OES is not straight-forward. The delicacy lies in the complex nature of the plasma and subsequently the manifold atomic processes.

TS is an active diagnostic method and the experimental results {{are directly related to}} important plasma properties such as the electron density, ne, and the electron temperature, Te. Therefore, the TS results for ne and Te can be used to calibrate <b>passive</b> <b>diagnostic</b> methods which are often based on plasma models. However, to apply TS on a surfatron induced plasma inside a quartz tube is experimentally demanding because of the large amount of stray light and a low intensity of the TS signal.

For a typical plasma condition with an argon pressure of 10 mbar and an absorbed power of 50 W, the measured electron density was found to be equal to ne 4 × 1019 m- 3 and the electron temperature Te 1. 2 eV. In addition, frame-averaged results for 6, 10, 15 and 20 mbar argon plasmas for absorbed microwave powers in between 25 = Pab = 60 W are presented.

40|$|The {{conventional}} colonoscopy is {{a common}} procedure used to access the colon. Despite it being considered the Gold Standard procedure for colorectal cancer diagnosis and treatment, it {{has a number of}} major drawbacks, including high patient discomfort, infrequent but serious complications and high skill required to perform the procedure. There are a number of potential alternatives to the conventional colonoscopy, from augmenting the colonoscope to using Computed Tomography Colonography (CTC) - a completely non-invasive method. However, a truly effective, all-round alternative has yet to be found. This thesis explores the design and development of a novel solution: a fully mobile colonoscopy robot called “RollerBall”. Unlike current <b>passive</b> <b>diagnostic</b> capsules, such as PillCam, this device uses wheels at the end of adjustable arms to provide locomotion through the colon, while providing a stable platform for the use of diagnostic and therapeutic tools. The work begins by reviewing relevant literature to better understand the problem and potential solutions. RollerBall is then introduced and its design described in detail. A robust prototype was then successfully fabricated using a 3 D printing technique and its performance assessed in a series of benchtop experiments. These showed that the mechanisms functioned as intended and encouraged the further development of the concept. Next, the fundamental requirement of gaining traction on the colon was shown to be possible using hexagonal shaped, macro-scale tread patterns. A friction coefficient ranging between 0. 29 and 0. 55 was achieved with little trauma to the tissue substrate. The electronics hardware and control were then developed and evaluated in a series of tests in silicone tubes. An open-loop strategy was first used to establish the control algorithm to map the user inputs to motor outputs (wheel speeds). These tests showed the efficacy of the locomotion technique and the control algorithm used, but they highlighted the need for autonomy. To address this, feedback was included to automate the adjusting of the arm angle and amount of force applied by the device; a forward facing camera was also used to automate the orientation control by tracking a user-defined target. Force and orientation control were then combined to show that semi-autonomous control was possible and as a result, it was concluded that clinical use may be feasible in future developments...|$|R

In TFTR, ICE was observed from super-Alfvénic α-particles in the plasma edge. The intensity of beam-driven ICE in DIII-D is more strongly correlated with drops in neutron rate during fishbone excitation than signals from more direct beam ion loss diagnostics.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{several experiments}} {{performed at the}} LLNL Site 300 firing range and on the LLNL 1 / 3 scale gun to investigate the deceleration of small projectiles (l {approx} 3 - 5 [mm]) in low-density foam ({rho} {approx} 0. 08 - 0. 32 [g/cm{sup 3 }]). The experiments at the firing range researched a <b>passive</b> velocity <b>diagnostic</b> based on Faraday's law of induction, while experiments on the 1 / 3 scale gun investigated the effects of varying projectile surface area, projectile shape, and foam density on the drag coefficient c{sub d}. Analysis shows that the velocity diagnostic has an uncertainty {{on the order of}} 1 percent for projectiles with velocity v {approx} 0. 8 - 1. 2 [km/s]. The 1 / 3 scale gun experiments, dubbed the Krispy Kreme series, included nine shots considering the combinations of 3 projectile surface areas with 3 target densities. The experiments used Tantalum square surface area block projectiles (with an initial velocity v{sub 0 } {approx} 1. 2 [km/s], a common thickness T = 2. 67 [mm], and square side lengths of 3, 4, and 5 [mm]) decelerating in polyurethane foams (with densities {rho}{sub f} of 0. 08, 0. 16 and 0. 32 [g/cm{sup 3 }]). Standard fluid models of the Krispy Kreme experiments predict Reynolds numbers Re {approx} 10 {sup 5 } - 10 {sup 6 }, Mach numbers Ma {approx} 0. 5 - 2. 0, and drag coefficients c{sub d} {approx} 2 - 3. However, the data indicate that c{sub d} = 1. 1 - 1. 2 (c{sub d} = 1. 7) for all three block projectiles in the 0. 08 and 0. 16 [g/cm{sup 3 }] targets (0. 32 [g/cm{sup 3 }] target). First, we conclude that the drag force on projectiles in solid polyurethane foam is less than in fluids with equivalent dimensionless parameters. This result is also supported by an additional Krispy Kreme experiment that used a disk projectile (with diameter d = 4. 51 [mm] and thickness T = 2. 67 [mm]) penetrating a target with density {rho} = 0. 16 [g/cm{sup 3 }], i. e., the fluid-like c{sub d} = 1. 15 while the measured c{sub d} = 0. 63. Second, we conclude that the measured drag coefficient in the lower density foam targets is less than in the larger density foam target. This result is corroborated by firing range experiments with M 855 NATO bullets (with diameter 5. 56 [mm], mass 4. 1 [g], and initial velocity {nu}{sub 0 } {approx} 800 [m/s]) fired from an M 16 rifle, i. e., c{sub d} = 0. 3 (c{sub d} = 0. 6) in the 0. 16 [g/cm{sup 3 }] (0. 32 [g/cm{sup 3 }]) target.

Recent experimental results from ASDEX Upgrade and DIII-D demonstrate the efficacy of ICE as a diagnostic of different fast ion species and of fast ion losses, while recent particle-in-cell (PIC) and hybrid simulations provide a more exact comparison with measured ICE spectra and open the prospect of exploiting ICE more fully as a fast ion diagnostic in future experiments. In particular the PIC/hybrid approach should soon {{make it possible to}} simulate the nonlinear physics of ICE in full toroidal geometry. Emission has been observed previously at a wide range of poloidal angles, so there is flexibility in the location of ICE detectors. Such a detector could be implemented in ITER by installing a small toroidally orientated loop near the plasma edge or by adding a detection capability to the ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) antennae. In the latter case, the antenna could be used simultaneously to heat the plasma and detect ICE, provided that frequencies close to those of the ICRH source are strongly attenuated in the detection system using a suitable filter.

As a unique approach, we have tested a RF cavity filled with a high pressure hydrogen gas with a 400 MeV proton beam in an external magnetic field (B = 3 T). Quantitative information {{about the number of}} protons passing through this cavity is an essential requirement of the beam test. The MTA is a flammable gas (hydrogen) hazard zone. Due to safety reasons, no active (energized) beam diagnostic instrument can be used.

40|$|<b>Passive</b> {{spectroscopy}} <b>diagnostics</b> play a {{key role}} in advancing the physics of plasma exhaust in the edge and divertor regions of tokamaks. Information obtained from spectral line intensities and profile shapes is crucial for estimating plasma parameters, particularly for studies of cold and dense detached plasmas. This work aims to characterise the visible and near-infrared spectral regions with emphasis on the Balmer and Paschen hydrogen series lines, their diagnostic applications and interpretation techniques. Whereas the Balmer series lines are measured routinely, few observations of the Paschen series lines have been carried out in the fusion plasma context. Extending observations to the near-infrared region for more detailed studies of the Paschen series is addressed through diagnostic development with the aim of providing coverage of the visible to near-infrared spectral range (350 - 1900 nm) along the same optical line-of-sight. An initial spectral survey on MAST using a purpose built diagnostic provides new insight into the spectral features in the near-infrared and confirms the viability of Paschen line observations. Following the proof of concept measurements on MAST, diagnostic development on the JET ITER-like wall mirror-linked divertor spectroscopy system facilitated more refined measurements. The main outputs include first of its kind measurements of the Pa-alpha line and spatially resolved spectral line profile measurements of the Pa-beta line. In the visible range ELM-resolved Balmer and impurity emission profile measurements at high spatial resolution were obtained using a new filtered camera system. A detailed assessment of the diagnostic scope for parameter estimation from both high-n and low-n Balmer and Paschen series lines is presented, underpinned by a parametrised line profile model which captures the relevant broadening and splitting mechanisms, including the Zeeman, Stark and Doppler processes.

This paper compares {{different methods}} of diagnosing eddy mixing rates in an idealized, eddy-resolving model of a channel flow meant to resemble the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The first set of methods, the “perfect” diagnostics, are techniques suitable only to numerical models, in which detailed synoptic data is available. The perfect diagnostic include flux-gradient diffusivities of buoyancy, QGPV, and Ertel PV; Nakamura effective diffusivity; and the four-element diffusivity tensor calculated from an ensemble of <b>passive</b> tracers.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} original diagnostic {{investigations of}} atmospheric pressure gaseous discharges, operating in owing helium and helium with low concentrations (0. 1 - 1 %) of gas admixtures, together with novel biomedical surface functionalisations. The initial body {{of this work}} focuses on comprehensive electrical and optical diagnostics of the operation of an industrial scale dielectric barrier discharge (DBD), maintained in a 10 l/min w of both helium and helium with 1 % admixed oxygen. The experimental results reveal a coupling between the power dissipated in the discharge and the discharge homogeneity which, in turn, correlates to {{a shift in the}} power supply operating frequency and species optical emission intensities. The shift in the operating frequency is shown to be dependent upon increased charge deposition on the electrodes, as the input power is increased, thus changing the overall system capacitance through charge-voltage LIssajous gure analyses. Furthermore it is demonstrated that the gas temperature did not exceed approximately 380 - 410 K over the full parameter space, in the helium discharge, through model tting of the rst negative system of the N+ 2 band around 391. 4 nm. A real-time, PC based monitoring diagnostic system has been developed which is used to perform long term analyses of a laboratory DBD chamber in helium and helium with 0. 1 % admixtures of both oxygen and nitrogen. Post analysis of the results, through multivariate analysis of the large experimental datasets, show that rapid system characterisations are faciltated using this method, the outcomes of which are compared with both global and uid model outputs within the literature. <b>Passive</b> acoustic <b>diagnostics</b> of a plasma jet system, together with signal analysis in the time, frequency and time-frequency domains are explored. Here it is found that ow induced mode transitions from buoyant, through laminar, to turbulent regimes may be identied using time-frequency scalogram plots. It is shown that the scalogram plots may also be used to identify the point at which power coupling together with the plume length are maximised. The transition into a fully turbulent plume structure is shown to be accompanied by low frequency acoustic signals which modulate the acoustic rst harmonic in the time-frequency domain. Moreover, a non invasive measurement of the power coupled into the discharge is demonstrated through passive acoustic sensing whilst the jet ow is laminar. Finally, surface modications of disposable plastics for biosensor applications are performed. In this work it is shown that the density of packing of both 40 nm and 80 nm gold nanoparticles may be tailored, through variation of the gas input ow rate of a linear eld jet, in order to enhance the optical signal according to the Mie theory for light extinction at a metal nanoparticle interface. The functionalisation using long chain polethyleneglycol has also been demonstrated to provide a protein repellent surface for non-specic protein binding reduction...|$|R
40|$|Digital {{spectral}} analysis of signals based on DFT {{has a number}} of advantages. However, the transition from analog to digital methods and techniques is accompanied by a number of undesirable effects. Signals in each subject area usually have their own specifics. Therefore, it is necessary to study these effects in applications of spectral Fourier analysis. Such research is important for three reasons. Firstly, DFT properties are accurate, have their own specificity and significantly differ from the properties of the Fourier transform of continuous signals. Secondly, signals in each subject area have their own specificity. Thirdly, researchers often have prevailing knowledge in some particular domain, rather than in the field of digital signal processing techniques. As a result, in practice, some of the processes and effects arising in applications of digital {{spectral analysis}}, unfortunately, escape the attention of researchers which can result in erroneous conclusions. The paper deals with the problems of measuring Fourier spectrum of signals in the base of discrete exponential functions. Methods and algorithms of sliding measurements of energy Fourier spectrum of signals on finite intervals were described. The invariance of current energy Fourier spectrum to moving discrete real signals (which are not periodic) were investigated. The authors identify a new effect of digital spectral analysis — the effect of non-invariance of the current energy Fourier spectrum. Theoretical and practical results of analysis of invariance of current energy Fourier spectrum of tonal components are shown. The conducted studies allow us: — to see in a new light the measurement results on finite intervals of current Fourier spectrum and the current energy Fourier spectra of signals; give a numerical estimate of the non-invariance of the current energy Fourier spectrum of real tonal components. — to increase the effectiveness of digital spectral analysis in its many applications, in particular, for solving the problems on detection and identification of hidden periodicities in such subject areas as radar, vibroacoustic <b>diagnostics,</b> <b>passive</b> sonar, biomedicine, etc...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is intended to investigate the effects of fuel properties, injection strategy and timing on autoignition and combustion characteristics of a Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine with a negative valve overlap (NVO) strategy. Conventional (pressure-transducer based) measurements and passive optical research have contributed to understanding of the chemical-physical sites of HCCI autoignition and combustion. This experimental work was undertaken on matching thermal and optical single cylinder research engines in configurations derived from a production Jaguar V 8 engine. A thermal engine study using a range of fuels including conventional gasoline and primary reference fuels has been performed to gain insight into autoignition and combustion characteristics of various chemically dissimilar blends or components. This was done at different operating conditions by varying the engine speed {{and the proportion of}} residuals trapped. These measurements have shown that the autoignition and combustion characteristic of an HCCI operated engine are highly dependent on fuel blend composition and are also affected by engine operating conditions. It was found that the autoignition process type which the mixture undergoes, whether it is one- or two-step, depends very strongly both on fuel blend composition and on engine operating conditions. More specifically the presence and also proportion of particular chemical compounds in a blend could significantly contribute to the alteration of the process type. Similar experiments using the chosen engine operating points were repeated on the optical engine using <b>passive</b> optical <b>diagnostics</b> such as imaging and spectroscopy. Thereby it was possible to gain insight into the chemistry of one-step and two- step ignition processes. The image analysis of the port fuel injected (PFI) HCCI operation have been carried out for stoichiometric and lean conditions. A crank-angle resolved high-speed imaging technique was employed a piston crown window for optical access to the combustion chamber. The spatial repeatability nature of autoignition occurrence and the directions of combustion progress were evaluated using especially developed image processing technique. The insight into the expansion rates of burned areas and of the spreading velocities of reacting structures fronts was also gained by introducing two new image processing techniques. Various direct injection strategies (single and split injection) and timings, including fuel injection prior to and during the negative valve overlap period were optically investigated. The comprehensive study included the application of three diagnostic instruments: the Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) high-speed colour imager, the intensified Charge Couple Device (CCD) and the imaging spectrograph. Among the other observations the applied passive techniques, the imaging and the spectroscopy in conjunction with adequate image processing techniques have shown that the combustion behaviour and also the colour of the burning mixture are dependent on the fuel injection scheme. With the investigated split (double) injection, when some of fuel is injected prior to TDC NVO the combustion behaviour is significantly different than when it is injected during even at TDC (NVO). There is a strong indication that a form of incandescence occurs during the NVO, which probably comes from the glowing soot. This is further supported by a quantification of the emitted luminescence and spectroscopic measurements during this phase...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{the patient}} as an active partner in health care, {{and not just a}} <b>passive</b> object of <b>diagnostic</b> testing and medical treatment, is widely accepted. Providing {{information}} to patients is considered a crucial issue and the central focus in patient educational activities. It is necessary to educate patients {{on the nature of the}} outcomes and the benefits and risks of the procedures to involve them in the decision-making process and enable them to achieve fully informed consent. Information materials must contain scientifically reliable information and be presented in a form that is acceptable and useful to patients. Given the mismatch between public beliefs and current evidence, strategies for changing the public perceptions are required. Traditional patient education programmes have to face the potential barriers of storage, access problems and the need to keep content materials up to date. A computer-based resource provides many advantages, including “just-in-time” availability and a private learning environment. The use of the Internet for patient information needs will continue to expand as Internet access becomes readily available. However, the problem is no longer in finding information, but in assessing the credibility and validity of it. Health Web sites should provide health information that is secure and trustworthy. The large majority of the Web sites providing information related to spinal disorders are of limited and poor quality. Patient Line (PL), a patient information section in the Web site of Eurospine, was born in 2005 to offer patients and the general population the accumulated expertise represented by the members of the society and provide up-to-date information related to spinal disorders. In areas where evidence is scarce, Patient Line provides a real-time opinion of the EuroSpine membership. The published data reflect the pragmatic and the common sense range of treatments offered by the Eurospine membership. The first chapters have been dedicated to sciatica, scoliosis, cervical pain syndromes, low back pain and motion preservation surgery. Since 2008, the information has been available in English, German, French and Spanish. The goal is for Patient Line to become THE European patient information Web site on spinal disorders, providing reliable and updated best practice and evidence-based information where the evidence exists...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{landmarks}} in immunology was {{the invention}} {{and development of}} monoclonal antibody-secreting hybridomas by Milstein and his coworkers. The enormous promise of monoclonal antibody technology, which became apparent soon after its discovery, may explain the unusual speed with which monoclonal antibodies have been applied to biological and medical sciences. In animal production monoclonal antibodies are increasingly finding application {{in the areas of}} <b>diagnostics,</b> <b>passive</b> immunization and fundamental research. In Chapter 1 of this thesis some applications of monoclonal antibodies within these areas, with emphasis on reproduction, are discussed. It has been concluded that the particular advantages of monoclonal antibodies can firstly and most easily be shown in immunodiagnosis. Once a hybridoma producing a monoclonal antibody appropriate for a particular application has been obtained, large amounts of a homogeneous and reliable reagent are available {{for as long as they}} are needed. As ingredients in test kits, monoclonal antibodies have rapidly replaced conventional polyclonal antibodies. An example of a typical diagnostic test in animal production in which monoclonal antibodies might be used is the milk-progesterone test for confirmation of oestrus and pregnancy diagnosis in cattle. In Chapter 2 the production and characterization of monoclonal antibodies against progesterone have been described in order to standardize an enzyme immunoassay for milk-progesterone. The antibodies differed considerably in their binding affinity for progesterone and showed distinct specificities for a variety of steroids. Results show that, although the technique of monoclonal antibody production selects antibodies specific for a single antigenic determinant, this does not always preclude the possibility of cross-reactivity. Moreover, most antibodies produced have affinities far below the corresponding conventional antisera, as has been discussed in Chapter 1. The monoclonal antibody with the highest association constant and relatively good specificity did not detect progesterone with any greater sensitivity than the conventional polyclonal sera. However, since monoclonal antibodies avoid the dependency upon animals producing high quality antisera and improve test standardization, a commercially available rapid progesterone cow-side test has been designed based on the monoclonal antibody with the best characteristics. Results of Chapter 2 underline the necessity to evaluate carefully the need of producing monoclonal instead of polyclonal antibodies for a given antigen, as considerable time and effort are required to obtain a monoclonal antibody with suitable properties. Preselection of antibodies on affinity and specificity in an early stage makes the monoclonal antibody technology more efficacious. In our laboratory a cocktail of related steroids was used to enable such an early selection of antibodies against either oestrone or oestrone sulphate. Testing the replacement of oestrone, coupled to horse- radish peroxidase, from the antibodies made it possible to produce high affinity monoclonal antibodies with nearly unique specificities in a relatively short time. Experiments are in progress to develop a test for pregnancy diagnosis in pigs in faecal samples based on those antibodies. Another application in diagnostics is the use of monoclonal antibodies against a male-specific protein, the H-Y antigen, for sexing bovine embryos before implantation. H-Y is a weak antigen and immunization with H-Y antigen in an inbred strain of mice usually results in production of low titered, low affinity antisera. Because only a low percentage of mice has a good antibody response and their sera run out quickly, monoclonal antibodies were produced (Chapter 3). Male specificity of the antibodies was tested in a variety of assays including enzyme immunoassays based on various sources of soluble H-Y and indirect immunofluorescence assays based on binding of the antibodies to H-Y antigen on the cell surface of male and female cells obtained from a number of tissues and species. Several monoclonal antibodies appeared to be positive in all assays tested, suggesting that the molecule conferring the H-Y antigenicity lacks speciesspecificity and appears to be identical for soluble and membrane-bound H-Y antigen. The most promising monoclonal antibodies reactive with the H-Y antigen have been evaluated for their efficiency in sexing Day 7 bovine preimplantation embryos (Chapter 4). Although in an indirect immunofluorescence assay a discrimination between male and female embryos could be made, evaluation of the staining patterns was fairly subjective because of non-specific binding of the monoclonal antibodies to the embryonic cells. After modifying the technique in order to reduce non-specific binding, the number of false positives after sexing under these conditions was greatly reduced, which suggests that the monoclonal antibodies detect a male-specific antigen. It was concluded that the occurrence of false-negative embryos might be caused by a weak expression of the H-Y antigen and/or a low affinity of the monoclonal antibody for bovine cell-surface H-Y antigen. The antibodies used in our experiments had been selected on basis of their binding to both soluble and cell-surface H-Y antigen originating from different sources. Currently, monoclonal antibodies which are selected on high affinity for protein structural determinants on bovine cell-surface H-Y antigen are being produced in order to be used in a highly discriminating sensitive fluorescence assay. In Chapter 1 has been discussed that it will take some time to fully realize the potential of monoclonal antibodies in the area of passive immunization or immunomodulation. The production costs are still relatively high and the reaction of the animal to the injected antibodies may limit the effects of passive immunization. Some such limitations are illustrated in the experiments in which anti- progesterone murine monoclonal antibodies were administered to cyclic pigs (Chapter 5). Intravenous injection of increasing amounts of anti- progesterone antibodies resulted in a concomitant rise in levels of antibody-bound progesterone. At the same time a significant rise in plasma concentrations of total progesterone was observed immediately after administration of higher doses of antibodies. Therefore, the net effect of progesterone binding by the antibody was relatively small and more or less independent of the quantities of antibody administered. It has been suggested that animals maintain adequate levels of free progesterone in their circulation by resorption of progesterone from a pool present in body tissues. The effects of administration of anti-progesterone antibodies on plasma levels of free progesterone are, however, not only influenced by the proposed compensating effect of resorption, but also by the possible initiation of a humoral response of the pigs to the injected antibodies. In the experiments described in Chapter 5 it is shown that a minimum dose of 32 mg anti-progesterone antibody elicited an antimouse response after the first injection, having an neutralizing effect on the anti-progesterone monoclonal antibodies administered with the second injection. When smaller quantities of antibody were used, an anti-mouse reaction was detected after the second or third injection. From reports concerning the therapeutic use of monoclonal antibodies in man it is known that such an immune response may be directed partially against the isotypic determinants, partially against the idiotypic determinants of the murine antibodies administered. Although anti- idiotypic responses cannot be excluded as a complicating factor, homologous antibodies might offer some advantages over their murine counterparts in terms of effectiveness for passive immunization. In Chapter 6 the construction of a bovine-murine heteromyeloma cell line to be used for the production of bovine monoclonal antibodies has been described. It was anticipated that a heteromyeloma would retain the superior fusion characteristics of the mouse myeloma cells and, because of the presence of bovine chromosomes, would be better able to support stable bovine antibody production than interspecies hybridomas produced by fusing mouse myeloma cells with bovine lymphocytes. First (bovine-murine) and second generation (bovine-[bovine-murine]) fusion partners were compared for fusion efficiency and the generated number of antigen- specific antibody-producing clones. In addition, the optimal time- interval between boosting and harvesting of the lymphocytes for fusion and the source of lymphocytes was studied. It could be concluded that fusion of bovine lymph node cells with the second generation heteromyelomas on Day 7 after the final booster injection resulted in the largest number of specific antibody-producing clones. Experiments with a third generation bovine-murine heteromyeloma cell line indicated that fusion efficiency could be further improved (unpublished data). Studies with anti-rotavirus and anti-pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin (PMSG) bovine monoclonal antibodies, produced with the second generation fusion partners, indicate that the heteromyeloma cell lines are very useful for the production of bovine monoclonal antibodies. The availability of such bovine monoclonal antibodies offers the possibility to compare the efficacy of homologous and heterologous antibodies in cattle after repeated passive immunization. The in vivo immunoneutralization of PMSG by murine and bovine monoclonal antibodies was chosen as a model for such a study (Chapter 7). Results indicate that repeated injection of murine monoclonal antibodies against PMSG (mMCA) alone did not, or only to a small degree, elicit an anti-mouse immune response. The simultaneous administration of mMCA and PMSG resulted in relatively high levels of anti-mouse antibodies after the second injection, leading to a decrease in neutralizing activity of mMCA. The results suggest that the neutralizing activity of mMCA is inhibited more by anti- idiotypic than by anti-isotypic antibodies against mMCA. After repeated administration of the bovine monoclonal antibody against PMSG (bMCA), either alone or in combination with PMSG, no anti-bMCA antibodies could be detected. In addition, no change in plasma levels of bMCA and PMSG, compared with levels after the first injection, was observed. Although it has to be confirmed by further experiments whether our findings can be generalized, the present results suggest that for repeated passive immunization in cattle homologous antibodies are to be preferred above heterologous antibodies. As far as we can see now it is necessary to evaluate carefully the need to produce homologous or heterologous antibodies, dependent on the amounts of antibody to be administered and the number of treatments. In conclusion, the potential of monoclonal antibodies for diagnostic use, therapy or fundamental research, discussed in Chapter 1, together with the results presented in this thesis indicate that the monoclonal antibody technology will have an important impact on the improvement of animal quality and productivity. ...|$|R
