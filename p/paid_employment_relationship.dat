40|$|Background: Unpredictable spells of epileptic {{seizures}} {{would result}} in embarrassment in society and have some {{negative impact on the}} patients’ social activities. The aim {{of this study was to}} show the perceived impact of epilepsy by patients on different aspect of their social activities including occupation, marriage and education. Materials and Methods: We studied 179 epileptic patients age 16 years and over with face to face interview. Nine domains including relation to spouses, relation to family members, social life, general health, interpersonal communications and friendships, feelings about success, hope for future, ordinary life and cope with others were considered. Results: One hundred and seven men and 72 women were studied. Nearly 78 % of the patients had generalized tonic-clonic seizures. More than half of the patients believed that epilepsy had affected their social life and activities. General health was negatively affected by this disease more than any other item; this may be due to uncontrolled spells or taking medications. About 15. 5 % of married and 39 % of the single patients considered epilepsy as an obstacle to marry with their ideal spouses and more than half of the employed persons considered epilepsy as an obstacle for their job promotions. Conclusion: Epilepsy frequently impact on several aspects of life. The disease negatively affects social lives and activities, overall health, feelings about self, ability to work in <b>paid</b> <b>employments,</b> <b>relationship</b> with spouses, friends, and other family members, future plans, standards of living and ambitions of epileptic patients. Decreasing such impacts should be considered as an important part of treatment and proper management can certainly increase various aspects of life in these patients...|$|R
40|$|Information {{literacy}} {{self-efficacy and}} academic motivation are both argued to play {{important roles in}} student academic development. The former {{is considered to be}} a predictor of student academic achievement while the latter is considered a key factor in developing information literacy self-efficacy. Today,many students undertake <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> in conjunction with their academic studies and little is known about the effect this may have on their information literacy self-efficacy and academic motivation. As such, the relationship between information literacy self-efficacy, academic motivation, and employment has been unexplored. Data were collected via a questionnaire, comprised of existing scales, which was administered to undergraduate business students in an Australian higher education (HE) institution. A response rate of 58 % resulted in 585 completed questionnaires. Findings suggest that whether or not students were engaged in <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> did not appear to influence information literacy self-efficacy, although students in <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> did exhibit significantly lower intrinsic motivation than students not in <b>paid</b> <b>employment.</b> Additionally, for students not in <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> a significant <b>relationship</b> was found between amount of time spent on study and information literacy selfefficacy. Of some concern, the small amount of time students reported spending in academic pursuits outside of scheduled classes raises issues regarding the placement of information literacy instruction. For information literacy practitioners this study contributes to awareness regarding the conceptualization of information literacy instruction and its placement in the HE environment.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: {{to assess}} {{the quality of life}} after {{successful}} intervention among patients with varying degrees of lower-limb ischaemia in comparison with healthy controls and the respondents>> degree of sense of coherence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: one hundred and twelve patients and 102 healthy controls were assessed for quality of life (Nottingham Health Profile) and sense of coherence. MAIN RESULTS: successful angioplasty or surgical intervention led to an improved quality of life at 6 months, in particular with regard to pain, sleep, physical mobility, hobbies and holiday and to a level similar to healthy controls in sleep, social isolation, <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> and family <b>relationships.</b> It remained at a significantly lower level than that of healthy controls with regard to pain, emotional reactions, physical mobility, energy, housework, hobbies, holidays, sex and social life. Critical ischaemia patients did not reach the same level of quality of life as the claudicants or the healthy controls. CONCLUSION: successful treatment for chronic limb ischaemia improved the quality of life significantly, more so in claudicants than in patients with critical ischaemia. The degree to which the quality of life improved was associated with the patients>> sense of coherence and their ankle pressure...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{explored the}} experiences of care leavers, who lived in institutions (such as Children's Homes and orphanages) {{or other forms of}} out-of-home care between 1930 and 1989. Participants included representatives of three sub-cohorts: Forgotten Australians, members of the Stolen Generations and Child Migrants. Employing mixed methods, this research used three forms of data collection: surveys (n = 669), interviews (n = 92) and focus groups (n = 77). This research concentrated on participants’ experiences in care, leaving care, life outcomes after care (education, employment, health, wellbeing and relationships), coping strategies and resilience, current service needs and usage and participation in organisations as well as the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. Most participants experienced extreme neglect and abuse while in care. Leaving care, often after years of institutionalisation, was generally a frightening and demoralising process. Despite these challenges, a number of participants demonstrated remarkable resilience. For many, however, these experiences had negative consequences in adulthood including serious physical and mental health problems. This often made adult learning, <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> and positive <b>relationships</b> virtually impossible. Most survivors carry high levels of trauma and complex unmet needs. Implications for policy, practice and services are drawn from key findings...|$|R

40|$|Objective : We explore whether women's <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> is {{associated}} with reductions in women's stated son preference in India and whether these results vary by employment sector (agriculture, manufacturing, services, professional-technical) and skill level (education and literacy). Methods : We conduct a logistic regression analysis of the <b>relationship</b> between women's <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> and women's stated son preference among a sample of never-pregnant Indian women. We use the 2005 India National Family Health Survey (NFHS). Results : Women's <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> in the service and manufacturing sectors {{is associated}} with significant reductions in the stated son preference of low-skilled women (i. e., low education and literacy). However, this negative association goes away for women at higher skill levels. In fact, <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> in manufacturing {{is associated with}} significantly higher stated son preference among university-educated women. However, women's <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> in agriculture and the professional-technical sectors is not significantly associated with women's stated son preference. Finally, the association between women's <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> and stated son preference is significantly larger for women living in north India than for women living in south and east India. Conclusions : We hypothesize that significant negative associations between women's <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> and women's stated son preference occur only in cases where <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> changes the economic status of women within the family. Contribution : Our analysis demonstrates that there are important linkages between women's <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> and stated son preference, and draws attention to how the context of employment (e. g., sector and skill level) is differentially associated with demographic outcomes...|$|R

30|$|Being {{asked about}} their {{attitude}} towards career advancement self-employed women significantly more often stated high career aspirations than women in <b>paid</b> <b>employment,</b> namely 58 percent vs. 47 percent (which is even higher than the share of 54 percent of male self-employed stating high career aspirations). This may indicate that women with high career aspirations choose self-employment because <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> does not provide them with satisfactory career opportunities (e.g., because {{of the existence of}} a “glass ceiling”), whereas women who attach less importance to career advancement (and more to family-work balance) stay in <b>paid</b> <b>employment.</b> Looking at family background, we find no substantial differences in terms of living with a partner and presence of young children (aged 0 – 5) in the household between self-employed women and women in <b>paid</b> <b>employment.</b>|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This article {{presents}} findings from a scoping review {{that sought to}} highlight {{what is known about}} pre-registration <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> practices of undergraduate nursing students. Background: Researchers have identified large numbers of undergraduate nursing students engaging in <b>paid</b> <b>employment.</b> This review was prompted by our interest in the different employment choices that students make and whether these choices have any impact on transition to practice. Design: A scoping review was designed to map the existing evidence base on undergraduate student nurse employment practices. Scoping reviews support the identification of a broad range of literature, which encompasses all types of study design. Data sources: Utilising key search terms, databases searched included MEDLINE, CINAHL, Psych INFO, EMBASE, SCOPUS, SCIRUS, Joanna Briggs Institute, Web of Science, Informit Health and the Cochrane database. Review method: We utilised Arksey and O'Malley's five-stage approach: identifying the research question; identifying relevant studies; study selection; charting the data; and collating, summarising and reporting the results. Based on the research question, relevant literature was selected which was reported in accordance with Arksey and O'Malley's framework. Results: The scoping review identified 40 articles that explored the nature of undergraduate student nurse <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> activity. Highlighted themes included: reasons for engaging in paid employment; specific <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> models; <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> and academic performance, and <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> choice and transition to graduate practice.

40|$|The recent {{phenomenon}} that {{high numbers of}} full-time students in the UK participate in term time <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> has become {{a feature of the}} current higher educational landscape. A major contributory factor is the revised funding for higher education, placing a higher portion of the funding onto the individual. While student <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> is seen in many Western societies, the structure of a full-time degree in the UK means there is a much higher workload for academic studies. This has given rise to concerns that alongside the beneficial aspects of <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> are negative connotations, which impact on academic achievement and student experience. These concerns are associated with equality and student retention. This research considers the impacts of <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> for full-time students, whether there are characteristics in the employment that facilitate any detrimental impacts, whether there are vulnerable groups in the student population that will be most affected by these. The study used a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods, surveys to consider what is happening, interviews and diaries to examine why this is happening. The study acknowledged beneficial aspects to student <b>paid</b> <b>employment,</b> but also identified negative impacts to both academic studies and the student experience. These were associated particularly with term time <b>paid</b> <b>employment,</b> in addition to the amount of hours undertaken. Social class was also identified to contribute, with student time management a major issue. Parental contributions are becoming increasingly important to students to fund their degree. A relatively new concept of social contracts between students and their parents appears to be evolving over recent years, making them become joint agents within the decision-making and choices students are making regarding <b>paid</b> <b>employment.</b> Data analysis is utilised to make recommendations for government, policymakers and universities regarding how negative impacts may be minimised...|$|R

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Psychology. Early withdrawal (attrition) from college is a common and costly problem to individuals and institutions of higher learning. First-generation (FGEN) college students, whose parents have not attended college, comprise a large faction of enrollees and are particularly at risk for attrition. Because attrition is over-represented among FGEN students, they are a potential target group for decreasing attrition rates, provided the phenomenon of college attrition in this group is understood. The present study estimated the effects of a number of factors on college attrition, in 3, 290 FGEN and non-FGEN students over four years, using event-history analysis. Results showed that, FGEN students were indeed more likely to leave college than their non-FGEN peers. Equally important, ACT scores, scholarships, college grade point averages and amount of time devoted to <b>paid</b> <b>employment</b> mediated the <b>relationship</b> between FGEN status and attrition. Some additional psychological variables predicted attrition among all students, such as drug and alcohol use, psychological distress and few reported academic challenges.
