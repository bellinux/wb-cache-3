This stress is particularly associated with high gravity processes which utilise concentrated 16 substrates to yield products with elevated concentrations of ethanol. The aims of this work were to quantitatively 17 measure factors affecting extracellular osmotic pressure (osmolality) during brewing fermentations, and to 18 determine their effects on yeast at the physiological and molecular level.

Functional products containing elevated levels of bioactive compounds are attracting considerable attention due to their potential to {{lower the risk of}} chronic diseases and their associated huge healthcare costs. On a global scale, there is an increasing demand for berries and fruits, since they are natural polyphenol-rich raw material to be incorporated into functional foods, nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals.

However, many of such systems still lack {{the capacity to}} obtain a complete profile of the gas production pattern {{or the ability to}} provide parameters that describe the patterns of gas production. Consequently, these models do not exploit the full potential for providing insights into the attributes of the resulted fermentation patterns. To date still there is no rigorous presentation that includes the outputs from gas, pressure and temperature sensors, while considering the effect of vented gases. Here, we introduce a versatile and scalable fermentation model for describing gas production processes. This new model uses a novel mass-flow equation for comprehensive profiling of the gases produced. The performance of this model is demonstrated by revealing the gas kinetic patterns that resulted when fecal matter, together with highly fermentable fiber, was incubated in an in-vitro system. The new model shows differences of up to 7 % and 9. 1 % in cumulative gas production and gas production rate, respectively, with respect to existing methods The model provides the first comprehensive solution for gas production profiling by accurately taking into account the measured data from gas, pressure and temperature sensors for common fermentation systems that can potentially be of great importance for analyzing incubation units...|$|R

40|$|Fermentation {{of organic}} {{materials}} by microorganisms {{is an essential}} component {{in a variety of}} medical, industrial and agricultural applications. Many of these fermentations take place in quasi-closed <b>pressure</b> regulated anaerobic <b>fermentation</b> systems and involve the production of different gases. These gases are highly indicative as they are identifiable with biological processes and different bacteria species. Profiling gas components in such systems can assist with their microbial activities analysis, diagnosis and monitoring. However, methods for gas profiling in such fermentation systems lack real-time, accurate, simple, portable and cost-effective gas profiling technologies for continuously measuring gases in both anaerobic headspaces and in liquid media. The aim of this PhD research is to enhance the understanding, diagnosis and monitoring of these systems and their associated applications using gas components. This was specifically achieved by resolving the limitations and inadequacies of gas profiling in quasi-closed <b>pressure</b> regulated anaerobic <b>fermentation</b> systems. Firstly, the author of this thesis thoroughly reviewed the methods utilized for accurate profiling of gas components. Specifically, he focused on profiling intestinal gases produced in-vitro during fecal incubation. Secondly, the author investigated the calculation methods for profiling the production of these gases and their kinetics. Finally, the author explored gas profiling in both liquid and gas phases for in-situ monitoring of anaerobic digestion fermentation systems. The first stage involved addressing limitations of profiling intestinal gases produced by incubation of fecal matters in-vitro. The past available technologies for sensing colonic gases in-vitro were either bulky, expensive, offline or included only limited number of gas types. In addition, the gut environment in-vitro is generally simulated with N 2 as an inert gas where the supplementation of important fermentation gases, such as CO 2 and H 2, was not understood. As such, the author developed a low-cost, portable and real-time gas sensing technology for monitoring CO 2, CH 4, H 2, H 2 S and NOx simultaneously in the anaerobic headspace of fecal fermentation systems in-vitro. The author demonstrated the performance of the new technology on healthy human fecal samples and validated the new technology for both accuracy and reproducibility. The author also explored the impact of the initial headspace environment composition on the fermentation gas profiles. It was found that supplying the reactor with CO 2 enhanced CH 4 and H 2 production and inhibited H 2 S production. Furthermore, it was shown that fecal incubation together with high fermentable fibre could suppress H 2 S production. Finally, the author found that healthy human fecal samples did not produce NOx spontaneously. In the second stage, the author investigated the calculation methods for profiling the production of gases and their kinetics in quasi-closed <b>pressure</b> regulated anaerobic <b>fermentation</b> systems. Surprisingly, the author discovered that there was no existing standardized or comprehensive method for such calculations. Therefore, the author developed a rigorous gas fermentation model and a novel mass-flow equation for accurately profiling the produced gases and introduced these into the literature. This new model was designed to match the commonly used commercial fermentation systems, making the new technology readily available for many applications and studies. The author demonstrated the performance of the new model for human fecal sample incubation using the in-vitro technology developed in the first stage and validated its accuracy. Moreover, the author found that the contribution of newly introduced components in the mass-flow equation exceeded 9. 1 % of the overall gas profile. In the final stage, the author researched the monitoring capability of anaerobic digestion processes using in-situ measurements of gas components in both liquid and gas phases. As {{an integral part of the}} microbial activity of anaerobic digestion processes, gas components have the potential of providing the necessary information for monitoring such processes effectively. However, current technologies for gas sensing in liquid-phase have been inadequate. Previously, Real-time profiling of gas components in both phases simultaneously has not been thoroughly studied due to lack of the required technology. This has possibly hindered important insights about the system&rsquo;s health. In order to conduct this research, the author developed a novel, relatively simple, low-cost technique for measuring gas components in both phases simultaneously. Using this technique, dissolved gases were measured in-situ using membrane protected gas sensors which, in comparison to other approaches, eliminated many complications, delays or sample contamination. The author demonstrated the performances of the new technology on a series of anaerobic digestion batch experiments and confirmed its accuracy, longevity and reproducibly. Utilizing the new technique, the author identified patterns and signatures that were associated with process imbalances but not clearly observed in commonly used indicators such as volatile acids and pH. The author also explored the impact of inoculum age on the process and showed that, relative to freshly collected inoculum, processes using aged inoculum had a higher potential to enter imbalanced states and failure. It is the position of this author that the insights and technological advances achieved in this PhD research have contributed significantly to the advancement of the field of anaerobic fermentation. In particular, this was achieved by creating new, simple, accurate and reliable technologies, while adding significantly to the knowledge of quasi-closed, <b>pressure</b> regulated anaerobic <b>fermentation</b> systems and their applications...|$|R

40|$|Coconut (Cocos nucifera L) {{water is}} found in {{abundance}} in Desiccated Coconut (DC) factories {{and it is the}} main constituent in the wastewater from DC industry. DC effluent does not meet the water discharge standards and has to be treated prior to the discharge. Coconut water contains sugars and nutrition but limited in industrial application due to its low concentration. The aim of this work is to explore the possibilities of value addition to waste coconut water from DC industry and cutting down the load on wastewater treatment plants. Two main coconut cultivating regions (north-west and south) were selected for sample collection. Coconut water volume per coconut was examined and statistical values of coconut consumption from DC factories were used to calculate coconut water discharged daily and annually from DC industry. Average coconut water volume per coconut found to be 124 ml. Total sugar concentration was used to calculate the total amount of sugar available in coconut water from the DC industry. The total sugar concentration in coconut water is low (North western region 32. 6 g/l, Southern region 19. 5 g/l), which will result low efficiency if used as the sugar source in fermentation. Hence, it was decided to improve the sugar concentration of coconut water obtained from the DC industry using evaporation. Evaporation was carried out at three pressure levels (47. 4 kPa, 101. 3 kPa and 198. 6 kPa) into four concentration levels. The effect of evaporation on the total sugar content was evaluated. Main drawback of evaporative concentration of coconut water was the thermal degradation of sugar ranging from 0. 12 % to 18 %. During evaporation acidity and insoluble solids of the coconut water increased. The concentrated coconut water was fermented into ethanol with a good efficiency. Volume reduction level of 5 was sufficient to achieve sugar consumption efficiencies about 89 % and evaporation could be carried out at atmospheric <b>pressure.</b> The <b>fermentation</b> efficiency had marginally dropped with the increase of the volume reduction level and the increase in temperature and pressure used for evaporation process. A significant drop in the fermentation efficiency was observed with high sugar concentrations and in the presence of inhibitors such as HMF and furfural which may be formed at high temperature evaporation to achieve high volume reduction levels. The annual coconut water wasted in DC industries was estimated to be about 36. 3 million. However, the estimated producible pure ethanol amount from an average DC factory was estimated to be 50 - 60 kg per day. Hence concentration followed by fermentation may not be an economical option for DC factories if pure ethanol is produced as the final product. However, there is a high potential for producing alcoholic beverage using waste coconut water from DC industry...|$|R
