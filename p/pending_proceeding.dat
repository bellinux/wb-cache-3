40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} effort is to provide an understanding of customer value, the process of customer value creation and delivery focused on Trade Finance (TF) in financial services. For customers of trade finance, {{it is important that}} the service effectively provides customer value. Service offerings are intangible and increasing value to meet customers’ expectations like price, quality and tailored services are essential to customer value strategy in trade finance. The identification of the critical attributes of customer value will be useful to serve as a guide for trade finance provider to upgrade their current service standards. From the literature, customer value dimensions such as delivery of services, branding of service provider, procedural and advisory services have emerged from quality and performance, and price for value of money(Zeithaml, 1988; Holbrook, 1994). To achieve the above purpose, an exploratory study was conducted by way of qualitative data through interviews. Data collected revealed some pattern of important factors that influence the choice of trade financing over other types of financing offered by competitors. The research confirms that trade financing is the preferred financing because of its many benefits which contribute to customer value. Among these are settlement of purchases <b>pending</b> <b>proceeds</b> of payment; get payment discounts for early settlement; cost of interest in TF is cheaper than overdraft; double savings with rebates from suppliers and lower cost of interest. The existence of such features and elements establish the superiority of one trade finance service provider above another. Limitations the researcher faced in conducting interviews for this research are that in-depth interviews are not objective but prone to biasness. The area of research is confined to Ipoh and Klang Valley. Also, one has to recognize the varied challenges offered by the type of trade finance i. e. local or international versus payment terms, nature of goods, financier’s ability to mitigate transaction risk, ability and knowledge of financier to advise customer to seek certain documentary evidence to assist their customer to emerge as a winner. Cross border transactions have their own challenges, complexities and risks...|$|R

50|$|Although the Court {{had been}} briefed {{regarding}} whether the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment were {{applicable to the}} restaurant, the majority opinion noted that both the City of Baltimore and Maryland had passed laws against racial discrimination by an owner or operator of a place of public accommodation. The state antidiscrimination statute went further and forbade discrimination in public accommodations for sleeping or eating {{on the basis of}} race, creed, color, or national origin. The opinion, consistent with the Court's practice when a significant supervening change in law has occurred, vacated the criminal convictions of the students and remanded the case back to the Maryland Court of Appeals to allow it to consider whether the convictions should be dismissed under the current state law. The Court noted that the common law of Maryland held that when the legislature has repealed a criminal statute or otherwise makes conduct that once was a crime legal, a state court would dismiss any <b>pending</b> criminal <b>proceeding</b> charging such conduct. Lastly, the majority opinion noted that Maryland had a savings statute, which preserves criminal convictions and penalties when criminal statutes are amended, reenacted, revised, or repealed unless the legislation implementing the amendment, reenactment, revision, or repeal expressly provided that such convictions or penalties should be reduced or vacated. However, the Court did not believe that the Maryland savings statute would be applicable to the new antidiscrimination statute.|$|R

40|$|Poorly written {{rules for}} {{specialized}} services or managed services, {{a category of}} services recognized in the FCC’s 2010 Open Internet Order, could turn the <b>pending</b> Open Internet <b>proceeding</b> into a farce.

There are people who {{seem to believe that}} any service from an Internet service provider (ISP) that has a quality of service (QoS) that is different from standard Internet service must be a specialized service, and that specialized services are exempt from all Open Internet rules.

Imagine that an ISP offers a new service that complements its standard Internet service. If the new service has a different QoS from standard Internet, then the new service is labeled a specialized service and there are no applicable Open Internet Rules to break. On the other hand, if the new service has the same QoS as standard Internet, then there is probably no discrimination going on, which means there is also no chance that the ISP has violated antidiscrimination rules. There is a similar problem if specialized services are exempt from all rules, and if any service that carries traffic from just one application type is considered a specialized service.

The new K7 had a vertical stabiliser (also from a Gnat Campbell had purchased [...] ) and a new hydraulic water brake designed to slow the boat down on the five-mile Coniston course.The boat returned to Coniston for trials in November 1966. These did not go well; the weather was appalling and K7 destroyed her engine when the air intakes collapsed under {{the demands of the}} more powerful engine, and debris was drawn into the compressor blades.

Problems with the fuel system meant that the engine could not develop maximum power. By the middle of December, Campbell had made a number of timed attempts, but the highest speed achieved was 264 mph, and therefore still shy of the existing record.

40|$|The {{distinctive}} {{character of the}} European Union (EU) is indisputable. May it be denoted as a supranational or as a sui generis organization (which is a preferred designation of the European Court of Justice), it {{is considered to be}} the result of particular features pertaining to the competences, structure and decision making-process of the EU. It is a truism that other international intergovernmental organizations do share some or all of these features. Almost all of them have at least one institution which is obliged to act independently of the member states; at least some of their decisions are rendered by majority voting, at least some of which are legally binding. What makes the EU truly and genuinely a unique phenomenon in the field of inter-state organization is a strong and independent judicial system, established to 'ensure that in the interpretation and application of this treaty the law is observed'. In effect, it implies establishing a strong and independent judicial system able to enforce the EU law against all those who are under its domain and, above all, to enforce it against the EU Member States. In order to enable the European Court of Justice (the Court of Justice, the General Court and specialized courts) to perform this duty, the Court has been conferred a range of specific powers under the provisions of the Treaty on the European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in particular. The Court is empowered to declare that a Member State has failed to comply with its obligation under the Treaties. The founding fathers of the EU designed three different procedures leading to that effect. The first one has proved to be fairly effective; on the grounds of an action brought by the Commission, it enables the Court to adjudge whether a Member State did comply with its obligations stemming from the EU law. The next one provides légitimation active for the other Member State but it has been very rarely used in the whole history of EU integration and can hardly be considered effective. The last one, possibly the most effective in terms of the accomplishment of the Court's paramount goal, enables the Court to respond to questions referred to the Court by national courts about the effect of EU law in cases pending before the national courts. Having in mind that the procedure before the Court is just part of the litigation <b>proceeding</b> <b>pending</b> in the national court, in this analysis we will set aside the preliminary ruling procedure and focus on the so-called direct actions: Commission v. Member state, and Member State v. Member State. In this paper, we will also focus on Member State's légitimation active versus EU institutions. The founding treaties provide for the procedures that enable Member States to initiate judicial review of the EU institution compliance with EU law. The action for annulment, the action for failure to act, and the claims relating to compensation for damage caused by the EU institutions or its civil servants in performance of their duties proved to be effective tools for keeping the EU institutions within the limits of competences coffered upon them by the Treaties. In view of the extensive legislative powers which the Treaties have vested in political institutions and given the fact that their scope has been a matter of great controversy, légitimation active of a Member State has proved to be an important element of a sophisticated and balanced system of judicial control...|$|R
