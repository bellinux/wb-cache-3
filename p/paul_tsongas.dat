5|$|For {{much of his}} {{business}} career, Romney did not take public, political stances. He had kept abreast of national politics since college, though, and {{the circumstances of his}} father's presidential campaign loss had irked him for decades. He registered as an Independent and voted in the 1992 presidential primaries for the Democratic former senator from Massachusetts, <b>Paul</b> <b>Tsongas.</b>|$|E
5|$|With no presidential ambitions left, Kennedy {{formed a}} good {{relationship}} with Democratic President Bill Clinton upon the latter taking office in 1993, despite his having initially backed former fellow Massachusetts Senator <b>Paul</b> <b>Tsongas</b> in the 1992 Democratic presidential primaries. Kennedy floor-managed successful passage of Clinton's National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 that created the AmeriCorps program, and despite reservations supported the president on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). On the issue Kennedy cared most about, national health insurance, he supported but was not much involved in formation of the Clinton health care plan, which was run by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and others. It failed badly and damaged the prospects for such legislation for years to come. In 1994, Kennedy's strong recommendation of his former Judiciary Committee staffer Stephen Breyer played a role in Clinton appointing Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court. During 1994 Kennedy became the first senator with a home page on the World Wide Web; the product of an effort with the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, it helped counter the image of Kennedy as old and out of touch.|$|E
25|$|From 1952 to 1988, {{the person}} elected {{president}} had always carried the primary, but Bill Clinton broke the pattern in 1992, as did George W. Bush in 2000, and Barack Obama in 2008. In 1992, Clinton lost to <b>Paul</b> <b>Tsongas</b> in New Hampshire; in 2000, George W. Bush lost to John McCain in New Hampshire; and in 2008 Barack Obama lost to Hillary Clinton in the New Hampshire primary.|$|E
50|$|He {{was not a}} {{candidate}} for reelection to the Ninety-eighth Congress in 1982. After retiring from Congress, he continued to donate to Democrat campaigns, including to Senator Russ Feingold's and <b>Paul</b> <b>Tsongas's</b> campaigns in 1992. Mrs. Reuss was a bigger and more active donor to Democrats and related groups.|$|R
50|$|Democratic Democratic Congressman <b>Paul</b> E. <b>Tsongas</b> {{was elected}} over {{incumbent}} Republican Edward Brooke.|$|R
50|$|He {{was elected}} to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1978, {{succeeding}} <b>Paul</b> E. <b>Tsongas,</b> who ran successfully for the United States Senate. Shannon was reelected in 1980 and 1982.|$|R
25|$|After the {{successful}} performance by U.S. and coalition {{forces in the}} Persian Gulf War, President George H.W. Bush's approval ratings were 89%. His re-election was considered very likely. As a result, several high-profile candidates, such as Mario Cuomo, refused to seek the Democratic nomination. In addition, Senator Al Gore refused to seek the nomination {{due to the fact}} his son was struck by a car and was undergoing extensive surgery as well as physical therapy. However, Tom Harkin, <b>Paul</b> <b>Tsongas,</b> Jerry Brown, Bob Kerrey, Douglas Wilder and Bill Clinton chose to run as candidates.|$|E
25|$|In 1974 Richardson {{gave the}} {{commencement}} address at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and received an honorary Doctors of Law. In 1980, Richardson received an honorary degree from Bates College. In 1983, Richardson was admitted as an honorary {{member of the}} Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati. In 1984, {{he ran for the}} Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by <b>Paul</b> <b>Tsongas.</b> Although Richardson was favored to win the seat, he was defeated in the GOP primary by more conservative candidate Ray Shamie, who lost the general election to John F. Kerry.|$|E
25|$|U.S. Senator Tom Harkin (Iowa) ran as {{a populist}} liberal with labor union support. Former U.S. Senator <b>Paul</b> <b>Tsongas</b> (Massachusetts) {{highlighted}} his political independence and fiscal conservatism. Former California Governor Jerry Brown, {{who had run}} for the Democratic nomination in 1976 and 1980 {{while he was still}} Governor, declared a significant reform agenda, including Congressional term limits, campaign finance reform, and the adoption of a flat income tax. Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey was an attractive candidate based on his business and military background, but made several gaffes on the campaign trail. Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton positioned himself as a centrist, or New Democrat. He was still relatively unknown nationally before the primary season. That quickly changed however, when a woman named Gennifer Flowers appeared in the press to reveal allegations of an affair. Clinton rebutted the story by appearing on 60 Minutes with his wife, Hillary Clinton.|$|E
50|$|The United States Senate {{election}} of 1978 in Massachusetts {{was held on}} November 7, 1978, with the incumbent Republican Senator Edward Brooke being defeated by then Democratic Congressman <b>Paul</b> E. <b>Tsongas.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Paul</b> Efthemios <b>Tsongas</b> ( [...] ; February 14, 1941January 18, 1997) was an American {{politician}} and a United States Senator from Massachusetts from 1979 to 1985, {{who had served}} as a U.S. Representative from Massachusetts's 5th congressional district (1975-1979) and in local political office. He won seven states as a candidate in the 1992 Democratic presidential primaries, losing the nomination to Bill Clinton.|$|R

25|$|Lowell, even as {{far back}} as the 1860s, was {{described}} as a city with little civic pride. At the time, Cowley attributed it to a large percentage of the population being foreign born and therefore having no real roots there. Post its industrial collapse, that sentiment intensified, even if the reasons had changed. Many residents of Lowell viewed the city's industrial history poorly - the factories had abandoned their workers, and now sat empty and in disrepair. However, some city residents, such as educator Patrick J Mogan, viewed the city's history as something that should be preserved and capitalized on. In 1974, Lowell Heritage State Park was founded, and in 1978, Lowell National Historical Park was created as an urban national park, through legislation filed by Lowell native, congressman, and later senator <b>Paul</b> <b>Tsongas.</b> The canal system, many mills, and some commercial structures downtown were saved by the creation of the park and the visitors it brought.|$|E
25|$|Despite poor showings in the Iowa caucus (1.6%) and the New Hampshire primary (8%), Brown soon {{managed to}} win narrow {{victories}} in Maine, Colorado, Nevada, and Vermont, {{but he continued}} {{to be considered a}} small threat for much of the campaign. It was not until shortly after Super Tuesday, when the field had been narrowed to Brown, former Senator <b>Paul</b> <b>Tsongas</b> of Massachusetts, and front-runner then-Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, that Brown began to emerge as a major contender {{in the eyes of the}} press. On March 17, Brown forced Tsongas from the race when he received a strong third-place showing in the Illinois primary and then defeated the senator for second place in the Michigan primary by a wide margin. Exactly one week later, he cemented his position as a major threat to Clinton when he eked out a narrow win in the bitterly fought Connecticut primary. As the press focused on the primaries in New York and Wisconsin, which were both to be held on the same day, Brown, who had taken the lead in polls in both states, made a gaffe: He announced to an audience of various leaders of New York City's Jewish community that, if nominated, he would consider the Reverend Jesse Jackson as a vice-presidential candidate. Jackson, who had made a pair of anti-semitic comments about Jews in general, and New York City's Jews in particular, while running for president in 1984, was still mistrusted within the Jewish community. Jackson also had ties to Louis Farrakhan, infamous for his own anti-semitic statements, and with Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Brown's polling numbers suffered. On April 7, he lost narrowly to Bill Clinton in Wisconsin (37%–34%), and dramatically in New York (41%–26%).|$|E

50|$|He was {{a strong}} proponent of adding a {{comprehensive}} prescription-drug benefit to the U.S. Medicare and consistently opposed attempts to privatize the Medicare program.

500|$|In {{the first}} primary contest, the Iowa Caucus, Clinton {{finished}} a distant third to Iowa Senator Tom Harkin. During {{the campaign for}} the New Hampshire primary, reports surfaced that Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers. Clinton fell far behind former Massachusetts Senator <b>Paul</b> <b>Tsongas</b> in the New Hampshire polls. Following Super Bowl XXVI, Clinton and his wife Hillary went on 60 Minutes to rebuff the charges. Their television appearance was a calculated risk, but Clinton regained several delegates. He finished second to Tsongas in the New Hampshire primary, but after trailing badly {{in the polls and}} coming within single digits of winning, the media viewed it as a victory. News outlets labeled him [...] "The Comeback Kid" [...] for earning a firm second-place finish.|$|E
500|$|Tsongas interned in Arlington, Virginia, {{for presidential}} {{candidate}} Eugene McCarthy during summer 1967; {{at a party}} while there she met <b>Paul</b> <b>Tsongas,</b> then an aide to Republican Congressman Brad Morse. In 1969, she married Paul; they had three daughters: Ashley, Katina, and Molly. A politician, Paul served in the House from [...] from 1975 to 1979, and the Senate from 1979 to 1985. After being diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Paul declined to seek a second term in the Senate; he resigned the day before his term expired. Tsongas moved their family from Washington, D.C., back to Massachusetts to care for Paul as he underwent treatments. After seemingly being cured of his disease, in 1992 Paul ran for the Democratic Party nomination for President; he came in third behind former California Governor Jerry Brown and eventual winner Bill Clinton. Paul's cancer later returned; he died of pneumonia and liver failure on January 18, 1997.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton's presidential primary campaign, Emanuel was {{appointed}} to direct the campaign's finance committee. Emanuel insisted that Clinton schedule time for fundraising and delay campaigning in New Hampshire. Clinton embarked on an aggressive national fundraising campaign that allowed the campaign to keep buying television time as attacks on Clinton's character threatened to swamp the campaign during the New Hampshire primary. Clinton's primary rival, <b>Paul</b> <b>Tsongas</b> (the New Hampshire Democratic primary winner), later withdrew, citing a lack of campaign funds. Richard Mintz, a Washington public relations consultant who worked with Emanuel on the campaign, spoke about the soundness of the idea: [...] "It was that [...] million dollars that really allowed the campaign to withstand the storm we had to ride out in New Hampshire [...]" [...] Emanuel's knowledge of the top donors in the country, and his rapport with [...] "heavily Jewish" [...] donors helped Clinton amass a then-unheard-of sum of $72 million. While working on the Clinton campaign Emanuel was a paid retainer of the investment bank Goldman Sachs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{winner in}} New Hampshire {{has not always}} gone on to win their party's nomination, as {{demonstrated}} by Republicans Leonard Wood in 1920, Harold Stassen in 1948, Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. as a write-in candidate in 1964, Pat Buchanan in 1996, and John McCain in 2000, and Democrats Estes Kefauver in 1952 and 1956, <b>Paul</b> <b>Tsongas</b> in 1992, [...] Hillary Clinton in 2008, and Bernie Sanders in 2016..|$|E
2500|$|Bill Clinton {{was able}} to declare himself the [...] "Comeback Kid" [...] after posting a {{surprise}} second-place finish behind <b>Paul</b> <b>Tsongas</b> in the Democratic primary. Clinton's support had been flagging for weeks since being hit by allegations of infidelity with actress Gennifer Flowers. On the Republican side, Pat Buchanan garnered an unexpected 37% showing behind incumbent President George H. W. Bush. Buchanan did not win a single state, but revealed some doubts about the moderate president among conservative voters.|$|E
2500|$|The Boston Globe {{wrote that}} [...] "if there's one school that can {{lay claim to}} educating the nation's top {{national}} leaders {{over the past three}} decades, it's Yale". Yale alumni were represented on the Democratic or Republican ticket in every U.S. Presidential election between 1972 and 2004. Yale-educated Presidents {{since the end of the}} Vietnam War include Gerald Ford, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush, and major-party nominees during this period include Hillary Clinton (2016), John Kerry (2004), Joseph Lieberman (Vice President, 2000), and Sargent Shriver (Vice President, 1972). Other Yale alumni who made serious bids for the Presidency during this period include Howard Dean (2004), Gary Hart (1984 and 1988), <b>Paul</b> <b>Tsongas</b> (1992), Pat Robertson (1988) and Jerry Brown (1976, 1980, 1992).|$|E
2500|$|Specific {{individuals}} {{have been identified}} with Atari Democrats.

[...] Gary Hart also referred to himself as an Atari Democrat and stated, [...] "I was, early on in my Senate career, described as an Atari Democrat.

2500|$|The {{primary season}} began with U.S. Senator Tom Harkin winning his native Iowa as expected. <b>Paul</b> <b>Tsongas</b> of Massachusetts won the New Hampshire primary on February 18, but Clinton's second-place finish, helped by his speech {{labeling}} himself [...] "The Comeback Kid," [...] energized his campaign. Jerry Brown won the Maine caucus and Bob Kerrey won South Dakota. Clinton {{won his first}} primary in Georgia. Tsongas won the Utah and Maryland primaries and a caucus in Washington. Harkin won caucuses in Idaho and Minnesota while Jerry Brown won Colorado. Bob Kerrey dropped out two days later. Clinton won the South Carolina and Wyoming primaries and Tsongas won Arizona. Harkin dropped out. Jerry Brown won the Nevada caucus. Clinton swept {{nearly all of the}} Super Tuesday primaries on March 10 making him the solid front runner. Clinton won the Michigan and Illinois primaries. Tsongas dropped out after finishing 3rd in Michigan. Jerry Brown, however, began to pick up steam, aided by using a 1–800 number to receive funding from small donors. Brown scored surprising wins in Connecticut, Vermont and Alaska. As the race moved to the primaries in New York and Wisconsin, Brown had taken the lead in polls in both states. Then he made a serious gaffe by announcing to an audience of New York City's Jewish community that, if nominated, he would consider Reverend Jesse Jackson as a Vice Presidential candidate. Clinton won dramatically in New York (41%–26%) and closely in Wisconsin (37%–34%). Clinton then proceeded to win a long streak of primaries leading up to Jerry Brown's home state of California. Clinton won this primary 48% to 41% and secured the delegates needed to clinch the nomination.|$|E
