Bodies are interred in the burial ground outside but commemorative stones made of Carrara marble are inside the mausoleum. The corbels on the internal oak roof are embellished with angel figurines.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{leadership}} of Heinz-Christian Strache, the FPÖ has focused on describing itself as a Heimat and social party. This means that the party promotes {{its role as a}} guarantor of Austrian identity and social welfare. Economically, it supports regulated liberalism with privatisation and low taxes, combined with support for the welfare state; however, it maintains that it will be impossible to uphold the welfare state if current immigration <b>policies</b> <b>are</b> continued.|$|E
5|$|In Africa, the HIV/AIDS {{pandemic}} {{has been}} the major cause of falling life expectancy. There is currently a crisis of decreasing number of available care workers for an increasing population requiring care. One reason why this phenomenon occurs is because HIV/AIDS affects working age people the most, {{and there has been}} evidence to show that women are affected at a younger age and in greater numbers. Another reason is due to the influx of HIV/AIDS, government-led health <b>policies</b> <b>are</b> breaking down, increasing the amount of care work and community work that women have to do. Because of the lack of care workers available, the very young and the very old have also started participating in care work, resulting in poorer quality of care.|$|E

5|$|Member states remain optimistic of {{the union}} and key {{partners}} in the region, namely China, Iran, Turkey remain interested in it. A common belief is that the Eurasian Economic Union has significant potential {{over the next two}} decades, with experts predicting a 25 percent growth in the member states' GDP by 2030, which equates to over US$600 billion. The agreement will give member state citizens access to employment and education across the union. It will also entail collaborative policies in many sectors, including agriculture, energy, technology and transportation. These collaborative <b>policies</b> <b>are</b> particularly interesting for countries in Asia seeking access to energy, trade routes in Central Asia and Siberia, and agricultural goods.|$|E
5|$|Modern authors like Ernesto Palacio, Norberto Galasso, and Jorge Abelardo Ramos {{attempt to}} rescue the image of Moreno by {{avoiding}} both extremes: the sweet liberal Moreno and the horrible one written by revisionists. Those historians do not consider Bernardino Rivadavia a successor of Moreno, and the proposals to seek an alliance with Britain are not seen {{as the product of}} anglophilia, but just an example of the limited options available to the Primera Junta. Similarly, they do not attribute much influence to the Representation..., considering it a mere work for a client that didn't really influence Cisneros, who would have allowed free trade for international contexts. The harsh <b>policies</b> <b>are</b> acknowledged, but not attributed specifically to Moreno, but rather to the whole Junta, and compared with similar royalist measures used to punish the Chuquisaca, the La Paz revolution, and the indigenous rebellion of Túpac Amaru II.|$|E
5|$|The Moderate Party has a pro-European Union policy stance—including {{support for}} exchanging the SEK for the Euro—and also {{supports}} Sweden joining NATO. As one of Europe's new conservative leaders, Reinfeldt {{is seen as}} an important ally of the United States. His party {{is a member of the}} conservative International Democrat Union, together with the Republican Party in the United States and the British Conservative Party, even though its <b>policies</b> <b>are</b> somewhat more liberal than these. During the 2000 United States presidential election, Reinfeldt visited the United States to support the campaign of George W. Bush. Prior to the 2004 United States presidential election, Reinfeldt again expressed his support for Bush. In an interview with the newspaper Stockholm City on 8 March 2004, Reinfeldt said that he preferred Bush over the Democratic Party contender John Kerry, and in a poll conducted by the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet in April 2004, Reinfeldt like a large majority of his party favoured Bush over Kerry.|$|E

5|$|Together, the Permanent Members {{form the}} North Atlantic Council (NAC), a body which meets {{together}} {{at least once}} a week and has effective governance authority and powers of decision in NATO. From time to time the Council also meets at higher level meetings involving foreign ministers, defence ministers or heads of state or government (HOSG) and it is at these meetings that major decisions regarding NATO's <b>policies</b> <b>are</b> generally taken. However, it is worth noting that the Council has the same authority and powers of decision-making, and its decisions have the same status and validity, at whatever level it meets. France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States are together referred to as the Quint, which is an informal discussion group within NATO. NATO summits also form a further venue for decisions on complex issues, such as enlargement.|$|E

50|$|Various {{approaches}} to policy analysis exist. The analysis for policy (and/or analysis of <b>policy)</b> <b>is</b> the central approach in social science and educational <b>policy</b> studies.

The approach of analysis for policy refers to research conducted for actual policy development, often commissioned by policymakers inside the bureaucracy (e.g., senior civil servants) {{within which the}} <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> developed. Analysis of <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> more of an academic exercise, conducted by academic researchers, professors and think tank researchers, who are often seeking to understand why a particular <b>policy</b> <b>was</b> developed {{at a particular time}} and assess the effects, intended or otherwise, of that <b>policy</b> when it <b>was</b> implemented.|$|R
