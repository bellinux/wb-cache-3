5|$|After {{seeing a}} vision of Stoller being stabbed in her car, Black warns her that she may be in danger, which she rebukes. However, she is {{approached}} by another patient, Purdue (Michael Massee), who insists that Edward is stealing dreams, but will not steal his. Watts researches the facility's inmates to find who has committed stabbings in the victims' cars, concluding that Purdue is the one this profile fits. Black attempts to warn Stoller, but she has already driven away from the hospital. Black gives chase, scaring her, and she out-paces him before <b>pulling</b> <b>into</b> a filling station. However, the attendant alerts Stoller that someone is hiding {{in the back seat}} of her car, and manages to bring her to the safety of his office. Black arrives and finds the car empty. He drives Stoller back to the hospital while the attendant attempts to call the police. However, he is killed before making the call.|$|E

25|$|On September 11, 2001, {{the station}} was shut down by the Port Authority after the first {{airplane}} hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center. In the minutes after the first plane hit at 8:46am, three PATH trains were <b>pulling</b> <b>into</b> the station. One was arriving from Newark and two others from Hoboken. The first Hoboken train turned around without stopping, not letting off passengers or opening any doors. The second Hoboken train arrived on track 3 at 8:52 a.m., was ordered to be evacuated, employees included. This train never left the World Trade Center complex and was found later in 2001 during the long recovery process. The train from Newark that came into the terminal at 8:55 a.m. stopped only to pick up passengers. An empty train {{was sent to the}} station at 9:10 a.m. to pick up a dozen PATH employees and a homeless individual, leaving the station empty.|$|E

25|$|Shefflin {{made his}} senior {{competitive}} debut for Kilkenny on 21 February 1999 in a 0-14 to 1-9 league defeat by Cork. That campaign ended at the semi-final stage, however, Shefflin retained his {{place on the}} starting fifteen for the subsequent championship, making his provincial debut in a 6-21 to 1-14 semi-final trouncing of Laois. Kilkenny later faced Offaly in the provincial final. A huge 5–14 to 1–16 victory over their near rivals and reigning All-Ireland champions gave Kilkenny the win and gave Shefflin a first Leinster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland decider saw Kilkenny face Cork on 12 September 1999. In a dour contest played on a wet day, Cork trailed by 0-5 to 0-4 after a low-scoring first half. Kilkenny increased the pace after the interval, <b>pulling</b> <b>into</b> a four-point lead. Cork moved up a gear and through Joe Deane, Ben O'Connor and Seánie McGrath Cork scored five unanswered points. Kilkenny could only manage one more score – a point from a Shefflin free – and Cork held out to win by 0-13 to 0-12.|$|E
25|$|Talbot {{struck again}} at 10:07 in the period, as he curled the puck to fake a pass during a two-on-one break, then lifted it over Osgood's shoulder. The play began with Chris Kunitz {{splitting}} the Detroit defence with a pass {{in his own}} zone, allowing Talbot and Tyler Kennedy to move in on an odd man rush. The Penguins attempted to play conservatively {{in the third period}} and registered only one shot in the frame. At the same time, Detroit was able to sustain pressure on several occasions during the period. At 13:53, the Red Wings got on the board, as Jonathan Ericsson drilled a one-timed slapshot behind Fleury from near the blue line, after receiving a pass from Niklas Lidstrom. Then, at 17:45, Detroit came within inches of <b>pulling</b> <b>into</b> a tie. However, Niklas Kronwall's wristshot from the right circle ricocheted off of Jordan Staal, hit the crossbar, then bounced away from any Red Wing skaters. Detroit gained one last chance on the final shift of the game. After stopping an initial Henrik Zetterberg shot from the right faceoff circle, the rebound came loose to Nicklas Lidstrom at the left faceoff circle, forcing Fleury to make a diving stop with two seconds remaining to preserve the win and the championship. Pittsburgh's Evgeni Malkin was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy after the game as the Most Valuable Player of the 2009 playoffs, becoming the first Russian born player to win the trophy.|$|E
500|$|For {{the next}} few years LRT-1 {{operations}} ran smoothly. In 2000, however, employees of METRO Inc. went on strike, paralyzing LRT-1 operations from July 25 to August 2, 2000. [...] Consequently, the LRTA did not renew its operating contract with METRO Inc. that expired on July 31, 2000, and assumed all operational responsibility. [...] At around 12:15pm on December 30, 2000, a bomb—later learned to have been planted by Islamic terrorists—went off in the front coach of a LRT-1 train <b>pulling</b> <b>into</b> Blumentritt station, killing 11 and injuring over 60people in the most devastating of a series of attacks that day, now known as the Rizal Day bombings.|$|E

500|$|On 22 March 2016, a fatal {{accident}} occured off Pasir Ris MRT station. Two of SMRT's track-maintenance trainee staff were lethally {{run over by}} an approaching C151 at a signalling box of the station. They {{were part of a}} technical team of 15 staff led by a supervisor and were asked {{to go down to the}} tracks to investigate an alarm triggered by a possible signalling equipment fault close by Pasir Ris station. The operator said the team had permission to access the tracks, but did not coordinate with a signal unit in the Pasir Ris station control to ensure train captains in the area where the team was exercised caution while <b>pulling</b> <b>into</b> Pasir Ris Station. This incident resulted in a 2.5 hour service delay between Tanah Merah and Pasir Ris Stations, affecting at least 10,000 commuters.|$|E
500|$|On 24 July 1940, almost 40 Bf 109s of III./JG 26 {{took off}} for {{operations}} over the English Channel—a phase of the battle known as the Kanalkampf. They were met by 12 54 Squadron Spitfires. The Spitfires forced the larger number of Bf 109s into a turning battle that ran down the Germans' fuel. Galland recalled being impressed by the Spitfire's ability to outmanoeuvre Bf 109s at low speed and to turn into the Bf 109s within little airspace. Only by executing a [...] "Split S" [...] (a half-roll onto his back, followed by <b>pulling</b> <b>into</b> a long, curving dive) that the Spitfire could not follow without exceeding its maximum safe speed and risking structural failure, could his aircraft escape back to France at low altitude. The II./Jagdgeschwader 52 covered their retreat, losing two Bf 109s to Spitfires from No. 610 Squadron. During the action, two Spitfires were shot down {{for the loss of}} four Bf 109s. Galland was shocked by the aggression shown by pilots he believed to be relatively inexperienced. Galland later said he realised there would be no quick and easy victory.|$|E
500|$|At 09:15 the straggling {{rear of the}} British {{squadron}} {{began to}} arrive, led by the flagship HMS Caesar, which anchored ahead of Audacious and inshore of Venerable before opening fire on Desaix. At 09:20, HMS Hannibal under Captain Solomon Ferris joined the action, anchoring ahead of Caesar. This left only HMS Spencer under Captain Henry Darby unengaged: Spencer had been left becalmed {{to the south of}} Isla Verda and came under heavy fire from the batteries and towers, some of which were firing shells hot shot designed to start fires in the ship's timbers. Captain Jahleel Brenton on Caesar suggested to Saumarez that if he negotiated with the Spanish they might permit him to seize the French ships in exchange for a cessation of the action, but Saumarez dismissed the idea as premature. At 10:12, with Formidable <b>pulling</b> <b>into</b> shallower waters away from the attacking British ships, Saumarez sent orders to Captain Ferris on Hannibal instructing him to manoeuvre his ship closer inshore to attack Formidable more effectively: specifically he was told to [...] "go and rake the French admiral". Ferris began by sailing slowly northwards, using the light winds to pull ahead of the combat before tacking back towards Formidable. The manoeuvre was initially successful, but at 11:00, as he passed the Torre de Almirante, Hannibal grounded. From this position, Ferris was able to direct part of his broadside onto Formidable and the rest against the Spanish shore defences, but his ship was left very vulnerable to fire from the shore.|$|E
