40|$|This paper investigates {{why some}} Australian {{households}} use <b>paid</b> help with <b>domestic</b> labor while others do not. Consistent with earlier studies, the analysis examines hypotheses relating to resources, objective demand, and gender attitudes. Additionally, this paper examines {{the impact of}} attitudes toward using <b>paid</b> <b>domestic</b> labor, {{an area that has}} not been investigated previously. The findings suggest that resources and objective demand provide the parameters within which employing household help is made possible or necessary, but beliefs about the appropriateness of this strategy also play a role in determining whether Australian households use <b>paid</b> <b>domestic</b> labor. The paper concludes that understanding whether Australian households pay for domestic help is dependent not just on the level of resources and objective demand but also on whether individuals view <b>paid</b> <b>domestic</b> help as an appropriate strategy for undertaking <b>domestic</b> work. <b>Paid</b> <b>domestic</b> labor, housework, attitudes, gender, JEL Codes: J 12, J 16, J 22,...|$|R

40|$|There {{is now a}} large {{literature}} {{documenting the}} significance of <b>paid</b> <b>domestic</b> work as a sector of employment for women (Gregson and Lowe 1994; England and Steill 1997). In this article I focus on {{the ways in which}} gender hierarchies intersect with those of caste in the organisation of <b>paid</b> <b>domestic</b> work in a village on the outskirts of Delhi, India. The article has two broad aims. First, I seek to examine some {{of the ways in which}} <b>paid</b> <b>domestic</b> work is organised in India and highlight the social stratification that is central to the organisation of such work. I focus on part-time <b>paid</b> <b>domestic</b> work in which the tasks performed and the organisation of labour have specific spatial dimensions and are based on the caste division of labour. Part-time <b>paid</b> <b>domestic</b> workers usually live in their own households and visit the employer's house once or twice a day to perform the tasks for which they are paid. They often work in more than one house. Thus, part-time implies that the domestic worker's labour and time are not exclusively available to one employer, unlike the case of full-time domestic workers. Secondly, the article explores some aspects of the gendered re-negotiation of these tasks following urbanisation...|$|R

40|$|In industrialised {{countries}} most of {{the goods}} and services traditionally undertaken in the home are now largely sourced outside the household. The main exceptions are childcare, food preparation and washing and cleaning, which can be unpaid work or can be undertaken on a paid basis: this is <b>paid</b> <b>domestic</b> work. The ILO estimates that there are over 100 million domestic workers globally. These workers are often the most disadvantaged and vulnerable and, in many countries, are migrants, sometimes working illegally and sometimes part of guest worker schemes. Most domestic workers internationally are women. In New Zealand, domestic work was once an important source of paid employment for women with shortages of workers met by migration from the British Isles. While it had almost disappeared as a paid occupation post World War II, a number of reasons suggest a likely {{increase in the number of}} <b>paid</b> <b>domestic</b> workers in the near future, probably met, again, by migration. Nevertheless, little is known about New Zealand <b>domestic</b> workers, and <b>paid</b> <b>domestic</b> work fits uncomfortably with labour law, principally because the workplace is the private home. This has meant that overall, <b>paid</b> <b>domestic</b> work has, in a variety of ways, been a private matter in New Zealand. However, we suggest that it is time that <b>paid</b> <b>domestic</b> work is viewed as a public policy issue, particularly in relation to labour law and migration policy development...|$|R

Departing from the dominant tendency in studies of <b>paid</b> <b>domestic</b> work to focus on relationships between female employers and workers, the article addresses the role of male domination and patriarchal family structures within employing families in the sexual exploitation of domestic workers by male employers. Using materialist feminist approaches, the article argues that domestic workers&# 039; experiences should be seen as embedded in the patriarchal environment created by male household heads who appropriate the labor of other household members, including wives, children and <b>paid</b> <b>domestic</b> workers. The sexual exploitation of domestic workers is then analyzed as being a result of the appropriation of women&# 039;s entire personhood by men within the relationship of sexage outlined by Colette Guillaumin...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} <b>paid</b> <b>domestic</b> work by adult {{national women}} in Mexico City and Rabat. I have used secondary data and new fieldwork to look Into the context {{and implications of}} the social organization of this occupation from a gender and class perspective. The fieldwork includes 36 interviews in each city; I interviewed only women as they still are primarily responsible for domestic/care work. In each city 12 women <b>paid</b> <b>domestic</b> workers, 12 women employers, and 12 women employed who do not hire domestic workers were interviewed. The research was operationalized around seven main questions which looked into {{the legal status of}} <b>paid</b> <b>domestic</b> work and its weight in the active population; at why women employ or become household workers and how all groups perceive the occupation and the relationships in place. Finally I have looked into the challenges in securing 'decent work' for <b>paid</b> <b>domestic</b> workers. The interviews reveal recurrent patterns in the social relations of <b>paid</b> <b>domestic</b> work in the two cities. According to the fieldwork domestic employees were unable to exercise choice and took this occupation as a last resort due mainly to pressures of poverty. Their conditions of employment fall in general far from 'decent work' standards and upward mobility is possible very rarely. Household work is generally perceived as a lesser occupation for which no skills are needed. Among the employers interviewees, the decision to employ a <b>paid</b> <b>domestic</b> worker was influenced more by their ability to pay their wages and by their personal histories than by pressures of trying to combine employment and care. In both Mexico and Morocco this occupation is historically linked both to servitude and to the unpaid work of women belonging to subordinate classes. This background has hindered the elimination of a fracture regarding rights and social protection between household workers and other workers. The attitudes of employers appear likely to be a major barrier to on-going, although fragmented, attempts to introduce and implement legislation that would eliminate these gaps. Although there are differences in the practice of domestic work in Mexico-City and Rabat, the occupation is in both a belittled occupation. From a women, workers and human rights perspective the advancement of rights for this category of workers as well as the elimination of gaps between them and other workers are issues of major relevance.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{challenges}} surrounding organizing of <b>paid</b> child <b>domestic</b> {{workers have}} been relatively under-explored. This study is about the strategies and challenges of the union (CHODAWU) and the NGO (KIWOHEDE) in organizing <b>paid</b> child <b>domestic</b> workers in Tanzania. The study attempts to analyse the institution of <b>paid</b> <b>domestic</b> work, in particular <b>paid</b> child <b>domestic</b> work. In many countries, domestic service has been predominantly done by adult domestic workers, quite often foreign immigrants or intra-imigrants from rural areas to urban centers. In Tanzania the situation is quite different. The dominant work force in domestic service are children often with very low or basic primary education, a majority of whom come from poor rural families. Experience has shown that organizing of such child domestics is challenging. The trade union (CHODAWU) and the NGO (KIWOHEDE) have tried to organize <b>paid</b> child <b>domestics</b> without any tangible progress. This study attempted to assess the roles and strategies that the NGOs and unions use in organising <b>paid</b> child <b>domestic</b> workers. It also examines the different challenges facing both the NGOs and the unions in organising <b>paid</b> child <b>domestics.</b> The field {{interviews were conducted with}} the Union 2008 in Dar es Salaam city, the capital city of Tanzania. In terms of the research methodology, the study used both primary and secondary sources of data collection. The field research was conducted to the officials of the two selected organisations KIWOHEDE (NGO) and CHODAWU (local union) in Dar es salaam city. Among other things the study found that despite their differences in structures, composition, goals and roles, both the union and the NGO use similar strategies in organising <b>paid</b> child <b>domestic</b> workers. i. e they use provision of vocational skills and training as the means to reach and interact with the domestic workers. It was also found that there is no clear and unified legal position on the definition of a child domestic worker {{as well as on the}} employment status of the same. This legal ambiguity creates one of the more potent challenges for organising...|$|R

40|$|<b>Paid</b> <b>domestic</b> labour in China revived in {{the early}} 1980 s after the state began its {{transition}} from a socialist centrally planned economy to a socialist market-oriented economy. This dissertation focuses on what happened to gender relations as well as class equality {{in the wake of}} the development of private domestic service during this economic transition. Using a socialist feminist framework, the analysis of the current marketization of domestic labour is situated in both the context of global capitalism and the reconfigured nature of patriarchy under neoliberal governance, albeit in a socialist state. The current market-oriented labour system and specifically <b>paid</b> <b>domestic</b> workers’ situation in China can be understood through the inter-related nature of emerging capitalist markets, and historical patriarchal institutions related to both state socialism and the family. This dissertation analyzes the ways that market reforms in China have affected women and the state and their relationship to <b>paid</b> <b>domestic</b> work. The consequences of the marketization of various aspects of domestic life that used to have a more communal character have radically changed social reproduction responsibilities and have put them even more squarely on women in the private sphere. Economic and state policy changes related to social reproduction create both the new supply of and demand for <b>paid</b> <b>domestic</b> work. Based on interviews with domestic workers, their employers, their social advocates, and government officials, this investigation examines the economic and social security of domestic workers and provides information about their precarious work circumstances that could be improved through public policy. China is rapidly reconfiguring its regime of social reproduction and is in a period when new policy needs to be considered: the economic and social securities that had been provided by the pre-reform social reproduction regime are substantially weakened through the marketization of domestic labour...|$|R
