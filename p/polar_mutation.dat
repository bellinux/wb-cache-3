40|$|A PRM-cI-lacZ fusion {{inserted}} into the b 2 region of bacteriophage λ was used to isolate mutations affecting expression of both the λ cI gene and the lacZ gene. One such mutation, {{a change in the}} cI initiator codon from AUG to AUA, reduces immunity of a λ prophage to superinfection, and causes a 60 - 70 % reduction in β-galactosidase synthesis, even when repressor is supplied in trans. The effect of the mutation on lacZ gene expression is eliminated in a rho- bacterial strain, and the mutation has no effect on transcription initiated at PRM in vitro. Therefore, the effects of the mutation are due to premature ρ-dependent termination of transcription in the absence of translation of the cI gene, as if the mutation were a nonsense <b>polar</b> <b>mutation...</b>|$|E

The partial revertant PsU 5 /R 2 I regained wild-type levels of all enzymes except the aldehyde dehydrogenase.

40|$|AbstractMutations of the cystic {{fibrosis}} transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) cause CF disease by altering the biosynthesis, maturation, folding and ion conductance of this protein. Our laboratory {{has focused on}} expression and structural analysis of the CFTR transmembrane (TM) domains using two-TM segments (i. e., helix–loop–helix constructs) which we term ‘helical hairpins’; these represent the minimal model of tertiary contacts between two helices in a membrane. Previous studies on a library of TM 3 / 4 hairpins of the first CFTR TM domain suggested that introduction of non-native polar residues into TM 4 can compromise CFTR function through side chain-side chain H-bonding interactions with native Q 207 in TM 3 [Choi, M. Y., Cardarelli, L., Therien, A. G., and Deber, C. M. Non-native interhelical hydrogen bonds in the {{cystic fibrosis}} transmembrane conductance regulator domain modulated by polar mutations, Biochemistry 43 (2004) 8077 – 8083]. In the present work, we combine gel shift assays {{with a series of}} NMR experiments for comparative structural characterization of the wild type TM 3 / 4 hairpin and its mutants V 232 D, I 231 D, Q 207 N/V 232 E. Over 95 % of the backbone resonances of a 15 N, 13 C-labelled V 232 D-TM 3 / 4 construct in the membrane-mimetic environment of perfluorooctanoate (PFO) micelles were successfully assigned, and the presence and boundaries of helical segments within TM 3 and TM 4 were defined under these conditions. Comparative analysis of 15 N and 1 H chemical shift variations among HSQC spectra of WT-, V 232 D-, I 231 D- and Q 207 N/V 232 E-TM 3 / 4 indicated that hairpin conformations vary with the position of a <b>polar</b> <b>mutation</b> (i. e., V 232 D and I 231 D vs. WT), but remain similar when hairpins with identically-positioned polar partners are compared (i. e., V 232 D vs. Q 207 N-V 232 E).

The Ref-II mutation alone does not affect recombinant formation in F− strains, but the Ref-II, UVs strains behave in many respects like Rec− mutants, giving reduced recombination frequencies in crosses with male strains. It is suggested that the refII and uvs loci correspond to closely linked if not identical genes, concerned in some way in the activity {{of one or more}} deoxyribonucleases, and that the Ref-II, UVs mutants arise as the pleiotropic expression of a single gene or of a deletion or <b>polar</b> <b>mutation</b> affecting linked genes...|$|E

However, termination at these sites is not stringent. To determine whether termination of phi X 174 transcription depends on rho factor activity, we introduced a temperature-sensitive rho mutation (nitA) into a phi X 174 -sensitive host cell line and determined termination sites in wild-type and nitA cells. We found that (i) normal phi X 174 terminators were recognized in phi X 174 -infected nitA cells, (ii) the rho mutation relieved polar effects caused by nonsense mutations in the phage genome or by chloramphenicol {{treatment of the}} host cells, and (iii) polarity was not caused by premature termination of transcription {{at the site of}} the <b>polar</b> <b>mutation.</b> RNA synthesis continued beyond the site to the first rho-sensitive site...|$|E

Galactoside transport activities were always comparable in the two strains of bacteria; this latter result indicates that the cell envelopes of E. coli and S. typhimurium do not differ sufficiently to affect the membrane-associated lac transport system.

40|$|A {{comparison}} of the rates of synthesis of the tryptophan biosynthetic enzymes of Salmonella typhimurium under derepression showed that the genes of the trp operon can be expressed in a coordinate fashion in auxotrophs carrying nonpolar mutations. This coordination disappeared in trpA polar mutants. The loss of coordination affected only trpB, the second gene in the operon, which was always more drastically affected than the three distal genes. Polar mutations in trpA, the first gene of the trp operon, reduced the rates of synthesis of the tryptophan biosynthetic enzymes under conditions of derepression. When these rates were measured and correlated with the map position of each <b>polar</b> <b>mutation,</b> a polarity gradient of decreasing intensity (moving distally from the operator end of the gene) was obtained.

The gene responsible for suppression, era, encodes an essential GTPase of Escherichia coli.

A previously described <b>polar</b> <b>mutation,</b> rnc- 40, was also able to suppress dnaG 2903. The other mutation, era- 1, causes a single amino acid substitution (P 17 R) in the G 1 region of the GTP-binding domain of Era. Analysis of the GTPase activity of the Era- 1 mutant protein showed a four- to five-fold decrease {{in the ability to}} convert GTP to GDP.

Mutations {{were classified as}} base substitutions or frameshift {{on the basis of}} mutagen-induced reversion patterns. All guaA strains, including three frameshift mutants, produced derepressed levels of IMP dehydrogenase when cultured with a growth-limiting concentration of guanine. The guaB strains were of two types: (i) those producing derepressed levels of XMP aminase, and (ii) those producing basal levels of XMP aminase when grown under conditions of guanine starvation. In the guaB strains of the second type, the expression of the adjacent guaA gene is reduced. It is proposed that this pleiotropic effect of some guaB mutations is a result of polarity. The orientation of polarity suggests the gene order “operator”-guaB-guaA. Gel diffusion studies with IMP dehydrogenase antiserum showed that strains carrying <b>polar</b> guaB <b>mutations</b> do not produce cross-reacting material (CRM). The remaining guaB mutants were either CRM+ or CRM−. Mapping the mutations by three-factor crosses showed that polar and nonpolar guaB sites are clustered in a small genetic region cotransducible with guaA.

In this study, we have cloned an additional gene of this circuit, vanT, encoding a V. harveyi LuxR-like transcriptional regulator. A V. anguillarum ΔvanT null mutation resulted in a significant decrease in total protease activity due to loss of expression of the metalloprotease EmpA, but no changes in either AHL production or virulence. Additional genes positively regulated by VanT were identified from a plasmid-based gene library fused to a promoterless lacZ. Three lacZ fusions (serA::lacZ, hpdA-hgdA::lacZ, and sat-vps 73 ::lacZ) were identified which exhibited decreased expression in the ΔvanT strain. SerA is similar to 3 -phosphoglycerate dehydrogenases and catalyzes {{the first step in the}} serine-glycine biosynthesis pathway. HgdA has identity with homogentisate dioxygenases, and HpdA is homologous to 4 -hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenases (HPPDs) involved in pigment production. V. anguillarum strains require an active VanT to produce high levels of an l-tyrosine-induced brown color via HPPD, suggesting that VanT controls pigment production. Vps 73 and Sat are related to Vibrio cholerae proteins encoded within a DNA locus required for biofilm formation. A V. anguillarum ΔvanT mutant and a mutant carrying a <b>polar</b> <b>mutation</b> in the sat-vps 73 DNA locus were shown to produce defective biofilms.

A Tn 5 mutant with shiny colony morphology was identified with a <b>polar</b> <b>mutation</b> in BCAS 0208, predicted to encode an acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase. Mutagenesis of BCAS 0208 and complementation analyses revealed that BCAS 0208 is required for rough colony morphology, biofilm formation, and virulence on alfalfa seedlings.

BCAS 0201, encoding a putative flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) -dependent oxidoreductase, and BCAS 0207, encoding a putative citrate synthase, do not influence colony morphology but are required for optimum levels of biofilm formation and virulence. Both BCAS 0208 and BCAS 0201 contribute to pellicle formation, although individual mutations in each of these genes had no appreciable effect on pellicle formation. A mutant with a polar insertion in BCAS 0208 was significantly less virulent in a rat model of chronic lung infection {{as well as in the}} alfalfa model.

Using dynamic as well as immunofluorescence microscopy, we show that the T 3 S translocon component IpaC allows the recruitment of the Src kinase required for actin polymerization at bacterial entry sites during {{the initial stages of}} Shigella entry. Src recruitment occurred at bacterial-cell contact sites independent of actin polymerization {{at the onset of the}} invasive process and was still observed in Shigella strains mutated for translocated T 3 S effectors of invasion.

Consistent with a direct role for IpaC in Src activation, cell incubation with the IpaC last 72 carboxyterminal residues fused to the Iota toxin Ia (IaC) component that translocates into the cell cytosol upon binding to the Ib component led to Src-dependent ruffle formation. Strikingly, IaC also induced actin structures resembling bacterial entry foci that were enriched in activated Src and were inhibited by the Src inhibitor PP 2.

40|$|Mutants of Escherichia coli were {{selected}} {{in which a}} single mutational event had both relieved the polar effect of an early trpE mutation on trpB and simultaneously released the expression of trpB from tryptophan repression. The frequency at which these mutations appeared was roughly equal to the frequency of point mutations. In each of these mutants, the mutation increased the function of trpB and also increased the activity of some, but not all, of the other four tryptophan operon genes. Genetic analysis showed that the mutations were not located within the trp operon since in each case the parental trp operon could be recovered from the mutants. Each mutant was shown to carry a duplication of a trp operon segment translocated to a new position near the trp operon. Polarity is relieved since the trpB duplication-translocation {{is not in the}} same operon as the trpE <b>polar</b> <b>mutation.</b> The duplicated and translocated segments are fused to operons not regulated by tryptophan, so trpB function is no longer subject to tryptophan repression. The properties of the mutants indicate that the length of the duplicated segment and the position to which it is translocated differ in each of the seven mutants studied. The duplications are unstable, but the segregation pattern observed is not consistent with a single crossover model for segregation. That such duplication-translocation events generate a variety of new genetic arrangements at a frequency comparable with point mutations suggests they may {{play an important role in}} evolution...|$|E
40|$|The {{hemolytic}} Streptococcus pyogenes can use {{a variety}} of heme compounds as an iron source. In this study, we investigate hemoprotein utilization by S. pyogenes. We demonstrate that surface proteins contribute to the binding of hemoproteins to S. pyogenes. We identify an ABC transporter from the iron complex family named sia for streptococcal iron acquisition, which consists of a lipoprotein (siaA), membrane permease (siaB), and ATPase (siaC). The sia transporter is part of a highly conserved, iron regulated, 10 -gene operon. SiaA, which was localized to the cell membrane, could specifically bind hemoglobin. The operon's first gene encodes a novel bacterial protein that bound hemoglobin, myoglobin, heme-albumin, and hemoglobin-haptoglobin (but not apo-haptoglobin) and therefore was named Shr, for streptococcal hemoprotein receptor. PhoZ fusion and Western blot analysis showed that Shr has a leader peptide and is found in both membrane-bound and soluble forms. An M 1 SF 370 strain with a <b>polar</b> <b>mutation</b> in shr was more resistant to streptonigrin and hydrogen peroxide, suggesting decreased iron uptake. The addition of hemoglobin to the culture medium increased cell resistance to hydrogen peroxide in SF 370 but not in the mutant, implying the sia operon may be involved in hemoglobin-dependent resistance to oxidative stress. The shr mutant demonstrated reduced hemoglobin binding, though cell growth in iron-depleted medium supplemented with hemoglobin, whole blood, or ferric citrate was not affected, suggesting additional systems are involved in hemoglobin utilization. SiaA and Shr are the first hemoprotein receptors identified in S. pyogenes; their possible role in iron capture is discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{recombinant}} plasmids was generated in Escherichia coli {{in which the}} TEM beta-lactamase translocon (TnA) was inserted into the small plasmid RSF 1010. RSF 1010 is a 5. 5 X 10 (6) dalton nonconjugative plasmid which confers resistance to streptomycin and sulfonamide. The recombinant plasmids can be classified into three clearly defined phenotypic groups. Group I is ampicillin-, streptomycin- and sulfonamide-resistant. Group II is ampicillin- and sulfonamide-resistant but has lost streptomycin resistance. Group III is ampicillin-resistant but is sensitive to sulfonamide and shows a simultaneous 30 -fold reduction in the minimal inhibitory concentration of streptomycin. It was possible to map the site of insertion of TnA within RSF 1010 by electron microscope studies of DNA heteroduplexes formed between RSF 1010 and recombinant plasmids. Insertions of TnA occur at, at least, 12 distinct sites in a region corresponding to one-third of the RSF 1010 DNA molecule. Those insertions giving rise to particular phenotypes are clustered. Insertions of TnA-like insertion sequences (IS) appear to give rise to strongly <b>polar</b> <b>mutations...</b>|$|R
40|$|The tar {{locus of}} Escherichia coli {{specifies}} {{one of the}} major species of methylaccepting proteins involved in the chemotactic behavior of this organism. The physical and genetic organization of the tar region was investigated with a series of specialized A transducing phages and plasmid clones. The tar gene was mapped at the promoter-proximal end of an operon containing five other chemotaxisrelated loci. Four of those genes (cheR, cheB, che Y and cheZ) are required for all chemotactic responses; consequently, <b>polar</b> <b>mutations</b> in the tar gene resulted in a generally nonchemotactic phenotype. The fifth gene, tap, was mapped between the tar and cheR loci and specified the production of a 65 -kilodalton methylaccepting protein. Unlike the tar locus, which is required for chemotaxis to aspartate and maltose, mutants lacking only the tap function had no obvious defects in chemotactic ability. Genetic and physical maps of the tar-tap region were constructed with Mu dl (Apr lac) insertion <b>mutations,</b> whose <b>polar</b> properties conferred a phenotype suitable for deletion mapping studies. Restriction endonuclease analyses of phage and plasmid clones indicated that all of th...|$|R
40|$|The tdcB and tdcC {{genes of}} the tdcABC operon of Escherichia coli encode {{threonine}} dehydratase and a threonine-serine permease, respectively. These proteins {{are involved in}} transport and metabolism of threonine and serine during anaerobic growth. In this study, we functionally characterized tdcA, which encodes a 35 kDa polypeptide consisting of 312 amino acid residues. Non-polar and partially <b>polar</b> <b>mutations</b> introduced into tdcA drastically reduced {{the expression of the}} genes down-stream from tdcA. Complementation studies using single-copy chromosomal integrants of a tdcB-lacZ fusion harboring an in-frame deletion of tdcA with chromosomal or plasmid-borne tdcA + in trans showed complete restoration of tdc operon expression in vivo. The amino acid sequene at the amino-terminal end of TdcA revealed a significant homology to the helix-turn-helix motifs of typical DNA binding proteins. Sequence alignment of TdcA with LysR also showed considerable sequence similarity throughout their entire lengths. Our results suggest that TdcA is related to the LysR family of proteins by common ancestry and, based on its functional role in tdc expression, belongs to the LysR family of transcriptional activators. ...|$|R
