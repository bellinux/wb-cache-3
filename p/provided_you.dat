25|$|Much of Clough's {{retirement}} {{was spent}} concentrating on his fight against alcoholism, ill-health and corruption allegations. His battle with alcoholism dated {{back to the}} 1970s and was chronicled in part by Duncan Hamilton in his award-winning book <b>Provided</b> <b>You</b> Don't Kiss Me: 20 Years With Brian Clough. He considered applying for the job as manager of Wolverhampton Wanderers on the resignation of Graham Taylor in October 1995. Nothing came of it, however, and Clough's managerial career was over.|$|E

The misinterpretation of so many merits and acts of heroism carried out for Italy can only be indicative of an essentially alien and imperial government.|$|E

500|$|In 1996, Washington Post writer Bob Woodward {{reported}} that Hillary Clinton {{had been having}} [...] "imaginary discussions" [...] with Eleanor Roosevelt {{from the start of}} Clinton's time as First Lady. Following the Democrats' loss of congressional control in the 1994 elections, Clinton had engaged the services of Human Potential Movement proponent Jean Houston. Houston encouraged Clinton to pursue the Roosevelt connection, and while no psychic techniques were used with Clinton, critics and comics immediately suggested that Clinton was holding séances with Roosevelt. The White House stated that this was merely a brainstorming exercise, and a private poll later indicated that most of the public believed these were indeed just imaginary conversations, with the remainder believing that communication with the dead was actually possible. In her 2003 autobiography Living History, Clinton titled an entire chapter [...] "Conversations with Eleanor", and stated that holding [...] "imaginary conversations [...] actually a useful mental exercise to help analyze problems, <b>provided</b> <b>you</b> choose the right person to visualize. Eleanor Roosevelt was ideal." ...|$|E

Which isn't to say it's a disappointment: on the contrary, it's awesomely entertaining, <b>provided</b> <b>you</b> accept {{it on its}} own terms...Like the original film, it's a Boy's Own adventure yarn with a corny but irresistible spiritual subtext. The effects and production design are stunning, but they always serve the story, {{not the other way}} around." [...] Susan Wloszczyna of USA Today said the film did [...] "plenty right" [...] and praised the characters Darth Maul and Watto. David Cornelius of efilmcritic.com said the film's better moments [...] "don't merely balance out the weaker onesthey topple them." [...] Colin Kennedy of Empire magazine said that despite problems with pacing and writing, [...] "there is still much pleasure to be had watching our full-blown Jedi guides in action." [...] He praised the visuals and Liam Neeson's performance, and said the duel between Darth Maul and the Jedi was [...] "the saga's very best lightsaber battle".|$|E

[...] The book Level Up!: The Guide to Great Video Game Design by Scott Rogers used him as an example while discussing how the [...] "party members don't need to be human". In 2008, UGO Team stated this [...] "undisputed champion of Fallout characters" [...] is not [...] "only our favorite Fallout character, he's also one of gaming's greatest dogs." [...] That same year, Joe Martin of Bit-tech ranked Dogmeat as the sixth top PC game NPC of all time, commenting: [...] "There are a lot of computer game characters we like and a few we’d even {{go so far as to}} say we love. Dogmeat though, despite being a definite tabula rasa, sits in a different category altogether and is the only computer game character that we’d reload and repeat significant portions of a game for, just so he could stand a better chance of survival." [...] In 2009, Michael Fiegel of The Escapist called Dogmeat possibly the most beloved character of the Fallout universe, writing that [...] "in an uncaring wasteland ... Dogmeat is a moral compass: Though your needle might swing towards good or evil, his center always holds strong <b>provided</b> <b>you</b> protect him." [...] Steve and Larson of ScrewAttack ranked Dogmeat as the tenth best gaming pet in 2011. Dogmeat was included in numerous lists of best video game dogs, including by Lisa Foiles of The Escapist in 2010, Michael Perry of PlayStation Official Magazine in 2012, Gergo Vas of Kotaku in 2013, and Benjamin Abbott of Metro, Brian Taylor of Paste, and the staff of Bild in 2014. Ryan McCaffrey of IGN chose Dogmeat as the top feature he wished to return in Fallout 4.|$|E

2500|$|First {{published}} in Evergreen Review in 1964, [...] "The Killer: A Story" [...] is a first-person {{account of a}} male prisoner's parole hearing. The prisoner's thoughts consider his moral character and perspectives on life, like what qualities one needs to be viewed favorably: [...] "Good to be slim, trim, shipshape, built the way I am, <b>provided</b> <b>you</b> are modest." [...] He focuses on the negative parts of being on parole; however, he is happy {{to be out of}} prison because he has to be a repetitive drone in order to remain unnoticed.|$|E
2500|$|Horace {{spent most}} of his time in India and became {{interested}} in its birds in 1927. Ornithology at that time was not popular among Indians in India, and when Horace informed Gandhi of an expedition, Gandhi commented, [...] "That is a good hobby, <b>provided</b> <b>you</b> don't shoot them." [...] Horace demonstrated the use of binoculars as an acceptable alternative to the gun and carried them at most times. Horace Alexander joined Sidney Dillon Ripley on an expedition to the Naga hills in 1950. Ripley named a subspecies of the aberrant bush warbler after Alexander, although this is no longer recognised. In the same year he founded the Delhi Birdwatching Society along with Lt. Gen. Harold Williams. One of the early members of this organisation was the young Indira Gandhi, and the group encouraged Indian ornithologists such as Usha Ganguli. Many of his notes were mislaid when one of his suitcases was lost in India in 1946. Through his influence on Jawaharlal Nehru he was instrumental in the designation of the Sultanpur Bird Sanctuary near Delhi.|$|E

Greg Miller, writing for IGN, listed Madison {{as one of the}} characters he'd [...] "fallen for", praising her realism and the emotions behind her sex scene with Ethan.

2500|$|With Frears as director, {{principal}} photography {{was scheduled}} {{for the end of}} 2007. He pulled out of the film in November, stating that he could not work out the logistics of the film and that he had [...] "set out in pursuit of something that was leading him down a blind alley". Tom Hooper, who directed Morgan's Longford, replaced him. Hooper researched Clough by reading Duncan Hamilton's <b>Provided</b> <b>You</b> Don't Kiss Me, an award-winning biography of Clough. He also planned to meet with Clough's family and with some of the Leeds players during Clough's tenure. Casting continued through to May 2008. In April, Colm Meaney, Timothy Spall and Jim Broadbent were announced as Don Revie, Peter Taylor and Sam Longson respectively. During pre-production, Langan had viewed archive footage of Clough and Revie and considered whether Revie should be played by an actor much older than Sheen; despite being 47 in the footage, Revie [...] "could pass for 60". Before Meaney was cast, the younger Kenneth Branagh had been considered. Non-league Garforth Town A.F.C. held auditions for non-speaking football players on 14 May. Auditionees were expected to have played in the Northern Counties East League, Northern Premier League, or higher. Casting for extras took place on 20 and 21 May.|$|E
