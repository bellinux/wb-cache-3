40|$|We have {{obtained}} additional {{evidence for the}} Early Carboniferous paleomagnetic field for cratonic North America from study of the Barnett Formation of central Texas. A characteristic magnetization of this unit was isolated after thermal demagnetization at four sites (36 samples) out of eight sites (65 samples) collected. The mean direction of declination = 156. 3 °, inclination = 5. 8 ° (N = 4,k = 905, α 95 = 3. 0 °), corresponds to a paleomagnetic pole <b>position</b> at <b>lat.</b> = 49. 1 °N,long. = 119. 3 °E (dp = 1. 5 °, dm = 3. 0 °).

Comparison of the Barnett pole with other Early Carboniferous (Mississippian) paleopoles from North America shows that it lies close to the apparent polar wander path for stable North America and that the divergence of paleopoles from the Northern Appalachians noted previously for the Devonian persisted into the Early Carboniferous. We interpret this difference in paleopoles as further evidence for the Northern Appalachian displaced terrain which we refer to here as Acadia, and the apparent coherence of Late Carboniferous paleopoles as indicating a large (∼ 1500 km) motion of Acadia with respect to stable North America over a rather short time interval in the Carboniferou...|$|R

40|$|Launched on the 11 th of June 2008, the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) {{has made}} several {{outstanding}} scientific {{contributions to the}} high energy astrophysics community. One of these contributions was the high statistics measurement of the Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) electron + positron spectrum from 20 GeV to 1 TeV. The Fermi satellite is in a nearly circular orbit with an inclination of 25. 6 degrees {{at an altitude of}} 565 km. Given this orbit it is possible to measure the GCR electrons + positrons down to roughly 5 GeV. However, this lower limit in energy is highly dependent on the orbital <b>position</b> of the <b>LAT</b> in geomagnetic coordinates due to the rigidity cutoff. In order to measure the spectrum down to these energies it is necessary to sample the population of electrons + positrons in several different geomagnetic positions.

40|$|The paleomagnetism of two {{sedimentary}} rock units from the foreland of the Mauritanides of West Africa, in the Taganet region of Mauritania (Taoudeni basin) was studied to provide {{constraints on the}} paleocontinental positions of the southern continents in the Paleozoic. Thermal demagnetization of samples from the lower to middle Devonian Gneiguira supergroup isolated a predominantly single polarity characteristic magnetization (D = 135. 7 °, I = 27. 3 °, alpha 95 = 5. 3 ° for N = 10 sites/ 44 samples) which gives a south paleopole <b>position</b> at <b>Lat</b> = 35. 2 °S, Long = 43. 6 °E (dp, dm = 3. 0 °, 5. 6 °). The only other direction sometimes present is one aligned near to the present dipole field axis, notably as a high temperature component of reversed polarity in 7 samples (D = 177. 9 °, I = − 26. 9 °) obtained from 2 sites in weathered outcrop. The Upper Proterozoic to Cambrian (?) Mejeria red sandstone unit, equivalent to the Adrar CO 10, although apparently unweathered has multicomponent magnetization. Most common is an intermediate temperature (300 ° to 550 °C) direction (D = 137. 2 °, 1 = 14. 4 °, alpha 95 = 13. 2 ° for N = 4 sites/ 17 samples) similar to the characteristic direction of the Gneiguira. A high temperature component can be isolated in 11 samples but the directions are randomly distributed. Comparison of the Gneiguira paleopole with other middle to late Paleozoic poles from Africa and Australia suggests that either it represents a Carboniferous remagnetization or that the south paleomagnetic pole for Gondwana already was off southern Africa by the Devonian. The paleogeographic and tectonic consequences of these possibilities differ considerably for the Atlantic bordering continents...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The LAT Instrument Science Operations Center (ISOC) {{will perform}} various tasks to support {{coordination}} of multiwavelength observations for transient sources. In this paper, {{we describe the}} prototype implementation of the Automated Science Processing (ASP) for the detection and analysis of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in LAT and GBM data. The GRB-related tasks include: <b>position</b> refinement using <b>LAT</b> data given initial GBM or GCN locations, spectral analysis using LAT data alone, joint spectral fitting with GBM data, gamma-ray afterglow detection and characterization, and blind searches for prompt burst emission in LAT data.

Radiographic detection of fluid in the tympanic bulla is only moderately sensitive in the dog and cat. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the accuracy of radiographic detection of fluid in the rabbit tympanic bulla for three different radiographic projections. Forty rabbit cadavers were used. Half of the tympanic bullae were randomly allocated to be filled with soft tissue material. Following this procedure, each specimen was radiographed in three projections: dorsoventral (DV), rostro 40 degrees ventral-caudodorsal (R 40 degrees V-CdDO), and left and right latero 40 degrees ventral-laterodorsal (Lat 40 degrees V-LatDO). After imaging, each specimen was frozen and sectioned to determine the content of the tympanic bullae. Images were interpreted and scored independently by two board-certified radiologists. There was no significant difference in sensitivity or specificity between the three projections when compared with the gross findings following sectioning, but observer confidence was highest for the DV projection. Accuracy of radiographic fluid detection was similar to that reported in the dog and cat. The DV and R 40 degrees V-CdDO allow comparison of both tympanic bullae on a single radiograph, but the DV was subjectively easier to <b>position,</b> while the <b>Lat</b> 40 degrees V-LatDO requires two radiographs for compariso...|$|R

We constructed a phase-coherent ephemeris, with post-fit residual rms of 3 μs, using radio data spanning ~ 23. 2 yr, enabling measurements of the multi-wavelength light-curve properties of PSR B 1821 − 24 at the milliperiod level. We fold RXTE observations of PSR B 1821 − 24 from 1996 to 2007 and discuss implications on the emission zones. The gamma-ray light curve consists of two peaks separated by 0. 41 ± 0. 02 in phase, with the first gamma-ray peak lagging behind the first radio peak by 0. 05 ± 0. 02 in phase, consistent with the phase of giant radio pulses. We observe significant emission in the off-peak interval of PSR B 1821 − 24 with a best-fit <b>LAT</b> <b>position</b> inconsistent with the core of M 28. We do not detect significant gamma-ray pulsations at the spin or orbital periods from any other known pulsar in M 28, and we place limits {{on the number of}} energetic pulsars in the cluster.

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} all the archival X-ray data of 134 unidentified (unID) gammaray sources {{listed in}} the first Fermi/LAT (1 FGL) catalog and subsequently followed up by Swift/XRT. We constructed the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from radio to gamma-rays for each X-ray source detected, and tried to pick up unique objects that display anomalous spectral signatures. In these analysis, we target all the 1 FGL unID sources, using updated data from the second Fermi/LAT (2 FGL) catalog on their <b>LAT</b> <b>position</b> and spectra. We found several potentially interesting objects, particularly three sources, 1 FGL J 0022. 2 - 1850, 1 FGL J 0038. 0 + 1236 and 1 FGL J 0157. 0 - 5259, which were then more deeply observed with Suzaku {{as a part of}} an AO 7 program in 2012. We successfully detected an X-ray counterpart for each source whose X-ray spectra were well fitted by a single power-law function. The positional coincidence with a bright radio counterpart (currently identified as AGN) in the 2 FGL error circles suggests these are definitely the X-ray emission from the same AGN, but their SEDs show a wide variety of behavior. In particular, the SED of 1 FGL J 0038. 0 + 1236 is difficult to be explained by conventional emission models of blazars. The source 1 FGL J 0022. 2 - 1850 may be in a transition state between a low-frequency peaked BL Lac and a high-frequency peaked BL Lac object, and 1 FGL J 0157. 0 - 5259 could be a rare kind of extreme blazar. We discuss the possible nature of these three sources observed with Suzaku, together with the X-ray identification results and SEDs of all 134 sources observed with Swift/XRT.

40|$|This study {{provides}} reliable, precisely defined and well-dated Early Permian (286 ± 6 Ma) palaeomagnetic poles for Australia from the Mount Leyshon Intrusive Complex (MLIC) and the Tuckers Igneous Complex (TIC). Both complexes {{are associated with}} prominent negative magnetic anomalies, indicating the presence of rocks carrying stable remanence of reverse polarity, with a Koenigsberger ratio greater than unity. The characteristic remanence carried by the intrusive phases and by locally remagnetized, contact-metamorphosed host rocks is always of reverse polarity, consistent with acquisition during the Permo-Carboniferous (Kiaman) Reverse Superchron. The corresponding palaeopoles confirm that Australia occupied high latitudes in the Early Permian. The pole <b>positions</b> are: MLIC: <b>lat.</b> = 43. 2 °S, long. = 137. 3 °E; dp= 6. 0 °, dm= 6. 4 °; Q = 6; TIC: lat. = 47. 5 °S, long. = 143. 0 °E, dp= 6. 0 °, dm= 6. 6 °; Q = 6. Permian palaeomagnetic overprinting is detectable at considerable distances from the MLIC (2 – 3 km), well beyond the zone of visible alteration. The primary nature of the Early Permian palaeomagnetic signature is established by full baked contact/aureole tests at both localities. Other newdata from Australia {{are consistent with the}} poles reported here. Comparison of the Australian, African and South American Apparent Polar Wander Paths (APWP) suggests that mean Permian and Triassic poles fromWest Gondwana, particularly from South America, are biased by remagnetization in the Jurassic–Cretaceous and that the Late Palaeozoic–Mesozoic APWP for Gondwana is best defined by Australian data. The Australian APWP exhibits substantial movement through the Mesozoic. Provided only that the time-averaged palaeofield was zonal, the Early Triassic palaeomagnetic data from Australia provide an important palaeogeographic constraint that the south geographic pole was within, or very close to, SE Australia around 240 Ma. The new Early Permian poles are apparently more consistent with Pangaea B-type reconstructions of Gondwana and Laurussia than with the Pangaea A 2 configuration. This may be partly an artefact of reconstruction problems within Gondwana, as systematic differences between approximately coeval, apparently reliable, Permo-Carboniferous poles from Africa, South America and Australia are evident in standard Gondwana reconstructions. These discordances require a tighter fit of the southern continents, suggesting that some attenuation of continental margins, not accounted for in the reconstructions, has occurred during breakup of Gondwana, or that the fit between East and West Gondwana needs to be substantially modified. If stretching of continental margins during breakup of supercontinents is a general phenomenon, it may help to ameliorate, but not solve, the long-standing controversy regarding Pangaea reconstructions. Although alternative Pangaea reconstructions, such as Pangaea B, may reconcile poles from Laurussia with Australian poles in the Late Carboniferous–Early Permian, no plausible reconstruction can bring the Early Triassic poles into agreement. This suggests that persistent departures from a pure dipole field may have been present in the Early Triassic. Lesser, but still significant, non-dipole effects may also have been present during the Late Carboniferous and Permian, and may help resolve the Pangaea A versus B controversy, without requiring substantial attenuation of continental margins or intracontinental deformation. We suggest that the most parsimonious interpretation of the palaeomagnetic and geological information is that Laurussia and Gondwana remained in a Pangaea A 2 -type configuration through the Permian and Triassic. Discordance between the APWPs for these two supercontinents is attributable mainly to persistent non-dipole components of the geomagnetic field, which were most important in the Early Triassic. 25 page(s...|$|R
