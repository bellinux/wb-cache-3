40|$|A simple {{technique}} is described for making niobium based superconductive tunnel junctions using, {{instead of a}} deposited niobium film, the <b>polished</b> <b>end</b> of a niobium wire. By use of ion bombardment after mechanical polishing volt-ampere characteristics of reproducible shape are produced. Junction quality, as determined by excess current for low voltage, approaches that of junctions made with sputtered Nb films. Josephson junctions made with this technique have large critical currents although the magnetic field dependence of these currents suggest somewhat nonuniform tunneling barriers...|$|R

40|$|Planar {{waveguide}} {{structures in}} chalcogenide glass were fabricated with 17 MeV or 150 MeV swift Kr ion irradiation. Images of the <b>polished</b> <b>end</b> {{faces of the}} Kr-irradiated chalcogenide glass were measured with a metallographic microscope using reflected polarized light. SRIM 2010 was used to simulate the electronic and nuclear stopping powers for swift Kr ion irradiation. The micro-Raman spectra were measured in air. The near-field intensity distributions were investigated at visible (633 nm) and near-infrared (1300 nm, 1500 nm, 1539 nm and 1620 nm) bands. These intensity distributions make the waveguide candidates for infrared laser devices. The estimated propagation loss of the waveguide fabricated by 150 MeV swift Kr ion irradiation was approximately 4 dB/cm at a wavelength of 633 nm. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|In early examples, the rod's ends {{had to be}} {{polished}} {{with great}} precision, such that {{the ends of the}} rod were flat to within a quarter of a wavelength of the output light, and parallel to each other within a few seconds of arc. The finely <b>polished</b> <b>ends</b> of the rod were silvered; one end completely, the other only partially. The rod, with its reflective ends, then acts as a Fabry-Pérot etalon (or a Gires-Tournois etalon). Modern lasers often use rods with antireflection coatings, or with the <b>ends</b> cut and <b>polished</b> at Brewster's angle instead. This eliminates the reflections from the ends of the rod. External dielectric mirrors then are used to form the optical cavity. Curved mirrors are typically used to relax the alignment tolerances and to form a stable resonator, often compensating for thermal lensing of the rod.|$|R

40|$|All-fiber multireflector {{spectral}} filters {{which have}} potential application in optical communications {{have been investigated}} experimentally. These multireflector etalons were produced by aligning equal-length fiber sections with TiO 2 /SiO 2 dielectric mirrors deposited on the end in a silicon v-groove. Fiber sections 1. 33 mm in length were produced by polishing, with the fibers held in a silicon wafer polishing jig. The fibers were aligned inside the polishing jig using a precision micro positioner. Then four polishing steps with increasingly finer grit were applied to produce high-quality <b>polished</b> <b>end</b> surfaces on each fiber section. Finally, a dielectric mirror was deposited {{on one end of}} each fiber section by magnetron sputtering. After characterizing the optical loss, length, and mirror reflectance for each of the fiber sections, sections which were well-matched in length were chosen for assembly of the four-mirror etalon, which had nominal reflectance values of 10 %, 50 %, 50 %, and 10 % for the dielectric mirrors. Measured transmittance spectra for a mutireflector spectral filter were compared with calculated spectra. Thermal tuning of the multireflector etalon was also investigated. A 0. 34 nm wavelength shift was observed for a 23 ?
