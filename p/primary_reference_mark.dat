5000|$|Geodetic survey markers {{were often}} set in groups. For example, in {{triangulation}} surveys, the primary point identified {{was called the}} triangulation station, or the [...] "main station". It was often marked by a [...] "station disk" [...] (see upper photo at left), a brass disk with a triangle inscribed on its surface and an impressed mark that indicated the precise point over which a surveyor's plumb-bob should be dropped to assure a precise location over it. A triangulation station was often surrounded by several (usually three) <b>reference</b> <b>marks</b> (see second photo at left), each of which bore an arrow that pointed back towards the main station. These <b>reference</b> <b>marks</b> {{made it easier for}} later visitors to [...] "recover" [...] (or re-find) the <b>primary</b> ("station") <b>mark.</b> <b>Reference</b> <b>marks</b> also made it possible to replace (or reset) a station mark that had been disturbed or destroyed.|$|R
50|$|Traversing is {{a common}} method of {{surveying}} smaller areas. The surveyor starts from an old <b>reference</b> <b>mark</b> or known position and places a network of <b>reference</b> <b>marks</b> covering the survey area. They then measure bearings and distances between the <b>reference</b> <b>marks,</b> and to the target features. Most traverses form a loop pattern or link between two prior <b>reference</b> <b>marks</b> so the surveyor can check their measurements.|$|R
50|$|Distance coded <b>reference</b> <b>marks</b> (DCRM) {{are placed}} onto the scale {{in a unique}} pattern {{allowing}} a minimal movement (typically moving past two <b>reference</b> <b>marks)</b> to define the readhead's position. Multiple, equally spaced <b>reference</b> <b>marks</b> may also be placed onto the scale such that following installation, the desired marker can either be selected - usually via a magnet or optically or unwanted ones deselected using labels or by being painted over.|$|R

40|$|A {{method to}} obtain the {{absolute}} measure of the position is {{by means of the}} autocorrelation of two zero <b>reference</b> <b>marks.</b> In one-axis measurement systems one dimensional mark are used and the design of these marks is relatively complex. When the movement is in two-axes, two dimensional <b>reference</b> <b>marks</b> are required and they are even harder to design. We report a method of global optimization to calculate the optimal two dimensional zero <b>reference</b> <b>marks</b> which generate the reference signal with the highest central peak. This method proves to be a powerful tool for solving this problem...|$|R
50|$|Most incremental, linear {{encoders}} {{can produce}} an index or <b>reference</b> <b>mark</b> pulse providing a datum position along the scale for use at power-up or following {{a loss of}} power. This index signal {{must be able to}} identify position within one, unique period of the scale. The <b>reference</b> <b>mark</b> may comprise a single feature on the scale, an autocorrelator pattern (typically a Barker code) or a chirp pattern.|$|R
40|$|A <b>Primary</b> <b>Reference</b> Preparation {{has been}} {{produced}} using pure, recombinant, Cystatin C in a solvent of 0. 1 mol/L KCl. Dry mass {{determination of the}} <b>Primary</b> <b>Reference</b> Preparation resulted in a Cystatin C concentration of 5. 20 g/L. Agarose-electrophoresis and SDS-electrophoresis, as well as N-terminal sequencing, verified the purity, homogeneity and identity of Cystatin C in the <b>Primary</b> <b>Reference</b> Preparation. For the Secondary Reference Preparation, a serum pool was collected and stabilized. A pilot batch was made to verify the selected procedure and spiking with the pure, recombinant Cystatin C. The final Secondary Reference Preparation is now produced (4468 vials) and ready for value assignment and further characterization...|$|R

5000|$|In the U.S., {{a survey}} disk is usually {{engraved}} {{with the name}} of the agency that placed it. The name of the mark (or the [...] "station" [...] it locates) is usually stamped into its surface, along with the date on which it was set (or re-set, since markers that have been destroyed can be replaced). Disks marked with a triangle are known as [...] "triangulation station disks," [...] since they mark the position of the primary point used for triangulation (or map-making). Disks marked with an arrow are called <b>reference</b> <b>marks</b> (RMs), since they point (or [...] "refer") to the principal station that may be located many feet away. A triangulation station often had two or three <b>reference</b> <b>marks.</b> <b>Reference</b> <b>marks</b> were set to enable the primary station to be re-established (or re-set) if needed.|$|R

The temporal <b>reference</b> <b>marking</b> systems in Dutch and Sign Language of the Netherlands (SLN) differ substantially, with Dutch having {{a wide range of}} lexical and morphological markers of temporal reference, and SLN relying on lexical <b>marking</b> of temporal <b>reference.</b> The results showed that the youngest proficient signers had difficulties with tense morphology: they avoided the marked past tense form in narratives and omitted verbs, but showed no problems with lexical <b>marking</b> of temporal <b>reference.</b> In the older proficient signing writers, verb morphology emerged, and in proficient signing adults temporal <b>reference</b> <b>marking</b> resembled that of the hearing adults. This study shows that in order to gain more insight into deaf people's writing, it is important to adopt a bilingual perspective and take variations in sign language proficiency into account...|$|R
