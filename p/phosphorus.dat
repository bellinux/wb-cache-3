5|$|In the {{semiconductor}} industry, POCl3 {{is used as}} a safe liquid <b>phosphorus</b> source in diffusion processes. The <b>phosphorus</b> acts as a dopant used to create n-type layers on a silicon wafer.|$|E
5|$|<b>Phosphorus</b> {{could be}} {{intentionally}} introduced into diamond grown by {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) at concentrations up to ~0.01%. <b>Phosphorus</b> substitutes carbon in the diamond lattice. Similar to nitrogen, <b>phosphorus</b> has one more electron than carbon and thus acts as a donor; however, the ionization energy of <b>phosphorus</b> (0.6 eV) is much smaller than that of nitrogen (1.7 eV) and is small enough for room-temperature thermal ionization. This important property of <b>phosphorus</b> in diamond favors electronic applications, such as UV light emitting diodes (LEDs, at 235nm).|$|E
5|$|Phosphoryl {{chloride}} (commonly called <b>phosphorus</b> oxychloride) is a {{colourless liquid}} with the formula 3. It hydrolyses in moist air releasing phosphoric acid and choking fumes of hydrogen chloride. It is manufactured industrially {{on a large}} scale from <b>phosphorus</b> trichloride and oxygen or <b>phosphorus</b> pentoxide. It is mainly used to make phosphate esters such as tricresyl phosphate.|$|E
5|$|According to NJDEP reports, two {{developed}} lake {{communities in}} the Papakating Creek watershed—Lake Neepaulin and the nearby Clove Acres Lake contribute to <b>phosphorus</b> loading {{in the waters of}} Papakating Creek. The <b>phosphorus</b> loading may originate from the runoff of fertilizer applications on residential lawns, nearby agricultural operations, or from large populations of geese that inhabit the lakes.|$|E
5|$|According to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), two {{developed}} lake {{communities in}} the Papakating Creek watershed—Lake Neepaulin and the nearby Clove Acres Lake contribute to <b>phosphorus</b> loading {{in the waters of}} Papakating Creek. The <b>phosphorus</b> loading may originate from the runoff of fertilizer applications on residential lawns, nearby agricultural operations, or from large populations of geese that inhabit the lakes.|$|E
5|$|Each year, some East African {{populations of}} blue {{wildebeest}} have a long-distance migration, seemingly timed {{to coincide with}} the annual pattern of rainfall and grass growth. The timing of their migrations in both the rainy and dry seasons can vary considerably (by months) from year to year. At the end of the wet season (May or June in East Africa), wildebeest migrate to dry-season areas in response to a lack of surface (drinking) water. When the rainy season begins again (months later), animals quickly move back to their wet-season ranges. Factors suspected to affect migration include food abundance, surface water availability, predators, and <b>phosphorus</b> content in grasses. <b>Phosphorus</b> is a crucial element for all life forms, particularly for lactating female bovids. As a result, during the rainy season, wildebeest select grazing areas that contain particularly high <b>phosphorus</b> levels. One study found, in addition to <b>phosphorus,</b> wildebeest select ranges containing grass with relatively high nitrogen content.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Albright and Wilson built a {{chemical}} {{works on the}} opposite side of the dock from the power stations. The chemical works produced white <b>phosphorus</b> from phosphate rock imported, through the docks, into the UK. Phosphate rock was stored in concrete silos on the dockside until it was required. Electricity provided by the local power stations was used to run six 7.5megawatt electric arc furnaces (45MW total) that reduced the phosphate rock. The <b>phosphorus</b> was then moved in sealed railway tanks to Oldbury and to Kirkby. After the closure of the factory the decontamination included the removal of yellow (spontaneously combustible) and red allotropes of <b>phosphorus.</b> The site is now home to Portishead volunteer coastguard.|$|E
5|$|<b>Phosphorus</b> was {{prepared}} from urine, by Hennig Brand, in 1669. It {{was the first}} element to be chemically discovered.|$|E
5|$|The {{journalist}} Delia Logan {{who attended}} a séance with Home in London claimed that Home had used a <b>phosphorus</b> trick. During the séance luminous hands were observed and the host told Logan that had seen Home place a small bottle upon the mantle piece. The host slipped the bottle {{into his pocket and}} when examined the next day, it was found to contain <b>phosphorus</b> oil.|$|E
5|$|Attention {{to water}} quality was focused in South Florida in 1986 when a {{widespread}} algal bloom occurred in one-fifth of Lake Okeechobee. The bloom was discovered {{to be the}} result of fertilizers from the Everglades Agricultural Area. Although laws stated in 1979 that the chemicals used in the EAA should not be deposited into the lake, they were flushed into the canals that fed the Everglades Water Conservation Areas, and eventually pumped into the lake. Microbiologists discovered that, although <b>phosphorus</b> assists plant growth, it destroys periphyton, one of the basic building blocks of marl in the Everglades. Marl is one of two types of Everglades soil, along with peat; it is found where parts of the Everglades are flooded for shorter periods of time as layers of periphyton dry. Most of the <b>phosphorus</b> compounds also rid peat of dissolved oxygen and promote algae growth, causing native invertebrates to die, and sawgrass to be replaced with invasive cattails that grow too tall and thick for birds and alligators to nest in. Tested water showed 500parts per billion (ppb) of <b>phosphorus</b> near sugarcane fields. State legislation in 1987 mandated a 40% reduction of <b>phosphorus</b> by 1992.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria of {{the genus}} Azotobacter are also known to form {{intracellular}} inclusions of polyhydroxyalkanoates under certain environmental conditions (e.g. lack of elements such as <b>phosphorus,</b> nitrogen, or oxygen combined with an excessive supply of carbon sources).|$|E
5|$|Beef is an {{excellent}} source of zinc, selenium, <b>phosphorus,</b> iron, and B vitamins. Bison meat is lower in fat and cholesterol than beef, but has a higher protein content.|$|E
5|$|Bone meal is an {{important}} fertilizer rich in calcium, <b>phosphorus,</b> and nitrogen, effective in removing soil acidity. Bovid horns {{have been used as}} drinking vessels since antiquity.|$|E
5|$|Carbon, aluminium, <b>phosphorus</b> and {{selenium}} {{continue the}} theme. Carbon, in black powder, is a constituent of fireworks rocket propellants, bursting charges, and effects mixtures, and military delay fuses and igniters. Aluminium {{is a common}} pyrotechnic ingredient, and is widely employed for its capacity to generate light and heat, including in thermite mixtures. <b>Phosphorus</b> {{can be found in}} smoke and incendiary munitions, paper caps used in toy guns, and party poppers. Selenium has been used {{in the same way as}} tellurium.|$|E
5|$|Five metalloids—boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic and antimony—can {{be found}} in cell phones (along with at least 39 other metals and nonmetals). Tellurium is {{expected}} to find such use. Of the less often recognised metalloids, <b>phosphorus,</b> gallium (in particular) and selenium have semiconductor applications. <b>Phosphorus</b> is used in trace amounts as a dopant for n-type semiconductors. The commercial use of gallium compounds is dominated by semiconductor applications—in integrated circuits; cell phones; laser diodes; light-emitting diodes; photodetectors; and solar cells. Selenium {{is used in the}} production of solar cells and in high-energy surge protectors.|$|E
5|$|Further {{problems}} with the environment arose when a vast algal bloom appeared in one-fifth of Lake Okeechobee in 1986, the same year cattails were discovered overtaking sawgrass marshes in Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge. Scientists discovered that <b>phosphorus,</b> used as a fertilizer in the EAA, was flushed into canals and pumped back into the lake. When the lake drained, the <b>phosphorus</b> entered {{the water in the}} marshes, changing the nutrient levels. It kept periphyton from forming marl, one of two soils in the Everglades. The arrival of <b>phosphorus</b> allowed cattails to spread quickly. The cattails grew in dense mats—too thick for birds or alligators to nest in. It also dissolved oxygen in the peat, promoted algae, and prohibited growth of native invertebrates {{on the bottom of the}} food chain.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, one John Holland of Cincinnati {{discovered}} {{the ability to}} melt and make castings of iridium by fusing the white-hot ore with <b>phosphorus,</b> and patented the process in the United States. He invoked the help of Dudley in {{getting rid of the}} <b>phosphorus,</b> who did so by repeated applications of lime at great heat. This was the first reported method of refining iridium. Dudley then found new applications for iridium, and formed the American Iridium Company with Holland. Dudley filed a patent on his method for iridium electroplating in 1887.|$|E
5|$|In Bertrand's {{persistent}} carbenes, the unsaturated carbon is {{bonded to}} a <b>phosphorus</b> and a silicon. However, these compounds seem to exhibit some alkynic properties, and when published the exact carbenic {{nature of these}} red oils was in debate.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, {{some of the}} elements adjacent to the commonly recognised metalloids, although usually classified as either metals or nonmetals, are occasionally referred to as near-metalloids or noted for their metalloidal character. To {{the left of the}} metal–nonmetal dividing line, such elements include gallium, tin and bismuth. They show unusual packing structures, marked covalent chemistry (molecular or polymeric), and amphoterism. To the right of the dividing line are carbon, <b>phosphorus,</b> selenium and iodine. They exhibit metallic lustre, semiconducting properties and bonding or valence bands with delocalized character. This applies to their most thermodynamically stable forms under ambient conditions: carbon as graphite; <b>phosphorus</b> as black phosphorus; and selenium as grey selenium.|$|E
5|$|It is {{experimentally}} {{demonstrated that}} hydrogen passivates electrically active boron and <b>phosphorus</b> impurities. As {{a result of}} such passivation, shallow donor centers are presumably produced.|$|E
5|$|Phosphate. PTH is {{the major}} {{regulator}} of serum phosphate concentrations via actions on the kidney. It is an inhibitor of proximal tubular reabsorption of <b>phosphorus.</b> Through activation of vitamin D the absorption (intestinal) of Phosphate is increased.|$|E
5|$|<b>Phosphorus,</b> {{selenium}} and lead, {{which are}} less often recognised as metalloids, {{are also used}} in glasses. Phosphate glass has a substrate of <b>phosphorus</b> pentoxide (P2O5), rather than the silica (SiO2) of conventional silicate glasses. It is used, for example, to make sodium lamps. Selenium compounds can be used both as decolourising agents and to add a red colour to glass. Decorative glassware made of traditional lead glass contains at least 30% lead(II) oxide (PbO); lead glass used for radiation shielding may have up to 65% PbO. Lead-based glasses have also been extensively used in electronics components; enamelling; sealing and glazing materials; and solar cells. Bismuth based oxide glasses have emerged as a less toxic replacement for lead {{in many of these}} applications.|$|E
5|$|Samarium {{carbides}} {{are prepared}} by melting a graphite-metal mixture in an inert atmosphere. After the synthesis, they are unstable in air and are studied also under inert atmosphere. Samarium monophosphide SmP is a semiconductor with the bandgap of 1.10eV, {{the same as}} in silicon, and high electrical conductivity of n-type. It can be prepared by annealing at 1100°C an evacuated quartz ampoule containing mixed powders of <b>phosphorus</b> and samarium. <b>Phosphorus</b> is highly volatile at high temperatures and may explode, thus the heating rate has to be kept well below 1°C/min. Similar procedure is adopted for the monarsenide SmAs, but the synthesis temperature is higher at 1800°C.|$|E
5|$|Silicon carbide is a semiconductor, {{which can}} be doped n-type by {{nitrogen}} or <b>phosphorus</b> and p-type by beryllium, boron, aluminium, or gallium. Metallic conductivity has been achieved by heavy doping with boron, aluminium or nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|The Everglades Forever Act, {{introduced}} by Governor Lawton Chiles in 1994, {{was an attempt}} to legislate the lowering of <b>phosphorus</b> in Everglades waterways. The act put the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) in charge of testing and enforcing low <b>phosphorus</b> levels: 10parts per billion (ppb) (down from 500ppb in the 1980s). The SFWMD built Stormwater Treatment Areas (STAs) near sugarcane fields where water leaving the EAA flows into ponds lined with lime rock and layers of peat and calcareous periphyton. Testing has shown this method to be more effective than previously anticipated, bringing levels from 80ppb to 10ppb.|$|E
5|$|The {{concentration}} of nitrogen in Roaring Creek ranges from 956.5 micrograms per liter at site 1 to 2343.1 micrograms per liter at site 2. The <b>phosphorus</b> concentration ranges from 12.6 micrograms per liter at site 1 to 28.6 micrograms per liter at site 2.|$|E
5|$|The known {{chalcogenides}} of americium {{include the}} sulfide AmS2, selenides AmSe2 and Am3Se4, and tellurides Am2Te3 and AmTe2. The pnictides of americium (243Am) of the AmX type {{are known for}} the elements <b>phosphorus,</b> arsenic, antimony and bismuth. They crystallize in the rock-salt lattice.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the samples collected by the Apollo 15 astronauts from the Apennine Front are, other than KREEP (potassium, rare-earth elements, <b>phosphorus)</b> materials, included anorthosite, and recrystallized norite and breccia.|$|E
5|$|The {{waters of}} Buffalo Creek are {{slightly}} acidic, with a pH ranging between 5.0 and 6.7. Metals such as magnesium {{have been observed}} in the waters. Nonmetals in the water include dissolved oxygen, calcium carbonate, suspended solids, and <b>phosphorus.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{high levels}} of <b>phosphorus</b> and mercury were {{discovered}} in the waterways in 1986, water quality became a focus for water management agencies. Costly and lengthy court battles were waged between various government entities to determine {{who was responsible for}} monitoring and enforcing water quality standards. Governor Lawton Chiles proposed a bill that determined which agencies would have that responsibility, and set deadlines for pollutant levels to decrease in water. Initially the bill was criticized by conservation groups for not being strict enough on polluters, but the Everglades Forever Act was passed in 1994. Since then, the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have surpassed expectations for achieving lower <b>phosphorus</b> levels.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{not widely}} cultivated, Alloxylon flammeum {{has proven to be}} by far the most hardy and {{adaptable}} (as well as the showiest) member of the genus Alloxylon, and has been grown successfully in as cool a climate as Victoria. It does best in a well-drained soil rich in organic material but low in <b>phosphorus</b> with some shelter when young. Applying mulch to the soil around the plant and extra water in dry spells is beneficial. Fertilisers high in <b>phosphorus</b> content can damage the plant, though fertilisers specifically for Australian native plants can be used. Yellowing of new leaves may indicate chlorosis from iron deficiency and can be remedied with iron chelate or iron sulphate. Its flowers attract birds to gardens. A large tree grows in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney. It is thought that there are more plants in cultivation than there are in the wild.|$|E
5|$|At a {{fundamental}} level, energy flow and biogeochemical cycling set an upper {{limit on the}} number and mass of organisms in any ecosystem. Human impacts on the Earth are demonstrated {{in a general way}} through detrimental changes in the global biogeochemical cycles of chemicals that are critical to life, most notably those of water, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen and <b>phosphorus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Commercially {{available}} iron {{is classified}} based on purity and {{the abundance of}} additives. Pig iron has 3.5–4.5% carbon and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as sulfur, silicon and <b>phosphorus.</b> Pig iron is not a saleable product, but rather an intermediate step {{in the production of}} cast iron and steel. The reduction of contaminants in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and <b>phosphorus,</b> yields cast iron containing 2–4% carbon, 1–6% silicon, and small amounts of manganese. Pig iron has a melting point in the range of 1420–1470K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly and depend on the form the carbon takes in the alloy.|$|E
5|$|H. aurantiaca secretes {{large amounts}} of oxalic acid, a {{reducing}} agent and relatively strong acid. This stimulates weathering of the humus layer of forest soil, and influences the solubility and turnover of nutrients (particularly <b>phosphorus</b> and nitrogen), which in turn affects their availability for use by forest trees.|$|E
5|$|In {{parts of}} its range, {{such as the}} Harboi, these steppe {{ecosystems}} are employed as rangeland for grazing animals such as sheep and goats, although this forage is generally of poor nutritional quality. P.atriplicifolia can serve as {{an important source of}} <b>phosphorus</b> and zinc, despite being high in poorly-digested material such as neutral detergent fiber and lignin.|$|E
5|$|Most Proteaceae and all Banksia species, {{including}} B.aemula, have proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters of}} short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These roots are particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. A study of six wallum species, including B.aemula, found they have adapted to very low levels of <b>phosphorus</b> and are highly sensitive to increased levels of the element, leading to <b>phosphorus</b> toxicity. Some evidence suggests they are efficient at using potassium, and sensitive to calcium toxicity as well. A field study on North Stradbroke Island noted increased root growth in autumn (around April), but that overall root growth was more constant than other species looked at, possibly because its deeper roots had more regular access to groundwater.|$|E
