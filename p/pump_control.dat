5000|$|Ultrasonic level sensors {{are used}} for {{non-contact}} level sensing of highly viscous liquids, as well as bulk solids. They are also widely used in water treatment applications for <b>pump</b> <b>control</b> and open channel flow measurement. The sensors emit high frequency (20 kHz to 200 kHz) acoustic waves that are reflected back to and detected by the emitting transducer. [...] Ultrasonic level sensors are also affected by the changing speed of sound due to moisture, temperature, and pressures.

Within the mine, the player must {{activate}} two pumps and enter the <b>pump</b> <b>control</b> room to lower the water level sufficiently to reach an elevator and escape the factory.

50|$|The {{height of}} the tower {{provides}} the pressure for the water supply system, {{and it may be}} supplemented with a pump. The volume of the reservoir and diameter of the piping provide and sustain flow rate. However, relying on a pump to provide pressure is expensive; to keep up with varying demand, the pump would have to be sized to meet peak demands. During periods of low demand, jockey pumps are used to meet these lower water flow requirements. The water tower reduces the need for electrical consumption of cycling pumps and thus the need for an expensive <b>pump</b> <b>control</b> system, as this system would have to be sized sufficiently to give the same pressure at high flow rates.|$|E
50|$|Conductive level sensors {{are ideal}} for the point level {{detection}} {{of a wide range}} of conductive liquids such as water, and is especially well suited for highly corrosive liquids such as caustic soda, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, ferric chloride, and similar liquids. For those conductive liquids that are corrosive, the sensor’s electrodes need to be constructed from titanium, Hastelloy B or C, or 316 stainless steel and insulated with spacers, separators or holders of ceramic, polyethylene and Teflon-based materials. Depending on their design, multiple electrodes of differing lengths can be used with one holder. Since corrosive liquids become more aggressive as temperature and pressure increase, these extreme conditions need to be considered when specifying these sensors. Conductive level sensors use a low-voltage, current-limited power source applied across separate electrodes. The power supply is matched to the conductivity of the liquid, with higher voltage versions designed to operate in less conductive (higher resistance) mediums. The power source frequently incorporates some aspect of control, such as high-low or alternating <b>pump</b> <b>control.</b> A conductive liquid contacting both the longest probe (common) and a shorter probe (return) completes a conductive circuit. Conductive sensors are extremely safe because they use low voltages and currents. Since the current and voltage used is inherently small, for personal safety reasons, the technique is also capable of being made “Intrinsically Safe” to meet international standards for hazardous locations. Conductive probes have the additional benefit of being solid-state devices and are very simple to install and use. In some liquids and applications, maintenance can be an issue. The probe must continue to be conductive. If buildup insulates the probe from the medium, it will stop working properly. A simple inspection of the probe will require an ohmmeter connected across the suspect probe and the ground reference.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} type of {{electrode}} boiler pumps water from {{the lower part of the}} vessel to an internal header that has nozzles that allow the water to flow to electrodes. Generally the working pressure is maintained at 10 bar. If more pressure is needed (more steam) the controls speed up the pump and flow more water through additional nozzles. As the needed pressure is reached the <b>pump</b> <b>controls</b> the flow of water to obtain the desired steam output (in kg per hour) at the desired pressure. On larger systems the <b>pump</b> can be <b>controlled</b> by a variable frequency drive (VFD) so energy is not wasted.

40|$|Reliability {{of medical}} {{devices such as}} the CARA Infusion <b>Pump</b> <b>Control</b> System is of extreme {{importance}} given that these devices are being used on patients in critical condition. The Infusion <b>Pump</b> <b>Control</b> System includes embedded processors and accompanying embedded software for monitoring as well as controlling sensors and actuators that allow the embedded systems to interact with their environments.

In this paper, we study the application of formal methods to the requirements capture and analysis for the Infusion <b>Pump</b> <b>Control</b> System. Our approach consists of two phases. The first phase is to convert the informal design requirements into a set of reference specifications using a formal system, in this case EFSMs (Extended Finite State Machines). The second phase is to translate the reference specifications to the tools supporting formal analysis, such as SCR and Hermes. This allows us to conclude properties of the reference specifications. Our research goal is to develop a framework and methodology for the integrated use of formal methods in the development of embedded medical systems that require high assurance and confidence...|$|E
