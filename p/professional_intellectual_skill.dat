40|$|When {{the action}} was first taken to reserve time prior to the annual meeting for {{alternative}} sessions, a natural objective of the decision was to provide experiences that would serve the personal and professional needs of Academy members and students to develop and update their practical, <b>professional</b> and <b>intellectual</b> <b>skills.</b> One optimistic expectation of this choice was that participants would be inclined to engage in continuous professional improvement (as in fields like law, medicine, architecture and engineering). Another optimistic expectation was that the attendance at annual meetings would increase because attendees would be provided with a convenient and reasonable justification for travel expenses {{in the absence of}} an invitation to present in the regular sessions. One not so optimistic expectation was that the programming in pre-conference sessions might not be as valuable or interesting as the programming in the regular sessions. The first two expectations were profoundly realized. Member participation in pre-conference activities has increased dramatically.

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on the Law Teacher of the Year keynote speech {{delivered}} at the Association of Law Teachers’ Annual Conference in April 2011 in Cardiff, Wales. Some refinement of the ideas expressed then took place and a further presentation formed my inaugural Readership seminar at Nottingham Law School in June 2011. The essence of the speeches was to seek to address the fitness for purpose of the Qualifying Law Degree (QLD) in the context of contemporary legal education, but more recently has focused the need for the requirements of the QLD better to reflect and promote what is best about law and legal education. Thus, rather than skills being incidental to academic legal study, I suggest that certain discipline-specific cognitive professional skills should replace the foundation subjects in the QLD.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{increasing}} {{complexity of}} work and social life demands that people possess conceptual understanding and <b>intellectual</b> <b>skills</b> {{in order to gain}} the desired level of compe-tence. Unfortunately, the development of high level cognitive skills is a complex task that has not been sufficiently addressed in education. This chapter discusses the nature of intel-lectual skills and identifies numerous problems that educators face when they attempt to emphasize these skills in their curriculum. Through a comparison of the characteristics of formal and informal learning environments, the author identifies four elements of informal learning that guide the creation of high level <b>intellectual</b> <b>skills.</b> Incorporating the four elements of informal learning in formal instruction can lead to robust opportunities for students to gain conceptual understanding and develop their <b>intellectual</b> <b>skills...</b>|$|R

The results showed that their competence in the basic <b>intellectual</b> <b>skills</b> needed to study science effectively was far below standard. This lack of competence could be expected to be detrimental to self-confidence and may also be an important reason for the high failure rate of students in their science courses.

40|$|This project explores research-based {{methods for}} {{creating}} an e-learning resource to teach an <b>intellectual</b> <b>skill.</b> <b>Intellectual</b> <b>skills</b> {{are one of}} the five domains of learning defined by Robert M. Gagné. The <b>intellectual</b> <b>skill</b> taught via the e-learning resource is the rules of Turkish vowel harmony, a fundamental phonological feature of the Turkish language. The purpose of the e-learning resource is to provide novice learners with a set of tools and strategies with which to approach the future study of Turkish. A literature review was conducted in three areas: Gagné’s instructional design theories, Turkish language learning, and best practices for the design of multimedia e-learning. Two rapid prototypes in the form of Moodle course sites were developed. Guidance for improving the prototypes was sought from experts in instructional design, usability, and computer software. The resulting finished e-learning product is a nine-topic Moodle course based on Gagné’s nine events of instruction. The main Moodle course content teaches the rules of Turkish vowel harmony as an <b>intellectual</b> <b>skill</b> which has been broken down into discriminations (the Turkish vowels), concepts (the Turkish vowel groups) and rules (Turkish vowel harmony). Higher order rules are taught in the form of exceptions to the rules of Turkish vowel harmony found in foreign loan-words in Turkish. Practice is provided in applying the rules of Turkish vowel harmony as a set of word attack skills for approaching Turkish language artifacts found online and in the environment. A comprehensive list of resources relating to learning Turkish, learning about the Turkish language, and learning about learning Turkish, is provided to facilitate future extension and application of what was learned in this course. Each lesson is presented {{in the form of a}} Moodle book. Each lesson is followed by an ungraded assessment in the form of an Adobe® PDF quiz. The quizzes and accompanying answer keys are designed to provide guided practice, feedback, and self-assessment to help students extend and apply the lesson material. All lessons were beta-tested to ensure usability and reduction of extraneous cognitive load. The project resulted in the development of a Best Practices Checklist for designing e-learning resources to teach <b>intellectual</b> <b>skills.</b> The Best Practices Checklist, which can be found in Appendix B, was used to develop the outline for e-learning resources to teach <b>intellectual</b> <b>skills</b> in other subject areas and was found to be an effective rapid prototyping and instructional design tool. Insight was gained into the significance of prior knowledge for teaching <b>intellectual</b> <b>skills,</b> and on how to calibrate cognitive load in e-learning design relative to the learner’s prior knowledge of the subject matter being taught...|$|R

40|$|Engineering can be {{considered}} as a broad discipline that embraces knowledge and training in science, mathematics, business and management, social science and computer technology. A wide range of skills can be defined as necessary to an actual engineer. Among them, technical knowledge <b>skills</b> and <b>intellectual</b> <b>skills</b> play a very important role.

40|$|The study {{examined}} {{the extent to which}} type-of-practice strategies (massed or distributed) had an effect on learning a verbal information (reading) or <b>intellectual</b> <b>skill</b> (math) task for second- and fourth-grade students. One hundred and ninety students from eight second- and fourth-grade classrooms participated in the study. Classrooms were randomly assigned to the two practice conditions and all students participated in a 9 - week integrated learning system (ILS) intervention. The present study found that <b>intellectual</b> <b>skill</b> tasks are learned slightly more effectively in a massed than distributed practice mode, though the difference was not statistically significant. Students also learned verbal information tasks more effectively in the massed practice mode, though the difference was not statistically significant. The differences between the two practice conditions were not as great on verbal information tasks, however, and no statistically significant differences were found. Additional analyses, using the number of lesson units completed, showed that having completed a greater number of math lessons had a positive effect on the math test scores. These analyses suggest that a stronger treatment or better adherence to the treatment could have caused a statistically significant effect for massed practice in <b>intellectual</b> <b>skill</b> domains. Replication is needed to provide a more solid foundation for this assertion. It was concluded from this study, due to the moderate effect size differences and the identical cost factor for incorporating the two types of practice, that the use of massed practice would be more prudent for <b>intellectual</b> <b>skill</b> tasks. Massed practice is also more effective in the higher order verbal information area. Strong research inference suggests the continuance of distributed practice for 2 ̆ 2 lower level 2 ̆ 2 tasks, particularly in the verbal information areas.
