Love is the final word. To the rational man it alone gives the super-rational sanction for living. Like Bergson in his overhanging heaven of intuition, or like one who has bathed in Pentecostal fire and seen the New Jerusalem, so I have trod the materialistic dictums of science underfoot, scaled the last peak of philosophy, and leaped into my heaven, which, after all, is within myself.

50|$|Reverend Edwin Garner Weed {{was elected}} {{as the third}} Bishop of the Diocese of Florida in 1886. As Florida {{continued}} to grow, {{it became obvious that}} the state needed to be split into two dioceses, or at least hire a suffragan bishop, but it lacked funds. Thus, bishop Weed suggested that the southern portion be split off as a missionary jurisdiction, and funded through the national church. The General Convention approved in 1892, and so created the Missionary Jurisdiction of Southern Florida, with William Crane Gray elected its missionary bishop. Thus, the original dioceses southern boundary came to include Levy, Alachua, Putnam & St. Johns counties. After the split, the Diocese of Florida contained 43 missions and 13 parishes, but fewer than 3,000 members. Bishop Weed decided to move his seat from St. Augustine to Jacksonville because transportation was more readily available. He accomplished the move by 1895, but severe freezes in 1896 & 1897 destroyed most of North Floridas citrus industry and the Great Fire of 1901 in Jacksonville left the diocese broke. The following year, however, all parishes and missions made their Diocesan <b>payments</b> <b>in</b> <b>full.</b> Moreover, by 1906, the diocese had more than 50 parishes and missions, served by 33 clergy. In 1913, Bishop Weed realized that the missionary Southern diocese had grown much more rapidly than the original diocese, due to the expansion of railroad service to Tampa and Key West. He suggested returning Marion and Volusia Counties to the original diocese, but that suggestion failed when only one of the thirteen parishes in the missionary district agreed. In addition, the Womans Auxiliary gained importance and became a major source of funds during the early 1900s. Their efforts helped keep many churches from closing their doors. Bishop Weed died in 1924.|$|R
3000|$|The {{different}} {{characteristics of}} utilization and progress {{decisions in the}} domain of time lead us to derive separate hypotheses for the impact of the time delay between subsequent decisions on the sunk-cost effect. Again, we first focus on utilization decisions. Prelec and Loewenstein (1998) integrate Thaler’s (1980, 1985) idea of mental accounts in an evaluation of consumption and payment events. They specify that consumers feel the pain of paying at the time of product purchase, which must be deducted from the pleasure of consumption. Their model comes with two main assumptions: prospective accounting and coupling. Prospective accounting postulates that consumers mentally depreciate past payments, but consider future <b>payments</b> <b>in</b> their <b>full</b> amount. <b>In</b> coupling, individuals create a psychological link between the payment and the consumption of a transaction. In line with their argumentation, coupling moderates the impact of payment on consumption such that the pain of paying attenuates consumption utility and the consumption pleasure buffers the pain of paying. The imputed costs are the highest right after payment and decrease over time. Gourville and Soman (1998) label this gradual adaptation to sunk costs {{with the passage of time}} as payment depreciation. Consequently, the sunk-cost effect should be more present in temporal proximity to the payment. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis: [...]...|$|R

40|$|Until recently, a {{foreclosure}} on an owner‐occupied {{home in the}} United States was a relatively rare event. According to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA), foreclosure proceedings were initiated on approximately 0. 3 percent of all owner‐occupied housing units with a mortgage in each quarter from 1979 :Q 1 through 2006 :Q 2 (figure 1). Since mid‐year 2006, foreclosure proceedings have more than tripled and now occur {{at the rate of}} at least 1 percent per quarter. To place these percentages in context, in the 27 1 / 2 year period between 1979 and mid‐ 2006, a cumulative total of 7. 5 million foreclosure proceedings had been initiated at a rate of 275, 000 per year. In the 3 1 / 2 year period between mid‐ 2006 and year‐end 2009, 6 million foreclosure proceedings had been initiated, at a rate of 1. 7 million per year, a more than 6 ‐fold increase. The conditions for high foreclosure rates are in place {{for at least the next}} two years, suggesting that another 4 to 5 million owner‐occupied homes will enter into foreclosure in 2010 and 2011. What is a Foreclosure? A house is seized by a mortgage lender in {{a foreclosure}} proceeding after three steps have occurred. First, the homeowner fails to make contractually obligated mortgage payments, a condition commonly known as default. If homeowners fail to make one or two monthly payments, they are known as 30 ‐ and 60 ‐days delinquent, respectively. In many of these cases, the homeowner “self‐cures ” by making the missed <b>payment(s)</b> <b>in</b> <b>full</b> and paying an additional (contractually pre‐specified) penalty. Once a homeowner misses three consecutive monthly payments, the homeowner is known as 90 ‐days delinquent and the probability increases that the house will end up in foreclosure (Tanta 2007). In the second step, the lender initiates foreclosure proceedings. This process varies by state and can take between 6 and 18 months to complete. In the third and final step, the court system assigns the ownership of the house back to the mortgage lender. In some states, after a foreclosure occurs lenders may try to obtain a “deficiency judgment, ” which implies that the foreclosed homeowner must compensate the lender in an amount equal to the difference between the value of the house after the foreclosure and the outstanding loan balance of the mortgage (Ghent and Kudlyak 2009) ...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} paper is to determine the adequacy of Deepwater Horizon Economic Settlement <b>payments</b> <b>in</b> achieving <b>full</b> recovery and restoration of the Gulf Coast economy. This paper contextualizes the event, analyzes other disaster techniques, and discusses the impact of the oil spill on dominant coastal industries. The results are constructed through linear regression models on employment figures for the coastal counties of all five Gulf states. An argument for each state is formed based upon the regression results, supplemented with outside sources and additional data as needed. So as to narrow the scope of the project, only data for counties on the Gulf Coast are included. Limitations of the study are discussed in the conclusion. The key findings are as follows: • The Deepwater Horizon Economic Settlement reparation payments have been adequate for the economic recovery of Texas and Florida. • The Deepwater Horizon Economic Settlement reparation payments have been sufficient for economic growth in Louisiana. Slight additional compensation may be needed to achieve complete recovery. • The Deepwater Horizon Economic Settlement reparation payments have been inadequate for the economic recovery of Mississippi and Alabama.

Although many do not prefer to do business through countertrade, trade experts have concluded that world economic conditions have made countertrade a necessary financing mechanism for countries that cannot pay cash for their imports. In order to trade with these countries and to open up new markets in countries with limited resources, United States companies must educate themselves about the advantages and drawbacks of countertrade. Countertrade by United States firms raises a host of legal issues, including the application of United States trade laws, antitrust laws, and other federal regulatory concerns. Countertrade arrangements are subject to the application of United States trade laws. The current official United States government policy is sometimes contradictory.
