40|$|The growing {{variety of}} {{parallel}} computers {{has made it}} difficult to design <b>portable</b> <b>tools</b> for parallel programs. This paper shows how an interactive visualization tool can be designed to work with a variety of parallel machines. The design includes a strategy for adapting to differences in the interfaces and capabilities of the low-level debuggers supplied by hardware vendors. Our tool uses these debuggers to perform basic tasks like setting breakpoints and examining variables. By dividing each interaction between the visualization tool and the "base debugger" into a sequence of customizable steps, we can write code that adapts cleanly and efficiently to differences in the debuggers. This design has been implemented in the Panorama parallel debugger, which runs on several message-passing multicomputers. 1 Introduction As new parallel architectures proliferate, portability has become an important feature of parallel programming tools. <b>Portable</b> <b>tools,</b> including debuggers, are useful for [...] ...|$|E

40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT REQUEST OF AUTHOR. ] This {{research}} {{explores the}} application of ultrasonic stress measurement (USM) technologies to assess stress levels in gusset plates {{with the development of}} a small <b>portable</b> <b>tool</b> for in-situ condition assessment. The I- 35 W bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota collapsed {{as a result of an}} overstressed (under-designed) gusset plate. Currently, the analytical tools used to assess the adequacy of gusset plates depend on assumed loading based on the intended design configuration of the bridge and conventional tools such as strain gages. The research team has previously developed a methodology for ultrasonic stress measurements in steel plates. This technology utilizes acoustic birefringence to analyze principal stresses. The birefringence measurement evaluates the normalized velocity difference of orthogonally polarized shear waves propagating through the plate. The birefringence varies proportionally as a function of strain in the steel. For verification, laboratory and field test were undertaken to compare ultrasonic stress measurements with stress measurements obtain via conventional strain gages. This project reports on research intended determine parameters and conditions necessary for total-stress measurements and the development of a <b>portable</b> <b>tool</b> that provides bridge engineers with quantitative, easy-to-interpret measurements of the in-situ forces carried in bridge members...|$|R

40|$|Introducing new {{information}} and communication technologies is a way to increase the revenue for oil and gas companies. The expected added value of enabling these integrated operations is NOK 250 billion just in the next few years. A portable display device connected to a video camera can increase both the efficiency and the safety during emergency situations. Based on a feasibility study, it has been demonstrated how such additional <b>portable</b> <b>tools</b> can increase the capabilities of the two existing StatoilHydro systems HazVac and Medical Unit. HazVac gives a better overview of emergency situations. RFID tracking of plant personnel and video surveillance cameras are activated in an intelligent environment when wireless sensors alarm fires or gas leaks. Medical Unit improves the collaboration between offshore nurses and onshore doctors by using video conferencing and data sharing. Stops in production at the processing plant at Tjeldbergodden cost StatoilHydro NOK 6 million a day. Deploying HazVac can possibly decrease the damages by earlier and more detailed warnings of fires and gas leaks. It will be a good investment if it can prevent or at least reduce standstill time. Most important however are health and life. Both HazVac and Medical Unit can improve the safety of the personnel. The wireless sensor networks can help preventing human injuries, while calculation of safe routes will optimise evacuations. Real-time video collaboration can moreover improve the medical treatment of the patients. Field operators can communicate with these two systems by their <b>portable</b> <b>tools.</b> They can send and receive real-time video as well as access vital information. Requirements for this portable tool have been specified. Based on these, an initial system design has been made. A demonstration system has been implemented, demonstrated and evaluated. Further software implementation has to be done. There are also some challenges in finding hardware which do satisfy the specified requirements, and further evaluations are needed. </p...|$|E
