50|$|The {{prosecutor}} {{are obliged}} to lead and direct the preliminary investigations of a crime impartially and objective, make decisions on prosecution issues, and appear in court to process actions in criminal cases. Suspects {{are entitled to a}} <b>public</b> <b>defence</b> <b>counsel,</b> either during the preliminary investigation stage or during the trial. The suspect is entitled to examine the material gathered by the prosecutor, and is allowed to request the police to conduct further investigation, if he or she considers this to be necessary. A preliminary investigation supervisor decides whether or not these measures can be carried out.|$|E
40|$|The term “Access to Justice” (AtJ) {{refers to}} the {{fundamental}} notion that all people – even disadvantaged groups of society – should enjoy effective legal/judicial protection, ultimately through the courts. Accordingly, the principal targets of the AtJ-movement’s criticism have been so called “Access Barriers”, i. e. different legal and/or practical obstacles that make it difficult, or even impossible, {{for the general public}} to turn to the courts in order to vindicate their rights. The most significant barrier is legal fees in general, and counsel fees in particular. In a vast number of cases, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has concluded that law – substantive as well as procedural – is a rather complicated matter, which is often unintelligible to the layperson. Consequently, many self-represented litigants are neither accorded effective access to court (AtC), nor a fair trial – simply because they lack the skills necessary to present their case properly and competently. Therefore, the right to counsel has gradually evolved into a fundamental human right – not just in criminal cases, but also under the civil head of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Before Swedish courts, the parties to a dispute are always free to hire an attorney to conduct their case. In this narrow sense, the “right to counsel” is unconditional under Swedish law – both before the general courts and the administrative courts. In practice, however, the right to be assisted by counsel is conditional, since hiring a lawyer is always associated with a cost. In this way, a right that is theoretically bestowed on all is de facto denied many by the realities of economics. Or as the saying goes: “Justice is open to all; like the Ritz Hotel. ” It is an undeniable fact that most litigants {{will not be able to}} obtain counsel, if counsel fees are not covered by a legal aid and/or legal protection insurance scheme, or at least reimbursed through cost shifting rules. Against this background, this thesis examines how counsel fees are handled before Swedish courts in relation to the imbricated notions of AtJ and AtC. More specifically, the thesis discusses (1) “party funding” (i. e. cost shifting), (2) “public funding” (i. e. legal aid) and (3) “third-party funding” (i. e. legal insurance), with a comparative perspective on the Swedish civil, criminal and administrative procedure. Since a right to counsel can be derived from Article 6 of the ECHR, Swedish law is also compared with the case law of the ECtHR. Lastly, the thesis criticises “simplification of procedure” as an unrealistic alternative to lawyer-conducted litigation, at least in court proceedings which are adversarial in structure. The thesis argues that all people are not guaranteed equal AtJ in Sweden and that Swedish law – in some respects – is not even in compliance with the standards set by the ECtHR. With regard to the general courts, it is argued that the rules concerning assignment of <b>public</b> <b>defence</b> <b>counsel</b> are constructed in a way that infringes the suspect’s fair trial rights under Article 6. Before administrative courts, moreover, it is argued that the absence of legal aid (as well as legal insurances), combined with a default application of the American (“no-way” fee shifting) rule give rise to Access Barriers, since most individual parties (usually “one shot litigants”) are forced to proceed pro se in disputes against highly skilled adversaries, viz. state and municipal agencies (“repeat player litigants”). In view of this asymmetry, it is asserted that self-represented litigants are not always guaranteed effective access to a court/a fair trial...|$|E
40|$|Some {{academics}} {{and government officials}} have implicated <b>defence</b> <b>counsel</b> as the primary ‘villains’ in lengthy case processing times in Ontario bail courts. It {{has been suggested that}} <b>defence</b> <b>counsel</b> contribute to increasing case processing time through their use of ‘unproductive’ adjournments. This study examines this allegation through semi-structured interviews with <b>defence</b> <b>counsel</b> who practise in one Eastern Ontario bail court. The findings put the evidence that blames <b>defence</b> <b>counsel</b> into context and show that the explanations for their conduct are more complex than they may initially appear. They also reveal several explanations for bail inefficiency which are unrelated to the role of <b>defence</b> <b>counsel</b> but correspond grosso modo to the traditional factors associated with lengthy case processing time in the broader court process. The study concludes that although <b>defence</b> <b>counsel</b> are partly responsible for lengthy case processing times in bail court, they are only one contributor among many others...|$|R

40|$|Participation of the Counsel in the Preliminary Proceedings A {{right of}} defence is one of basic rights of {{democratic}} state of law. It is contained in various international treaties and also in our constitution, namely in article 40 of Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms. In case of criminal procedure it is further adjusted in Criminal Procedure. Representation by a <b>defence</b> <b>counsel</b> {{is one of the}} main ways how to fulfill a right of <b>defence.</b> A <b>defence</b> <b>counsel</b> becomes essential compoment of criminal procedure. Especially in preliminary procedure is <b>defence</b> <b>counsel</b> and his services irreplaceable. For that reason I decided to examine the role of <b>defence</b> <b>counsel</b> in preliminary procedure. My diploma thesis consists of five chapters, whilst first chapter is introduction and last conclusion. First chapter is an introduction into topic of {{right of defence}} and role of <b>defence</b> <b>counsel</b> in criminal procedure. It also deals with legal sources of right of defence and its brief history form 1873 Criminal procedure until recent Criminal procedure. In second chapter of my thesis I deal with right of defence in general and with different concepts in several subheads.

40|$|This {{rigorous}} theme {{focuses on}} the position of <b>defence</b> <b>counsel</b> in the preliminary proceeding because {{the participation of the}} <b>defence</b> <b>counsel</b> on the criminal procedure is a contemporary topic, both from the theoretical and practical point of view. The theme of this thesis describes the development and strenghtening of the position of the <b>defence</b> <b>counsel</b> from the historical perspective as well as based on the evolution of jurisprudence. The core of the presentation theme is to define the position of the <b>defence</b> <b>counsel</b> as well as his / her rights and obligations in the preliminary proceeding. The <b>defence</b> <b>counsel</b> has guaranteed "defending" rights for all phases of the criminal proceeding {{due to the fact that}} the accused person has the right to be defended. This theme brings added value (especially from the perspective of its potencial use) to everyone due to the fact that the role of the <b>defence</b> <b>counsel</b> and his presence already in the pre-judical phase of the criminal proceeding is of vital importance not only for the proper enforcement of the right to be defended granted to the accused but also for the other phases of the criminal proceeding.

40|$|The Statutes {{of the ad}} hoc Tribunals grant prosecutorial staff {{functional}} immunity, {{which aims}} to protect them against undue interference by states. <b>Defence</b> <b>counsel,</b> however, is not mentioned.
