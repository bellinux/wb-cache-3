40|$|Abstract. In sports timetabling, {{creating}} an appropriate timetable for a round-robin tournament with home–away assignment {{is a significant}} problem.

40|$|Abstract. The pattern mining {{community}} has shifted its attention from local pattern mining to <b>pattern</b> <b>set</b> mining. The task of <b>pattern</b> <b>set</b> mining {{is concerned with}} finding a <b>set</b> of <b>patterns</b> that satisfies a set of constraints and often also scores best w. r. t. an optimisation criteria. Furthermore, while in local pattern mining the constraints are imposed {{at the level of}} individual <b>patterns,</b> in <b>pattern</b> <b>set</b> mining they are also concerned with the overall <b>set</b> of <b>patterns.</b> A wide variety of different <b>pattern</b> <b>set</b> mining techniques is available in literature. The key contribution of this paper is that it studies, compares and evaluates such search strategies for <b>pattern</b> <b>set</b> mining. The investigation employs concept-learning as a benchmark for <b>pattern</b> <b>set</b> mining and employs a constraint programming framework in which key components of <b>pattern</b> <b>set</b> mining are formulated and implemented.

After several modifications this ended in the 1990 s and with the present mix of industry and company bargaining there is little coordination.

Thus, the same elastic matching-based metric is consistently used at the standard <b>pattern</b> <b>setting</b> stage and the recognition stage with the proposed technique, whereas different metrics are inconsistently used in those stages with the conventional technique.

30|$|How might {{different}} bargaining structures {{deal with}} the problem? The authors envisage three such structures: peak-level coordination, pattern bargaining (termed intermediate coordination), and uncoordinated systems. The core problem of peak-level coordination is uncertainty {{as to whether the}} redistributional compromise as set by the median affiliate holds, and this is said to depend on vertical coordination, namely whether the affiliates can bind lower levels (see Traxler et al. 2001). Accordingly, peak-level coordination is characterized by either high governability or low governability. For its part, pattern bargaining with <b>pattern</b> <b>setting</b> by the exposed sector can theoretically fix percentage increases in pay below overall productivity growth while maintaining traditional differentials in favor of the trading sector. There results a moderate rate of increase in wages, where the pattern defines the ceiling for other settlements. Finally, since uncoordinated single-employer bargaining theoretically has the advantage of at all times achieving internalized pay settlements, there is supposedly neither the need nor the ability of the bargainers under perfect competition to respond to intersectoral heterogeneity. This advantage evaporates where there is imperfect competition in product markets, price setting power allowing externalized wage increases.|$|E
40|$|<b>Pattern</b> <b>set</b> mining entails {{discovering}} {{groups of}} frequent itemsets that represent potentially relevant knowledge. Global constraints are commonly enforced {{to focus the}} analysis on most interesting <b>pattern</b> <b>sets.</b> However, these constraints evaluate and select each <b>pattern</b> <b>set</b> individually based on its itemset characteristics. This paper extends traditional global constraints by proposing a novel constraint, called schema-based constraint, tailored to relational data. When coping with relational data itemsets consist of sets of items belonging to distinct data attributes, which constitute the itemset schema. The schema-based constraint allows us to effectively combine all the itemsets that are semantically correlated with each other into a unique <b>pattern</b> <b>set,</b> while filtering out those <b>pattern</b> <b>sets</b> covering a mixture of different data facets or giving a partial view of a single facet. Specifically, it selects all the <b>pattern</b> <b>sets</b> that are (i) composed only of frequent itemsets with the same schema and (ii) characterized by maximal size among those corresponding to that schema. Since existing approaches are unable to select one representative <b>pattern</b> <b>set</b> per schema in a single extraction, we propose a new Apriori-based algorithm to efficiently mine <b>pattern</b> <b>sets</b> satisfying the schema-based constraint.

30|$|The {{effectiveness}} of trend-setting arrangements {{depends on whether}} the negotiators of the <b>pattern</b> <b>setting</b> agreement are {{able and willing to}} ‘internalize’ the pressures of international competitiveness and changing labour markets. This might be the case if the internationally exposed sector takes the lead. The stability of <b>pattern</b> <b>setting,</b> including wage moderation if need be, depends on a degree of centralisation and authority that is perhaps less than central wage bargaining but still formidable. This is nowhere clearer than in Austria where both the union and employers’ side hold an absolute monopoly of representation, backed by the law, and can therefore not be challenged from without. In Germany it is the sheer might of the IG Metall in combination with the size, success and prestige of the car industry. In Norway and Denmark it is possible to end disputes over the renewal of agreements by means of a single mediation procedure for the entire private sector, empowering the mediator to treat several settlements as one entity in the ballot (Elvander 2003). This is a strong centralising element in an otherwise decentralised system of wage setting like the Danish one and a method to gag independent unions and out-of-step employers, for instance in the Norwegian oil industry. Mediation institutions were set up in all four Nordic countries in the early 20 th century (Elvander 1990), but these institutions have been weaker in Sweden, where a strong doctrine of freedom from state interference in these matters had prevailed (Elvander 2002 : 210). This was addressed in the 1997 Industry Agreement between the industrial engineering employers and a cartel of ten unions. The agreement established a private-law mediation institute, a permanent joint structure with impartial chairpersons for negotiations and a sectoral Economic Council with four independent academic economists. Elvander and Holmlund (1997) judge these institutions as prerequisite for decentralized wage formation in a highly organized economy with powerful unions. In 2009 the employers in industrial engineering Employers Federation gave notice to the 1997 agreement, but it was renewed in 2011 with more power for impartial mediators, stricter negotiation rules and stronger incentives to maintain the manufacturing industry’s wage leadership role. This came after a challenge during the recession, when some unions pushed hard for the norm to be set by the commercial services sector rather than by a manufacturing sector which was experiencing tremendous difficulties in exports and sales, and was rapidly losing jobs (Kjellberg 2012). In the 2011 bargaining rounds, following some recovery, the industry sector prevailed however, though with the salaried employees rather than the blue-collar unions, settling first and thus establish the pattern.|$|E

40|$|Background: A deep {{understanding}} of what causes the phenotypic variation arising from biological patterning processes, cannot be claimed before {{we are able to}} recreate this variation by mathematical models capable of generating genotype-phenotype maps in a causally cohesive way. However, the concept of pattern in a multicellular context implies that what matters is not the state of every single cell, but certain emergent qualities of the total cell aggregate. Thus, in order to set up a genotype-phenotype map in such a spatiotemporal <b>pattern</b> <b>setting</b> one is actually forced to establish new pattern descriptors and derive their relations to parameters of the original model. A pattern descriptor is a variable that describes and quantifies a certain qualitative feature of the pattern, for example the degree to which certain macroscopic structures are present. There is today no general procedure for how to relate a set of patterns and their characteristic features to the functional relationships, parameter values and initial values of an original pattern-generating model. Here we present a new, generic approach for explorative analysis of complex patterning models which focuses on the essential pattern features and their relations to the model parameters. The approach is illustrated on an existing model for Delta-Notch lateral inhibition over a two-dimensional lattice. Results: By combining computer simulations according to a succession of statistical experimental designs, computer graphics, automatic image analysis, human sensory descriptive analysis and multivariate data modelling, we derive a pattern descriptor model of those macroscopic, emergent aspects of the patterns that we consider of interest. The pattern descriptor model relates the values of the new, dedicated pattern descriptors to the parameter values of the original model, for example by predicting the parameter values leading to particular patterns, and provides insights that would have been hard to obtain by traditional methods. Conclusion: The results suggest that our approach may qualify as a general procedure for how to discover and relate relevant features and characteristics of emergent patterns to the functional relationships, parameter values and initial values of an underlying pattern-generating mathematical model...|$|E

Each composer represented here sought out his own musical identity, struggling with style and genre, yet their works last into the present due to an honest and respectful approach. This struggle is mirrored as music students face a constant barrage from society {{to take a more}} practical and lucrative career path, yet we follow the music in our heart. Against all odds, we play our trade, just as our musical forefathers have done. Antonin Dvonik (1841 - 1904) served as one of the lynchpins in the Czech nationalistic movement during the Romantic era. His use of Czech folk song and poetry continued to build a uniquely Czech musical sense that his predecessors had begun. He composed in many genres, and the Ziguenermelodien (Gypsy Melodies), Op. 55 was one of his most crucial compositions in his work with art song. The set of seven songs highlights the freedom, love, and strong tendency towards music in the gypsy lifestyle and culture. Within the poetry of "Mein Lied ertont," the vocalist exclaims that his song will resound: when the day begins to sink, in the green halls of the forest, and finally when his brother has died. Likewise, the tonality from a minor key to a major key, and back to a minor key to match the focus of the poetry. In "Rings ist der Wald so stumm und still," Dvorak creates the setting of the quiet forest with a somber, descending, arpeggiated accompaniment and a sustained vocal line. The voice moves mostly in quarter and half notes creating the sense of stillness and loneliness that is spoken of in the text. The fourth piece in the cycle, "Als die alte Mutter" stands as a strong representative of Dvonik' s output of art song, combining a relatively simple melody with a challenging rhythmic <b>pattern</b> <b>setting</b> the piano accompaniment in a 6 / 8 pattern against the 2 / 4 pattern of the vocalist. The entirety of Henri Duparc???s (1848 - 1933) existing musical output consists of thirteen songs composed in the period 1868 - 1884. He abandoned composition at the age of 36, and eventually fell into blindness and paralysis. Despite his short-lived musical career, Duparc heavily influenced the state of French melodie by his strong sense of emotional and artistic sensibility. (See more in text. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the pursuit}} of {{alternatives}} to optical lithography, block copolymer directed self-assembly (DSA) {{has emerged as a}} low-cost, high-throughput option. DSA uses small topographical templates to contain the block copolymer and create small clusters of holes useful for patterning vias [1]. However, issues of defectivity have hampered DSA's viability for large-scale patterning. Recent studies have shown polymer fill level to be a crucial factor in defectivity, as template overfill can result in malformed DSA structures [2]. The inherent density variations in via layouts, though, make regions of overfilled templates nearly inevitable, as templates in less dense regions will contain more polymer. For this reason, we develop a method to integrate sub-DSA resolution assist features (SDRAFs) into DSA template layouts. The SDRAFs divert excess polymer from the overfilled main templates but are themselves too small to form transferrable DSA patterns [2]. Thus, we can populate low-density regions with SDRAFs to make a layout more uniformly dense. To do this, we use SDRAFs with a set of lithography-based design rules dictating the minimum pitch and resist thickness between features (95 nm and 45 nm for 193 i, respectively). The SDRAF CD is also chosen to be as large as possible without forming a transferrable DSA <b>pattern,</b> <b>setting</b> it at 40 nm for an L 0 = 40 nm polymer and a PS wetting flow. With these rules, we set a flow for the assignment of each SDRAF according to the calculated density of templates in each block. We demonstrate the process on a 2. 5 x 2. 5 Î¼m section from V 23 (the via layer connecting metals 2 and 3) of a routed N 7 Cortex-M 0 processor scaled to a 24 nm via layout grid. We first overlay the template layout with a grid of SDRAFs spaced at 96 nm, allowing the SDRAFs to align with the via grid. We then remove the SDRAFs that violate the minimum resist or pitch rules and assess the density result. This is done by dividing the layout into blocks and calculating the percentage of area occupied by the main and assist templates in the blocks, using prior experimental data for template area [3]. The size of the blocks is set to the length over which the polymer reflows during the thermal anneal [4], assumed here to be about 500 nm. Finally, the SDRAF grid is shifted vertically and horizontally in increments of the via grid (24 nm) to achieve different density results, as each shift causes different SDRAFs to be in violation. We can then choose the shift that minimizes the density variation across the blocks as the final layout. In our test case, we found that the density range of the blocks changed from 2. 8 - 8. 6 % to 10. 9 - 12. 9 % post-SDRAF assignment. Here, the polymer film thickness can be adjusted to accommodate the higher overall density and the narrowed density range shows promise to reduce template overfill. Future work will incorporate methods of improving the layout's PV band to create an SDRAF design strategy that is more DSA- and lithography-friendly. [1] H. Yi et al., Adv. Mater 24, 23 (2012).

One cannot {{say that}} the idea of industry-wide bargaining has been among the main preoccupations of employers and unions in Canada. While management seems to resist the idea, labor does not present a clear-cut policy on the subject. In fact, our decentralized collective bargaining system has been mostly criticized by scholars for the last few years. THE CLASSICAL ANALYSIS OF THE INDUSTRY-WIDE BARGAINING SYSTEMLet us note at the beginning that within the structure of labor-management relations, the centers of decisions have tended to move towards higher levels due to the centralization of power from the union local to the federation within our labor movement. Our second remark would be that a leading firm in a given industry will probably set the negotiation pattern for the entire sector. Even if this <b>pattern</b> <b>setting</b> negotiation is not industry-wide bargaining as such, the results are very much the same. It is thus a generalized trend that union will tend to structure negotiation {{in such a way that}} it will enhance wage and working conditions standardization within a given sector. On the other hand, the employers will form associations when they are faced with a multi-union bargaining. Industry-wide bargaining is therefore as much accepted as it seems necessary to the institutionnal security of both parties at the negotiation table. It would be interesting to look at the advantages of such a negotiation. 1. —While reducing competition in wages and working conditions, industry-wide bargaining may help to stabilize employment conditions of a greater number of employees and give the enterprises a better knowledge of their labor costs. 2. —Information tools and research teams are more at hand with such a negotiation. Agreements tend to be more rational, more objective and more thoughtful of social implications. 3. —Industry-wide bargaining tend to prevent unjustified competition between unionized and non-unionized sectors. 4. —Rationalization is much more possible in an industry-wide bargaining. 5. —It is possible for the partners to follow public income and price policies. Let us now turn to the disadvantages of industry-wide bargaining presented mainly by those who support decentralized collective bargaining. 1. —Such a negotiation system will ruin the principle of the free enterprise system :competition. 2. —It can lead to greater government intervention. 3. —The principle of free and democratic unionism would be in danger. 4. —The industry-wide bargaining system could introduce a disasterous uniformity in wages and working conditions. 5. —Labor disputes would be much more dangerous for the community. INDUSTRY-WIDE BARGAINING AND THE PRESENT ECONOMIC SITUATION IN QUEBECA social and economic policy is necessary if we want the industry-wide bargaining system to be adapted to the present situation. It is however evident that this type of negotiation will take different forms according to the problems involved. This does not mean that everything must be sent to the sector level. It is evident that some problems are to be settled at the local levels while others are to be included in industry-wide bargaining. In order to be realistic, I must mention some of the difficulties the Quebec situation presents to such a bargaining system. One may seriously wonder if the Quebec industrial structure is ready for such a formula. It seems that the Quebec economy is characterized by a small degree of product diversification, by an important exportation policy and by a cultural and management clash between the large enterprise, the medium sized and the small firm. All of these present serious difficulties to the installation of an industry-wide bargaining system. SOME NECESSARY CHANGES IN THE QUEBEC LABOR LAWOne thing is sure: our law must not be an obstacle to industry-wide bargaining. It however actually forbids such a type of negotiation. The certification section of the Labor Code should be amended in order to favorise greater unionization. The determination of the bargaining unit policy should be revised. The content of the collective agreement should be redefined by the legislator. The conciliation procedures should not be considered as a necessary step before obtaining the right to strike or lock-out. Our law should favor the creation of joint committees at all levels. Finally, it would be wise to reconsider all the present system of arbitration especially for the problems regarding the application of the agreement...|$|E
40|$|Many {{algorithms}} for {{sequence analysis}} rely on word matching or word statistics. Often, these approaches {{can be improved}} if binary patterns representing match and don't-care positions are used as a filter, such that only those positions of words are considered that correspond to the match positions of the patterns. The performance of these approaches, however, depends on the underlying patterns. Herein, we show that the overlap complexity of a <b>pattern</b> <b>set</b> that was introduced by Ilie and Ilie {{is closely related to}} the variance of the number of matches between two evolutionarily related sequences with respect to this <b>pattern</b> <b>set.</b> We propose a modified hill-climbing algorithm to optimize <b>pattern</b> <b>sets</b> for database searching, read mapping and alignment-free sequence comparison of nucleic-acid sequences; our implementation of this algorithm is called rasbhari. Depending on the application at hand, rasbhari can either minimize the overlap complexity of <b>pattern</b> <b>sets,</b> maximize their sensitivity in database searching or minimize the variance of the number of pattern-based matches in alignment-free sequence comparison. We show that, for database searching, rasbhari generates <b>pattern</b> <b>sets</b> with slightly higher sensitivity than existing approaches. In our Spaced Words approach to alignment-free sequence comparison, <b>pattern</b> <b>sets</b> calculated with rasbhari led to more accurate estimates of phylogenetic distances than the randomly generated <b>pattern</b> <b>sets</b> that we previously used. Finally, we used rasbhari to generate patterns for short read classification with CLARK-S. Here too, the sensitivity of the results could be improved, compared to the default patterns of the program. We integrated rasbhari into Spaced Words; the source code of rasbhari is freely available at [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1998 In this research, we have captured, in pattern form, key {{elements}} of programming and design in four programming paradigms (imperative, object-oriented, functional and logical) as well as multiparadigm programming. These <b>pattern</b> <b>sets</b> have formed a foundation upon which {{we were able to}} build a deeper understanding of multiparadigm programming and design. For each paradigm, we identified <b>sets</b> of programming <b>patterns.</b> We then identified design patterns for those paradigms that already have design methodologies (imperative and object-oriented). For those that do not (functional and logical), we created design <b>pattern</b> <b>sets</b> that may yet play a seminal role in formal design methodologies for those paradigms. From the relationships between programming and design patterns, we were able to identify and record methodological patterns that provide generative mappings between programming patterns and design <b>patterns.</b> From the <b>sets</b> of programming <b>patterns,</b> we were able to derive a <b>pattern</b> <b>set</b> for multiparadigm programming. We were also able to perform a critical analysis of the multiparadigm programming language Leda using this <b>pattern</b> <b>set.</b> Finally, we were able to apply the methodological patterns to this multiparadigm programming <b>pattern</b> <b>set</b> to aid in our search for multiparadigm design patterns. We were also able to derive insight into multiparadigm design patterns by studying the <b>pattern</b> <b>sets</b> {{for each of the four}} paradigms studied. Armed with this rich pattern system, we then created and presented a new pattern-based methodology for multiparadigm design. Finally, we applied our methodology and our <b>pattern</b> <b>sets</b> to three common design problems. We found that this new methodology lent new insights into software design, and suggested the role that multiparadigm programming and design can play in many aspects of software creation...|$|R

Nowadays, the increasing network bandwidth and <b>pattern</b> <b>set</b> size both calls for high speed string {{matching algorithm}} for large-scale <b>pattern</b> <b>set.</b> This paper proposes a novel algorithm called Multi-phase Dynamic Hash (MDH), which cut down the memory requirement by multi-phase hash and explore valuable <b>pattern</b> <b>set</b> information to speed up searching procedure by dynamic-cut heuristics. The experimental results demonstrate that MDH can improve matching performance by 100 % to 300 % comparing with other popular algorithms, whereas the memory requirement stays in a comparatively low level...|$|R

40|$|Local pattern mining is an {{integral}} part of a variety of approaches in data mining and machine learning. Especially in data mining, a lot of research exists on how to mine local patterns efficiently from large data bases. As a side-effect, the resulting pattern collections are far too big to be useful. In machine learning, on the other hand, local patterns are ingredients to more complex models used for classification, or clustering, for instance. In both cases, efficiently and effectively assembling those local <b>patterns</b> into <b>sets</b> of <b>patterns</b> is an important task. In this thesis, we present a in-depth discussion of various aspects of <b>pattern</b> <b>set</b> mining. The thesis has three main contributions. The first one is the introduction of a formal framework for <b>pattern</b> <b>set</b> mining as a distinct task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such a formal definition has been given. By identifying types of <b>pattern</b> <b>sets,</b> properties of those types, and developing constraints based on these properties, the framework enables the principled discussion of existing and future <b>pattern</b> <b>set</b> mining techniques...|$|R
