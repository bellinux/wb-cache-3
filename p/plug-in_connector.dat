The new model is equipped with an electric drive engine power system, whose main component is produced by the German company Vossloh Kiepe, a four pole asynchronous motor with a maximum power of 120 kW (163 HP) and maximum torque of 1400 Nm. The energy to power the motor is stored in two liquid-cooled lithium batteries with a total capacity of 120.9 kWh and a rated voltage of 600V, which is made by Wamtechnik in Poland. The maximum charging time for two batteries with a total weight of 1400 kg at a 63A 3x400V loading terminal is 4 hours and can be accessed via a <b>plug-in</b> <b>connector</b> by Walter company. Regenerative braking is used to extend battery life by recovering energy from momentum back into the battery when slowing The maximum range of 100 km, and the bus is able to reach a top speed which is limited to 50 km/h. The brake coil reduces the rate of acceleration of the bus. Electric batteries {{have been used to}} replace compressors driven by an internal combustion engine, so in addition to the drive system there is an energy source for all other systems on the bus, including power steering, heating, ventilation and the electrically control doors. Electrical system is based on CAN bus.|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a coaxial high-frequency <b>plug-in</b> <b>connector</b> for connecting {{a large number}} of coaxial lines, whereby the plug-in terminals of the coaxial lines are placed directly adjacent to each other in a row and are surrounded by a common housing. Each individual coaxial line is connected to a base housing, whereby the base housing is in turn situated in common intermediate carriers. The intermediate carrier is surrounded by the overall housing. In the intermediate carrier itself or in the intermediate carrier together with the overall housing, there are apertures and recesses which serve to bear the base housing, whereby the base housing can be moved in the recesses or apertures. As a result of the electrically conducting design of the walls of the apertures or recesses, a high-frequency-tight chamber is formed for connecting coaxial lines and plugs.

In this case, the application fields are instrumentation and control (I&C) installations. The long service duration of these semi-permanent contacts throughout their lifetime relies on having a stable force.

The main results are that insertion force and friction coefficient of contact change after thousands of insertion-extraction cycles. To avoid these parameters (insertion force and friction coefficient μ) that change during mating cycle, an innovative diagnostic tool has been investigated, to directly measure, in situ, the contact force of each spring of the connector. © 2011 INCDMTM...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} several {{methods to}} increase the detection threshold and to improve the localization accuracy of PD by means of non-conventional UHF PD measurement. A simple and commonly used way to locate PD in GIS is the measurement in time domain (time-offlight). The time difference between the arrivals of the PD impulse on two UHF sensors is used for localization. The new developed method presented here uses the frequency domain. The basic idea is the displacement law of Fourier transformation. The interference phenomena of superposed signals from two sensors give information about the time delay of the sensor signals. This new method allows a more cost-effective localisation of PD in GIS. On-site PD measurements are made at cable connectors, while the cable is in service. A barrel sleeve, acting as an electromagnetic screen, is clamped around the <b>plug-in</b> <b>connector.</b> Inside the sleeve there are monopole antennas to detect electromagnetic waves emitted from PD within the connector. Thus a sensitive PD measurement even in noisy environment is possible. PD-measurements in an unshielded laboratory were performed on several 45 kV cable connectors. Connectors with stimulated PD emitted fast electromagnetic pulses whereas measurements on connectors without PD showed only slight background noise. So the detection of UHF PD signals constitutes a strong sign for internal P...|$|E
40|$|The {{reliability}} of the {{printed circuit board assembly}} under dynamic environments, such as those found onboard airplanes, ships and land vehicles is receiving more attention. This research analyses the dynamic characteristics of the printed circuit board (PCB) supported by edge retainers and plug-in connectors. By modelling the wedge retainer and connector as providing simply supported boundary condition with appropriate rotational spring stiffnesses along their respective edges with the aid of finite element codes, accurate natural frequencies for the board against experimental natural frequencies are obtained. For a PCB supported by two opposite wedge retainers and a <b>plug-in</b> <b>connector</b> and with its remaining edge free of any restraint, it is found that these real supports behave somewhere between the simply supported and clamped boundary conditions and provide a percentage fixity of 39. 5 % more than the classical simply supported case. By using an eigensensitivity method, the rotational stiffnesses representing the boundary supports of the PCB can be updated effectively and is capable of representing the dynamics of the PCB accurately. The result shows that the percentage error in the fundamental frequency of the PCB finite element model is substantially reduced from 22. 3 % to 1. 3 %. The procedure demonstrated the effectiveness of using only the vibration test frequencies as reference data when the mode shapes of the original untuned model are almost identical to the referenced modes/experimental data. When using only modal frequencies in model improvement, the analysis is very much simplified. Furthermore, the time taken to obtain the experimental data will be substantially reduced as the experimental mode shapes are not required. In addition, this thesis advocates a relatively simple method in determining the support locations for maximising the fundamental frequency of vibrating structures. The technique is simple and does not require any optimisation or sequential search algorithm in the analysis. The key to the procedure is to position the necessary supports at positions so as to eliminate the lower modes from the original configuration. This is accomplished by introducing point supports along the nodal lines of the highest possible mode from the original configuration, so that all the other lower modes are eliminated by the introduction of the new or extra supports to the structure. It also proposes inspecting the average driving point residues along the nodal lines of vibrating plates to find the optimal locations of the supports. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate its validity. By applying to the PCB supported on its three sides by two wedge retainers and a connector, it is found that a single point constraint that would yield maximum fundamental frequency is located at the mid-point of the nodal line, namely, node 39. This point support has the effect of increasing the structure's fundamental frequency from 68. 4 Hz to 146. 9 Hz, or 115 % higher...|$|E

40|$|To {{meet the}} energy {{requirement}} of electrical components in industrial power applications, <b>plug-in</b> electrical <b>connectors</b> with contact fins are used. With a contact resistance below 0, 1 mQ this connector type can deliver currents of 100 A and higher. For {{the selection of}} the suitable connector size with limited available space or cooling, the designer needs an understanding how the connector reacts to electrical currents, including continuous load and pulse overload conditions. As datasheets typically include no information about pulse overload conditions, we developed a method to establish a thermo-electrical model for calculating the hot-spot temperature in the connector. Based on a literature study, absolute maximum ratings for the internal hot-spot temperature are discussed. With Infrared (IR) thermal imaging measurements on the connector time-dependent temperature readings were gathered for current pulses up to 8000 Arms and a pulse duration of 100 ms. Geometry and m aterial information were determined to build a transient thermal-electric finite elements method (FEM) model. For some parameters like contact area and thermal contact resistance an inverse modelling technique was applied, comparing simulation results and measurements. Based on the model, hot-spot temperature and location could be identified. As the FEM model took several hours to be calculated, we derived a lumped thermal system model from the full model, representing the FEM model by a Foster network. The network is only able to calculate the hot-spot temperature, but with a calculation time of seconds...|$|R

40|$|The Tile {{calorimeter}} {{is one of}} the sub-detectors of ATLAS. In {{order to}} ensure its proper operation and assess the quality of data, many tasks are to be performed by means of many tools which were developed independently to satisfy different needs. Thus, these systems are commonly implemented without a global perspective of the detector and lack basic software features. Besides, in some cases they overlap in the objectives and resources with another one. It is therefore evident the necessity of an infrastructure to allow the implementation of any functionality without having to duplicate the effort while being possible to integrate with an overall view of the detector status. -in-ONE is intended to meet these needs, by providing a unique system, which integrates all the web systems and tools used by the Tile calorimeter, with a standard development technology and documentation. It also intends to abstract the user from knowing where and how to get the wanted data by providing a user friendly interface. It is based in a server containing a core, which represents the basic framework that loads the configuration, manages user settings and loads plugins at run-time; a set of services, which provide common features to be used by the <b>plug-ins,</b> such as <b>connectors</b> to different databases and resources; and the plug-ins themselves which provide features at the top level layer for the users.

40|$|Connectivity is {{a problem}} in telemedicine. Data has to be {{acquired}} from devices and transferred to the recipient. In europe at present telemonitoring programs especially focus on home monitoring. Only few of these projects support patient’s mobility. The technical setup in these projects usually requires identical devices for all participating patients. This applies to the communication device (e. g. a mobile phone or smart phone) and the medical device (e. g. a blood pressure meter) as well. To be able to use these devices patients have to be trained as well. Furthermore on travel patients use and carry their own phone containing all their contacts and further data. The idea of the Plug&Care-Connector (PCC) is to provide a technology that enables service providers to reduce costs in mobile or home monitoring setups. It’s a Java-based middleware for different operating systems like Android, Windows Mobile, PC-Windows, Apple-OS or Linux. The PCC consists of a core application designed for each of the mentioned operating systems. It abstracts the platforms interface medical devices connect to presenting one identical interface. Thus device manufacturers only need to develop one PCC-driver to be able to connect to all supported platforms. Patients are able to use their (PCC-compatible) smart phone or PC they are familiar with when participating in a telemonitoring program. If their medical device is PCC-compatible as well they can use it too. This can reduce technology costs significantly and can increase patient’s compliance as well. Furthermore the Plug&Care-Connector supports so called transmitters. Transmitters are <b>plug-ins</b> for the <b>connector</b> responsible to forward the acquired data of the medical device. Transmitters can easily be written using our developer guide. Transmitters hand over the data or to apps running locally (e. g. diabetes diaries) or forward it to remote recipients. Various messaging services and export to data bases and patient records are supported. The first version will be provided in the Android-market. We will test the Plug&Care-Connector with Diabetes patients within the EU-AAL-project EmotionAAL in Finland and Germany in early 2012. ...|$|R
