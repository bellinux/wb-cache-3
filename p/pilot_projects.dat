25|$|The Block Island Wind Farm was {{conceived}} as a larger project extending into neighboring Massachusetts to build a $1.5-billion, 385-megawatt wind farm in federal waters. The 100-turbine project could provide 1.3terawatt-hours (TW·h) of electricity per year – 15percent of all electricity used in the state. In 2009, the State of Rhode Island designated Deepwater Wind to begin with <b>pilot</b> <b>projects.</b> In that year Deepwater {{signed an agreement with}} National Grid to sell the power from the wind farm off Block Island, at an initial price of 24.4¢/kW·h.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, {{the private}} concessionaires in Casablanca, Tangiers and Tetouan, {{as well as}} the public water utility of Meknes began to {{implement}} water supply and sanitation <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> on the basis of an innovative output-based aid approach. The objective is to extend water and sewer connections to 11.300 households in poor, unzoned, periurban neighbourhoods. The <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> are part of the National Human Development Initiative and are funded through a US$ 7 million grant by the Global Partnership for Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) administered by the World Bank. It {{is the first time that}} GPOBA, which promotes primarily the private sector, provided grants to a public water operator. The average subsidy level per connection amounts to USD 169 for water supply and to USD 606 for sanitation. The average subsidy level per connection is 35 percent. Operators also developed awareness raising campaigns to make people aware of the option to connect to sewers through teams that go to market places. Under the output-based aid approach investments are pre-financed by the concessionaires or the public utility that are being reimbursed by GPOBA only after a verification process certifies that the households have been connected and receive an adequate service. According to the World Bank, the output-based aid approach has helped to improve processes, overcome financing obstacles and mobilize stakeholder partnership.|$|E

Fifteen states expressed interest in having the pilot program and, ultimately, five states submitted applications to be considered for HIP. Hampden County, Massachusetts was selected as the Healthy Incentives Pilot (HIP) site. HIP is designed to take place from August 2010 to April 2013 with the actual operation phase of the pilot program scheduled to last 15 months, from November 2011 to January 2013.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{credit union}} history dates from 1852, when Franz Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch {{consolidated}} the learning from two <b>pilot</b> <b>projects,</b> one in Eilenburg {{and the other}} in Delitzsch in the Kingdom of Saxony into what are generally recognized as the first credit unions in the world. He went on to develop a highly successful urban credit union system. In 1864 Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen founded the first rural credit union in Heddesdorf (now part of Neuwied) in Germany. By the time of Raiffeisen's death in 1888, credit unions had spread to Italy, France, the Netherlands, England, Austria, and other nations.|$|E
25|$|Political officials, policymakers, administrators, {{and service}} {{providers}} were increasingly willing {{to recognize the}} relevance of a substantial body of scientific research that suggested effective intervention strategies that could {{change the course of}} the epidemic. Also, major policy recommendations with regard to behavioral interventions were preceded by small <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> that showed feasibility or efficacy in those populations at highest risk. Once the evidence base was documented, both the policymakers and politicians publicly showed their support for HIV prevention and care, as well as passing legislation to enforce and broadly disseminate health practices (e.g., routine HIV testing and access to care).|$|E
