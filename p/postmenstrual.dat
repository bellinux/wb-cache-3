60|$|It {{had better}} be stated here and now {{at the outset that}} the perverted transcendentalism to which Mr S. Dedalus' (Div. Scep.) contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly {{addicted}} runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods. Science, it cannot be too often repeated, deals with tangible phenomena. The man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can. There may be, it is true, some questions which science cannot answer--at present--such as the first problem submitted by Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) regarding the future determination of sex. Must we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary (the <b>postmenstrual</b> period, assert others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture of both? This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature's favourite devices) between the nisus formativus of the nemasperm {{on the one hand and}} on the other a happily chosen position, succubitus felix of the passive element. The other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality. It is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways. Mr M. Mulligan (Hyg. et Eug. Doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc. by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust. These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas--these, he said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race. Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner. Mr J. Crotthers (Disc. Bacc.) attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide. Although the former (we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative. In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions. An ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by Mr V. Lynch (Bacc. Arith.) that both natality and mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in fine, in nature's vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained. Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet's words, give us pause. Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest. Mr S. Dedalus' (Div. Scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to. For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother. In a recent public controversy with Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) which took place in the commons' hall of the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, of which, as is well known, Dr A. Horne (Lic. in Midw., F. K. Q. C. P. I.) is the able and popular master, he is reported by eyewitnesses as having stated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag (an esthete's allusion, presumably, to one of the most complicated and marvellous of all nature's processes--the act of sexual congress) she must let it out again or give it life, as he phrased it, to save her own. At the risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered.|$|E

5000|$|Android fat {{distribution}} {{describes the}} distribution of human adipose tissue mainly around the trunk and upper body, {{in areas such as}} the abdomen, chest, shoulder and nape of the neck. This pattern may lead to an [...] "apple-shaped" [...] body or central obesity, and is more common in males than in females. Thus, the android fat distribution of men is about 48.6%, which is 10.3% higher than that of premenstrual women. In other cases, an ovoid shape forms which does not differentiate between men and women.Generally during early adulthood, females tend to have a more peripheral fat distribution such that their fat is evenly distributed over their body. However, it has been found that as females age, bear children and approach menopause, this distribution shifts towards the android pattern of fat distribution [...] resulting in a 42.1% increase in android body fat distribution in <b>postmenstrual</b> women.

In order to interpret these findings, cellular processes have to be taken into consideration, especially those governing the pruning of axons, dendrites and synapses until an adult pattern of whole-brain connectivity is achieved (which can best be monitored using diffusion-weighted techniques).|$|E

40|$|AIM—To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} gestation, <b>postmenstrual</b> age, and orotracheal intubation on palate morphology.  METHODS—A prospective study was made of 76 newborn infants of 25 to 41 weeks' gestation. Palate dimensions were measured on plaster models produced from serial palatal impressions. Palate size relative {{to that of the}} mouth was assessed using a ratio of palate depth to palate width (Palatal Index).  RESULTS—Palate depth and width were related to <b>postmenstrual</b> age and gestation. Palatal Index ranged from 0. 15 to 0. 57, indicating a wide variation in palate shape, but gestation and <b>postmenstrual</b> age had no effect. Prolonged intubation had a small effect, equivalent to an increase in palatal depth of less than 2 mm at 32 weeks' <b>postmenstrual</b> age. The effect was transient.  CONCLUSION—Prolonged orotracheal intubation (> 10 days) leads to a small and temporary increase in palatal depth. However, this is unlikely to account for palatal grooving, which is probably caused by an overgrowth of the lateral palatine ridges. ...|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{assess the}} effect of early {{parenteral}} amino acids, on growth and neurodevelopment of very low birth weight infants at 36 weeks’ <b>postmenstrual</b> age and 18 months’ corrected age. Material and Method: Infants who received ≥ 3 gr/kg per day of parenteral amino acids within the first 5 days of life were considered early group; infants who receive < 3 gr/kg per day of parenteral amino acids within the first 5 days of life were considered late group. Infants’ weight, length and head circumference were measured et 36 weeks’ of <b>postmenstrual</b> age and 18 months’ of corrected age. Nerodevelopmental index was evaluated by “Bayley Scales of Infant Development”. Results: There were no statistically differences between the early and late amino acid groups in baseline characteristics; except birth weight. At 36 weeks’ <b>postmenstrual</b> age and 18 months’ corrected age, there were no statistically differences in weight, length and head circumference between the two groups. In the early group, female babies had bigger head circumference than male babies at 36 weeks’ <b>postmenstrual</b> age and 18 months’ corrected age.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Vitamin B(6) plays {{a pivotal}} role in brain {{development}} and functioning. Differences in vitamin B(6) homeostasis between preterm and term newborn infants have been reported. The authors sought to investigate whether B(6) vitamers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of preterm and term newborn infants are different. METHODS: B(6) vitamer concentrations were determined in 69 CSF samples of 36 newborn infants (26 born preterm and 10 born term) by ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. CSF samples, taken from a subcutaneous intraventricular reservoir, were bedside frozen and protected from light. RESULTS: Concentrations of pyridoxal (PL), pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), pyridoxic acid (PA), and pyridoxamine (PM) in preterm newborns (<b>postmenstrual</b> age 30 - 37 weeks) were at least twice as high as in older newborns (<b>postmenstrual</b> age ≥ 42 weeks). Pyridoxine and pyridoxamine phosphate concentrations were below limits of quantification in all newborns. In CSF of 2 very preterm newborns (<b>postmenstrual</b> age < 30 weeks), significant amounts of pyridoxine were present besides high concentrations of PL, PA, and PM, whereas PLP concentrations were relatively low. B(6) vitamers in CSF were positively correlated, especially PA, PLP, and PL. CONCLUSIONS: In CSF of newborn infants, PL, PLP, PA, and PM are present, and concentrations are strongly dependent on <b>postmenstrual</b> age. Our results indicate that vitamin B(6) homeostasis in brain differs between preterm and term newborns.

40|$|Background: Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the associations between Premenstrual Syndrome and perceived stress, and no studies quantifying stress based on biochemical parameters have been conducted. Objectives: The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the changes in biochemical parameters of stress and measured perceived stress during the menstrual cycle of women with premenstrual syndrome. Patients and Methods: A longitudinal observational study was conducted in 2010 in the Kansai region of Japan. Thirteen women with premenstrual syndrome and 11 controls, all with regular menstrual cycles, participated in this study. Salivary secretory immunoglobulin A (S-IgA) and cortisol levels were measured as biochemical parameters, and scores on the Stress Check List KM (SCL-KM) (Cronbach’s α in this study ranged from 0. 76 to 0. 84) were used to indicate perceived stress through two complete menstrual cycles. Before stress measurements were taken, premenstrual, menstrual and <b>postmenstrual</b> phases were confirmed based on records of basal body temperature across two menstrual cycles. Data analysis was performed using the Student’s t-test, analysis of variance with repeated measures, and Pearson’s correlation coefficient, as appropriate. Results: Both the <b>postmenstrual</b> S-IgA concentration and secretion rate were significantly lower in the group with premenstrual syndrome than in controls (P < 0. 05). Premenstrual S-IgA concentrations were significantly higher than <b>postmenstrual</b> levels in the group with premenstrual syndrome (P < 0. 05). No significant differences in cortisol levels were seen in either group during any phase. Premenstrual and <b>postmenstrual</b> phase SCL-KM scores were significantly higher in the group with premenstrual syndrome than in controls (P < 0. 05). No significant changes in the SCL-KM scores were observed among menstrual cycle phases in either group. <b>Postmenstrual</b> S-IgA levels were negatively correlated with the SCL-KM score (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: The stress due to psychosomatic changes in the menstrual cycle is associated with premenstrual syndrome. Measures of S-IgA, rather than cortisol or subjective responses to stress, may be most closely associated with PMS...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Adverse neurodevelopmental {{outcome is}} common in {{children}} born preterm. Early sensitive predictors of neurodevelopmental outcome such as MR imaging are needed. Tract-based spatial statistics, a diffusion MR imaging analysis method, performed at term-equivalent age (40 weeks) is a promising predictor of neurodevelopmental outcomes in children born very preterm. We sought to determine the association of tract-based spatial statistics findings before term-equivalent age with neurodevelopmental outcome at 18 -months corrected age. MATERIALSANDMETHODS: Of 180 neonates (born at 24 – 32 -weeks ’ gestation) enrolled, 153 hadDTI acquiredearly at 32 weeks ’ <b>postmenstrual</b> age and 105 had DTI acquired later at 39. 6 weeks ’ <b>postmenstrual</b> age. Voxelwise statistics were calculated by performing tract-based spatial statistics on DTI that was aligned to age-appropriate templates. At 18 -month corrected age, 166 neonates underwent neurodevelopmental assessment by using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 3 rd ed, and the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales, 2 nd ed. RESULTS: Tract-based spatial statistics analysis applied to early-acquired scans (<b>postmenstrual</b> age of 30 – 33 weeks) indicated a limited significant positive association between motor skills and axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity values in the corpus callosum, internal and external/extreme capsules, and midbrain (P. 05, corrected). In contrast, for term scans (<b>postmenstrual</b> age of 37 – 41 weeks), tract-based spatial statistics analysis showed {{a significant relationship between}} both motor and cognitive scores with fractional anisotropy in the corpus callosum and corticospinal tracts (P. 05, corrected). Tract-based spatial statistics in a limited subset of neonates (n 22) scanne...|$|E

It is rotined that for sportswomen the special capacity changed to on by the phases of menstrual cycle. It describable: by the increase of anaerobic possibilities (postovulatory and <b>postmenstrual</b> phase); by the decline of biotpower possibilities (menstrual, ovulatory, premenstrual phase), large metabolic tension of organism, high cost of vegetative functions. It is set that at most sportswomen the best indexes of the special capacity are marked in <b>postmenstrual</b> and postovulatory phases.

40|$|Background: A {{caesarean}} section (CS) {{can cause a}} defect or disruption of the myometrium {{at the site of}} the uterine scar, called a niche. In recent years, an association between a niche and <b>postmenstrual</b> spotting after a CS has been demonstrated. Hysteroscopic resection of these niches is thought to reduce spotting and menstrual pain. However, there are no randomised trials assessing the effectiveness of a hysteroscopic niche resection. Methods/Design: We planned a multicentre randomised trial comparing hysteroscopic niche resection to no intervention. We study women with <b>postmenstrual</b> spotting after a CS and a niche with a residual myometrium of at least 3 mm during sonohysterography. After informed consent is obtained, eligible women will be randomly allocated to hysteroscopic resection of the niche or expectant management for 6 months. Discussion: This trial will provide insight in the (cost) effectiveness of hysteroscopic resection of a niche versus expectant management in women who have <b>postmenstrual</b> spotting and a niche with sufficient residual myometrium to perform a hysteroscopic niche resection.

40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the retinal vascularization process after intravitreal ranibizumab {{was administered to}} infants with aggressive posterior retinopathy of prematurity (AP-ROP). Methods: Twenty-six eyes of 13 infants with AP-ROP who received 0. 25 mg intravitreal ranibizumab were retrospectively investigated. The patients were evaluated at weekly follow-up visits, and the findings were analyzed after retinal vascularization was complete. Results: The results showed regression in the AP-ROP of all the patients within the first 48 - 72 h. Average time for complete vascularization of the nasal quadrant (zone II) was <b>postmenstrual</b> week 45 (range 41 - 56), and vascularization of the temporal quadrant (zone III) was completed in the <b>postmenstrual</b> week 56 (range 50 - 65). Reactivation was observed in seven patients, on average at <b>postmenstrual</b> week 42; two of these patients underwent additional treatment. Two patients presented with avascular areas in the peripheral retina despite being 1 year old. Conclusion: These results showed that retinal vascularization following intravitreal ranibizumab was completed after a delay in patients with AP-ROP. Further studies are necessary to evaluate when and how vascularization occurs after intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatments...|$|E
40|$|The {{prognostic}} {{value of}} abnormal EEG transients {{was investigated in}} 362 subjects submitted to EEG recording during the neonatal age and followed-up {{at least until the}} 12 th month of corrected age. The incidence of negative and positive spikes and sharp waves, of rhythmic sharp theta and delta activities and of alpha discharges were evaluated by means of a quantitative score. These abnormal EEG transients appeared to be generally rare and even absent in a large number of subjects. In infants with normal outcome their incidence tends to increase from low <b>postmenstrual</b> ages towards term period. Full-term newborns with abnormal neurological outcome presented a significantly higher incidence of these transients. Preterm infants with unfavourable evolution showed a higher incidence only when submitted to EEG recording at around term age. However, no difference between subjects with normal and abnormal outcome was detected in preterm infants when evaluated at low <b>postmenstrual</b> ages. The hypothesis that at low <b>postmenstrual</b> ages brain damage might, on the one hand, give rise to abnormal transients and, on the other, alter the 'capability' of manifesting them (together with other EEG maturational aspects), might explain these results...|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{study the}} {{prevalence}} of niches in the caesarean scar in a random population, and the relationship with <b>postmenstrual</b> spotting and urinary incontinence. Design A prospective cohort study. Setting A teaching hospital in the Netherlands. Population Non-pregnant women delivered by caesarean section. Methods Transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) and gel instillation sonohysterography (GIS) were performed 6 - 12 weeks after caesarean section. Women were followed by questionnaire and menstruation score chart at 6 - 12 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after caesarean section. Main outcome measures Prevalence of a niche 6 - 12 weeks after caesarean section, using TVU and GIS. Secondary outcomes: relation to <b>postmenstrual</b> spotting and urinary incontinence 6 and 12 months after caesarean section; and niche characteristics, evaluated by TVU and GIS. Results Two hundred and sixty-three women were included. Niche prevalence was 49. 6 % on evaluation with TVU and 64. 5 % with GIS. Women with a niche measured by GIS reported more <b>postmenstrual</b> spotting than women without a niche (OR 5. 48, 95 % CI 1. 14 - 26. 48). Women with residual myometrium {{at the site of}} the uterine scar measuring 50 % of the adjacent myometrial thickness (OR 6. 13, 95 % CI 1. 74 - 21. 63). Urinary incontinence was not related to the presence of a niche. Conclusions A niche is present in 64. 5 % of women 6 - 12 weeks after caesarean section, when examined by GIS. <b>Postmenstrual</b> spotting is more prevalent in women with a niche and in women with a residual myometrial thickness of < 50 % of the adjacent myometrium. © 2013 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists...|$|E
40|$|Background: More than 50 {{percent of}} all infants born very preterm will {{experience}} significant motor and cognitive impairment. Provision of early intervention is dependent upon accurate, early identification of infants at risk of adverse outcomes. Magnetic resonance imaging at term equivalent age combined with General Movements assessment at 12 weeks corrected age is currently the most accurate method for early prediction of cerebral palsy at 12 months corrected age. To date no studies have compared the use of earlier magnetic resonance imaging combined with neuromotor and neurobehavioural assessments (at 30 weeks <b>postmenstrual</b> age) to predict later motor and neurodevelopmental outcomes including cerebral palsy (at 12 – 24 months corrected age). This study aims to investigate i) the relationship between earlier brain imaging and neuromotor/ neurobehavioural assessments at 30 and 40 weeks <b>postmenstrual</b> age, and ii) their ability to predict motor and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 3 and 12 months corrected age. Methods/design: This prospective cohort study will recruit 80 preterm infants born ≤ 30 week’s gestation and a reference group of 20 healthy term born infants from the Royal Brisbane & Women’s Hospital in Brisbane, Australia. Infants will undergo brain magnetic resonance imaging at approximately 30 and 40 weeks <b>postmenstrual</b> age to develop our understanding of very early brain structure at 30 weeks and maturation that occurs between 30 and 40 weeks <b>postmenstrual</b> age. A combination of neurological (Hammersmith Neonatal Neurologic Examination), neuromotor (General Movements, Test of Infant Motor Performance), neurobehavioural (NICU Network Neurobehavioural Scale, Premie-Neuro) and visual assessments will be performed at 30 and 40 weeks <b>postmenstrual</b> age to improve {{our understanding of the}} relationship between brain structure and function. These data will be compared to motor assessments at 12 weeks corrected age and motor and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 12 months corrected age (neurological assessment by paediatrician, Bayley scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Alberta Infant Motor Scale, Neurosensory Motor Developmental Assessment) to differentiate atypical development (including cerebral palsy and/or motor delay). Discussion: Earlier identification of those very preterm infants at risk of adverse neurodevelopmental and motor outcomes provides an additional period for intervention to optimise outcomes.
