40|$|Fair use is one {{of modern}} law 2 ̆ 7 s most {{fascinating}} and troubling doctrines. It is amorphous and vague, and notoriously difficult to apply. It is, at the same time, vitally important in copyright {{and perhaps the most}} frequently raised and litigated issue in the law of intellectual property. This article offers a novel theory of fair use that provides both {{a better understanding of the}} underlying principles and better tools for applying the doctrine. In contrast with the dominant understanding of fair use in the literature — that fair use addresses market failure — the article proposes viewing fair use as a doctrine that aims at calibrating the allocation of uses among authors and the public. Specifically, fair use allocates directly to users certain privileges expected to maximize utility for the public. The fair use doctrine, we argue, is an integral part of copyright 2 ̆ 7 s sorting mechanism for, on the one hand, granting authors intellectual property rights based on their expected incentives for creation and, on the other, granting the public privileges based on the expected utility from direct allocation. The article 2 ̆ 7 s theory thus accords with recent Supreme Court cases by conceptualizing fair use not as an exception for costly transactions, but rather as a central feature of the copyright system that ensures productive efficiency. This theory supports a reconceptualization of the basic structure of copyright law that both broadens fair use and makes the doctrine easier to apply. This article favors a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> <b>finding</b> of fair use whenever the user’s category of use is one that produces widespread follow-on utility to non-users (such as the categories of political speech or what we call 2 ̆ 2 truth-seeking 2 ̆ 2). This <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> <b>finding</b> can only be defeated by showing that allowing such uses with respect to this particular copyrighted work would eliminate sufficient incentives for its creation...|$|E

With recourse to construction drawings, a digital plan, photographic evidence, and various forms of textural evidence, we emphasize {{the role played by}} musical ratios in Kahn's thinking about architecture. The Salk is widely regarded as a coauthored work, the product of a unique collaboration between scientist Jonas Salk and architect Louis Kahn. Not dissimilarly, the paper is coauthored by a geometer and an historian, the former having the role of identifying proportions, the later charged with reconciling <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> <b>findings</b> with other available evidence: job correspondence, oral histories, known influences, etc. The research is occasioned, naturally, by the Nexus 2008 conference venue and the Salk's commanding presence north of San Diego, but it also highlights a way in which artifacts, texts and narrative can be given equal consideration when historical inquiry and geometrical analysis are coupled in a joint enterprise...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} guarantees {{with a special}} emphasis on the option method of guarantee valuation. The existing domestic and international literature does not present a comprehensive debate on guarantee valuation with a sufficient discussion {{of the role of}} the guarantor. In addition, a minimal number of sources are devoted to the option valuation of guarantees applied to non-traded companies (and their structures) typical for the Czech Republic, which might inter alia have led to the marginal practical experience of the Czech valuation experts with the method. Following the identified blind spots of the current knowledge, the thesis primarily (i) presents coherent theoretical underpinnings of guarantee valuation, (ii) provides a proposed option valuation approach to guarantee valuation and (iii) demonstrates through a case study of the HAME holding an application of the proposed approach, including an evaluation of its strengths and weaknesses. Based on an analysis and synthesis of the domestic and international literature, a poll among the Czech valuation institutes and a numerical application on the historic HAME holding case, the author observes the following main findings: (i) on a theoretical bases, the option guarantee valuation method presents a plausible way of analysis, (ii) the proposed option valuation approach is applicable in the Czech praxis. Despite these positive <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> <b>findings,</b> the option valuation approach shall be subject to further testing, comparisons with competing methods and improvements resulting from an increased number of its practical applications...|$|R

According to the eliminativist understanding, basic duties do not ground distinct derivative duties, but replace (eliminate) them.

5|$|Cochrane's work forms {{part of the}} {{political}} turn in animal ethics—that is, the emergence of academic literature exploring the normative aspects of human/nonhuman animal relationships from a political perspective. He is known for his interest-based account of animal rights, a theory of justice according to which animals have rights based on their possession of normatively-significant interests. The account is a two-tiered one, with individuals' strong interests grounding <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> rights, and some <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> rights becoming concrete, or all-things-considered, rights. In this picture, the violation of concrete rights, but not necessarily <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> rights, represents an injustice. In particular, Cochrane argues that sentient animals' interests against suffering and death ground <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> rights against the infliction of suffering and death. These <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> rights convert to concrete rights in, for example, animal agriculture and animal testing, meaning that killing nonhuman animals or making them suffer for these purposes is unjust.|$|R
50|$|Ross gives a list {{of seven}} <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> duties, which he does not claim is all-inclusive: fidelity; reparation; gratitude; non-maleficence; justice; beneficence; and self-improvement.

Someone could have a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> duty of reparation, say, a duty {{to help people who}} helped you move house, move house themselves, and a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> duty of fidelity, such as taking your children on a promised trip to the park, and these could conflict. Nonetheless, there can never be a true ethical dilemma, Ross would argue, because one of the <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> duties in a given situation is always the weightiest, and over-rules all the others. This is thus the absolute obligation or absolute duty, the action that the person ought to perform.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Prima</b> <b>facie</b> ( [...] , , or from <b>prīmā</b> <b>faciē)</b> is a Latin {{expression}} meaning on {{its first}} encounter or at first sight. The literal translation would be [...] "at first face" [...] or [...] "at first appearance", from the feminine forms of primus ("first") and facies ("face"), both in the ablative case. In modern, colloquial and conversational English, a common translation would be, [...] "on the face of it". The term <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> is used in modern legal English (including both civil law and criminal law) to signify that upon initial examination, sufficient corroborating evidence appears to exist to support a case. In common law jurisdictions, <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> denotes evidence that, unless rebutted, would be sufficient to prove a particular proposition or fact. The term is used similarly in academic philosophy. Most legal proceedings, in most jurisdictions, require a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case to exist, following which proceedings may then commence to test it, and create a ruling.|$|R
40|$|Two years ago, in University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, the Supreme Court {{decided that}} a {{plaintiff}} in a Title VII retaliation case must prove but-for causation between his protected conduct and a defendant’s decision to take an adverse employment action against him. Although the Court was focusing only on the plaintiff’s ultimate burden of proof, several courts have interpreted Nassar’s pro-employer outcome as raising the burden plaintiffs must meet when attempting to establish a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case. These courts are no longer accepting close temporal proximity between a plaintiff’s protected activity and the employer’s adverse employment action as being sufficient to establish the causal connection element of the plaintiff’s <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case. As a result, plaintiffs in several jurisdictions are finding {{it more difficult to}} establish their <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> cases and are therefore losing at summary judgment. In this Article, I argue that although Nassar raised the ultimate burden for a plaintiff bringing Title VII retaliation claims, courts that are applying Nassar to the <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case stage are applying Nassar incorrectly. There are four reasons these courts should not be raising the burden on a Title VII retaliation plaintiff as he is attempting to establish a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case. First, the Supreme Court and all federal courts have consistently stated that establishing a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case should not be a difficult task, and applying Nassar to conclude that close temporal proximity is not sufficient to establish the causal connection element of the <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case contradicts that directive. Second, despite what several courts believe, Nassar did not address a plaintiff’s burden at the <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case stage; it simply addressed a plaintiff’s ultimate burden of proving but-for causation. Third, raising the burden on a plaintiff at the <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case stage will allow employers to avoid scrutiny of their alleged reasons for the adverse employment actions, and it is when employers are forced to provide those reasons that employers’ true motives are often discovered. And finally, any concern that not raising the burden at the <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case stage will result in frivolous EEOC charges and/or complaints in federal court is unwarranted. It is for these reasons that courts should not be using Nassar to raise a plaintiff’s burden at the <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case stage, but rather they should be using Nassar only for evaluating whether a plaintiff has met his ultimate burden of proving but-for causation...|$|R
40|$|A Rossian Just War Theory revises {{and extends}} the {{projects}} begun by Childress and O‘Connor, {{who argued that}} just war theory ought {{to be based on}} Rossian <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> duties. The project also leans heavily on the work of Michael Walzer and Jeff McMahan. This project will initiate a fourth segment, jus ante bellum, or justice before the war. ^ As an ethics of warfare based in <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> duties, the first question is what is necessary to justify overriding the duty of non-injury? The central idea is that the group of just war principles, together, must be satisfied in order to override the duty of non-injury. Articulating these principles in terms of <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> duties is covered in the first chapter. Two subsequent chapters address {{the question of how to}} ground jus ante bellum and jus post bellum in a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> duties framework? Jus ante bellum responsibilities are grounded in a duty to protect human rights and can be instances of overriding the duties of non-injury and fidelity. Chapter two introduces a picture of the <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> duties of the state in order to explicate jus ante bellum duties and fulfill <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> duties. Chapter three develops the idea of the <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> duties of the state in order to formulate a set of jus post bellum principles for an ethical set of restrictions on post-conflict reconstruction. ^ The final two chapters focus on challenges facing a <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> just war theory. Chapter four concerns the question is how to handle individual judgments when the soldier has an obligation to fight and thus to override their <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> duty of non-injury, but in their analysis the conditions of a just war have not obtained, and thus there is no moral justification for overriding non-injury. Chapter five covers the problem of supreme emergencies, tackling the question of whether it can be permissible to override non-combatant immunity in order to prevent horrific consequences. ...|$|R

Next, this article focuses on Reeve 2 ̆ 7 s identification of 2 ̆ 2 strength of the <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case 2 ̆ 2 as a factor to be considered on summary judgment, and discusses why it would be unwise and unworkable to interpret the words 2 ̆ 2 <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case 2 ̆ 2 in that factor as having the same meaning as the 2 ̆ 2 <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case 2 ̆ 2 proved in the first stage of the McDonnell Douglas framework. Finally, this article explains how and why courts should prevent the <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case from 2 ̆ 2 popping up 2 ̆ 2 again in the third stage of the McDonnell Douglas analysis, where it would distort and disrupt the court from conducting a fair and reasoned evaluation of whether a plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s discrimination claim should go to a jury. This article contends that {{it is a mistake to}} allow the <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case to play a significant role in the third stage of the McDonnell Douglas analysis. Additionally, this article explains how the Aikens decision offered crucial insight into the proper role of the <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case in adjudging discrimination claims, and correctly concluded that the prime facie case should not be considered after the employer has presented a reason for its challenged action. Finally, this article argues that the Reeves decision, by making 2 ̆ 2 strength of the <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case 2 ̆ 2 a factor to be eonsidered at the final stage of the McDonnell Douglas analysis, threatens to give the traditional <b>prima</b> <b>facie</b> case far greater weight than is sensible or just...|$|R

If accessing alternatives is the source of children’s difficulty, then they would be expected to perform better if the requisite alternatives are made explicit, as sub-strings of the asserted sentences.
