25|$|The {{avionics}} of the P version {{included the}} AN/ASN-91B armament control and navigation system, which consisted primarily of the Navigation/Weapon Delivery Computer (NWDC), {{air data computer}} (ADC), Flight Data Computer (FDC), AN/AVQ head-up display (HUD), ASCU/JBOX armament pylon station control unit, <b>projected</b> <b>map</b> <b>display</b> system (PMDS), and was equipped with the AN/ASN-90 inertial navigation system, AN/ASN-190 navigation Doppler radar, and the AN/APQ-126 terrain-following radar. This version was equipped with two Colt Mk 12 cannon that originally were used by the USN's A-7A and was capable of using newer missiles and bombs due to its modern avionics and sensors. All aircraft retained their in-flight refueling systems, making the A-7 the first aircraft operated by the PoAF with this capability.|$|E

The terrain-following and terrain-avoidance radar, forward looking infrared sensor, inertial navigation system with Global Positioning System, along with a <b>projected</b> <b>map</b> <b>display</b> enable the crew to follow terrain contours and avoid obstacles, making low-level penetration possible.|$|E

5000|$|Viégas is {{also known}} for her artistic work, which explores the medium of {{visualization}} for explorations of emotionally charged digital data. An early example is Artifacts of the Presence Era, an interactive installation at the Boston Center for the Arts in 2003, which featured a video-based timeline of visitor interactions with the museum. She often works with Martin Wattenburg to visualize emotionally charged information. An example of these works is their piece [...] "Web Seer", which is a visualization of gole suggest. The Fleshmap series (started in 2008) uses visualization to portray aspects of sensuality, and includes work on the web, video, and installations. In 2012, she launched the Wind <b>Map</b> <b>project,</b> which <b>displays</b> continuously updated forecasts of wind patterns across the United States.|$|R

50|$|The {{aircraft}} was fitted with an AN/APQ-116 radar, later {{followed by the}} AN/APQ-126, which was integrated into the ILAAS digital navigation system. The radar also fed a digital weapons computer which made possible accurate delivery of bombs from a greater stand-off distance, greatly improving survivability compared with faster platforms such as the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. It was the first U.S. aircraft to have a modern head-up display, (made by Marconi-Elliott), now a standard instrument which displayed information such as dive angle, airspeed, altitude, drift and aiming reticle. The integrated navigation system allowed for another innovation - the <b>projected</b> <b>map</b> <b>display</b> system (PMDS) which accurately showed aircraft position on two different map scales.|$|E
5000|$|The A-7 {{offered a}} plethora of {{cutting-edge}} avionics compared to contemporary aircraft. This included data link capabilities that, among other features, provided fully [...] "hands-off" [...] carrier landing capability when {{used in conjunction with}} its approach power compensator (APC) or auto throttle. Other notable and highly advanced equipment was a <b>projected</b> <b>map</b> <b>display</b> located just below the radar scope. The map display was slaved to the inertial navigation system and provided a high-resolution map image of the aircraft's position superimposed over TPC/JNC charts. Moreover, when slaved to the all-axis auto pilot, the inertial navigation system could fly the aircraft [...] "hands off" [...] to up to nine individual waypoints. Typical inertial drift was minimal for newly manufactured models and the inertial measurement system accepted fly over, radar, and TACAN updates.|$|E

50|$|All {{navigation}} data in an NDS database belongs a specific building block. Each building block addresses specific functional aspects of navigation, such as names for location input, routing, or <b>map</b> <b>display.</b> To cover specific use cases, navigation systems and applications {{may be required}} to filter and aggregate data from different building blocks, e.g. from both Routing and <b>Map</b> <b>Display</b> in order to calculate a route and show it to the user.Each update region may contain data from multiple building blocks. Within a product database, which has several update regions, there may thus be several instances of the same building block. Example: In a Europe product database, there may be a Basic <b>Map</b> <b>Display</b> building block in the update region “France” and a Basic <b>Map</b> <b>Display</b> building block in the update region “Germany”.|$|R

50|$|A moving <b>map</b> <b>display</b> {{is a type}} of {{navigation}} system output that, instead of numerically displaying the current geographical coordinates determined by the navigation unit or an heading and distance indication of a certain waypoint, displays the unit's current location {{at the center of a}} map. As the unit moves around and new coordinates are therefore determined, the map moves to keep its position at the center of the <b>display.</b> Mechanical moving <b>map</b> <b>displays</b> using paper charts were first introduced in the 1950s, and became common in some roles during the 1960s. Mechanically moved paper maps were replaced by digital maps during the 1970s and 80s, with resolution and detail improving along with computer imagery and the computer memory systems that held the data. A common example of a moving <b>map</b> <b>display</b> today is the <b>map</b> <b>display</b> in a smart phone, which uses GPS to determine its current position and then recalls the map data from the device's memory or from the Internet in real time.|$|R
