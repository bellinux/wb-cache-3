5|$|A {{number of}} songs written by Mendelssohn's sister Fanny {{originally}} appeared under her brother's name; {{this may have}} been <b>partly</b> due to the prejudice of the family, and <b>partly</b> to her own retiring nature.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{development}} of the linen industry, Ireland was largely passed over by the industrial revolution, <b>partly</b> because it lacked coal and iron resources and <b>partly</b> because {{of the impact of the}} sudden union with the structurally superior economy of England, which saw Ireland as a source of agricultural produce and capital.|$|E
5|$|For Christmas {{the same}} year, Bach {{performed}} his Magnificat with four inserted , songs of praise related to Christmas, <b>partly</b> in German, <b>partly</b> in Latin. In a vespers service on 25 December 1723, he performed the cantata , and the Magnificat at the , on 26 December the cantata , in the Thomaskirche.|$|E
5|$|The League and {{the ideas}} of {{collective}} security {{and the rule of}} law were defeated; <b>partly</b> because of indifference and of sympathy with the aggressor, but <b>partly</b> because the League powers were unprepared, preoccupied with other matters, and too slow to perceive the scale of Japanese ambitions.|$|E
5|$|The {{orbits of}} Solar System planets are nearly circular. Compared to other systems, they have smaller orbital eccentricity. Although there are {{attempts}} {{to explain it}} <b>partly</b> with a bias in the radial-velocity detection method and <b>partly</b> with long interactions of a quite high number of planets, the exact causes remain undetermined.|$|E
5|$|A {{relatively}} {{small proportion of}} total membership comes from Canada. A growing portion of the Canadian demographic {{is made up of}} immigrant members of the church. This is <b>partly</b> the result of Canadian demographics as a whole, and <b>partly</b> due to decreased interest amongst late generation Canadians. The largest concentration of active congregations in Canada are in Southern Ontario, with notable congregations gathering in Beamsville, Bramalea, Niagara Falls, Vineland, Toronto (several), and Waterloo. Although many congregations of various sizes (typically under 300 members) meet all across Canada.|$|E
5|$|A severe {{regression}} {{would have}} greatly reduced the continental shelf area, {{which is the}} most species-rich part of the sea, and therefore could have been enough to cause a marine mass extinction, however, research concludes that this change would have been insufficient to cause the observed level of ammonite extinction. The regression would also have caused climate changes, <b>partly</b> by disrupting winds and ocean currents and <b>partly</b> by reducing the Earth's albedo and therefore, increasing global temperatures.|$|E
5|$|After graduating, Synge {{decided that}} he wanted to be a {{professional}} musician and went to Germany to study music. He stayed in Coblenz during 1893 and moved to Würzburg in January 1894. <b>Partly</b> because he was shy about performing in public, and <b>partly</b> because of doubt about his ability, he decided to abandon music and pursue his literary interests. He returned to Ireland in June 1894, and moved to Paris in January 1895 to study literature and languages at the Sorbonne.|$|E
5|$|Although {{earmarked}} for operations against the Soviet Union, Luftflotte 2 {{remained in the}} west until May 1941. This was <b>partly</b> as a deception measure, and <b>partly</b> because new airbases in Poland could not be completed by 1 June 1941 target date, although they were made ready {{in time for the}} actual commencement of Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941. Kesselring established his new headquarters at Bielany, a suburb of Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|Before Glöckner's 2003 {{article on}} the origin of the Magnificat, and for some authors still after that, it was {{generally}} assumed that Bach had composed his Magnificat in the quiet time of Advent 1723 for a first performance at the Christmas vespers. For that performance Bach composed four laudes, songs of praise <b>partly</b> in German, <b>partly</b> in Latin to be inserted at certain points in the E-flat major version of the Magnificat. The E-flat major version of the Magnificat including these interpolations is known as BWV 243a.|$|E
5|$|By the 1990s {{maintenance}} of the Drapers Hall, which was <b>partly</b> rented out for residential use, was becoming a drain on the charity's resources.|$|E
5|$|Dennis Lehane's novel The Given Day is <b>partly</b> set {{during the}} Boston police strike.|$|E
5|$|Denver's {{automotive}} beltway {{does not}} include a component in the northwest sector, <b>partly</b> due to concerns over unremediated plutonium contamination.|$|E
5|$|During its {{operational}} lifetime, the rig {{was actively}} in operation for 93% of its working life (2,896 of 3,131 days). The remainder <b>partly</b> relates to time spent between sites.|$|E
5|$|Earwax is <b>partly</b> {{composed}} of sebum produced by glands {{in the ear}} canal. These secretions are viscous and have a high lipid content, which provides good lubrication.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{biology is}} <b>partly</b> based on paleontology, which uses {{the fossil record}} to answer {{questions}} about the mode and tempo of evolution, and <b>partly</b> on the developments in areas such as population genetics. In the 1980s, developmental biology re-entered evolutionary biology after its initial exclusion from the modern synthesis through the study of evolutionary developmental biology. Phylogenetics, systematics, and taxonomy are related fields often considered part of evolutionary biology.|$|E
5|$|French Sudan {{originally}} {{formed as}} a set of military outposts {{as an extension of the}} French colony in Senegal. Though the area offered France little economic or strategic gain, the military effectively advocated greater conquest in the region. This was <b>partly</b> due to a fascination with the great empires, such as the Mali Empire and the Songhay Empire that rose to prominence in the area, and <b>partly</b> due to the promotional opportunities that military conquest offered for French military personnel.|$|E
5|$|From the 6th {{century the}} easternmost South Slavs {{gradually}} {{settled in the}} region, assimilating the <b>partly</b> Hellenised or Romanised Thracians.|$|E
5|$|He has {{revealed}} that his personal distaste for the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats party is based on his <b>partly</b> African ancestry.|$|E
5|$|Helmholtz {{explained}} why the oscillation decayed {{but he had}} not {{explained why}} it occurred in the first place. This was left to Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) who, in 1853, postulated that there was inductance present in the circuit as well as the capacitance of the jar and the resistance of the load. This established the physical basis for the phenomenon - the energy supplied by the jar was <b>partly</b> dissipated in the load but also <b>partly</b> stored in the magnetic field of the inductor.|$|E
5|$|Horses have a {{great sense}} of balance, due <b>partly</b> to their ability to feel their footing and <b>partly</b> to highly {{developed}} proprioception—the unconscious sense of where the body and limbs are at all times. A horse's sense of touch is well developed. The most sensitive areas are around the eyes, ears, and nose. Horses are able to sense contact as subtle as an insect landing anywhere on the body.|$|E
5|$|However, Heghnar Zeitlian Watenpaugh has presumed Sha'arawi's {{description}} to be <b>partly</b> apocryphal.|$|E
5|$|Ian Fleming's 1966 {{short story}} {{collection}} Octopussy and The Living Daylights, and the 1983 James Bond film were <b>partly</b> inspired by Hugo's book.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, Brulé {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} that an adverse relationship with his father may have been at least <b>partly</b> to blame for his floundering NHL career.|$|E
5|$|In Wales a {{disaster}} fund of £4,575,000 was <b>partly</b> allocated to assist farmers who lost about 4 million sheep.|$|E
5|$|In {{the great}} {{majority}} of cells, smooth ER regions are scarce and are often <b>partly</b> smooth and <b>partly</b> rough. They are sometimes called transitional ER because they contain ER exit sites from which transport vesicles carrying newly synthesized proteins and lipids bud off for transport to the Golgi apparatus. In certain specialized cells, however, the smooth ER is abundant and has additional functions. The smooth ER of these specialized cells functions in diverse metabolic processes, including synthesis of lipids, metabolism of carbohydrates, and detoxification of drugs and poisons.|$|E
5|$|Leith {{spent seven}} months of {{recording}} and writing and worked with Bryon Jones, James Roche and Ross Fraser. Initially, he wanted the album {{to be released in}} March, but it was pushed back to August, <b>partly</b> due to the prolonged success of The Winner's Journey and <b>partly</b> because of the large amount of songs they had to cull.|$|E
5|$|Neon is {{the second}} lightest inert gas. Neon has three stable isotopes: 20Ne (90.48%), 21Ne (0.27%) and 22Ne (9.25%). 21Ne and 22Ne are <b>partly</b> {{primordial}} and <b>partly</b> nucleogenic (i.e. made by nuclear reactions of other nuclides with neutrons or other particles in the environment) and their variations in natural abundance are well understood. In contrast, 20Ne (the chief primordial isotope made in stellar nucleosynthesis) is not known to be nucleogenic or radiogenic. The causes of the variation of 20Ne in the Earth have thus been hotly debated.|$|E
5|$|None of {{the three}} telescopes was constructed, {{although}} several design {{studies were carried out}} and some scale models were made. This was <b>partly</b> due to the changing political climate over the time (the period was from a Labour Party government under Harold Wilson to a Conservative Party one under Margaret Thatcher), and <b>partly</b> to the financial constraints of astronomical research in the UK at the time. Also, at a vital time, it became necessary to upgrade the Lovell Telescope to the Mark IA, which subsequently overran in terms of cost.|$|E
5|$|Only Rensselaerswyck was a {{successful}} patroonship. Van Rensselaer successively purchased Godyn's share in the patroonship from his heirs, so that van Rensselaer soon became the owner of three-fifths. The two other shares remained <b>partly</b> {{in the hands of}} Blommaert and <b>partly</b> in the hands of others: Adam Bessels owning Blommaert's fifth, while Johannes de Laet and Toussaint Muyssaert split Burgh's fifth between them.|$|E
5|$|Other {{influences}} {{exerted by}} Lem's works include Will Wright's popular city planning game SimCity, which was <b>partly</b> inspired by Lem's short story The Seventh Sally.|$|E
5|$|<b>Partly</b> {{because of}} {{theoretical}} and mathematical difficulties and <b>partly</b> {{because of the}} extremely high energies (beyond what is technologically possible for the foreseeable future) needed to test these theories experimentally, there is so far no experimental evidence that would unambiguously point {{to any of these}} models being a correct fundamental description of nature. This has led some in the community to criticize these approaches to unification and question the value of continued research on these problems.|$|E
5|$|<b>Partly</b> owned {{companies}} include Kenya Airfreight Handling Limited, {{dedicated to}} the cargo handling of perishable goods (51%-owned) and Tanzanian carrier Precision Air (41.23%-owned).|$|E
5|$|Pilcher {{had married}} Kathleen Gonne, {{daughter}} of a cavalry officer, in 1889; the marriage was strained, <b>partly</b> through Pilcher's gambling habits and adultery, and <b>partly</b> through his dislike for Maud Gonne, Kathleen's sister and a prominent Irish nationalist. The couple divorced in 1911, having had four children; one would later become a High Court judge, while another died on the Western Front in 1915. Pilcher remarried in 1913, and remained married to his second wife Millicent {{until his death in}} 1928.|$|E
5|$|She {{was sent}} to a convent after her {{education}} in Manila. The convent she was studying in was the Santa Catalina College of the Dominican nuns, an exclusive school for girls, established in the Walled City of Intramuros where she finished her elementary and secondary education. In college, she learned Spanish, music, the feminine crafts and social graces. She spent her girlhood <b>partly</b> in their hometown and <b>partly</b> in the convent. Accordingly, Agoncillo was skilled in needlework.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{things happen}} in other brain areas: an initial {{synaptic}} matrix is generated {{as a result of}} genetically determined chemical guidance, but then gradually refined by activity-dependent mechanisms, <b>partly</b> driven by internal dynamics, <b>partly</b> by external sensory inputs. In some cases, as with the retina-midbrain system, activity patterns depend on mechanisms that operate only in the developing brain, and apparently exist solely to guide development.|$|E
