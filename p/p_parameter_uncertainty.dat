40|$|Overall {{persistence}} (P OV) and long-range transport potential (LRTP) {{of chemicals}} are two indicators {{used in the}} context of precautionary chemical assessment. Multimedia fate models are used in research and regulatory contexts to calculate numerical indicators of P OV and LRTP. The resulting indicator values exhibit uncertainty due to model uncertainty concerning model design and due to variability and uncertainty in the substance parameters. In this study, we compare the relative magnitude of substance <b>parameter</b> and model <b>uncertainty</b> for a large set of 3175 hypothetical chemicals that evenly cover the chemical parameter space and for eight different multimedia models available for the calculation of P OV and LRTP. The assessment of the relative magnitude of the two types of uncertainty is important to direct further research and to inform the user on the level of confidence he can have in the model results. It is shown that, for <b>P</b> OV, substance <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainty</b> is larger than model uncertainty in most cases (78 %), and that model uncertainty becomes more important for those chemicals which partition in considerable amounts into more than one environmental compartment. For LRTP, on the other hand, model uncertainty is higher than <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainty</b> in most cases (61 - 81 %). This dominance of model uncertainty can be explained with known differences in the model designs. Uncertainty of P OV can thus be reduced most effectively by improving data on degradation rate constants. For LRTP, the choice of the model that is best suited for the assessment purpose in question is most essential to reduce uncertainty...|$|R

Using a VAR {{model of the}} UK economy and an assumed quadratic loss function for the policy-maker, an optimal interest rate rule is calculated first ignoring <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainty,</b> then assuming that the <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainty</b> is given by the estimated standard errors on the VAR coefficients. These rules are compared with the estimated interest rate equation from the VAR. The optimal rule accounting for <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainty</b> results in a less aggressive path for official interest rates than when <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainty</b> is ignored. However, the estimates of <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainty</b> are not so large that the optimal rule matches all {{the characteristics of the}} actual path of official rates. ...|$|R

This paper aims to integrate <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainty</b> into simulations {{of climate change}} impacts on forest net primary productivity (NPP).

We analytically characterize the expected loss of a multiperiod investor, and we find that it {{is equal to the}} product of two terms. The first term corresponds with the single-period utility loss in the absence of transaction costs, as characterized by Kan and Zhou (2007), whereas the second term captures the multiperiod effects on the overall utility loss. To mitigate {{the impact of}} <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainty,</b> we propose two multiperiod shrinkage portfolios. The first multiperiod shrinkage portfolio combines the Markowitz portfolio with a target portfolio. This method diversifies the effects of <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainty</b> and reduces the risk of taking inefficient positions. The second multiperiod portfolio shrinks the investor's trading rate.

The CRC for Catchment Hydrology has produced a toolkit product SCL to generate rainfall and climate data but all the models in SCL except the annual rainfall model do not take into account <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainty.</b> One of the objectives of the eWater CRC is to incorporate <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainty</b> in stochastic models. The source of <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainty</b> is insufficient sample size in calibration and is equally applicable to parametric and nonparametric models. The traditional way of incorporating <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainty</b> is via Bayesian analysis using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. This technique requires formulation of a likelihood function which is not straightforward for all the models in SCL. Therefore, a simple resampling method is investigated to incorporate <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainty</b> in both parametric and nonparametric models. The model is applied to generate annual rainfall data at 10 Australian rainfall stations and the results are compared with those from the SCL. Also, the method is evaluated for different record lengths by applying to Melbourne data with different data lengths. The comparison shows that the resampling method adequately describes the effect of <b>parameter</b> <b>uncertainty</b> in most tested statistics for record lengths of the order of 50 years or more.
