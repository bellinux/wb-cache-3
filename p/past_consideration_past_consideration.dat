50|$|Generally, <b>past</b> <b>{{consideration}}</b> {{is not a}} {{valid consideration}} and has no legal value. <b>Past</b> <b>consideration</b> is consideration that has already flowed from the promisee to the promisor. That is, the promisee's act or forbearance predates the promisor's promise. <b>Past</b> <b>consideration</b> therefore cannot {{be used as a}} basis when claiming damages.|$|R
5000|$|... "It may {{be taken}} as a general rule, subject to {{exceptions}} not applicable to this case, that the promise must be coextensive with the <b>consideration...</b> a <b>consideration</b> <b>past</b> and executed will support no other promise than such as would be implied by law." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{rule that}} <b>past</b> <b>{{consideration}}</b> {{is not good}} consideration {{is subject to the}} exception discussed by the Privy Council in Pao On v Lau Yiu Long. In that case, their Lordships held that <b>past</b> <b>consideration</b> can be good consideration where: ...|$|R
50|$|Generally <b>past</b> <b>consideration</b> is not {{sufficient}} <b>consideration</b> but a <b>past</b> service performed {{at the request of}} the promisor with an implication they will be paid for is sufficient consideration for a subsequent promise to pay for them.|$|R
40|$|It is trite {{law that}} a valid and {{enforceable}} contract must {{be supported by}} consideration. The recent Court of Appeal case of Rainforest Trading Ltd v State Bank of India Singapore [2012] 2 SLR 713 is a further addition to the local jurisprudence on <b>consideration,</b> specifically the issue of <b>past</b> <b>consideration.</b> This note considers the specific issue of <b>past</b> <b>consideration</b> and argues that its label should be discarded in favour of a more realistic one that correctly emphasises its underlying concerns...|$|R

2500|$|However, {{consideration}} must {{be given}} as part of entering the contract, not prior [...] as in <b>past</b> <b>consideration.</b> For example, in the early English case of Eastwood v. Kenyon , the guardian [...] {{of a young girl}} took out a loan to educate her. After she was married, her husband promised to pay the debt but the loan was determined to be <b>past</b> <b>consideration.</b> The insufficiency of <b>past</b> <b>consideration</b> is related to the preexisting duty rule. In the early English case of Stilk v. Myrick , a captain promised to divide the wages of two deserters among the remaining crew if they agreed to sail home short-handed; however, this promise was found unenforceable as the crew were already contracted to sail the ship. The preexisting duty rule also extends to general legal duties; for example, a promise to refrain from committing a tort or crime is not sufficient.|$|R

5000|$|Lord Scarman, {{giving the}} Privy Council’s advice first {{disposed}} {{of the question}} about <b>past</b> <b>consideration,</b> because a promise to perform a pre-existing contractual obligation to a third party can be good consideration. The question of whether consideration can be invalidated ‘if {{there has been a}} threat to repudiate a pre-existing contractual obligation or an unfair use of a dominating bargaining position’ was rejected because ‘where businessmen are negotiating at arm’s length it is unnecessary for the achievement of justice’. On the idea of <b>past</b> <b>consideration,</b> Lord Scarman said this: ...|$|R
50|$|On September 9, 1982, he {{was signed}} by the Cleveland Browns as a free agent. He was traded the Chicago Bears on April 28, 1983, in {{exchange}} for <b>past</b> <b>considerations.</b>|$|R
50|$|He {{was traded}} to the Dallas Desperados for <b>past</b> <b>considerations</b> on February 17, 2006. He played for the Dragons from 2006 to 2008, earning Second Team All-Arena honors in 2007.|$|R
50|$|<b>Past</b> <b>consideration</b> is not valid. Something that {{is already}} done is done, {{and it does not}} change the legal {{position}} of the promisor. Any goods or services to be exchanged must be exchanged at or after the time of contract formation.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Consideration</b> may be <b>past,</b> {{present or}} future. <b>Past</b> <b>{{consideration}}</b> is not consideration according to English law. However it is a consideration as per Indian law. Example of <b>past</b> <b>consideration</b> is, [...] "A" [...] renders some service to [...] "B" [...] at latter's desire. After a month [...] "B" [...] promises to compensate [...] "A" [...] for service rendered to him earlier. When consideration is given simultaneously with promise, {{it is said}} to be present consideration [...]. For example, [...] "A" [...] receives Rs.50/- in return for which he promises to deliver certain goods to [...] "B". The money [...] "A" [...] receives is the present consideration. When consideration to one party to other is to pass subsequently to the maker of the contract, is said to be future consideration. For example. [...] "A" [...] promises to deliver certain goods to [...] "B" [...] after a week. [...] "B" [...] promises to pay the price after a fortnight, such consideration is future.|$|R

He was the fourth-string running back and appeared in 11 games. On May 10, 1994, he {{was traded to the}} Los Angeles Raiders in exchange for <b>past</b> <b>considerations.</b>|$|R
50|$|The next year, {{he was the}} team's fourth wide receiver, {{appearing}} in 10 games and being declared inactive in 6. He played primarily on special teams, {{as part of a}} team that won Super Bowl XXXII. On August 30, 1998, he was traded to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for <b>past</b> <b>considerations.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Consideration is {{executory}} when {{a promise}} {{to do something in}} the future is given in exchange for another promise {{to be done in the}} future. Consideration is executed when a promise is actually executed, in exchange for another promise to be executed in the future. <b>Consideration</b> is <b>past</b> when a promise has been given or executed before and independently of the other promise. For example, I promised to take you to lunch, and then when we got there I said [...] "you must pay, because I have given you the benefit of my company". This is <b>past</b> <b>consideration</b> and therefore NO consideration.|$|R
50|$|A promise {{cannot be}} based upon {{consideration}} that was said, given or done before the promise was performed. Something said afterwards, will not count as consideration. For example, if X promises to reward Y for an act that Y had already performed then while the performance of that act is good consideration, for the promise to be rewarded for it is <b>past</b> <b>consideration</b> and therefore not good consideration.|$|R
50|$|In Eastwood v Kenyon the {{guardian}} {{of a young girl}} raised a loan to educate the girl and to improve her marriage prospects. After her marriage, her husband promised to pay off the loan. It was held that {{the guardian}} could not enforce the promise as taking out the loan to raise and educate the girl was <b>past</b> <b>consideration,</b> because it was completed before the husband promised to repay it.|$|R
50|$|Consideration is {{something}} of value given by a promissor to a promisee in exchange for something of value given by a promisee to a promissor. Typical examples of things of value are acts, forbearances, and/or promises to do so. The latter referring to those things that a party has a legal privilege {{to do in the}} first place. So, promising to refrain from committing a tort or crime is not a thing of value for purposes of consideration. This is known as the bargain theory of consideration and requires that the promises to exchange the things be reciprocally induced. This is especially important for the discussion of <b>past</b> <b>consideration,</b> below.|$|R
50|$|Pillans & Rose were in {{business}} together as merchant bankers in Rotterdam. They agreed to accept bills from White, an Irish merchant, on one condition. White {{had to make}} sure Van Mierop & Hopkins, a big London firm, would guarantee the bills. Van Mierop confirmed that they would do so and would guarantee a pre-existing duty of White to pay Pillans. However, before the bills were drawn on Van Mierop, White went insolvent. Van Mierop refused to honour the bills and argued that Pillans had not provided consideration for their guarantee since there was the rule that <b>past</b> <b>consideration</b> is not a good consideration.|$|R
5000|$|On March 1st, 1938, {{prior to}} the {{printing}} of {{the first issue of}} Action Comics, Detective Comics wrote to the plaintiff Siegel at Cleveland, Ohio where he and Shuster both resided, enclosing a check in the sum of $130.00 in payment of the first thirteen pages of Superman strip at the agreed rate of $10.00 per page, {{and at the same time}} a written agreement was enclosed for the plaintiffs' signatures....It is quite apparent that the $130.00 which is the recited consideration in said instrument was already due and owing the plaintiffs before the instrument was executed.

40|$|<b>Past</b> <b>considerations</b> of kin {{selection}} {{have assumed}} a dyadic fitness exchange relationship between altruist and recipient. This approach {{does not account}} for all alleles affected by altruistic behavior. This can be corrected by focusing on matings rather than on individuals. I present a model that tries to account for fitness changes resulting from altruistic acts, not only for the altruist and recipient but also for their spouses, in an evolving population. Results from this model indicate that Hamilton’s rule fails to predict when the altruism allele will increase in frequency and, more important, suggest that kin selection can, at most, account for low levels of a gene for altruism but only if fairly extreme conditions are met...|$|R
40|$|The most {{difficult}} {{and most important}} considerations in planning the protocol of a case-control study are ascertainment of cases, selection of controls {{and the quality of}} the exposure measurement. Plans to ensure careful field work are equally important; without attention to data collection, the protocol will be meaningless. In most case-control studies, the measurement problem is magnified because one cannot implement the collection of exposure information at the beginning of follow-up, and instead must rely on interviews, existing records or extrapolation into the <b>past.</b> <b>Consideration</b> of a case-control study as an efficient way to study a cohort helps to resolve some design issues.

40|$|This {{project is}} a practice-based {{exploration}} of how {{a work of art}} emerges from within a field of signs that are givens brought to the art-making process. In particular it explores the use of utilitarian objects as sculptural materials, where the given signs relate mostly to their past utility. The art-making process then involves a clearing of such givens so that new modes of signification can emerge, as sculptural works of art. Here, the process of making is simultaneously the process of clearing. Various strategies for using these materials are explored, including means to rupture or attenuate associations that objects hold (that we hold for them) with the <b>past.</b> <b>Consideration</b> is given to how, through such means, fresh possibilities might emerge from any material used in the work of art...|$|R

40|$|Primarily {{motivated}} by the drug development process, several publications have now presented methodology {{for the design of}} multi-arm multi-stage experiments with normally distributed outcome variables of known variance. Here, we extend these <b>past</b> <b>considerations</b> to allow the design of what we refer to as an abcd multi-arm multi-stage experiment. We provide a proof of how strong control of the a-generalised type-I familywise error-rate can be ensured. We then describe how to attain the power to reject at least b out of c false hypotheses, which is related to controlling the b-generalised type-II familywise error-rate. Following this, we detail how a design can be optimised for a scenario in which rejection of any d null hypotheses brings about termination of the experiment. We achieve this by proposing a highly computationally efficient approach for evaluating the performance of a candidate design. Finally, using a real clinical trial as a motivating example, we explore the effect of the design's control parameters on the statistical operating characteristics...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the activities initiated {{to improve the}} existing spray gun system used for spraying insulating foam on the External Tank of the Space Shuttle, due to the quality variations of the applied foam noted in the <b>past.</b> <b>Consideration</b> {{is given to the}} two tasks of the project: (1) investigations of possible improvements, as an interim measure, to the spray gun currently used to apply the large acreage spray-on-foam insulation and the evaluation of other commercial equipment; and (2) the design and fabrication of a new automatic spray gun. The design and operation of the currently used Binks 43 PA spray gun are described together with several new breadboard spray guns designed and fabricated and the testing procedures developed. These new guns include the Modular Automatic Foam spray gun, the Ball Valve spray gun, and the Tapered Plug Valve (TPV) gun. As a result of tests, the TPV spray gun is recommended to replace the currently used automatic spray gun...|$|R
