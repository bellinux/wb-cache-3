40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} Manix®, the commonly used polyherbal formulation on <b>pefloxacin</b> pharmacokinetic parameters. Methods: Microbiological assay was employed using clinical isolate of Escherichia coli samples from hospitalized patients. Results: Manix® altered the bioavailability parameters of <b>pefloxacin</b> as thus, maximal concentration (Cmax) of <b>pefloxacin</b> (0. 91 ± 0. 31) μg/mL occurred at time to reach maximal concentration (tmax) 4. 0 h while in the group that received Manix® alongside <b>pefloxacin</b> Cmax was (0. 22 ± 0. 08) μg/mL at tmax 1. 0 h respectively. The area under curve of <b>pefloxacin</b> alone was (7. 83 ± 5. 14) μg/h/mL while with Manix® was (2. 60 ± 0. 08) μg/h/mL. There {{was a significant difference}} between Cmax, tmax and area under curve between <b>pefloxacin</b> alone and <b>pefloxacin</b> after Manix® pre-treatment (P< 0. 05).

40|$|In vivo {{microdialysis}} with HPLC {{was used}} to investigate the pharmacokinetics of <b>pefloxacin</b> and its interaction with cyclosporin A. Microdialysis probes were inserted into the jugular vein/right atrium, the striatum and the bile duct of male Sprague-Dawley rats. Biological fluid sampling thereby allowed the simultaneous determination of <b>pefloxacin</b> levels in blood, brain and bile. Following <b>pefloxacin</b> administration, the brain-to-blood coefficient of distribution was 0. 036. This was calculated by dividing the area under the concentration curve (AUC) of <b>pefloxacin</b> in brain by its AUC in blood (k=AUCbrain/AUCblood). When the P-glycoprotein cyclosporin A (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) was co-administered with <b>pefloxacin</b> (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1), the AUC and the mean residence time in rat blood {{did not differ significantly}} (P> 0. 05). Similarly, the pharmacokinetics of <b>pefloxacin</b> in rat brain was not affected by the presence of cyclosporin A. The AUC of unbound <b>pefloxacin</b> in bile was significantly greater than that in blood. The disposition of <b>pefloxacin</b> in rat bile shows a slow elimination phase following a peak concentration 30 [*]min after <b>pefloxacin</b> administration (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.). The bile-to-blood coefficient of distribution (k=AUCbile/AUCblood) was 1. 53.

40|$|Soft tissue {{infections in}} {{compromised}} patients are frequently caused by Gram-negative organisms and particularly by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These pathogens are effectively eradicated by <b>pefloxacin</b> {{as well as}} by ceftazidime. The effectiveness and safety of these two agents were compared in a prospective randomized study in 67 patients with soft tissue infections. Underlying conditions included malignant diseases, diabetes mcllitus and chronic renal failure. The infections included: post operative infection, septic foot, soft tissue abscess ' and cellulitis. Thirty-three patients were treated with intravenous ceftazidime for a mean duration of ten days. More than half the 34 patients given <b>pefloxacin</b> were treated only orally for a mean period of 13 days. The clinical and bacteriological outcomes were similar in both groups. There was clinical cure or improvement in 26 <b>pefloxacin</b> cases and in 23 ceftazidime cases, failure in six <b>pefloxacin</b> cases and in seven ceftazidime and relapse in two <b>pefloxacin</b> and in three ceftazidime patients. The bacteriological responses were eradication in 23 <b>pefloxacin</b> cases and in 22 ceftazidime cases, persistence in five <b>pefloxacin</b> cases and in six ceftazidime cases, relapse in one <b>pefloxacin</b> case and in none of the ceftazidime group, reinfection in four <b>pefloxacin</b> cases and in three ceftazidime cases and there was one unassessed patient in the <b>pefloxacin</b> group and two in the ceftazidime group. Nausea and vomiting occurred in three patients and elevation of liver enzymes in another patient; all side effects were observed only in the <b>pefloxacin</b> treated patients. These results suggest that oral <b>pefloxacin</b> could offer an alternative to intravenous ceftazidime in half the compromised patients with tissue infections.

40|$|MICs of <b>pefloxacin</b> {{and nine}} antistaphylococcal drugs were {{determined}} for 200 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus hominis, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. All the strains were susceptible to <b>pefloxacin,</b> vancomycin, and rifampin. Oxacillin-resistant strains were uniformly resistant to cephalothin {{and were more}} likely to be resistant to gentamicin, erythromycin, clindamycin, doxycycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole than were oxacillin-susceptible strains. Time-kill studies with 23 strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. haemolyticus indicated that the relative order of bactericidal activities was gentamicin greater than or equal to <b>pefloxacin</b> greater than oxacillin greater than vancomycin greater than rifampin. <b>Pefloxacin</b> combined with oxacillin or vancomycin killed staphylococci more rapidly than oxacillin or vancomycin alone but less rapidly than <b>pefloxacin</b> alone.

40|$|Background- In {{urinary tract}} {{infection}} (UTI) alkalinisation of urine is a common practice, which may change or altered the effect of some antimicrobial treatment. <b>Pefloxacin,</b> a well-known fluoroquinolone used for treatment of {{urinary tract infection}} {{is found to be}} effective. On this background, the study was done to evaluate the effect of <b>pefloxacin</b> in presence of alkalinising agent.

40|$|The {{effects of}} an antacid {{containing}} magnesium and aluminum hydroxide on the pharmacokinetics of <b>pefloxacin</b> in 10 healthy volunteers were investigated. In a randomized crossover design, each subject received an oral dose of 400 mg of <b>pefloxacin</b> either with or without multiple doses of the antacid. The concentrations of <b>pefloxacin</b> and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography assays. We found that coadministration of magnesium and aluminum hydroxide caused a decrease of levels of <b>pefloxacin</b> in plasma and urine. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve decreased significantly (P < 0. 001), suggesting impaired absorption of <b>pefloxacin</b> from the gastrointestinal tract. The relative bioavailability of <b>pefloxacin</b> after the antacid treatment was 44. 4 % +/- 23. 8 %, compared with that after a single administration. The underlying mechanism of this drug interaction is the formation of chelate complexes and probably also physical adsorption to the aluminum hydroxide gel. The metabolism of <b>pefloxacin</b> was not altered by the antacid treatment. Renal clearance was found to depend on urinary pH. Terminal half-life was significantly shorter after the antacid treatment, probably because {{of an increase in}} nonrenal clearance.
