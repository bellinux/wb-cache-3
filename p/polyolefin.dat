Then, the number of defects in the polymer chain increases considerably. The particle size distribution of impurities is very wide, the big particles of 60–1000µm—which are visible by naked eye and easy to filter—representing the lesser evil, since their total surface is relatively small and the degradation speed is therefore lower. The influence of the microscopic particles, which—because they are many—increase the frequency of defects in the polymer, is relatively greater.|$|E

The functionalization of preformed <b>polyolefins</b> is a way which has been successfully followed to improve the polymer miscibility. The functionalization of {{linear low density polyethylene}} (LLDPE) and ethylene-propylene copolymers (EP), with diethyl maleate (DEM) and dicumyl peroxide (DCP) as radical initiator, gives products containing up to 2 - 5 mol % of well defined functional groups (2 -diethyl succinate).

2500|$|In 2003 Shaw Industries {{selected}} {{a combination of}} <b>polyolefin</b> resins as the base polymer of choice for EcoWorx due to the low toxicity of its feedstocks, superior adhesion properties, dimensional stability, {{and its ability to}} be recycled.

Polyolefins are compatible with known nylon-6 depolymerization methods. PVC interferes with those processes. Nylon-6 chemistry is well-known and not addressed in first-generation production.
