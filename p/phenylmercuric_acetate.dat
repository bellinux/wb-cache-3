The view {{that this is}} a result of modification of a protein thiol group is re-examined {{in the light of the}} following new observations. (i) After treatment with <b>phenylmercuric</b> <b>acetate,</b> the enzyme's ability to be re-greened by addition of thiols was not decreased by gel filtration or precipitation with (NH 4) 2 SO 4. (ii) <b>Phenylmercuric</b> <b>acetate</b> caused the same extent of de-greening whether added in a few large amounts or many small ones. The overall time taken for de-greening was, however, greatly extended when many small additions were made. (iii) In Tris/acetate buffer, pH 7. 5, 3. 5 mol of phenylmercuric acetate/mol of enzyme subunit was required for complete de-greening, compared with only 2. 5 mol/mol in phosphate buffer, pH 7. (iv) None of the groups that react with <b>phenylmercuric</b> <b>acetate</b> is accessible to iodoacetate or iodoacetamide. (v) On a molar basis dithiothreitol, mercaptoethanol and CoA are equally effective in re-greening the enzyme. (vi) Provided that <b>phenylmercuric</b> <b>acetate</b> is not present in excess, the de-greened enzyme forms normal and stable complexes with crotonyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA. (vii) When a small excess of <b>phenylmercuric</b> <b>acetate</b> is present, full stable development of the enzyme–acetoacetyl-CoA complex requires addition of several mol of acetoacetyl-CoA/mol of enzyme subunit. (viii) The ability of de-greened enzyme to be immediately re-greened by an excess of thiol declines with time, more rapidly at pH 6 than at pH 7 or 8, but at all three pH values the instantaneous re-greening was followed by a slow phase of further increase in A 710. This further recovery was most extensive and most rapid at pH 8. These findings are reminiscent of the previously described reversible decline in the re-greening capacity of a protein-free acid extract of green butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase. It is concluded that the likely cause of de-greening is chemical modification of the tightly bound thioester rather than a protein thiol group. The reversibility would be explained if the thioester exists on the surface of the enzyme in equilibrium with free CoA and a lactone, or if the acyl group is readily and reversibly transferred from the thiol of CoA to a protein side chain...|$|E

It was therefore chosen for a {{comparative study of}} the effect of oxygen status in a single organism upon the activity of conventional metabolic poisons. Inhibitor activity was based upon the concentration required for 50 % inhibition of germination. The inhibitors were: AgNO 3, HgCl 2, <b>phenylmercuric</b> <b>acetate,</b> iodoacetamide, KCN, NaN 3, NaF, fluoroacetate, 2, 4 -dinitrophenol, Na 2 HAsO 4 and CO. Only 5 inhibitors out of 11 differed significantly in their effects on aerobic and anaerobic germination. These included <b>phenylmercuric</b> <b>acetate</b> (N 2), sodium fluoroacetate (air), NaN 3 (air), and 2, 4 -dinitrophenol (N 2). CO activity was manifest only in air and it was photo-reversible. The effects of CO, NaN 3, and fluoroacetate were consistent with their conventional role in aerobic metabolism. The failure of KCN to discriminate was attributed to its relative non-specificity. 2, 4 -Dinitrophenol behaved anomalously, requiring a 20 -fold lower concentration for inhibition under nitrogen than under air. Among sulfhydryl poisons, only <b>phenylmercuric</b> <b>acetate</b> differentiated between germination in air and nitrogen and was nearly 8 times more active under nitrogen.

A fast and parallel rate of uptake of both mercurials in kidney slices between 1 to 3 hour periods was observed. The uptake of the two mercurials into liver slices was much less than that found in kidney slices, The binding rate of <b>phenylmercuric</b> <b>acetate</b> was almost double the rate of inorganic mercury. The subcellular fractions (nuclear, mitochondrial, microsomal, and soluble) of the tissue slices were prepared by homogenizing in 0. 25 molar sucrose with subsequent differential centrifugation. Even though the two mercurials showed similar binding in kidney slices, it was found that <b>phenylmercuric</b> <b>acetate</b> was bound to almost twice the extent that of inorganic mercury in the mitochondria, micro-somal, and soluble fractions, with the preponderate of the inorganic mercury being bound in the nuclear. <b>Phenylmercuric</b> <b>acetate</b> was also bound to twice the extent of inorganic mercury in the mitochondrial, microsomal, and soluble fractions from incubated liver slices; however, the binding of the two mercurials in the liver nuclear fraction was similar during the first hours. Also, there was a decrease of the binding of inorganic mercury in the soluble fraction from incubated liver slices as the incubation time increased. Sephadex G- 100 elution patterns of the soluble protein fractions from incubated kidney and liver slices were determined. The mercury binding patterns in the elution fractions were also determined. There was found to be three main peaks in the elution pattern from liver and kidney soluble proteins. The first peak represents proteins with molecular weights of 100, 000 or greater. The second peak consists of 15, 000 to 30, 000 molecular weight proteins followed by a trough or dip in the pattern representing large polypeptides (molecular weights of 2, 000 to 3, 000). The last peak consists of small polypeptides. The specific binding of <b>phenylmercuric</b> <b>acetate</b> in the proteins of the elution pattern corresponding to a molecular weight of 100, 000 or larger is greater than inorganic mercury by as much as two-fold. The 15, 000 to 30, 000 molecular weight proteins in the Sephadex G- 100 elution patterns show 2. 5 to five times as much specific binding of <b>phenylmercuric</b> <b>acetate</b> as compared to mercuric ion. There was no other area in the patterns in which the mercurials were bound to any significant extent. The binding patterns of the two mercury compounds in the soluble proteins of incubated kidney slices filtered through Sephadex G- 100 columns, were {{similar to those of the}} liver soluble proteins, except for a very high specific binding of both in the region of the elution pattern corresponding to large polypeptides (2, 000 to 3, 000 molecular weight). Sephadex G- 100 filtration of the incubation soluble proteins leached from liver slices indicated that <b>phenylmercuric</b> <b>acetate</b> caused a greater loss of large molecular weight proteins as compared to the control or inorganic mercury incubated slices. The migration characteristics of soluble proteins from kidney slices with and without mercurial treatment were measured by disc electrophorosis on polyacrylamide gel columns. The results indicated that <b>phenylmercuric</b> <b>acetate</b> caused a possible loss of large molecular weight proteins from the soluble fraction as compared to control or inorganic mercury incubated kidney slices. There was found to be no correlation between the specific binding of the two mercurials with the enzymatic activity of alkaline phosphatase in the soluble and microsomal fractions. It was found that kidney slices incubated in solutions of inorganic mercury resulted in approximately 83 percent enhancement of alkaline phosphatase activity in the soluble fraction as compared to control. <b>Phenylmercuric</b> <b>acetate</b> caused about a 40 percent increase. The microsomal fractions from inorganic mercury treated kidney slices showed a greater decrease in the alkaline phosphatase activity than did phenyl-mercuric acetate as compared to that of control. Twenty to 30 percent of the alkaline phosphatase activity of the 35, 000 X G soluble fraction was removed by ultracentrifugation at 150, 000 X G. It is possible that the apparent activation of alkaline phosphatase in the soluble fraction was due to a solubilization of the enzyme, with its genesis possibly being in the microsomes. Addition of <b>phenylmercuric</b> <b>acetate</b> to the reaction mixture at concentrations up to 10 ⁻³ molar caused no significant decrease in the activity of alkaline phosphatase from kidney soluble proteins, while inorganic mercury showed 20 percent inhibition at 10 ⁻⁵ molar and almost 75 percent inhibition at 5 X 10 ⁻⁵ molar.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the inhibitors {{proflavine}} and <b>phenylmercuric</b> <b>acetate</b> upon germination of conidia of a mutant of Aspergillus nidulans were investigated. Conidia were observed microscopically in the germination process, on media containing various concentrations of the inhibitors. Resistance was induced to gradually increasing concentrations of the inhibitors by continual subculture of the organism in their presence. The effect of this training process upon resistance to the inhibitor, during the various phases of germination and other stages of the asexual life cycle of the organism, were studied at length. [...] The untrained strain of the mutant proved relatively resistant to proflavine, and a small inoculum could grow on petri plates containing concentrations of the inhibitor up to 400 ppm. This strain could be trained to resist concentrations of proflavine up to 475 ppm on petri plates. The principal effects of proflavine on germination were shown to be inhibition of spore swelling, prevention of {{the production of a}} germ tube, and decreased production of mycelium. In growth chambers, strains either trained or untrained to proflavine, germinated almost equally well on concentrations up to 800 ppm, but on 2000 ppm a greater proportion of spores of the resistant strain succeeded in germinating than did those of the untrained strain. [...] Nearness of spores was found to increase the initial germination rate of both strains. The size of conidia of trained and untrained strains just prior to germination was found to be between 7. 1 and 8. 2 μ. The majority of those spores which failed to germinate on 2000 ppm proflavine retained a diameter of less than 4. 4 μ. [...] The mutant had been trained to grow on 0. 50 ppm <b>phenylmercuric</b> <b>acetate</b> in petri plates. In growth chambers (where the inoculum used was much heavier than that added to petri plates) growth of both trained and untrained strains was obtained on 0. 50 ppm. The closeness of spores increased the germination rate. The inhibitor at concentrations higher than 0. 50 ppm completely inhibited the swelling of the spores and other phases of germination. Heavy deposits were seen in the hyphae of both trained and untrained strains growing in the presence of <b>phenylmercuric</b> <b>acetate.</b> These deposits were observed to appear much earlier in the hyphae of the resistant strain than in those of the untrained strain. Hyphal growth was retarded in both strains, and sporulation did not occur in the sensitive strain {{in the presence of the}} drug.

With cell extracts and 203 Hg(NO 3) 2 as the substrate, mercuric reductase (HgRe) activity was demonstrable {{in six of}} eight taxonomic groups. HgRe activity was inducible and required NADPH or NADH and a thiol donor for optimai activity. Species with HgRe activity were also resistant to organomercurial compounds, including <b>phenylmercuric</b> <b>acetate.</b> Attempts at intraspecies and intragenus transfer of HgRe activity by conjugation or transformation were unsuccessful. Mercury resistance is common in rapidly growing mycobacteria and appears to function via the same inducible enzyme systems already defined in other bacterial species. This system offers potential as a strain marker for epidemiologic investigations and for studying genetic systems in rapidly growing mycobacteria...|$|E
40|$|Mercury {{pollution}} {{is a major}} environmental problem that arises {{as a result of}} natural processes as well as from anthropogenic sources. In response to toxic mercury compounds, microbes have developed astonishing array of resistance systems to detoxify them. To address this challenge, this study was aimed in screening bacterial isolates for their tolerance against varied concentrations of <b>phenylmercuric</b> <b>acetate.</b> Mercury transformation by bacteria being sensitive to factors such as available carbon source, etc. that affect mer-mediated transformation, screened mercury tolerant bacteria were also studied for their tolerance to different antimicrobials and carbon sources, followed by identification using biochemical as well as 16 S rRNA approach. Following identification, gene encoding organomercurial lyase catalyzing protonolytic cleavage of C-Hg bond of organic mercury was amplified using gene specific primers, cloned in pGEMT((R)) easy vector and sequenced. Microbe-based approach using organomercurial lyase encoded by merB gene being potentially economic, provides foundation to facilitate genetic manipulation of this environmentally important enzyme to remove high concentrations of obstinate mercury using holistic, multifaceted approach for use in bioremediation through generation of transgenics or as catalyst for use in bioreactors...|$|E
40|$|Methylmercury is an {{environmental}} toxicant that biomagnifies and causes severe neurological degeneration in animals. It {{is produced by}} bacteria in soils and sediments that have been contaminated with mercury. To explore the potential of plants to extract and detoxify this chemical, we engineered a model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, to express a modified bacterial gene, merBpe, encoding organomercurial lyase (MerB) under control of a plant promoter. MerB catalyzes the protonolysis of the carbon—mercury bond, removing the organic ligand and releasing Hg(II), a less mobile mercury species. Transgenic plants expressing merBpe grew vigorously {{on a wide range}} of concentrations of monomethylmercuric chloride and <b>phenylmercuric</b> <b>acetate.</b> Plants lacking the merBpe gene were severely inhibited or died at the same organomercurial concentrations. Six independently isolated transgenic lines produced merBpe mRNA and MerB protein at levels that varied over a 10 - to 15 -fold range, and even the lowest levels of merBpe expression conferred resistance to organomercurials. Our work suggests that native macrophytes (e. g., trees, shrubs, grasses) engineered to express merBpe may be used to degrade methylmercury at polluted sites and sequester Hg(II) for later removal...|$|E
40|$|Removal of {{the green}} colour of butyryl-CoA {{dehydrogenase}} by reagents specific for nucleophilic sulphur is shown to involve chemical modification of the tightly bound CoA persulphide. 5, 5 '-Dithiobis-(2 -nitrobenzoic acid) (Ellman's reagent) de-greens the enzyme essentially irreversibly, with a stoicheiometry of approx. 1 mol/mol of FAD. A compound separated by subsequent gel filtration is eluted at {{the same position as}} a CoA-thionitrobenzoate standard. The 35 S-labelled distal sulphur atom of CoA persulphide is separated from this material. The enzyme remains fully active. <b>Phenylmercuric</b> <b>acetate</b> also de-greens the enzyme. The extent to which thiols restore the green colour declines with time. Gel filtration of mercurial-treated enzyme separates low-Mr material containing a CoA moiety, an extra S atom and a phenylmercury moiety. This material, added to yellow butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase with an excess of thiol, re-forms green enzyme, but it loses this ability on storage. The results are explicable if it is assumed that the thionitrobenzoate derivative of CoA persulphide loses the extra sulphur atom much more readily than does the phenylmercury derivative...|$|E
40|$|M ILLER et al. (1959 a, b, 1967) have {{reported}} that one strain of inbred chicks (R) retained more mercury in the liver and kidneys than another strain (S) following injection of mercuric chloride (MC) or <b>phenylmercuric</b> <b>acetate.</b> These lines were selected for resistance (R) and susceptibility (S) to the avian leukosis complex by Bearse et al. (1963). A tri-amcinolone diacetate (TR) injection of 1. 0 mg. per kg. body weight given 24 hours before MC had been found to in-crease the retention of mercury in the kidneys of the R chicks 96 hours later (Miller et al., 1969). Since mercury was deposited primarily in the kidney, this paper reports {{some aspects of the}} sta-bility of the kidney-mercury complex based on the percentage of the mercury dialyzable against dilute thiomalate (TM) from kidney homogenates of both strains. The effect of preinjection of TR on the percent of dialyzable mercury is also re-ported. METHODS AND MATERIALS Chicks of the R and S strains were raised in wire floored cages and given commerical feed and water ad libitum. Between four and eight weeks of age the...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the present research was to enhance laccase production by Penicillium aculeatum, P. digitatum and P. cyclopium. The effects of different inducers such as guaiacol, caffeic acid, syringaldazine and sinapinic acid were investigated. The procedure developed for laccase purification enabled us to obtain enzymic preparations purified 250, 360 and 400 fold from P. aculeatum, P. digitatum and P. cyclopium, respectively. <b>Phenylmercuric</b> <b>acetate</b> (PMA), 5, 5 -dithiobis (2 -nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) and p-chloromercuribenzoate (PCMB) inhibited the activity of laccase. The inhibition by the three thiol-group reagents supports the idea that cysteinyl residues at the binding sites are important for the enzyme activity. Treatment of laccase with histidine selective reagent, diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) resulted in simple linear pseudo-first-order kinetics. The order of the inactivation kinetics and the protection by the substrate revealed that histidine is at the active site and {{taking part in the}} enzyme activity. The results show that desferal (desferrioxamine mesylate) is an inhibitor of laccase. The inhibitory effect was not dependent {{on the nature of the}} prosthetic group. Its use as an inhibitor of laccase, is promising since desferal seems to deactivate phenoxy radicals formed by the action phenol-oxidizing enzymes...|$|E
