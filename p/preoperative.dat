5|$|Aspirin {{can cause}} {{prolonged}} bleeding after operations {{for up to}} 10 days. In one study, 30 of 6499 people having elective surgery required reoperations to control bleeding. Twenty had diffuse bleeding and 10 had bleeding from a site. Diffuse, but not discrete, bleeding {{was associated with the}} <b>preoperative</b> use of aspirin alone or in combination with other NSAIDS in 19 of the 20 diffuse bleeding people.|$|E
5|$|Research {{is ongoing}} {{on the use}} of metformin, a {{diabetes}} medication, in obese women with endometrial cancer before surgery. Early research has shown it to be effective in slowing the rate of cancer cell proliferation. Preliminary research has shown that <b>preoperative</b> metformin administration can reduce expression of tumor markers. Long-term use of metformin has not been shown to have a preventative effect against developing cancer, but may improve overall survival.|$|E
25|$|Melatonin in {{comparison}} to placebo is effective for reducing <b>preoperative</b> anxiety in adults when given as premedication. It may be just as effective as standard treatment with midazolam in reducing <b>preoperative</b> anxiety. Melatonin may also reduce postoperative anxiety (measured 6 hours after surgery) when compared to placebo.|$|E
25|$|Meningiomas usually can be surgically resected (removed) {{and result}} in a {{permanent}} cure if the tumor is superficial on the dural surface and easily accessible. Transarterial embolization has become a standard <b>preoperative</b> procedure in the <b>preoperative</b> management. If invasion of the adjacent bone occurs, total removal is nearly impossible. It is rare for benign meningiomas to become malignant.|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{impaired}} <b>preoperative</b> cognition had postoperative improvement after surgical decompression of the cyst.|$|E
25|$|Computer-assisted surgery {{techniques}} {{are also available}} to guide the surgeon to provide enhanced accuracy. Several commercial CAS systems are available for use worldwide. HipNav was the first system developed specifically for total hip replacement, and included navigation and <b>preoperative</b> planning based on a <b>preoperative</b> CT scan of the patient. Improved patient outcomes and reduced complications have not been demonstrated when these systems are used when compared to standard techniques.|$|E
25|$|However, it {{has been}} advised that <b>preoperative</b> {{vaccination}} is advisable until the remnant splenic tissue can reestablish its function.|$|E
25|$|Intradural disc {{herniation}} {{is a rare}} form of disc herniation with an {{incidence of}} 0.2-2.2%. <b>Preoperative</b> imaging can be helpful, but intraoperative findings are required to confirm.|$|E
25|$|MRI is the {{investigation}} of choice in the <b>preoperative</b> staging of rectal and prostate cancer and, has {{a role in the}} diagnosis, staging, and follow-up of other tumors.|$|E

25|$|The <b>preoperative</b> {{targeting}} of proper implantation sites {{can be accomplished}} by the indirect and direct methods. The indirect method uses computer tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or ventriculography to locate the anterior and posterior commissures and then employs predetermined coordinates and distances from the intercommissural line to define the target area. Subsequent histologically defined atlas maps {{can also be used to}} verify the target area. The direct method provides visualization and {{targeting of}} deep nuclei by applying stereotactic <b>preoperative</b> MRI, which unlike the indirect method, takes into account the anatomic variation of the nuclei’s size, position, and functional segregation amongst individuals.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{medical record}} for inpatient care can include admission notes, on-service notes, progress notes (SOAP notes), <b>preoperative</b> notes, operative notes, postoperative notes, procedure notes, delivery notes, postpartum notes, and discharge notes.|$|E
25|$|Complications due to LASIK {{have been}} {{classified}} {{as those that}} occur due to <b>preoperative,</b> intraoperative, early postoperative, or late postoperative sources: According to the UK National Health Service complications occur in fewer than 5% of cases.|$|E
25|$|Nalbuphine is {{indicated}} for {{the relief of}} moderate to severe pain. It {{can also be used}} as a supplement to balanced anesthesia, for <b>preoperative</b> and postoperative analgesia, and for obstetrical analgesia during labor and delivery.|$|E
25|$|The {{operation}} typically involves substantial postoperative pain, {{and includes}} vigorous physical rehabilitation. The recovery period may be 6 weeks or longer and may involve {{the use of}} mobility aids (e.g. walking frames, canes, crutches) to enable the patient's return to <b>preoperative</b> mobility.|$|E
25|$|These {{patients}} {{may need to}} be treated operatively because rotator cuff repair is necessary for restoration of the normal strength required to return to the <b>preoperative,</b> competitive level of function. Finally, those who do not respond to, or are unsatisfied with, conservative treatment should seek a surgical opinion.|$|E
25|$|The {{patient may}} want to {{consider}} some basic preparation before the surgery. The most basic preparation is that people who have body hair on the chest {{may want to}} remove the hair by clipping just prior to surgery or using a depilatory agent (<b>preoperative</b> shaving has been on the decline as it can cause skin breakage and increase infection risk of any surgical procedure) as the surgery will involve bandages and monitoring equipment to be affixed to the body.|$|E
25|$|Anemia - {{secondary}} to blood loss, plus the anemia of inflammation, inflammation being inevitable with opening the chest plus harvesting of leg vein(s) for grafting. A {{fall in the}} hemoglobin from normal <b>preoperative</b> levels (e.g. 15) to postoperative levels of 6 to 10 are inevitable. There is no benefit from transfusions until the hemoglobin falls below 7.5. Institutions should establish protocols to ensure transfusions are not given unless the hemoglobin falls below 7.5 without some additional compelling reason(s).|$|E

2500|$|The {{epileptogenic}} zones identified from <b>preoperative</b> EEG {{data were}} validated by observations from postoperative ECoG data {{in all three}} patients. [...] These preliminary results {{suggest that it is}} possible to direct surgical planning and locate epileptogenic zones noninvasively using the described imaging and integrating methods. [...] EEG findings were further validated by the surgical outcomes of all three patients. [...] After surgical resectioning, two patients are seizure-free and the third has experienced a significant reduction in seizures. [...] Due to its clinical success, FINE offers a promising alternative to <b>preoperative</b> ECoG, providing information about both the location and extent of epileptogenic sources through a noninvasive imaging procedure.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, GDV {{has held}} a guarded prognosis. Although [...] "early studies showed {{mortality}} rates between 33% and 68% for dogs with GDV," [...] studies from 2007 to 2012 [...] "reported mortality rates between 10% and 26.8%". Mortality rates approach 10% to 40% even with treatment. A study determined that with prompt treatment and good <b>preoperative</b> stabilization of the patient, mortality is significantly lessened to 10% overall (in a referral setting). Negative prognostic indicators following surgical intervention include postoperative cardiac arrhythmia, splenectomy, or splenectomy with partial gastric resection. Interestingly, {{a longer time}} from presentation to surgery {{was associated with a}} lower mortality, presumably because these dogs had received more complete <b>preoperative</b> fluid resuscitation and were thus better cardiovascularly stabilized prior to the procedure.|$|E
2500|$|Most fibroadenomas {{are simply}} monitored. Some are treated by {{surgical}} excision. They are removed {{with a small}} margin of normal breast tissue if the <b>preoperative</b> clinical investigations are suggestive {{of the necessity of}} this procedure. [...] A small amount of normal tissue must be removed in case the lesion {{turns out to be a}} phyllodes tumour on microscopic examination.|$|E
2500|$|Treatment of Graves' disease {{includes}} antithyroid drugs which {{reduce the}} production of thyroid hormone; radioiodine (radioactive iodine I-131); and thyroidectomy (surgical excision of the gland). As operating on a frankly hyperthyroid patient is dangerous, prior to thyroidectomy, <b>preoperative</b> treatment with antithyroid drugs is given to render the patient [...] "euthyroid" [...] (i.e. normothyroid). Each of these treatments has advantages and disadvantages. No one treatment approach is considered the best for everyone.|$|E
2500|$|At between {{about the}} ages of four and seven, {{children}} tend to become very curious and ask many questions, beginning the use of primitive reasoning. There is an emergence {{in the interest of}} reasoning and wanting to know why things are the way they are. Piaget called it the [...] "intuitive substage" [...] because children realize they have a vast amount of knowledge, but they are unaware of how they acquired it. Centration, conservation, irreversibility, class inclusion, and transitive inference are all characteristics of <b>preoperative</b> thought.|$|E

50|$|In limb amputees, some, but not all, {{studies have}} found a {{correlation}} between <b>preoperative</b> pain in the affected limb and postoperative phantom pain. There is a significant association between painful and non-painful phantom experiences, <b>preoperative</b> pain in the symptomatic eye and headache. Based on the present data, {{it is difficult to}} determine if headaches or <b>preoperative</b> eye pain play a causal role in the development of phantom phenomena or if headache, <b>preoperative</b> eye pain, and postoperative phantom eye experiences are only epiphenomena of an underlying factor. However, a study in humans demonstrated that experimental pain leads to a rapid reorganization of the somatosensory cortex. This study suggests that <b>preoperative</b> and postoperative pain may be an important co-factor for somatosensory reorganization and the development of phantom experiences.|$|E
