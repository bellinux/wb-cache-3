40|$|According to John Rawls, {{there exists}} a perfect {{procedural}} justice {{for which there is}} no conflict between process and outcome. One such procedure is the Divide and Choose. Recently, the mathematical theory of fair-division extended this idea by developing procedures that offer fairer outcomes and a better guarantee of justice.

40|$|Abstract. The {{mathematical}} model {{to predict the}} temperature history for wood column is {{needed in order to}} determine its fire resistance when exposed to fire. In this paper, an intelligent methodology called Finite Element Method (FEM) of performing analysis for the square and circular wood columns by virtually or artificially developing a temperature history {{mathematical model}}. Numerical simulation model has been developed for the wood column by using two-dimensional mathematical model. The two-dimensional mathematical model was developed by using Galerkin’s Weighted Residual technique. This model focuses on the regional material of the wood column for describing its thermal behavior. When the temperature history in a column and relevant materials properties are known, the strength of the column can be calculated at any time during fire. Therefore, the development of the temperature history mathematical model is a must before any further study to be carried out for the wood columns. The flow of convection will result in minimal increase in the rate of heat energy reaching the column core. The analysis shows that the temperature of the column increases with respect to the duration of exposure to fire. Calculation <b>Procedure</b> <b>Division</b> of cross section into elements.

40|$|Migrating common {{business}} oriented language (Cobol) {{applications from}} HP NonStop Tandem systems to IBM z/OS mainframes requires {{detailed analysis of}} program structuring, variable declaration and keywords and a methodical conversion approach. Executive Summary CIOs facing the rising challenges of higher total cost of operations (TCO) of HP NonStop Tandem systems need to find alternatives. 1 The bulk of applications created for these HP systems use the Cobol programming language. IBM z/OS mainframes provide an alternative with stability and reliability similar to the HP NonStop Tandem systems. However, migrating Cobol applications written for HP Tandem to IBM mainframes is fraught with complexity and is often time-consuming. This white paper delves into recent versions of Cobol on both systems and provides a comprehensive listing of code differences and similarities. The aim is to provide all the relevant information CIOs and application developers need when considering migrating from HP Tandem to the IBM z/OS mainframe. The differences and similarities covered include: • Environment division. • Data division. • <b>Procedure</b> <b>division.</b> Also included is a case study that offers insights into compilation issues found when recompiling an HP Tandem COBOL program on the IBM z/ OS mainframe COBOL Enterprise compiler. The paper concludes by assessing various conversion approaches and tools. Not covered {{is the use of}} Screen COBOL (SCOBOL) language to find differences. The SCO-BOL language on HP Tandem is similar to Cobol and is used to generate graphical user-based interfaces. In addition, we do not tackle embedded SQL programming. Program Organization and Format Figure 1 (on next page) illustrates the difference between the HP Tandem and IBM Cobol reference format. • Program organization and format. • Identification division...|$|E
