We compare three high-throughput chemical lysis methods to sonication, using a robotic platform and methodologies developed in our laboratory [1]. Under the same expression conditions, all lysis methods varied {{in the degree of}} released soluble proteins. With a set of 96 test proteins, we used our split GFP to quantify the soluble and insoluble protein fractions after lysis. Both the amount of soluble protein and the <b>percentage</b> <b>recovered</b> in the soluble fraction using SoluLyse® were well correlated with sonication. Two other methods, Bugbuster® and lysozyme, did not correlate well with sonication.

40|$|The {{empirical}} {{literature on}} pharmacotherapy for bulimia nervosa reveals mixed results. We examined {{the results of}} controlled clinical trials of pharmacotherapies for bulimia pub-lished from 1980 to 1999. To do this, we employed a multidimensional meta-analysis, a method for aggregating a range of clinically meaningful indicators of outcome (including {{but not limited to}} effect-size estimates) across studies. We found that pharmacotherapy for bulimia yields a moderate initial effect. However, only a small minority of patients recover, and the average patient continues to meet full DSM-IV criteria for the disorder. Combined pharmacotherapy and short-term psychotherapy appears to produce better results, although most patients continue to show symptoms at termination, and few data are avail-able on sustained recovery over time. In accordance with recent calls in the medical literature for standardization of reporting practices in clinical trials, we suggest that in-vestigators and meta-analysts report a range of indices that bear on efficacy and general-izability to clinical practice. These include exclusion rates and reasons for exclusion, <b>percentage</b> <b>recovered,</b> percentage improved, percentage remaining improved or recov-ered at follow-up, and percentage seeking additional treatment at follow-up, as well as outcome data for both completer and intent-to-treat samples.

Whole serum distribution studies showed that a signi®cantly lower percentage of AmB from HFZ was recovered in the high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) fractions and a greater <b>percentage</b> <b>recovered</b> in the lipoprotein-de®cient plasma (LPDP), though the majority of both preparations were recovered in LPDP. Circular dichroism (CD) and difference absorption spectroscopy were used to determine the stability of FZ and heat-treated FZ (HFZ) in the presence of HDL, LDL, serum, and albumin. The CD studies indicate that the ``core' ' aggregate of HFZ is more stable in the presence of HDL and LDL, whereas the FZ is less stable and more dynamic with the core aggregate dissociating to a greater extent in the presence of either puri®ed lipoprotein.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Research {{suggests}} that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) {{is the most}} effective psychotherapeutic treatment for bulimia nervosa. One exception was a study that suggested that interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) might be as effective as CBT, although slower to achieve its effects. The present study is designed to repeat this important comparison. METHOD: Two hundred twenty patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for bulimia nervosa were allocated at random to 19 sessions of either CBT or IPT conducted over a 20 -week period and evaluated for 1 year after treatment in a multisite study. RESULTS: Cognitive-behavioral therapy was significantly superior to IPT at the end of treatment in the percentage of participants recovered (29 % [n= 32] vs 6 % [n= 71), the percentage remitted (48 % [n= 53] vs 28 % [n = 31]), and the percentage meeting community norms for eating attitudes and behaviors (41 % [n= 45] vs 27 % [n= 30]).

Recovery traits are affected by site and log position in the stem. Of the post-felling log traits studied, out-of-roundness was the best predictor of green recovery. ContextEucalyptus globulus and Eucalyptus nitens are widely planted in temperate regions of the globe but few studies of rotary peeling have been documented. AimsThis study aims to examine differences among sites and log positions in post-felling log traits and green veneer recovery traits and {{determine the extent to which}} log traits explain variation in recovery traits. MethodsLog traits and green rotary-peeled veneer recovery traits from six temperate eucalypt plantations were studied. Selected plantations encompassed different age, site productivity, silvicultural and species classes in south-eastern Australia. Differences in log and recovery traits among sites and between lower and upper logs were examined, as was the extent to which log traits explained variation in recovery traits. ResultsDifferences among sites for <b>percentage</b> <b>recovered</b> green veneer were non-significant, despite significant differences for peelable billet volume, roundup loss, residual core diameter and all post-felling log traits: small end diameter, sweep, taper, out-of-roundness, end splitting and dynamic modulus of elasticity (MOEdyn). The lower log exhibited more sweep, taper and out-of-roundness but lower MOEdyn and less recovered green veneer.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of an integrated zinc recovery process by means of electrowinning of the stripping solutions coming from the treatment of spent pickling baths (SPB) by a membrane-based solvent extraction (MBSX) process able of increasing the initial Zn/Fe molar ratio. Several stripping solutions containing different concentrations of zinc and iron in acid media obtained previously by the treatment of SPB by MBSX, were subjected to electrowinning to assess the efficiency and selectivity of zinc electrodeposition over iron under different operation conditions. At similar values of the zinc concentration in the stripping solution, {{the influence of the}} Zn/Fe molar ratio on the zinc electrodeposition process was negligible. On the other hand, although the variation of the initial concentration of zinc in the stripping solution neither affected the efficiency of zinc electrowinning, it increased the minimum value of zinc concentration in solution beyond which iron co-deposition started. Finally, the increase in the applied current, promoted the increase in zinc fractional conversion and in the zinc space–time yield, while the zinc current efficiency was reduced due to the stronger effect of secondary reactions. Although the change in the stripping characteristics seems not to strongly affect the zinc electrodeposition process, the use of a pretreatment step based on MBSX technology improved the results in terms of zinc <b>percentage</b> <b>recovered</b> and the rest of figures of merit, in comparison with those obtained by the direct electrowinning of SPB...|$|E
40|$|Phagocytosis is an {{important}} function of both invertebrate and vertebrate blood cells. In this study, the phagocytic activity of haemocyte subpopulations of penaeid shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, (Boone), against pathogenic and nonpathogenic particles was investigated in vitro. The haemocytes of penaeid shrimp were firstly separated by centrifugation on a continuous density gradient of iodixanol into four fractions with five subpopulations (sub), of which sub 1 (hyalinocytes) and sub 4 (semi-granulocytes) have the main function in phagocytosis of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria as well as fluorescent polystyrene beads. It was found that these haemocyte subpopulations engulfed virulent Vibrio campbellii and Vibrio harveyi {{at a higher rate}} than nonvirulent Escherichia coli and polystyrene beads. When these bacteria were mixed with shrimp haemocyte subpopulations and incubated for 180 min, the percentage of viable intracellular V. campbellii (25. 5 +/- 6. 0 %) recovered was significantly higher than the <b>percentage</b> <b>recovered</b> from V. harveyi (13. 5 +/- 1. 1 %). No viable intracellular E. coli was observed in this study. In contrast to V. harveyi and E. coli, V. campbellii containing endosomes did not acidify in time. Incubation of haemocyte subpopulations with the most virulent V. campbellii strain resulted in a significant drop in haemocyte viability (41. 4 +/- 6. 3 % in sub 1 and 30. 2 +/- 15. 1 % in sub 4) after 180 min post-inoculation in comparison with the less virulent V. harveyi (84. 1 +/- 5. 6 % in sub 1 and 83. 4 +/- 4. 1 % in sub 4) and non-virulent E. coli (92. 7 +/- 2. 8 % in sub 1 and 92. 3 +/- 5. 6 % in sub 4) and polystyrene beads (91. 9 +/- 1. 6 % in sub 1 and 84. 4 +/- 3. 4 % in sub 4).

MethodsA prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of thyroxine was carried out in patients with ARF. End points were the percentage requiring dialysis, the <b>percentage</b> <b>recovering</b> renal function, time to recovery, and mortality. ResultsFifty-nine patients were randomized to receive either thyroxine or placebo. The groups were well matched in terms of basal and entry creatinines, age, sex, APACHE II scores at entry, and percentage oliguric. Baseline thyroid functions, including T 3, T 4, rT 3, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, were equal between the two groups and typical of patients with euthyroid sick syndrome.

One year later, the <b>percentage</b> fully <b>recovered</b> increased to 52% in the SFT condition and 29% in the TFP condition, with 70% of the patients in the SFT group achieving [...] "clinically significant and relevant improvement". Moreover, the dropout rate was only 27% for SFT, compared with 50% for TFP.|$|R
30|$|Because of {{discoveries in}} Oman that promised cheaper {{extraction}} costs than the tough Marmul field, the Marmul polymer project was shelved. Today’s economic conditions make the various EOR techniques more feasible. Recently petroleum development Oman (PDO) announced {{the start of}} a large-scale polymer flood project in southern Oman. PDO estimated that by using polymer flooding it could raise the total <b>percentage</b> of oil <b>recovered</b> from the reservoir to the high 20  s or even low 30  s.|$|R
40|$|Multicrystalline silicon wafers {{used for}} solar cells exhibit defect clusters—localized crystal defects in and near grains of some {{specific}} orientations. Defect clusters are also dominant sites for impurity precipitation, and they remain ungettered and unpassivated through the solar cell processing. This paper describes characteristics of defect clusters, and shows, through theory and experiment, that defect clusters typically lower cell efficiency by 3 to 4 absolute <b>percentage</b> points. To <b>recover</b> this efficiency loss, {{it is necessary}} to getter precipitated impurities...|$|R
40|$|The {{difficulty}} {{in predicting the}} properties and behaviour of paper products produced using heterogeneous raw materials with high <b>percentages</b> of <b>recovered</b> fibres poses restrictions on their efficient and effective use as corrugated packaging materials. This work presents predictive models for the mechanical properties of corrugated base papers (liner and fluting-medium) from fibre and physical property data using multiple linear regression and artificial neural networks. The most significant results were obtained for the prediction of the tensile strength of liners in the cross direction from the origin (wood type, pulp method) of the fibres using linear regression, and the prediction of the compressive strength of fluting-medium in the longitudinal (machine) direction, according to the short-span test, using a neural network with one hidden layer with 6 neurons, with coefficients of determination at 95. 14 % and 99. 28 %, respectivel...|$|R
40|$|The {{immobilization}} of Bacillus psychrosaccharolyticus nucleoside 2 ′-deoxyribosyltransferase {{was deeply}} investigated and finally optimized. The best immobilization procedure {{resulted to be}} ionic adsorption on PEI 600 Da agarose followed by crosslinking with 70 % oxidized dextran (20 kDa). The <b>percentage</b> of <b>recovered</b> activity was further improved (from 21 % to 33 %) {{by the addition of}} 20 % glycerol to the immobilization mixture. The resulting biocatalyst showed a stability profile {{similar to that of the}} soluble enzyme and it was used for the preparative synthesis of trifluridine and decytabine obtaining conversions ranging from 50 % to 76 %.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the distribution profile of the novel endotoxin antagonist E 5564 in plasma obtained from fasted human subjects with various lipid concentrations. Radiolabeled E 5564 at 1 μM was incubated in fasted plasma from seven human subjects with various total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) concentrations for 0. 5 to 6 h at 37 °C. Following these incubations, plasma samples were separated into their lipoprotein and lipoprotein-deficient fractions by ultracentrifugation and were assayed for E 5564 radioactivity. TC, TG, and protein concentrations in each fraction were determined by enzymatic assays. Lipoprotein surface charge within control and phosphatidylinositol-treated plasma and E 5564 ’s influence on cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) transfer activity were also determined. We observed that the majority of E 5564 was recovered in the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) fraction. We further observed that incubation in plasma with increased levels of TG-rich lipoprotein (TRL) lipid (TC and TG) concentrations resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of E 5564 recovered in the TRL fraction. In further experiments, E 5564 was preincubated in human TRL. Then, these mixtures were incubated in hypolipidemic human plasma for 0. 5 and 6 h at 37 °C. Preincubation of E 5564 in purified TRL prior to incubation in human plasma resulted in a significant decrease in the <b>percentage</b> of drug <b>recovered</b> in the HDL fraction and an increase in the <b>percentage</b> of drug <b>recovered</b> in the TRL and low-density lipoprotein fractions. These findings suggest that the majority of the drug binds to HDLs. Preincubation of E 5564 in TRL prior to incubation in normolipidemic plasma significantly decreased the <b>percentage</b> of drug <b>recovered</b> in the HDL fraction. Modifications to the lipoprotein negative charge did not alter the E 5564 concentration in the HDL fraction. In addition, E 5564 does not influence CETP-mediated transfer activity. Information from these studies could be used to help identify the possible components of lipoproteins which influence the interaction of E 5564 with specific lipoprotein particles...|$|R
30|$|The {{values of}} the {{demulsification}} rates indicate the destabilizing value of the emulsions, that is, the <b>percentage</b> of water <b>recovered.</b> Thus, it is observed that, regardless {{of the type of}} water used (distilled or sea water), in all types of biosurfactants tested and in all the concentrations used, demulsification of motor oil occurred, with percentages varying between 26 and 66 % demulsification. The chemical surfactant SDS used as control was able to separate 80 % of the motor oil in both distilled and sea water.|$|R
40|$|AIM—To {{measure the}} {{development}} of fat digestion in early life, using a stable isotope breath test.  METHODS—A combined longitudinal and cross sectional study was performed on 30 term and preterm infants using 13 C-labelled mixed triglyceride (MTG). Seventy six tests were performed in all. Results were expressed as cumulative <b>percentage</b> dose <b>recovered</b> over 6 hours (cPDR).  RESULTS—Eighteen of 34 tests performed on infants under 30 days of age showed cPDRs below the normal range for adults and older children. The remainder of tests, performed on infants over 57 days of age, all showed cPDRs within the normal range. Peak PDR correlated significantly (r = 0. 928, p< 0. 01) with cPDR.  CONCLUSION—The capacity to digest fat is incomplete at birth, but quickly develops to normal levels during {{the first months of}} life. The MTG breath test is a useful non-invasive method to measure {{the development of}} fat digestion in early life. ...|$|R
50|$|During the {{excavations}} at the J&J Hunt site 1,632 lithic artifacts {{were recovered}} (Tobon and Pendleton 2002). “Tools consist of unifacial scrapers (22 percent), whole and broken bifacial items (42 percent), and utilized flakes (21 percent). Cores (mostly without much cortex) combine {{for a total}} of 18 percent of the tools, and hammer stones make up an additional 4 percent” (Faught 2004b: 283). The <b>percentage</b> of <b>recovered</b> bifacial lithic remains suggest the manufacture of bifaces and the remaining lithic finds indicate the possibility of tool re-use at the site. However, there is little evidence of secondary retouch flakes at the site (Faught 2004a). The fact that most of the cores and debitage are “mostly without much cortex” infers that the raw materials that these tools were manufactured from came from another location. This is supported by the fact that no quarry areas have been located at the site.|$|R
