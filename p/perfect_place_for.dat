There, he also gave a globe to John Dee. Mercator never accepted the privileges and voting rights of a burgher for they came with military responsibilities which conflicted with his pacifist and neutral stance. Nevertheless, he was on good terms with the wealthier citizens and a close friend of Walter Ghim, the twelve times mayor and Mercator's future biographer.|$|E

25|$|Worldwide {{introduction}} of various mosquito species over large distances into regions {{where they are}} not indigenous has occurred through human agencies, primarily on sea routes, in which the eggs, larvae, and pupae inhabiting water-filled used tires and cut flowers are transported. However, apart from sea transport, mosquitoes have been effectively carried by personal vehicles, delivery trucks, trains, and aircraft. Man-made areas such as storm water retention basins, or storm drains also provide sprawling sanctuaries. Sufficient quarantine measures have proven difficult to implement.

The Stanley Park event started on Easter weekend in 1967 and took place each spring until the mid-1970s {{when most of the}} counterculture movement had fizzled out.

Shanks also suggested Aleks Paunovic, actor and part-time boxer, for the part as the diacon Duke; being a boxer fit into the character's violent nature. Paul McGillion returns as Wexford in the season finale. McGillion first appeared as Wexford in the original webisodes, and since then the producers wanted him to return. Tapping believed that placing him in the finale was [...] "the <b>perfect</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> him." [...] Callum Blue was cast as the finale's antagonist, Edward Forsythe, as the producers believed Blue could portray somebody who is both charming and evil. In the same episode, Sahar Biniaz was cast as Kali; Biniaz was chosen as the producers believed her physical appearance was goddess-like. Balinder Johal played a cult member; she {{was the first person to}} audition for the part, and the producers cast her as she was spiritual, calm, and soft in her appearance. Johal taught the cast how to speak Hindi in parts of the dialogue. The producers were hoping to cast David Hewlett, another Stargate alum, in a guest spot; however, this was met by scheduling issues, as he was shooting a film at the time. Despite this the producers were confident they would cast Hewlett [...] "eventually." ...|$|E

She questions Galsworthy's recommendation of the novel to sportsmen in the foreword, wondering [...] "how many budding sportsmen might have had conversion experiences in the face of Salten's unrelieved harangue and how many might have instead become alienated." [...] In comparing the novel to the Disney film, Steve Chapple of Sports Afield felt that Salten viewed Bambi's forest as a [...] "pretty scary place" [...] and the novel as a whole had a [...] "lot of dark adult undertones." [...] Interpreting it as an allegory for Salten's own life, Chapple felt Salten [...] " [...] across [...] a little morbid, a bleeding heart of a European intellectual." [...] The Wall Street Journals James P. Sterba also considered it an [...] "antifascist allegory" [...] and sarcastically notes that [...] "you'll find it in the children's section at the library, a <b>perfect</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> this 293-page volume, packed as it is with blood-and-guts action, sexual conquest and betrayal" [...] and [...] "a forest full of cutthroats and miscreants.

It was at that time that the first [...] "Bakhtin Circle" [...] formed. The group consisted of intellectuals with varying interests, but all shared a love for the discussion of literary, religious, and political topics. Included in this group were Valentin Voloshinov and, eventually, P. N. Medvedev, who joined the group later in Vitebsk. Vitebsk was “a cultural centre of the region” the <b>perfect</b> <b>place</b> <b>for</b> Bakhtin “and other intellectuals [...] lectures, debates and concerts." [...] German philosophy was the topic talked about most frequently and, from this point forward, Bakhtin considered himself more a philosopher than a literary scholar. It was in Nevel, also, that Bakhtin worked tirelessly on a large work concerning moral philosophy that was never published in its entirety. However, in 1919, a short section of this work was published and given the title [...] "Art and Responsibility". This piece constitutes Bakhtin’s first published work. Bakhtin relocated to Vitebsk in 1920. It was here, in 1921, that Bakhtin married Elena Aleksandrovna Okolovich. Later, in 1923, Bakhtin was diagnosed with osteomyelitis, a bone disease that ultimately led to the amputation of his leg in 1938. This illness hampered his productivity and rendered him an invalid.|$|E

Consequently, amount of bulk cargo carried in containers and transported over seas exploded due to flexibility, reliability and easy handling. Containerization started in midfifties and spread all around the world. Number and capacities of containerships as well as container terminals have increased considerably. Only in the 90 ’s usage of containers has increased 2. 5 times. So efficiency in container terminals {{has become a major}} problem. Today container terminals serve ships that can carry 5000 - 6000 containers. Number of ships to be served and containers to be handled increase day by day. So efficiency during operations has become the key point, thus container terminals become <b>perfect</b> <b>places</b> <b>for</b> Operations Research applications. In this work we deal with a low level operational problem in container terminals. Basically efficient retrieval of containers from their stacks is considered.

In addition, a new concept to further optimize the retrieval operation is introduced, formulated and tested...|$|R
