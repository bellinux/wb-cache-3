The chemical method was performed by acid hydrolysis, acetolysis and acetate formation. Both the <b>pure</b> and modified <b>gums</b> were mixed with PVC at different compositions and cast into films using tetrahydrofuran as solvent. Water absorption study revealed that the acetolysis sample (ACT) absorbs water the most at 14 % water absorbtion, followed by ethylene glycol formulation (EGL) at 3. 9 %. However, <b>pure</b> <b>gum</b> (PGM) has the lowest water absorption at 2. 1 %.

30|$|Silver nitrate (AgNO 3) (E. Merck, Mumbai, India) of {{analytical}} reagent grade {{was used for}} the synthesis. “Gum ghatti” grade- 1 was purchased from Girijan Co-operative Corporation Ltd., Hyderabad, India. All the solutions were prepared in ultra <b>pure</b> water. <b>Gum</b> ghatti was powdered in a Prestige high-speed mechanical blender (Bengaluru, India) and sieved to obtain a mean particle size of 38 μm. Then, 0.5 % (w/v) of homogenous <b>gum</b> <b>stock</b> solution was prepared by adding this powder to reagent bottle containing ultra pure water and stirring overnight at room temperature. Then this solution was centrifuged to remove the insoluble materials and the supernatant was used for all the experiments. The protein concentration in the gum solution was quantified by Lowry’s method using a Bangalore GeneiTM protein estimation kit, Cat No 105560 (Bengaluru, India). The silver nanoparticles were synthesized by autoclaving the silver nitrate solutions containing various concentrations of gum ghatti at 121 °C and 103 kPa of pressure for different durations of time, under dark conditions. The effect of concentration of gum and reaction time on nanoparticle synthesis was studied.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This study aims {{to prepare}} a novel, natural {{nanoparticle}} (NP) as a drug carrier, which also has inherent therapeutic effects. Methods: Pistacia khinjuk gum NPs were prepared and Response surface methodology (RSM) was used for statistical analysis of data and optimizing the size of NPs. Results: NPs were {{in the range of}} 75. 85 – 241. 3 nm. The optimization study was carried out, and an optimized size (70. 86 nm) was obtained using DMSO as a solvent. The volume of the organic phase was 111. 25 µl, and the concentration of gum was 1 % w/v. The cell viability assay was performed on the <b>pure</b> <b>gum</b> and NPs toward β-TC 3, MCF 7, and HT 29 cell lines. It was observed that NPs have higher cytotoxic activity in comparison with <b>pure</b> <b>gum,</b> and that the IC 50 value was achieved at 1 % of NPs in β-TC 3 cells.

40|$|AbstractThis work {{investigates the}} effect of filler loading on curing {{characteristics}} and tensile properties of palygorskite (PAL) natural rubber (NR) nanocomposites. The nanocomposites were prepared by {{using a combination of}} melt mixing and latex compounding method. Five different samples with different filler loading namely PAL 2 (2 phr), PAL 4 (4 phr), PAL 6 (6 phr), PAL 8 (8 phr) and PAL 10 (10 phr) were prepared in this work. All the samples were subjected to curing and tensile test. All the results were compared with <b>pure</b> <b>gum</b> of natural rubber. The curing characteristics of PAL/NR nanocomposites such as minimum and maximum torque were higher at optimum filler loading, PAL 4. It means that the optimum filler loading would produce higher rigidity of the sample. Thus, PAL 4 had higher stiffness compared to other filler loading. The scorch time and cure time of the sample that had undergone melt mixing and latex compounding method were higher compared to NR. The increase in both scorch time and cure time revealed that the presence of PAL could increase the curing process of the nanocomposites. Furthermore, PAL 4 showed 18 % increment in tensile strength. These results showed the optimum filler loading can increase the compatibility between PAL and NR. The size and shape of the PAL and the combination of melt mixing and latex compounding method might also contribute to this improvement. The morphology characteristics of all PAL/NR nanocomposites sample showed thicker tear line and rougher surface compared to control sample, NR. This might due to the homogenous dispersion of PAL which contains optimum filler loading. Thus, 4 phr of palygorskite loading found to be the optimum filler loading with a combination of melt mixing and latex compounding methods...|$|R
25|$|Although {{chewing gum}} {{can be traced}} back to civilizations around the world, the {{modernization}} and commercialization of this product mainly took place in the United States.

Around 1850 a gum made from paraffin wax, which is a petroleum product, was developed and soon exceeded the spruce gum in popularity. To sweeten these early gums the chewer would often make use of a plate of powdered sugar, which they would repeatedly dip the gum into to maintain sweetness.

40|$|Economic {{demands for}} milk and meat {{products}} force farmers {{to increase the}} carbohydrate content of grains fed to animals. One {{of the consequences of}} this intervention is the lactic acidosis condition in animals fed the high-concentrate diets, which is the accumulation of lactic acid in the rumen. Symptoms of the condition include lameness, bloatedness, epistaxis and dilated pupils. Methods such as ionophore antibiotics, gradual transition from high to low-concentrate diets and yeast cultures have in the past been used to avert this condition but all had their disadvantages. Microorganisms may develop resistance to the ionophore antibiotics; gradual transition time may be too long for production and yeast cultures have been reported to be ineffective when used alone. Megasphaera elsdenii, a major lactate utiliser of the rumen of animals, {{has been used as a}} direct-fed microbial in the management of lactic acid levels. Studies on M. elsdenii NCIMB 41125 have shown that the bacterium is an effective lactic acid utiliser. Megasphaera elsdenii NCIMB 41125 was cultured in a Biostat Braun B fermenter where growth yields were attempted to be optimised by using a pulse-and-shift method. A semi-defined lactate (SDL) and corn steep liquor (CSL) media, which contained reducing agents, to ensure anaerobiosis, were used in the optimisation and shelf-life studies. Culture stability studies were performed on samples from a fermenter, and subsequently in stainless-steel kegs. Samples for analysis were then taken from the kegs. Preservation of M. elsdenii NCIMB 41125 and prevention of cell settlement methods were also evaluated using a combination of sodium lactate / glycerol and <b>pure</b> xanthan <b>gum</b> / gelatin, respectively. The cultures were harvested using either continuous or fed-batch fermentations. Shelf-life was better for cultures grown on SDL medium with a lower concentration of lactic acid, a finding which related to the substrate affinity of M. elsdenii NCIMB 41125. Higher growth yields were obtained from secondary cultures which had been continuously harvested into stainless-steel kegs. Shelf-life results obtained from the use of corn steep liquor (CSL) medium were almost similar to those obtained when SDL medium was used, however, the problem with CSL data was the variability between batches. None of the preservation or prevention of cell settlement methods resulted in positive responses, although <b>pure</b> xanthan <b>gum</b> preserved cultures for the six days evaluated. In order to avert a sudden reduction of viable cells when high concentrations of lactic acid are used, it could be necessary to harvest cells during the secondary growth phase.

Previous field and laboratory testing of adhesives has shown the complexities involved in creating an effective Middle Stone Age glue using Acacia gum. However, it is currently unclear how efficient different adhesive recipes are, how much specific ingredients influence their performance, and how difficult it may have been for those ingredients to be combined to maximum effect. We conducted a series of laboratory-based lap shear and impact tests, following modern adhesion testing standards, to determine the efficacy of compound adhesives, with particular regard to the ingredient ratios. We tested rosin (colophony) and gum adhesives, containing additives of beeswax and ochre in varying ratios. During both lap shear and impact tests compound rosin adhesives performed better than single component rosin adhesives, and <b>pure</b> acacia <b>gum</b> was the strongest. The large difference in performance between each base adhesive and the significant changes in performance that occur due to relatively small changes in ingredient ratios lend further support to the notion that high levels of skill and knowledge were required to consistently produce the most effective adhesives...|$|R

40|$|Mamaku gum is a {{polysaccharide}} {{extracted from}} the fronds of the black tree fern found in New Zealand. The cooked pith has traditionally been used for various medicinal purposes and as a food source by the Maori people of New Zealand. It has potential applications as a thickener in the food industry and as a palliative for patients with dysphagia. Studies on the shear rheology of Mamaku gum have revealed that the gum exhibits shear thickening at a critical shear rate due to a transition from intra- to inter-molecular chain interactions upon shear-induced chain elongation. In this paper, we demonstrate that these interactions are primarily due to hydrogen bonding. We perform extensional rheology on mixtures of Mamaku gum and urea (a known disruptor of hydrogen bonds) to quantify {{the nature of these}} interactions. Capillary Breakup Extensional Rheometry (CaBER) performed on the <b>pure</b> Mamaku <b>gum</b> solutions yield plateau values of the Trouton ratio as high as ∼ 10 [superscript 4], showing that the viscoelasticity of the gum in uniaxial elongation is much higher than in shear. For all Mamaku concentrations tested, the extensional viscosity decreases upon increasing urea concentration. Furthermore, the relaxation time decreases exponentially with increasing urea concentration. This exponential relationship is independent of the Mamaku concentration, and is identical to the relationships between urea concentration and characteristic timescales measured in nonlinear shear rheology. We show using the sticky reptation model for polymers with multiple sticker groups along the backbone how such a relationship is consistent with a linear decrease in the free energy for hydrogen bond dissociation. We then demonstrate that a time-concentration superposition principle can be used to collapse the viscoelastic properties of the Mamaku-gum/urea mixtures. United States.
