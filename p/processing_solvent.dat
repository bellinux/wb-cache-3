However, for many applications an insoluble active layer can offer technological advantages in terms of robustness to <b>processing</b> <b>solvents.</b> This is particularly relevant in field-effect transistors (FET), where processing of dielectrics or barriers from solution {{on top of the}} semiconductor layer typically imposes the use of orthogonal solvents in order not to interfere with the nanometer thick accumulation channel. To this end, the use of latent pigments, highly soluble molecules which can produce insoluble films after a post-deposition thermal cleavage of solubilizing groups, is a very promising strategy. In this contribution, we demonstrate the use of tert-Butyloxycarbonyl (t-Boc) functionalized diketopyrrolopyrrole and perylene-diimide small molecules for good hole and electron transporting films. t-Boc thermal cleavage produces a densification of the films, along with a strong structural rearrangement of the deprotected molecules, strongly improving charge mobility in both p- and n-type FET. We also highlight the robustness of these highly insoluble semiconducting layers to typical and aggressive <b>processing</b> <b>solvents.</b> These results can greatly enhance the degree of freedom in the manufacturing of multi-layered organic electronic devices, offering enhanced stability to harsh processing steps...|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} high-performance sequentially solution-processed organic photovoltaics (OPVs) with a {{power conversion}} efficiency (PCE) of 5 % for blend films using a donor polymer based on the isoindigo-bithiophene repeat unit (PII 2 T-C 10 C 8) and a fullerene derivative [6, 6]-phenyl-C[71]-butyric acid methyl ester (PC 71 BM). This has been accomplished by systematically controlling the swelling and intermixing processes of the layer with various <b>processing</b> <b>solvents</b> during deposition of the fullerene. We find that among the solvents used for fullerene deposition that primarily swell but do not re-dissolve the polymer underlayer, there were significant microstructural differences between chloro and o-dichlorobenzene solvents (CB and ODCB, respectively). Specifically, we show that the polymer crystallite orientation distribution in films where ODCB was used to cast the fullerene is broad. This indicates that out-of-plane charge transport through a tortuous transport network is relatively efficient due to a large density of inter-grain connections. In contrast, using CB results in primarily edge-on oriented polymer crystallites, which leads to diminished out-of-plane charge transport. We correlate these microstructural differences with photocurrent measurements, which clearly show that casting the fullerene out of ODCB leads to significantly enhanced power conversion efficiencies. Thus, we believe that tuning the <b>processing</b> <b>solvents</b> used to cast the electron acceptor in sequentially-processed devices is a viable way to controllably tune the blend film microstructure. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} pattern {{functional}} polymers at different length scales {{is important for}} the advancement of modern science and technology. This dissertation mainly describes the work done on the high resolution patterning of polymer thin films that have a variety of potential uses. The nanoscale patterning of spun-coated polar polymers was demonstrated using environmentally benign supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2) as a <b>processing</b> <b>solvent.</b> The use of scCO 2 as a <b>processing</b> <b>solvent</b> has several technical advantages that help resolve some of the key problems faced in lithography. In addition, it helps reduce the energy and resource usage that can negatively affect the environment. scCO 2 is generally a poor solvent for high molecular weight polymers that are used as standard photoresists. Chapter 2 describes a series of fluorinated quaternary ammonium salts that were synthesized and used as CO 2 compatible additives to aid the dissolution of polar polymer photoresists in scCO 2. Using these dissolution aids, patterns as small as 100 nm lines were obtained with scCO 2 development. Chapters 3 and 4 focus on the patterning of high-tech thin polymer films referred to as polymer brushes. In these films the polymer chains are covalently attached to a surface. A direct method of patterning polymer brushes in a single step using electron beam lithography has been described. Polymer brushes of different structures such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) brushes, poly(2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) brushes, poly(isobutyl methacrylate) (PIBMA) brushes, poly(neopentyl methacrylate) (PNPMA) brushes and poly(2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethyl methacrylate) (PTFEMA) brushes were grown via atom transfer radical polymerization. These brushes were directly patterned using e-beam and their sensitivity to e-beam patterning has been compared and explained. This direct patterning approach produced polymer brush patterns down to 50 nm lines. Due to the number of advantages of using scCO 2 as a <b>processing</b> <b>solvent,</b> the dry development of a directly patterned low surface energy coating composed of PTFEMA brushes in scCO 2 has been demonstrated in Chapter 4. Using scCO 2 as a developer, patterned PTFEMA brushes with 150 nm lines were obtained. Polymer brushes have been used to prepare biocompatible surfaces with reduced non-specific adsorption. Chapter 5 describes the synthesis of a new oligo(ethylene glycol) containing ATRP intiator to prevent non-specific adsorption of biomolecules on polymer brush coated gold electrodes. The adsorption of non-specific antibodies on modified gold electrodes was studied using cyclic voltammetry. Poly(acrylic acid) brushes grown using this new ATRP initiator showed reduced nonspecific binding of the gold electrodes. There has been a continuing need for developing new medical countermeasures for emerging infectious diseases. Chapter 6 describes the role of functionalized poly(acrylic acid) brushes {{in the development of a}} biosensor based on sensitive electrochemical detection of the intrinsic catalytic activity of antibodies. Poly(acrylic acid) brushes have been functionalized with 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl groups (model antigen) and Ni-NTA to immobilize specific antibodies on the sensor surface. The modification of gold surfaces with polymer brushes provides a bio- and electronically compatible substrate with high density of specific haptens with reduced non-specific adsorption...|$|E

Through {{the use of}} solution-processable organic materials, electronic devices can be fabricated on large-area, lightweight, flexible substrates to produce {{a new class of}} electronics. Patterning methods for organic electronics represents one of the major obstacles to be overcome in organic device fabrication. A high-resolution, high-throughput system with good registration capabilities is required to realize the potential for organic electronics, both in performance and commercialization. The well-established photolithographic patterning method has only been marginally useful in patterning organic electronic materials due to incompatibility issues between the organic materials and conventional lithographic <b>processing</b> <b>solvents</b> and resists. Many alternate patterning methods have thus been developed, however none of which are able to match photolithography in resolution and throughput. This thesis presents research performed toward the goal of developing lithographic patterning methods for organic electronic devices.

All of the systems consist of fluorinated resist materials, which were designed and synthesized to be fully processable in hydrofluoroether solvents.

40|$|Manufacturing {{strategy}} {{is important for}} the appropriate incorporation of filler into a polymeric matrix, and this in particular refers to nanofilers. Direct-graphite nanoplatelets (GNP) were used as filler in polystyrene (PS). The as-received GNP material contained microscopic size agglomerates formed by nanoscopic size graphite nanoplatelets. Refining of the microagglomerates (break-up) and production of graphene layers (exfoliation) desirably needs to take place during manufacturing. Herein, several melt processing methods used to prepare GNP/PS are in focus. The manufacturing methods used include both, melt and solvent routes, and include elongational flow mixing (EFM), high shear energy micro compounding, roll-milling/calendering, and Brabender mixing chamber, as well as sonication and surfactant assisted <b>solvent</b> <b>processing</b> using N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP). We analyze particle break-up and exfoliation, and the effects on electrical conductivity and surface smoothness of the composite, both of importance in high-voltage applications. The composite is characterized by melt rheology, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with MeX surface topography software, optical microscopy with image analysis, X-ray Diffraction (XRD), and electrical resistivity measurements. We find that manufacturing processes influence the material´s morphology and properties in different ways. As could be expected, sonication and surfactant assisted <b>solvent</b> <b>processing</b> yielded both good deagglomeration and production of thin graphene stacks/layers. Elongational flow dispersive mixing, studied here using a recently developed mixer (RMX, Scamex, France), efficiently refines the GNP microagglomerates, and the particle break-up is closely comparable to that in <b>solvent</b> <b>processing.</b> Both the processes yield composites having smoother surfaces compared to the ones from other <b>processing</b> methods. <b>Solvent</b> <b>processing</b> and micro-compounding are more efficient than the other processes in the production of exfoliated thin graphene stacks/ layers.

40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses and}} illuminates a little understood region of miscible polymer mixtures and demonstrates a new means of separating wax from such blends. The method, termed Deformation Induced Phase Segregation potentially eliminates need of toxic <b>processing</b> <b>solvents</b> for wax removal or recovery in {{these types of}} blends. Previous theories of polymer combinations address them exclusively as solutions or as blends, two independent classes having very different behaviors. This study provides bridge connecting these two classes by identifying crossover points {{between them and the}} behaviors exhibited therein. The blends of this form were found to be semi-miscible, forming a homogenous phase in the melt but a two-phase system in the solid, with the rheological behavior influenced by the polymer's molecular weight and architecture. It also demonstrates practical promise of this regime by introducing a mechanical compression process to separate the wax phase from such a type of blend. This process potentially permits production of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMwPE) films and fibers by melt processing, thereby obviating need of otherwise essential but expensive and environmentally unfriendly toxic solvents.

However, commercialization of polymer-based electronic devices has been restricted owing to low device performance of solidified thin-films. In order to enhance charge transport of polymer semiconductor thin-films, the self-organization of organic polymer semiconductors into ordered supramolecular assemblies has been achieved by tuning a range of process parameters including film deposition method (spin vs. drop cast), solvent boiling point (low vs. high boiling point), polymer-dielectric interface treatment, and post-deposition <b>processing</b> (<b>solvent</b> vapor or thermal annealing).

We synthesize CPIs by converting cross-conjugated aromatic polyketones to linearly-conjugated, cationic polyarylmethines via a process we call “spinless doping”. We studied the effects of varying combinations of polymer backbones and pendant groups between ionic/hydrophilic and aliphatic/hydrophobic, and compared film morphologies by atomic force microscopy (AFM). We observe a clear trend; conjugated polymers in which the pendant groups and backbone are matched, either ionic–ionic or hydrophobic–hydrophobic, form smooth, structured, homogenous films from water (ionic) or THF (hydrophobic). The fully ionic polymers are CPIs and demonstrate a comparable film morphology with conventional conjugated polymers, comprising hydrophobic backbones and pendant groups. Mis-matched conjugated polymers, by contrast, form inhomogeneous films with rough topologies, with obvious signs of deleterious aggregation and precipitation. The methods that are developed in this thesis form the groundwork towards a new class of water-processable conjugated polymers.

This may {{be followed by}} processes such as melt casting, or processing from a solution (e.g. solution casting, spin coating, and film casting). Langmuir-Blodgett films have also been made. In the case of solution-based <b>processing,</b> typical <b>solvents</b> used include dimethylformamide and the more volatile butanone. In aqueous emulsion polymerization, the fluorosurfactant perfluorononanoic acid is used in anion form as a processing aid by solubilizing monomers. Compared to other fluoropolymers, it has an easier melt process because of its relatively low melting point of around 177 °C.|$|R
40|$|In {{the most}} {{efficient}} plastic solar cells to date, sunlight is absorbed in an ultrathin layer of a semiconducting polymer mixed with an n-type organic material. Collected photons are directly converted into electricity via the complex processes of generation, dissociation, transport and extraction of electric charges. The power conversion efficiency of plastic solar cells strongly depends on the optical and electronic properties of the utilized polymer. In many cases, the performance is limited due to impediments {{in one or more}} of the processes mentioned above. This work studies the device physical origin of such performance limitations for various polymer-based photovoltaic systems and discusses how these can be minimized. Based on experimental characterization and device modeling, it is shown how molecular weight, choice of <b>processing</b> <b>solvent</b> and chemical side-reactions during fabrication can affect the operation of single-layer plastic solar cells. Moreover, we show that in specific cases optical and electronic losses can be reduced simultaneously by using a device structure with two photoactive layers. Careful design of the required middle electrode enables such double junction cells to show enhanced performance compared to optimized single layer devices. These results and the outcome of extensive optoelectronic modeling path the way towards efficient solution-processed tandem polymer solar cells that contain two complementary absorbing photoactive layers. ...|$|E
40|$|We have {{monitored}} the regulatory {{use of the}} LLNA for chemicals registration {{from the time of}} its adoption as stand alone method at the OECD to 2008. For this, we screened the New Chemicals Database (NCD) which was managed during this period by the former European Chemicals Bureau (ECB) at the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC). The NCD comprises chemicals notified after 1981, where registered data have been derived according to regulatory standards, including GLP and predominantly according to official test methods. The database was searched to extract records for which the information for skin sensitisation labelling was based on results derived with the LLNA. The details of these records were extracted and pooled, for a total of 545 entries, and evaluated with regards to the extent of use of the LLNA over time and countries, as well as analysing the information derived on critical aspects of the procedure e. g strain and amount of animals used, lymph node <b>processing,</b> <b>solvent</b> and doses selected, stimulation indices, and assessing their level of compliance to the OECD 429. Additional information on labelling was extracted, and its significance for the potential of the widespread use of the reduced version of the LLNA is discussed on the text. JRC.

40|$|Milk fat has a {{very rich}} {{chemical}} composition and unique organoleptic properties. It is the only relevant natural source of short-chain fatty acids (C 4 to C 10), which have been associated to several health effects. Milk fat also contains a series of minor, bioactive lipids with anticarcinogenic, antidepressant and bactericidal activity. In the last decades, however, the consumption of milk fat in developed countries has decreased gradually, mainly due to its relatively high price compared to margarines and a negatively perceived health image, derived from its content of cholesterol and saturated fatty acids. Consequences of the consumption decline are the accumulation of milk fat stocks, which leads to instability in the dairy sector. A promising strategy for the revalorization of milk fat encompasses a more effective use of both its major and minor components. The aim of this thesis was to conceive and develop novel routes for the synthesis of added-value derivatives from milk fat, focusing {{on the use of}} the major components of milk fat (fatty acids) and on the preservation of its natural characteristics (flavor, aroma, texture). To this end, enzymatic or physical modifications of milk fat were applied. The use of supercritical carbon dioxide as a <b>processing</b> <b>solvent</b> in reaction, extraction and micronization operations was explored in this context, with a special focus on the possibility of process integration.

40|$|In recent years, the {{utilization}} of renewable resources, particularly lignocellulosic biomass based raw materials, to replace synthetic materials/polymers for the manufacture of green materials has gained increased worldwide interest due to growing global environmental awareness, concepts of sustainability {{and the absence of}} conflict between food and chemical/materials production. However, structural heterogeneity and the presence of networks of inter- and intra-molecular interactions in biopolymer matrices remain unsolved challenges to clean pretreatment for biocomposite processing. A number of techniques including physical, physico-chemical and chemical methods have been investigated for the pretreatment of renewable resources. Most of these methods require high temperatures and pressures, as well as highly concentrated chemicals for the pretreatment process. Fortunately, ionic liquids (ILs) – potentially attractive “green” recyclable alternatives to environmentally harmful organic solvents – have been increasingly exploited as solvents and/or (co) solvents and/or reagents for biopolymer processing. Compared to conventional approaches, ILs in processing biodegradable composites exhibit many advantages such as being noncorrosive and nonvolatile, having excellent dissolution power under relatively mild conditions and high thermal stability. Presently, a wide range of different approaches have been explored to further improve the performance of ILs processing of biobased polymers for composites manufacturing. The main goal of this review is to present recent technological developments in which the advantages of ILs as <b>processing</b> <b>solvents</b> for biopolymers for the production of a plethora of green composites have been gradually realized. It is hoped that the present article will inspire new ideas and new approaches in ILs-assisted processing of renewable resources for green composite production...|$|R
40|$|Electrospun {{chitosan}} nanofiber mats {{have been}} obtained using chitosan solutions {{in a mixture of}} trifluoroacetic acid and dichloromethane. The relationship between <b>processing</b> parameters (<b>solvent</b> composition, polymer concentration in the solution, feeding rate, applied voltage, traveling distance between the needle, and the collector) and fiber morphology was studied. Taguchi 2 ̆ 7 s methodology was followed to determine which parameters have the strongest influence on mean fiber diameter and fiber homogeneity. Chitosan nanofibers obtained with this procedure were water soluble due to the protonation of amine side groups but were successfully neutralized by immersion in calcium carbonate solutions. It was established that fiber diameter is mainly determined by the solution concentration and the distance from the needle to the collector while other parameters have less influence. The set of parameters that produce the thinnest fibers were a concentration of 8 wt...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} study {{of the influence of}} processing route on polyurethanes (PU) / Multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composites mechanical and electrical properties and also morphology was undergone employing two differentiated <b>processing</b> methods, <b>solvent</b> casting and buckypaper infiltration, for producing PU composites with low, medium and high mass fractions of acid treated MWCNT, and with no covalent linkages between the matrix and the nanotubes. As for example, with a MWCNT mass fraction of ~ 18 wt% the second method produced stiffer (270 MPa), lighter (948 kg m- 3) and more electrically conductive (1. 8 S cm- 1) composite while the first one gave softer (111 MPa) and more ductile (141 %) materials. These properties differences are related to the different PU/MWCNT dispositions obtained through each synthesis route. Nanotubes percolating concentration is found to be crucial on composite properties evolution and a preferential interaction of MWCNT with PU hard segments is observed for solvent cast composites...|$|R
