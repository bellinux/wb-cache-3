[...] The New York Times' Neil Genzlinger opened saying the show was [...] "shameless in its use of hoary stereotypes.

The song also peaked at No.29 on the Billboard Hot 100, in addition to reaching top 10 on the Adult Contemporary charts (the band's first appearance on that chart). Regarding the song's popularity among fans who have used the song to cope with personal losses, Prout said, [...] "Actually, 'One More Day' was recorded as a love song.

5000|$|Robert X. Cringely, {{author of}} Accidental Empires and {{creator of the}} documentaries Triumph of the Nerds and Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, argues that [...] "the film is beautifully shot and Kutcher's {{portrayal}} of Jobs, while not spot-on, is <b>pretty</b> <b>darned</b> good. He certainly has the look down and the walk. But Ashton Kutcher also produced this film and he's definitely a better actor than producer. There {{are a lot of}} historical inaccuracies that just don't have to be there. ... The great failing of this film is the same failing as with Walter Isaacson's book: something happened during Steve's NeXT years (which occupy less than 60 seconds of this 122 minute film) that turned Jobs from a brat into a leader, but they don't bother to cover that." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle states that [...] "at its best, it's a good picture, and at its worst, it's almost good." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone suggests that [...] "Kutcher nails the genius and narcissism. It's a quietly dazzling performance" [...] but also notes that [...] "Jobs is a one-man show that needed to go for broke and doesn't. My guess is that Jobs would give it a swat." [...] Contributor for rogerebert.com, Susan Wloszczyna, gave the movie 2/4 stars, saying that, [...] "Rather than attempting a deeper plunge behind the whys and wherefores of the elite business-model gospel according to Apple Inc. guru Steve Jobs and - more importantly - what it says about our culture, the filmmakers follow the easy rise-fall-rise-again blueprint familiar to anyone who has seen an episode of VH1's Behind the Music." [...] She further discusses how Kutcher's performance and the overall movie failed to portray Jobs in iconic manner that current pop culture suggests even after Jobs' passing. In a movie review for The New York Times, writer Manohla Dargis writes that Jobs was [...] "inevitably unsatisfying" [...] and a result of a poor performance of the filmmakers rather than the actors themselves.|$|R
