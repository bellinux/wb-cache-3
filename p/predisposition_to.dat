5|$|During his {{successful}} {{campaign for the}} U.S. presidency, Dwight Eisenhower pledged to pursue a more proactive anti-communist policy, promising to roll back communism, rather than contain it. Working {{in an atmosphere of}} increasing McCarthyism in government circles, Eisenhower was more willing than Truman to use the CIA to depose governments the U.S. disliked. Although PBFORTUNE had been quickly aborted, tension between the U.S. and Guatemala continued to rise, especially with the legalization of the communist PGT, and its inclusion in the government coalition for the elections of January 1953. Articles published in the U.S. press often reflected this <b>predisposition</b> <b>to</b> see communist influence; for example, a New York Times article about the visit to Guatemala by Chilean poet Pablo Neruda highlighted his communist beliefs, but neglected to mention his reputation as the greatest living poet in Latin America.|$|E

He {{reportedly}} had uremia and a urethral obstruction, both of which deteriorated into Fournier gangrene, which killed him soon after. Later speculation that Ruiz had been poisoned or killed has been countered by three facts: that Ruiz's brother, Mariano Ruiz Quiñones (who was the coordinator of the revolution in Curaçao), died of the same condition soon after (suggesting a genetic <b>predisposition</b> <b>to</b> it), that Betances had used a catheter on Ruiz before he left Saint Thomas to bring him some relief from his condition, and that Betances published a medical article in France twenty years later, in 1887, that discussed the condition, out {{of what he had}} described as many years of second-guessing what could have been done to save Ruiz's life.|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the significance of}} Aspergillus species isolated from sputum or other respiratory secretions {{with respect to the}} diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, the clinical records and radiographs of all patients whose respiratory secretion cultures yielded an Aspergillus species between 1972 and 1978 were reviewed. All known <b>predispositions</b> <b>to</b> invasive aspergillosis, e. g., presence of cancer or granulocytopenia, and therapy with corticosteroids, antibiotics, and cytotoxic drugs, were significantly associated with proven or probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Most notable were patients with acute leukemia and granulocytopenia. Prolonged duration of hospitalization between initial isolation (greater than 2 weeks) and multiple isolates (greater than three isolates) were also significantly associated with a high frequency of proven or probable disease. Isolation of A. niger was only rarely associated with proven or probable disease (one of eight patients). The isolation of A. fumigatus and A. flavus from respiratory secretions does not usually represent laboratory contamination and must be interpreted in the light of known <b>predispositions</b> <b>to</b> aspergillosis. In some situations, e. g., granulocytopenic patients with acute leukemia, even a single isolation carries a high likelihood of invasive aspergillosis...|$|R

Easy {{access to credit}} can push economic activity above sustainable levels, eventually requiring cutbacks in spending, lay-offs from over-grown sectors, and write-downs of bad debts.

First, tendencies toward over-borrowing have roots in consumers' <b>predispositions</b> <b>to</b> conform to rising consumption norms. Second, following Commons, regulation should be confined to >i>bona fide>/i> public problems not better solved via private means. These insights imply that reregulation of consumer-credit markets by itself {{is not the right}} way to tackle problems of debt-financed consumption sprees. consumption, consumer debt, spending habits, consumer protection,...|$|R
