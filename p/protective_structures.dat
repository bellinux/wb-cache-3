25|$|Seeds of {{many plants}} have evolved {{a variety of}} {{defenses}} to deter predation from seed predators. Plants may allocate resources toward physical or chemical defenses. Seeds are often contained inside <b>protective</b> <b>structures</b> or fruit pulp that encapsulate seeds until they are ripe.

Seeds, especially in arid areas, may have a mucilaginous seed coat that can glue soil to seed hiding it from granivores.|$|E
25|$|Meeting the {{specification}} for {{all these}} ecological uses requires different types of silk suited to different broad properties, as either a fibre, a structure of fibres, or a silk-globule. These types include glues and fibres. Some types of fibres are used for structural support, others for constructing <b>protective</b> <b>structures.</b> Some can absorb energy effectively, whereas others transmit vibration efficiently. In a spider, these silk types are produced in different glands; so the silk from a particular gland {{can be linked to}} its use by the spider.|$|E

According to the design requirements of temporary and mobile <b>protective</b> <b>structure</b> in the pipeline project, which guarantee the safety of construction personnel, firstly the various factors affecting the {{stability of}} slope of pipeline after excavation is analysed by applying geological method. Then, the interaction mechanism between the slope soil and the <b>protective</b> <b>structure</b> is studied. After that, the computing method of the <b>protective</b> <b>structure</b> is established by using the classical earth pressure theory. These methods were verified and applied in engineering examples. The results show that, this method, which uses different calculation mode of earth pressure for different lithology and different conditions, has a positive significance to the rational design of <b>protective</b> <b>structure</b> in pipeline construction...|$|R

Rational and effective application of natural light in modern architectural design, reduces the consumption of energy, cuts down on architectural operation, maintenance, and management costs. It {{is an issue that}} must be taken into consideration and resolved for modern and future architects in design. The architectural world that we live in is composed of various materials. To choose the right materials, integrate and construct an ideal environment with natural light, and create architectures that communicate with people, are the objective of designers. 1 The relationship between natural light materials for modern <b>protective</b> <b>structure</b> outside architectures To explicitly express oneself, things have to be presented in natural light, {{so that it can be}} perceived and accepted by our optic nerves. Modern <b>protective</b> <b>structure</b> outside architectures is the “shell ” of architectural space. It has functions of sheltering, introducing in natural light, and air exchange. The main relationship between materials of <b>protective</b> <b>structure</b> outside architectures and natural light, is that light can distinctively display the status the materials for <b>protective</b> <b>structure.</b> At the same time, the selection of materials, on some degree, determines the relationship between architecture an...|$|R

2500|$|Sheep {{producers}} {{have used a}} wide variety of measures to try to combat predation throughout history. Pre-modern shepherds had only the most basic of tools: their own presence, livestock guardian dogs, and [...] <b>protective</b> <b>structures</b> such as barns and fencing. Fencing (both regular and electric), penning sheep at night and lambing indoors all continue to be widelyused methods of protection today. Whereas sheepdogs herd sheep, guardian dogs are trained to integrate into flocks and protect them from predators. The ability of these dogs to do so is a transference of the canine pack social structure on to a flock. Following their invention, the focus in dealing with predators shifted to the nearly exclusive use of guns, traps, and poisons to kill predators both defensively and preemptively. The population of predator species plummeted worldwide, pushing some to extinction (such as the thylacine) or significantly reducing their original ranges. With the appearance of the environmental and conservation movements, and subsequent state, provincial, national and international legislation, simply exterminating predator species failed to be a legally viable option for protecting flocks. However, many countries maintain government agenciessuch as the Wildlife Services program, a wing of the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to shoot, poison and trap predators that threaten sheep. Wildlife conservation organizations charge that this killing is both indiscriminate and ineffective at protecting sheep.|$|E

The fallout radiation was represented by measurements of the penetration of cobalt-60 gamma radiation, which has a high mean energy of 1.25 MeV (two gamma rays, 1.17 and 1.33 MeV). This is considerably more penetrating than the mean 0.7 MeV of fallout gamma rays. Therefore, the actual protection given against real nuclear weapon fallout would be far greater than that afforded in the peacetime cobalt-60 shielding measurements.|$|E
