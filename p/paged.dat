5|$|The +3 saw the {{addition}} of two more 16KB ROMs. One was home to {{the second part of}} the reorganised 128 ROM and the other hosted the +3's disk operating system. This was a modified version of Amstrad's PCWDOS (the disk access code used in LocoScript), called +3DOS. These two new 16KB ROMs and the original two 16KB ROMs were now physically implemented together as two 32KB chips. To be able to run CP/M, which requires RAM at the bottom of the address space, the bank-switching was further improved, allowing the ROM to be <b>paged</b> out for another 16KB of RAM.|$|E

5|$|They {{finished}} 8–3 in 1941, {{and held}} a ceremony to honor the future Hall of Famer Leemans in the final regular season game on December 7, 1941. Leemans {{had been with the}} Giants since 1936, when he led the league in rushing as a rookie with 830yards. A versatile performer, he rushed for over 3,000yards, and passed for over 2,300 in his career. During the course of the game the stadium announcer <b>paged</b> Colonel William Joseph Donovan to answer a call from Washington, D.C., and told all servicemen to return to their units, but it was only when the game concluded that players and spectators learned of the attack on the naval base at Pearl Harbor earlier that day. New York advanced to the championship game following the season, in which they lost to the Bears 37–9. Both the 1940 and 1941 championship games were close early before their respective opponents went on an offensive surge to break the games open late. In 1942 and 1943, the Giants totalled an 11–8–2 record and failed to make the postseason.|$|E

25|$|When {{executing}} {{software from}} NAND memories, virtual memory strategies are often used: memory contents {{must first be}} <b>paged</b> or copied into memory-mapped RAM and executed there (leading to the common combination of NAND + RAM). A memory management unit (MMU) in the system is helpful, but this can also be accomplished with overlays.

25|$|The XPS Print Path {{introduced}} in Windows Vista supports high quality 16-bit color printing. The XPS print path uses XML Paper Specification (XPS) as the print spooler file format, {{that serves as}} the page description language (PDL) for printers. The XPS spooler format is the intended replacement for the Enhanced Metafile (EMF) format which is the print spooler format in the Graphics Device Interface (GDI) print path. XPS is an XML-based (more specifically XAML-based) color-managed device and resolution independent vector-based <b>paged</b> document format which encapsulates an exact representation of the actual printed output. XPS documents are packed in a ZIP container along with text, fonts, raster images, 2D vector graphics and DRM information. For printers supporting XPS, this eliminates an intermediate conversion to a printer-specific language, increasing the reliability and fidelity of the printed output. Microsoft claims that major printer vendors are planning to release printers with built-in XPS support and that this will provide better fidelity to the original document.|$|E

500|$|In the 1990s, the {{television}} industry made wide use of spec scripts, or episode scripts solicited from freelance writers. While The X-Files {{had a large}} staff of writers, the staff would occasionally {{have to take a}} risk on a teleplay written by an unaffiliated writer to fill out a full season order. [...] "Sanguinarium" [...] was such a case, being written by sisters Vivian Mayhew and Valerie Mayhew. This marked their first experience with writing a one-hour network program, and they would later write several episodes in {{the television}} series Charmed. Prior to having their script picked up by the series, the sisters asked staff writers Glen Morgan and James Wong for writing suggestions. Morgan and Wong told them that [...] "the scariest things are those which repeat every day". Soon thereafter, Vivian was <b>paged</b> by a number she did not recognize. She realized that pagers in their own way are scary, because an unknown person can connect to the pager's owner. The Mayhews then went from focusing on pagers to the group of people who normally use them: doctors. It was then that they realized a plot about doctors losing control and being bewitched could make for a good episode. After writing their spec script, they presented it to Morgan and Wong, who suggested they change the villain from a woman to a man as [...] "plastic surgery is related to vanity, and everyone expects that from a woman, but not a man." [...] After the script was submitted, it was selected to become a full episode.|$|E

2500|$|BASIC, other {{languages}} and utility ROM chips resided {{in any of}} four 16KB <b>paged</b> ROM sockets, with OS support for sixteen sockets via expansion hardware. The five (total) sockets were located partially obscured under the keyboard, with the leftmost socket hard-wired for the OS. [...] While the original usage for the perforated panel on {{the left of the}} keyboard was for a Serial ROM or Speech ROM, a ZIF socket or edgecard connector could be installed in that location instead. [...] The socket could be connected to one of the empty Sideways/PagedROM sockets via a header cable. The <b>paged</b> ROM system was essentially modular. [...] A language-independent system of star commands, prefixed with an asterisk, provided the ability to select a language (for example *BASIC, *PASCAL), a filing system (*TAPE, *DISC), change settings (*FX, *OPT) or carry out ROM-supplied tasks (*COPY, *BACKUP) from the command line. The MOS recognised a handful of built-in commands, and polled the <b>paged</b> ROMs in descending order for service otherwise; if none of them claimed the command then the OS returned a Bad command error. Connecting an external EPROM programmer, one could write extensive programs, copy to programmable ROM (PROM) or EPROM, then invoke them without taxing user memory.|$|E

2500|$|A memory {{management}} unit (MMU), sometimes called <b>paged</b> {{memory management}} unit (PMMU), is a computer hardware unit having all memory references passed through itself, primarily performing the translation of virtual memory addresses to physical addresses.

Windows/286, {{in spite of its}} name, runs on both Intel 8086 and Intel 80286 processors. It runs in real mode but can make use of the high memory area.|$|E
