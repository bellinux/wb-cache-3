40|$|Abstract This paper {{addresses}} an industrially important {{problem of}} acetic acid recovery from a {{waste water stream}} via reactive distillation.

A good agreement of a <b>phase</b> <b>splitting</b> model with the literature data has been shown.

40|$|Reactive {{distillation}} columns {{that are designed}} to exploit differences in reactivity can exhibit extremely high selectivities for separating close-boiling mixtures. When the reaction product is not needed itself it can be split back. This leads to coupled reactive {{distillation columns}} for reactive separations (see figure). In many such separation systems, olefins are to be separated by performing an addition reaction to a double bond. Whenever this is the case, water is often deemed to be the ideal reactant because of its price, availability and ease of disposal. In some cases the resulting product alcohol is even valued directly as a product. The reaction of water with olefins in a reactive distillation column is difficult however because of the simultaneous liquid-liquid <b>phase</b> <b>splitting.</b> This additional phenomenon makes the simulation of such systems extremely costly with respect to computation time. Also for many systems little experimental data is available on reaction kinetics over the whole range of concentrations including the <b>phase</b> <b>splitting</b> region. Experimental Parameter Identification and Model Validation: An efficient rigorous mathematical model for a reactive distillation column with <b>phase</b> <b>splitting</b> is currently under development at the MPI Magdeburg. As a model reaction the hydration of cyclohexene to cyclohexanol was chosen because of its extreme <b>phase</b> <b>splitting</b> behavior and because cyclohexanol is a valued intermediate in nylon production. To adapt this model to the system under consideration a complete set of thermodynamic and reaction kinetic parameters is needed. For this reason an effort is currently under way to measure such a complete set of data. To measure the necessary parameters a VLE apparatus (FISCHER, 250 Pa - 0. 3 MPa temperatures up to 250 °C), a stirred batch reactor (1. 5 liters, pressure up to 1 MPa, temperatures up to 200 °C) and a continuously operated CSTR (100 ml, pressures up to 6 MPa, temperatures up to 250 °C) have been set up.

40|$|In 2011, Royal Dutch Shell plc (Shell) {{took the}} final {{investment}} decision {{to develop the}} Prelude gas field using the world’s first Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) facility. FLNG poses some new technical challenges. For example, as the vessel is moored to the seabed, it is subject to movements induced by waves, winds and tides. Therefore, flexible instead of rigid risers are used to bring the gas from the seabed to the surface. However, these risers are limited in diameter. For Prelude each flowline is connected to a single riser. In new future projects it might be beneficial to have a single (larger diameter) subsea flowline at the sea floor which is split into two or more flexible risers. This flow split is complicated as gas wells produce a multiphase mixture of gas, hydrocarbon condensates and/or water. There thus {{is a need to}} understand how the different phases will distribute over the multiple risers, and how this will influence the whole operation. In previous lab experiments [1], a horizontal symmetric impacting T-junction was used to divide the multiphase mixture from the horizontal flowline into two vertical risers. It was found that at low gas flow rates, for which the flow regime in the risers is hydrodynamic slug flow, non-symmetric distributions in the <b>phase</b> <b>split</b> are the rule rather than the exception. These maldistributions exhibit transient behaviour, and exhibit hysteresis. However, in gas production from dry fields with low Liquid to Gas Ratios (LGR), the gas flow rates generally are higher and the flow regime in the vertical risers is annular flow. In this flow pattern, liquids flow in the upward direction and no liquid buildup occurs at the riser base. As annular flow is more stable in time, it is expected that for these conditions the <b>phase</b> <b>splits</b> are evenly distributed over the two risers and no transient behaviour is present. The main aim {{of the present study was}} to verify the hypothesis that if the gas flow rate is sufficiently high to sustain annular flow in both risers the phases will distribute evenly. Thereto experiments were performed in the Severe Slugging Loop (SSL) at the Shell Technology Centre Amsterdam. The loop consists of a 100 [m] horizontal flowline connected via an impacting T-junction to two 1. 25 [in] diameter vertical risers of 16. 8 [m] height. The facility is operated with an air-water mixture at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature. As the SSL is not equipped with flow meters to measure the phase flow in the risers, a new method is developed to identify maldistribution in the <b>phase</b> <b>split.</b> In two <b>phase</b> flow in a vertical riser, the flow rates in the pipe are not uniquely determined by the pressure drop. However, in the current dual riser experiments the total flow rate in the setup is known. It is found that, with the use of single riser benchmark data and visual inspection, one can distinguish between an equal and an unequal <b>phase</b> <b>split.</b> Experiments are performed to test the stability of the <b>phase</b> <b>split,</b> and the effect of hysteresis for various gas and liquid flow rate combinations. It is observed that five different states exist for the flow split in the single flowline dual riser geometry. Out of these, only two are stable, which occur on opposite sides of a certain gas flow rate transition point. This point is identified as the minimum in the pressure gradient curve for a single vertical riser. This minimum can be linked to the transition from churn flow to annular flow. In addition to the experiments, a computational model is proposed to predict the <b>phase</b> <b>split.</b> In this model, the Shell Flow Correlations (SFC) for multiphase pipe flow are used to propagate the boundary conditions of the system from the riser tops to the corresponding outlets of the splitter at the base of the risers. Next, all possible <b>phase</b> <b>splits</b> which satisfy the extended Bernoulli equation and the conservation of momentum in the splitter are identified. The model conserves mass implicitly. The extended Bernoulli equation is implemented as the Advanced Double Stream Model (ADSM) [2], the control volume approach is used for the conservation of momentum. All three sub-models assume 1 D steady state fully developed flow in the different parts of the geometry. By imposing different back pressures on the risers, for a constant gas and liquid flow, the model can generate <b>phase</b> <b>split</b> curves. These are compared to experimental data available in the literature and experimental results by Van de Gronden. It is found that the write-up of the derivations in the original ADSM paper [2] contains typos or errors. Therefore we have derived new relations, but they do not exhibit the same behaviour as the modelling results presented in the paper. From the comparison with the experimental results, it is concluded that the proposed computational model, which assumes 1 D steady state fully developed flow, predicts a much too symmetric <b>phase</b> <b>split.</b> The modelling effort has not yet resulted in a reliable for the <b>phase</b> <b>split</b> prediction model.
