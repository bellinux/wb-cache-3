25|$|Many {{personal}} computers of all types, including tablets and mobile phones, use SD cards, either through built-in slots or through an active electronic adaptor. Adaptors {{exist for the}} PC card, ExpressBus, USB, FireWire, and the parallel <b>printer</b> <b>port.</b> Active adaptors also let SD cards be used in devices designed for other formats, such as CompactFlash. The FlashPath adaptor lets SD cards {{be used in a}} floppy disk drive.|$|E
50|$|The early Tandy 1000's used a {{non-standard}} card-edge parallel <b>printer</b> <b>port</b> {{rather than}} industry standard DB-25 <b>printer</b> <b>port.</b> It required a Tandy-1000 compatible printer cable {{to connect to}} a standard printer parallel port.|$|E

50|$|In 1988, {{the only}} {{universal}} connection available on notebook PCs was the <b>printer</b> <b>port,</b> so Xircom devised the Pocket LAN Adapter that {{attached to the}} <b>printer</b> <b>port</b> and connected the notebook PC to a network.

50|$|Two serial ports are {{provided}} on a Quadra 605; one 8-pin Mini-DIN <b>printer</b> <b>port</b> and one 9-pin Mini-DIN modem port {{similar to the}} <b>printer</b> <b>port,</b> but with an extra pin to supply +5 V power from the ADB power supply. Apple recommends no more than 100 mA should be drawn from this pin.|$|E
50|$|The older {{parallel}} <b>printer</b> <b>ports</b> had an 8-bit {{data bus}} and four pins for control output (Strobe, Linefeed, Initialize, and Select In), and five more for control input (ACK, Busy, Select, Error, and Paper Out). Its data transfer speed is at 150 kbit/s.|$|R

50|$|The {{decreasing}} {{cost and}} better performance of integrated circuits {{has led to}} serial links being used in favor of parallel links; for example, IEEE 1284 <b>printer</b> <b>ports</b> vs. USB, Parallel ATA vs. Serial ATA, and FireWire or Thunderbolt are now the most common connectors for transferring data from AV devices such as digital cameras or professional-grade scanners that used to require purchasing a SCSI HBA years ago.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the Zilog Z8000 CPU was popular for desktop sized Unix machines. The onchip MMU reduced {{manufacturing}} cost {{by eliminating the}} need for additional support circuitry required to support virtual memory. These low-cost Unix systems allowed small businesses to run a true multi-user system and share resources (disk, printers) before networking was common. They usually had only RS232 serial ports (4-16) and parallel <b>printer</b> <b>ports</b> instead of built in graphics, as was typical for servers of the time.|$|R

50|$|DECserver 250The DECserver 250 was {{a network}} server for {{printers}} for Ethernet Local Area Networks, {{consisting of a}} single box that provided the following: (2) Digital Parallel <b>printer</b> <b>ports,</b> each of which used a male 37-pin connector, (4) EIA RS-232-C/CCITT V.24 asynchronous line interfaces for connecting three serial printers and one serial printer or terminal, and (1) Ethernet interface transceiver port. The DECserver 250 implemented the Local Area Transport (LAT) protocol for communication with service nodes that implemented this protocol on the same Ethernet. Software that ran on the DECserver 250 was down-line loaded over the network from a Phase IV DECnet load host.|$|R

50|$|After this {{successful}} product, {{the company}} embarked on introducing high-performance add-in cards, {{most notably the}} LIM (Lotus, Intel Microsoft standard) which extended DOS out to 1M, Multi-purpose network cards that included RAM, clock, serial <b>printer</b> <b>ports</b> and Network COAX TCPIP capabilities. Orchid developed its own operating system {{as well as one}} of the first 5 OEM's of Novell. Other products included PC Turbo, TinyTurbo and TurboVGA enhancement cards that included 186 and 286 processors. As the operating systems took on more resources Orchid made a switch back to its roots as PC board manufacturer. From 1984 1986 the company switched to an Autocad video board manufacturer. Later, a variety of memory and video cards were introduced.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s, Centronics {{developed}} the now-familiar <b>printer</b> parallel <b>port</b> that {{soon became a}} de facto standard. Centronics had introduced the first successful low-cost seven-wire print head, which used a series of solenoids to pull the individual metal pins to strike a ribbon and the paper.|$|R
