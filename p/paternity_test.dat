40|$|This article {{reports on}} the {{findings}} of the Swinburne National Technology and Society Monitor in relation to public perceptions of DNA <b>paternity</b> <b>testing,</b> with particular reference to the effects of gender. The Monitor included a large-scale random survey and focus groups. Taken together, the survey and focus groups suggest that most Australians are ‘comfortable’ with DNA <b>paternity</b> <b>testing</b> in a variety of contexts. At the same time, this comfort is qualified, conditional upon the knowledge of all parties. It is also tentative, heavily grounded in the media rather than real-life experience. The survey and focus groups suggest that most men and women do not hold different perceptions of DNA <b>paternity</b> <b>testing.</b> There are several important caveats though. First, the focus groups suggest that reliance upon the media as a source of information leads to a ‘gendered perception’ of DNA <b>paternity</b> <b>testing</b> in terms of ‘paternity fraud’ for both men and women. Second, the survey shows that women are significantly more likely to feel comfortable about DNA <b>paternity</b> <b>testing</b> where all parties have agreed to the test, consistent with a concern to establish paternal responsibility and child support. Finally, the focus groups suggest that having a personal stake in DNA <b>paternity</b> <b>testing</b> generates opinions that are polarised on the basis of gender. The gender dynamics of public perceptions on DNA <b>paternity</b> <b>testing</b> are likely to become more important as the tests become more widespread...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{uses the}} <b>paternity</b> <b>testing</b> {{industry}} {{to explore the}} importance of legitimacy for entrepreneurs {{in the creation of}} new industries. Following Aldrich and Fiol (1994), it distinguishes between cognitive legitimacy whereby entrepreneurs must persuade others of the ‘tangible reality of the new activity’, and sociopolitical legitimacy whereby they must persuade others that it is ‘appropriate and right, given existing norms and laws’. The first wave of entrepreneurs in the <b>paternity</b> <b>testing</b> industry was fundamentally concerned with its cognitive legitimacy. For the most part they were concerned with technical and procedural issues, in order to satisfy their customers in government and law. The fact that government agencies were their main customers made their task much easier. To the extent that cognitive legitimacy was resolved, so was sociopolitical legitimacy. The second wave of entrepreneurs was also concerned with cognitive legitimacy, but in a more complicated way. In extending the market for <b>paternity</b> <b>testing,</b> they established cognitive legitimacy among the wider public through intensive media exposure, but breached the procedural protocols established by the first wave of entrepreneurs. In turn, the new entrepreneurs compromised the sociopolitical legitimacy of <b>paternity</b> <b>testing.</b> In other words, cognitive and sociopolitical legitimacy are not necessarily consistent...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} DNA <b>paternity</b> <b>testing</b> as {{a practiced}} technique {{in shaping the}} lives of children and their families at the attention of statutory child protection services in the State of Queensland, Australia. Currently, this practice activity is invisible and unknown to the Agency Executive and uninformed by legislation, policy or practice guidelines Since the emergence of 2 ̆ 7 new 2 ̆ 7 genetic technologies from the Human Genome Project there has been a subtle, but increasing acceptance of DNA technologies and socially applied techniques such as DNA <b>paternity</b> <b>testing.</b> Grounded within a discourse and community of scientific rationality and universal truth, these techniques and rationalities bring new ways to the meaning made about how we, in contemporary society, live our lives as individuals, families and communities. In identifying an individual‟s unique genetic characteristics and genetic similarity to others, DNA <b>paternity</b> <b>testing</b> may indicate intimate and biological relationships that can alter established understandings of family. Perceived as generating the truth of familial relationships, this DNA technology offers opportunities and future possibilities for civic governance in disciplining and ordering our lives as citizens. In Australia, DNA <b>paternity</b> <b>testing</b> came under scrutiny {{as part of a larger}} public inquiry into the protection of human genetic information. Examined in a range of public and private spheres, the test‟s social application was found to create new challenges and dilemmas for professional and ethical practice. However, its use in child protection, a contentious and highly scrutinised human service practice field, did not come to the Inquiry‟s notice. Children and their families at the attention of government for reasons of child abuse and neglect are subject to professional policy and decision making. Given their dependent status and life experiences, these children are especially vulnerable to the potential impact that agency practices have upon them and their life chances. The uninformed use of DNA <b>paternity</b> <b>testing</b> among this marginalised population group is particularly concerning. This thesis draws upon French philosopher Michel Foucault 2 ̆ 7 s governmentality approach to problematise DNA <b>paternity</b> <b>testing</b> within the unique statutory and disciplinary strategies of child protection services. Perceived as a scientific technique for revealing 2 ̆ 7 truth 2 ̆ 7, DNA <b>paternity</b> <b>testing</b> emphasises Foucault‟s concept of bio-power as 2 ̆ 7 the molecular gaze 2 ̆ 7. Formerly indiscernible, an individual 2 ̆ 7 s genetic characteristics are rendered useful for governing particular and marginalised bodies.
