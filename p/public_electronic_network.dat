40|$|Abstract. Although {{there has}} been a {{significant}} increase in networked communication and a growing interest in technology-supported knowledge management, to date the basic assumption by researchers and practitioners alike has been that individuals value the open sharing of knowledge. However, {{there has been}} little research into what happens when organizations try to promote the open sharing of “secret ” or proprietary knowledge. A theoretical model and set of hypotheses that integrate social network theories with interdependence theory, has been used to illuminate the described case study with a network of communicators in a large global corporate setting. This model suggests that the sharing of an individual’s proprietary knowledge in <b>electronic</b> <b>networks</b> is influenced not only by an individual’s self interest and simple reciprocity but also by the individual’s social and organizational context. Proprietary knowledge exchange within an intra-organizational <b>electronic</b> <b>network</b> focused on discussions of work practice is dependent upon 1) the size of the <b>electronic</b> <b>network</b> 2) the structure of ties that emerge through individual interactions in the <b>electronic</b> <b>network,</b> 3) the relational quality of ties that develop between individuals in the <b>electronic</b> <b>network,</b> 4) the relational ties individuals have with the organization, and 5) the individual attributes extended to the <b>electronic</b> <b>network.</b> This has been shown in a set of corporate stories, relating to the practice, and how it evolves, using a set of emerging technologies to support their practice. 1 A case study on Knowledge Exchange and Internal News flows, with ENOP’s (Communicators...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMany <b>electronic</b> <b>networks,</b> such as forums, provide {{interaction}} spaces where participants {{collaborate on}} complex issues over {{extended periods of}} time. However, while inter- and intra-organizational collaboration has been widely studied, collaboration practices in <b>electronic</b> <b>networks</b> need further investigation. Extant research on <b>electronic</b> <b>networks</b> has mainly emphasized availability of expertise, by focusing on factors such as individual resources and participant diversity. We call for a closer examination of the collaboration practices that allow such expertise to be leveraged for successful outcomes. We argue that an examination of collaboration practices in different technology-enabled contexts {{is essential to the}} study of knowledge work, which increasingly occurs in <b>electronic</b> <b>networks.</b> Therefore, in this paper, we provide a starting point by investigating the structure of collaboration that enables one group to engage in "deep discussion" and sense-making, develop perspectives, and create knowledge. Specifically, in the context of discussion threads, which are the locus of collaboration in many <b>electronic</b> <b>networks,</b> we explore the structure of interaction that leads to effective collaboration. We propose that two dimensions [...] initiating dialogue and sustaining dialogue [...] predict the effectiveness of collaboration in discussion threads. The hypotheses are tested on six months of message data collected from an <b>electronic</b> <b>network</b> focused on methodological issues in the social sciences. We find that the proposed interaction variables contribute to knowledge work over and above the traditional variables that have been studied in the literature such as individual resources and participant diversity...|$|R

40|$|In such growing {{areas as}} remote {{applications}} in large <b>public</b> <b>networks,</b> <b>electronic</b> commerce, digital signature, intellectual property and copyright protection, and even operating system extensibility, the hardware security level offered by existing processors is insufficient. They lack protection mechanisms that prevent the user from tampering critical data owned by those applications. Some devices make exception, {{but have not}} enough processing power nor enough memory {{to stand up to}} such applications (e. g. smart cards). This paper proposes an architecture of secure processor, in which the classical memory management unit is extended into a new security management unit. It allows ciphered code execution and ciphered data processing. An internal permanent memory can store cipher keys and critical data for several client agents simultaneously. The ordinary supervisor privilege scheme is replaced by a privilege inheritance mechanism that is more suited to operating system extensibility. The result is a secure processor that has hardware support for extensible multitask operating systems, and can be used for both general applications and critical applications needing strong protection. The security management unit and the internal permanent memory can be added to an existing CPU core without loss of performance, and do not require it to be modified...|$|R
40|$|We {{employ the}} theory of {{incomplete}} contracts {{to examine the relationship}} between ownership and investment in <b>electronic</b> <b>networks</b> such as the Internet and interorganizational information systems. <b>Electronic</b> <b>networks</b> represent an institutional structure that has resulted from the introduction of information technology in industrial and consumer markets. Ownership of <b>electronic</b> <b>networks</b> is important because it affects the level of network-specific investments, which in turn determine the profitability and in some cases the viability of these networks. In our analysis we define an <b>electronic</b> <b>network</b> as a set of participants and a portfolio of assets. The salient concept in this perspective is the degree to which network participants are indispensable in making network assets productive. We derive three main results: First, if one or more assets are essential to all network participants, then all the assets should be owned together. Second, participants that are indispensable to an asset essential to all participants should own all network assets. Third and most important, in the absence of an indispensable participant, and as long as the cooperation of at least two participants is necessary to create value, sole ownership is never the best form of ownership for an <b>electronic</b> <b>network.</b> This latter result implies that as the leading network participants become more dispensable, we should see an evolution towards forms of joint ownership.

50|$|As {{indicated}} above, {{networks of}} practice incorporate {{a range of}} informal, emergent networks, from communities of practice to <b>electronic</b> <b>networks</b> of practice. In line with Lave & Wenger's original work (1991), Brown & Duguid propose that communities of practice are a localized and specialized subset of networks of practice, typically consisting of strong ties linking individuals engaged in a shared practice who typically interact in face-to-face situations. At {{the opposite end of}} the spectrum are <b>electronic</b> <b>networks</b> of practice, which are often referred to as virtual or electronic communities and consisting of weak ties. In <b>electronic</b> <b>networks</b> of practice, individuals may never get to know one another or meet face-to-face, and they generally coordinate through means such as blogs, electronic mailing lists, or bulletin boards.|$|R
