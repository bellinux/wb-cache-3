50|$|In a {{developed}} capitalism, {{the development}} or {{decline of the}} different branches of production occurs through the continual entry and exit of capital, basically guided by <b>profitability</b> <b>criteria,</b> and {{within the framework of}} competition. Where demand and profits are high, capital moves in, and when demand and profits are low, capital moves elsewhere. Thus, supply and demand are reconciled, however imperfectly, by the incessant migrations of capital across the economy. Yet, Marx argues, this whole process is nevertheless still regulated by the law of value; ultimately, relative price movements for products are still determined by comparative expenditures of labour-time. Thus, market prices for outputs will gravitate towards prices of production which themselves are constrained by product-values expressible in quantities of labour-time.|$|E

Tariffs freely set and revised by Sitarail are applicable one month after their communication, for information, to the governments, and fifteen days after they are publicized. Special contract rates may be negotiated with shippers; these rates are not publicized.Services operated under a specific PSO scheme can be run at the request of one or both national governments, or at the request of local governments under special contracts between the authority requesting the service and Sitarail.

40|$|This PhD thesis {{focuses on}} {{predictive}} analytics {{in a business}} environment. Unlike explanatory modeling, which aims at gaining insight into structural dependencies between variables of interest, the objective of predictive analytics is to construct data-driven models that produce operationally accurate forecasts. Such a predictive analytics tool consists of two components, (1) data-driven models designed to predict future observations and (2) methods to assess the predictive power of such models. This dissertation focuses on a sub domain of predictive analytics: binary classification. Hence, two components are of interest: the classification models themselves, and the classification performance measures. We argue that profitability should be integrated into both components. Furthermore, we propose an approach which looks at benefits and costs, instead of misclassification costs alone. By focusing on benefits (and profit) rather than costs, we are staying closer to the business reality, and aid the adoption of classification techniques in the industry. Therefore, a profit-based classification performance measure is developed and applied to real life business cases. Moreover, an exploratory study on the incorporation of the <b>profitability</b> <b>criterion</b> into the model building step is presented. Finally, this PhD thesis discusses two case studies which clearly demonstrate the usefulness of data analytics in a business context. nrpages: 213 status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In general insurance, the {{expected}} duration of a customer relationship {{is of great}} interest since retaining an existing customer is much cheaper than acquiring a new one from an administrative point of view. The expected acquiring cost of a customer can be spread over all the years a customer is expected to stay as a customer in the insurance company. Hence, a customer with higher expected duration is cheaper for the insurance company than a customer with lower expected duration. The problem with analysing {{the expected}} duration of a customer relationship is the incomplete data. For previous customers {{the duration of the}} customer relationship is known, but for the existing customers only the entry date is known. Because the termination date is still unknown, or censored, {{it is not possible to}} compare these two groups without adjustments being made. Event history analysis is specially made to handle this problem. It is also of interest for an insurance company to evaluate the effects of the variables on the customers. Cox regression is a much applied method for situations like these. This feature enables prioritization of different customers. Such a regression is of interest in itself. But if the expected duration of a customer relationship can be connected to whether or not that customer is profitable, management can set apart the desired customers from the not so desired ones.

Therefore a scenario-analysis is conducted using the EPB-software Flanders and a self-designed Excel file for calculating the most important <b>profitability</b> <b>criteria.</b> Based on these criteria the most profitable combination is determined for a maximum E-level of 80. Using a reference point for three types of dwellings studied, the scenario-analysis shows that for the half-open dwelling the insulation of roof and floor becomes more important whereas for the open dwelling it is the insulation of facade and roof. Further on we can conclude that the EPB-policy should distinguish between the dwelling types and should take on more stringent values for the U-level. ...|$|E
