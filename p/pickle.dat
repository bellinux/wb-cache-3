5|$|The word kosher is {{also part}} of some common product names. Sometimes it is used as an {{abbreviation}} of koshering, meaning the process for making something kosher; for example, kosher salt is a form of salt with irregularly shaped crystals, making it particularly suitable for preparing meat according to the rules of kashrut, because the increased surface area of the crystals absorbs blood more effectively. At other times it is used as a synonym for Jewish tradition; for example, a kosher dill <b>pickle</b> is simply a <b>pickle</b> made in the traditional manner of Jewish New York City <b>pickle</b> makers, using a generous addition of garlic to the brine, and is not necessarily compliant with the traditional Jewish food laws.|$|E

5|$|As the {{traditional}} method of making borscht with beet sour often requires planning {{at least several}} days ahead, many recipes for quicker borscht replace the beet sour with fresh beetroot juice, while the sour taste is imparted by other ingredients, such as vinegar, lemon juice or citric acid, tomatoes, tart apples, dry red wine, dill <b>pickle</b> juice, sauerkraut juice, or a fermented rye flour and water mixture. The soup is typically flavored with {{a wide selection of}} herbs, spices and condiments. Salt, black pepper, garlic, bay leaves and dill are among the most commonly used. Other aromatics often added to borscht include allspice, celery stalks, parsley, marjoram, hot peppers, saffron, horseradish, ginger and prunes. Some recipes require flour or roux to further thicken the borscht. A common opinion is that a good borscht should be thick enough for a spoon to stand upright in it.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage is {{prepared}} and consumed in many ways. The simplest options include eating the vegetable raw or steaming it, though many cuisines <b>pickle,</b> stew, sautée or braise cabbage. Pickling {{is one of}} the most popular ways of preserving cabbage, creating dishes such as sauerkraut and kimchi, although kimchi is more often made from Chinese cabbage (B.rapa). Savoy cabbages are usually used in salads, while smooth-leaf types are utilized for both market sales and processing. Bean curd and cabbage is a staple of Chinese cooking, while the British dish bubble and squeak is made primarily with leftover potato and boiled cabbage and eaten with cold meat. In Poland, cabbage {{is one of the}} main food crops, and it features prominently in Polish cuisine. It is frequently eaten, either cooked or as sauerkraut, as a side dish or as an ingredient in such dishes as bigos (cabbage, sauerkraut, meat, and wild mushrooms, among other ingredients) gołąbki (stuffed cabbage) and pierogi (filled dumplings). Other eastern European countries, such as Hungary and Romania, also have traditional dishes that feature cabbage as a main ingredient. In India and Ethiopia, cabbage is often included in spicy salads and braises. In the United States, cabbage is used primarily for the production of coleslaw, followed by market use and sauerkraut production.|$|E

5|$|Sophie {{was seen}} {{much more in}} The Next Generation. She was the prime {{babysitter}} and target for roving males, particularly Wilson from the Commandos. In an early episode, Sophie climbed a tree in search of caterpillars, but slipped and fell, injuring one of her front paws. The Whiskers moved on, potentially abandoning Sophie, but the injured female managed to limp after them and quickly recovered. Shortly afterwards, Sophie was evicted, for mating with Wilson, by Rocket Dog, who was also pregnant by Wilson. Rocket Dog gave birth to two pups and allowed Sophie to rejoin the group once she aborted her litter. Sophie babysat the two pups, Nugget and Beaker, along with Simon. The babysitters {{decided to take the}} pups foraging, but they ran into the Aztecs and headed for bolt hole. Inside, Simon found a puff adder, but the Whiskers' babysitters couldn't escape due to the Aztecs, they were viciously blocking the entrance. Eventually, the rain forced the Aztecs to retreat, but with it being so late, the babysitters couldn't return to the main burrow. The next day, Sophie reunited the pups with the Whiskers, but Simon had died from a snake bite. Later on in the series, Sophie was evicted by pregnant subordinate female, Wiley Kat. But before long, Wiley Kat was also kicked out by Rocket Dog. In spite of what Wiley Kat had done to her, Sophie stayed with her, and the pair were quickly joined by Wilson and Philippe. During their time together the small family encountered a Genet and Sophie mated with Wilson. But the rovers eventually left. After that, Wiley Kat and her unborn litter simply disappeared, but pregnant Sophie managed to rejoin the Whiskers. She gave birth to three pups named Flashman, <b>Pickle</b> and Chips, and spent her time babysitting Juno. When Rocket Dog was bitten by a Cape cobra, Sophie led the Whiskers to a new burrow, where Rocket Dog eventually met up with them and slowly recovered from her bite. In this season, Sophie was played by Flower's daughter Ella because her other counterparts, Tina Sparkle and Finn were evicted. After Rocket Dog's Death, she became the dominant female of the Whiskers and still retains that position today.|$|E

5000|$|As with <b>pickled</b> cucumbers, {{there are}} {{multiple}} ways of <b>pickling</b> peppers. The most common is as above, <b>pickling</b> in an acidic brine and canned; next is quick-pickled or refrigerator <b>pickling,</b> which skips the canning step and requires the peppers to be stored in the refrigerator as mentioned above. For lacto-fermented <b>pickled</b> peppers, vinegar is omitted from the salty brine; instead, Lactobacilli convert the sugars of the peppers into lactic acid. Such fermented <b>pickled</b> peppers are often used to make hot sauce. At less than 3% acid, fermented <b>pickled</b> peppers are highly perishable if not canned. Sweet <b>pickling</b> with sugar and acid yields [...] "candied" [...] peppers, as for the jalapeños known as [...] "cowboy candy". <b>Pickled</b> peppers are often made into relishes.|$|R

40|$|Background: Anecdotal {{information}} {{has suggested that}} sodium benzoate is used with more than permissible doses during production steps of food products especially <b>pickles</b> and <b>pickled</b> cucumbers in food producing factories in Markazi province and other food producing factories. The present study was done to evaluate factual concentration of sodium benzoate in these products. Methods: In this study, 8 samples from canned <b>pickled</b> cucumbers and 10 samples from canned <b>pickles</b> were randomly gathered from food production factories in Markazi province between March and September 2010. Also, 25 samples from canned <b>pickled</b> cucumbers and 15 samples from canned <b>pickles</b> and 7 samples of bulk cargo <b>pickled</b> cucumbers were collected from the other provinces in Arak city. Sodium benzoate level was determined in the samples using UV-VIS spectrophotometry method. The determined values were analyzed by N-par test using SPSS software version 16. 0. Results: Sodium benzoate level was near zero in the samples of canned <b>pickles</b> and <b>pickled</b> cucumbers from producing factories. This was 200 - 400 PPM in 7 samples from bulk cargo <b>pickled</b> cucumbers which was higher than permissible dose. There was not {{a statistically significant difference}} between mean benzoate level of canned <b>pickles</b> and <b>pickled</b> cucumbers produced in Markazi providence factories and other food factories. Benzoate level was significantly higher than permissible dose in bulk cargo <b>pickled</b> cucumbers. Conclusion: Food products from production factories do not have higher than permissible level of sodium benzoate; however, this is higher in bulk cargo <b>pickled</b> cucumbers. Hence, stricter control on bulk cargo <b>pickled</b> cucumber products is recommended. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pickling</b> of {{oxidised}} 304 {{stainless steel}} in single or multiple electrolytes was investigated based on weight loss and corrosion potential measurements. A smooth surface finish was obtained after an extended <b>pickling</b> in HCl, but some external oxide scales remained. On <b>pickling</b> in HF, the external oxide scales were fully removed, but internal oxide scales remained, and intergranular corrosion took place. Multi-step <b>pickling</b> in successive HCl and HF electrolytes allowed achieving a smooth surface finish free of any oxide scales. The sequence and duration of <b>pickling</b> steps in such multi-step <b>pickling</b> greatly influenced the final surface finish. Corrosion potential of oxidised stainless steel in both electrolytes could differ, and that difference leaded to a uniform <b>pickling</b> of stainless steel in HCl and a localised <b>pickling</b> in HF.
