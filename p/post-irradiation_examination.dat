40|$|Abstract. Historically, uranium enriched to> 90 % 235 U {{has been}} used for many {{peaceful}} applications requiring high fission densities such as driver fuels for research reactors. However, the use of high-enriched uranium or HEU (all enrichments> 20 % 235 U are considered HEU) for civil applications, is considered a proliferation concern. Since the 1970 's, efforts are being devoted to the conversion of research reactors operating on HEU to alternative fuels using uranium with enrichment below 20 % or LEU. These efforts imply the development of high-density LEU fuels to replace the low volume-density (mostly) UAlx based HEU fuels. The paper updates the present status of these developments focusing on the UMo dispersion fuel. It aims to provide an overview of the knowledge generated and the lessons learned in roughly 15 years of UMo dispersion fuel R&D in Europe through irradiation experiments and <b>post-irradiation</b> <b>examinations</b> (PIE) ...|$|R

Both nondestructive and destructive <b>post-irradiation</b> <b>examination</b> on all eleven rods was planned under the Tritium Target Development Program.

Here, we have irradiated B 4 C samples with 4 MeV Au ions with different fluences at room temperature. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman spectroscopy have been performed. The Raman analyses show a high structural disorder at low fluence, around 10 − 2 displacements per atoms (dpa). However, the TEM observations show that the material remains crystalline up to a few dpa. At high fluence, small amorphous areas a few nanometers large appear in the damaged zone but the long range order is preserved. Moreover, the size and density of the amorphous zones do not significantly grow when the damage increases. On the other hand, full amorphisation is observed in the implanted zone at a Au concentration of about 0. 0005.

A total of 40 teeth with cervical exposure were treated in 4 sessions. They were divided into 2 groups according to treatment.

40|$|The central {{aspect of}} the safety {{philosophy}} for a small HTR is the retention of fission products, particularly those of the iodine nuclides, in the fuel elements during operation and accidents. The HFR-P 4 and SL-P 1 experiments were intended to test the performance limits of the LEU TRISO particle during irradiation. Due to the low heavy metal contamination of modern fuel elements, fission gas (I, Sr,Cs) release {{is dominated by the}} number of defective coated particles. For this reason, the determination of the number of damaged particles was the central objective of measuring the fission gas releases in the reactor and in the extensive <b>post-irradiation</b> <b>examinations.</b> Although the values for burnup, fast neutron fluence and irradiation temperature envisaged in an HTR-MODUL were clearly exceeded, it became apparent that of a total of 78, 400 particles employed, only one was defective (i. e. not gastight) during irradiation. In which connection, the damage probably occurred before irradiation, at the end of pre-activation treatment. Two further incidences of particle damage probably occurred during shutdown of the HFR-P 4 experiment.

Indeed, the fuel composition, with high concentrations (up to 50 %) of Minor Actinides and plutonium, results in significant production of helium during irradiation as well as high gamma, neutron emissions and heat in fabrication and handling stages. Studies on fuel development within the European project EUROTRANS, motivated by assessing the industrial practicability for actinides transmutation, have provided a wide range of results.

Fuel performance and safety of preliminary core designs for a prospective 400 MWth transmuter: the European Facility for Industrial Transmutation, were evaluated to support the project.

The U-Zr alloys were irradiated with 140 -keV He+ ions with fluences ranged from 1 × 1014 ions/cm 2 to 5 × 1016 ions/cm 2. Several larger spherical bubbles (<∼ 70 nm) were revealed from an irradiated single α-U phase alloy (U- 0. 1 Zr) in which observed bubbles were mobile under 200 -keV electron beam of transmission electron microscope (TEM). In-situ mergence and leakage of the bubbles in the uranium-rich alloy was also evident during the observation.

This study may reaffirm higher radiation-susceptibility of the α-U phase than the δ-UZr 2 phase, which could strengthen the needs of separate accounting of solid phase effects for metallic fuel performance modeling particularly regarding the fuel restructuring phenomena, such as fission gas swelling and constituent redistribution, since conventional models are commonly adopted homogeneous medium assumption, not {{in accordance with the}} results of <b>post-irradiation</b> <b>examinations</b> of used metallic nuclear fuel in which the formation of several concentric phase zone was distinct corresponding to a steep radial temperature gradient in the fuel pin and multiple isotherm lines in the binary phase diagram of U-Zr alloy system. clos...|$|R
