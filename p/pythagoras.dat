5|$|According to Pausanias {{he was the}} son of Diotimus. Ancient {{commentators}} mention {{an association}} between Milo and the philosopher <b>Pythagoras,</b> who lived at or near Croton for many years. Commentators may have confused the philosopher with an athletic trainer, <b>Pythagoras</b> of Samos, but it is also possible the trainer and the philosopher were the same person.|$|E
5|$|The Romans {{launched}} {{an assault on}} Sparta and took the walls, but their advance was initially impeded by the narrowness of the roads in the city's outskirts. However, the streets grew wider as they advanced into the city's center, and the Spartans were forced further and further back. Nabis, seeing his defenses collapsing, tried to flee, but <b>Pythagoras</b> rallied the soldiers and ordered them to {{set fire to the}} buildings closest to the walls. Burning debris was thrown on the coalition's soldiers entering the city, causing many casualties. Observing this, Flamininus ordered his forces to withdraw to their base. When the attack was renewed later, the Spartans managed to hold off the Roman assaults for three days before Nabis, seeing that the situation was hopeless, decided to send <b>Pythagoras</b> with an offer of surrender. At first, Flaminius refused to see him, but when <b>Pythagoras</b> came to the Roman camp a second time Flamininus accepted the surrender, with the conditions of the treaty being the same as Flamininus had previously proposed. The treaty was later ratified by the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Various {{mechanisms}} {{for such a}} transmission of knowledge have been conjectured including <b>Pythagoras</b> traveling as far as India; Indian philosophers visiting Athens and meeting Socrates; Plato encountering the ideas when in exile in Syracuse; or, intermediated through Persia.|$|E
5|$|Several {{scholars}} have recognised {{parallels between the}} philosophy of <b>Pythagoras</b> and Plato {{and that of the}} Upanishads, including their ideas on sources of knowledge, concept of justice and path to salvation, and Plato's allegory of the cave. Platonic psychology with its divisions of reason, spirit and appetite, also bears resemblance to the three gunas in the Indian philosophy of Samkhya.|$|E
5|$|An early {{structural}} {{application of}} the Pythagorean tiling appears {{in the works of}} Leonardo da Vinci, who considered it among several other potential patterns for floor joists. This tiling has also long been used decoratively, for floor tiles or other similar patterns, as can be seen for instance in Jacob Ochtervelt's painting Street Musicians at the Doorway of a House (1665). It has been suggested that seeing a similar tiling in the palace of Polycrates may have provided <b>Pythagoras</b> with the original inspiration for his theorem.|$|E
5|$|During {{the siege}} at Gythium, <b>Pythagoras</b> had joined Nabis at Sparta, {{bringing}} with him 3,000 men from Argos. When Nabis discovered that Gythium had surrendered {{he decided to}} send an envoy to Flamininus to open negotiations on {{the terms of a}} peace. Nabis offered to withdraw the rest of his garrison from Argos and to hand over to the Romans any deserters and prisoners. Flamininus called another war council. Most of the council felt that they should capture Sparta and unseat Nabis.|$|E
5|$|Nabis had {{appointed}} his brother-in-law, the Argive <b>Pythagoras,</b> {{as commander}} of his garrison of 15,000 men in Argos. As the Romans and the Achaean League were advancing towards the city, a young Argive named Damocles attempted {{to stir up}} a revolution against the Spartan garrison. With a few followers, {{he stood in the}} city's agora and shouted to his fellow Argives, exhorting them to rise in revolt. However, no mass uprising materialized and Damocles and most of his followers were surrounded and killed by the Spartan garrison.|$|E
5|$|Patterns {{in nature}} are visible regularities of form {{found in the}} natural world. These {{patterns}} recur in different contexts and can sometimes be modelled mathematically. Natural patterns include symmetries, trees, spirals, meanders, waves, foams, tessellations, cracks and stripes. Early Greek philosophers studied pattern, with Plato, <b>Pythagoras</b> and Empedocles attempting to explain order in nature. The modern understanding of visible patterns developed gradually over time.|$|E
5|$|Pliny {{addresses}} {{magic in}} Book XXX. He {{is critical of}} the Magi, attacking astrology, and suggesting that magic originated in medicine, creeping in by pretending to offer health. He names Zoroaster of Ancient Persia {{as the source of}} magical ideas. He states that <b>Pythagoras,</b> Empedocles, Democritus and Plato all travelled abroad to learn magic, remarking that it was surprising anyone accepted the doctrines they brought back, and that medicine (of Hippocrates) and magic (of Democritus) should have flourished simultaneously {{at the time of the}} Peloponnesian War.|$|E
5|$|The {{algorithm}} {{was probably}} not discovered by Euclid, who compiled results from earlier mathematicians in his Elements. The mathematician and historian B. L. van der Waerden suggests that Book VII derives from a textbook on number theory written by mathematicians {{in the school of}} <b>Pythagoras.</b> The algorithm was probably known by Eudoxus of Cnidus (about 375 BC). The algorithm may even pre-date Eudoxus, judging from the use of the technical term ἀνθυφαίρεσις (anthyphairesis, reciprocal subtraction) in works by Euclid and Aristotle.|$|E
5|$|Hippocrates is {{credited}} with being {{the first person to}} believe that diseases were caused naturally, not because of superstition and gods. Hippocrates was credited by the disciples of <b>Pythagoras</b> of allying philosophy and medicine. He separated the discipline of medicine from religion, believing and arguing that disease was not a punishment inflicted by the gods but rather the product of environmental factors, diet, and living habits. Indeed {{there is not a single}} mention of a mystical illness in the entirety of the Hippocratic Corpus. However, Hippocrates did work with many convictions that were based on what is now known to be incorrect anatomy and physiology, such as Humorism.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{investigation}} {{has resulted in}} several culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet. In the West, belief in a flat Earth was displaced {{by the idea of}} spherical Earth, credited to <b>Pythagoras</b> in the 6th century BC. Earth was further believed {{to be the center of}} the universe until the 16th century when scientists first theorized that it was a moving object, comparable to the other planets in the Solar System. Due to the efforts of influential Christian scholars and clerics such as James Ussher, who sought to determine the age of Earth through analysis of genealogies in Scripture, Westerners before the 19th century generally believed Earth to be a few thousand years old at most. It was only during the 19th century that geologists realized Earth's age was at least many millions of years.|$|E
5|$|The pre-Socratic Greek {{philosophers}} and Indian philosophers developed {{some of the}} earliest philosophical concepts of the Universe. The earliest Greek philosophers noted that appearances can be deceiving, and sought to understand the underlying reality behind the appearances. In particular, they noted the ability of matter to change forms (e.g., ice to water to steam) and several philosophers proposed that all the physical materials in the world are different forms of a single primordial material, or arche. The first to do so was Thales, who proposed this material to be water. Thales' student, Anaximander, proposed that everything came from the limitless apeiron. Anaximenes proposed the primordial material to be air on account of its perceived attractive and repulsive qualities that cause the arche to condense or dissociate into different forms. Anaxagoras proposed the principle of Nous (Mind), while Heraclitus proposed fire (and spoke of logos). Empedocles proposed the elements to be earth, water, air and fire. His four-element model became very popular. Like <b>Pythagoras,</b> Plato believed that all things were composed of number, with Empedocles' elements taking the form of the Platonic solids. Democritus, and later philosophers—most notably Leucippus—proposed that the Universe is composed of indivisible atoms moving through void (vacuum), although Aristotle did not believe that to be feasible because air, like water, offers resistance to motion. Air will immediately rush in to fill a void, and moreover, without resistance, it would do so indefinitely fast.|$|E
25|$|Much {{of what we}} {{know about}} Pythagoras's life comes from Neoplatonist writers. These writers {{believed}} in the Greek gods, so many myths exist around <b>Pythagoras.</b> Myths about <b>Pythagoras</b> include: Apollo was his father, <b>Pythagoras</b> gleamed with a supernatural brightness, <b>Pythagoras</b> had a golden thigh, Abaris once flew to him on a golden arrow, and <b>Pythagoras</b> was seen in different places at the same time. According to Sir William Smith, {{with the exception of a}} few remarks by Xenophanes, Heraclitus, Herodotus, Plato, Aristotle, and Isocrates, we are mainly dependent on Diogenes Laërtius, Porphyry, and Iamblichus for biographical details. Burkert (1972, p.109) states that Aristoxenus and Dicaearchus are the most important accounts.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pythagoras</b> {{became the}} subject of {{elaborate}} legends surrounding his historic persona. Aristotle described <b>Pythagoras</b> as a wonder-worker and somewhat of a supernatural figure, attributing to him such aspects as a golden thigh, which he showed to Abaris, the Hyperborean priest, and exhibited in the Olympic games. According to Muslim tradition, <b>Pythagoras</b> was said to have been initiated by Hermes (Egyptian Thoth).|$|E
25|$|<b>Pythagoras</b> {{set up an}} {{organisation}} {{which was}} in some ways a school, in some ways a brotherhood (and here {{it should be noted}} that sources indicate that as well as men there were many women among the adherents of <b>Pythagoras),</b> and in some ways a monastery. It was based upon the religious teachings of <b>Pythagoras</b> and was very secretive. The adherents were bound by a vow to <b>Pythagoras</b> and each other, for the purpose of pursuing the religious and ascetic observances, and of studying his religious and philosophical theories. There is mentioning of an oath on the Tetractys.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pythagoras</b> was {{the first}} person known to have taught the earth was spherical, with {{antipodes}} and that it revolved around the sun. <b>Pythagoras</b> was also said to have spread the seeds of political liberty to Crotona, Sybaris, Metapontum, Rhegium, Sicily, Tauromenium, Catana, Agrigentum and Himera.|$|E
25|$|Heraclides Ponticus {{reports the}} story that <b>Pythagoras</b> claimed that he had lived four {{previous}} lives that he could remember in detail. One of his past lives, as reported by Aulus Gellius, was as a beautiful courtesan. According to Xenophanes, <b>Pythagoras</b> heard the cry of his dead friend in the bark of a dog.|$|E
25|$|There {{is little}} direct {{evidence}} {{as to the}} kind and amount of knowledge which <b>Pythagoras</b> acquired, or as to his definite philosophical views. Everything of the kind mentioned by Plato and Aristotle is attributed not to <b>Pythagoras,</b> but to the Pythagoreans. Heraclitus stated {{that he was a}} man of extensive learning; and Xenophanes claimed that he believed in the transmigration of souls. Xenophanes mentions the story of his interceding on behalf of a dog that was being beaten, professing to recognise in its cries the voice of a departed friend. <b>Pythagoras</b> is supposed to have claimed that he had been Euphorbus, the son of Panthus, in the Trojan war, as well as various other characters, a tradesman, a courtesan, etc. In his book The Life of Apollonius of Tyana, Philostratus wrote that <b>Pythagoras</b> knew not only who he was himself, but also who he had been.|$|E
25|$|Greek {{mathematics}} {{is thought to}} have begun with Thales of Miletus (c. 624–c.546 BC) and <b>Pythagoras</b> of Samos (c. 582–c. 507 BC). Although the extent of the influence is disputed, they were probably inspired by Egyptian and Babylonian mathematics. According to legend, <b>Pythagoras</b> traveled to Egypt to learn mathematics, geometry, and astronomy from Egyptian priests.|$|E

25|$|Apuleius, {{following}} Aristoxenus, {{writes about}} <b>Pythagoras</b> in Apologia, c. 150 AD, including {{a story of}} his being taught by Zoroaster—a story also found in Clement of Alexandria.|$|E
25|$|Only a few {{relevant}} {{source texts}} deal with <b>Pythagoras</b> and the Pythagoreans, most {{are available in}} different translations. Other texts usually build solely on information in these works.|$|E
25|$|Diophantus is {{also known}} to have written on {{polygonal}} numbers, a topic {{of great interest to}} <b>Pythagoras</b> and Pythagoreans. Fragments of a book dealing with polygonal numbers are extant.|$|E
25|$|Several {{names of}} theorists are known before these works, {{including}} <b>Pythagoras</b> (c. 570 – c. 495 BCE), Philolaus (c. 470 – c. 385 BCE), Archytas (428–347 BCE), and others.|$|E
25|$|Frequency ratios: with {{ratios of}} lower simple numbers being more {{consonant}} {{than those that}} are higher (<b>Pythagoras).</b> Many of these definitions do not require exact integer tunings, only approximation.|$|E
25|$|Ancient Greek {{philosophy}} {{has a long}} tradition of vegetarianism. <b>Pythagoras</b> was reportedly vegetarian (and studied at Mt. Carmel, where some historians say there was a vegetarian community), as his followers were expected to be.|$|E
25|$|The first {{systematic}} {{study of}} numbers as abstractions is usually credited to the Greek philosophers <b>Pythagoras</b> and Archimedes. Some Greek mathematicians treated the number1 differently than larger numbers, sometimes even {{not as a}} number at all.|$|E
25|$|The Dacian priestly class {{may have}} {{influenced}} the druids of the Celts with the important Christian author Hippolytus of Rome (170236 AD), claiming that the druids adopted the teachings of <b>Pythagoras</b> through the intermediacy of Zalmoxis.|$|E
25|$|While {{the ancient}} Egyptians empirically {{discovered}} some truths of geometry, the great {{achievement of the}} ancient Greeks was to replace empirical methods by demonstrative proof. Both Thales and <b>Pythagoras</b> of the Pre-Socratic philosophers seem aware of geometry's methods.|$|E
25|$|Justin Martyr (c. 105 – c. 165) used Greek {{philosophy}} as the stepping-stone to Christian theology. The mystical conclusions that some Greeks arrived at, pointed to Christ. He was Influenced by: <b>Pythagoras,</b> Plato, Aristotle {{as well as}} Stoicism.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pythagoras</b> {{held that}} {{all things are}} number, and the cosmos comes from {{numerical}} principles. The physical world of becoming is an imitation of the mathematical world of being. This ideas were very influential in Heraclitus, Parmenides and Plato.|$|E
25|$|While the theorem {{that now}} {{bears his name}} was known and {{previously}} utilised by the Babylonians and Indians, he, or his students, are often said to have constructed the first proof. It must, however, be stressed that {{the way in which}} the Babylonians handled Pythagorean numbers implies that they knew that the principle was generally applicable, and knew some kind of proof, which has not yet been found in the (still largely unpublished) cuneiform sources. Because of the secretive nature of his school and the custom of its students to attribute everything to their teacher, there is no evidence that <b>Pythagoras</b> himself worked on or proved this theorem. For that matter, there is no evidence that he worked on any mathematical or meta-mathematical problems. Some attribute it as a carefully constructed myth by followers of Plato over two centuries after the death of <b>Pythagoras,</b> mainly to bolster the case for Platonic meta-physics, which resonate well with the ideas they attributed to <b>Pythagoras.</b> This attribution has stuck down the centuries up to modern times. The earliest known mention of Pythagoras's name in connection with the theorem occurred five centuries after his death, in the writings of Cicero and Plutarch.|$|E
25|$|Both Iamblichus and Porphyry give {{detailed}} {{accounts of}} the organisation of the school, although the primary interest of both writers is not historical accuracy, but rather to present <b>Pythagoras</b> as a divine figure, sent by the gods to benefit humankind.|$|E
