40|$|Background: Cutaneous Leishmaniasis {{is one of}} the endemic {{diseases}} in Bushehr Province, which its prevalence has increased in some districts, as well as Bushehr district recently. This is essential to access minute information about epidemiology of diseases (Parasite, Vector, Reservior), in order to achieve effective control of disease. One of the basic information in respect of controlling measures, is the knowledge and information of fauna and monthly activities of vectors which is essential, because ignoring of different biological aspects of vectors, could cause failure to control strategies. Methods: This is a descriptive- cross sectional study, carried out in four villages of Bushehr district (2007 - 2008) which were affected by cutaneous Leishmaniasis. Sand flies were collected by standard sticky traps, and identified by electric microscope, using reliable identification keys. Results: Sixteen species. (six Phelebotomus and ten Sergentomyia) were identified from a total of 15952 sand flies caught for this study, out of which eight species are reported {{for the first time in}} Bushehr district, namely: Phelobotomus mongolensis, P. caucasicus, P. ansari, Sergentomyia tiberiadis, S. clydei, S. antenata, S. iranica, S. palestiensis.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of atmospheric SW-radiative forcing and local heating/cooling rate is made using a one year temporal and vertical profiles of aerosol and cloud over Yaoundé (11. 51 ° E, 3. 83 ° N). It {{appears that the}} direct influence of aerosols on the surface compared to the TOA can be 3 times larger. Annual mean value obtained at 559 mb altitude is + 27. 74 W/m 2 with range from 0 to + 43 W/m 2. At 904 mb, we obtained an annual mean of ﹣ 46. 22 W/m 2 with range from ﹣ 65 to ﹣ 9 W/m 2. Frequency distribution indicates that more than 95 % of ARF are between + 10 and + 70 W/m 2 at 559 mb (upper limit of UL), and more than 85 % of ARF are between ﹣ 70 and ﹣ 10 W/m 2 at 904 mb (upper limit of PBL). This sign change is {{explained by the fact}} that the backscattering peaks at the upper limit of the aerosol PBL layer. The maximum CRF is noted at TOA where it reaches ﹣ 600 W/m 2 based on the time interval and the structure of clouds. The highest values occur between 11. 50 and 13. 50 LST. Clouds lead to a general heating of the entire atmospheric column with a much greater effect near the surface. Aerosols effect on the heating rate profile show strong cooling during the day for the lower atmosphere, with slight heating at the upper atmosphere. This cooling contribution generally increases from the surface and <b>peacks</b> at the upper boundary of aerosol layer where reflectivity is the most important.

40|$|A {{resonance}} is {{a complex}} number 2 C describing a nonstable quantum state os-cillating with a frequency Re, whose life-time is proportional to 1 =Im. Therefore, the closer a resonance is to the real axis (that is, the smaller its imaginary part is), the longer it lives, and hence the more interesting {{it is from the}} physical point of view. In the physical experiments the real parts of the resonances are observed as the points at which the rst derivative, s 0 (), of the phase s(); 2 R, of the scattering matrix has <b>peacks.</b> The knowledge of the resonances near the real axis also enables us to deduce important information about the decay of the local energy of the solutions of the wave equation.

The cyclophosphamide is not stage-dependent, as it acts in all the stages of the cell cycle, its mutagen effect being accompanied also by a cell cycle stopping (Paşca C., Crăciun C., Ardelean A. 2000).

While their handling were increasing in both volume and value, fish landing and distribution were pursued under the government control {{the same as that}} in fishing activity. (2) 1951 - 1954 : By resolving govenment control system, free fish trade in the market were revived. Middle-wholesalers and fish retailers came back to the previous jobs where they were dealing with the real demand. Fish handling were increasing continuously due to the increase of fish landings. Nagasaki Prefectural Fisheries Co-operative Association tried to establish another fish market in Nagasaki, but it was failed later {{due to the lack of}} capital and the irregularity of poor catch of purse-seine fisheries which supposed to be their main support. (3) 1955 - 1964 : With expansion of fishing ground and fish consumption, Nagasaki Fish Market was further growing. The displacement of the market location encouraged this situation and therefore, their handling in volume reached a <b>peack</b> in 1960. However it turned to decrease because of the variation of resources and use of alternative fish handling ports besides Nagasaki. Finally this paper examines the comparison of Nagasaki Fish Market with other nearby fish markets. As there was a wide range of fisheries and expansion of fishing ground, the fishermen began to choose the fish landing place. Nagasaki Fish Market has advantage and disadvantage in location as it is near fishing grounds but far away from big consuming areas, resulting in low price formation. Another characteristics of Nagasaki Fish Market is that more than half of landed fish are sent directly to big cities without auction within its market...|$|E
40|$|Aspergillus niger - 245, {{a strain}} {{isolated}} from soil samples showed good &# 946;-fructosidase activity when inoculated in medium formulated with dahlia extract tubers. The enzyme was purified by precipitation in ammonium sulphate and percolated in DEAE-Sephadex A- 50 and CM-cellulose columns, witch showed a single <b>peack</b> {{in all the}} purification steps, maintaining the I/S ratio between 0. 32 to, 0. 39. Optimum pH for inulinase activity (I) was between 4. 0 - 4. 5 and for invertase activity (S) between 2. 5 and 5. 0. The optimum temperature was 60 O. C for both activities and no loss in activity was observed when it was maintained at this temperature for 30 min. The Km value was 1. 44 and 5. 0, respectively, for I and S and Vm value 10. 48 and 30. 55, respectively. The I activity was strongly inhibited by Hg 2 + and Ag+ and 2 x 10 - 3 M of glucose, but not by fructose at the same concentration. The enzyme showed an exo-action mechanism, acting on the inulin of different origins. In assay conditions total hydrolysis of all the frutans was obtained, although it has shown larger activity on the chicory inulin than that one from artichoke Jerusalem and dahlia, in the first 30 min. The obtained results suggested that the enzyme presented good potential for industrial application in the preparing the fructose syrups Aspergillus niger - 245, isolado do solo mostrou boa atividade de b-frutosidase meio formulado com extrato de tubérculos de dahlia. A enzima foi purificada por precipitação em sulfato de amônia e percolada em colunas de DEAE-Sephadex A- 50 e CM-celulose, produzindo um único pico em todas as fases de purificação e mantendo a relação I/S entre 0, 32 a 0, 39. O pH ótimo para a atividade de inulinase (I) foi encontrado entre 4, 0 - 4. 5 e para a atividade de invertase (S) em 2, 5 e 5, 0. A temperatura ótima foi de 60 O. C para ambas as atividades e nenhuma perda foi observada quando mantida nesta temperatura por 30 min. Os valores de Km foram de 1, 44 e 5, 0, respectivamente, para I e S e os valores de Vm de 10, 48 e 30, 55, respectivamente. A atividade I foi fortemente inibida por Hg 2 +, Ag+ e 2 x 10 - 3 M de glicose, mas não por frutose na mesma concentração. A enzima mostrou um mecanismo de exo-ação, atuando sobre a inulina de diferentes origens. Em condições de ensaio foi obtida hidrólise total de frutanas, apesar de ter mostrado maior atividade sobre a inulina de chicória que sobre as de alcachofra de Jesrusalém e dahlia, nos primeiros 30 minutos de reação. Os resultados obtidos sugerem que a enzima apresenta bom potencial para aplicações industriais na preparação de xaropes de frutose...|$|E
