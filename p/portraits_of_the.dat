5|$|During {{the years}} 1925–35, Jolin's style is {{characterized}} by light, soft, grey notes and pastels. Later on, still life featuring Oriental porcelain, preferably displayed on a reflecting mahogany tabletop, became a more common motif. He also painted numerous <b>portraits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Swedish socialites at that time.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s he {{returned}} to art producing religious paintings and portraits. He stated that everybody {{has a right to}} have a portrait so he agreed to work for whatever low commission the subject could afford. Among his <b>portraits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time was his famous , a portrait of Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin and many others.|$|E
5|$|Room of Castagnoli: {{named after}} the painter of the ceiling frescoes. In this room are exposed <b>Portraits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Medici and Lorraine ruling families, and the Table of the Muses, a masterwork of stone-inlaid table {{realized}} by the Opificio delle Pietre Dure between 1837 and 1851.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{arrangement}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> figures {{is greatly}} influenced by Van Dyck's <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family <b>of</b> King Charles I and by Honthorst's <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Buckingham family.|$|R
50|$|His {{two best}} known {{pictures}} are a full-length <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mohawk chief Thayendanegea (Joseph Brant) (c. 1805) {{and a group}} <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Woolsey Family (1809).|$|R
50|$|<b>Portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sculptor Jens Adolf Jerichau, the Artist's Husband is a <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Danish {{sculptor}} Jens Adolf Jerichau {{painted in}} 1846 by Elisabeth Jerichau-Baumann, {{the same year}} they married.|$|R
5|$|Several formal {{images from}} his pre-war service with the Royal Family {{are held by}} the National Portrait Gallery, {{including}} several from the Delhi Durbar {{as well as a}} portrait of Prince Arthur of Connaught and Princess Alexandra, taken at their wedding. Two <b>portraits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> young Prince John, both in 1913.|$|E
5|$|After {{collapsing}} at a House of Lords dinner, Thatcher, having suffered low blood pressure, {{was admitted}} to St Thomas' Hospital in central London on 7 March 2008 for tests. In 2009 she was hospitalised again when she fell and broke her arm. Thatcher returned to 10 Downing Street in late November 2009 for the unveiling of an official portrait by artist Richard Stone, an unusual honour for a living ex-Prime Minister. Stone previously painted <b>portraits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Queen and the Queen Mother.|$|E
5|$|At {{around this}} time Etty began to receive many {{unsolicited}} letters from wealthy Old Etonian lawyer Thomas Myers. Myers was a huge admirer of Etty, and his letters mainly suggest literary topics he felt Etty ought to be painting so as {{to appeal to the}} nobility; he wrote regularly between July 1832 and May 1844. Although eccentric and largely incoherent (one of his suggestions was for Etty to raise his profile by painting nude <b>portraits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wives of the aristocracy), Etty appears to have taken at least some of Myers's suggestions seriously.|$|E
50|$|It is {{therefore}} {{more likely that}} <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead 'son' which introduced Raeburn in Belgian High Society was <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> son <b>of</b> Mr. Marshall and not of Madame Duchateau.|$|R

50|$|The Picture Gallery {{is another}} {{original}} interior room. On {{the walls are}} paintings of governors and hospital officials through the ages. These portraits include Allan Ramsay’s <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> Dr Richard Mead, Reynolds’s <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earl <b>of</b> Dartmouth, and Thomas Hudson’s <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hospital’s architect, Theodore Jacobsen.|$|R
5|$|Burial 116 is {{the tomb}} of Jasaw Chan K'awiil I. It is a large vaulted chamber deep within the pyramid, {{below the level of}} the Great Plaza. The tomb {{contained}} rich offerings of jadeite, ceramics, shell and works of art. The body of the king was covered with large quantities of jade ornaments including an enormous necklace with especially large beads, as depicted in sculpted <b>portraits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king. One of the outstanding pieces recovered from the tomb was an ornate jade mosaic vessel with the lid bearing a sculpted portrait of the king himself.|$|E
5|$|In December 1888 {{he painted}} La Berceuse – {{a figure that}} he thought {{as good as his}} sunflowers. It has a limited palette, varied brushstrokes and simple contours. It appears to be a {{culmination}} of <b>portraits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roulin family completed in Arles between November and December. The portraits show a shift in style from the fluid, restrained brushstrokes and even surface of Portrait of the Postman to the frenetic style, rough surface, broad brushstrokes and use of a palette knife in Madame Roulin with Baby.|$|E
5|$|Ironically, in {{the next}} year, the Great Fire of London (1666) was to be of benefit to him, when he {{received}} one of the City of London's first new artistic commissions to paint twenty-two full length <b>portraits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> so-called 'Fire Judges' (those appointed to assess the property disputes arising from the fire). These paintings, completed in 1670, hung in London's Guildhall until it was bombed during World War II; today only two (those of Sir Matthew Hale and Sir Hugh Wyndham) remain in the Guildhall Art Gallery the remainder having been destroyed or dispersed.|$|E

500|$|In mid-1833 Etty began a <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> daughters <b>of</b> Charles Watkin Williams-Wynn, the long-serving Conservative Member of Parliament for Montgomeryshire, shown Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball [...] Etty {{was then}} little-known for portraits, but had {{recently}} completed Elizabeth Potts, a <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> daughter <b>of</b> a family friend, which although poorly received by some critics was technically highly accomplished. He {{said at the}} time that he hoped his <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Williams-Wynn children would be [...] "one of my best".|$|R

5|$|Little {{more than}} a year after her birth, Maria Theresa was joined by a sister, Maria Anna, and another one, named Maria Amalia, was born in 1724. The <b>portraits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{imperial}} family show that Maria Theresa resembled Elisabeth Christine and Maria Anna. The Prussian ambassador noted that she had large blue eyes, fair hair with a slight tinge of red, a wide mouth and a notably strong body. Unlike many other members of the House of Habsburg, neither Maria Theresa's parents nor her grandparents were closely related to each other.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{appear in}} art, either to {{illustrate}} their botanical appearance, {{or for the}} purposes of the artist, which may include decoration or religious symbolism. For example, the Virgin Mary was compared by the Venerable Bede to a lily, the white petals denoting purity of body, while the yellow anthers signified the radiant light of the soul; accordingly, European <b>portraits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Virgin's Annunciation may depict a vase of white lilies in her room to indicate her attributes. Plants are also often used as backgrounds or features in portraits, and as main subjects in still lifes.|$|E
5|$|The United States Sesquicentennial coin issue {{consisted}} of a commemorative half dollar and quarter eagle (gold $2.50 piece) struck in 1926 at the Philadelphia Mint for the 150th anniversary of American independence. The obverse of the half dollar features <b>portraits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first president, George Washington, and the president in 1926, Calvin Coolidge, making it the only American coin to depict a president in his lifetime.|$|E

5|$|Coins are {{the only}} items in the Hoxne Hoard for which a {{definite}} date and place of manufacture can be established. All of the gold coins, {{and many of the}} silver coins, bear the names and <b>portraits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emperor in whose reign they were minted. Most also retain the original mint marks that identify where they were minted, illustrating the Roman system of regional mints producing coins to a uniform design. The coins' manufacture has been traced back to a total of 14 sources: Trier, Arles and Lyon (in Gaul), Ravenna, Milan, Aquileia, Rome (in modern Italy); Siscia (modern Croatia), Sirmium (modern Serbia), Thessaloniki (Greece), Constantinople, Cyzicus, Nicomedia, and Antioch (modern Turkey).|$|E
5|$|Fuller painted {{other works}} for the Hacketts. In a 1937 piece {{reflecting}} on early twentieth-century art in Western Australia, a reviewer recalled:Dr. (later Sir Winthrop) Hackett was a great patron of Miss Fuller, {{and he was a}} constant visitor to her dignified studio, above his office in the old West Australian Chambers. The first portrait I saw Miss Fuller working on was of Mrs. E. Chase... The portrait was a commission from Dr. Hackett, and was destined to hang in his gallery. Miss Fuller painted Lady Hackett both before and after her marriage, and one particularly happy picture of her is as a young girl gathering wildflowers in the Darlington hills. Her <b>portraits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first Hackett babies were charming studies of childhood.|$|E
5|$|In 17th-century Spain, {{painters}} rarely enjoyed high social status. Painting {{was regarded}} as a craft, not an art such as poetry or music. Nonetheless, Velázquez worked his way up through the ranks of the court of PhilipIV, and in February 1651 was appointed palace chamberlain (aposentador mayor del palacio). The post brought him status and material reward, but its duties made heavy demands on his time. During the remaining eight years of his life, he painted only a few works, mostly <b>portraits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> royal family. When he painted Las Meninas, he had been with the royal household for 33 years.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, the United States Mint began {{releasing}} {{a set of}} half-ounce $10 gold coins under the First Spouse Program with engravings of <b>portraits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First Ladies on the obverse. When a President served without a spouse, a gold coin is issued that bears an obverse image emblematic of Liberty as depicted on a circulating coin of that era and a reverse image emblematic of themes of that President's life. This {{is true for the}} coins for Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, and James Buchanan's First Ladies, but not the coin for Chester A. Arthur's First Lady, which will instead depict suffragette Alice Paul.|$|E
5|$|Many {{pictures}} {{depict the}} countryside at Wiedensahl and Lüthorst. They include pollarded willows, cottages in cornfields, cowherds, autumn landscapes and meadows with streams. A particular {{feature is the}} use of red jackets, found in about 280 of 1000 Busch paintings and drawings. The muted or bright red coats are worn usually by a small figure, depicted from behind. The paintings generally represent typical villages. <b>Portraits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kesslers, and a series of other portraits depicting Lina Weissenborn in the mid-1870s, are exceptions. A painting of a 10-year-old girl from a Jewish family at Lüthorst portrays her as serious, and having dark, oriental features.|$|E
