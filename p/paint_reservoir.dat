50|$|Paint can be fed {{by gravity}} from a <b>paint</b> <b>reservoir</b> sitting atop the {{airbrush}} (calledgravity feed) or siphoned from a reservoir mounted below (bottom feed) {{or on the}} side (side feed). Each feed type carries unique advantages. Gravity feed instruments require less air pressure for suction as the gravity pulls the paint into the mixing chamber. Typically instruments with the finest mist atomization and detail requirements use this method since less air pressure allows for finer control paint flow and less overspray. Side- and bottom-feed instruments allow the artist {{to see over the}} top, with the former sometimes offering left-handed and right-handed options to suit the artist. A bottom feed airbrush typically holds a larger capacity of paint than the other types, and is often preferable for larger scale work such as automotive applications and tee-shirt design.|$|E

40|$|Utah {{oil fields}} have {{produced}} a total of 1. 2 billion barrels (191 million m{sup 3 }). However, the 15 million barrels (2. 4 million m{sup 3 }) of production in 2000 was the lowest level in over 40 years and continued the steady decline {{that began in the}} mid- 1980 s. The Utah Geological Survey believes this trend can be reversed by providing play portfolios for the major oil producing provinces (Paradox Basin, Uinta Basin, and thrust belt) in Utah and adjacent areas in Colorado and Wyoming. Oil plays are geographic areas with petroleum potential caused by favorable combinations of source rock, migration paths, reservoir rock characteristics, and other factors. The play portfolios will include: descriptions and maps of the major oil plays by reservoir; production and reservoir data; case-study field evaluations; summaries of the state-of-the-art drilling, completion, and secondary/tertiary techniques for each play; locations of major oil pipelines; descriptions of reservoir outcrop analogs; and identification and discussion of land use constraints. All play maps, reports, databases, and so forth, produced for the project will be published in interactive, menu-driven digital (web-based and compact disc) and hard-copy formats. This report covers research activities for {{the first quarter of the}} first project year (July 1 through September 30, 2002). This work included producing general descriptions of Utah's major petroleum provinces, gathering field data, and analyzing best practices in the Utah Wyoming thrust belt. Major Utah oil reservoirs and/or source rocks are found in Devonian through Permian, Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Tertiary rocks. Stratigraphic traps include carbonate buildups and fluvial-deltaic pinchouts, and structural traps include basement-involved and detached faulted anticlines. Best practices used in Utah's oil fields consist of waterflood, carbon-dioxide flood, gas-injection, and horizontal drilling programs. Nitrogen injection and horizontal drilling programs have been successfully employed to enhance oil production from the Jurassic Nugget Sandstone (the major thrust belt oil-producing <b>reservoir)</b> in Wyoming's <b>Painter</b> <b>Reservoir</b> and Ryckman Creek fields. At <b>Painter</b> <b>Reservoir</b> field a tertiary, miscible nitrogen-injection program is being conducted to raise the reservoir pressure to miscible conditions. Supplemented with water injection, the ultimate recovery will be 113 million bbls (18 million m{sup 3 }) of oil (a 68 percent recovery factor over a 60 -year period). The Nugget reservoir has significant heterogeneity due to both depositional facies and structural effects. These characteristics create ideal targets for horizontal wells and horizontal laterals drilled from existing vertical wells. Horizontal drilling programs were conducted in both <b>Painter</b> <b>Reservoir</b> and Ryckman Creek fields to encounter potential undrained compartments and increase the overall field recovery by 0. 5 to 1. 5 percent per horizontal wellbore. Technology transfer activities consisted of exhibiting a booth display of project materials at the Rocky Mountain Section meeting of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, a technical presentation to the Wyoming State Geological Survey, and two publications. A project home page was set up on the Utah Geological Survey Internet web site...|$|R

When the state turned control of the park over to the BLM in 1989, the Lake Unit was closed due to concerns over pollutants in the Gila River and is not maintained by the BLM. Currently, there is no public access to Painted Rock Dam or the Lake Unit.|$|R
50|$|The Dendora Valley is {{only about}} 9 mi long. The Gila Bend Mountains form the {{northern}} border from east to west, of both Dendora Valley, and the <b>Painted</b> Rock <b>Reservoir</b> adjacent eastwards; this is the famous Gila Bend formed by the Gila River as it changes direction to south, then west entering the reservoir. Other small mountains and hills border the southwest, namely Oatman Mountain, at 1732 ft and the Face Mountain group with Montezuma Head, (peak) to the west.|$|R
50|$|The Gila River of New Mexico and Arizona transects {{the entire}} state of Arizona, and the {{watershed}} covers about 65% of Arizona. The famous Gila Bend of the river changes the west-southwest flow to south-flowing, then back to west-flowing. <b>Painted</b> Rock <b>Reservoir</b> and the Dendora Valley are nestled at the south of the Gila Bend Mountains, the monolith which causes the diversion of the Gila Bend. Gila Bend, Arizona is located at the southeast of the bend, on Interstate 8.|$|R

The Gila River crosses all of southern Arizona from southwest New Mexico, and is the drainage for about 1/2 of Arizona (the south).|$|R
50|$|For {{more than}} 40 winter seasons, Norton Allen, {{along with his}} father Ernest and wife Ethel, {{salvaged}} archaeological materials that {{were in danger of}} being destroyed by expanding agricultural projects fed by water from the Gila River. He also conducted small excavations in the San Pedro Valley, southern Utah and southwestern Colorado. It was Allen's work and discoveries, particularly at the Gatlin Site, one of the few documented Hohokam platform mounds, that was the impetus for the excavations in the <b>Painted</b> Rocks <b>Reservoir</b> conducted by Arizona State Museum archaeologists William Wasley and Alfred Johnson from 1959 to 1964.|$|R
50|$|The Sentinel Plain {{is about}} 40 mi long {{and on the}} north-northwest, it borders the Hyder Valley and the farming {{community}} of Hyder on the Gila River. To the northeast is <b>Painted</b> Rock <b>Reservoir</b> and the <b>Painted</b> Rock Mountains. The south and southwest of the Sentinel Plain is bordered by the Crater Range; the east and southeast is bordered by the White Hills, and the Saucedo Mountains. Midway Wash drains {{into the center of}} the plain southeast-northwesterly, but disappears into the ground about 10 miles southeast from the Gila River. The west and southwestern border of the plain contains the northwest-flowing Tenmile Wash-(which also succumbs to ground disappearance, but adjacent to the Gila), and the northwest trending Crater Range.|$|R
50|$|The Bitterroot River {{watershed}} drains 2889 sq mi in Ravalli and Missoula counties. The Bitterroot Valley averages 7-10 {{miles wide}} and is uniquely low gradient for western Montana streams. The river mainstem {{begins at the}} confluence of the East Fork Bitterroot River and the West Fork Bitterroot River. From there the mainstem receives numerous tributaries from the Bitterroot Mountains to the west and the Sapphire Mountains to the east. The watershed is a snowmelt dominated system with large interannual variations in streamflow and peak flows from mid-May to mid-June. The variation is compounded by extensive irrigation withdrawals and upstream <b>reservoir</b> storage at <b>Painted</b> Rocks <b>Reservoir</b> on the West Fork Bitterroot River with the most severely dewatered reaches along 12 mi of the river located between Woodside Crossing near Corvallis and Bell Crossing near Stevensville.|$|R
50|$|The oldest {{preserve}} in the Arc of Appalachia's preserve {{system is}} the Highlands Nature Sanctuary in Highland County, Ohio and Ross County, Ohio. The Highlands Nature Sanctuary is 2200 acres in size and exists to protect the Rocky Fork Gorge, defined as lower ten mile run of the Rocky Fork Creek, beginning at the creek's exit at the Rocky Fork State Park dam, and ending with the creek's confluence with Paint Creek just downstream of the <b>Paint</b> Creek <b>Reservoir</b> dam. The lower Rocky Fork cuts through a dolomite gorge which presents a classic karst landscape of grottos, vertical rock walls and canyons, sinkholes, seeps and springs. Among its visitor services, The Highlands Nature Sanctuary provides hiking trails to the public on weekends from spring through fall at the Appalachian Forest Museum, its main visitor hub.|$|R

The saddle dam is 40 ft high and 3400 ft long. The project also necessitated the construction of an auxiliary spillway, since the main dam's morning glory spillway had not been adequately tested. This auxiliary spillway - [...] known as the [...] "Bent Branch Spillway" [...] after the stream into which it empties - [...] is located about 1.5 mi south of the main dam.|$|R
40|$|The Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation and Drainage District {{occupies}} a valley and adjoining mesa along the lower Gila River, {{in the southwestern}} part of the State of Arizona. The area has been irrigated for centuries, and now shows problems which reflect past and present water management. First, the water supplies came from the Gila River; later, the groundwater reservoir was used and within about 30 years, groundwater levels declined and salt accumulation, {{as a consequence of}} water recirculation, put a limit on attempts to maintain irrigated agriculture. Recently, Colorado River water was brought into the area as the solution to assure permanent large-scale irrigation development. The application of water for crops and leaching of salts caused serious drainage problems. Salinity also caused a problem out of the District as drainage water from the aquifer with high salt content reached the Colorado River and became a source of friction between the United States and Mexico. The water conveyance system in the District is unique in that irrigation water is pumped up the valley into the distribution system. During flood flows along the lower Gila River, this leads to the situation where water is going down the River with little chance to be used, and goes up the valley through a sophisticated conveyance system. Flood flows along the lower Gila River are dependent on infrequent releases from <b>Painted</b> Rock <b>Reservoir,</b> at the upstream boundary of the lower Gila River. The few times they have occurred (2 in 15 years), they created high groundwater levels which were damaging to crop production. The water problems in the District could have short-run solutions through technically possible and economically feasible management practices. The objectives of the study are focused on better use of the water resources, reduction of risks of flood damages, and decrease of salt content of water being diverted to Mexico. A mathematical model was developed to analyze the impact of selected alternatives which could meet these objectives upon the hydrologic system of the District. The application of Strategy I, which proposes the increase of the irrigated acreage by about 5, 000 acres, proved to be impracticable under present management conditions since the amount of drainage water to be disposed would be greater than the capacity of the disposal system. Strategies II, III, and IV, which propose increasing levels of change from flood to sprinkler irrigation (25, 50 and 100 rcent) showed results that although not economically encouraging, provide, however, for solution of the internal water problem of the area, and substantial decrease of drainage flow of high salt content delivered to the Colorado River. Strategies V and VI, which proposed reduction by 50 percent or complete elimination of riparian vegetation also proved to be impracticable. Under present management conditions in the District, phreatophytes are an important auxiliary of the water discharge system of the area. Strategies VII and VIII showed that the combination of changes to sprinkler irrigation and reduction of riparian vegetation at levels proposed (50 and 100 percent) practically counteract each other in terms of drainage water to be pumped and does not achieve the proposed objectives. Change in the water management system of the Wellton-Mohawk District would solve its water problems and significantly reduce salinity of the Colorado River water at Morelos Dam, for which {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} will be expended in a desalting complex. Drainage from excessive irrigation on the mesa flowing into the valley aquifer is the main cause of high groundwater levels there. Riparian vegetation, although increasing flood damages, is indispensable under the present management system...|$|R
