Previous studies have investigated the ability of various treatment planning systems to calculate the dose immediately beyond small <b>air</b> <b>gaps,</b> typically less than 5 cm thick, such as those within the body. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the ability of the Eclipse anisotropic analytical algorithm (AAA) and pencil beam convolution (PBC) algorithm to calculate the dose beyond large <b>air</b> <b>gaps.</b> Depth dose data in water for a 6 MV photon beam, cm² 10 × 10 ² field size, and 100 cm SSD were measured beyond a range of <b>air</b> <b>gaps</b> (1 - 15 cm). The thickness of the water equivalent material positioned before the <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> ranged from 0. 2 to 4 cm. Dose was calculated with the Eclipse PBC algorithm and AAA. The scattered and primary dose components were calculated from the measurements. The measured results indicate that as the <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> increases (from 1 to 15 cm) the dose reduces at the water surface and that beyond an <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> a secondary buildup region is required to re-establish electronic equilibrium. The dose beyond the <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> is also reduced at depths beyond the secondary buildup region. The PBC algorithm did not predict any reduction in dose beyond the <b>air</b> <b>gap.</b> AAA predicted the secondary buildup region but did not predict the reduction in dose at depths beyond it. The reduction in dose beyond the secondary buildup region was shown to be particularly relevant for <b>air</b> <b>gaps</b> of 5 cm or more when there was a 2 cm of water equivalent material positioned before the <b>air</b> <b>gap.</b> For these cases, where electronic equilibrium is established in the material positioned before the <b>air</b> <b>gap,</b> both algorithms were found to overestimate the dose by 2. 0 %- 5. 5 %.

Within the firefighting community, and especially the petroleum and petrochemical industries flash fire {{is one of the}} possible fire hazards for workers. Exposure to flash fire is usually of short duration (a few seconds) until the worker runs away from the fire location. The typical protective clothing system consists of a fire resistant fabric, the human skin, and an <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> between the fabric and skin. The protective performance of the {{clothing is}} evaluated based on the total energy transfer from the fabric to the skin through the <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> causing burn injury to the skin. Therefore the <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> between the protective clothing and skin {{plays an important role in}} determining the protection level provided by the clothing since the energy transfer through the <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> determines the amount of energy received by the skin. The more realistic the analysis of the <b>air</b> <b>gap,</b> the more reliable the evaluation of the protective performance of the clothing. This study introduces a more realistic analysis for the <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> between protective clothing and the skin compared to that found in the literature. More specifically, the study accounts for the combined conduction-radiation heat transfer through the <b>air</b> <b>gap,</b> which was treated as a thermal radiation participating medium with temperature dependent thermophysical properties. A finite volume model was developed to simulate the transient heat transfer in a single layer protective clothing system with radiation heat transfer. The model was employed to investigate the influence of the conduction-radiation heat transfer through the <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> on the overall heat transfer through the protective clothing system and hence on its protective performance. The influence of different protective clothing parameters on the combined conduction-radiation heat transfer through the <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> such as the <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> absorption coefficient, <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> width, fabric thickness, and fabric backside emissivity was studied. A comprehensive study of the influence of a periodic variation in the <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> width and associated inflow of cool air due to the motion of the person wearing the clothing on its protective performance was carried out. A wide range of variation in the frequency and amplitude of the fabric periodic movement was considered to capture different scenarios for the wearer’s motion. Finally, a finite volume model was developed to simulate the transient heat transfer in multiple layers firefighters’ protective clothing. The model considered the combined conduction-radiation heat transfer in the <b>air</b> <b>gaps</b> entrapped between the clothing layers, which were treated as thermal radiation participating media. The influence of each <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> on the overall performance of the clothing was investigated as well. The improved <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> model is a significant improvement for modeling heat transfer in protective clothing. It was used to obtain a more detailed knowledge of the theoretical performance of such clothing, e. g. it was found that reducing the fabric backside emissivity was more effective in improving the clothing protective performance than increasing the fabric thickness. It was also observed that the motion of the person wearing the clothing has a significant effect on the performance of the clothing: an increase in the frequency of the fabric movement improves the protection provided by the clothing, primarily due to the more frequent inflow of cool air, while an increase in the amplitude of the fabric movement reduces the protection provided by the clothing by concentrating the exposure on the skin. Finally, the <b>air</b> <b>gaps</b> entrapped between the clothing layers in firefighters’ protective clothing were found to improve the clothing performance, and the influence of the <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> between the moisture barrier and the thermal liner is greater than that of the <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> between the outer shell and the moisture barrier...|$|R
40|$|Researchers {{have always}} shown keen {{interest}} in predetermining the electromagnetic field behavior inside an electrical machine at the design stage. Material properties of permanent magnet, selection of optimum <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> during the electromagnetic, thermal and structural design of generator {{are considered to be}} vital factors for an ideal machine. Generator output, heat rise, weight, and cost {{are a few of the}} characteristics which are directly influenced by the selection of the most advantageous material properties. Moreover, most theoretical studies have been conducted assuming that the <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> flux is sinusoidally distributed. The actual conduct of the <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> flux with the length of <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> and its impression on the performance of the generator has not been analyzed so far. In this paper, field analysis of permanent magnet generator using finite element method has been carried out to show the best material properties and <b>air</b> <b>gap</b> for optimum pattern...|$|R
