40|$|A {{high-speed}} {{earthing switch}} (HSES) of a gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) performs a secondary role {{in protecting the}} power system {{in the event of}} an accident. After being interrupted by a circuit breaker (CB), the short-circuit current remaining in the network should be earthed by the HSES. However, as the contacts of the HSES may have been damaged by a <b>pre-arc</b> during the closing operation, the HSES may fail to ground the short-circuit current. To successfully ground the short-circuit current, the contacts of the HSES must be protected from damage by the <b>pre-arc.</b> Thus, minimizing the pre-arcing time is required to step up the making performance. This paper analyzes the making performance of the HSES by predicting the pre-arcing time within the short-circuit current making test. To estimate the pre-arcing time, we compared the results of analytical calculations based on streamer discharge theory and the numerical simulations of the electric field strength. By conducting a short-circuit current making test for a 420 kV 63 kA HSES in a high-power laboratory, the pre-arcing time calculation results were verified. A comparison of the results showed that the proposed prediction method was useful for verifying the performance of the HSES...|$|E
40|$|The <b>pre-arc</b> {{basement}} complex in southwestern Puerto Rico consists of rocks exposed in the Bermeja complex. The oldest rocks are highly serpentinized peridotites {{that occur in}} three belts (Monte del Estado, Río Guanajibo, and Sierra Bermeja). These serpentinites were emplaced into a sequence of Jurassic to mid-Cretaceous pelagic chert (Mariquita chert) that contains abundant rafts and blocks of N-MORB-type amphibolites (Las Palmas amphibolite) and tholeiite and associated trondhjemite fractionates (Lower Cajul MORB) also of N-MORB affinity. The rocks are apparently overlain by a younger sequence of <b>pre-arc</b> plateau basaltic and andesitic lava flows (Upper Cajul Formation) that occur in two distinct geographic sequences, one having E-MORB and the other OIB geochemical characteristics. Overlying these <b>pre-arc</b> rocks in western Puerto Rico are northwest-trending Late Cretaceous to Eocene (85 to 45 Ma) island arc strata that chronologically overlap later volcanic phases in central Puerto Rico. These western Puerto Rico arc rocks have elevated incompatible element concentrations together with conspicuously shallow negative Nb-anomalies, slightly positive Zr-Hf anomalies, and exceedingly high OIB-like Nb/Zr, all indicative of enriched source compositions. Trace element patterns are reproduced by multiple component mixing models involving highly depleted spinel peridotite (RMM 15 to 20) overprinted by small OIB-type (up to ~ 2 %) and pelagic sediment components. Trace element abundances are too high to qualify Atlantic Cretaceous pelagic sediment as a potential contaminant, but mantle-melting models (f= 0. 25) {{are consistent with the}} incorporation of variable proportions of Caribbean Cretaceous pelagic sediment through northdipping subduction of the Caribbean basin. Anomalous two-pyroxene-bearing andesites with extraordinarily high SiO 2 /MgO compared with normal mantle basaltic compositions, also indicate the incorporation of Jurassic to Early Cretaceous pelagic chert from the Caribbean. The high degree of source enrichment in western Puerto Rico is inconsistent with regional within-plate plume tectonics. Instead, it is inferred that the younger north-dipping western Puerto Rico arc (dating from ~ 85 Ma) sampled an upper mantle enrichment zone generated in the backarc region of the older (125 to ~ 85 Ma) south-dipping arc system in central Puerto Ric...|$|E
40|$|Various prototypes {{designs of}} 36 kV vacuum interrupters {{have been tested}} in {{high-power}} test station during capacitive switching operations. Back-to-back tests were performed for inrush current of 20 kA peak level and 4250 Hz frequency. Experiment was performed {{with a number of}} prototype vacuum interrupters of different geometry and contact material. Vacuum gap behavior under pre-arcing and inrush current conditions (<b>pre-arc</b> energy, duration and interruption of inrush current) will be highlighted. Field electron emission measurement has been used to monitor field electron emission current that flows in vacuum gaps after current interruption. Statistics will be presented in relation to the late breakdown events, field electron emission current measurement, vacuum interrupters design and contact material. It was observed that only the mechanism of electron field emission alone could not explain the breakdown in vacuum at the origin of late breakdown phenomena. Contact material, vacuum interrupter design as well as circuit breaker characteristics are determining the dielectric withstand during capacitor bank switching operations...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} question often encountered in experimental physics is, are two observables related or not? Quantile-quantile (q-q) analysis compares the cumulative distributions of two observations (or {{one set of}} observations and a theoretical curve) {{in a way that}} is both visually apparent and statistically quantifiable. If the two observables follow the same distribution, the q-q plot will be linear; if they are identical the plot will have unity slope. Deviations from a linear q-q plot indicate that the two observables do not follow the same distribution. We show that the q-q analysis method is applicable to a wide range of scenarios in experimental physics. As an example, we present a case study of a series of voltage step-up to dielectric breakdown tests with two observables—non-shorting <b>pre-arcs</b> and critical electrostatic discharge (ESD) breakdowns. In each test many <b>pre-arcs</b> are observed, but only one ESD. Initially it was unclear whether or not the field distributions of these two observations were related. Q-q analysis found an extremely significant correlation between <b>pre-arcs</b> and ESD events. Establishing the more copious <b>pre-arcs</b> as an indication of ESD behavior has the potential to greatly accelerate material characterization test times and facilitate selection from numerous candidate materials for applications. This work was supported by a NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship...|$|R
40|$|Highly disordered {{insulating}} materials exposed to high electric fields will, over time, degrade and fail, potentially causing catastrophic damage to devices. Step-up electrostatic discharge (ESD) tests were performed for two common polymer dielectrics, {{low density polyethylene}} and polyimide. Prebreakdown transient current spikes or <b>pre-arcs</b> were observed, using both slow and high speed detection. These pre-ESD discharge phenomena are {{explained in terms of}} breakdown modes and defect generation on a microscopic scale. The field at which pre-breakdown arcing begins was compared to the onset field for electrostatic discharge at which complete breakdown begins to occur for each material. We present evidence that these two threshold fields are closely correlated. Thus, important considerations from applications of fields below the maximum field for breakdown may include the material’s defect structure and the field where pre-breakdown arcing begins in a material...|$|R
40|$|Electrostatic {{discharge}} (ESD) {{can cause}} catastrophic failures in electronic devices. Estimating {{the lifetime of}} dielectrics under prolonged high field exposure is a major design concern for applications including spacecraft, high voltage DC power transmission, and semiconductor electronics. Dielectric strengths listed in engineering handbooks are primarily based on cursory measurements with poor repeatability and tend to overestimate ESD fields in real applications. Standard measurements subject test samples to ~ 500 V/s ramp rates until breakdown. We present the results of ESD studies in two prototypical polymer dielectrics using a ramp rate of ~ 20 V/ 4 s until breakdown together with tests applying a static voltage and directly observing time-to-breakdown. Prior to ESD, transient current spikes, termed <b>pre-arcs,</b> were observed. The results of these tests are {{explained in terms of}} a physics-based model of defect creation within the material from bond stress due to applied electric fields. A first order approximation is presented to develop an extended temperature- and ramp rate-dependent ESD model with both repairable and irreparable defect mechanisms. Repairable defects such as bond bending have energies on the order of thermal energies {{so that they can be}} readily repaired through thermal annealing; irreparable defects such as bond breaking have higher energies. We discuss how defect energies and densities, extracted from the results of accelerated laboratory tests, can be used to estimate fields with a satisfactory probability of material lifetimes of many years...|$|R
40|$|Supra-subduction zone (SSZ) ophiolites {{have the}} geochemical {{characteristics}} of island arcs but {{the structure of}} oceanic crust and {{are thought to have}} formed by sea-floor spreading directly above subducted oceanic lithosphere. They differ from ‘MORB’ ophiolites not only in their geochemistry but also in the more depleted nature of their mantle sequences, the more common presence of podiform chromite deposits, and the crystallization of clinopyroxene before plagioclase which is reflected in the high abundance of wehrlite relative to troctolite in their cumulate sequences. Most of the best-preserved ophiolite complexes in orogenic belts are of this type. Geological reconstructions suggest that most SSZ ophiolites formed during the initial stages of subduction prior to the development of any volcanic arc. Evidence from these ophiolites suggests that the first magma to form in response to intra-oceanic subduction is boninitic in composition, derived by partial melting of hydrated oceanic lithosphere in the ‘mantle wedge’. As subduction proceeds, the magma composition changes to island-arc tholeiite, probably because the hydrated asthenosphere of the ‘mantle wedge’ eventually becomes the dominant mantle source. Other SSZ ophiolites formed {{in the early stages of}} back-arc spreading following splitting of a pre-existing arc. Nonetheless the more common mechanism for formation of SSZ ophiolites appears to have been <b>pre-arc</b> rather than back-arc spreadin...|$|E
40|$|Capacitor {{banks are}} {{installed}} in {{an increasing number}} {{in order to control}} power quality issues in the transmission and distribution networks. Due to load fluctuation, switching of capacitor banks is normally a daily operation. Although the current to be switched (e. g. the normal load current) is far below the maximum capability of circuit breakers, the transient current upon making (the so-called inrush current) {{has proven to be a}} major challenge for circuit breakers. The often very high value of (inrush) current flowing during the closing (pre-) arc between breaker contacts is potentially harmful for the contact system. The IEC circuit breaker 62271 - 100 standard specifies 20 kA peak while energizing (an) additional bank(s) to those already energized, the so-called back-to-back configuration. It will be demonstrated that three-phase energization with full inrush current cannot be reliably performed in test-circuits. Statistics will be presented on the number of (transmission, distribution) circuit breakers that were tested for this duty. The probability of a late breakdown in vacuum, after energization with inrush current, is rising with rated voltage. Absence of late breakdown of vacuum interrupters after capacitive current switching is especially challenging at higher voltage levels, and is a main barrier to develop vacuum interrupters for transmission voltages having very low probability of re-strike. It was observed that in SF 6 circuit breakers, the very intense <b>pre-arc</b> can damage the nozzle, whereas in vacuum circuit breakers, the inrush current arc may deteriorate the dielectric withstand of the switching gap, sometime leading to (late) breakdown after load current interruption. A new measurement method is described to monitor the field electron emission (FEE) current that flows in a pulsating manner in vacuum gaps after current interruption. This measurement system is able to deal (and measure) currents varying as wide as nine decades, from full breakdown currents of several tens of kA to FEE currents of tens of µA). Research tests in full-power test-circuits (following the IEC standard) with a number of prototype vacuum interrupters of different geometry and contact material show a very large range (from micro-amperes to milli-amperes) of current during recovery voltage after load current interruption. It was observed that the load current at longer arcing times reduces the electrical emission activity of the contact surfaces. Large inrush current increases the FEE current. No relationship between steady state FEE current intensity and breakdown probability could be established...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. June 2016. Major: Earth Sciences. Advisors: Donna Whitney, Christian Teyssier. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); v, 168 pages. The Central Anatolian Crystalline Complex (CACC) is a high-grade metamorphic terrain that developed through a protracted history of collision, ophiolite obduction and arc magmatism during {{the closure of}} the Neotethys Ocean. The Central Anatolian Ophiolite (CAO) was emplaced onto the CACC during Cretaceous Neotethyan closure but is now highly dismembered. The Niğde Mafic Complex (NMC) is an association of metamorphosed and variably deformed gabbro, diabase, plagiogranite and ultramafic rocks in the southernmost metasedimentary massif of the CACC - the Niğde Massif. The Niğde Mafic Complex is described in detail for the first time, including its structural, petrologic and geochemical features. Mafic, ultramafic and felsic rocks from two adjacent regions, the Ecemiş Mafic Complex (EMC - east of the Niğde Massif - in the Ecemiş Fault corridor) and the Northern Region (isolated mafic-ultramafic outcrops north of the Niğde Massif) are also examined and compared. In addition, gabbro cobbles from basins adjacent to the Niğde Massif are investigated and their likely provenance is suggested. Whole-rock XRF and ICP-MS data indicate a common, suprasubduction zone, ophiolite origin for rocks of the NMC, EMC and Northern Region, and confirm their correlation to the Central Anatolian Ophiolite. Despite variable mineral assemblages, isotropic gabbro from all three regions has similar geochemical features, including depleted LREE (LaN/YbN= 0. 40 - 0. 89), high Mg numbers (61 - 87) and low TiO 2 (0. 13 - 0. 45 wt. %) that indicate a highly depleted mantle source, consistent with a forearc (or <b>pre-arc)</b> origin. Mineral compositions were determined through microprobe analysis. Gabbro mineral assemblages include magnesian orthopyroxene (En 64 - 79) and calcic plagioclase (An 74 - 95), which are typical of suprasubduction zone, water-saturated conditions for magma genesis. Post-kinematic muscovite, garnet and tourmaline-bearing granitoids intruded the NMC and are likely related to the crustally derived Üçkapılı Granite, limiting the age of ophiolite obduction and deformation to before ~ 85 Ma. Results of hornblende-plagioclase geothermometry for the NMC indicate mid-upper amphibolite facies deformation and metamorphism at temperatures ranging from ~ 560 to 785 °C, similar to conditions reported for the adjacent metasedimentary rocks of the Niğde Massif. Variations in mineral compositions and assemblages among the NMC, EMC and Northern Region reveal a metamorphic gradient whereby the NMC experienced mid-upper amphibolite-facies conditions associated with ductile deformation, and the EMC and Northern Region display evidence for low-grade metamorphism without significant ductile deformation. Overall these findings reveal that the Central Anatolian Ophiolite was locally deformed and metamorphosed in the mid-crust along with tectonically underlying metasedimentary units. 	The Ulukıșla and Ecemiş Basins, bordering the Niğde Massif locally contain abundant gabbro cobbles in Tertiary conglomerates. Gabbro cobbles from the Oligocene Çukurbağ Formation in the Ecemiş Basin have a mixture of island-arc tholeiite and boninitic geochemical affinities, whereas all cobbles from Messinian conglomerates of the m 3 pl unit have boninitic geochemistry, exemplified by Ti/V ratios of less than 10. Based on the presence of metamorphic hornblende and the similarity of geochemical features, gabbro cobbles of the m 3 pl unit may have been sourced in the Niğde Mafic Complex or {{in other parts of the}} CAO. This has implications for our understanding of the landscape evolution of the Niğde Massif region including the former extent of the Niğde Mafic Complex...|$|E
