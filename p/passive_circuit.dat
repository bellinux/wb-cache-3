5|$|The {{resistor}} {{is perhaps}} the simplest of <b>passive</b> <b>circuit</b> elements: as its name suggests, it resists the current through it, dissipating its energy as heat. The resistance {{is a consequence of}} the motion of charge through a conductor: in metals, for example, resistance is primarily due to collisions between electrons and ions. Ohm's law is a basic law of circuit theory, stating that the current passing through a resistance is directly proportional to the potential difference across it. The resistance of most materials is relatively constant over a range of temperatures and currents; materials under these conditions are known as 'ohmic'. The ohm, the unit of resistance, was named in honour of Georg Ohm, and is symbolised by the Greek letter Ω. 1Ω is the resistance that will produce a potential difference of one volt in response to a current of one amp.|$|E

50|$|In {{control systems}} and circuit network theory, a passive {{component}} or circuit {{is one that}} consumes energy, but does not produce energy. Under this methodology, voltage and current sources are considered active, while resistors, capacitors, inductors, transistors, tunnel diodes, metamaterials and other dissipative and energy-neutral components are considered <b>passive.</b> <b>Circuit</b> designers will sometimes refer to this class of components as dissipative, or thermodynamically passive.|$|E
50|$|A {{component}} {{that is not}} passive is called an active component. An electronic circuit consisting entirely of passive components is called a <b>passive</b> <b>circuit</b> (and has the same properties as a passive component).

Typically, analog designers use this term to refer to incrementally passive components and systems, while control systems engineers will use this to refer to thermodynamically passive ones.|$|E

5000|$|In electronics, gain is {{a measure}} of the ability of a two-port circuit (often an amplifier) to {{increase}} the power or amplitude of a signal from the input to the output port by adding energy converted from some power supply to the signal. It is usually defined as the mean ratio of the signal amplitude or power at the output port to the amplitude or power at the input port. It is often expressed using the logarithmic decibel (dB) units ("dB gain"). [...] A gain greater than one (greater than zero dB), that is amplification, is the defining property of an active component or circuit, while a <b>passive</b> <b>circuit</b> will have a gain of less than one.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{proposes a}} method to study the impact of <b>passive</b> <b>circuits</b> such as filters, loads, and board layout on {{conducted}} electromagnetic emissions. The method is dedicated to power converters with N active conductors and a ground conductor, followed by <b>passive</b> <b>circuits.</b> A sophisticated use of impedance matrices allows high frequency current prediction. The power system is divided into functional circuits called blocks. Each passive block is modeled by an impedance matrix. A fast matrix calculation permits association of those matrices to obtain a compact model represented by an impedance matrix. Knowing the converter output voltages and the resulting impedance matrix, currents are calculated to study the influence of each passive block on high frequency current spectrum, and so the EMI (electromagnetic interference). This will help for filter and board layout design for a given load. After presenting the general use of the method, the validation is performed on a differential Class-D audio amplifier used in cell phone applications. The practical application on a two-active conductor system validates the method up to 110 MHz...|$|R
