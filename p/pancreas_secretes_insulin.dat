Via ultrasound guidance we applied steroids directly to ovine fetuses at d 62 and d 82 of gestation, and examined fetal (day 90 gestation) and postnatal (11 months old) pancreatic structure and function. Of three classes of steroid agonists applied (androgen - Testosterone propionate (TP), estrogen - Diethystilbesterol (DES) and glucocorticoid - Dexamethasone (DEX)), only androgens (TP) caused altered pancreatic development. Beta cell numbers were significantly elevated in prenatally androgenised female fetuses (P= 0. 03) (to approximately the higher numbers found in male fetuses), whereas alpha cell counts were unaffected, precipitating decreased alpha:beta cell ratios {{in the developing}} fetal pancreas (P= 0. 001), sustained into adolescence (P= 0. 0004). In adolescence basal insulin secretion was significantly higher in female offspring from androgen-excess pregnancies (P= 0. 045), and an exaggerated, hyperinsulinaemic response to glucose challenge (P= 0. 0007) observed, whereas prenatal DES or DEX treatment had no effects upon insulin secretion. Postnatal insulin secretion correlated with beta cell numbers (P= 0. 03).

40|$|We {{read with}} {{interest}} the paper by Weyman-Daum et al that looked at the glycemic responses ofchildren with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) after high-or low-glycemic-index breakfasts (l). The utility of the glycemic index has been questioned because of the vari-ability of glycemic responses in different individuals (2, 3). It is felt that absolute glycemic responses are affected by factors such as age, sex, body weight, type ofdiabetes, insulin dose, ability of the <b>pancreas</b> to <b>secrete</b> <b>insulin</b> efficiency of the <b>secreted</b> <b>insulin</b> to stimulate glucose up~ take, racial and ethnic differences, and diurnal variation in absorption. There is, however, little data about the effects ofmany ofthese factors. In addition, food factors, such as the type of food, the amount of food, and the amount offat and protein in the meal, affectthe glycemic response. We agree, therefore, {{that it is important}} to eval-uate the effects of various carbohydrate foods given in a mixed meal on the postprandial glycemic response in children with IDDM and to look at the effects ofdifferent insulin doses on the glycemic response. However, the results presented in the paper byWey-man-Daum et al are far from convincing to us because ofserious methodological drawbacks. Glycemic responses ofentirely different groups ofsub-jects were compared. The four comparisons made are meaningless if the glycemic responses of the different groups of subject to a standard test meal are different. There is large heterogeneity of absolute glycemic re-sponses between different subjects taking the same test meal. We do not know what the glycemic responses of the different groups tested here would be if they were given a standard test meal. Given that the glycemic responses were compared in different groups ofsubjects, one would expect the groups to be well matched. However, this was not the case. The subjects studied were extremely heterogeneous. Despite the large degree of variation and the relatively small numbers, there was significant heterogeneity between the gr~ups with respect to height (139 - 170 cm, p < 0. 05), weIght (36 - 63 kg, P < 0. 05) and usual insulin dose, whether expressed as units taken in the morning (5 - 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} the pancreas, from various types of dogs, to correct {{diabetic}} hyperglycemia has been studied (Table XI). The pancreas from one animal was united by a vascular union with the neck blood vessels of another dog which had been pancreatectomized for 20 hours. The time necessary to reduce the blood sugar level to 120 mg. per cent was determined. 1. Pancreas from 6 hypophysectomized dogs produced a normal insulin secretion, showing that an anterior pituitary hormone is not necessary for its production or maintenance. 2. In 14 of 17 normal dogs given anterior pituitary extract for 3 or more consecutive days and presenting diabetes (fasting blood sugar 150 mg. per cent or more) the pancreas showed diminished insulin production. 3. In animals which remained diabetic after discontinuing the injections of hypophyseal extract, the pancreas islands were markedly pathologic and the insulin secretion was practically nil. 4. When hyperglycemia existed on the 2 nd to 5 th day but fell later, the insulin secretion of 5 dogs was normal in 2, supernormal in 1, and less than normal in 2. Histologic examination showed a restoration of beta cells. 5. In 14 dogs resistant to the diabetogenic action of anterior pituitary extract, as shown by little or no change in blood sugar, the pancreatic secretion of insulin was normal in 6 cases, supernormal in 3, and subnormal in 5 cases. Clear signs of hyperfunction of B cells were observed. In 6 resistant animals a high blood sugar (150 mg. per cent) appeared shortly before transplanting, but insulin secretion was normal in 4, supernormal in 1, and subnormal in 1 case. 6. With one injection of extract and 1 day of hyperglycemia {{the capacity of the}} <b>pancreas</b> to <b>secrete</b> <b>insulin</b> was not altered. 7. A high blood sugar level lasting 4 days does not alter the islets. The hypophyseal extract acts, therefore, by some other mechanism. In normal dogs, the continuous intravenous infusion of glucose for 4 days maintained the blood sugar at levels as high as those after pituitary extract. In these animals the B cells were hyperplastic and insulin secretion normal. 8. Anterior hypophyseal hyperglycemia is due at first to extrapancreatic factors which are the most important, and last only during the injections of extracts. Pancreatic factors appear afterwards and are responsible for permanent diabetes. Hypophyseal extract produces histological changes in many tissues and damages the Langerhans islands. The coexistent high blood sugar probably exhausts the B cells and exaggerates their injury. 9. In all cases there is a relation between the cytology of the islet B cells and the <b>insulin</b> <b>secreting</b> capacity...|$|R
40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} (DM) is a chronic, {{metabolic disease}} that {{is associated with}} high levels of blood glucose resulting from defects in insulin production, insulin action, or both. Recent statistics concerning this disease indicate 23. 6 million people in the United States (US) have DM and another 57 million are estimated to have prediabetes. Approx-imately 25 percent of those with DM do not know they have the disease. 1 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, those with DM represent an increase of more than 3 million in almost two years. Almost 8 percent of the US population has dia-betes. The cost of diabetes totals $ 174 billion representing an increase of 32 percent since 2002. 1 Diabetes can contribute to serious health complications and premature death. In 2006, DM was the seventh leading cause of death in the US and is considered to be underreported as a cause of death. 1 Systemic complications associated with DM appear in Table 1. A relative perspective on a daily basis indicates that 4, 100 people are diag-nosed with diabetes, 230 amputations occur in people with diabetes, 120 peo-ple will enter end stage renal disease programs, 55 people will go blind, and 810 will die. 2 There are three main types of DM: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes. Type 1 diabetes accounts for approxi-mately 5 to 10 % of all cases of DM. Although type 1 DM can occur at any age, it typically affects children and young adults. Caucasians tend to have the highest rates of this type of DM. Type 1 diabetes represents an autoim-mune disease characterized by the marked inability of the <b>pancreas</b> to <b>secrete</b> <b>insulin</b> caused by an immuno-logically mediated destruction of β cells.

40|$|Human {{pancreas}} is {{the largest}} digestive gland in the body. It has both endocrine and exocrine functions. <b>Pancreas</b> <b>secretes</b> the hormones <b>insulin</b> and glucagon.

AIM AND OBJECTIVE Keeping the importance of pancreatic hormones in human, {{the present study was}} carried out where we compared the pancreatic morphology of human with that of pig and goat in terms of length, breadth and weight. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study was conducted in the Department of Anatomy, Assam Medical College, Dibrugarh. A total of 90 specimens were included in the study and these were obtained from human, pig and goat. The human specimen (30 in number) were collected from the Forensic Medicine Department of AMCH after fulfilling the official requirements. The specimen of pig and goat (30 each in number) were collected from the local slaughter house after obtaining ethical clearance from the concerned authority. In all specimens, the length, breadth and weight was recorded with the help of measuring tape, vernier callipers and electronic weighing machine. INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA Specimen showing signs of putrefaction, any cut or crush injury and congenital anomalies were excluded from the study. RESULT AND OBSERVATIONS In human, the length of the pancreas ranged from 12. 11 to 15. 09 cm. Maximum breadth of the human pancreas ranged from 4. 03 to 5. 12 cm and the weight ranged from 79. 13 to 102. 22 gram.

40|$|In many countries, first- or second-line {{pharmacological}} treatment {{of patients with}} type 2 diabetes consists of sulfonylureas (such as glibenclamide [known as glyburide in the USA and Canada]), which stimulate the beta cell to <b>secrete</b> <b>insulin.</b> However, emerging evidence suggests that forcing the beta cell to <b>secrete</b> <b>insulin</b> {{at a time when}} it is struggling to cope with the demands of obesity and insulin resistance may accelerate its demise.

In addition, in vitro experiments have suggested that reducing insulin secretion from islets isolated from patients with diabetes can restore insulin pulsatility and improve function. This article will explore the hypothesis that forcing the beta cell to hypersecrete insulin may be counterproductive and lead to dysfunction and death via mechanisms that may involve the endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress.

40|$|BACKGROUND New {{sources of}} insulin-secreting cells are {{strongly}} {{required for the}} cure of diabetes. Recent successes in differentiating embryonic stem cells, {{in combination with the}} discovery {{that it is possible to}} derive human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from somatic cells, have raised the possibility that patient-specific β cells might be derived from patients through cell reprogramming and differentiation. AIMS In this study, we aimed to obtain insulin-producing cells from human iPSC and test their ability to <b>secrete</b> <b>insulin</b> in vivo. METHODS: Human iPSC, derived from both fetal and adult fibroblasts, were differentiated in vitro into pancreas-committed cells and their ability to <b>secrete</b> <b>insulin</b> was measured. iPSCderived cells at two different stages of differentiation (posterior foregut and endocrine cells) were transplanted into immunodeficient mice to test their ability to engraft, differentiate and <b>secrete</b> <b>insulin.</b> RESULTS: IPSC were shown to differentiate into insulin-producing cells in vitro, following the stages of pancreatic organogenesis. At the end of the differentiation, the production of INSULIN mRNA was highly increased and up to 14 % of the cell population became insulin-positive. Terminally differentiated cells also produced C-peptide in vitro in both basal and stimulated conditions. In vivo, mice transplanted with pancreatic cells secreted human C-peptide in response to glucose stimulus, but transplanted cells were observed to lose insulin secretion capacity during the time. At histological evaluation, the grafts were composed of a mixed population of cells containing mature pancreatic cells, but also pluripotent cells and rare neuronal cells. CONCLUSION: These data overall suggest that human iPSC have the potential to generate insulinproducing cells and that these differentiated cells can engraft and <b>secrete</b> <b>insulin</b> in vivo...|$|R

Transplantation of cadaveric pancreatic organs or pancreatic islets can restore normal physiology.

Here, we hypothesized that human iPS cells can be directly differentiated into insulin producing cells (IPCs) capable of <b>secreting</b> <b>insulin.</b> Using a series of pancreatic growth factors, we successfully generated iPS cells derived IPCs.

40|$|The {{gastrointestinal}} tract comprises {{a number of}} digestive organs including the stomach and pancreas. The stomach {{is involved in the}} digestion and short term storage of food while the pancreas is a mixed endocrine and exocrine gland which provides the body with hormones and enzymes essential for nutritional utilisation. The pancreas consists of three different cell lineages, acinar, ductal and endocrine cells. The endocrine cells, organised in the islets of Langerhans, are scattered throughout the exocrine parenchyma and regulate blood glucose levels by production of hormones such as glucagon and insulin. The Nkx family of homeodomain proteins controls numerous processes during development. Previous studies have identified two members belonging to the Nkx 6 subfamily of Nkx proteins, Nkx 6. 1 and Nkx 6. 2. We have described the cloning and embryonic expression pattern of Nkx 6. 3. All three members of the Nkx 6 gene family were shown to be expressed in partially overlapping domains during the development of the {{gastrointestinal tract}} and the central nervous system. Nkx 6. 2 was also identified as a transient marker for pancreatic exocrine cells. Analysing gene expression patterns and morphological features in tissues and organs is often performed by stereologic sampling which is a labour-intensive two dimensional approach that rely on certain assumptions when calculating e. g. β-cell mass and islet number in the pancreas. By combined improvements in immunohistochemical protocols, computational processing and tomographic scanning, we have developed a methodology based on optical projection tomography (OPT) allowing for 3 D visualisation and quantification of specifically labelled objects within intact adult mouse organs. In the pancreas, this technique allows for spatial and quantitative measurements of total islet number and β-cell mass. We have further developed a protocol allowing for high resolution regional analyses based on global OPT assessments of the pancreatic constitution. This methodology is likely to facilitate detailed cellular and molecular analysis of user defined regions of interest in the pancreas, at the same time providing information on the overall disease state of the gland. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T 1 D) can occur at any age and is characterized by the marked inability of the <b>pancreas</b> to <b>secrete</b> <b>insulin</b> due to an autoimmune destruction of the insulin producing β-cells. Information on the key cellular and molecular events underlying the recruitment of lymphocytes, their infiltration of the islets of Langerhans and consequent β-cell destruction is essential for understanding the pathogenesis of T 1 D. Using the developed methodology we have recorded the spatial and quantitative distribution of islet β-cells and infiltrating lymphocytes in the non obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model for T 1 D. This study shows that the smaller islets, which are predominantly organised in the periphery of the organ, are the first to disappear during the progression of T 1 D. The larger islets appear more resistant and our data suggest that a compensatory proliferative process is going on {{side by side with the}} autoimmune-induced β-cell destruction. Further, the formation of structures resembling tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs) in areas apparently unaffected by insulitis suggests that local factors may provide cues for the homing of these lymphocytes back to the pancreas...|$|R
