5000|$|Chanh muối is a salted, pickled lime in Vietnamese cuisine. Its {{name comes}} from the Vietnamese words chanh (meaning [...] "lime") and muối (meaning [...] "salt"). To make the chanh muối, many limes (often key limes) are packed tightly in salt in a glass {{container}} {{and placed in the}} sun until they are pickled. During the process, juices are drawn off the limes, which dissolves the salt and produces a <b>pickling</b> <b>liquid</b> which immerses the finished chanh muối.|$|E

50|$|Main {{ingredients}} {{vary according}} to region and temperature. Some examples are green garlic, garlic scapes, radish, cucumber, chili pepper leaves, chamoe, perilla leaves, and deodeok. Jangajji is usually pickled in soy sauce, soybean paste, or chili paste, but brine and diluted vinegar {{can also be used}} as the <b>pickling</b> <b>liquid.</b> Usually, vegetables are slightly dried or salted to prevent the addition of surplus moisture to the condiment. When served, jangajji is cut, then seasoned with sesame oil, sugar, and toasted sesame seed powder.|$|E
5000|$|When {{water is}} abundant, {{purslane}} performs photosynthesis mostly by C4 carbon fixation, {{which is more}} widespread in nature. When stressed by low availability of water, however, purslane, which has evolved in hot and dry environments, switches to photosynthesis using an alternative pathway, crassulacean acid metabolism (the CAM pathway). At night its leaves trap carbon dioxide, which is converted into malic acid (the souring principle of apples), and, in the day, the malic acid is converted into glucose. When harvested in the early morning, the leaves have ten times the malic acid content as when harvested in the late afternoon, and thus have a significantly more tangy taste. (Opuntia cacti, which are eaten as a vegetable, [...] "nopales", in Mexican cuisine, also employ the CAM pathway and are similarly best harvested in the early morning, though the pickled nopales sold commercially have citric or malic acids added to the <b>pickling</b> <b>liquid.)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{chemical composition}} and antioxidant activities of umezu, <b>pickling</b> <b>liquid</b> of Prunus mume, from different factories in South and East China. The organic acid and phenolic acid profiles were also analyzed. Results showed that umezu was rich in organic acids and extremely sour as P. mume fruit {{in addition to}} its high NaCl level (≥ 20 %). Total acid in umezu was more than 43. 78 [*]g/L in which main organic acids were citric acid and malic acid. Umezu contained more than 250. 54 [*]mg GAE/L total phenolic in which dominant phenolic acids were hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives. Umezu exhibited powerful antioxidant activities in ORAC, ABTS, DPPH, and FRAP assays. Reducing sugar, phenolic compounds, and antioxidant activities of umezu were affected by sample origins and fruit cultivars. Given its rich flavor components and high antioxidant activity, umezu could serve as a new dietary supplement or a natural preservative in food industry...|$|E
5000|$|In {{his book}} Russia at War 1941 to 1945, Alexander Werth {{reported}} that while visiting Gdansk/Danzig in 1945 shortly after its liberation by the Red Army, {{he saw an}} experimental factory outside the city for making soap from human corpses. According to Werth it had been run by [...] "a German professor called Spanner" [...] and [...] "was a nightmarish sight, with its vats full of human heads and torsos <b>pickled</b> in some <b>liquid,</b> and its pails full of a flakey substance—human soap".|$|R

40|$|Potassium ferrate (K 2 FeO 4) is a multi-functional green reagent {{for water}} {{treatment}} with considerable combined effectiveness in oxidization, disinfection, coagulation, sterilization, adsorption, and deodorization, producing environment friendly Fe(III) end-products during the reactions. This study uses a simple method to lower Fe(VI) preparation cost by recycling iron from a spent steel <b>pickling</b> <b>liquid</b> as an iron source for preparing potassium ferrate {{with a wet}} oxidation method. The recycled iron is in powder form of ferrous (93 %) and ferric chlorides (7 %), as determined by X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectrum (XANES) simulation. The synthesis method involves three steps, namely, oxidation of ferrous/ferric ions to form ferrate with NaOCl under alkaline conditions, substitution of sodium with potassium to form potassium ferrate, and continuously washing impurities with various organic solvents off the in-house ferrate. Characterization of the in-house product with various instruments, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), proves that product quality and purity are comparative to a commercialized one. Methylene blue (MB) de-colorization tests with in-house potassium ferrate shows that, within 30 min, almost all MB molecules are de-colorized at a Fe/carbon mole ratio of 2 / 1...|$|E
