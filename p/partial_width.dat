40|$|We {{present an}} {{estimate}} of the <b>partial</b> <b>width</b> of X(3872) into p p-bar under the assumption that it is a weakly-bound hadronic molecule whose constituents are a superposition of the charm mesons D^{* 0 } D-bar^ 0 and D^{ 0 } D-bar^{* 0 }. The p p-bar <b>partial</b> <b>width</b> of X is therefore related to the cross section for p p-bar to D^{* 0 } D-bar^ 0 near the threshold. That cross section at an energy well above the threshold is estimated by scaling the measured cross section for p p-bar to K^{*-} K^+. It is extrapolated to the D^{* 0 } D-bar^ 0 threshold by taking into account the threshold resonance in the 1 ^{++} channel.
