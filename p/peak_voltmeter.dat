40|$|AC Analog {{voltmeters}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} popular electronic measuring instruments in use today. They are used to measure the RMS voltage of the many waveforms commonly found in electronics. This article will provide you with the basics of AC analog voltmeters. It will give you a better understanding of their operation, allowing you to select the right one for your particular measurement. The RMS or root-mean-square voltage is measured because this value gives us the most information about the waveform. The RMS voltage is equivalent to a DC voltage which produces the same heating effect as the AC signal being measured. For example, 1 volt of DC across a 1 ohm resistor will dissipate 1 watt. If we substitute any periodic waveform in place of the DC source and adjust its amplitude so that we again have 1 watt of power dissipated in the load, then our AC signal has an RMS or effective value of 1 volt. In addition to its RMS value, a waveform also has a peak and average voltage value. See Figure 1. ov This sine wave has an RMS value of 1 volt. Its peak value is 1. 4 times its RMS value, or 1. 4 volts. Its rectified average or DC value is. 636 times the peak or. 9 volts in the above example. AC voltmeters are designed to respond to one of these three values. This classifies the meters into true RMS responding, average responding and peak responding. The average and <b>peak</b> responding <b>voltmeters</b> are designed to measure only sine waves. Average Responding With an average responding voltmeter, a sine wave being measured is fed through a DC blocking capacitor, amplified or attenuated, rectified by the diode bridge and fed to the meter. The meter then responds to this rectified average or DC value. The average value of a sine wave is zero, so when we say average responding we mean the rectified average or DC component after rectification. This DC component deflects a dâ€™Arsonval (moving coil) meter to indicate the RMS value of a sine wave...|$|R
