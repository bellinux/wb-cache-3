The angered Mireuk cursed the earth, creating prostitution, betrayal, mental disorders, bragging, and other imperfections of the world. Seokga, the undeserving victor, then imprisoned Mireuk.|$|E
25|$|One {{summer night}} in 1916, near Ploegsteert, Eden had {{to lead a}} small raid into an enemy trench to kill or capture enemy soldiers, so as to {{identify}} the enemy units opposite. He and his men were pinned down in No Man’s Land under enemy fire, his sergeant seriously wounded in the leg. Eden sent one man back to British lines to fetch another man and a stretcher, then he and three others carried the wounded sergeant back with, as he later <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> memoirs, a “chilly feeling down our spines”, unsure whether the Germans had not seen them in the dark or were chivalrously declining to fire. He omitted to mention {{that he had been}} awarded the Military Cross for the incident, something of which he had made little mention in his political career. On 18 September 1916, after the Battle of Flers-Courcelette (part of the Battle of the Somme), he wrote to his mother “I have seen things lately that I am not likely to forget”. On 3 October, he was appointed an adjutant, with the rank of temporary lieutenant for the duration of that appointment. At the age of 19, he was the youngest adjutant on the Western Front.|$|E

He found Ali's refusal to serve in the U.S. Army in the Vietnam War to be offensive, because, as he <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> autobiography [...] "The Gardens was founded by men – sportsmen – who fought for their country. It is no place for those want to evade conscription in their own country. The Gardens was built for many things, but not for picking up things that no one else wants."

500|$|Recovering in {{time for}} the start of the 2011–12 season, Samuelsson played six games for Vancouver before being traded away on October 22, 2011. He was sent back to Florida for his second stint with the Panthers, along with fellow veteran forward Marco Sturm, in {{exchange}} for forwards David Booth and Steven Reinprecht, as well as a third-round draft pick in 2013. In an interview with HockeySverige.se at the end of the season, he told Swedish reporters that while he enjoyed playing in Vancouver, competing alongside countrymen Alexander Edler and the Sedins in particular, he [...] "didn't think very highly of management." [...] He also criticized Alexandre Burrows for his actions during the Finals, when he bit Patrice Bergeron's finger after the Bruins forward had <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> mouth, citing it a rallying point for the Bruins in their defeat of the Canucks.|$|E
500|$|Allen {{was the son}} of John and Sarah Allen. His {{father was}} a native of Connecticut and of English origin, and his mother was {{originally}} from Vermont and of Scottish descent. He left home when he was eight years old [...] "to carve out a fortune for himself", as Sylvester <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> History of Rensselaer County, New York. He began work in an auger factory in Hamden, Connecticut, at an early age and continued until he was seventeen years old. At that time, he purchased a clock store, which he traded for horses in Vermont and Canada. He shipped his horses to the West Indies, but the ship was wrecked and his horses were lost, thus placing him badly in debt. However, he soon obtained credit, and again shipped a number of horses to the West Indies, this time successfully, enabling him to pay all his debts and even earning him a profit.|$|E
500|$|At least 85 {{people died}} during the purge, {{although}} the final death toll {{may have been in}} the hundreds, and some estimates run as high as 700 to 1,000. More than a thousand perceived opponents were arrested. Most of the killings were carried out by the [...] (SS) and the Gestapo (Geheime Staatspolizei), the regime's secret police. The purge strengthened and consolidated the support of the Reichswehr for Hitler. It also provided a legal grounding for the Nazi regime, as the German courts and cabinet quickly swept aside centuries of legal prohibition against extrajudicial killings to demonstrate their loyalty to the regime. The Night of the Long Knives was a turning point for the German government. It established Hitler as [...] "the supreme justiciar of the German people", as he <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> July 13, 1934 speech to the Reichstag, the rubber-stamp ceremonial Parliament of the Third Reich from 1933 to 1945.|$|E

500|$|Until 1923, the Yankees {{had been}} tenants of the Giants at the Polo Grounds, but had opened Yankee Stadium that year, {{and this was}} the site for Game 1 of the 1923 World Series on October 10. Casey Stengel's at bat in the ninth inning with the score tied 4–4 was [...] "the stuff of legend", as Appel <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> history of the Yankees. Before the largest crowd he had ever played before, Stengel lined a changeup from Joe Bush for a hit that went between the outfielders deep to left center. Hobbled by his injury and even more as a sponge inside his shoe flew out as he rounded second base, [...] Stengel slowly circled the bases, and evaded the tag from catcher Wally Schang for an inside-the-park home run, {{providing}} the winning margin. Thus, the first World Series home run in old Yankee Stadium's history did not go to Babe Ruth, [...] "that honor, with great irony, would fall to the aging reserve outfielder Casey Stengel".|$|E
500|$|The Night of the Long Knives {{represented}} a triumph for Hitler, and {{a turning point}} for the German government. It established Hitler as [...] "the supreme leader of the German people", as he <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> July 13 speech to the Reichstag. Later, in April 1942, Hitler would formally adopt this title, thus placing himself de jure as well as de facto above the reach of the law. Centuries of jurisprudence proscribing extrajudicial killings were swept aside. Despite some initial efforts by local prosecutors to take legal action against those who carried out the murders, which the regime rapidly quashed, it appeared that no law would constrain Hitler in his use of power. The Night of the Long Knives also sent a clear message to the public that even the most prominent Germans were not immune from arrest or even summary execution should the Nazi regime perceive them as a threat. In this manner, the purge established a pattern of violence that would characterise the Nazi regime.|$|E

500|$|Within the military, {{particularly}} its senior echelons, Bennett was criticised {{for leaving}} his troops. In April 1942, {{he was promoted}} to lieutenant general and given command of III Corps in Perth. At the time, this was an important post, but by 1943, as the possibility of a Japanese invasion of Australia faded, it became a backwater. Bennett was told by Blamey {{that he would not be}} given another active command, and he transferred to the Reserve of Officers in May 1944. He soon published his account of the Malayan campaign, Why Singapore Fell, which was critical of Percival and other British officers, although his opinions were later challenged by several Australian officers, including Callaghan. Blamey unsuccessfully tried to prevent the book's publication. Upon retirement from active service, Bennett began writing for a Sydney newspaper and as a correspondent for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. He remained concerned about his soldiers, though, and met the first group of recently freed 8th Division prisoners of war when they arrived in Sydney on the transport Manunda. For their part, the majority of his former soldiers welcomed him, some even hung a sign over the side of the ship, which read: [...] "We want Bennett". They later <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> car as a gesture of their support.|$|E
500|$|In Takumi's {{initial draft}} of the story, the second episode, [...] "Turnabout Sisters", was the first episode of the game. The {{development}} team decided {{that it did not}} work well as something that would ease players into the game, because of its length among other factors. Because of this, Takumi wrote a shorter episode, [...] "The First Turnabout", which was used as the game's first episode. Takumi wanted players to focus on the thrill of [...] "nailing the culprit", especially for the first episode; because of this, the culprit of the first episode is shown in that episode's opening, as this was the most direct way Takumi could think of doing it. According to Takumi, it was a challenge to write the episode, as, in addition to keeping it short, he had to set up the world of Ace Attorney and the types of characters that players would meet. The third episode was written {{for the sake of the}} character Miles Edgeworth, and the theme of the fourth episode was [...] "rekindling the relationship". In it, Takumi tried to portray an intensively strong friendship between Phoenix and Edgeworth; he did wonder if that was what people got from it, saying that some people interpreted the bond between Phoenix and Edgeworth as [...] an [...] "intensively passionate bond". Because of these two episodes, Takumi considered Edgeworth to in a way be the game's protagonist. The classroom trial in the game's fourth episode was based on real events: when Takumi was in second grade, he had found a 5 yen coin and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> pocket; his teacher accused him of stealing it from another student, and made him apologize to her.|$|E
500|$|Michael {{blockaded}} Thomas's {{cities of}} refuge but organized no assaults, instead aiming to capture them peacefully by wearing out their defenders. His strategy {{was motivated by}} the political and propaganda expedient of appearing merciful—"in order to spare Christian blood", as Michael himself <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> letter to Louis the Pious—but also, according to the chroniclers, by fear of demonstrating to the Bulgarians that the Byzantine cities' fortifications could fall to attack. In Asia Minor, Thomas's partisans hoped to lure Michael away by allowing the Arabs free passage to raid the provinces of Opsikion and Optimaton, which were loyal to the emperor. Michael was unmoved and continued the blockade. His troops barred access to Arcadiopolis [...] with a ditch. To conserve supplies, the blockaded troops sent away women and children, followed by those too old, wounded, or otherwise incapable of bearing arms. After five months of blockade, Thomas's loyalists were eventually forced to eat starved horses and their hides. Some began deserting by lowering themselves with ropes over the city walls or jumping from them. Thomas sent messengers to Bizye, where the blockade was less close, to arrange a relief attempt by Anastasius. Before anything could be done, however, the exhausted troops at Arcadiopolis surrendered their leader in exchange for an imperial pardon. Thomas was delivered to Michael seated on a donkey and bound in chains. He was prostrated before the emperor, who placed his foot on his defeated rival's neck and ordered {{his hands and feet}} cut off and his corpse impaled. Thomas pleaded for clemency with the words [...] "Have mercy on me, oh True Emperor!" [...] Michael only asked his captive to reveal whether any of his own senior officials had had dealings with Thomas. Before Thomas could respond, the Logothete of the Course, John Hexaboulios, advised against hearing whatever claims a defeated rebel might make. Michael agreed, and Thomas's sentence was carried out immediately.|$|E
