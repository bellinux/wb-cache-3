5|$|A major turning <b>point</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{movement}} {{came during}} World War I, when many U.S. servicemen {{were diagnosed with}} venereal diseases. The government's response included an anti-venereal disease campaign that framed sexual intercourse and contraception as issues {{of public health and}} legitimate topics of scientific research. This was the first time a U.S. government institution had engaged in a sustained, public discussion of sexual matters; as a consequence, contraception transformed from an issue of morals to an issue of public health.|$|E
