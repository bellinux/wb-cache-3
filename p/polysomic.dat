40|$|We modeled the {{behavior}} of recessive mutations with deleterious effects to either the sporophyte or the gametophyte, or both, in <b>polysomic</b> tetraploid populations by allowing for varying levels of double reduction, mutation, and self-fertilization. Double reduction causes a decrease of the equilibrium frequencies of deleterious alleles, and it has much more influence on genes subjected to gametophytic selection than on genes solely under sporophytic selection. With gametophytic selection, low frequencies of double reduction are enough to reduce equilibrium frequencies severalfold. Double reduction occurs when sister alleles migrate to the same gamete during meiosis. It depends on the frequency at which a locus recombines with its centromere, and on the frequency of multivalent formation. Therefore, a greater accumulation of deleterious mutations should occur on <b>polysomic</b> chromosomes with a prevalence of bivalent pairing and in chromosomal regions between centromeres and proximal chiasmata. Proximal loci should have a greater impact in reducing the fitness of a polyploid population being inbred. This prediction can explain observations that homozygosities at different subchromosomal regions have distinct effects on inbreeding depression in polyploids. Furthermore, even mildly deleterious alleles can lead to large amounts of inbreeding depression because of their high equilibrium frequencies. Molecular studies correlating level of heterozygosity and degree of heterosis should take into account this nonuniform distribution of deleterious alleles in polyploid genomes. Preservation or enhancement of heterozygosity would be more critical at proximal regions than at other chromosome regions in <b>polysomic</b> polyploid species...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} effect of {{chromosome}} 17 copy number on HER- 2 /neu status determination in breast cancers. Experimental Design: HER- 2 /neu gene copy and chromosome 17 centromere numbers were evaluated on 893 breast carcinomas using double color {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH). The net and chromosome 17 corrected (ratio) HER- 2 /neu copy numbers were compared and related to immunohistochemistry done according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved scoring system (0, 1 +, 2 +, and 3 +) as a first screening step in 584 cases. Results: When a ratio ≥ 2 was considered as criterion for FISH positivity, 49. 3 % (440 of 893) of cases showed amplification versus 56. 2 % (502 -of 893) by using a net HER- 2 /neu gene copy number > 4 as a alternative criterion; 14. 8 % (67 of 453) of cases having a ratio 4 and 1. 1 % (5 of 440) with a ratio > 2 had a net HER- 2 /neu gene copy number 2 : 25 chromosomes 17 /cell) and among <b>polysomic</b> cases, 12. 8 % (40 of 312) of the low <b>polysomic</b> (2. 26 - 3. 75 chromosomes 17 /cell) and 36. 9 % (24 of 65) of the highly <b>polysomic</b> (> 3. 75 chromosomes 17 /cell) cases showed discordance. In cases with a ratio < 2, polysomy 17 incidences were 85. 7 % (6 of 7) in IHC 3 +, 42. 4 % (79 of 186) in IHC 2 +, 33. 3 % (15 of 45) in IHG 1 +, and 29. 1 % (16 of 55) in IHC 0. Conclusion: A net increase in HER- 2 /neu gene copy number consecutive to polysomy 17 in the absence of specific gene amplification might lead to a strong protein over-expression in a small subset of breast carcinomas.

Based on 472 individuals sampled over four tetraploid and eight octoploid cultivars, six to 55 alleles were detected per locus {{with an average}} of 24. 1.

40|$|Nowadays, the {{population}} genetics analysis of autopolyploid species faces many difficulties due to (i) limited development of population genetics tools under <b>polysomic</b> inheritance, (ii) difficulties to assess allelic dosage when genotyping individuals and (iii) {{a form of}} inbreeding resulting from the mechanism of 'double reduction'. Consequently, few data analysis computer programs are applicable to autopolyploids. To contribute bridging this gap, this article first derives theoretical expectations for the inbreeding and identity disequilibrium coefficients under <b>polysomic</b> inheritance in a mixed mating model. Moment estimators of these coefficients are proposed when exact genotypes or just markers phenotypes (i. e. allelic dosage unknown) are available. This {{led to the development}} of estimators of the selfing rate based on adult genotypes or phenotypes and applicable to any even-ploidy level. Their statistical performances and robustness were assessed by numerical simulations. Contrary to inbreeding-based estimators, the identity disequilibrium-based estimator using phenotypes is robust (absolute bias generally < 0. 05), even in the presence of double reduction, null alleles or biparental inbreeding due to isolation by distance. A fairly good precision of the selfing rate estimates (root mean squared error < 0. 1) is already achievable using a sample of 30 - 50 individuals phenotyped at 10 loci bearing 5 - 10 alleles each, conditions reachable using microsatellite markers. Diallelic markers (e. g. SNP) can also perform satisfactorily in diploids and tetraploids but more polymorphic markers are necessary for higher ploidy levels. The method is implemented in the software SPAGeDi and should contribute to reduce the lack of population genetics tools applicable to autopolyploids. Â© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Abstract: Construction and use of linkage maps are challenging in hexaploids with <b>polysomic</b> inheritance. Full map integration requires calculations of recombination frequency between markers with complex segregation types. In addition, detection of QTL in hexaploids requires information on all six alleles at one locus for each individual. We describe a method {{that we used to}} construct a fully integrated linkage map for chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum × morifolium, 2 n = 6 x = 54). A bi-parental F 1 population of 406 individuals was genotyped with an 183, 000 SNP genotyping array. The resulting linkage map consisted of 30, 312 segregating SNP markers of all possible marker dosage types, representing nine chromosomal linkage groups and 107 out of 108 expected homologues. Synteny with lettuce (Lactuca sativa) showed local colinearity. Overall, it was high enough to number the chrysanthemum chromosomal linkage groups according to those in lettuce. We used the integrated and phased linkage map to reconstruct inheritance of parental haplotypes in the F 1 population. Estimated probabilities for the parental haplotypes were used for multi-allelic QTL analyses on four traits with different underlying genetic architectures. This resulted in the identification of major QTL that were affected by multiple alleles having a differential effect on the phenotype. The presented linkage map sets a standard for future genetic mapping analyses in chrysanthemum and closely related species. Moreover, the described methods are a major step forward for linkage mapping and QTL analysis in hexaploids...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: One of {{the most}} common genetic aberrations {{associated}} with breast cancer is the amplification and overexpression of the ERBB 2 proto-oncogene located at chromosome 17, bands q 12 - 21. The amplification/overexpression occurs in 25 to 30 % of all breast cancers. In breast cancer, aneusomy of chromosome 17, either monosomy or polysomy, is frequently observed by conventional cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The aim {{of this study was to}} discover whether or not numerical aberrations on chromosome 17 have a correlation to the amplification or overexpression of the ERBB 2 gene and to analyze their clinical implications in subgroups showing 2 + or 3 + positive scores by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Methods: We used FISH on a series of 175 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast carcinomas to detect ERBB 2 amplification, using a dual-probe system for the simultaneous enumeration of the ERBB 2 gene and the centromeric region of chromosome 17, as well as using IHC to detect overexpression. We analyzed clinical and pathological variables in a subgroup of patients with 2 + and 3 + IHC scores (147 patients), to describe any differences in clinicopathological characteristics between <b>polysomic</b> and non-polysomic cases with the use of the χ 2 test. Results: We found 13 % of cases presenting polysomy, and three cases presented monosomy 17 (2 %). According to the status of the ERBB 2 gene, instances of polysomy 17 were more frequently observed in non-amplified cases than in FISH-amplified cases, suggesting that the mechanism for ERBB 2 amplification is independent of polysomy 17. Polysomy 17 was detected in patients with 2 + and 3 + IHC scores. We found that nodal involvement was more frequent in <b>polysomic</b> than in non-polysomic cases (P = 0. 046). Conclusions: The determination of the copy number of chromosome 17 should be incorporated into the assesment of ERBB 2 status. It might also be helpful to differentiate a subgroup of breast cancer patients with polysomy of chromosome 17 and overexpression of ERBB 2 protein that probably have genetic and clinical differences...|$|E

40|$|Macrosynteny and {{colinearity}} between Fragaria (strawberry) species showing extreme {{levels of}} ploidy {{have been studied}} through comparative genetic mapping between the octoploid cultivated strawberry (F. ×ananassa) and its diploid relatives. A comprehensive map of the octoploid strawberry, in which almost all linkage groups are ranged into the seven expected homoeologous groups was obtained, thus providing the first reference map for the octoploid Fragaria. High levels of conserved macrosynteny and colinearity were observed between homo(eo) logous linkage groups and between the octoploid homoeologous groups and their corresponding diploid linkage groups. These results reveal that the polyploidization events that took place along {{the evolution of the}} Fragaria genus and the more recent juxtaposition of two octoploid strawberry genomes in the cultivated strawberry did not trigger any major chromosomal rearrangements in genomes involved in F. ×ananassa. They further suggest the existence of a close relationship between the diploid Fragaria genomes. In addition, despite the possible existence of residual levels of <b>polysomic</b> segregation suggested by the observation of large linkage groups in coupling phase only, the prevalence of linkage groups in coupling/repulsion phase clearly demonstrates that the meiotic behavior is mainly disomic in the cultivated strawberry...|$|E
40|$|Asexual seed {{production}} (agamospermy) via gametophytic apomixis in flowering plants typically involves {{the formation of}} an unreduced megagametophyte (via apospory or diplospory) and the parthenogenetic development of the unreduced egg cell into an embryo. Agamospermy is almost exclusively restricted to polyploids. In this study, the genetic basis of agamospermy was investigated in a segregating population of 130 F(1) 's from a cross between triploid (2 n = 27) agamospermous Erigeron annuus and sexual diploid (2 n = 18) E. strigosus. Correlations between markers and phenotypes and linkage analysis were performed on 387 segregating amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). Results show that four closely linked markers with <b>polysomic</b> inheritance are significantly associated with parthenogenesis and that 11 cosegregating markers with univalent inheritance are completely associated with diplospory. This indicates that diplospory and parthenogenesis are unlinked and inherited independently. Further, the absence of agamospermy in diploid F(1) 's appears to be best explained by a combination of recessive-lethal gametophytic selection against the parthenogenetic locus and univalent inheritance of the region bearing diplospory. These results may have major implications for attempts to manipulate agamospermy for agricultural purposes and for interpreting the evolution of the trait...|$|E
40|$|Autopolyploidy, genome {{duplication}} per se, is {{a severe}} mutation which presents both great challenge and {{great opportunity for}} the species which has undergone it. First, {{a whole series of}} initial challenges has to be overcome, e. g., establishment within diploid parental population, proper functioning of the cell with doubled genetic information and restoration of proper mitosis and meiosis. The population genetic changes can become beneficial afterwards as the two times higher effective population size and <b>polysomic</b> inheritance increase heterozygosity and genetic variability within the new polyploid lineage. It also reduces negative impacts of genetic drift and inbreeding depression. In evolutionary context, having two genomes allows selection to be more relaxed, thus genes can quickly diversify into alleles with new function or sub-function. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of selection on a population level, I choose example of meiosis genes evolution in a polyploid Arabidopsis arenosa (Brassicaceae) species complex. This only diploid-autotetraploid member of the plant leading model genus Arabidopsis provides an ideal system for addressing general questions on the triggers and consequences of genome duplication in plants. In contrast to other members of the genus, A. arenosa remained [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the northeastern}} part of Belgium, the Centaurea jacea complex shows {{extensive}} morphological variation and {{is represented by}} a diploid (2 n = 22) and a tetraploid (2 n = 44) cytotype. <b>Polysomic</b> inheritance of allozyme markers in the tetraploids, suggesting autopolyploidy, is here demonstrated for the first time. In order to test whether the tno cytotypes occupy distinct habitats and possess different gene pools, patterns of allozymic and morphological variation were investigated in relation to ploidy level and site characteristics in 26 populations from the Belgian Ardennes. The two cytotypes showed a parapatric distribution, the diploids occurring at higher elevations (mostly above 500 m) than the tetraploids (mostly below 500 m). Three mixed populations were found near the contact zone of the two cytotypes. Within the mixed populations no triploid plant and no evidence for gene flow between cytotypes were found, despite widely overlapping flowering periods. The two cytotypes can be distinguished {{on the basis of}} morphological traits and enzymatic gene pools. The congruence of morphological and allozymic variation with chromosome numbers suggests a secondary contact between the two cytotypes with limited gene flow between them. The origin and persistence of the parapatric distribution are discussed. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|IMPF: 01. 73 The plant nucleus is {{a highly}} ordered and dynamic structure, with a {{considerable}} level of variation between species in terms of genome size, genome organisation, chromosome territories and patterns associated with developmental changes. Diploids naturally represent the simplest state of affairs, but in the plant world more than 70 % of species {{may have been involved}} in polyploidisation events at some stage during their evolution. Autopolyploids have multiple sets of chromosomes from a single species, and aside from the complexities of meiosis we may expect them to accommodate their <b>polysomic</b> state as well as their disomic relatives. Allopolyploids are at the other extreme, with multiple sets of chromosomes from 2 or more species, embedded in the cytoplasm of the maternal parent following hybridisation, and this presents the nucleus of nascent allopolyploids with certain zones of conflict. Nature has found ways to make the accommodation, and recent developments in molecular analysis have now opened a window for the experimenter to view the process of this adjustment, and to see how rapidly it takes place and what processes are involved. The nature of the resolution of nuclear conflicts in diploid hybrids and in allopolyploids is discussed. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{availability}} of reliable genetic linkage maps {{is crucial for}} functional and evolutionary genomic analyses. Established theory and methods of genetic linkage analysis have made map construction a routine exercise in diploids. However, many evolutionarily, ecologically, and/or agronomically important species are autopolyploids, with autotetraploidy being a typical example. These species undergo much more complicated chromosomal segregation and recombination at meiosis than diploids. In addition, {{there is evidence of}} polyploidy-induced and highly dynamic changes {{in the structure of the}} genome. These <b>polysomic</b> characteristics indicate the inappropriateness of the theory and methods of linkage analysis in diploids for use in these species and a gap in the theory and methodology of tetraploid map construction. This paper presents a theoretical model and statistical framework for multilocus linkage analysis in autotetraploids for use with dominant and/or codominant DNA molecular markers. The theory and methods incorporate the essential features of allele segregation and recombination under tetrasomic inheritance and the major challenges in statistical modeling and marker data analysis. We validated the method and explored its statistical properties by intensive simulation study and demonstrated its utility by analysis of AFLP and SSR marker data from an outbred autotetraploid potato population...|$|E
40|$|The {{cultivated}} potato, Solanum tuberosum L. (2 n= 4 x= 48), has a {{very large}} number of related wild and cultivated tuber-bearing species, widely distributed in the Americas. These species, grouped in 16 taxonomic series, range from the diploid to the hexaploid level. Polyploid species are either disomic or <b>polysomic.</b> Sexual polyploidization via genetically controlled 2 n gametes has played a major role in their evolution. Species are separated in nature by geographical and ecological barriers. However, there are several examples of sympatric species that share the same niches but do not readily cross (i. e. the diploids S. commersonii and S. chacoense, in certain areas of Argentina). External barriers are, therefore, not sufficient to explain species integrity. In addition, there are no strong evidences indicating that genome differentiation is important in the group. Thus, evidences are presented in this review to support the assertion that interspecific pollen-pistil incompatibiliy, nuclear-cytoplasmic male sterility and endosperm are major forces that strengthen the external hybridization barriers allowing, at the same time and under specific circumstances, a certain amount of gene exchange without jeopardizing the integrity of the species...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} analyses, {{including}} fluorescence {{in situ hybridization}} (FISH), quantitative PCR (qPCR) and array CGH (aCGH), have been performed on a series of chordomas from 181 patients. Twelve of 181 (7 %) tumours displayed amplification of the T locus and an additional two cases showed focal amplification; 70 / 181 (39 %) tumours were <b>polysomic</b> for chromosome 6, and 8 / 181 (4. 5 %) primary tumours showed a minor allelic gain of T as assessed by FISH. No germline alteration of the T locus was identified in non-neoplastic tissue from 40 patients. Copy number gain of T was seen in a similar percentage of sacrococcygeal, mobile spine and base of skull tumours. Knockdown of T in the cell line, U-CH 1, which showed polysomy of chromosome 6 involving 6 q 27, resulted in a marked decrease in cell proliferation and morphological features consistent with a senescence-like phenotype. The U-CH 1 cell line was validated as representing chordoma by the generation of xenografts, which showed typical chordoma morphology and immunohistochemistry in the NOD/SCID/interleukin 2 receptor [IL 2 r]gammanull mouse model. In conclusion, chromosomal aberrations resulting in gain of the T locus are common in sporadic chordomas and expression of this gene is critical for proliferation of chordoma cells in vitro...|$|E
