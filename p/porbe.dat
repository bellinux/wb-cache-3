50|$|C-Pop was {{originally}} opened in March 1996 by Rick Manore with partners Michael Lask and Marty Geramita {{in the basement}} of a former church at 515 S. Lafayette in Royal Oak with a significant initial emphasis on rock posters, but was also associated with and moved towards a focus on less mass-produced art, including the Lowbrow art movement. The first exhibit in the space was for Robert Williams in May 1996. The gallery later moved to the David Whitney Building (Suite 313) in Detroit before finally opening in its final location at 4160 Woodward (the former Detroit Bowling & Trophy, in the same block as the Majestic Theater) in September 1999, with a notable sign created by Alex <b>Porbe</b> and significant renovations to the space funded by artist and eventual gallery owner Tom Thewes (son of Compuware co-founder Thomas Thewes). The physical gallery closed in the summer of 2009.|$|E

He released his two records nameed ’Phire Dekho Na’ and ‘Janina Tumi Kothay’ in association with HMV. The lyrics were written by Sidheswar Mukhopadhay. It was based on keertan andaz, and Manabendra was trained towards Keertans, Bhajans and Bhaktigeeti from the very early childhood. His uncles were trained classical experts and mainly due to their influence {{he came into the}} world of music. A number of his songs began to hit the airwaves including the romantic [...] "Emni Kore <b>Porbe</b> Mone" [...] (Lyrics -Shyamal Gupta), and semi classically bent [...] "Ghumayona Saheli Go". Within a short span, Manabendra drew the attention of the erstwhile leading music composers of Bengal, namely Salil Chowdhury, Sudhin Dasgupta, Robin Chatterji, Anol Chatterji, Nochiketa Ghosh, Probir Mojumdar, Gyan Prakash Ghosh, Abhijeet Banerjee, and others. His successful songs include [...] "Ami Parini bujhite parini",and 'Jodi Jante' composed by Salil Chowdhury, [...] "Mayur Konthi Ratero nile" [...] and [...] "Tari Churite Je Rekhechhi Mon Shona Kore by Sudhin Dasgupta", 'Jodi Amake Dekho Tumi Udashi' and 'Sei Chokh Kothai Tomar' by Abhijit Banerjee, [...] "Ei neel nirjan sagore" [...] by Probir Majumdar, [...] "Birohini Chiro Birohini" [...] by Himangshu Dutta, [...] "Bone Noy Mone Mor", 'Aha Na roy Na' by Dr. Nachiketa Ghosh, [...] "Tomar Pother Prante Moner monideep jele rekhechi" [...] and 'Tumi Phiraye Diyechho Bole' by Satinath Mukherjee.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, the {{security}} {{has become a}} critical part of any organization or industry information systems. The Intrusion Detection System is an effective method to deal with the new kind of threats such as DoS, <b>Porbe,</b> R 2 L and U 2 R. In this paper, we analyze the various approaches such as Hidden Semi Markov Model, Conditional Random Fields and Layered Approach, Bayesian classification, Data Mining techniques, Clustering Algorithms such as K-Means and Fuzzy c-Means, Back Propagation Neural Network, SOM Neural Network, Rough Set Neural Network Algorithm, Genetic Algorithm, Pattern Matching, Principle Component Analysis, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Independent Component Analysis, Multivariate Statistical Analysis, SOM/PSO algorithm etc. The performance is measured for two different datasets using various approaches. The datasets are trained and tested for identifying the new attacks that will affect the hosts or networks. The well known KDD Cup 1999 or DARPA 1999 dataset has been used to improve the accuracy and performance. The four groups of attacks are identified as Probe, DoS, U 2 R and R 2 L. The dataset used for training set is 494, 021 and testing set is 311, 028. The aim is to improve the detection rate and performance of the proposed system...|$|E
