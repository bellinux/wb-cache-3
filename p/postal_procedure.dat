40|$|Abstract: The use of e-voting for the {{elections}} to the Austrian Federation of students (Hochschülerinnen und Hochschülerschaftswahlen) {{was one of}} the most sophisticated Austrian e-government projects in 2009. The task was to complement the paper based voting with an electronic voting channel in order to create new opportunities to vote. Together with the implementation of e-voting the legal basis of the federation of students was adapted to include an electronic election administration. The discussion around e-voting was rather controversial with clear pro and contra positions. This first of a kind implementation of e-voting in Austria was technically successful. Almost 1 % (2. 161) of the eligible students cast their votes electronically between 18 th and 22 nd of May 2009. For identification and authentication, they used the citizen card (the Austrian model of a smart card with digital signature) and a suitable smartcard-reader device, which was handed out for free. The anonymity was performed by using a cryptographic protocol in the post-voting phase, similar to a paper based <b>postal</b> voting <b>procedure.</b> The e-votin...|$|R
40|$|Background There is a {{gap between}} {{increasing}} demands from pharmacy journals, publishers, and reviewers for high survey response rates and the actual responses often obtained in the field by survey researchers. Presumably demands have been set high because response rates, times, and costs affect the validity and reliability of survey results. Objective Explore {{the extent to which}} survey response rates, average response times, and economic costs are affected by conditions under which pharmacist workforce surveys are administered. Methods A random sample of 7200 U. S. practicing pharmacists was selected. The sample was stratified by delivery method, questionnaire length, item placement, and gender of respondent for a total of 300 observations within each subgroup. A job satisfaction survey was administered during March–April 2012. Results Delivery method was the only classification showing significant differences in response rates and average response times. The <b>postal</b> mail <b>procedure</b> accounted for the highest response rates of completed surveys, but the email method exhibited the quickest turnaround. A hybrid approach, consisting of a combination of postal and electronic means, showed the least favorable results. Postal mail was 2. 9 times more cost effective than the email approach and 4. 6 times more cost effective than the hybrid approach. Conclusion Researchers seeking to increase practicing pharmacists 2 ̆ 7 survey participation and reduce response time and related costs can benefit from the analytical procedures tested here...|$|R
50|$|The Postal Service Act of 1792 legally allowed Congressional {{newspapers}} {{into the}} mail system postage free: Despite this, postal officers often {{still did not}} allow newspapers to be carried in the official portmanteau with the regular mail. Where the mail was carried by post riders at the time, then the newspapers had to be light and able to fit in the saddlebag or else they {{were likely to be}} left behind because they would be too much of a load for the rider. Post riders carried official portmanteau horse leather saddlebags that carried the mail, that contained Congressional newspapers, on their horse's backside, which were locked and could only be opened by an authorized <b>postal</b> person. This <b>procedure</b> came about because of constant complaints of personal mail being previously opened before arrival. The letters and newspapers were divided into two separate canvas or linen bags and placed inside portmanteaux for distribution.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Frailty {{among older}} people {{is related to}} an {{increased}} risk of adverse health outcomes such as acute and chronic diseases, disability and mortality. Although many intervention studies for frail older people have been reported, only a few have shown positive effects regarding disability prevention. This article presents the design of a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial on the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and feasibility of a primary care intervention that combines the most promising elements of disability prevention in community-dwelling frail older people. Methods/design In this study twelve general practitioner practices were randomly allocated to the intervention group (6 practices) or to the control group (6 practices). Three thousand four hundred ninety-eight screening questionnaires including the Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI) were sent out to identify frail older people. Based on their GFI score (≥ 5), 360 participants will be included in the study. The intervention will receive an interdisciplinary primary care intervention. After a comprehensive assessment by a practice nurse and additional assessments by other professionals, if needed, an individual action plan will be defined. The action plan is related to a flexible toolbox of interventions, which will be conducted by an interdisciplinary team. Effects of the intervention, both for the frail older people and their informal caregivers, will be measured after 6, 12 and 24 months using postal questionnaires and telephone interviews. Data for the process evaluation and economic evaluation will be gathered continuously over a 24 -month period. Discussion The proposed study will provide information about the usefulness of an interdisciplinary primary care intervention. The <b>postal</b> screening <b>procedure</b> was conducted in two cycles between December 2009 and April 2010 and {{turned out to be a}} feasible method. The response rate was 79. 7 %. According to GFI scores 29. 3 % of the respondents can be considered as frail (GFI ≥ 5). Nearly half of them (48. 1 %) were willing to participate. The baseline measurements started in January 2010. In February 2010 the first older people were approached by the practice nurse for a comprehensive assessment. Data on the effect, process, and economic evaluation will be available in 2012.
