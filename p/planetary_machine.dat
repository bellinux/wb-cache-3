40|$|The {{atmospheric}} greenhouse effect, an {{idea that}} authors trace back to the traditional works of Fourier 1824, Tyndall 1861, and Arrhenius 1896, and which is still supported in global climatology, essentially describes a fictitious mechanism, in which a planetary atmosphere acts as a heat pump driven by {{an environment that is}} radiatively interacting with but radiatively equilibrated to the atmospheric system. According to the second law of thermodynamics such a <b>planetary</b> <b>machine</b> can never exist. Nevertheless, in almost all texts of global climatology and in a widespread secondary literature it is taken for granted that such mechanism is real and stands on a firm scientific foundation.

Three surfactants {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} (SDS), polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG- 6000), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), were applied {{and the influence of}} surfactants on the properties of the strontium ferrite particles was studied. The ferrite precursors were first precalcined in a muffle furnace at 400 degrees C and then mixed with KCl and NaCl using a <b>planetary</b> milling <b>machine</b> in order to lower the calcination temperature.

In this paper, effects of Fe(3 +) /Sr(2 +) mole ratio were first verified and annealing temperatures were then discussed. The results show the strontium ferrite phase begins to form at 650 degrees C and complete at 800 degrees C after calcination, and the particles prepared using CTAB exhibit the best properties with respect to particle size and dispersibility.

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityTrochoidal-type machines belong to the category of <b>planetary</b> rotation <b>machines</b> and include pumps, blowers, compressors and engines. In general a trochoidal-type machine is simpler, quieter, lighter and smaller than a comparable reciprocating machine. This thesis focuses on two major aspects of trochoidal-type machines with conjugate envelopes: (i) the geometry and the characteristics {{of different types of}} trochoids and different types of conjugate envelopes; and (ii) methods to determine the contact forces and the contact stresses between the rotor and the chamber. The two types of trochoid are the peritrochoid and the hypotrochoid. For each type of trochoid, there are nine types of conjugate envelope. Conjugate envelopes provide, in general, the best geometry for sealing, high compression ratio and low contact forces and stresses. However, to date only two out of the nine types of conjugate envelope have been studied in any detail. General parametric equations of a conjugate envelope, in continuous form, are not available in the literature. In this thesis, unified and compact equations for the geometry and the geometric properties of trochoids are obtained. An additional type of conjugate envelope is discovered for each trochoid. Closed-form parametric equations for all nine types of conjugate envelopes, and the necessary and sufficient conditions for having a closed type 1 conjugate envelope are derived. A computer-aided design program, incorporating the equations, is developed. The characteristics and relationships of different types of trochoid and conjugate envelope are presented. Reducing the contact stresses in the trochoidal-type machine is very important because the machine can not be adjusted for wear. The main difficulty in calculating the contact forces and stresses is to determine the forces that are transmitted through each contact point. Since there are many contact points, the problem may be considered quasi-statically indeterminate. No satisfactory method of analyzing the contact forces and stresses in a trochoidal-type machine has been developed to date. Two methods to determine contact forces are developed in this thesis. One method is based on a versatile finite element model under quasi-static conditions. This model includes more detail such as the effects of contact friction and deformation, and provides contact forces and stresses everywhere. However, results need careful verification and interpretation. The other method is based on a simplified analytical model under the same conditions. This model provides physical insights to the problem and results to check the finite element model from different approaches. However, the accuracy and availability of the results is limited by additional assumptions. When the effects of contact friction and deformation are ignored, the results from both models are in good agreement. It is hoped that this thesis will prove valuable to the designer of all <b>planetary</b> rotation <b>machines,</b> especially for trochoidal-type machines with conjugate envelopes...|$|R

However, it is implemented in an electromagnetic way rather than in a mechanical way, as is the case for the Prius II with a planetary gear. In this paper, a procedure to define the technical requirements of an EVT is presented. Since the Toyota Prius II is a well-known series-parallel HEV, this vehicle is chosen as a reference. The engine, the battery and other necessary components are kept as input data. A dynamic simulation was performed in order to take into account different driving cycles.

Prior to gel-casting zeta-potential, concentration of deflocculating agent, and viscosity were optimized. A mould was designed and fabricated and a new processing route was employed to produce a homogeneous green body which was successful. Microstructure implies that the sintered body was highly porous which could not provide enough mechanical strength. However, the green product was easily machinable. XRD analysis shows no sign of oxidation of aluminium. It has to be further studied before using it for the production. In powder metallurgy, to attain proper mixing aluminium and alumina in their powdered form are milled for 1 h in a <b>planetary</b> milling <b>machine</b> with isopropyl alcohol as the wetting agent. Powders were pressed to samples of different shape and were sintered under vacuum. Normally such composites are sintered at nitrogen or argon atmosphere.

The design was successful and was able to produce a vacuum pressure of 5. 6 E- 6 mbars inside the tube.

Bending test gives the indication that the plasticity is reduced slowly by the addition of alumina into aluminium matrix. It was also found that the tribological properties can be improved by adding 20 weight % of alumina into the metal. Microstructure indicates that the alumina was well dispersed in the aluminium matrix. The composite is easily machinable with HSS tool with minimum tool wear.

In this paper, {{we present a}} system that was developed for the European Space Agency (ESA) {{for the support of}} planetary exploration. The system that is sent to the planetary surface consists of a rover and a lander. The lander contains a stereo head equipped with a pan-tilt mechanism. This vision system is used both for modeling the terrain and for localization of the rover. Both tasks are necessary for the navigation of the rover. Due to the stress that occurs during the flight, a recalibration of the stereo-vision system is required once it is deployed on the planet. Practical limitations make it unfeasible to use a known calibration pattern for this purpose; therefore, a new calibration procedure had to be developed that could work on images of the planetary environment. This automatic procedure recovers the relative orientation of the cameras and the pan and tilt axes, as well as the exterior orientation for all the images. The same images are subsequently used to reconstruct the 3 -D structure of the terrain. For this purpose, a dense stereo-matching algorithm is used that (after rectification) computes a disparity map. Finally, all the disparity maps are merged into a single digital terrain model. In this paper, a simple and elegant procedure is proposed that achieves that goal. The fact that the same images can be used for both calibration and 3 -D reconstruction is important, since, in general, the communication bandwidth is very limited. In addition to navigation and path planning, the 3 -D model of the terrain is also used for virtual-reality simulations of the mission, wherein the model is texture mapped with the original images. The system has been implemented, and the first tests on the ESA planetary terrain testbed were successful. status: publishe...|$|R
