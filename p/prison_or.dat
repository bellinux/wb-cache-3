5|$|After the December {{completion}} of the 2010 presidential election, Lukashenko was elected to a fourth straight term with nearly 80% {{of the vote in}} elections. The runner-up opposition leader Andrei Sannikov received less than 3% of the vote; independent observers criticized the election as fraudulent. When opposition protesters took to the streets in Minsk, many people, including most rival presidential candidates, were beaten and arrested by the state militia. Many of the candidates, including Sannikov, were sentenced to <b>prison</b> <b>or</b> house arrest for terms which are mainly and typically over four years. Six months later amid an unprecedented economic crisis, activists utilized social networking to initiate a fresh round of protests characterized by wordless hand-clapping.|$|E
5|$|In March 1933, {{less than}} three months after the Nazis seized power, Himmler set up the first {{official}} concentration camp at Dachau. Hitler had stated {{that he did not want}} it to be just another <b>prison</b> <b>or</b> detention camp. Himmler appointed Theodor Eicke, a convicted felon and ardent Nazi, to run the camp in June 1933. Eicke devised a system that was used as a model for future camps throughout Germany. Its features included isolation of victims from the outside world, elaborate roll calls and work details, the use of force and executions to exact obedience, and a strict disciplinary code for the guards. Uniforms were issued for prisoners and guards alike; the guards' uniforms had a special Totenkopf (death's head) insignia on their collars. By the end of 1934, Himmler took control of the camps under the aegis of the SS, creating a separate division, the SS-Totenkopfverbände.|$|E

Hayes and his staff warned the strikers about the severe penalties provided by the SmithConnally Act for disruption of the war production: the instigators could {{be subject to a}} fine of $5,000, one year in <b>prison,</b> <b>or</b> both. This prospect was made more real when the United States Attorney General Francis Biddle started an inquiry into possible violations of federal laws by the strike organizers. On August 4 the strike committee again voted to continue the strike, but, in view of the possible SmithConnally Act penalties, told the workers to make up their own minds and follow the committee if they chose. The maneuver worked and the strike continued.|$|E
5|$|Cox falsified {{documents}} {{to make it}} appear that he owned properties, and then fraudulently obtained several mortgages on them for five to six times their actual worth. He acquired millions of dollars this way; estimates report the amount at between US$5 and $25 million. Cox's first conviction occurred in 2002 when he was sentenced to probation for mortgage fraud. He was then fired from the mortgage broker position he held in a Tampa, Florida area firm. He began his life as a dedicated criminal in central Florida after that offense, before fleeing the area when his activities were discovered. His crime spree continued across the southern US, eventually landing him on the United States Secret Service's Most Wanted list. He was aided by several female accomplices, some of whom are in <b>prison</b> <b>or</b> have served time there for their participation in his fraudulent mortgage practices. Cox was arrested on November 16, 2006. Indicted on 42 counts, and facing prison sentences of up to 400 years, he plea bargained his sentence down to a maximum of 54 years on April 11, 2007 and was sentenced to 26 years on November 17, 2006. He is currently housed in a low-security prison in Florida. His story is well chronicled and has been featured on Dateline NBC, CNBC's American Greed, in Fortune magazine, Bloomberg Businessweek, Playboy magazine, and other media outlets.|$|E
