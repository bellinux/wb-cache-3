This work describes the use of spinner flask dynamic cell cultures to populate hydroxyapatite microcarriers for bone tissue engineering. The microcarriers were obtained through the emulsion of a self-setting aqueous α-tricalcium <b>phosphate</b> <b>slurry</b> in oil. After setting, hydroxyapatite microcarriers were obtained. The incorporation of gelatin in the liquid phase of the α-tricalcium <b>phosphate</b> <b>slurry</b> allowed obtaining hybrid gelatin/hydroxyapatite-microcarriers. Initial cell attachment on the microcarriers was strongly influenced by {{the speed of the}} dynamic culture, achieving higher attachment at low speed (40 r/min) as compared to high speed (80 r/min). Under moderate culture speeds (40 r/min), the number of cells present in the culture as well as the number of microcarrier-containing cells considerably increased after 3 days, particularly in the gelatin-containing microcarriers. At longer culture times in dynamic culture, hydroxyapatite-containing microcarriers formed aggregates containing viable and extracellular matrix proteins, with a significantly higher number of cells compared to static cultures...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Jorf Lasfar <b>phosphate</b> <b>slurry</b> {{pipeline}} in Morocco, commissioned in April 2014, {{is one of}} the world's largest slurry pipelines. The pipeline receives phosphate ore {{from the}} El Halassa, MEA and Daoui wash plants situated up to 22 km away. The product from these plants varies in grade and quality and is stored in separate agitated slurry tanks at the Khouribga head station. From the head station the slurry is pumped 187 km in batches separated by water to the terminal station at Jorf Lasfar. As these batches of <b>phosphate</b> <b>slurry</b> arrive at the terminal station they are diverted to dedicated storage tanks that feed separate process streams in the refinery. This means that the pipeline design needs to accommodate the slurry transport requirements of the different batches and to be able identify where these batches are during transport so as to ensure they are allocated to the appropriate tanks. As the batches are intermittent and have variable flow properties the design needs to accommodate a wide range of operating conditions. This is achieved by controlling the pipeline operation by varying the pumping head and through a series of pressure monitoring stations and a choke station at the terminal. Due to the scale of the project the system comprises some of the largest slurry handling equipment yet produced and this presented many unique challenges for the engineering team that required an innovative approach to solving such unique problems. This paper presents a few of the design and engineering challenges faced by the engineering team responsible for successfully delivering this project...|$|E

In this study, we fabricated three-dimensional macroporous scaffold by polymeric sponge method using calcium phosphate glass in CaO-CaF 2 -P 2 O 5 -MgO-ZnO. Calcium <b>phosphate</b> glass <b>slurry</b> was prepared by suspending the glass powder in water, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol and dimethyl formamide. Reticulated polyurethane sponges were used as a template and were coated with the prepared slurry by infiltration technique several times. Calcium <b>phosphate</b> glass <b>slurry</b> was homogenously thick coated when the amounts of calcium phosphate glass powder and polyvinyl alcohol were 67 and 8 wt%, respectively. Addition of 10 wt % dimethyl formamide as a drying control chemical additive into a slurry successively prevented microcrack formation. Sintering at 850 oC exhibited dense microstructures as well as entire elimination of organic additives. When the macroporous scaffolds were transplanted subcutaneously in the dorsal surface of mice, the vascularized mesenchymal stem cells were formed in the transplanted scaffolds and the regenerated connective tissue was also formed after 4 weeks. These {{results of the present}} study suggested that the fabricated macroporous scaffold is expected to be useful scaffold material for osteogenic tissue development...|$|R
40|$|Ammonium <b>phosphate</b> <b>slurries</b> are {{produced}} from impure phosphoric acid that contains Fe(III), Al(III) and Mg(II) ions. The insolubility of these metal ions and {{the onset of}} solid formation determined {{as a function of}} pH or mole ratio (MR) of ammonia to phosphoric acid were consistent with the trend for the pH of formation of the first hydrolysis product that decreases in the following order: Fe(III) 2. 0 or MR> 0. 5 initiate ammonium phosphate crystallization, reduce the size of particles formed and generate attractive interparticle forces. Similarly, the Al(III) hydrolysis products formed later at pH> 2. 6 MR> 0. 7), will also initiate further crystallization, adsorb on particles and produce attractive forces. The attractive forces and the high number concentration of particle-particle interactions are responsible for the increased viscosity and non-Newtonian flow behavior displayed at increasing Fe(III) and Al(III) concentration. Mg(II) ions are not hydrolyzed at MR< 1. 0 so its effect on rheology is negligible and its effect at MR< 1. 0 is also small as its concentration is much smaller than that of Fe(III) and Al(III) ions. The change in slurry viscosity with the degree of neutralization is also explained in terms of particle size distribution, solubility and solids concentration variations...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{constant}} 1 -MPa {{pressure filtration}} {{characteristics of a}} flocculated polydisperse <b>phosphate</b> slime <b>slurry</b> were examined {{in relation to the}} hydrodynamic conditions of the material's conditioning and its granulometric and textural properties.

The effect on the specific filtration resistance of the velocity gradient, size distribution, and porosity of the flocs was defined. With shearing at 120 - 2050 s− 1, the inter-floc porosity increases with decreasing granulometric spreading and increasing intra-floc porosity. A fairly high inter-floc porosity inevitably results in an increased permeability. The best filtration performances were obtained after a conditioning favouring the formation of a small distribution spreading index of floc size distribution and a high porosity cake...|$|R

Both oxygen and steam {{were used as}} oxidants, {{and a variety of}} reactor configurations were studied. Reactors consisted of fused ceramic parts sealed into a reactor configuration using castable refractory. The reaction rate of carbon particles in a bubbling molten <b>phosphate</b> <b>slurry</b> was found to depend upon the rate of particle-bubble contacting. Upon contact, direct conversion of carbon particles with the gas phase occurs due to the large carbon-molten sodium phosphate contact angle (136 °). The potential flow solution for flow around a bubble where particles are assumed to follow the streamlines gave a consistent picture of bubble-particle contacting. The reactivity of the carbon in the bulk liquid was found to be negligible due to the low solubility of oxygen in the melt. Gas phase (no salt) results were generated to establish base cases and to examine treatment effects on the reactivity of green sponge and green needle cokes. The reactivities of both were favorably affected by toluene extraction and adversely affected by calcination to 1300 K. Extraction decreased the agglomerating nature of the sponge coke. Both extracts were largely aromatic with the needle coke extract being more so. Molten sodium phosphate was found to catalyze the gasification of petroleum coke by steam and by oxygen. Such catalytic effects are limited due to the large carbon-salt contact angle and may be obscured in slurry reactors by the rate of particle-bubble contacting being slow. The steam reforming of residual oil revealed that the carbonized product in the molten salt phase closely resembled sponge petroleum coke (as produced by delayed coking). Cold model experiments employing water and polymeric beads revealed that dilute slurries of small, non-wetting particles decreased the rise velocity of single bubbles and increased the rate of bubble coalescence in swarms. Dilute slurries of wetting particles had no effect in either case...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of the surface treatment of titanium(Ti) with thin apatite (Ap) coating by the chemical coating process using calcium <b>phosphate</b> <b>slurry</b> on the osteoconductivity by in vivo and in vitro study. Ti wires (1 mm in diameter and 8 mm in length) and Ti discs (21. 5 mm in diameter) were buried in calcium-phosphate slurry, and subsequently heated at 973 K in air (CP-coated Ti). Annealed Ti wires and discs, which were prepared by heating at 973 K in air without the slurry, were used as control(AnnealTi). On the surface of Ti, thin coating film consisted Ap and TiO 2 with 300 nm in thickness was observed by SEM and XPS. To evaluate osteoconductivity,CP-coated Ti and Anneal Ti wires were implanted in rat femora, and histological investigation and histomorphometric evaluation was done at 2 and 8 weeks after surgery. B one marrow stromal cells in rats were cultivated on CP-coated Ti and Anneal Ti discs. The cells were then cultured for 2 and 3 weeks, and ALP activity standardized by DNA contents, osteopontin (OP), osteocalcin (OC) and calcium contents were measured biochemically. RT-PCR was done for collagen I and Cbfa 1 after cultured for 1 and 2 weeks. At 2 weeks after surgery, immature bone tissue including many osteocytes was observed around both specimens. At 8 weeks, newly formed bone on the surface of the both specimens was remodeled and thickness of it decreased. The area of the specimen directly attached to bone tissue was significantly extensive in CPcoated Ti than in Anneal Ti at both 2 and 8 weeks. In vitro study, at 2 weeks, OC and calcium contents of CP-coated Ti were significantly higher than those of Anneal Ti. At 3 weeks, all parameters of CP-coated Ti were significantly higher than those of Anneal Ti. RT-PCR showed more expression of mRNA encoding Cbfa 1 of CP-coated Ti at 1 week. It was suggested that thin Ap film by the chemical coating process was effective to enhance the osteoconductivity of Ti. この博士論文全文の閲覧方法については、以下のサイトをご参照ください。[URL]...|$|E
40|$|Phosphate Hill is a {{mine site}} located in North West Queensland. At the site, mined phosphoric rock is reacted with sulphuric acid to produce phosphoric acid. The phosphoric acid is {{combined}} with ammonia in a reactor known as the pre-neutraliser. The reaction forms a very hot and viscous slurry which is later further ammoniated in a cylindrical vessel known as a granulator, to produce solid fertiliser granules of mono-ammonium phosphate (MAP) or di-ammonium phosphate (DAP). Two important parameters used in the processing of ammonium phosphate slurries are the nitrogen to phosphorous mole ratio (MR) and the specific gravity (SG). Both of these parameters can affect the rheology of the slurry produced inside the reactor. The impurities carried over in the phosphoric acid from the reaction with the phosphate rock can also have significant effects on the rheology of the slurry. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the rheological characteristics of the ammonium phosphate slurries formed in the pre-neutraliser (PN) and determine how the viscosity changes with mole ratio, impurity composition and specific gravity. There is a lot of variability in the literature on the rheology of ammonium phosphate slurries. Previous work did not take into account the non-Newtonian nature of the slurry, whilst also basing their findings on plant based measurements, where proper control of the slurry properties would have been difficult. A bulk quantity of phosphoric acid was collected from Phosphate Hill and used as a baseline for testing the effect of adding impurities. Laboratory grade FePO 4, AlPO 4 and Mg 3 (PO 4) 2 were added to the plant acid to form acids of varying impurity content. Further to the viscosity experiments, work was conducted to determine the slurry particle size, chemical composition (by XRD/XRF analysis), solubility of precipitates and physical characteristics, in an attempt to explain the mechanisms behind the observed viscosity changes. Testing the viscosity of ammonium <b>phosphate</b> <b>slurry</b> was found to be very time consuming and problematic. The experimental work was complicated by a multitude of factors, including high temperatures, slow reaction and evaporation times, the precipitation of impurities and the solidification of the slurry. The trend in the viscosity with mole ratio for the as-received acid was similar to that seen in the literature. The addition of both aluminium and iron caused an increase in the viscosity around the MAP minimum solubility point of 0. 9 MR. In both cases, the formation of hydrolysis products were shown to have reduced the particle size of the precipitating ammonium phosphate crystals, thus increasing the viscosity. As the mole ratio is increased, mono-ammonium phosphate combines with the additional ammonia to form di-ammonium phosphate. The hydrolysis products for iron also changed at the same time and the resultant slurry formed particles with high interparticle attractive forces which in turn formed a flocculated suspension. Increasing the iron content not only increased the viscosity in this region, but also lowered the mole ratio whereby the increase in viscosity is seen to occur. An increase in the aluminium content had no effect on the viscosity at higher mole ratios. Based on the findings, it is recommended that slurries containing high iron be preferentially processed to make mono-ammonium phosphate and slurries with high aluminium be preferentially processed to make di-ammonium phosphate. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling was conducted on the mixing dynamics of the PN vessel. The CFD model showed that the upper region of the vessel was the least well mixed. The potential for stagnation of the flow field and subsequent solidification increases when the viscosity of the slurry also increases. To counteract this threat, the volume of slurry in the reactor must be decreased, or the agitation speed increased. The most effective method to ensure proper mixing dynamics in the vessel was to lower the viscosity, by preferentially processing each slurry by its impurity content as mentioned above...|$|E

These slurries consist of mullite-shelled hollow microspheres, calcium aluminate cements and polybasic sodium phosphate. When cured in hydrothermal environments, the slurries yield high strength, low permeability cements which bond well to steel casing. Two compositional factors that affect the thickening times were identified. One is the calcium aluminate cement species that serve as the base reagent in the slurry formulation, and the other is the rate of hydrothermal reaction between the microspheres and the polybasic sodium phosphate solution...|$|R

Arsenic (III) is determinated directly and total arsenic is determinated after reduction reaction. The procedure was optimized for the flow rate of NaBH 4, NaBH 4 and hydrochloric acid concentrations using a full two-level factorial and also a Box-Behnken design. Slurry preparation with hydrochloric acid in an ultrasonic bath allowed the determination of arsenic (III) with limits of detection and quantification of 0. 1 and 0. 3 μg L− 1, respectively.

However, despite the known contribution of P to the eutrophication of water bodies in Britain, such incidental transfers have received little experimental attention. To rectify this, we used lysimeter plots (each 3 × 10 m) to investigate incidental transfers in a composite of overland and lateral subsurface flow (0 – 27 cm) following the application of different P sources. The treatments used were triple super <b>phosphate</b> (TSP), dairy <b>slurry</b> (Slurry), an equal mix of TSP plus slurry (TSP + Slurry), and no P (Zero P). The treatments were applied to wet soil at a rate of 29 kg ha− 1 In the following 169 h, 48. 8 mm rainfall (intensity ≤ 3 mm h− 1) resulted in total phosphorus (TP) exports between 1. 8 and 2. 3 kg ha− 1 A single 4 -h period (with overland flow) accounted for 33 to 46 % of overall loads from the P-amended treatments. Concentrations in discharge from TSP + Slurry and TSP peaked at 11000 μg TP L− 1 (67 – 68 % as reactive P 0. 45 μm) and 20 % as RP < 0. 45 Even in subsurface flow, concentrations exceeded 3000 μg TP L− 1 for all P-amended treatments. Incidental TP concentrations in plot discharge were up to 110 -fold higher than those considered eutrophic in inland waters.

Because mercury (II) ions form strong complexes with phosphor compounds, the formation of metallic mercury vapor requires the presence of lanthanum chloride as a release agent. Thiourea increases the amount of mercury that is extracted from the solid sample to the liquid phase of the slurry. The method is established using two steps. First, the slurry is prepared using the sample, lanthanum chloride, hydrochloric acid solution and thiourea solution and is sonicated for 20 min. Afterward, mercury vapor is generated using an aliquot of the slurry {{in the presence of}} the hydrochloric acid solution and isoamylic alcohol with sodium tetrahydroborate solution as the reducing agent. The experimental conditions for slurry preparation were optimized using two-level full factorial design involving the factors: thiourea and lanthanum chloride concentrations and the duration of sonication. The method allows the determination of mercury by external calibration using aqueous standards with limits of detection and quantification of 2. 4 and 8. 2 μg kg− 1, respectively, and precision, expressed as relative standard deviation, of 6. 36 and 5. 81 % for two phosphate fertilizer samples with mercury concentrations of 0. 24 and 0. 57 mg kg− 1, respectively.

The use of electroosmosis, the electrokinetic transport of water, which is theoretically independ- ent of pore size, on the other hand can be quite slow and consume a great deal of electrical energy. However, in combining pressure and electroosmosis, an effective dewatering process is realized because the strength of each dewatering process is the weakness in the other and the combination of the two processes has no ill effect on each other. The strength of electroosmosis is in its independence of pore size, whereas pressure removes the free water from the larger pores rapidly and causes consolidation to occur. Electroosmosis has no intergranular effects, so consolidation is beneficial to the electro- osmotic process in that the pores remain saturated for a longer time, menisci do not form and an induced hydraulic gradient opposing the electroosmotic gradient is not established as soon.;The experimental program investigated the optimization of pressurized electroosmotic dewatering (PED) of ultra-fine coal suspensions. The slurry characteristics of greatest interest were the particle size distribution and zeta potential. The particle size distri- bution controls the maximum packing density and thus, the lowest pore volume, obtainable. A reduction in pore volume increases the degree of saturation for a given quantity of water. The zeta potential of a suspension directly governs the electroosmotic flow rate.;A computerized data acquisition system was built to monitor the PED tests.

Initially, cheese slurries inoculated with E. coli, S. aureus, and P. roqueforti were used as a convenient means to define the effects of a range of pressures and temperatures on the viability of these microorganisms. Cheese slurries were subjected to pressures of 50 to 800 MPa for 20 min at temperatures of 10, 20, and 30 °C. At 400 MPa, the viability of P. roqueforti in cheese slurry decreased by > 2 -log-unit cycles at 10 °C and by 6 -log-unit cycles at temperatures of 20 and 30 °C. S. aureus and E. coli were not detected after HP treatments in cheese slurry of > 600 MPa at 20 °C and > 400 MPa at 30 °C, respectively. In addition to cell death, the presence of sublethally injured cells in HP-treated slurries was demonstrated by differential plating using nonselective agar incorporating salt or glucose. Kinetic experiments of HP inactivation demonstrated that increasing the pressure from 300 to 400 MPa resulted in a higher degree of inactivation than increasing the pressurization time from 0 to 60 min, indicating a greater antimicrobial impact of pressure. Selected conditions were subsequently tested on Cheddar cheese by adding the isolates to cheese milk and pressure treating the resultant cheeses at 100 to 500 MPa for 20 min at 20 °C. The relative sensitivities of the isolates to HP in Cheddar cheese were similar to those observed in the cheese slurry, i. e., P. roqueforti was more sensitive than E. coli, which was more sensitive than S. aureus. The organisms were more sensitive to pressure in cheese than slurry, especially with E. coli. On comparison of the sensitivities of the microorganisms in a pH 5. 3 <b>phosphate</b> buffer, cheese <b>slurry,</b> and Cheddar cheese, greatest sensitivity to HP was shown in the pH 5. 3 phosphate buffer by S. aureus and P. roqueforti while greatest sensitivity to HP by E. coli was exhibited in Cheddar cheese.
