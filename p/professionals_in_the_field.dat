2500|$|In most cases, {{it seems}} that {{individuals}} set themselves up as cunning folk with no former basis or training, although others came from a family background of professional magical practitioners. One {{of the most prominent}} examples of a family dynasty of cunning people was the Harries family from Cwrt y Cadno in Wales; Henry Harries (1739â€“1805) was a yeoman farmer who had an interest in astrology and medicine but did not practice as a cunning man, whilst his son, John (1785â€“1839), and two grandsons Henry and John instead became <b>professionals</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> As Owen Davies remarked, [...] "There are a number of reasons why people may have wanted to become cunning-folk. The desire for money, power or social prestige, and even to do good, all undoubtedly played their part." [...] Whether they genuinely believed that they had magical powers or not varied from practitioner to practitioner, with some later admitting in court that they didn't have powers but were simply pretending that they did in order to fool people for their money. Indeed, {{there was a great deal}} of variability amongst the British cunning folk, with historian Ronald Hutton remarking that [...] "they appear as a remarkably heterogeneous collection of individuals, divided by at least as many characteristics as those which they had in common." ...|$|E
