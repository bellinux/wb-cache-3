40|$|The thermal and {{thermomechanical}} {{properties of}} <b>poly(phenylene</b> <b>sulphide)</b> (PPS) based nanocomposites incorporating a polymer derivative covalently anchored onto single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were investigated.

A strong rise in the thermal conductivity, Young?s modulus and tensile strength was found with increasing filler loading both in the glassy and rubbery states.

Efficient nanoparticle dispersion within the matrix was attained without using surfactants. A progressive rise in thermal stability was found with increasing IF-WS 2 loading, as revealed by thermogravimetric analysis. The addition of low nanoparticle contents retarded the crystallization of the matrix, whereas concentrations equal or higher than 1. 0 wt% increased both the crystallization temperature and degree of crystallinity compared to those of PPS/CF. Mechanical tests indicated that with only 1. 0 wt% IF-WS 2 the flexural modulus and strength of PPS/CF improved by 17 and 14 %, respectively, without loss in toughness, ascribed to a synergistic effect between the two fillers. A significant enhancement in the storage modulus and glass transition temperature was also observed.

The characterisation through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, thermogravimetric analysis and Kaiser test corroborated the success of the grafting reactions, and allowed the identification and quantification of the covalent moieties. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy indicated an increase in the bundle diameter of the SWCNTs upon anchoring of the polymer chains. The results showed that the storage modulus, glass transition temperature and electrical conductivity of the polymer were exceptionally enhanced by the attachment to the SWCNTs. In contrast, the crystallization and melting temperature, degree of crystallinity and crystal size considerably decreased, as revealed by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction experiments, due to the inactive nucleating role of these SWCNTs and the intense restrictions on chain mobility imposed by the SWCNT-polymer interactions. Acid-functionalized SWCNTs were more effective for reinforcing PPS-NH 2 than epoxy-functionalized SWCNTs, attributed to the formation of a larger number of covalent bonds, albeit led to a smaller increase in the electrical conductivity of the polymer.

The effectiveness of employing a dual-nanofiller strategy combining polyetherimide (PEI) -wrapped SWCNTs with inorganic fullerene-like tungsten disulfide (IF-WS 2) nanoparticles for property enhancement of the resulting hybrid composites was evaluated. Viscoelastic measurements revealed that the complex viscosity ?, storage modulus G?, and loss modulus G? increased with SWCNT content. In the low-frequency region, G? and G? became almost independent of frequency at higher SWCNT loadings, suggesting a transition from liquid-like to solid-like behavior. The incorporation of increasing IF-WS 2 contents led to a progressive drop in ? and G? due to a lubricant effect. PEEK nanocomposites showed lower percolation threshold than those based on PPS, ascribed to an improved SWCNT dispersion due to the higher affinity between PEI and PEEK. The SWCNTs significantly lowered the wear rate but only slightly reduced the coefficient of friction. Composites with both nanofillers exhibited improved wear behavior, attributed to the outstanding tribological properties of these nanoparticles and a synergistic reinforcement effect.

In this paper, {{the influence of}} silicon carbide (SiC) and vapour growth carbon fiber (VGCF) particles on <b>polyphenylene</b> <b>sulphide</b> (PPS) crystallization and composite properties was studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXRD), Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis (DMTA) and polarizing optical microscope (POM). The results indicate that both SiC and VGCF accelerate the crystallization rate of PPS. Isothermal crystallization studies {{were used to determine}} the Avrami exponents of VGCF/PPS composites; n 2. 04 - 2. 09, SiC/PPS composites; n = 2. 45 - 2. 53, and neat PPS n = 2. 11. These results indicate that the crystals in VGCF/PPS composites grew in one or two directions while the crystals in the SiC/PPS composite grew in more than two directions. Light microscopy and SEM were used to study the crystal morphologies and dispersion of VGCF/PPS and SiC/PPS composites. Transcrystallization was found on the surface of VGCF in the VGCF/PPS composites while the size of PPS spherulite crystals was reduced after addition of SiC into PPS. VGCF was well dispersed in the PPS whereas the SiC/PPS composites contained agglomerates. This study shows that the type of filler strongly influenced the crystallisation behaviour and morphology of the PPS composites...|$|R
