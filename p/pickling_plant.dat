5|$|Responsibility for {{the design}} and {{construction}} of the electromagnetic separation plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which {{came to be called}} Y-12, was assigned to Stone & Webster. The design called for five first-stage processing units, known as Alpha racetracks, and two units for final processing, known as Beta racetracks. In September 1943 Groves authorized construction of four more racetracks, known as Alpha II. When the plant was started up for testing on schedule in October 1943, the 14-ton vacuum tanks crept out of alignment because {{of the power of the}} magnets, and had to be fastened more securely. A more serious problem arose when the magnetic coils started shorting out. In December Groves ordered a magnet to be broken open, and handfuls of rust were found inside. Groves then ordered the racetracks to be torn down and the magnets sent back to the factory to be cleaned. A <b>pickling</b> <b>plant</b> was established on-site to clean the pipes and fittings.|$|E

Experts were brought from France to supervise the work. Calling themselves the Los Angeles Olive Growers Association (in 1898 C.O. (Paul) Milltimore was the president and George L. Arnold the secretary), they built a packing plant and sold olives under the Tyler Olives label, later changing to the Sylmar Packing label. Sylmar’s olives became noted throughout the state for sweetness and purity. Chinese pickers were hired to harvest the crops, and up to 800 U.S. gallons (3,000 L) of olive oil a day were produced. The <b>pickling</b> <b>plant</b> was located {{on the corner of}} Roxford Street and San Fernando Road.

40|$|Angiosperm {{reproduction}} {{requires the}} integrated development of multiple tissues with different genotypes. To achieve successful fertilization, the haploid female gametophytes and diploid ovary must coordinate their development, {{after which the}} male gametes must navigate through the maternal sporophytic tissues to reach the female gametes. After fertilization, seed development requires coordinated development of the maternal diploid integuments, the triploid endosperm, and the diploid zygote. Transcription and signaling factors contribute to communication between these tissues, and roles for epigenetic regulation have been described {{for some of these}} processes. Here we identify a broad role for CHD 3 chromatin remodelers in Arabidopsis thaliana reproductive development. Plants lacking the CHD 3 remodeler, PICKLE, exhibit various reproductive defects including abnormal development of the integuments, female gametophyte, and pollen tube, as well as delayed progression of ovule and embryo development. Genetic analyses demonstrate that these phenotypes result from loss of PICKLE in the maternal sporophyte. The paralogous gene PICKLE RELATED 2 is preferentially expressed in the endosperm and acts antagonistically with respect to PICKLE in the seed: loss of PICKLE RELATED 2 suppresses the large seed phenotype of pickle seeds. Surprisingly, the alteration of seed size in <b>pickle</b> <b>plants</b> is sufficient to determine the expression of embryonic traits in the seedling primary root. These findings establish an important role for CHD 3 remodelers in plant reproduction and highlight how the epigenetic status of one tissue can impact the development of genetically distinct tissues...|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-1920s, Shikrey Baddour, a Lebanese {{immigrant}} from nearby Goldsboro, first saw {{opportunity in the}} wasted cucumber crops of area farmers.

40|$|Since {{stainless}} steel must be rinsed with water after pickling operation with mixtures of nitric and hydrofluoric acids, {{the present investigation}} was undertaken to define a major step towards the close loop circulation of water in steel plant. This {{can be done by}} a new procedure for removing also nitrates from rinse water {{in such a way that}} clean water can be recycled back to rinsing use. The concentrated part of used rinse water will be fed to <b>pickling</b> acid regeneration <b>plant,</b> where nitric and hydrofluoric acids can be separate and recycled back to the pickling use. The tests were carried out mainly in one of Outokumpu’s production plants in Sweden. Membrane technique was used for rinse water treatment. A filtering system based on reverse osmosis was developed to separate the acids and metals from the rinsing water. A pre-filtering method necessary for reverse osmosis was tested. Since the composition of permeate is not applicable for direct reusage in the rinsing zone, post-treatment methods were examined. Amberlite IRA 67 ion exchange resin was tested for treatment of reverse osmosis filtrate (pH adjustment). For the recovery of the mixed acids, the concentrate of reverse osmosis was further treated with electrodialysis.

Testing included six cultivars of tomato (Red Robin, Scarlet Sweet 'N' Neat, Tiny Tim, Mohamed, Patio Princess, and Tumbler) and six cultivars of pepper (Red Skin, Fruit Basket, Cajun Belle, Chablis, Sweet <b>Pickle,</b> and Pompeii). <b>Plants</b> were grown to an age sufficient to produce fruit (up to 106 days for tomato and 109 days for pepper) using Turface (arcillite) potting media with 18 - 6 - 8 control-release fertilizer and supplemental nutrient solution beginning around 60 -days-age. Tomato fruits were harvested when they showed full red color, beginning around 70 -days age and then at weekly intervals thereafter, while peppers were grown until fruits showed color and were harvested twice (first test) and just once {{at the end of the}} second test, with the final harvests including colored and green fruit. Plant sizes, yields, and nutritional attributes were measured and used to down-select to three cultivars for each species. In particular, we were interested in cultivars that were short (dwarf) but still produced high yields. Nutritional data included elemental (Ca, Mg, Fe, and K) content, vitamin K, phenolics, lycopene (for tomato), anthocyanin, lutein, and zeaxanthin. The three down-selected cultivars for each species were grown again and the harvested fruit sent to NASA's Johnson Space Center for sensory evaluation, which included overall acceptability, appearance, color intensity, aroma, flavor and texture. The combined data were compared and given weighting factors to rank the cultivars as candidates for testing in space. Weightings gave maximum importance to plant size (smaller being good) and fruit yield (greater yields being good). For tomato, the ranking was 1) cultivar Mohamed and cultivar Red Robin (tied), and 3) cultivar Sweet N' Neat. For pepper, the ranking was 1) cultivar Pompeii, 2) cultivar Red Skin, and 3) cultivar Fruit Basket. These rankings are somewhat subjective but provide a starting point for conducting higher fidelity testing with these crops (e. g., testing with light emitting diode lighting similar to the Veggie plant unit on ISS), and ultimately conducting a flight experiment...|$|R
