Depending on the commercial results, Universal alternatively argued to the courts, first, that King Kong was a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> domain, and then second, that King Kong was not <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> domain, and that Universal possessed exclusive trademark rights in it. Universal's assertions in court were based not on any good faith belief in their truth, but on the mistaken belief that it could use the courts to turn a profit.|$|E
