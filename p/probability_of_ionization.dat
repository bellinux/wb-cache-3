Multiple ionization of xenon by 50 fs 790 nm, linearly and circularly polarized laser pulses is observed over the intensity range 10 TW/cm^ 2 to 10 PW/cm^ 2 using Effective Intensity Matching (EIM), which is coupled with Intensity Selective Scanning (ISS) to recover the geometry-independent <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>ionization.</b> Such measurements, made possible by quantifying diffraction effects in the laser focus, are compared directly to theoretical predictions of multiphoton, tunnel and field ionization, and a remarkable agreement demonstrated.

The lighter propellants such as krypton and cadmium are favorable for high-Isp, low-thrust applications, whereas heavier propellants such as mercury and bismuth are preferable for low-Isp, high-thrust missions. Calculations of the ionizing collision rate show that cesium had the highest ionization probability (and lowest ionization energy), krypton had the lowest probability (and highest ionization energy), with the other propellant falling between cesium and krypton.

The present paper discusses particle control of hydrogen/deuterium by wall pumping on graphite or carbonized surfaces, {{as well as by}} external exhaust with pumped limiters and pumped divertors. Wall pumping is ultimately a transient effect and by itself not suitable for steady state particle exhaust. Therefore, external exhaust techniques with pumped divertors and limiters are being developed. How wall pumping phenomena interact and correlate with these inherently steady state, external exhaust techniques, is not well known to date. In the present paper, the processes involved in wall pumping and in external pumping are investigated in an attempt to evaluate the effect of external exhaust on wall pumping. Some of the key elements of this analysis are: (1) charge-exchange fluxes to the wall {{play a crucial role in}} the core-wall particle dynamics, (2) the recycling fluxes of thermal molecules have a high <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>ionization</b> in the scrape-off layer, (3) thermal particles originating from the wall, which are ionized within the scrape-off layer, can be directly exhausted, thus providing a direct path between wall and exhaust which can be used to control the wall inventory. This way, the wall can be kept in a continuous pumping state in the sense that it continuously absorbs energetic particles and releases thermal molecules which are then removed by the external exhaust mechanism. While most of the ingredients of this analysis have been observed individually before, the present evaluation is an attempt to correlate effects of wall recycling and external exhaust...|$|E
40|$|HiPIMS, {{high power}} impulse {{magnetron}} sputtering, is a promising technology that {{has attracted a}} lot of attention, ever since it was introduced in 1999. A time-dependent plasma discharge model has been developed for the ionization region (IRM) in HiPIMS discharges. As a flexible modeling tool, {{it can be used}} to explore the temporal variations of the ionized fractions of the working gas and the sputtered vapor, the electron density and temperature, the gas rarefaction and refill processes, the heating mechanisms, and the self-sputtering process etc [...] The model development has proceeded in steps. A basic version IRM I is fitted to the experimental data from a HiPIMS discharge with 100 μs long pulses and an aluminum target (Paper I). A close fit to the experimental current waveform, and values of density, temperature, gas rarefaction, as well as the degree of ionization shows the general validity of the model. An improved version, IRM II is first used for an investigation of reasons for deposition rate loss in the same discharge (Paper II). This work contains a preliminary analysis of the potential distribution and its evolution as well as the possibility of a high deposition rate window to optimize the HiPIMS discharge. IRM II is then fitted to another HiPIMS discharge with 400 μs long pulses and an aluminum target and used to investigate gas rarefaction, degree of ionization, degree of self-sputtering, and the loss in deposition rate (Paper III). The most complete version, IRM III is also applied to these 400 μs long pulse discharges but in a larger power density range, from the pulsed dcMS range 0. 026 kW/up to 3. 6 kW/where gas rarefaction and self-sputtering are important processes. It is in Paper IV used to study the Ohmic heating mechanism in the bulk plasma, couple to the potential distribution in the ionization region, and compare the efficiencies of different mechanisms for electron heating and their resulting relative contributions to ionization. Then, in Paper V, the particle balance and discharge characteristics on the road to self-sputtering are studied. We find that a transition to a discharge mode where self-sputtering dominates always happens early, typically one third into the rising flank of an initial current peak. It is not driven by process gas rarefaction, instead gas rarefaction develops when the discharge already is in the self-sputtering regime. The degree of self-sputtering increases with power: at low powers mainly due to an increasing <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>ionization</b> of the sputtered material, and at high powers mainly due to an increasing self-sputter yield in the sheath. Besides this IRM modeling, the transport of charged particles has been investigated byiv measuring current distributions in HiPIMS discharges with 200 μs long pulses and a copper target (Paper VI). A description, based on three different types of current systems during the ignition, transition and steady state phase, is used to analyze the evolution of the current density distribution in the pulsed plasma. The internal current density ratio (Hall current density divided by discharge current density) is a key transport parameter. It is reported how it varies with space and time, governing the cross-B resistivity and the mobility of the charged particles. From the current ratio, the electron cross-B (Pedersen) conductivity can be obtained and used as essential input when modeling the axial electric field that was the subject of Papers II and IV, and which governs the back-attraction of ions.

While indirect damage by free radicals, particularly by the hydroxyl radical generated by electron collision with water. is relatively well studied, damage by direct electron collision with DNA is less well understood. Only recently Boudaiffa et al. demonstrated that electrons at energies well below ionization thresholds can induce substantial yields of single- and double-strand breaks in DNA by a resonant, dissociative attachment process. This study attracted renewed interest in electron collisions with DNA, especially in the low energy region. At higher energies ionization becomes important. While Monte Carlo track simulations of radiation damage always include <b>ionization,</b> the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> dissociative <b>ionization,</b> i. e., simultaneous ionization and dissociation, is ignored.

General definitions for the differential <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> above-threshold <b>ionization</b> and for the yield of high-order-harmonic generation (HHG) are presented. For HHG we then derive detailed analytic expressions for the spectral density of generated radiation {{in terms of the}} key laser parameters, including the number N of optical cycles in the pulse and the carrier-envelope phase (CEP). In particular, in the tunneling approximation, we provide detailed derivations of the closed-form formulas presented briefly by M. V. Frolov et al. [Phys. Rev. A 83, 021405 (R) (2011) ], which were used to describe key features of HHG by both H and Xe atom targets in an intense, few-cycle laser pulse. We then provide a complete analysis of the dependence of the HHG spectrum on both N and the CEP φ of an N-cycle laser pulse. Most importantly, we show analytically that the structure of the HHG spectrum stems from interference between electron wave packets originating from electron ionization from neighboring half-cycles near the peak of the intensity envelope of the few-cycle laser pulse. Such interference is shown to be very sensitive to the CEP. The usual HHG spectrum for a monochromatic driving laser field (comprising harmonic peaks at odd multiples of the carrier frequency and spaced by twice the carrier frequency) is shown analytically to occur only in the limit of very large N, and begins to form, as N increases, in the energy region beyond the HHG plateau cutoff...|$|R

Photovoltaic devices harvest the sun’s energy to produce electricity and produce very little pollution compared to nonrenewable sources. In order to make these devices affordable, however, technological advances are required. 	In this dissertation a novel photovoltaic device architecture that is designed to enhance sunlight-to-electricity conversion efficiency of photovoltaics is proposed and demonstrated. The increase in efficiency arises due to enhancement of the internal quantum efficiency of photoexcitation in the semiconductor absorber. In other words, the probability that the absorption of a single photon will produce two or more electron-hole pairs, instead of just one, is increased. This occurs through the process <b>of</b> impact <b>ionization,</b> by which a highly excited charge carrier (via absorption of a high energy photon) relaxes by excitation of a second electron-hole pair. The result is an increased photocurrent, and efficiency, of the photovoltaic device. 	Using thin films of ZnS on Si substrates, we demonstrate that the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> impact <b>ionization</b> is enhanced at the (unbiased) heterojunction between these layers. The magnitude of enhancement depends on material properties, including crystallinity of the ZnS film as well as concentration of oxygen (impurity) at the interface. Thin films of ZnSe on Si substrates do not exhibit heterojunction-assisted impact ionization, but they do display promising characteristics that make them an intriguing system for future work. The same is true for ZnS/Si materials fabricated by O 2 -free chemical bath deposition. For the analysis of plain Si as well as ZnS/Si and ZnSe/Si heterostructures, we employ a novel pump-probe transient transmission and reflection spectroscopy technique. A method is demonstrated for using this technique to quantify internal quantum efficiency as well as interface recombination velocity in each of these materials. In bulk silicon, a free carrier absorption cross section that depends on free carrier concentration (above 1018 cm- 3) is observed and the relationship is quantified.

Ionization in Neptune's plasma sheet was modeled using Voyager plasma observations. Collisions cause both the H and N neutral clouds to become more radially extended, both toward Neptune and out beyond the magnetopause, {{as well as more}} extended in latitude, when compared with collisionless models. Moreover, collisions of H with the much more massive N greatly enhance the collisional ejection of H from the system and into Neptune's atmosphere. This effect decreases the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> H <b>ionization</b> within the magnetosphere relative to that for N, and furthermore causes model results for two-species injection from Triton to differ significantly from those for H injection alone.

Significant differences {{are found in the}} vicinity of autoionizing resonances. Owing to the broad bandwidths of our 115 and 230 as pulses and their high intensities (1 – 2 PWcm− 2), asymmetries are found in the differential <b>probability</b> for <b>ionization</b> <b>of</b> electrons parallel and antiparallel to the linear polarization axis of the laser pulse. These asymmetries stem from interference of the one- and two-photon ionization amplitudes for producing electrons with the same momentum along the linear polarization axis. Whereas these asymmetries generally decrease with increasing ionized electron kinetic energy, we find a large enhancement of the asymmetry in the vicinity of two-electron doubly excited (autoionizing) states on an energy scale comparable to the widths of the autoionizing states. The CEP dependence of the energy-integrated asymmetry agrees very well with the predictions of time-dependent perturbation theory (Pronin et al 2009 Phys. Rev. A 80 063403) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} {{consideration}} <b>of</b> the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> interstellar wind H and He atoms' survival <b>of</b> <b>ionization</b> by solar wind electrons, a dual temperature electron distribution {{is for the}} first time used to model the effects of 'core' (10 eV) and 'halo' (60 eV) solar electrons on survival probabilities. The interstellar wind has a higher <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> surviving halo rather than core electron ionization only at heliocentric distances smaller than 0. 5 AU. For larger distances, halo and core survival probabilities are similar, and similarly insensitive to changes in (1) interstellar wind velocity at infinity, (2) the solar ratio of radiation to gravitational force, and (3) solar electron temperatures. At distances smaller than 0. 5 AU, however, sensitivity significantly increases...|$|R
40|$|The {{product of}} two {{empirical}} relations, for the practical range and the transmission <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> normally incident electrons through plane sheets of matter, may be differentiated {{to yield a}} simple formulation of the energy deposition by electron beams, in agreement with more complex formulations and with experimental data. When combined with the δ-ray distribution formula, these results provide a theory of the spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>ionization</b> energy about {{the path of a}} rapidly moving ion, which is basic to theories of radiation damage and detection...|$|R
30|$|The {{orbital element}} {{distributions}} of meteoroids detected during the Harvard Radio Meteor Project, 1968 – 69 Synoptic Year Program, have been reanalysed to remove selection effects {{associated with the}} radar observations. Corrections are made for the observing schedule, antenna beampatterns, the radio diffusion ceiling, speed dependence <b>of</b> <b>ionization</b> production, the flux enhancement due to the Earth’s gravity and the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> encounter with the Earth. These render the eccentricity, aphelion distance, and inclination distributions for meteoroids larger than 10 − 4 g (radius ∼ 200 μm), with orbits that cross the ecliptic near 1 AU.|$|R
