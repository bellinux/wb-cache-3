5|$|After the war ended, {{service members}} {{returned}} to the area, spurring an enormous <b>population</b> <b>explosion</b> which dwarfed the 1920s boom. The 1960 Census counted 83,648 people in the city, about 230% of the 1950 figure. A 1967 report estimated {{that the city was}} approximately 85% developed, and the 1970 population figure was 139,590.|$|E
5|$|In 1887 the {{population}} of the parish was 528. By 1896, {{the population}} had grown to 585. The population fluctuated steadily around 550 until the 1950s and 1960s, when a <b>population</b> <b>explosion</b> resulted in the 1961 UK census reporting 2,186 residents in the parish. This coincides {{with the opening of the}} Atomic Weapons Establishment in the early 1950s, and the majority of this figure counts residents in the parts of Tadley within the parish of Aldermaston—between 1901 and 1961, 368 houses were built in the parish.|$|E
5|$|The South Staffordshire Railway reached Brownhills in 1850 {{and led to}} a huge {{expansion}} of the local mining operation and with it a <b>population</b> <b>explosion</b> in the area, with the population increasing from 305 in 1801 to over 13,000 in 1891. In 1858 a branch line was constructed through the heart of what was then the hamlet of Brownhills, which led to a migration of the population eastwards, leading to the formation of mining slums in the Ogley Hay area. Eventually a new town centre developed, complete with library and theatre. This led to the gradual amalgamation of Brownhills, Ogley Hay and Catshill into one town.|$|E
50|$|The California {{tortoiseshell}} {{is known}} for having <b>population</b> <b>explosions</b> which cause the butterflies to migrate to new areas. The cause of these <b>population</b> <b>explosions</b> is unknown. Their larvae eat various species of Ceanothus.|$|R

5|$|Bellaire's {{population}} had reached 1,124 in 1940. After 1940, Bellaire had a rapid <b>population</b> <b>explosion</b> in the post-World War II building boom. On December 31, 1948, {{the city of}} Houston had annexed the land around the city of Bellaire, stopping the city of Bellaire's land growth. Bellaire remained independent of Houston; Bellaire adopted a home rule charter with a council-manager government in April 1949. By 1950 the city's residents had numbered 10,173, and there were 3,186 houses. However each subsequent {{year for the next}} two years, an additional 600 to 700 new houses opened. Due to the resulting population increase, several schools, including Bellaire High School, Marion High School, and two elementary schools, were established in that period, and Condit Elementary received a new addition. In the 1960s 250 houses in Bellaire were demolished {{to make way for the}} right of way of the 610 Loop, which bisected the city.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{industrialisation}} {{of nearby}} Northwest England, and its needs for mineral supplies, the mineral deposits in the Alyn valley created a <b>population</b> <b>explosion</b> in various villages, including Rhydymwyn. From the mid-18th century, Rhydymwyn {{was the site}} {{for a range of}} industries, which included foundries, waterwheels as well as mine workings.|$|E
25|$|During a <b>population</b> <b>explosion,</b> {{like those}} of the common banded awl (Hasora chromus), the {{caterpillars}} of the brown awl may strip away all their food supply forcing the butterflies to migrate to other places where a fresh supply of host plants is available and even to other habitats such as shrubs, grasslands and gardens.|$|E
5000|$|Based {{on current}} {{knowledge}} of extant uraniine species, {{it is likely}} that Sloane's urania migrated between patches of host plants, after <b>population</b> <b>explosions</b> locally defoliated them. This probably required relatively large, intact areas of lowland forest.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} {{found on the}} Pacific coast of North America. This Donax species, known for its {{periodic}} <b>population</b> <b>explosions,</b> was eaten by Native Americans in Southern California, particularly the Luiseno and Kumeyaay Indians of San Diego County.|$|R
50|$|While the {{phenomenon}} {{is often associated with}} rodents, it does occur in other species such as the ruffed grouse. There are other species which have irregular <b>population</b> <b>explosions</b> such as grasshoppers where overpopulation results in locust swarms in Africa and Australia.|$|R
25|$|There is an {{increasingly}} likely <b>population</b> <b>explosion</b> in Saskatchewan {{cities and towns}} as the economy continues to boom at a rate unprecedented since the 1920s. Regina urban planners confront the issue of making new Regina neighbourhoods suitably comfortable for Saskatchewan expatriates long resident elsewhere in North America and now returning {{to live in the}} province.|$|E
25|$|The fishery {{has yet to}} recover, and may {{not recover}} at all because of a {{possibly}} stable change in the food chain. Atlantic cod was a top-tier predator, along with haddock, flounder and hake, feeding upon smaller prey such as herring, capelin, shrimp and snow crab. With the large predatory fish removed, their prey has had a <b>population</b> <b>explosion</b> and have become the top predators.|$|E
25|$|A {{predominantly}} {{rural community}} {{for most of}} its existence, Naperville experienced a <b>population</b> <b>explosion</b> beginning in the 1960s and continuing into the 1980s and 1990s, following the construction of the East-West Tollway (now known as the Ronald Reagan Memorial Tollway) and Interstate 355 (originally known as the North-South Tollway, now the Veterans Memorial Tollway). It has nearly quadrupled in size as the Chicago metropolitan area's urban sprawl brought corporations, jobs, and wealth to the area.|$|E
50|$|It {{is normal}} for {{animals such as}} mice, rats, flies, and parasites to {{participate}} in the fully natural biological waste recycling process. Engineered facilities typically attempt to exclude them to prevent out of control <b>population</b> <b>explosions</b> and infestation, and prevent spread of vermin and disease.|$|R
50|$|Found in half shady, damp locations, such as forest {{edges and}} hedges with their food plants, {{but also in}} avenues, parks and gardens. They are common, but only occur in small numbers. Leucoma salicis is also {{reported}} from outbreaks (<b>population</b> <b>explosions),</b> but these are known only from historical times.|$|R
5000|$|This {{dual phase}} {{process in the}} {{landscape}} explains the consist appearance of pollen zones in the postglacial forest history of North America, Europe, {{as well as the}} suppression of widespread taxa, such as beech and hemlock, followed by huge <b>population</b> <b>explosions.</b> Similar patterns, pollen zones truncated by fire-induced boundaries, have been recorded {{in most parts of the}} world ...|$|R
25|$|First {{built in}} the 1920s, the ranch style was {{extremely}} popular with the booming post-war middle class of the 1940s to 1970s. The style {{is often associated with}} tract housing built at this time, particularly in the southern and western United States, which experienced a <b>population</b> <b>explosion</b> during this period, with a corresponding demand for housing. The style was exported to other nations. Their popularity waned in the late 20th century as neo-eclectic house styles, a return to using historical and traditional decoration, became popular.|$|E
25|$|Coral reefs {{are dying}} around the world. In particular, coral mining, {{agricultural}} and urban runoff, pollution (organic and inorganic), overfishing, blast fishing, disease, and the digging of canals and access into islands and bays are localized threats to coral ecosystems. Broader threats are sea temperature rise, sea level rise and pH changes from ocean acidification, all associated with greenhouse gas emissions. A 2014 study lists {{factors such as}} <b>population</b> <b>explosion</b> along the coast lines, overfishing, the pollution of coastal areas, global warming and invasive species among the main reasons that have put reefs in danger of extinction.|$|E
25|$|About 50,000 years ago, {{there was}} a marked {{increase}} in the diversity of artifacts. For {{the first time in}} Africa, bone artifacts and the first art appear in the archaeological record. The first evidence of human fishing is also noted, from artifacts in places such as Blombos cave in South Africa. Firstly among the artifacts of Africa, archaeologists found they could differentiate and classify those of less than 50,000 years into many different categories, such as projectile points, engraving tools, knife blades, and drilling and piercing tools. The new technology generated a <b>population</b> <b>explosion</b> of modern humans which is believed to have led to the extinction of the Neanderthals.|$|E
50|$|From a {{historical}} perspective, technological revolutions have coincided with <b>population</b> <b>explosions.</b> There {{have been three}} major technological revolutions - the tool-making revolution, the agricultural revolution, and the industrial revolution - all of which allowed humans more access to food, resulting in subsequent <b>population</b> <b>explosions.</b> For example, the use of tools, such as bow and arrow, allowed primitive hunters greater access to high energy foods (e.g. animal meat). Similarly, the transition to farming about 10,000 years ago greatly increased the overall food supply, which was used to support more people. Food production further increased with the industrial revolution as machinery, fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides were used to increase land under cultivation as well as crop yields. In short, similar to bacteria that multiply in response to increased food supply, humans have increased their population as soon as food became more abundant {{as a result of}} technological innovations.|$|R
50|$|Moths also {{undertake}} migrations, {{an example}} being the uraniids. Urania fulgens undergoes <b>population</b> <b>explosions</b> and massive migrations {{that may be}} not surpassed by any other insect in the Neotropics. In Costa Rica and Panama, the first population movements may begin in July and early August and depending on the year, may be very massive, continuing unabated {{for as long as}} five months.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Population</b> <b>explosions</b> of {{it usually}} occur {{the summer after}} the {{caterpillars}} are plentiful. The friendly fly {{can be a real}} nuisance, but they don't bite, nor do they spread disease. It is sometimes called the [...] "government fly" [...] because when outbreaks of it occur, the rumor goes around that they were released by some government agency in a misguided environmental program.|$|R
25|$|In 1838, Elizabeth Underwood, then {{owner of}} Ashfield Park, {{subdivided}} {{part of her}} land to form the village of Ashfield between Liverpool Rd and Alt St. Part of the subdivision was the building of St John's Church in Alt St in 1841. This is the oldest surviving building in Ashfield. By 1855, the village had about 70 houses and 200 residents. However, {{the opening of the}} Sydney-Parramatta railway line that year, with Ashfield as one of its six original stations, led to a <b>population</b> <b>explosion.</b> In 1872, there were enough residents for the area to be granted a municipal council. By 1890, the population had grown to 11,000.|$|E
25|$|One {{example of}} an {{invasive}} species that has {{had a significant impact}} on the landscape is the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar). The foliage-feeding gypsy moth is originally from temperate Eurasia; it was intentionally brought to the United States by an entomologist in 1869. Many specimens escaped from captivity and have since changed the ecology of deciduous and coniferous forests in North America by defoliation. This has led not only to the loss of wildlife habitat, but also other forest services, such as carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling. After its initial introduction, the continued accidental transport of its larvae across North America has contributed to its <b>population</b> <b>explosion.</b>|$|E
25|$|Technological {{advances}} {{over several}} millennia gave humans increasing {{control over the}} environment. But it was the Western industrial revolution of the 18th to 19th centuries that tapped into the vast growth potential of the energy in fossil fuels. Coal was used to power ever more efficient engines and later to generate electricity. Modern sanitation systems and advances in medicine protected large populations from disease. Such conditions led to a human <b>population</b> <b>explosion</b> and unprecedented industrial, technological and scientific growth that has continued to this day, marking the commencement of a period of global human influence known as the Anthropocene. From 1650 to 1850 the global population doubled from around 500 million to 1 billion people.|$|E

2500|$|Among the {{problems}} and miscalculations encountered in the first mission were overstocked fish dying and clogging filtration systems, unanticipated condensation making the [...] "desert" [...] too wet, <b>population</b> <b>explosions</b> of greenhouse ants and cockroaches, and morning glories overgrowing the [...] "rainforest", blocking out other plants. In addition, construction itself was a challenge; for example, {{it was difficult to}} manipulate the bodies of water to have waves and tidal changes.|$|R
25|$|The 18th century {{brought the}} first {{industrial}} {{development for the}} area when the Sandbed Wheel of the Sandbed Tilt Company was constructed on the Don just upstream from Hillfoot Bridge. Further development continued when the Neepsend Tannery was opened in 1821, the 1853 OS map showing the Neepsend Tavern and a brewery on Rutland Road. The adjacent Kelham Island district was one of Sheffield’s most important early industrial areas; it now houses the Kelham Island Museum. With a <b>population</b> <b>explosion</b> in Sheffield, Neepsend was radically changed {{in the second half}} of the 19th century. In 1852, Neepsend Gas Works, one of the area's most famous landmarks, was built by the newly formed Gas Consumers Company.|$|E
25|$|Lobsters are omnivores and {{typically}} eat live prey such as fish, mollusks, other crustaceans, worms, and some plant life. They scavenge if necessary, and {{are known to}} resort to cannibalism in captivity. However, when lobster skin is found in lobster stomachs, {{this is not necessarily}} evidence of cannibalism – lobsters eat their shed skin after moulting. While cannibalism was thought to be nonexistent among wild lobster populations, it was observed in 2012 by researchers studying wild lobsters in Maine. These first known instances of lobster cannibalism in the wild are theorized to be attributed to a local <b>population</b> <b>explosion</b> among lobsters caused by the disappearance of many of the Maine lobsters' natural predators.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} {{following}} its opening in 1927, {{the high school}} physical plant was more than sufficient {{for the needs of}} its population. Although four classrooms and a shop were added to the structure in 1939, it was not until 1958 that a large addition (now C Wing) was constructed to accommodate a burgeoning student body. By 1964, the dimensions of a new <b>population</b> <b>explosion</b> were perceived, and a special Board of Education committee was formed to investigate the needs of Columbia High School in the 1970s. As a result of this study, it was calculated that further additions would be required. During the 1970−71 school year, B and D Wings were added at a total cost of $5,250,000.|$|E

Atlantic cod was a top-tier predator, along with haddock, flounder and hake, feeding upon smaller prey, such as herring, capelin, shrimp, and snow crab.

50|$|In tundra regions, this vole {{exhibits}} outbreaks {{when its}} numbers increase substantially. These {{occur in a}} four to five-year population cycle the reasons for which are not fully understood but which may reflect changes in the abundance of certain specialised predators. Lemmings have similar but more violent <b>population</b> <b>explosions.</b> These happen in the same years as vole outbreaks, but occur less frequently. This is partly because lemmings continue to breed {{during the winter months}} while populations of grey red-backed voles decline during the winter.|$|R
50|$|Marine phages, {{although}} microscopic {{and essentially}} unnoticed by scientists until recently, {{appear to be}} the most abundant and diverse form of DNA replicating agent on the planet. There are approximately 4x1030 phage in oceans or 5x107 per millilitre. HTVC010P infects {{one of the most common}} marine bacteria, Pelagibacter ubique of the SAR11 clade. They appear to influence biogeochemical cycles globally, provide and regulate microbial biodiversity, cycle carbon through marine food webs, and are essential in preventing bacterial <b>population</b> <b>explosions.</b> Scientists are exploring the potential of marine cyanophages to be used to prevent or reverse eutrophication.|$|R
