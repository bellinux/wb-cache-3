25|$|Chlorides, {{including}} sodium chloride, {{can promote}} the corrosion of embedded steel rebar if present in sufficiently high concentration. Chloride anions induce both localized corrosion (<b>pitting</b> <b>corrosion)</b> and generalized corrosion of steel reinforcements.

25|$|Methanol and ethanol fuels contain soluble and {{insoluble}} contaminants. Halide ions, {{which are}} soluble contaminants, such as chloride ions, {{have a large}} effect on the corrosivity of alcohol fuels. Halide ions increase corrosion in two ways: they chemically attack passivating oxide films on several metals causing <b>pitting</b> <b>corrosion,</b> and they increase the conductivity of the fuel. Increased electrical conductivity promotes electrical, galvanic and ordinary corrosion in the fuel system. Soluble contaminants such as aluminum hydroxide, itself a product of corrosion by halide ions, clogs the fuel system over time.|$|E
25|$|Graphite and {{graphite}} powder are valued in industrial applications for their self-lubricating and dry lubricating properties. There {{is a common}} belief that graphite's lubricating properties are solely due to the loose interlamellar coupling between sheets in the structure. However, {{it has been shown}} that in a vacuum environment (such as in technologies for use in space), graphite degrades as a lubricant, due to the hypoxic conditions. This observation led to the hypothesis that the lubrication is due to the presence of fluids between the layers, such as air and water, which are naturally adsorbed from the environment. This hypothesis has been refuted by studies showing that air and water are not absorbed. Recent studies suggest that an effect called superlubricity can also account for graphite's lubricating properties. The use of graphite is limited by its tendency to facilitate <b>pitting</b> <b>corrosion</b> in some stainless steel, and to promote galvanic corrosion between dissimilar metals (due to its electrical conductivity). It is also corrosive to aluminium in the presence of moisture. For this reason, the US Air Force banned its use as a lubricant in aluminium aircraft, and discouraged its use in aluminium-containing automatic weapons. Even graphite pencil marks on aluminium parts may facilitate corrosion. Another high-temperature lubricant, hexagonal boron nitride, has the same molecular structure as graphite. It is sometimes called white graphite, due to its similar properties.|$|E

30|$|Different {{from those}} on as-SLM samples, many fine <b>corrosion</b> <b>pits</b> are evenly {{distributed}} on {{the surfaces of}} casting samples (Figure  8 (e)). The size of the <b>corrosion</b> <b>pits</b> {{is just a few}} microns, and the maximum corrosion depth is only 75.51  μm (Figure  8 (f)). However, the number and the density of <b>corrosion</b> <b>pits</b> are much higher than those of as-SLM samples, resulting in a greater degree of corrosion. This kind of difference could be explained by the differences in microstructures of SLM and casting. The corrosion in as-SLM samples mainly initiates at melt track boundaries, having a feature of locality and anisotropic because of the special metallurgical process of SLM. Differently, the corrosion in casting samples mainly starts along the grain boundaries. Therefore, the <b>corrosion</b> <b>pits</b> in casting samples distribute more uniformly because of those uniform equiaxed grains.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pitting</b> <b>Corrosion</b> {{is defined}} by {{localised}} attack (microns - millimetres in diameter) in an otherwise passive surface and only occurs for specific alloy / environment combinations. Thus, this type of corrosion typically occurs in alloys that are protected by a tenacious (passivating) oxide film such as stainless steels, nickel alloys, aluminium alloys in environments that contain an aggressive species such as chlorides (Cl-). In contrast, alloy / environment combinations where the passive film is not very protective usually will not produce <b>pitting</b> <b>corrosion.</b> A {{good example of the}} importance of environment / alloy combinations is carbon steel. In environments where the pH is less than 10, carbon steel does not form a passivating oxide film and the addition of chloride results in uniform attack over the entire surface. However, at pH greater than 10 (alkaline) the oxide is very protecting and the addition of chloride results in <b>pitting</b> <b>corrosion.</b>|$|E

40|$|The fatigue {{strength}} of machines and structures operating under corrosive environment falls off remarkably {{in comparison with}} the {{fatigue strength}} in the ambient atmosphere. This decrease in fatigue strength is due to the easy initiation of fatigue cracks at <b>corrosion</b> <b>pits</b> in the early stage of the corrosion fatigue process. In order to make predictions of the lifetime of the machines and structures operating under corrosive environment, it is therefore important to understand the initiation as well as the growth characteristics of <b>corrosion</b> <b>pits.</b> However such kinds of research are few and limited, in contrast to the many studies of crack growth behavior during the corrosion fatigue process, which have been conducted.
