5|$|King Louis XV honored Franklin {{after seeing}} {{some of the}} {{electrical}} experiments done in the royal palace at St. Germain near Paris, France. However physicist Jean-Antoine Nollet (1700â€“1770), a skeptic who had published his own theory on electricity, declared Franklin's ideas were wrong. He claimed in 1753 that Franklin's lightning rod was not only dangerous but useless and would attract lightning bolts to wooden buildings, causing them to be hit more often. Franklin in time proved to the scientific community that his lightning rod invention not only was a <b>protective</b> <b>device,</b> but it {{also served as a}} preventive way to divert destructive lightning bolts away from hitting buildings.|$|E
25|$|GFCIs {{approved}} for {{protection against electric shock}} trip at 5mA within 25ms. A GFCI device which protects equipment (not people) {{is allowed to}} trip as high as 30mA of current; this is known as an Equipment <b>Protective</b> <b>Device</b> (EPD). RCDs with trip currents as high as 500 mA are sometimes deployed in environments (such as computing centers) where a lower threshold would carry an unacceptable risk of accidental trips. These high-current RCDs serve for equipment and fire protection instead of protection against the risks of electrical shocks.|$|E
25|$|The {{respiratory}} {{protective devices}} (RPD) can protect workers only if their protective properties are adequate {{to the conditions}} in the workplace. Therefore, specialists have developed criteria for the selection of proper, adequate respirators, including the Assigned Protection Factors (APF) - the decrease of the concentration of harmful substances in the inhaled air, which (is expected) to be provided with timely and proper use of a certified respirator of certain types (design) by taught and trained workers (after individual selection with a tight-fitting mask and fit testing), when the employer performs an effective respiratory <b>protective</b> <b>device</b> programme.|$|E

In this study, the phenomenology and prevalence of self-restraint in individuals showing self-injury and wearing <b>protective</b> <b>devices</b> and those showing self-injury but not wearing <b>protective</b> <b>devices</b> were compared. A high prevalence of self-restraint in the whole sample of individuals showing self-injury was identified (67 / 88, 76. 1 %), and self-restraint was more prevalent in a group showing self-injury but not wearing <b>protective</b> <b>devices</b> (43 / 47, 91. 5 %) than in a group showing self-injury and wearing <b>protective</b> <b>devices</b> (24 / 41, 58. 5 %).

2500|$|Damaged power cords of {{portable}} air conditioners cause many electrical fires and about 350 deaths per year.

The device can be integral with the power plug, or a separate module within 12 inches of the plug. An LCDI cord has a fine wire mesh around the conductors, and circuitry to detect current leaking from the conductors to the mesh, which {{would happen if the}} cord were damaged or frayed. The plugs are normal NEMA 5-15, 5-20, 6-15, 6-20 or 6-30 plugs, depending on the air conditioner, typically molded-on plugs.
