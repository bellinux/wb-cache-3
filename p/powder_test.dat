The dihedral angle a between the two connected D-A sys tems has been controlled by chemical methods; this leads to distinct changes in the optical spectra of the connected D-A chromophores, primarily changes caused by effective conjugation of the D-A system imposed by conformation constraints.

Axial and radial pressures, as well as displacement-time measurements, are made. <b>Powders</b> <b>tested</b> include: Dipac sugar; sodium chloride; potassium bromide; lactose; paracetamol d. c.; avicel; calcium phosphate; and copper sulphate. The influence of compression rate on {{the form of the}} characteristic pressure-density and radial-axial pressure relationships during uniaxial straining is presented. The investigation showed that the general tendency for all <b>powders</b> <b>tested,</b> except for paracetamol d. c., is to exhibit increased compaction pressure with strain rate up to 105 s- 1. Due to morphological and compositional effects, paracetamol d. c. softens with the rate of straining up to about 102 s- 1 and at higher rates it behaves like other powders. Also the mean radial pressure at the die wall (obtained by a pin-type transducer) shows that the friction conditions are variable during the process, and their effect tends to decrease as the speed of compaction increases, resulting in more uniform density compacts. Finally, by observing the decay of both axial and radial pressures with time under constant volume conditions, a reasonably linear behaviour is obtained for all materials tested, particularly the axial relaxation curves, over the period recorded.

In this paper, a procedure is proposed to estimate the interparticle forces beginning with the bulk flow properties as measured with standardized techniques. In particular, the relationship between interparticle forces and bulk solid tensile strength is adopted based on the microscale approaches of Rumpf (1970) and Molerus (1975). The flow properties of fluid cracking catalyst (FCC), corundum and glass bead powders were all characterized with a modified Schulze ring shear cell capable of operating at temperatures up to 500 °C.

Material and Methods: In 27 SPT patients, subgingival debridement was performed using the novel air-polishing <b>powder</b> (<b>test)</b> and hand instruments (positive control) in a randomized split mouth design. Before and immediately after treatment, subgingival plaque samples were taken from two teeth with pockets of 3 - 5 mm depth in both groups. To assess the influence of plaque sampling on the microflora, samples were also taken twice from two untreated teeth (negative control). The mean reduction in total colony forming units (CFU) was assessed by anaerobic culture. The patients' perception of treatment was assessed by a visual analog score (VAS). Therapy and plaque sampling were repeated after a 3 -month interval. Results: Test treatment resulted in a significantly greater reduction in mean CFU than positive control treatment (log 1. 7 ± 0. 98 and log 0. 61 ± 0. 79 respectively; p< 0. 05). Following both treatments, the CFU reduction was significantly greater compared to negative control treatment (log 0. 06 ± 0. 49; p< 0. 05).

40|$|The adhesional {{characteristics}} of interactive mixtures of HPMCP-coated glass spheres and several powdered drugs were investigated using {{a specially designed}} centrifuge cell. The adhesion profile of percent of drug remaining on the carrier versus {{the square of the}} speed of rotation was log normally distributed; the degree of adhesion could be characterized by the speed of rotation to detach 50 % of the particles (S 50) and the standard deviation of the distribution (σ). All the <b>powders</b> <b>tested</b> using this model interactive system possessed log normal adhesion profiles. The system was validated by testing the effect of the interactive mixture loadings and the time of centrifuging at each rotational speed on the adhesion profile. Loads between 60 and 150 mg, and centrifuging times of 30 and 60 s caused no significant change to the S 50 value obtained for a sulphapyridine interactive mixture...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effect of flow conditions (temperature, agitators and stirring speed) on particle size reduction during the reconstitution process of milk powders. Images acquired with a granulomorphometer during reconstitution showed that the mixing system design had a strong influence on {{the course of the}} rehydration process. Laser light scattering data obtained for each temperature of reconstitution and agitator revealed that whatever the <b>powder</b> <b>tested,</b> the number of agitator revolutions required to achieve a given level of rehydration was constant and independent of the stirring speed. Kinetics of rehydration were shown to be much more sensitive to temperature than to stirring speed. Inversely, as expected, it was shown that granulation did not always improve rehydration time, depending on surface composition. This result revealed that both granulation/composition and flow should be considered in controlling the reconstitution process...|$|R
