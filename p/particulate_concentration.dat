40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Over 13, 000 {{shipyard}} welders in the United States {{are subjected}} to hazardous welding fume in enclosed and confined spaces with inadequate or no ventilation. The {{purpose of this study}} was to validate a training provided to shipyard workers on the effectiveness of ventilation, particularly in the dynamic shipyard environment. Training was developed using general ventilation concepts and adapting them to the shipyard. Training concepts included moving the exhaust ventilation close to the weld's plume, creating crossdrafts, and providing mixing in the space by dilution ventilation. Testing of ventilation in dynamic work environments is difficult and rarely conducted. This study tested the training concepts in the field by monitoring for welding fume concentration before and after ventilation was introduced into the space. The worker was observed while the ventilation training parameters were added or modified in the space. A personal and area DataRAM with an SKC pump measured total particulate concentrations in the worker's breathing zone and in the work space. It was found that adding an exhaust or supply blower resulted in an average of 58 % decrease (range: 21 - 77 %) in <b>particulate</b> <b>concentration</b> in the breathing zone and a 67 % decrease (range: 39 - 86 %) of <b>particulate</b> <b>concentration</b> in the space. Providing a crossdraft at the welder's breathing zone did not consistently produce a decrease in <b>particulate</b> <b>concentration</b> and instead caused a 50 % increase in <b>particulate</b> <b>concentration</b> in the breathing zone and 5 % increase in the space. Reductions in the variability of the exposures were also seen in all adjustments except exhaust ventilation, located on the ground. Additionally, reductions in the 90 th percentiles (upwards to 90 % decrease in total particulate concentrations) were observed for all ventilation adjustments. Overall, the training concepts developed for shipyard welders do provide control and protection from welding fume in the shipyard confined spaces...|$|E

On {{the basis of}} measured size segregated, speciated <b>particulate</b> matter <b>concentrations,</b> and calculated back trajectories, three types of pollution events occurred in Beijing from 22 March to 1 April 2001 : dust storms, urban pollution events, and an industrial pollution event. For each event type, the source of each measured element is determined to be soil or anthropogenic and profiles are created that characterize the particulate matter composition. Dust storms are associated with winds traveling from desert regions and high total suspended particle (TSP) and PM 2. 5 concentrations. Sixty-two percent of TSP is due to elements with oxides and 98 % of that is from soil. Urban pollution events have smaller <b>particulate</b> <b>concentrations</b> but 49 % of the TSP is from soil, indicating that dust is {{a major component of}} the particulate matter even when there is not an active dust storm.
