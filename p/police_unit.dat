5|$|The first special <b>police</b> <b>unit</b> {{established}} in the 1990s was the Lučko Anti-Terrorist Unit (ATU). Its ranks were largely filled through the selection of police officers trained in Zagreb in 1990. A small number of other personnel were drawn from a special forces unit of the Croatian Ministry of the Interior that existed before the 1990s. Marko Lukić was the first commanding officer of the Lučko ATU.|$|E
5|$|Croatia {{established}} a company-sized special <b>police</b> <b>unit</b> in Bjelovar on 23 February 1991. Following {{the deterioration of}} the situation in western Slavonia, the 105th Brigade of the ZNG was raised in the city, largely equipped with small arms only, and plans for a blockade of the routes {{in and out of the}} city were developed. A crisis headquarters was set up to coordinate the defence of the city and the manufacture of weapons in industrial plants which had been modified for their production.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Bush's twelve-man {{military}} <b>police</b> <b>unit</b> {{arrived at}} the site from Los Alamos on December 30, 1944. This unit established initial security checkpoints and horse patrols. The distances around the site proved too great for the horses, so they resorted to using jeeps and trucks for transportation. The horses were used for playing polo. Maintenance of morale among men working long hours under harsh conditions along with dangerous reptiles and insects was a challenge. Bush strove to improve the food and accommodation, and to provide organized games and nightly movies.|$|E

5|$|Croatia {{deployed}} special police forces, {{specifically the}} Lučko, Rakitje and Sljeme special police units based {{in and around}} Zagreb, supported by additional police forces drawn from Karlovac and Gospić to retake the Plitvice Lakes area. The Croatian police force, commanded by Josip Lucić, used several buses and passenger cars, {{as well as an}} armoured personnel carrier to approach the Plitvice Lakes area. The main 180-strong group of the Rakitje Special <b>Police</b> <b>Unit</b> (SPU), directly commanded by Lucić, arrived in dense fog, along the main road from Zagreb via the Korana River bridge. The bridge was secured by the Lučko unit shortly before midnight on 30/31 March 1991. An auxiliary force approached the Plitvice Lakes via Ličko Petrovo Selo, while the Kumrovec SPU was deployed in the area between the lakes and Gospić, where it captured the Ljubovo Pass to secure the right flank of the main effort. The total attacking force comprised approximately 300 troops.|$|E

5|$|The crisis {{escalated}} into {{violence in}} late April. On 24 April, the petitioners {{and some of}} their supporters held a four-day demonstration outside the Government Palace in Dili calling for the establishment of an independent commission to address their grievances. Violence broke out on 28 April when some of the petitioners and gangs of youths who had joined the protest attacked the Government Palace. The PNTL failed to contain the protest and the Palace was badly damaged. After violence spread to other areas of Dili, Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri requested that the F-FDTL help restore order. Troops with no experience in crowd control were deployed to Dili on 29 April and three deaths resulted. On 3 May Major Alfredo Reinado, the commander of the F-FDTL's military <b>police</b> <b>unit,</b> and most of his soldiers including Lt Gastão Salsinha abandoned their posts in protest at what they saw as the army's deliberate shooting of civilians.|$|E
5|$|In early November, the JNA and the SAO Krajina TO {{intensified}} their offensive {{aimed at}} capturing Saborsko and the Slunj pocket. The main axes of the advance radiated north and northwest from the Plitvice Lakes—towards Slunj and Saborsko respectively. The JNA force {{assigned to the}} offensive was organised as the Tactical Group 2 (TG-2), {{under the command of}} Colonel Čedomir Bulat. The TG-2, whose bulk consisted of a reinforced motorised battalion detached from the 236th Motorised Brigade and a D-30 howitzer battalion, was supported by the 5th Partisan Brigade, both subordinated to the 13th JNA Corps as well as a <b>police</b> <b>unit</b> and a SAO Krajina TO brigade drawn from Plaški. The attacking force, supported by the Yugoslav Air Force, artillery and tanks, approached the village from three directions on the morning of 12 November, while the main force advancing towards Slunj reached Rakovica. According to SAO Krajina sources, the air strikes commenced at 9a.m. and lasted for fifteen minutes. They were followed by a 30-minute artillery bombardment before ground forces were ordered to attack.|$|E
5|$|While the UN was {{reluctant}} to engage with the F-FDTL, several bilateral donors have assisted the force's development. Australia has provided extensive training and logistical support to the F-FDTL since it was established, and currently provides advisors who are posted to the F-FDTL and Ministry of Defence and Security. Portugal also provides advisors and trains two naval officers each year in Portugal. China provided US$1.8million in aid to the F-FDTL between 2002 and 2008 and agreed {{to build a new}} US$7million headquarters for the force in late 2007. East Timor is one of Brazil's main destinations for aid and the Brazilian Army is responsible for training the F-FDTL's military <b>police</b> <b>unit</b> (Maubere Mission). The United States also provides a small amount of assistance to the F-FDTL through the State Department's International Military Education and Training Program. While Malaysia has provided training courses and financial and technical aid, this assistance was suspended after the 2006 crisis. Under current arrangements Portugal provides the F-FDTL with basic and advanced training while Australia and other nations provide training in specialised skills. As of 2013 the East Timorese government had posted a single member of the F-FDTL to serve overseas as an observer with the United Nations Mission in Liberia. In 2015 the government was considering joining Australia's Pacific Patrol Boat Program.|$|E
