In the wide landscape that involves the entire HE system we draw attention on the third level of its organization, i. e. the Ph. D. In particular, this paper discusses the necessity of monitoring the recruitment process of Ph. D. system because it represents a fundamental aspect of the Ph. D. system as a whole. We introduce a set of concepts related to the recruitment process and then we make them computable with synthetic indicators. The study provides an empirical analysis based on doctoral schools of four academic years at the University of Siena. Proposed indicators are finally used for detecting weakness and strength of each <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>school.</b> <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>schools,</b> <b>Ph.</b> D. s. recruitment, diversity, external attractiveness, polarization...|$|R
