5|$|Around {{the same}} time, New York Herald editor John Mullaly {{pushed for the}} {{creation}} of parks in New York City, particularly lauding the Van Cortlandt and Pell families' properties in the western and eastern Bronx respectively. He formed the New York Park Association in November 1881. Mullaly noted that New York City had less parkland per capita than many major European cities, and that the 1853 construction of Central Park had raised property values around the park immediately after construction. His association sent out pamphlets to high-profile New Yorkers, advocating for a new park. However, controversies arose over the proposals for new <b>parks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bronx, and so the city did not authorize a commission for the planned new parks. Since the city refused to make a park commission, the New York Park Association appealed to the New York State Legislature instead. On April 19, 1883, the state passed a law authorizing a seven-person commission headed by association member Luther Marsh, which would be responsible for scouting out sites for future <b>parks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 23rd and 24th wards of New York City (now the portion of the Bronx that is west of the Bronx River). Mullaly was named the secretary, In June 1883, the commission visited the park site, and by January 1884, Marsh had drafted a bill to the New York State Legislature regarding a proposed park system in the Bronx, comprising six parks connected by three parkways.|$|E
