40|$|We {{developed}} the <b>playback</b> <b>control</b> software for a high-speed playback system {{which is a}} component of the Korea-Japan Joint VLBI Correlator (KJJVC). The Mark 5 B system, which is a recorder and playback system used in the Korean VLBI Network (KVN), has two kinds of operation mode. That is to say, the station unit (SU) mode, which is for the present Mark 4 system, and the VSI mode, which is for the new VLBI standard interface (VSI) system. The software for SU is already developed and widely used in the Mark 4 type VLBI system, but the software for VSI has only been developed for recording. The new VLBI system is designed with a VSI interface for compatibility between different systems. Therefore, the <b>playback</b> <b>control</b> software development of the VSI mode is needed for KVN. In this work, we {{developed the}} <b>playback</b> <b>control</b> software of the Mark 5 B VSI mode. The developed <b>playback</b> <b>control</b> software consists of an application part for data playing back, a data input/output part for the VSI board, a module for the StreamStor RAID board, and a user interface part, including an observation time control part. To verify the performance of developed <b>playback</b> <b>control</b> software, the playback and correlation experiments were performed using the real observation data in Mark 5 B system and KJJVC. To check the observation time control, the data playback experiment was performed between the Mark 5 B and Raw VLBI Data Buffer (RVDB) systems. Through the experimental results, we confirmed the performance of developed <b>playback</b> <b>control</b> software in the Mark 5 B VSI mode...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Playback</b> <b>controls</b> (like rewind, pause, fast forward, {{changing}} volume, etc.) are all input via Touch-tones, are [...] "read" [...] by the CPU, and {{the appropriate}} actions are taken based on the stored program in the system. For example, if Fred wants to pause message playback, he might press 2. Since the CPU is constantly listening for Touch-tones from Fred, his command causes the CPU to direct the Disk Controller to stop playing the message. A variety of <b>playback</b> <b>controls</b> and options are available on most sophisticated voice-mail systems so that users can <b>control</b> message <b>playback,</b> store messages in archives, send messages to groups, change their preferences, etc.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Recent {{advances}} in multicast video streaming algorithms {{have opened up}} new ways to provision video-on-demand services to potentially millions of users. However, the spectacular efficiency of multicast streaming algorithms can only be realized by restricting or even prohibiting interactive <b>playback</b> <b>control.</b> Experiments reveal that the performance of current state-of-the-art multicast streaming algorithms will degrade significantly even at very low levels of interactivity (e. g., one control per five users). This study tackles this challenge by investigating the fundamental limitations of multicast streaming algorithms in supporting interactive <b>playback</b> <b>control</b> and presents a general solution—static full stream scheduling (SFSS) —which {{can be applied to}} many of the existing multicast streaming algorithms to substantially improve their performance when interactive <b>playback</b> <b>control</b> is to be supported. Moreover, {{to solve the problem of}} optimizing the algorithm for the often unknown client access patterns (e. g., arrival rates and interactivity rates), we present a novel just-in-time simulation (JTS) scheme to dynamically and automatically tune operating parameters of the SFSS algorithm while the system is online. This JTS scheme not only eliminates the need for a priori knowledge of the often unknown system parameters, but also can adapt to changes in the client access pattern over time. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed adaptive algorithm can reduce the admission and interactive control latencies by as much as 90 %.

For instance, the ticket allows typical modifications of the content, which are common practice in transmission, storage and presentation of video. The concept {{is part of a}} proposal currently under investigation for standardization of DVD / CPTWG copy control.

40|$|Showing a live {{software}} demonstration {{during a}} talk can be engaging, {{but it is}} often not easy: presenters may struggle with (or worry about) unexpected software crashes and encounter issues such as mismatched screen resolutions or faulty network connectivity. Furthermore, {{it can be difficult}} to recall the steps to show while talking and operating the system all at the same time. An alternative is to present with pre-recorded screencast videos. It is, however, challenging to precisely match the narration to the video when using existing video players. We introduce DemoWiz, a video presentation system that provides an increased awareness of upcoming actions through glanceable visualizations. DemoWiz supports better control of timing by overlaying visual cues and enabling lightweight editing. A user study shows that our design significantly improves the presenters’ perceived ease of narration and timing compared to a system without visualizations that was similar to a standard <b>playback</b> <b>control.</b> Furthermore, nine (out of ten) participants preferred DemoWiz over the standard <b>playback</b> <b>control</b> with the last expressing no preference...|$|E
