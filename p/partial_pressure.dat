5|$|Similar to the {{mechanism}} of ethanol's effect, the increase of gas dissolved in nerve cell membranes may cause altered ion permeability properties of the neural cells' lipid bilayers. The <b>partial</b> <b>pressure</b> of a gas required to cause a measured degree of impairment correlates well with the lipid solubility of the gas: the greater the solubility, the less <b>partial</b> <b>pressure</b> is needed.|$|E

5|$|The free oxygen <b>partial</b> <b>pressure</b> in {{the body}} of a living {{vertebrate}} organism is highest in the respiratory system, and decreases along any arterial system, peripheral tissues, and venous system, respectively. <b>Partial</b> <b>pressure</b> is the pressure that oxygen would have if it alone occupied the volume.|$|E
5|$|The partial {{pressures}} of oxygen {{and carbon dioxide}} in the arterial blood are measured by the peripheral chemoreceptors – the aortic and carotid bodies, and the central chemoreceptors of the medulla oblongata of the brainstem. The peripheral chemoreceptors are more sensitive to the arterial <b>partial</b> <b>pressure</b> of oxygen than they are to the arterial <b>partial</b> <b>pressure</b> of carbon dioxide. The central chemoreceptor is particularly sensitive to the pH of the cerebrospinal fluid, which is directly influenced by the <b>partial</b> <b>pressure</b> of {{carbon dioxide in the}} arterial blood.|$|E
5|$|Closed circuit rebreathers {{are usually}} {{controlled}} {{to provide a}} fairly constant <b>partial</b> <b>pressure</b> of oxygen during the dive (set point), and may be reset to a richer mix for decompression. The effect {{is to keep the}} <b>partial</b> <b>pressure</b> of inert gases as low as safely practicable throughout the dive. This minimizes the absorption of inert gas in the first place, and accelerates the elimination of the inert gases during ascent.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} {{breathing}} increased <b>partial</b> <b>pressures</b> of oxygen is hyperoxia, {{an excess of}} oxygen in body tissues. The body is affected in different ways {{depending on the type}} of exposure. Central nervous system toxicity is caused by short exposure to high <b>partial</b> <b>pressures</b> of oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure. Pulmonary and ocular toxicity result from longer exposure to increased oxygen levels at normal pressure. Symptoms may include disorientation, breathing problems, and vision changes such as myopia. Prolonged exposure to above-normal oxygen <b>partial</b> <b>pressures,</b> or shorter exposures to very high <b>partial</b> <b>pressures,</b> can cause oxidative damage to cell membranes, collapse of the alveoli in the lungs, retinal detachment, and seizures. Oxygen toxicity is managed by reducing the exposure to increased oxygen levels. Studies show that, in the long term, a robust recovery from most types of oxygen toxicity is possible.|$|R

Co/Fe L-edge XANES spectra indicated that the mean valence of Co ions decreased with decreasing oxygen <b>partial</b> <b>pressures,</b> while that of Fe ions was almost independent of oxygen <b>partial</b> <b>pressures.</b> This result suggested that Co ions rather than Fe ions preferentially compensated the charges caused by the formation of oxygen vacancies...|$|R

5|$|Reducing the <b>partial</b> <b>pressure</b> of the {{inert gas}} {{component}} of the breathing mixture will accelerate decompression as the concentration gradient will be greater for a given depth. This is usually achieved by increasing the <b>partial</b> <b>pressure</b> of oxygen in the breathing gas, as substituting a different inert gas may have counter-diffusion complications due to differing rates of diffusion, {{which can lead to}} a net gain in total dissolved gas tension in a tissue. This can lead to bubble formation and growth, with decompression sickness as a consequence. <b>Partial</b> <b>pressure</b> of oxygen is usually limited to 1.6 bar during in water decompression for scuba divers, but can be up to 1.9 bar in-water and 2.2 bar in the chamber when using the US Navy tables for surface decompression.|$|E
5|$|The {{arterial}} partial {{pressures of}} oxygen {{and carbon dioxide}} in the arterial blood are homeostatically controlled. A rise in the arterial <b>partial</b> <b>pressure</b> of carbon dioxide, and, to a lesser extent, a fall in the arterial <b>partial</b> <b>pressure</b> of oxygen, will reflexly cause deeper and faster breathing till the blood gas tensions return to normal. The converse happens when the carbon dioxide tension falls, or, again to a lesser extent, the oxygen tension rises: the rate and depth of breathing are reduced till blood gas normality is restored.|$|E

50|$|In {{chemistry}} and physics, Dalton's law (also called Dalton's law of <b>partial</b> <b>pressures)</b> states {{that in a}} mixture of non-reacting gases, the total pressure exerted is equal to the sum of the <b>partial</b> <b>pressures</b> of the individual gases.

40|$|During {{fiscal year}} 1998, PNNL {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} P{sub H{sub 2 }O} at or near maximum tank waste surface temperatures on the equilibrium water content of selected Hanford waste samples.

40|$|The {{methanation}} of CO 2 {{was investigated}} {{over a wide}} range of <b>partial</b> <b>pressures</b> of products and reactants using a gradientless, spinning-basket reactor operated in batch mode. The rate and selectivity of CO 2 methanation, using a 12 wt% Ni/γ–Al 2 O 3 catalyst, were explored at temperatures 453 – 483 K and pressures up to 20 bar. The rate was found to increase with increasing <b>partial</b> <b>pressures</b> of H 2 and CO 2 when the <b>partial</b> <b>pressures</b> of these reactants were low; however, the rate of reaction was found to be insensitive to changes in the <b>partial</b> <b>pressures</b> of H 2 and CO 2 when their <b>partial</b> <b>pressures</b> were high. A convenient method of determining the effect of H 2 O on the rate of reaction was also developed using the batch reactor and the inhibitory effect of H 2 O on CO 2 methanation was quantified. The kinetic measurements were compared with a mathematical model of the reactor, in which different kinetic expressions were explored. The kinetics of the reaction were found to be consistent with a mechanism in which adsorbed CO 2 dissociated to adsorbed CO and O {{on the surface of the}} catalyst with the rate-limiting step being the subsequent dissociation of adsorbed CO...|$|R

40|$|Ocean {{acidification}} {{in response}} to rising atmospheric CO 2 <b>partial</b> <b>pressures</b> is widely expected to reduce calcification by marine organisms.
