Association of ev genes with <b>production</b> <b>trait</b> differences was studied in White Leghorns free of exogenous ALV. The Cornell Strain K and S chickens used in Experiment 1 had multiple ev genes. In each of four lines of chickens in Experiment 2, there was a 1 : 1 segregation of full-sibs free of ev genes and those carrying one ev gene: ev- 12 mat produces the complete endogenous virus, ev- 3 or ev- 6 that express certain viral antigens, or ev- 1, a silent gene. In Experiment 1, the presence of genes ev- 10 or ev- 19, known to produce the complete virus, was associated with a 9 % reduction in the annual egg production rate (P< 05) in Strain S. Similarly, the presence of the virus-producing ev- 12 in Experiment 2 was associated with an 8 % reduction of annual egg production rate (P< 05), a 2. 2 -g reduction in egg weight (P< 01), and a. 003 reduction in egg specific gravity (P< 01). No significant effects of ev genes on age at first egg, Haugh unit score, percentage of eggs with blood spots, and body weight of hens were observed.

In selection process of candidate tress, genetic diversity plays very important role because higher genetic diversity will give higher opportunity to get source of genes for improved trait. Selection activities of high resin yielder candidates were started in 2006 through a series of survey activity and morphological identification of candidate trees with high resin production. Specific information about traits genetically related to resin production in Cijambu Seedling Seed Orchard is still not determined yet, although based on resin distribution trend this SSO has the highest mean of resin production. In this study, progenies planted in 1978 - 1983 were evaluated to determine the effectiveness of previous selection, as well as the value of heritability and phenotypic traits that allegedly related with resin production. The results showed high value of coefficient genetic variation (CVG: 16. 08 %), narrow sense heritability values for resin <b>production</b> <b>trait</b> (0. 65) and resemble with previous research. This indicates that genetic factor was dominant for resin production and selection activities has been done for 30 years was effective to get high yielder superior candidate.

40|$|Mainly for {{historical}} reasons, genetic evaluation for pigs {{is carried out}} separately for <b>production</b> and reproduction <b>traits</b> in most pig breeding as-sociations.

40|$|Age at puberty is an {{important}} <b>production</b> <b>trait</b> in beef cattle where heifers are bred to calve at 2 years of age, especially when a restricted breeding season is used.

Several researchers have demonstrated large differences among breed or breed cross in age at puberty of heifers. Other researchers have demonstrated that undernutrition may result in increased age at puberty, subnormal conception rate, and underdeveloped udders. Overfeeding, however,may result in weak heat symptoms, subnormal conception rate, high embryonic mortality, decreased mammary gland development, and decreased milk production.

5000|$|Under current practice, normal parent poultry {{breeding}} stock potentially face welfare problems.

This severe feed restriction has negative effects on bird welfare as it causes chronic stress resulting from hunger. The use of normal fast growing broiler breeder hens require dedicated programmes of feed restriction, both to maximise egg and chick production and secondly to avoid metabolic disorders and mortality in broiler breeders.

40|$|Despite its importance, {{fertility}} {{has been}} declining in many cattle populations. In dairy cattle, this decline is often attributed to the negative correlation between fertility and <b>productions</b> <b>traits.</b> Recent studies showed that embryonic lethal variants might also account for a non-negligible fraction of the fertility decline. Therefore identification of such embryonic lethal variants is essential to improve fertility. We herein illustrate, with {{an example of a}} large recessive lethal deletion recently identified in Nordic Red cattle, that haplotype-based method are particularly efficient to identify such embryonic lethal variants. We first show that haplotypes can be used in traditional QTL mapping approaches and that they present very high linkage disequilibrium with underlying variants. Haplotypes can also be used in scan for lack of homozygosity. Indeed,if a haplotype is associated to a recessive lethal variant, significantly fewer living individuals will be homozygote for that haplotype than expected. For both approaches, haplotype- based methods were particularly efficient. The lack of homozygosity approach achieved higher significance than the QTL approach. Only frequent variants can be detected with both approaches unless huge genotyped cohorts are available.
