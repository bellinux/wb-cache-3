40|$|A robust {{cellular}} counter {{could enable}} synthetic biologists to design complex circuits with diverse behaviors. The existing synthetic-biological counters, {{responsive to the}} beginning of the pulse, are sensitive to the pulse duration. Here we present a pulse detecting circuit that responds only at the falling edge of a pulse-analogous to negative edge triggered electric circuits. As biological events do not follow precise timing, use of such a <b>pulse</b> <b>detector</b> would enable the design of robust asynchronous counters which can count the completion of events. This transcription-based pulse detecting circuit depends on the interaction of two co-expressed lambdoid phage-derived proteins: the first is unstable and inhibits the regulatory activity of the second, stable protein. At the end of the pulse the unstable inhibitor protein disappears from the cell and the second protein triggers the recording of the event completion. Using stochastic simulation we showed that the proposed design can detect the completion of the pulse irrespective to the pulse duration. In our simulation we also showed that fusing the <b>pulse</b> <b>detector</b> with a phage lambda memory element we can construct a counter which can be extended to count larger numbers.

40|$|Using Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) for {{the purpose}} of {{fluorescence}} lifetime measurements is usually limited in speed due to pile-up.

40|$|Gas gain {{measurements}} {{were made for}} nitrogen, xenon and x non with 2, 3 dimethyl- 2 -butene (DMB) as an additive. Two different methods of measuring gas gain were examined, pulse matching methods and current comparison methods. A preliminary investigation {{was made into a}} new approach to the pulse matching method. Previous authors had shaped their test pulses to the same shape as their <b>detector</b> <b>pulses</b> or used a calibration factor to correct for the difference between the shape of the test <b>pulses</b> and the <b>detector</b> <b>pulses.</b> These approaches would be valid only if the <b>detector</b> <b>pulses</b> were always the same shape. The <b>pulses</b> from the <b>detector</b> vary in shape depending upon where the primary ion pairs are formed in the detector sensitive volume. The new approach' I have investigated shapes the <b>detector</b> <b>pulses</b> and the test pulses to the same shape so that the variation in the <b>detector</b> <b>pulse</b> shape becomes irrelevant. This method of measuring gas gain was tested using P- 10 and 148 Gd as an alpha particle source and gave similar results to gas gains determined by current comparisons. The measurements of gas gain finally used to obtain the data were all performed using the current comparison technique. When the electrons were collected at the central wire and 55 Fe was used as the radiation source the ion saturation curves for xenon showed no definite plateaus, only points of inflexion. I found that ion saturation currents could be determined by fitting the observed currents and associated operating voltages to an expression proposed by Johnson. This expression also enabled me to determine the voltage region where gas gain began. The gas gain characteristics of nitrogen and xenon were measured for a range of gas densities. From these measurements it was shown that the gas gain of a cylindrical proportional counter operating in the proportional region is a function only of the reduced field strength at the surface of the anode. Aoyama has proposed an expression for the first Townsend coefficient and {{he has been able to}} show that previously proposed expressions are only special cases of his expression. I was able to obtain an excellent fit to Aoyama's expression using my gas gain data for xenon and a value for one of the parameters determined by Kowalski. It is widely held that the mechanism of gas gain in proportional counters is primarily by electron impact. Ionization may also occur in binary mixtures by the non-metastable Penning effect, and the metastable Penning effect. A binary mixture of xenon and DMB was used to investigate these effects. It was found that the gas gain in xenon could be greatly increased by the addition of a small quantity of DMB.
