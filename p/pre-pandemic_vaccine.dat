50|$|Scientific {{advances}} may attenuate probable lethality. The genetic lethality {{potential of}} the initial flu pandemic strain is only one important factor in determining the ultimate outcome in number of human lives lost. Another factor that grows potentially more important {{with the passage of}} time is human preparation. For example, no influenza vaccine specific to H5N1 could be produced when it emerged in Hong Kong in 1997, because it was lethal to eggs. Reverse DNA techniques have since made a vaccine possible, and several H5N1 vaccines have been tested and are in production in at least limited quantities. Vaccine development and production facilities are being ramped up, and possible pre-pandemic vaccines are being produced and studied. If a human pandemic does not emerge in the next few years, its eventual emergence may become almost a non-event if a very-effective <b>pre-pandemic</b> <b>vaccine</b> has prepared the population with sufficient herd immunity to blunt its lethality. Indeed, if there is sufficient immunity to stop it at the source, it will not become pandemic.|$|E

40|$|Human {{infection}} with the highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus H 5 N 1 {{is associated with}} a high mortality and morbidity. H 5 N 1 continues to transmit from poultry to the human population, raising serious concerns about its pandemic potential. Current influenza H 5 N 1 vaccines are based upon the elicitation of a neutralizing antibody (Ab) response against the major epitope regions of the viral surface glycoprotein, hemagglutinin (HA). However, antigenic drift mutations in immune-dominant regions on the HA structure allow the virus to escape Ab neutralization.

40|$|Background: The recent {{spread of}} avian {{influenza}} in wild birds and poultry {{may be a}} precursor {{to the emergence of}} a 1918 -like human pandemic. Therefore, stockpiles of human <b>pre-pandemic</b> <b>vaccine</b> (targeted at avian strains) are being considered. For many countries, the principal constraint for these vaccine stockpiles will be the total mass of antigen maintained. We tested the hypothesis that lower individual doses (i. e., less than the recommended dose for maximum protection) may provide substantial extra community-level benefits because they would permit wider vaccine coverage for a given total size of antigen stockpile. Methods and Findings: We used a mathematical model to predict infection attack rates under different policies. The model incorporated both an individual's response to vaccination at different doses and the process of person-to-person transmission of pandemic influenza. We found that substantial reductions in the attack rate are likely if vaccines are given to more people at lower doses. These results are applicable to all three vaccine candidates for which data are available. As a guide to the magnitude of the effect, we simulated epidemics based on historical studies of immunogenicity. For example, for one of the vaccines for which data are available, the attack rate would drop from 67. 6 % to 58. 7 % if 160 out of the total US population of 300 million were given an optimal dose rather than 20 out of 300 million given the maximally protective dose (as promulgated in the US National Pandemic Preparedness Plan). Our results are conservative with respect to a number of alternative assumptions about the precise nature of vaccine protection. We also considered a model variant that includes a single high-risk subgroup representing children. For smaller stockpile sizes that allow vaccine to be offered only to the high-risk group at the optimal dose, the predicted benefits of using the homogenous model formed a lower bound {{in the presence of a}} risk group, even when the high-risk group was twice as infective and twice as susceptible. Conclusions: In addition to individual-level protection (i. e., vaccine efficacy), the population-level implications of <b>pre-pandemic</b> <b>vaccine</b> programs should be considered when deciding on stockpile size and dose. Our results suggest that a lower vaccine dose may be justified in order to increase population coverage, thereby reducing the infection attack rate overall. © 2007 Riley et al. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{important}} {{lessons learned from the}} 2009 H 1 N 1 pandemic is that a high yield in-fluenza vaccine virus is essential for efficient and timely production of pandemic vaccines in eggs. The current seasonal and <b>pre-pandemic</b> <b>vaccine</b> viruses are generated either by clas-sical reassortment or reverse genetics. Both approaches utilize a high growth virus, gener-ally A/Puerto Rico/ 8 / 1934 (PR 8), as the donor of all or most of the internal genes, and the wild type virus recommended for inclusion in the vaccine to contribute the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes encoding the surface glycoproteins. As a result of ex-tensive adaptation through sequential egg passaging, PR 8 viruses with different gene se-quences and high growth properties have been selected at different laboratories in past decades. The effect of these related but distinct internal PR 8 genes on the growth of vac-cine viruses in eggs has not been examined previously. Here, we use reverse genetics to analyze systematically the growth and HA antigen yield of reassortant viruses with 3 differ-ent PR 8 backbones.

40|$|The {{threat posed}} by {{influenza}} pandemics raises serious ethical issues, as well as questions of global health governance. In order to create <b>pre-pandemic</b> <b>vaccines,</b> global health authorities need access to virus from regional outbreaks. But because the countries where these outbreaks occur are unlikely {{to benefit from the}} vaccine, they are sometimes reluctant to share this seed stock, and may try to make proprietary arrangements with pharmaceutical companies, as briefly occurred in Indonesia. Although these arrangements may increase developing countries 2 ̆ 7 access to vaccine, they hamper the global cooperation necessary to prepare for influenza outbreaks. Developing countries, in contrast, point to the United States 2 ̆ 7 decision not to use adjuvants in influenza vaccines with the 2009 H 1 N 1 outbreak, even though this is common in Europe, and it might make tens of millions of individual doses available for donation to developing countries. Similar issues bedevil preparation efforts, particularly concerning advance contracts for vaccines.

40|$|Mitigation of {{a severe}} {{influenza}} pandemic {{can be achieved}} using a range of interventions to reduce transmission. Interventions can reduce the impact of an outbreak and buy time until vaccines are developed, but they may have high social and economic costs. The non-linear effect on the epidemic dynamics means that suitable strategies crucially depend on the precise aim of the intervention. National pandemic influenza plans rarely contain clear statements of policy objectives or prioritization of potentially conflicting aims, such as minimizing mortality (depending on the severity of a pandemic) or peak prevalence or limiting the socio-economic burden of contact-reducing interventions. We use epidemiological models of influenza A to investigate how contact-reducing interventions and availability of antiviral drugs or <b>pre-pandemic</b> <b>vaccines</b> contribute to achieving particular policy objectives. Our analyses show that the ideal strategy depends on the aim of an intervention and that the achievement of one policy objective may preclude success with others, e. g., constraining peak demand for public health resources may lengthen {{the duration of the}} epidemic and hence its economic and social impact. Constraining total case numbers can be achieved by a range of strategies, whereas strategies which additionally constrain peak demand for services require a more sophisticated intervention. If, for example, there are multiple objectives which must be achieved prior to the availability of a pandemic vaccine (i. e., a time-limited intervention), our analysis shows that interventions should be implemented several weeks into the epidemic, not at the very start.

40|$|There is a {{constant}} threat of zoonotic influenza viruses causing a pandemic outbreak in humans. It {{is virtually impossible to}} predict which virus strain will cause the next pandemic and it takes a considerable amount of time before a safe and effective vaccine will be available once a pandemic occurs. In addition, development of pandemic vaccines is hampered by the generally poor immunogenicity of avian influenza viruses in humans. An effective <b>pre-pandemic</b> <b>vaccine</b> is therefore required as a first line of defense. Broadening of the protective efficacy of current seasonal vaccines by adding an adjuvant may be a way to provide such first line of defense.

40|$|The {{impact of}} the next {{influenza}} pandemic may be mitigated by inducing immunity in individuals {{prior to the start}} of national epidemics using a <b>pre-pandemic</b> <b>vaccine</b> targeted against current avian influenza strains. The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) intends that pre-pandemic vaccines will be allocated to states in proportion to the size of their population in predefined priority groups, i. e. approximately pro-rata. We show that such an equitable policy is likely to be the least efficient in terms of the number of infections averted. We demonstrate that the potential benefits could be substantial if a fully discretionary policy is allowed, i. e. if some regions are allocated sufficient vaccines to achieve herd immunity while other regions are allocated no vaccine. Since such an inequitable policy may be impractical, we consider the sensitivity of an intermediate policy (in which 50 % of the stockpile is allocated on a pro-rata basis) to key transmission uncertainties. The benefits of the 50 % discretionary policy are sensitive to parameter values which cannot be known in advance. Therefore, despite substantial potential benefits of non-pro-rata policies, our results suggest that the current HHS policy of pro-rata allocation by state is a good compromise in terms of simplicity, robustness, equity and efficiency. © 2007 The Royal Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of H 5, H 7, and H 9 avian influenza virus subtypes in humans reveals their pandemic potential. Although human-to-human transmission has been limited, the genetic reassortment of the avian and human/porcine influenza viruses or mutations {{in some of}} the genes resulting in virus replication in the upper respiratory tract of humans could generate novel pandemic influenza viruses. Current vaccines do not provide cross protection against antigenically distinct strains of the H 5, H 7, and H 9 influenza viruses. Therefore, newer vaccine approaches are needed to overcome these potential threats. We developed an egg-independent, adenovirus vector-based, multi-epitope (ME) vaccine approach using the relatively conserved immunogenic domains of the H 5 N 1 influenza virus [M 2 ectodomain (M 2 e), hemagglutinin (HA) fusion domain (HFD), T-cell epitope of nucleoprotein (TNP). and HA α-helix domain (HαD) ]. Our ME vaccine induced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and caused a significant reduction in the viral loads in the lungs of vaccinated mice that were challenged with antigenically distinct H 5, H 7, or H 9 avian influenza viruses. These results suggest that our ME vaccine approach provided broad protection against the avian influenza viruses. Further improvement of this vaccine will lead to a <b>pre-pandemic</b> <b>vaccine</b> that may lower morbidity, hinder transmission, and prevent mortality in a pandemic situation before a strain-matched vaccine becomes available...|$|E

Safety was monitored until 6 months after booster. Immunogenicity was assessed by hemagglutination inhibition (HI), single radial hemolysis (SRH) and microneutralization assays (MN). Mild injection-site pain was the most common adverse reaction. No serious adverse events relating to the vaccine were reported. The humoral immune responses to 7. 5 microg and 15 microg doses were comparable. The rates for seroprotection (HI> 40; SRH> 25 mm(2); MN > or = 40) after the primary vaccination ranged 72 - 87 %. Six months after primary vaccination with the 7. 5 microg dose, 18 % and 21 % of non-elderly and elderly adults were seroprotected; rates increased to 90 % and 84 %, respectively, after the booster vaccination.

Here we report {{the results of the}} yearly licensing studies of the past 11 influenza seasons (1997 - 2007) with a trivalent, inactivated whole virus vaccine with an aluminum phosphate adjuvant system. METHODS: Sixty healthy volunteers per age group (18 - 60 years and 60 years and older) were enrolled to receive vaccination each year, thus, a total of 1080 subjects were studied. Serum antibody titers were measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI). RESULTS: The vaccine met the criteria for licensing each year, meaning seroprotection (achievement of an HI titer of > 1 : 40 in > 70 % of subjects); seroconversion, i. e. a > 4 -fold increase in HI antibody titer, or reaching a titer of > 1 : 40, in > 40 % of subjects; and an increase in geometric mean titers by > 2. 5 -fold.

Sixty adults were recruited into a randomized clinical trial and were intramuscularly immunized with two virosomal vaccine H 5 N 1 (NIBRG- 14) doses (21 days apart) of 30 μg HA alone or 1. 5, 7. 5 or 30 μg HA adjuvanted with Matrix M. The kinetics and longevity of the serological responses against NIBRG- 14 were determined by haemagglutination inhibition (HI), single radial haemolysis (SRH), microneutralization (MN) and ELISA assays. The cross-H 5 clade responses in sera were determined by HI and the antibody-secreting (ASC) cell ELISPOT assays. The protective efficacy of the vaccine against homologous HPAI challenge was evaluated in ferrets. Results: The serological responses against the homologous and cross-reactive strains generally peaked one week after the second dose, and formulation with Matrix M augmented the responses. The NIBRG- 14 -specific seroprotection rates fell significantly by six months and were low against cross-reactive strains although the adjuvant appeared to prolong the longevity of the protective responses in some subjects. By 12 months post-vaccination, nearly all vaccinees had NIBRG- 14 -specific antibody titres below the protective thresholds. The Matrix M adjuvant was shown to greatly improve ASC and serum IgG responses following vaccination. In a HPAI ferret challenge model, the vaccine protected the animals from febrile responses, severe weight loss and local and systemic spread of the virus.

40|$|The {{induction}} of neutralising {{antibodies to}} the viral surface glycoprotein, haemagglutinin (HA) {{is considered the}} cornerstone of current seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines. Mapping of neutralising epitopes using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) helps define mechanisms of antigenic drift, neutralising escape and facilitates <b>pre-pandemic</b> <b>vaccine</b> design. In the present study we reverse engineered the antigenic structure of the HAs of two highly pathogenic H 5 N 1 vaccine strains representative of currently circulating clade 1 and 2. 2 H 5 N 1 viruses. The HA sequence of the A/Vietnam/ 1194 / 04 clade 1 virus was progressively mutated into the HA sequence of the clade 2. 2 virus, A/Bar-headed Goose/Qinghai/ 1 A/ 05. Fine mapping of clade-specific neutralising epitopes was performed by examining the cross-reactivity of mAbs raised against the native HA of each parent virus. The reactivity across all clade specific mAbs centred around a constellation of mutations at positions 140, 145, 171 and 172, {{all of which are}} proximal to the receptor binding site on the membrane distal globular head of the HA. Overlapping cross-reactivity of these antigenic sites suggests that these amino acid positions relate to the antigenic evolution of the H 5 clade 1 and 2. 2 viruses. This finding may prove useful for the design of vaccines with broader neutralising cross-reactivity against the different H 5 HA sublineages currently in circulation. These findings provide important information about the amino acid changes involved in the cross-clade evolution of H 5 N 1 viruses and their potential for human to human transmission; and facilitates a greater understanding of the pandemic potential of H 5 N 1 isolates...|$|E

The presence of inulin or trehalose sugar excipients during freeze-drying of the vaccine proved to be critical to maintain its immunogenic potency during storage, and to preserve the characteristic Th 1 -type response to whole inactivated virus vaccine. These results indicate that whole inactivated virus vaccines may be stored and handled at room temperature in moderate climate zones {{for over a year}} with minimal decline and, if converted to dry-powder, even in hot climate zones for at least 3  months. The increased stability of dry-powder vaccine at 40 °C may also point to an extended shelf-life when stored at 4 °C.

We, therefore, investigated the effect of elevated storage temperatures on the immunogenicity of a pre-pandemic influenza A H 5 N 1 whole inactivated virus vaccine. Either suspended in liquid or kept as a freeze-dried powder, vaccines could be stored for 1 year at ambient temperature (20 °C) with minimal loss of immunogenicity in mice. Elevation of the storage temperature to 40 °C, however, resulted in a significant loss of immunogenic potency within 3 months if vaccines were stored in liquid suspension. In sharp contrast, freeze-dried powder formulations were stable at 40 °C for at least 3 months. The presence of inulin or trehalose sugar excipients during freeze-drying of the vaccine proved to be critical to maintain its immunogenic potency during storage, and to preserve the characteristic Th 1 -type response to whole inactivated virus vaccine. These results indicate that whole inactivated virus vaccines may be stored and handled at room temperature in moderate climate zones {{for over a year}} with minimal decline and, if converted to dry-powder, even in hot climate zones for at least 3 months. The increased stability of dry-powder vaccine at 40 °C may also point to an extended shelf-life when stored at 4 °C. Use of the more stable dry-powder formulation could simplify stockpiling and thereby facilitating successful pandemic intervention.

40|$|Antigenic {{variation}} among circulating H 5 N 1 highly pathogenic {{avian influenza}} A viruses mandates the continuous production of strain-specific <b>pre-pandemic</b> <b>vaccine</b> candidates and represents a significant challenge for pandemic preparedness. Here we assessed the structural, antigenic and receptor-binding properties of three H 5 N 1 HPAI virus hemagglutinins, which were recently {{selected by the}} WHO as vaccine candidates [A/Egypt/N 03072 / 2010 (Egypt 10, clade 2. 2. 1), A/Hubei/ 1 / 2010 (Hubei 10, clade 2. 3. 2. 1) and A/Anhui/ 1 / 2005 (Anhui 05, clade 2. 3. 4) ]. These analyses revealed that antigenic diversity among these three isolates was restricted {{to changes in the}} size and charge of amino acid side chains at a handful of positions, spatially equivalent to the antigenic sites identified in H 1 subtype viruses circulating among humans. All three of the H 5 N 1 viruses analyzed in this study were responsible for fatal human infections, with the most recently-isolated strains, Hubei 10 and Egypt 10, containing multiple residues in the receptor-binding site of the HA, which were suspected to enhance mammalian transmission. However, glycan-binding analyses demonstrated a lack of binding to human 12 - 6 -linked sialic acid receptor analogs for all three HAs, reinforcing the notion that receptor-binding specificity contributes only partially to transmissibility and pathogenesis of HPAI viruses and suggesting that changes in host specificity must be interpreted {{in the context of the}} host and environmental factors, as well as the virus as a whole. Together, our data reveal structural linkages with phylogenetic and antigenic analyses of recently emerged H 5 N 1 virus clades and should assist in interpreting the significance of future changes in antigenic and receptor-binding properties.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The US {{government}} proposes {{pandemic influenza}} mitigation guidance that includes isolation and antiviral treatment of ill persons, voluntary household member quarantine and antiviral prophylaxis, social distancing of individuals, school closure, reduction of contacts at work, and prioritized vaccination. Is this {{the best strategy}} combination? Is choice of this strategy robust to pandemic uncertainties? What are critical enablers of community resilience? METHODS AND FINDINGS: We systematically simulate {{a broad range of}} pandemic scenarios and mitigation strategies using a networked, agent-based model of a community of explicit, multiply-overlapping social contact networks. We evaluate illness and societal burden for alterations in social networks, illness parameters, or intervention implementation. For a 1918 -like pandemic, the best strategy minimizes illness to < 1 % of the population and combines network-based (e. g. school closure, social distancing of all with adults' contacts at work reduced), and case-based measures (e. g. antiviral treatment of the ill and prophylaxis of household members). We find choice of this best strategy robust to removal of enhanced transmission by the young, additional complexity in contact networks, and altered influenza natural history including extended viral shedding. Administration of age-group or randomly targeted 50 % effective <b>pre-pandemic</b> <b>vaccine</b> with 7 % population coverage (current US H 5 N 1 vaccine stockpile) had minimal effect on outcomes. In order, mitigation success depends on rapid strategy implementation, high compliance, regional mitigation, and rigorous rescinding criteria; these are the critical enablers for community resilience. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic evaluation of feasible, recommended pandemic influenza interventions generally confirms the US community mitigation guidance yields best strategy choices for pandemic planning that are robust {{to a wide range of}} uncertainty. The best strategy combines network- and case-based interventions; network-based interventions are paramount. Because strategies must be applied rapidly, regionally, and stringently for greatest benefit, preparation and public education is required for long-lasting, high community compliance during a pandemic...|$|E
40|$|Objectives To {{estimate}} the potential {{economic impact of}} pandemic influenza, associated behavioural responses, school closures, and vaccination on the United Kingdom. Design A computable general equilibrium model of the UK economy was specified for various combinations of mortality and morbidity from pandemic influenza, vaccine efficacy, school closures, and prophylactic absenteeism using published data. Setting The 2004 UK economy (the most up to date available with suitable economic data). Main outcome measures The economic impact of various scenarios with different pandemic severity, vaccination, school closure, and prophylactic absenteeism specified in terms {{of gross domestic product}}, output from different economic sectors, and equivalent variation. Results The costs related to illness alone ranged between 0. 5 % and 1. 0 % of gross domestic product (£ 8. 4 bn to £ 16. 8 bn) for low fatality scenarios, 3. 3 % and 4. 3 % (£ 55. 5 bn to £ 72. 3 bn) for high fatality scenarios, and larger still for an extreme pandemic. School closure increases the economic impact, particularly for mild pandemics. If widespread behavioural change takes place and there is large scale prophylactic absence from work, the economic impact would be notably increased with few health benefits. Vaccination with a <b>pre-pandemic</b> <b>vaccine</b> could save 0. 13 % to 2. 3 % of gross domestic product (£ 2. 2 bn to £ 38. 6 bn); a single dose of a matched vaccine could save 0. 3 % to 4. 3 % (£ 5. 0 bn to £ 72. 3 bn); and two doses of a matched vaccine could limit the overall economic impact to about 1 % of gross domestic product for all disease scenarios. Conclusion Balancing school closure against "business as usual" and obtaining sufficient stocks of effective vaccine are more important factors in determining the economic impact of an influenza pandemic than is the disease itself. Prophylactic absence from work in response to fear of infection can add considerably to the economic impact...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{influenza}} virus on populations is often under-estimated, {{a thorough understanding}} of its epidemiology remains elusive and common methods of measuring influenza lack validation. To determine limitations of data sources used for epidemiological study of influenza, record linkage was used to combine person-level information from emergency department, hospital admission, death and laboratory-notified influenza databases, from New South Wales (NSW), Australia. In each of the hospital and death databases, a minority of patients with a virologically confirmed influenza infection were recorded as having influenza as a cause of their illness. Among database records with influenza recorded as a cause of the illness, a minority were based on laboratory diagnosis. The emergence of pandemic influenza in 2009 caused by the influenza A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09 virus provided an opportunity to attempt more complete estimates of the outcomes of influenza infection. Questions on influenza-like illness (ILI) were introduced into the continuous NSW Health Survey to provide population representative estimates of influenza-like illness. During July to September 2009, 23 % of the NSW population reported an ILI, of which 55 % sought general practice care and 5 % presented to a hospital. Smoking and obesity were risk factors for reporting ILI, and the effectiveness of the <b>pre-pandemic</b> seasonal <b>vaccine</b> against ILI was ~ 20 %. Time series analysis was used to estimate mortality attributable to the pandemic virus and seasonal influenza epidemics in preceding years, for NSW and Australia. Using age-specific weekly counts of all-cause death registrations revealed that overall mortality in NSW was lower than seasonally expected during the cooler months of 2009 in which the pandemic virus circulated. Consistent with earlier pandemics, reduced mortality appeared largely driven by the relative immunity of older persons to the pandemic virus. The national study used cause-specific death and laboratory reported influenza virus time series and a novel statistical method. All-cause, all-age mortality reached levels as high as 12. 0 per 100, 000 when influenza A(H 3 N 2) predominated, while 2009 pandemic mortality was 2. 5 per 100, 000 (not statistically significant), and influenza B mortality was negligible. Ongoing application of these methods can provide improved and consistent comparisons of the impact of influenza on populations over time...|$|R
40|$|Highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} A (HPAI) H 5 N 1 viruses have circulated continuously, posing a great threat to {{human and animal}} health for close to two decades. One major perspective to prevent a potential H 5 N 1 pandemic is to stockpile vaccine candidates. The cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CD 8 + T-cell) tends to target more conserved influenza virus proteins. However, no systematic analysis of conserved CD 8 + T-cell-reactive epitopes across all H 5 N 1 clades has been conducted. Therefore, this study was undertaken to identify and map conserved epitopes across the hypothesized phylogenetic tree and to correlate these observations with the geographic distribution of predicted human CD 8 + reactive epitopes. ^ Conserved epitopes were predicted from twenty-seven WHO-endorsed vaccine candidates and twenty-eight clade-defining strains. Comparative genetic analyses and epitope conservancy analyses were conducted in a representative dataset consisting of 951 H 5 N 1 Hemagluttinin (HA) sequences collected from infected birds and humans between 1996 and 2013. Epitope distributions were mapped to form “fingerprint” patterns for each HPAI H 5 N 1 clade or for each geographic location of currently circulating H 5 N 1 strains, respectively. Vaccine coverage was calculated to evaluate whether the vaccine candidates can effectively predict the conserved epitopes among H 5 N 1 clades or among currently circulating strains. Population coverage of HLA-A* 02 : 01 which binds to viral epitopes to stimulate human immune response, was queried in different geographic or ethnic populations. ^ Forty-nine possible conserved CD 8 + T-cell-reactive epitopes along 28 different amino acid positions of the HA surface protein were predicted. Although many H 5 N 1 clades have emerged over time, reconstruction of the viruses’ history suggested that only four clades (clades 1, 2. 1 - 2. 3) have continued to persist and circulate in birds and human populations since 2012. Epitope “fingerprint” patterns representative of each H 5 N 1 lineage or of each geographic location for currently circulating strains, provided a rapid evaluation {{of the effectiveness of}} vaccine candidates. The highly conserved epitopes in certain positions proposed a new perspective to develop a universal epitope-based vaccine candidate for HPAI H 5 N 1. The vaccine coverage analyses showed high coverage in all H 5 N 1 isolates at certain epitope positions, however, the positions with lower coverage may explain why the vaccine candidates do not always function well. The similar pattern was found in the currently circulating strains, but the mean overall coverage of each vaccine candidates and the time of most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) between the currently circulating strains and their closest vaccine candidates suggested that both the prediction of conserved epitopes and the surveillance of H 5 N 1 genetic characteristics are important {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} vaccine strains. Population coverage of HLA-A* 02 : 01 varied in different populations, and was inversely correlated with the percentage of H 5 N 1 isolates among geographic locations. ^ These findings emphasized the importance of pre-existing immune protection can affect the extent or scale of H 5 N 1 pandemic in different populations. The usage of conserved epitopes for HPAI H 5 N 1 universal vaccine development is to determine the best combination of conserved epitopes among different H 5 N 1 genes that maximize the human population coverage of HLA groups. Taken together, our results suggest combining molecular epidemiology of HPAI H 5 N 1 with HLA paratope protective coverage mapping may be valuable to <b>pre-pandemic</b> planning and <b>vaccine</b> design. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{high risk}} for a {{possible}} future avian influenza pandemic is alarming the entire scientific world. There are two main reasons: first of all, in the last decades is emerged the great ability of avian influenza virus (AIV) to infect both domestic and wild birds, with the possibility to spread the infection around the world thanks their migratory flights; then, {{the growing number of}} AIV strains isolated in the last years, proving the genomic mutation skills of the virus, leading to the high risk to become capable to infect humans, generating a possible influenza pandemic. In the present work two different studies has been performed in parallel with the aim to evaluate the immunogenicity of a new Vero-cell derived A/H 5 N 1 /Indonesia/ 05 / 2005, <b>pre-pandemic</b> influenza <b>vaccine,</b> in a healthy adult population after intramuscolar (IM) and intradermal injection (ID). In both cases, the serum of every patient was evaluate at three time points: V 1, before vaccination, V 2, after 21 days (for intramuscolar vaccine) and 28 days (for intradermal vaccine) from the first vaccination and then, V 3, after 43 days from the first immunization. After V 2, the population received a second dose of vaccine. The intramuscolare vaccine has been evaluated through 5 different HA concentration per dose (5 - 10 - 15 - 30 - 60 µg/dose); the population composed by 180 healthy adults, has been divided into 5 different cohorts. In order to evaluate the immunogenicity of the intradermal vaccine, the population was composed by 60 healthy adults, vaccinated with 15 µg of HA/dose. While in the first study, for each cohort was evaluated the intensity of the immune response through three different serological assays (SRH, HI and MN), in the second one, the evaluation was performed through the SRH and HI assays; the only two methods recognised and recommed by EMA to evaluate the immunogenicity and efficacy of a new influenza vaccine The vaccines evaluated in the present study brings an important innovation derived by the use of Vero cells platform for the production of the virus, to replace the classical method based on embryonated hen eggs. Infact, in case of influenza pandemic, the use of eggs could have some disadavantages: the current method of viral production requires at least of 6 - 9 months and, in addition, the high patogenic avian influenza virus can’t be propagated efficiently in embryonated hen eggs, because they kill the embryones very quickly. For the IM vaccine, correlations between the three serological assays were performed in order to evaluate the difference in antibodies detection for each assay. This IM vaccine has been administered in 5 different HA/dose concentrations. From the results it is possible to state that only the vaccine with 60 µg HA/dose is able to fullfil all CHMP criteria for all the methods considered; infact, the vaccine with only 30 µg HA/dose is able to fullfil the three CHMP criteria only in HI assay. Another important aspect to consider is the number of doses to administer in order to elicit a proper immune response: infact from the results emerged that a second dose of vaccine is recommended to obtain a statistically significant antibody increase in all cohorts. The results obtained showed a good and positive level of correlation, confirming the hypotesis of this vaccine to be able to elicit a broader specrum of antibody. It is not very easy to correlate the results obtained with the three different assays because of they detect the presence of different Abs classes: SRH assay detects the IgG 1 and IgG 3 implicate in the complement fixation reaction and direct only against the HA 1 subunit, the HI assay lets to detect all antibodies that bind the HA 1, then the MN is able to relieve the functional antibodies involved in neutralization reaction and directed both against HA 1 both HA 2 domains. Is {{important to keep in mind}} that this vaccine does not contain any adjuvants, generally used in seasonal vaccine in order to increase the immune response in elderly and immunocompromised people. In this study the majority of population resulted completely naïve against the A/H 5 N 1 /Indonesia/ 05 / 2005. This could explain why the concentrations of HA/dose generally used in intramuscolar vaccines (10 - 15 µg HA/dose) are not able to elicit a good antibody response in the majority of subjects in the present study. So, it would be interesting to evaluate the efficacy of this IM with the addition of an adjuvant in the formulation in order to reduce the HA concentration per dose; this introduction could be useful for the process of vaccines production (less HA concentration for dose would let to have more doses of vaccine available). Then, analyzing the same vaccine but administered through the intradermal route, and containing 15 µg HA/dose, it emerged that this vaccine does not fullfil none of the CHMP criteria neither in SRH nor in HI. Even though the results do not exceed the cut-off, is possible to see a statistically significant increase in antibody titers in the serum of the patients between pre and post vaccination. A first advantage is called “Dose-Sparing Concept”, that is using the same HA concentration for dose (15 µg), the intradermal vaccine let to use the half volume to injection respect a intramuscolar dose; in this way, in case of pandemic, it will be available a number of intradermal doses equal to twice the number of intramuscolar doses. This concept was re-evaluated in 2009 during the A/H 1 N 1 “swine” outbreak. Another important advantage of intradermal vaccine is the easier way of administration. Infact, nowadays, special devices with micro-needles are present on the market and they let a quick, easy, painless and without side effects (e. g. no fever) administration. In case of trained personnel (such as: physicians, nurses etc.) the intradermal injection can be made in self-administration. Considering all these advantages it is clear how the choice of a new intradermal vaccine, it could be the winning choice for an efficient vaccine production and administration in case of influenza pandemic...|$|R
