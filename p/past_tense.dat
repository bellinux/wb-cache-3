5|$|Further aspectual distinctions are encoded {{by the use}} of {{auxiliary}} verbs, primarily {{have and}} be, which encode the contrast between a perfect and non-perfect <b>past</b> <b>tense</b> (I have run vs. I was running), and compound tenses such as preterite perfect (I had been running) and present perfect (I have been running).|$|E

ABSTRACT: This work in the field of French linguistics gives a partial view of the system of <b>past</b> <b>tenses</b> in French, and their use in the work of contemporary French writer. It is divided into two main parts, theoretical part and a practical part, which are complemented by an introduction and a conclusion summarizing the results of the analysis. In the theoretical part, the author first outlines the relationship between the perception of time and language, and then presents the different <b>past</b> <b>tenses</b> by studying mainly French and Czech linguists. For each tense they are presented the characteristics and uses of the abundant number of examples. The practical part is devoted to analysis of the use of <b>past</b> <b>tenses</b> in three selected works of French writer. There is emphasized ratio of occurrences in different works and how they use. Based on the analysis drawn appropriate partial conclusions about the current application of <b>past</b> <b>tenses</b> in literary writing.

40|$|The master's thesis {{examines}} {{the meaning of}} the <b>past</b> <b>tenses</b> used by Albert Camus in his novels The Stranger and The Fall and the possibility of their transfer to Czech. The present thesis takes a theoretical and empirical approach. The theoretical part provides an overview of the French <b>past</b> <b>tenses</b> and their meanings and deals with their functions within the narrative text. It also attempts to express the specific use of French <b>past</b> <b>tenses</b> in Camus's works analysed. The thesis does not omit describe the possibilities that the Czech language has to express the past. The empirical part is devoted to the analysis of the existing Czech translations of the novels The Stranger and The Fall with an emphasis on capturing the meanings of the <b>past</b> <b>tenses</b> defined in the theoretical part. Using the Czech translations, it seeks ways of creating equivalent effects in Czech and compares the translators' approaches.

5|$|For the {{expression}} of mood, English uses a number of modal auxiliaries, such as can, may, will, shall and the <b>past</b> <b>tense</b> forms could, might, would, should. There is also a subjunctive and an imperative mood, both based on the plain form of the verb (i.e. without the third person singular -s), and which is used in subordinate clauses (e.g. subjunctive: It is important that he run every day; imperative Run!).|$|E
5|$|Verb {{morphology}} in Wagiman {{is highly}} irregular.

5|$|Biblical Hebrew has {{two main}} {{conjugation}} types, the suffix conjugation, {{also called the}} Perfect, and the prefix conjugation, also called Imperfect. The Perfect verb form expressed {{the idea of the}} verb as a completed action, viewing it from start to finish as a whole, and not focusing on the process by which the verb came to be completed, stating it as a simple fact. This is often used in the <b>past</b> <b>tense,</b> however there are some contexts in which a Perfect verb translates into the present and future tenses.|$|E

5|$|Christodorus of Coptus, an Egyptian {{poet and}} writer wrote a lengthy (416 lines long) hexameter piece of poetry {{inspired}} by {{the glory of the}} statues housed within the halls of the Baths of Zeuxippus. This poem actually consisted of a number of short epigrams (six in total), each focusing on one or a small group of statues within the Baths, designed to combine to form one work. While {{it has been suggested that}} the epigrams of Christodorus of Coptus may actually have been inscribed on the (bases) of the statues themselves, this is unlikely because of his use of the ekphrastic medium, and the presence of the <b>past</b> <b>tense</b> in the text.|$|E
5|$|Parish and Shaw did {{not mention}} what time of year the {{tradition}} took place on or its geographical location. They also made no reference to a sack concealing the person carrying the horse. Doel thought it likely that neither Parish or Shaw had ever seen a hooden horse, and that instead their information was based on older written sources. He also thought it noteworthy that they described the tradition using the <b>past</b> <b>tense,</b> indicating that they considered it to be either dead or dying {{at the time of}} writing. However, Maylam believed that the information regarding the decline of the tradition was erroneous, because hoodeners were still active in St. Nicholas-at-Wade during the early twentieth century and various locals living in the area at the time could recall it taking place in the area back to the 1840s.|$|E

The problem formulation of this research are: 1. How is the students’ mastery on <b>past</b> <b>tenses,</b> 2. How is the students ability in speaking English, 3. Is there any correlation between students’ mastery on <b>past</b> <b>tenses</b> and their ability in speaking English. 	The population in this research are 104 students of the fourth semester of English Department of Tarbiyah Faculty of IAIN Antasari Banjarmasin academic year 2012 / 2013. The sample of the research are 52 students of the fourth semester of English Department of Tarbiyah Faculty of IAIN Antasari Banjarmasin academic year 2012 / 2013. 	To collect the data, the writer uses some techniques such as observation, test, documentary and interview.

40|$|The way to {{communicate}} our idea we have is using language. Language takes {{an important role in}} the communication where people need to use their background knowledge of the language to share their ideas. By having strong knowledge of language, people will share the ideas easily. The obstacles of transferring ideas sometimes is from the limitation of the language we have. There are two ways of transferring our ideas; speaking and writing. If someone has a few knowledge of the language, it will be quite hard to express what he has. Based on this phenomena, the research wants to find out how well the students of the English Education Study Program have mastered the English <b>Past</b> <b>Tenses</b> and applied the knowledge of the English <b>Past</b> <b>Tenses</b> in writing Recount Text. The study investigated how the knowledge of the English <b>Past</b> <b>Tenses</b> is applied in the Recount Text. This is kind of Descriptive Qualitative Research where the Interpretive Analysis was used to explain the phenomenon found by the researcher. The instrument was 100 numbers of Multiple Choice Test Items. There were 25 <b>Past</b> Simple <b>Tenses,</b> 25 <b>Past</b> Continuous <b>Tense,</b> 25 <b>Past</b> Perfect Simple <b>Tense,</b> and 25 <b>Past</b> Perfect Continuous <b>Tense.</b> The researcher also took the Recount Text compositions made by the Writing I-C students of English Education Study Program Widya Mandala Catholic University 2014 / 2015. To make sure the instrument was such a good test, the researcher needed to validate and find the reliability of it. The researcher used Rank Different Correlation Coefficient to get the validity of the test and the result was 0. 75. It means there is a good or probably almost perfect relationship between the mastery of the English <b>Past</b> <b>Tenses</b> and the application of the English <b>Past</b> <b>Tenses.</b> KR 21 /Kuder-Richardson formula 21 also used by the researcher to find out the validity of the test. It is used because the researcher only gave single administration of a single form of a test. The result of the KR 21 was 0. 941 meaning the test has high reliability. After analyzing the result of the mastery and the application of the English <b>Past</b> <b>Tenses</b> of the students, the researcher found out that the knowledge the students have plays an important role in applying in the Recount Text composition. The students who have mastered the English <b>Past</b> <b>Tenses</b> were able to apply the grammar well in the Recount Text compositions. The strong knowledge of the English <b>Past</b> <b>Tenses</b> could be seen from the fascinating result of the Multiple Choice Test given. By getting more than 80...|$|R
