40|$|Iatrogenic {{transmission}} of prions {{through use of}} surgical instruments has been shown both experimentally and clinically. In addition, recent discoveries of prion protein accumulation in peripheral tissues such as appendix and muscle, and evidence suggesting human-to-human blood-borne transmission, {{have led to a}} concern that any residual soiling containing this agent may remain infectious even after sterile service processing. Removal of all proteinaceous material from surgical devices is extremely important for effective sterilization. This removal can be severely hampered if the contaminant is allowed to dry onto the instrument surface for any length of time. The current move to centralize sterile service centres and the inevitable lengthening of transport time between theatres and re-processing makes it necessary to minimize the amount of residual soiling adhering to an instrument before sterilization. This investigation simulates the period between the application of surgical instruments in theatre and their initial pre-wash by a washer/disinfector. The aim was to investigate the kinetics of drying at different temperatures, and the application of different commercially available pre-soak solutions in situ. The findings show that all <b>pre-soaks</b> significantly reduce (by up to 96 %) the prion-infected tissue contamination, and that controlling the temperature whilst in transit between theatres and cleaning facilities may allow an increase in time before high protein adsorption levels occu...|$|E
40|$|Purpose To {{compare the}} in vivo surface {{wettability}} of silicone hydrogel (SiHy) contact lenses <b>pre-soaked</b> overnight in different multipurpose solutions (MPS) and normal saline. Methods In this double-blinded, randomized and self-controlled study, 36 subjects were fitted with {{three pairs of}} contact lenses (senofilcon A) <b>pre-soaked</b> overnight in five different MPS and saline in a randomized order. Each pair of lenses (<b>pre-soaked</b> in two different solutions the night before) were worn for 15 min before assessment of pre-lens non-invasive tear break-up time (PL-NITBUT) using the Medmont corneal topographer (video recording). Corneal integrity was assessed using a slit lamp and a resting interval of 20 min was allowed between each pair of lenses to ensure post-lens wear corneal integrity. Results Thirty subjects completed the study. The median PL-NITBUT ranged from 2. 84 s to 3. 08 s with lenses <b>pre-soaked</b> in different MPS, compared to 2. 78 s with lenses <b>pre-soaked</b> in saline. No significant differences in PL-NITBUT were found among lenses <b>pre-soaked</b> in different solutions (p = 0. 647).

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the <b>pre-soaking</b> of hamstring grafts in topical vancomycin, {{in addition to}} IV prophylaxis, during anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction to {{reduce the incidence of}} post-operative infection, and to describe an evidence-based diagnostic and treatment algorithm to facilitate early diagnosis and appropriate management of possible knee sepsis post-operatively after ACL reconstruction. Methods: This study is a controlled observational series comprising of 1585 individuals who underwent ACL reconstruction over a 13 -year period. All surgeries were performed by a single surgeon at the same hospital. Group 1 consisted of 285 patients who received pre-operative IV antibiotics without topical graft <b>pre-soaking.</b> Group 2 consisted of 1300 individuals who received IV antibiotics and graft <b>pre-soaking</b> in a vancomycin solution of 5 mg/mL. Results: In group 1, a total of four patients suffered a post-operative joint infection (1. 4 %). Three out of the four were culture positive for Staphylococcus species. The fourth was culture negative but was managed as an acute infection. Group 2 suffered no post-operative infections (0 %). Statistical analysis of the vancomycin <b>pre-soak</b> with IV antibiotics group, compared with IV antibiotics-alone group, revealed a significantly reduced post-operative infection rate using a Fisher’s exact test (P = 0. 0011) and Chi-square test with Yates’ correction (P = 0. 0003). Conclusions: <b>Pre-soaking</b> of hamstrings grafts with topical vancomycin reduced the rate of post-operative infection when compared to IV antibiotics alone.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study into the use of fine aggregate from construction and demolition waste (C&DW) in the South African construction industry, and the impact this has on the important fresh and hardened properties of concrete when used as partial replacement for virgin materials. The C&DW were tested at replacement levels of 0 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 %. The recycled fine aggregate was <b>pre-soaked</b> to mitigate the expected effect of higher water absorption of recycled concrete aggregate (RCA). However, <b>pre-soaking</b> of the fines attributed to the poor performance of the fresh and hardened properties of the concrete. The <b>pre-soaking</b> procedure used was problematic when used with fine aggregates and caused a large amount of excess water {{to be added to the}} concrete mix as a result. This study highlights the importance of planning the demolition process of a structure to ensure that the best possible quality of RCA can be extracted. The study revealed that the use of recycled fine aggregate as a replacement of virgin materials in the manufacture of concrete has a much greater negative impact than the use of coarse recycled aggregates.

The seeds {{were divided into two}} groups, the first group soaked with distilled water, while the second group were soaked with 3 mM KNO 3, respectively, for 4 hours. Seeds were sown and left to grow for 3 weeks then treated with different concentrations of NaCl (0. 0, 40, 80, 120 and 160 mM) by top irrigation, then they left to grow further for 65 days from sowing. Plant samples were collected for some measurements: leaf area, plant height, root length, fresh and dry weight, photosynthetic pigments, carotenoids, soluble sugars, soluble proteins, total free amino acids, esterase enzyme, as well as MDA (malondialdehyde) content. Salinity reduced both fresh and dry weight in two broad bean cultivars, this reduction were more pronounced in Sakha 3 than Nobaria 3. Seed <b>pre-soaking</b> with KNO 3 resulted in enhancement of fresh and dry weight production in both cultivars especially at 40 mM NaCl. Photosynthetic pigments were substantially affected by salt treatment while the carotenoids were increased, seed <b>pre-soaking</b> with KNO 3 improved these components. The soluble sugars, amino acids as well as soluble proteins showed various responses with increasing salinity in the cultivars, seed <b>pre-soaking</b> with KNO 3 has improved these parameters to some extent. The shoots of two cultivars exhibited significant accumulation of MDA, compared to roots exposed to the highest salinity levels. <b>Pre-soaking</b> seeds with KNO 3 did not improve MDA in shoots but enhanced it in roots, however, in most cases still lower than the absolute control.

Germination was strongly suppressed by PG or BHAM at concentration above 2 mM.

40|$|In {{previous}} papers {{the mechanism}} and {{dynamics of the}} elution of gold cyanide from activated carbon have been investigated in detail. Sub processes such as the <b>pre-soaking</b> step, the degradation of cyanide, the elution of the spectator cations, the associated shift in the equilibrium of adsorption or desorption {{as a result of}} the removal of cations, the reactivation of the carbon surface, and the elution of gold cyanide have been explained quantitatively to some extent, although further work is evidently required Previous work has also shown that equilibrium conditions may be' assumed when adsorption is weak, hence when aggressive <b>pre-soaking</b> conditions have been used. However, these studies have not taken the competitive effect of base metals into account, although this is known to have an adverse effect on the efficiency of gold elution. The present study has shown quantitatively that copper has a significant effect on the recovery of gold. Nickel and silver also have a detrimental effect, but only if they are present as high loadings. In contrast, the elution of the base metals is to a large degree unaffected by the elution of gold. It is shown in this paper that the multi-component equilibrium relationship between the spectator cations and the various metal cyanides can be very complex, and perhaps ill-defined. In such circumstances it is preferable to use a non-parametric technique such as a back-propagation neural network to represent such an equilibrium relationship.

Therefore, internal and external factors to seed which directly interfere in the process, they must be identified, in order to adapt better techniques to obtain seedlings. In this sense, this work aimed to optimize the in vitro germination of Genipa americana L. seeds by evaluating different factors (light quality, GA 3 treatment, <b>pre-soaking</b> in distilled water, growing media and stratification in the dark).
