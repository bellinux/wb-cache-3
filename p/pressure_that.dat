5|$|Cyclone Graham of the 2002–03 Australian region cyclone {{season was}} a weak {{tropical}} storm that affected Australia during late February and early March 2003. Graham originated {{from an area}} of convection that emerged onto water after sitting over Australia on 23 February. The interaction with a monsoon trough formed an area of low <b>pressure</b> <b>that</b> developed into Tropical Cyclone Graham on 27 February. The storm moved slowly to the east-southeast, and after turning to the south it peaked as a tropical storm and made landfall on Western Australia the next day. The cyclone weakened as it moved inland, and dissipated on 1 March. The storm dropped heavy rainfall and caused high winds, which produced flooding and downed trees. One fatality occurred, though no significant damages were reported.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Kate {{originated}} {{from an area}} of low <b>pressure</b> <b>that</b> was first identified on 22 February 2006, within a monsoonal trough. The system rapidly intensified throughout the day, with the Australian Bureau of Meteorology issuing their first advisory on the system that evening. Upon being classified, the system was immediately declared Tropical Cyclone Kate, skipping tropical low status. At the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also began issuing advisories on the system, designating it as Tropical Cyclone 13P. The storm had developed well-defined, upper-level outflow enhanced by diffluence over the system.|$|E

5|$|It {{originated}} {{in an area}} of low <b>pressure</b> <b>that</b> developed over the western Gulf of Mexico on December10, downstream from an upper-level cyclone. The surface low tracked northward to Oklahoma before turning eastward as it gradually intensified. Simultaneously, a shortwave trough swung southeastward around the periphery of a large vortex over central and eastern Canada. As the upper low opened up into a negatively tilted trough and began to interact with the northern wave, a secondary surface cyclone developed along a frontal boundary over South Carolina late on December11. Almost immediately thereafter, the original low dissipated over West Virginia. Heading toward the northeast, the incipient storm emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, at 00:00UTC on December12.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Grace {{go back to}} a mid-level area of low <b>pressure</b> <b>that</b> formed on October 23 to the south of Bermuda. Reports from a nearby ship {{indicated}} that the low had become a surface feature by October 25. The storm system initially contained subtropical characteristics, and the center of circulation lacked deep convection for several days. The system was designated a subtropical storm on October 26. An area of clouds near Bermuda became increasingly convective, and gradually became entrained into the expanding and developing circulation of the subtropical storm. Thunderstorm activity persisted near the center, and on October 27, the storm attained tropical storm status and was named Grace.|$|E
5|$|The {{selective}} <b>pressure</b> <b>that</b> {{shaped the}} original lemuriform toothcomb {{has been a}} topic of considerable debate since the 1970s. Evidence {{can be seen as}} supporting a grooming function, food procurement function, or both. In the early 1900s, there was less debate. Grooming was seen as the primary function since primates lack the claws needed to adequately comb the fur, although prosimian primates (strepsirrhines and tarsiers) possess at least one grooming claw on each foot to compensate. Grooming—in the form of fur-combing—is generally considered the primary function and original role of the lemuriform toothcomb, and subsequent changes in morphology across multiple lineages have altered its function and obscured its original function.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{increasing}} {{threat to}} information security has created institutional pressures on organizations {{to comply with}} information security policies and standards. This paper presents an empirical study to investigate the impact of institutional pressures (coercive, normative, and mimetic) on information security compliance in organizations. The results show <b>that</b> coercive <b>pressures</b> <b>that</b> are manifested by regulatory agencies, normative <b>pressures</b> <b>that</b> are exerted through social pressures, and mimetic <b>pressures</b> <b>that</b> are manifested by security benefits positively influence information security compliance in public organizations. Furthermore, the results reveal that regulation and security benefits generate pressures on management to strengthen their commitments towards information security compliance in organizations. It is, however, worthwhile to notice <b>that</b> social <b>pressures</b> {{do not have a}} significant impact on management commitments towards information security compliance. The implications of this study indicate the criticality of institutional pressures for enhancing information security compliance in public organizations both directly and indirectly...|$|R
5|$|The tawny {{nurse shark}} {{may be one of}} the few fishes specializing in preying on octopus. Other known food items include corals, sea urchins, {{crustaceans}} (e.g. crabs and lobsters), squid, small fishes (e.g. surgeonfish, queenfish, and rabbitfish), and the occasional sea snake. Hunting {{tawny nurse shark}}s swim slowly just above the sea floor, poking their heads into depressions and holes. When a prey item is found, the shark forcefully expands its large, muscular pharynx, creating a powerful negative <b>pressure</b> <b>that</b> sucks the prey into its mouth.|$|E
5|$|There {{was little}} support for {{compulsory}} military service amongst the public, however, and combined with the financial <b>pressure</b> <b>that</b> the government felt {{at that time to}} reduce defence spending, the 1920 recommendations were not fully implemented. Although the compulsory training scheme was retained, it was decided that it would only be focused on the more populated areas, essentially ending the scheme in rural areas. The result of this was that the course of only a year the strength of the Citizens Forces fell from 127,000 to only 37,000 in 1922. Throughout the 1920s, numbers decreased even further and although the divisional structure was maintained, it {{was little more than a}} skeleton force as units found their numbers dropping drastically.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Cyclone Emma {{originated}} {{from an area}} of low <b>pressure</b> <b>that</b> formed to the southeast of Java on 22 February 2006. Over the following few days, a monsoonal trough developed over the Timor Sea, leading to an increased likelihood of tropical cyclone formation from the initial low within several days. On 25 February, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology began monitoring {{the system as a}} tropical low. The low tracked slowly towards the south throughout the day and the centre of circulation relocated farther south late on 26 February. By this time, the Bureau of Meteorology anticipated the low to develop into a tropical cyclone and attain winds of 95km/h (60mph 10-minute sustained) before moving over land in Western Australia.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Depression Five-E was a {{tropical}} depression which made landfall along the south-western Mexican coastline in July 2008. It {{was the fifth}} tropical cyclone of the 2008 Pacific hurricane season. The depression developed out of a weak tropical wave which formed {{off the coast of}} Africa on June 23. The wave remained poorly organized throughout its journey through the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. The wave entered the Eastern Pacific on July 2 after passing through Central America.

It quickly organized and reached tropical storm strength before making landfall on southeastern Louisiana. Bertha turned to the southwest over the state, and re-entered the Gulf of Mexico on August 7. It remained disorganized due to proximity to land, and after making landfall on south Texas, Bertha dissipated on August 9.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Gerald, one {{of three}} typhoons to form from the monsoon trough in early September1987, {{originated}} from an area of low <b>pressure</b> <b>that</b> developed {{to the east of}} the Philippines over the South China Sea. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started tracking the low at 06:00UTC on September2, after convection persisted. Two and a half hours later, the agency issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA), but almost immediately thereafter, shower and thunderstorm activity rapidly diminished due to decreased poleward outflow and increased wind shear. Despite this, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started tracking the system at 00:00UTC on September3. Eight hours later, the TCFA was cancelled.|$|E
