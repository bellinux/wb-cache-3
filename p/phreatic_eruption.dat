5|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} types of eruptions. The most well-observed are magmatic eruptions, which involve the decompression of gas within magma that propels it forward. Phreatomagmatic eruptions are another type of volcanic eruption, driven by the compression of gas within magma, the direct opposite of the process powering magmatic activity. The third eruptive type is the <b>phreatic</b> <b>eruption,</b> which {{is driven by the}} superheating of steam via contact with magma; these eruptive types often exhibit no magmatic release, instead causing the granulation of existing rock.|$|E
5|$|In April 1989, Voight {{returned}} to Colombia to the volcano Galeras after being {{contacted by the}} United Nations Disaster Relief Organization. People in Pasto, located {{at the foot of}} the volcano, had become alarmed by noises and shaking from Galeras. While Galeras proved far easier to climb than Nevado del Ruiz, land mines planted to hinder guerrilla forces dotted the slopes of the mountain. With USGS geologist Dick Janda, Voight drew a hazard map that included several populated areas within the danger zone. Before Voight left Galeras, the volcano underwent an unexpected <b>phreatic</b> <b>eruption,</b> which Voight and his team failed to predict. Although Pasto was unaffected, six scientists attending a United Nations workshop for natural disaster relief were killed. After reviewing deformation data from the day before the eruption, Voight discovered that no acceleration in the deformation process had occurred. He surmised that phreatic eruptions do not exhibit an acceleration in deformation before taking place and left after confirming that the volcano's monitoring system functioned properly.|$|E
25|$|Historical {{records and}} oral history {{document}} a <b>phreatic</b> <b>eruption</b> on July 2, 1840 and pyroclastic flow from radial fissures {{on the upper}} north flank of Mount Ararat and a possibly associated earthquake of magnitude 7.4 that caused severe damage and numerous casualties. Up to 10,000 people in the Mount Ararat region died in the earthquake, including 1,900 villagers {{in the village of}} Akhuri (Armenian: Akori, modern Yenidoğan) who were killed by a gigantic landslide and subsequent debris flow. In addition, this combination of landslide and debris flow destroyed the Armenian monastery of St. Jacob near Akori, the town of Aralik, several villages, and Russian military barracks. It also temporarily dammed the Sevjur (Metsamor) River.|$|E
30|$|Here, {{we aim to}} {{investigate}} the mechanisms of the <b>phreatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> of Ioto. Some <b>phreatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> have been accompanied by clear precursors. However, eruptions without precursors have also been reported. <b>Phreatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> and related activities such as earthquakes, deformation and fumaroles on the ground {{are considered to be}} related with hydrothermal reservoirs of shallow depths (e.g., Kaneshima et al. 1996). We will clarify the relationship between <b>phreatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> and hydrothermal reservoirs in Ioto with seismic and crustal deformation data. Although the scale of <b>phreatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> is small in Ioto, they are frequent, occurring everywhere on the island. Elucidation of the regularity and mechanisms of <b>phreatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> helps to reduce the risk to residents on the island.|$|R
30|$|Active {{geothermal}} {{areas at}} shallow depth have a potential of <b>phreatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> {{because of the}} instabilities in hydrothermal activities. Minor layers of tephra deposits commonly found near the geothermal area [e.g., Owakudani geothermal area of the Hakone volcano (Kobayashi et al. 2006)] indicate the repetition of <b>phreatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> from active geothermal system. Despite their frequent occurrence and the potential risks, <b>phreatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> remain poorly described, because of poor preservation and indistinctive features of the deposits.|$|R
30|$|<b>Phreatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> are eruptions {{in which}} magmatic {{processes}} {{are not the}} principal driving mechanism. Rather, broadly defined hydrothermal processes (i.e., interactions among water, rocks, and magmatic heat and gas) play the key role in generating <b>phreatic</b> <b>eruptions.</b> On our wet planet, explosive interactions between volcanoes and meteoric water are extremely diverse. <b>Phreatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> encompass steam-driven explosions generated by magma intruding fluvial sediments and aquifers, lava or pyroclastic flows interacting with surface water, geyser-like explosions driven by depressurization of near boiling-point subterranean geothermal water, and volcanic eruptions expelling hydrothermal systems formed during periods of repose (e.g., Barberi et al. 1992; Rouwet et al. 2014). In contrast to magmatic eruptions, a broadly accepted classification scheme of <b>phreatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> is lacking.|$|R
25|$|On May 7, 2013, at 8 a.m. (PST), {{the volcano}} {{produced}} a surprise <b>phreatic</b> <b>eruption</b> lasting 73 seconds. Ash, steam and rock were produced during this eruption. Ash clouds reached 500 meters above the volcano's summit and drifted west southwest. The event killed five climbers, of whom three were German, {{one was a}} Spaniard living in Germany, and one was a Filipino tour guide. Seven others were reported injured. The bodies of the hikers were soon located by the authorities. However, due to rugged and slippery terrain, the hikers' remains were slowly transferred from Camp 2 to Camp 1, {{the site of the}} rescue operations {{at the foot of the}} volcano. According to Dr. Butch Rivera of Bicol Regional Training and Teaching Hospital, the hikers died due to trauma in their bodies, and suffocation. Authorities were also able to rescue a Thai national who was unable to walk due to fatigue and had suffered a broken arm and burns on the neck and back.|$|E
500|$|After the Halemaumau event, Kīlauea {{remained}} relatively quiet, and, for a time, completely silent, with all activity {{confined to the}} summit. It came alive again in 1952 with an enormous lava fountain [...] high at the Halemaumau Crater. Multiple continuous lava fountains between [...] persisted, and the eruption lasted 136 days. Eruptions occurred soon after in 1954, 1955, and 1959, capped by a large event in 1960, when fissure-based <b>phreatic</b> <b>eruption</b> and earthquake activity {{gave way to a}} massive a'a flow that overran multiple evacuated communities and resorts; the resulting summit deflation eventually caused the ever-active Halemaumau to collapse even further.|$|E
500|$|Since {{its last}} eruptive {{activity}} in the mid-19th century, Mount St. Helens had been largely dormant. Seismographs were not installed until 1972. This period of more than 100 years of inactivity ended in early 1980. On March 15, a cluster of tiny earthquakes rocked {{the area around the}} mountain. For six days, more than 100 earthquakes clustered around Mount St. Helens, an indication that magma was moving. There was initially some doubt as to whether the earthquakes were precursors to an eruption. By March 20, a magnitude 4.2 earthquake shook the wilderness around the volcano. The next day, seismologists installed three seismic recorder stations. By March 24, volcanologists at the USGS—including Johnston—became more confident that the seismic activity was a sign of an impending eruption. After March 25, seismic activity drastically increased. By March 26, more than seven earthquakes over magnitude 4.0 had been recorded, and the next day, hazard warnings were publicly issued. On March 27, a <b>phreatic</b> <b>eruption</b> took place, ejecting a plume of ash nearly [...] into the air.|$|E
30|$|In this study, {{we explore}} with mainly seismological means <b>phreatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> and the {{hydrothermal}} systems responses at two similar volcanoes, Kawah Ijen, Indonesia and White Island, New Zealand. We focus on periods of <b>phreatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> which are currently not fully understood, but pose, nevertheless, a considerable volcanic hazard claiming {{time and again}} some human lives. By carefully processing broadband seismic signals, we disclose seismic signatures and characteristics often buried in unprocessed velocity seismograms. These signals shed light on several aspects of <b>phreatic</b> <b>eruptions,</b> their generation and timeline.|$|R
50|$|Phreatomagmatic eruptions are {{volcanic}} eruptions resulting from interaction between magma and water. They differ from exclusively magmatic <b>eruptions</b> and <b>phreatic</b> <b>eruptions.</b> Unlike <b>phreatic</b> <b>eruptions,</b> {{the products of}} phreatomagmatic eruptions contain juvenile (magmatic) clasts. It is common for a large explosive eruption to have magmatic and phreatomagmatic components.|$|R

500|$|Scientists {{flying over}} the volcano on March 8, 2012 noted fresh ash {{deposits}} on the east flank of the volcano near the crater, likely from an <b>phreatic</b> <b>eruption</b> on February 22. [...] Later that day, a small ash plume erupted from the crater; by March 13, scientists detected ash deposits {{at the head of}} the Gualí River. After seismicity continued to increase, the alert level was raised to Orange, and in April Nevados National Natural Park authority closed the reserve, fearing lahars and ashfall hazards. The sudden activity peak in March did not culminate in a major eruption, and activity declined enough that the alert level was lowered to Yellow on May 3. On May 29, seismicity rapidly increased, and the alert level was restored to Orange because ash fell into more than 20 nearby communities. Over the next few months ash fell frequently until earthquakes increased again in June. Because of the severity of these tremors, evacuations were ordered by the Emergency Committee of Caldas on news media for 300–1500 people near the volcano. The alert level was raised to Red, indicating an imminent major volcanic event, and an eruption [...] in diameter took place on July 2, 2012, continuing intermittently until the end of August. Ash plumes and sulfur dioxide emissions recurred until January 2013.|$|E
2500|$|Vulcanian explosions {{occurred}} on 18 April 1993, and on 19–20 April 1993, a major eruption occurred. A <b>phreatic</b> <b>eruption</b> around 14:30 on 18 April formed {{the prelude to}} the eruption. The eruption commenced with two explosions at 6:28 and 9:20 local time, forming eruption columns [...] high. Another explosion at 13:02 sent a column [...] high. At least ten different pulses were observed, generating columns of various heights. Eruption columns formed mushroom clouds. The 1993 eruption lasted 23 hours. The eruption column underwent several collapses, creating pyroclastic flows at least seven to nine times. The strongest pulse {{occurred on}} 20 April between 6:28 and 9:20 and sent flows towards the northwest. This pulse generated an eruption column [...] high. The total mass flux of the eruption was about , comparable to the 1982 eruption of El Chichon. The lava dome in the crater was destroyed and was probably {{the source of the}} lava bombs that were thrown as far as [...] away from the vent; some of these bombs had diameters of [...] and left large impact craters.|$|E

50|$|It is {{believed}} that the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, which obliterated most of the volcanic island and created the loudest sound in recorded history, was a phreatic event. Kilauea, in Hawaii, has a long record of phreatic explosions; a 1924 <b>phreatic</b> <b>eruption</b> hurled rocks estimated at eight tons up to a distance of one kilometer. Additional examples are the 1963-65 eruption of Surtsey, the 1965 eruption of Taal Volcano, the 1982 Mount Tarumae eruption, the 2014 eruption of Mount Ontake and on May 7, 2013, at 8 a.m. (PST) Mayon Volcano produced a surprise <b>phreatic</b> <b>eruption</b> lasting 73 seconds.|$|E
30|$|It is {{difficult}} to detect ground deformation prior to <b>phreatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> because they can occur without obvious magma migration.

30|$|We {{suggest that}} gas ratios {{may be able}} to {{play a key role in}} {{forecasting}} magmatically driven <b>phreatic</b> <b>eruptions.</b> At Poás, the association of decreasing CO 2 /SO 2 and phreatic eruptive activity in April–May 2017 was a clear indication that magma was intruding to very shallow levels, in the process evaporating the hydrothermal system. At Rincón de la Vieja, another volcano in Costa Rica with a crater lake, <b>phreatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> in 2014 were associated with lowered CO 2 /SO 2 and H 2 S/SO 2 (de Moor et al. 2016 b). Recent high-frequency Multi-GAS time series data show that individual <b>phreatic</b> <b>eruptions</b> are associated with pulses of H 2 S-poor magmatic gas (Battaglia et al. 2017).|$|R
