40|$|Defining the {{aggressiveness}} {{and growth}} rate of a malignant cell population is a key step in the clinical approach to treating tumor disease. The correct grading of breast cancer (BC) is a fundamental part in determining the appropriate treatment. Biological variables can {{make it difficult to}} elucidate the mechanisms underlying BC development. To identify potential markers {{that can be used for}} BC classification, we analyzed mRNAs expression <b>profiles,</b> gene <b>copy</b> numbers, microRNAs expression and their association with tumor grade in BC microarray-derived datasets. From mRNA expression results, we found that grade 2 BC is most likely a mixture of grade 1 and grade 3 that have been misclassified, being described by the gene signature of either grade 1 or grade 3. We assessed the potential of the new approach of integrating mRNA expression <b>profile,</b> <b>copy</b> number alterations, and microRNA expression levels to select a limited number of genomic BC biomarkers. The combination of mRNA <b>profile</b> analysis and <b>copy</b> number data with microRNA expression levels led to the identification of two gene signatures of 42 and 4 altered genes (FOXM 1, KPNA 4, H 2 AFV and DDX 19 A) respectively, the latter obtained through a meta-analytical procedure. The 42 -based gene signature identifies 4 classes of up- or down-regulated microRNAs (17 microRNAs) and of their 17 target mRNA, and the 4 -based genes signature identified 4 microRNAs (Hsa-miR- 320 d, Hsa-miR- 139 - 5 p, Hsa-miR- 567 and Hsa-let- 7 c).

40|$|Many {{large-scale}} Java applications {{suffer from}} runtime bloat. They execute {{large volumes of}} methods, and create many temporary objects, all to execute relatively simple operations. There are large opportunities for performance optimizations in these applications, but most are being missed by existing optimization and tooling technology. While JIT optimizations struggle for a few percent, performance experts analyze deployed applications and regularly find gains of 2 × or more. Finding such big gains is difficult, for both humans and compilers, because of the diffuse nature of runtime bloat. Time is spread thinly across calling contexts, {{making it difficult to}} judge how to improve performance. Bloat results from a pile-up of seemingly harmless decisions. Each adds temporary objects and method calls, and often copies values between those temporary objects. While data copies are not the entirety of bloat, we have observed that they are excellent indicators of regions of excessive activity. By optimizing copies, one is likely to remove the objects that carry copied values, and the method calls that allocate and populate them. We introduce <b>copy</b> <b>profiling,</b> a technique that summarizes runtime activity in terms of chains of data copies. A flat <b>copy</b> <b>profile</b> counts <b>copies</b> by method. We show how flat profiles alone can be helpful. In many cases, diagnosing a problem requires data flow context. Tracking and making sense of raw copy chains does not scale, so we introduce a summarizing abstraction called the copy graph. We implement three clients analyses that, using the copy graph, expose common patterns of bloat, such as finding hot copy chains and discovering temporary data structures.

40|$|Cytosine {{methylation}} of repetitive sequences {{is widespread}} in plant genomes, occurring in both symmetric (CpG and CpNpG) {{as well as}} asymmetric sequence contexts. We used the methylation- dependent restriction enzyme McrBC to profile methylated DNA using tiling microarrays of Arabidopsis Chromosome 4 in two distinct ecotypes, Columbia and Landsberg erecta. We also used comparative genome hybridization to <b>profile</b> <b>copy</b> number polymorphisms. Repeated sequences and transposable elements (TEs), especially long terminal repeat retrotransposons, are densely methylated, but one third of genes also have low but detectable methylation in their transcribed regions. While TEs are almost always methylated, genic methylation is highly polymorphic, with half of all methylated genes being methylated in {{only one of the}} two ecotypes. A survey of loci in 96 Arabidopsis accessions revealed a similar degree of methylation polymorphism. Within-gene methylation is heritable, but is lost at a high frequency in segregating F- 2 families. Promoter methylation is rare, and gene expression is not generally affected by differences in DNA methylation. Small interfering RNA are preferentially associated with methylated TEs, but not with methylated genes, indicating that most genic methylation is not guided by small interfering RNA. This may account for the instability of gene methylation, if occasional failure of maintenance methylation cannot be restored by other means...|$|R

Treatment options are currently limited and are dependent on the clinical context. Interventions include surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery with few metastases, with whole brain radiotherapy serving a role in patients with several metastases. In recent years, there have been increased efforts directed towards early phase trials to address the role of targeted biological agents towards pathogenic drivers namely, EGFR, HER 2 and BRAF. Due to the location and appropriateness of the clinical situation biopsies are impractical in these patients. In this DPhil, I have characterised the genomic landscape of a cohort of brain metastases of 4 colorectal, 7 ductal breast and 7 lung adenocarcinomas. Analysis of genomes involved: characterisation of mutation burdens, spectra and signatures, <b>profiling</b> <b>copy</b> number aberrations, driver gene discovery and reconstructing the clonal architecture of the genomes. Unpaired primary tumours from The Cancer Genome Atlas, and published reports served as a comparative tool to evaluate the degree of heterogeneity compared to primary tumours. The brain metastases generally resembled primary tumours with regards to mutation burdens, spectra and signatures. Drivers of primary tumours including those targeted by current biological agents were generally, though not universally located in major clonal groups in the metastases. Increased chromosomal instability was observed in the metastases. Although my sample size was modest the brain metastases had an increased number of copy number alterations in comparison to primary tumours. Furthermore, my findings suggest that chromothripsis may occur more frequently in brain metastases.

40|$|Cam {{mechanisms}} {{have many}} applications in automatic machinery. Considerations of dynamic performance require the profile shape {{to be defined}} indirectly from the follower motion, the flexibility of timing and configuration introducing additional variables. Consequently the design and manufacture of new master cams using conventional techniques is laborious and expensive. Precision is essential since the follower motion is sensitive to minor dimensional inaccuracies and discontinuities of curvature. The object of this investigation is to simplify both the design and manufacture of a new master cam. The author's survey of previous work showed it necessary to establish the design sequence before the processes involving greatest effort could be isolated. His associated study of existing <b>profile</b> <b>copying</b> and generating devices found none which satisfied the criterion of extensive application, but identified weaknesses of previous designs. This thesis considers the adaption of the copying principle to manufacture cam profiles from the intrinsic shape of a leaf spring deflected to suit specified boundary conditions, so eliminating dependence upon co-ordinate data, complex transmissions and special templates whilst relying upon the repeatability of an instrument in preference to the positioning accuracy of a machine-tool. Profiles for two distinct follower motions can be derived by this means, their characteristics resembling those of SHM and cycloidal motion respectively. The characteristics are functions of the displacement equation. A search revealed no comparison nor experimental verification of previously published analyses of the elastica. Limitations of the previous analyses led the author to derive new solutions using the method of perturbations; these {{have the advantage of}} simple computation and give a direct solution for any intermediate position.
