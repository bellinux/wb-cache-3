The relationship of defect - occupants’ satisfaction - loyalty behavior in the Build-then-sell houses however {{is yet to be}} explored. Thus, the aim {{of this study is to}} identify the relationship between the three mentioned va riables. Data were collected from the occupants who have stayed in the Build-Then-Sell houses for three years; a period whereby housing defect (<b>patent</b> <b>defect)</b> would normally occur. Housing defect was measured using three severity levels; low, medium and hi gh and was cross-tabulated with the dichotomous question of satisfied and dissatisfied occupants. Subsequently, occupants’ satisfaction was cross-tabulated with their loyalty behavior. The Pearson chi-square result shows a significant correlation between housing defects and occupants’ satisfaction. Meanwhile, for the occupants’ satisfaction and loyalty behavior, there is no significant correlation between the variables. The cross-tabulation for occupants’ satisfaction – loyalty behavior reveals that the large portions of satisfied as well as dissatisfied occupants tend to project loyal behavior towards Build -Then-Sell houses. The result implies that defect is a factor which relates to occupants’ satisfaction but the occupants’ satisfaction is not a factor th at relates to occupants’ loyalty behavior...|$|E

40|$|This Article {{represents}} {{the first attempt}} to study empirically the factors that cause courts to impose disclosure duties on bargaining parties in some circumstances, but not in others. We analyze data coded from 466 decisions spanning {{a wide array of}} jurisdictions and covering over two hundred years. The results are mixed. In some instances our data support the conventional wisdom relating to common-law disclosure duties. For example, we find that courts are more likely to require the disclosure of latent, as opposed to <b>patent,</b> <b>defects</b> {{and are more likely to}} require disclosure when the parties are in a fiduciary or confidential relationship. In other instances, our results cast doubt on much of the conventional wisdom regarding the law of fraudulent silence. First, although it is generally understood that courts have become more likely to impose disclosure duties over time, we find that courts actually have become less likely over time to impose duties to disclose. Second, and perhaps most importantly, we find that courts are no more likely to impose disclosure duties when the information is casually acquired as opposed to deliberately acquired, and that unequal access to information by the contracting parties is not a significant factor that drives courts to find a duty to disclose. We do find, however, that when both factors are present courts are significantly more likely to force disclosure...|$|R
40|$|Purpose : To {{investigate}} {{the nature of}} deviant voice physiology in preoperative children with congenital heart disease. Methods : Ninety-four children with congenital heart disease were enrolled. Their cries and related acoustic variables (fundamental frequency, duration, noise to harmonic ratio, jitter?# 737;?and shimmer) were analyzed using a multi-dimensional voice program. Results : The average fundamental frequency showed {{a significant decrease in}} patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular septal defect, and tetralogy of Fallot, except in atrial septal defect and pulmonary stenosis. The length of the analyzed sample (duration) did not show a significant difference when compared with the control group. There was a significant increase in jitter percent in ventricular septal <b>defect,</b> <b>patent</b> ductus arteriosus, and atrial septal defect. There was an increase in shimmer in ventricular septal <b>defect,</b> <b>patent</b> ductus arteriosus, and atrial septal defect. The noise-to-harmonic ratio increased in ventricular septal <b>defect,</b> <b>patent</b> ductus arteriosus, and atrial septal defect but {{there was no significant difference}} in pulmonary stenosis and tetralogy of Fallot. While analyzing acoustic variables, the voice change was significantly higher, especially in patent ductus arteriosus followed by ventricular septal defect and atrial septal defect. Most of these acoustic variables were deviant in left-to-right shunt lesions in congenital heart disease, especially in patent ductus artriosus.

40|$|The common-law rule, still {{followed}} {{in the majority of}} jurisdictions, is that unless a lease involves the rental of a furnished dwelling for a very short duration, there is no implied warranty that the rented premises are habitable and generally fit for the tenant to live in. The rule has been expressly predicated on the familiar doctrine of caveat emptor and implicitly predicated on a number of agrarian leasehold assumptions. Commentators have vigorously attacked the rule and have urged its replacement by an implied warranty of habitability. Quite recently, a rapidly increasing number of jurisdictions have reexamined this much-disliked common-law rule and have overturned it in favor of one which provides that in every urban residential lease agreement there is an implied warranty that the rented premises are habitable. Because the implied warranty of habitability is in its initial stages of development, its parameters have yet to be determined by the courts. In Foisy v. Wyman, the Washington Supreme Court joined this growing group of minority jurisdictions in overturning its common-law rule and implying a warranty of habitability in lease agreements. Foisy raises an important new aspect of this developing doctrine. Specifically, does a tenant waive the protection of an implied warranty of habitability where he accepts premises containing substantial <b>patent</b> <b>defects,</b> and where he does so in return for a reduced monthly rent payment?

40|$|Since ancient times, legal {{scholars}} have explored the vexing {{question of when}} and what a contracting party must disclose to her counterparty, {{even in the absence}} of explicit misleading statements. This fascination has culminated in a set of claims regarding which factors drive courts to impose disclosure duties on informed parties. Most of these claims are based on analysis of a small number of non-randomly selected cases and have not been tested systematically. This article represents the first attempt to systematically test a number of these claims using data coded from 466 case decisions spanning over a wide array of jurisdictions and covering over 200 years. The results are mixed. In some cases it appears that conventional wisdom is correct. For example, our data support the claim that courts are more likely to require disclosure of latent, as opposed to <b>patent,</b> <b>defects.</b> In addition, courts are more likely to require full disclosure between parties in a fiduciary or confidential relationship. On the other hand, our results cast doubt on much of the conventional wisdom regarding the law of fraudulent silence. Indeed, our results challenge ten of the most prominent theories that have been asserted to explain when courts will require disclosure. We find that courts are no more likely to impose disclosure duties when the information is casually acquired as opposed to deliberately acquired and that unequal access to information by the contracting parties is not a significant factor that drives courts to require disclosure. We do find, however, that when these two factors are present simultaneously courts are significantly more likely to force disclosure. Perhaps most interestingly, although it is generally understood that courts have become more likely to impose disclosure duties over time, we find that courts actually have become less likely to require disclosure over time...|$|R

If we seek to justify our past, or if we long to return, we can like Lot 2 ̆ 7 s wife be turned to a pillar of salt {{standing}} helpless on the desert. Our backward glance is deadening unless we look through the past to see guidelines for the future. Our appraisal must be more than a judgment of whether the Act has succeeded or failed it must give us wisdom to go forward. It should give us greater insight as to future steps in the development of labor law. The Act has remained substantially unchanged for ten years. This does not prove its validity, but may only demonstrate the obstacles to legislating in the field of labor-management relations. Certain defects in the statute and the need for clarifying or corrective legislation have been painfully obvious. The thicket of words in Section 8 (d) which purports to define the duty to bargain has baffled the Board and the courts for ten years; the latent vacuity of Section 301, which allows suits for breach of contracts, was laid bare by the Supreme Court in the Westinghouse case; the disruptive impact of the closed shop provisions on the building trades has been uniformly recognized; the wishful optimism of the cession clause in Section 10 (a) produced a foreboding fear of a 2 ̆ 2 no-man 2 ̆ 7 s land 2 ̆ 2 between federal and state power, and now the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s barbed wire entanglements have made that fear a reality.

40|$|The {{author of}} the given article refers to the data taken by him from German sources which specify that {{teachers}} of German universities quite often carry out their functional duties according to sufficiently erroneous ideas about the basic psychological, didactic and social preconditions of teaching. Some of them don’t even have any ideas about these preconditions. The very presence of professional didactic qualifications is considered as an obligatory condition for an assignment to the post of a professor assistant or a professor. However the lecturers are not seriously verified {{for the presence of}} methodical and pedagogical competences as preconditions for their participation in competition on taking corresponding academic posts. As the author notices, such kind of neglect of forming and developing psychological and pedagogical qualifications of teachers speaks not only about the tradition which has taken roots in this sphere, but also about the actual professional socialization conditions of young scientists. Systematic education in the field of the higher school didactics practically is not stipulated by the program of their vocational training and occurs under conditions of daily practice. Under these conditions young teachers begin the teaching activity, constantly experiencing psychological uncertainty in their didactic qualifications and feeling a constant shortage or a full absence of didactic methods and ways of their application. The choice of didactic methods and receptions is carried out by assistants intuitively {{on the basis of their}} student's experience. Besides these methods correspond with the social form of frontal lessons, which are traditional for German higher schools. Popularity of these methods speaks, apparently, that their using by beginners does not demand an enough high level of the social and didactic competences and assumes use of own special competence. That fact is obvious, that such state of affairs is absolutely not adequate to professional teacher work at the present stage of developing and reforming the German higher education sphere. Traditional sights at universities on didactical preparation of teachers prevent improvement of the given situation. <b>Patent</b> <b>defects</b> of vocational teacher training provokes on the part of students open criticism of training methods at German higher schools...|$|R
