50|$|<b>Particle</b> <b>board</b> <b>is</b> <b>manufactured</b> {{from wood}} chips, sawmill shavings, or even sawdust, and a {{synthetic}} resin or other suitable binder, which is pressed and extruded. Oriented strand board, {{also known as}} flakeboard, waferboard, or chipboard, is similar but uses machined wood flakes offering more strength. Particle board is cheaper, denser and more uniform than conventional wood and plywood and is substituted for them when cost {{is more important than}} strength and appearance. A major disadvantage of particleboard is that it is very prone to expansion and discoloration due to moisture, particularly when it is not covered with paint or another sealer.|$|E
40|$|The {{result of}} {{a study on the}} {{properties}} of <b>particle</b> <b>board</b> made from pine wood is reported in this paper. The pine as raw material was classified into three groups i. e. tapped, untapped, and combination of them. The <b>particle</b> <b>board</b> <b>was</b> <b>manufactured</b> by using urea formaldehyde resin with four levels i. e. 6 %, 8 %, 10 %, and 12 % by weight of wood dry basis. The result reveals that the average density of <b>particle</b> <b>board</b> made of tapped, untapped, and combination of them is 0. 61 g/cm 3, {{so that it can be}} classified as medium density <b>particle</b> <b>board.</b> The properties of <b>particle</b> <b>board</b> <b>were</b> affected by both tapping and glue proportion. However, density and internal bond were affected by glue proportion but not by the raw material.

40|$|Tannin-containing {{extracts}} of spruce bark {{were produced}} using water, urea solution and sulphite liquor as extraction agents. The extracts of spruce bark {{were used as}} partial substitute for quebracho tannin. <b>Particle</b> <b>boards</b> <b>were</b> <b>manufactured</b> with a binder made of quebracho tannin combined with the hot water extract of the spruce bark or a mixture of spruce bark extract/lingin (extract portion: up to 40 %) and formaldehyde as hardener 10, 5 % of formaldehyde related to tannin and tannin/extract respectively). The strength of these <b>particle</b> <b>boards</b> corresponds {{to the requirements of}} the board type V 100 (bonding resistant to high air humidity).

50|$|Cement <b>boards</b> <b>are</b> mainly cement bonded <b>particle</b> <b>boards</b> {{and cement}} fibre. Cement bonded <b>particle</b> <b>boards</b> have treated wood flakes as reinforcement, whereas in cement fibre boards have {{cellulose}} fibre, {{which is a}} plant extract as reinforcement. Cement acts as binder in both the cases. The fire resistance properties of cement bonded blue <b>particle</b> <b>boards</b> and cement fibre <b>boards</b> <b>are</b> the same. In terms of load-bearing capacity, cement-bonded <b>particle</b> <b>boards</b> have higher capacity than cement fibre <b>boards.</b> Cement <b>particle</b> <b>boards</b> can <b>be</b> <b>manufactured</b> from 6 mm to 40 mm thickness making it ideally suitable for high load bearing applications.These <b>boards</b> <b>are</b> made of a homogeneous mixture and hence are formed as single layer for any thickness.Cement fibre <b>boards</b> <b>are</b> more used in decorative applications and can <b>be</b> <b>manufactured</b> from 3 mm to 20 mm thickness. Fibre <b>boards</b> <b>are</b> made in very thin layers, making it extremely difficult to manufacture high thickness boards. Many manufacturers use additives like mica, aluminium stearate and cenospheres {{in order to achieve}} certain board qualities. Typical cement fiber <b>board</b> <b>is</b> made of approximately 40-60% of cement, 20-30% of fillers, 8-10% of cellulose, 10-15% of mica. Other additives like above mentioned aluminium stearate and PVA are normally used in quantities less than 1%. Cenospheres are used only in low density boards with quantities between 10-15%.

To utilize <b>particle</b> <b>boards</b> with appropriate compaction ratio, study should be conducted to know the influence of compaction ratio on the <b>particle</b> <b>board</b> characteristics of two wood species namely teak and sengon, and the research result {{could be used as a}} base of the assessment to <b>particle</b> <b>board</b> for building. The preliminary test was done to know the density of teak and sengon wood. This study used teak and sengon wood particles with 10 % by weight of particle urea formaldehyde adhesive UA- 147. This study was arranged in the completely randomised design with factorial experiment. The factors in this experiment were compaction ratio and wood species, while the parameters which observed were density, water content, water absorption, thickness swelling, internal bonding, hardness, MOE, and MOR. The research result showed that the higher compaction ratio, the higher density, internal bonding, hardness, MOR and MOE of both species <b>particle</b> <b>board,</b> the higher thickness swelling, and the lower water absorption of sengon <b>particle</b> <b>board.</b> The highest average density of the teak <b>particle</b> <b>board</b> <b>was</b> 0, 80 g/cm 3 (J 1 K 3) and 0, 67 g/cm 3 for sengon (J 2 K 6). The highest average internal bonding of the teak <b>particle</b> <b>board</b> <b>was</b> 5, 20 kg/cm 2 (J 1 K 3) and 5, 85 kg/cm 2 for sengon (J 2 K 6).

The highest average MOR of the teak <b>particle</b> <b>board</b> <b>was</b> 145, 9 kg/cm 2 (J 1 K 3) and 162, 7 kg/cm 2 for sengon (J 2 K 6). The highest average thickness swelling of the sengon <b>particle</b> <b>board</b> <b>was</b> 30, 76 % (J 2 K 4) and 11, 84 % the lowest (J 2 K 3). The highest average MOE of the sengon <b>particle</b> <b>board</b> <b>was</b> 18605, 45 kg/cm 2 (J 2 K 6) and 22580, 41 kg/cm 2 for the teak (J 1 K 3).

40|$|A {{series of}} {{machining}} experiments on the Oil Palm Empty-Fruit Bunch (OPEFB) <b>particle</b> <b>board</b> <b>were</b> carried out using tungsten carbide tools, {{to ascertain the}} predominant mechanism of tool wear when machining this material. The experiments were carried out using a high speed lathe, which machined a rotating disc of the OPEFB <b>particle</b> <b>board.</b> It <b>was</b> found that mechanical abrasion and micro-fracture was the primary mode of tool failure when machining OPEFB <b>particle</b> <b>board.</b> The low cutting temperature recorded during the machining experiments provides compelling evidence to eliminate any significant effect of electrochemical and oxidation mechanisms on the wear of tungsten carbide tools. Therefore, the wear of cemented tungsten carbide tools when machining OPEFB <b>particle</b> <b>board</b> <b>was</b> predominantly by mechanical wear mechanisms.

The research result indicates that the higher the adhesive composition (either adhesives of acacia bark or gambier), <b>particle</b> <b>board</b> resulted <b>is</b> better. In dry condition,  values of the tensile strength of particle boards  that have acacia bark adhesive and gambier adhesive have range of 84. 2 - 104 Kgf/cm 2 and 83. 4 - 81. 5 kg/cm 2, respectively.
