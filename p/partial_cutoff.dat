40|$|This {{research}} has addressed typical geological complexities through performance evaluation of selective foundation seepage control features for embankment dams on deep permeable strata. The study {{is based on}} an intricate case history of Satpara Dam Project founded over moraines. Seepage control measures for Satpara dam foundations included upstream extension of the dam core as an impervious blanket with a <b>partial</b> <b>cutoff</b> at its upstream end. Seepage modelling was carried for â€˜as-designedâ€™ seepage mitigation measures under 2 -D sectional flow model assumptions for different case scenarios using SEEP/W. In-situ permeability test results from pre-construction exploratory investigations of the project, ranging over several logarithmic orders of magnitude, were scrutinised for identification of a representative dataset for assignment of Kvalues while characterising spatial variability. Relative seepage sensitivity analyses were made using â€˜percentileâ€™ values from the two-layered â€˜pervious zone in homogeneousâ€™ foundation representation approach and computed values from the multi-zoned â€˜ROCKWORKS modelledâ€™ multi-zoned foundation representation approach. Comparative inferences considered theoretically acceptable limits in averting piping initiation for the adopted seepage control measures. The refinement in K-assumptions from the layered to the multi-zoned approach influenced and enhanced scale of magnitudes and rate of change of computed gradients and hydraulic heads along their distributions and trends at different points of consideration along the flow direction. The adopted seepage control scheme reduced the computed hydraulic gradients to 73. 5 % and the head potential to 72 % at toe of core relative to no seepage control measures. Available project data from five years of consecutive operation (for five impoundings during 2007 - 2011) showed that conservation level and consequently a steady state condition was not achieved. Effectiveness of the adopted seepage control measures at Satpara Dam was evaluated through comparative response of instruments installed across the cutoff wall, for upstream and downstream observations at two different depth zones, and along the flow path in the foundations upstream and downstream of the main dam axis. Piezometeric data from 27 selected responsive foundation piezometers covering the project area was used to develop percent potential contour plot plans, corresponding to selected pseudo-steady state reservoir levels and for a reservoir level common to the last three impounding stages. Evaluation of head differentials and percent potential distributions also provided evidence of cross flow influences, indicating 3 -D flow in the dam foundation domain. Pseudo-steady state reservoir levels defined new loading conditions, which were used to extend the 2 -D â€˜as designedâ€™ SEEP/W model and additionally simulate a 3 -D seepage model using FEFLOW. Simulated results based on the multi-zoned preconstruction foundation representation could not replicate the observed â€˜pseudosteadyâ€™ foundation response. It was assessed that applied heads had likely caused redistribution of unsupported fines, at probable locations associated with higher potential drops and concentrated potential contours. The cutoff wall proximity and foundations underlying the drainage blanket were accordingly identified to induce higher gradients susceptible for subsequently dislodging fines. An inverse 2 -D modelling approach was implied to correspondingly re-adjust K-values in the sectional multi-zoned pre-construction foundation representation. This helped improve related subsurface perceptions of post-construction foundation behaviour...|$|E

40|$|Our previously-developed calculational method (the <b>partial</b> wave <b>cutoff</b> method) is {{employed}} to evaluate explicitly scalar one-loop effective actions {{in a class}} of radially symmetric background gauge fields. Our method proves to be particularly effective when it is used in conjunction with a systematic WKB series for the large partial wave contribution to the effective action.

40|$|Recently the <b>partial</b> wave <b>cutoff</b> {{method was}} {{developed}} as a new calculational scheme for a functional determinant of quantum field theory in radial backgrounds. For the contribution given by an infinite sum of large partial waves, we derive explicitly radial WKB series in the angular momentum cutoff for $d= 2, 3, 4 $ and 5 ($d$ is the spacetime dimension), which has uniform validity irrespectively of any specific values assumed for other parameters. Utilizing this series, precision evaluation of the renormalized functional determinant is possible with {{a relatively small number}} of low partial wave contributions determined separately. We illustrate the power of this scheme in numerically exact evaluation of the prefactor (expressed as a functional determinant) in the case of the false vacuum decay of 4 D scalar field theory.

40|$|Abstract 4 U 1822 - 371 is {{a typical}} edge-on eclipsing low mass X-ray binary and the {{prototype}} of accretion disk coronal sources. We report {{on the results of}} a spectral anal-ysis over the energy range 0. 5 – 45 keV observed by Suzaku in 2006. We extract spectra from five orbital phases. The spectra can be equally well described by various previously proposed models: an optically thick model described by a <b>partial</b> covering <b>cutoff</b> power-law and an optically thin model described by a blackbody plus a cutoff powerlaw. The optically thick model requires a covering fraction of about 55 %, while the optically thin model requires a temperature of the central source of about 0. 16 keV. The spectrum in optically thick model also shows the previously detected cyclotron line feature at ∼ 30 keV (Sasano et al., 2014) with the same Suzaku observation. This feature confirms the presence of a strong magnetic field. The Fe Kα fluorescence line strengths as well as the detected Fe XXVI strengths are similar to previous Chandra andXMM-Newton detections in our phased spectra analysis; however, we also observe strong Fe XXVI during eclipse, which indicates a slightly larger central corona...|$|R
40|$|Our recent {{method to}} {{calculate}} renormalized functional determinants, the <b>partial</b> wave <b>cutoff</b> method, is extended {{for the evaluation}} of 4 -D fermion one-loop effective action with arbitrary mass in certain types of radially symmetric, non-Abelian, background gauge fields (including instanton-like and instanton-antiinstanton-like configurations). A detailed study on functional determinants for matrix-valued radial differential operators is presented, explicating both our analytic treatment on the high partial wave contribution and the application of the generalized Gel'fand-Yaglom formula to determine the low partial wave contribution. In general, some numerical work is needed for the low partial wave part. In the massless limit, however, the factorizable nature of our partial-wave radial differential operators can be exploited to evaluate semi-analytically even the low partial wave part, and we thus have the full fermion effective action calculated explicitly in a class of non-Abelian background gauge fields. With nonzero mass, we also perform necessary numerical analysis as regards the low partial wave contribution to produce numerically exact results for the massive effective action. Comparing these against the results of the large mass expansion, the validity range of the large mass expansion is addressed. Also studied is the fermion mass dependence of the effective instanton-antiinstanton interaction. Comment: 50 pages, 11 figures, revtex, fig 10 replace...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} timing and {{broad-band}} pulse phase resolved spectral {{analysis of the}} transient Be X-ray binary pulsar 1 A 1118 - 61 observed during its outburst in January 2009 using Suzaku observations. Suzaku observations were made twice, once {{at the peak of}} the outburst, and once 13 days later at its declining phase. Pulse profiles from both observations exhibit strong energy dependence with several peaks at low energies and a single peak above ~ 10 keV. A weak, narrow peak is detected at the main dip of the pulse profiles from both observations in the energy bands below 3 keV, indicating the presence of a phase dependent soft excess in the source continuum. The broad-band energy spectrum of the pulsar could be fitted well with a <b>partial</b> covering <b>cutoff</b> power-law model and a narrow iron fluorescence line. We also detect a broad cyclotron feature at ~ 50 keV from both observations which is a feature common for accretion powered pulsars with high magnetic field strengths. Pulse phase-resolved spectral analysis shows an increase in the absorption column density of the partial covering component, as well as variation in the covering fraction at the dips of the pulse profiles, that naturally explains the energy dependence of the same. The cyclotron line parameters also show significant variation with pulse phase with a ~ 10 keV variation in the cyclotron line energy and a variation in depth by a factor of three. This can be explained either as the effect of different viewing angles of the dipole field at different pulse phases, or a more complex underlying magnetic field geometryComment: 22 pages, 9 figures and 1 table.

We present a detailed pulse-phase-resolved spectral analysis of the persistent high-mass X-ray binary pulsar Vela X- 1 observed with Suzaku during 2008 June. The pulse profiles exhibit both intensity and energy dependence with multiple peaks at low energies and double peaks at higher energies. The source shows some spectral evolution over {{the duration of the}} observation and care has been taken to average over data with minimum spectral variability for the analysis. We model the continuum with a phenomenological <b>partial</b> covering high-energy <b>cutoff</b> model and a more physical partial covering thermal Comptonization model (CompTT) excluding the time ranges having variable hardness ratio and intensity dependence. For both the models, we detect a cyclotron resonant scattering feature (CRSF) and its harmonic at ~ 25 keV and ~ 50 keV. Both the CRSF fundamental and harmonics parameters are strongly variable over the pulse phase, with the ratio of the two line energies deviating from the classical value of 2. The continuum parameters also show significant variation over the pulse phase and give us some idea about the changing physical conditions that are seen with the changing viewing angle at different pulse phases and obscuration by the accretion stream at some pulse phases...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{four new}} hybrid digital circuit design techniques, namely, hybrid multi-threshold CMOS {{complete}} stack technique, hybrid multi-threshold CMOS partial stack technique, hybrid super cutoff complete stack technique and hy-brid super <b>cutoff</b> <b>partial</b> stack technique, {{have been proposed}} to reduce the subthreshold leakage power dissipation in standby modes. Techniques available in literature are compared with our proposed hybrid circuit design techniques. Performance parameters such as subthreshold leakage power dissipation in active and standby modes, dynamic power dissipation and propagation delay, are compared using existing and proposed hybrid techniques for a two input AND gate. Reduction of subthreshold leakage power dissipation in standby mode is given more importance, {{in comparison with the}} other circuit design performance parameters. It is found that there is reduction in subthreshold leakage power dissipation in standby and active modes by 3. 5 × and 1. 15 × respectively using the proposed hybrid super cutoff com-plete stack technique as compared to the existing multi-threshold CMOS (MTCMOS) technique. Also a saving of 2. 50 × and 1. 04 × in subthreshold leakage power dissipation in standby and active modes respectively were observed using hybrid super cutoff complete stack technique as compared to the existing super cutoff CMOS (SCCMOS) technique. The proposed hybrid super cutoff stack technique proved to perform better in terms of subthreshold leakage power dis-sipation in standby mode in comparison with other techniques.

40|$|What {{should an}} {{adequate}} representation of individuals (elements of {{the domain of}} discourse) be like, within vagueness models with degrees? This paper explores the hypothesis that individuals are distinguished by their property values, i. e. the extents to which they satisfy gradable properties. First, as Lewis (1986) argues, cross-world identity is intuitively implausible between individuals differing in their property values, e. g., their height, weight, etc. ('intrinsic properties'). However, cross-world identity is intuitively plausible between individuals sharing the same property values (the same heights, weights, etc.), even if they differ along extrinsic, relational properties, e. g., if they are considered 'tall' in one world, but not in another, due to variance in the cutoff point of tall across the two worlds. A representation of individuals by their property values captures the intuitively sharp distinction between these two cases. Second, this proposal captures the intuitive difference between cases we tend to call 'ignorance' and cases we tend to call 'vagueness' (for Williamson 1994, cases of 'accidental' versus cases of 'inherent' ignorance), which are usually modeled with the same formal means. While vagueness/inherent ignorance (about the truth value of statements like Dan is tall) arises due to <b>partial</b> information regarding <b>cutoff</b> points of vague predicates like tall, accidental ignorance (say, about the truth value of statements like Dan is two meters tall or Dan is taller than Sam) arises due to partial information regarding property values (e. g., the height) of referents of arguments like Dan ('discourse entities'). A representation of individuals by their property values, then, captures the intuitive distinctions between both phenomena...|$|R

An open-access {{version is}} {{available}} at arXiv. org (one of the alternative locations) Articles older than 2 years are open to all at the journal siteWe present results from a study of broadband timing and spectral properties of EXO 2030 + 375 using a Suzaku observation. Pulsations with a period of 41. 41 s and strong energy-dependent pulse profiles were clearly detected up to 100 keV. Narrow dips are seen in the profiles up to ~ 70 keV. The presence of prominent dips at several phases in the profiles up to such high energy ranges was not seen before. At higher energies, these dips gradually disappeared and the profile appeared to be single-peaked. The 1. 0 - 200. 0 keV broadband spectrum {{is found to be}} well described by a <b>partial</b> covering high-energy <b>cutoff</b> power-law model. Several low-energy emission lines are also detected in the pulsar spectrum. We fitted the spectrum using neutral as well as partially ionized absorbers along with the above continuum model yielding similar parameter values. The partial covering with a partially ionized absorber resulted in a marginally better fit. The spectral fitting did not require any cyclotron feature in the best-fit model. To investigate the changes in spectral parameters at dips, we carried out pulse-phase-resolved spectroscopy. During the dips, the value of the additional column density was estimated to be high compared to other pulse phases. While using a partially ionized absorber, the value of the ionization parameter is also higher at the dips. This may be the reason for the presence of dips up to higher energies. No other spectral parameters show any systematic variation with pulse phases of the pulsar...|$|R
