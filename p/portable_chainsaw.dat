50|$|Festool is a {{brand of}} power tools from Germany. Festool Group GmbH & Co. KG is based in Wendlingen and is a {{subsidiary}} of the TTS Tooltechnic Systems holding company. The company was founded by Gottlieb Stoll and Albert Fezer in 1925 under the name Fezer & Stoll and then later became Festo. Innovations included the first gasoline powered <b>portable</b> <b>chainsaw</b> , the orbital sander, the portable circular saw with guide rail (called a track saw), and the Domino joiner. In 2000, its portable power tool activities were spun off into an independent company, Festool.|$|E
50|$|Forestry {{mechanization}} {{was always}} in close connection to metal working {{and the development of}} mechanical tools to cut and transport timber to its destination. Rafting belongs to the earliest means of transport. Steel saws came up in the 15th century. The 19th century widely increased the availability of steel for whipsaws and introduced Forest railways and railways in general for transport and as forestry customer. Further human induced changes, however, came since World War II, respectively in line with the '1950s-syndrome'. The first <b>portable</b> <b>chainsaw</b> was invented in 1918 in Canada, but large impact of mechanization in forestry started after World War II. Forestry harvesters are among the most recent developments. Although drones, planes, laser scanning, satellites and robots also play a part in forestry.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{patent for}} a practical [...] "endless chain saw" [...] (a saw comprising {{a chain of}} links carrying saw teeth and running in a guide frame) was granted to Samuel J. Bens of San Francisco on January 17, 1905. His intent being to fell giant redwoods. The first <b>portable</b> <b>chainsaw</b> was developed and patented in 1918 by Canadian millwright James Shand. After he allowed his rights to lapse in 1930 his invention was further developed by what became the German company Festo in 1933. The company now operates as Festool producing portable power tools. Other important contributors to the modern chainsaw are Joseph Buford Cox and Andreas Stihl; the latter patented and developed an electrical chainsaw for use on bucking sites in 1926 and a gasoline-powered chainsaw in 1929, and founded a company to mass-produce them. In 1927, Emil Lerp, the founder of Dolmar, developed the world's first gasoline-powered chainsaw and mass-produced them.|$|E

5000|$|Makita Engineering Germany GmbH (Dolmar) {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{manufacturers}} of <b>portable</b> gasoline <b>chainsaws</b> and is headquartered in Hamburg, Germany. The company founder, Emil Lerp, developed in 1927 the [...] "type A" [...] saw, which weighed 125 lb and required two men to operate. It was tested on Mount Dolmar in the Thüringer forest and the company took its name from the test site.|$|R
50|$|Festo {{was founded}} in 1925 by Albert Fezer and Gottlieb Stoll. Initially, the company {{manufactured}} wood cutting tools and later diversified into the automation industry. A noteworthy early product was the first <b>portable,</b> gasoline-powered <b>chainsaw.</b> In 2000, its portable power tool activities were spun off into an independent company, Festool. In 2002, Festo went to the United States Supreme Court to defend a change to a patent application in Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co...|$|R
40|$|<b>Portable</b> <b>chainsaw</b> {{is a basic}} {{operational}} instrument in forestry. To ensure long-lasting performance of a chainsaw, {{it is necessary to}} perform the necessary maintenance of its cutting system. The basis of this maintenance lies in the lubrication of the chain, which protects it from excessive wearing and deterioration. Various lubricating oils are used for lubricating the chain. Biodegradable oils are promoted nowadays, with their main advantage being shorter decomposition time in the environment, and the same lubricating properties as conventional lubricants. This paper is aimed to evaluate and compare the ability to lubricate and cool the cutting system of a <b>portable</b> <b>chainsaw</b> filled with biodegradable oil and oils commonly used for its operation. Conditions of measurements were specified to simulate the actual operating conditions. During the evaluation no major differences between these oils were observed...|$|E
40|$|Oil {{palm trees}} wood {{are no longer}} {{productive}} after 25 year old, and will be cut down {{in the form of}} wooden logs. Wooden logs of oil palm are left piled on the land and into the waste oil palm trunk, so the need for a study on the design of the portable sawing machine to cultivate oil palm logs into sawn timber. This study aimed to obtain design parameters, the design of the <b>portable</b> <b>chainsaw,</b> and the application of appropriate technology. The method used in this study is that, in the selection of the design can be obtained by using software engineering drawings and researchers will choose a design with DFMA methods. The design process is conducted in 5 stages by identifying design flaws and fix them to get the best design, after the design is obtained then calculated the total assembly time using a table of manual handling time, and table of manual insertiontime is calculated, and the efficiency of assembly is also calculated. Results from this study is a final design sawing machinesawn timbermaker of portable oil palm trunks which has 2 working principle is to use thrustforce and using crank torque as the driving force. The total value is 295, 2 seconds assembly time and the efficiency of the assembly 4, 06 %. It can be concluded that the design obtained has an easy manufacturing and assembling process...|$|E
50|$|Many {{motorized}} lawn mowers, <b>chainsaws,</b> <b>portable</b> generators, {{and portable}} outboard motors use a pullstring or pullcord {{attached to a}} handle as a manual ignition device. Some vehicle engines are also started with pullchains, such as the early-1900s Puckridge, or pullcords, like the pre-release version of the Citroën 2CV car, and the DKW RT 125 scooter.|$|R
50|$|Rip {{cuts are}} {{commonly}} {{made with a}} table saw, but other types of power saws can also be used, including a radial arm saw, band saw, and hand held circular saw. In sawmills the head saw is the first rip-saw a log goes through, which is sometimes a gang-saw, and then the cants may be resawn using other saws and then edged in a edger and sometimes cut to length by a crosscut saw. Also, smaller <b>portable</b> sawmills and <b>chainsaw</b> mills use rip-cuts to produce lumber. Each time {{a piece of wood}} is rip cut it takes time and the kerf material turns into sawdust and loses value so the number and width of each rip cut influence the economics of the operation: This gives band saws an advantage over circular saws and chainsaws.|$|R
40|$|Various {{forms of}} {{portable}} or 'walkabout' sawmills have become popular for timber extraction and in-forest milling in tropical forestry in recent years. A number of advantages over larger fixed-site mills have been recognised, such as reduced transport costs and utilisation of smaller logs and branches. Portable bandsaws, {{with a thin}} blade kerf generally {{give rise to a}} greater timber recovery than traditional circular saws. Chainsaws have been criticised for greater timber wastage, and in some cases their use for timber extraction has been declared illegal. The choice of appropriate technology involves a tradeoff with respect to various factors including capital outlays, maintenance capability and costs, labour efficiency and timber recovery rate. If these items are factored into the overall average cost curve, it becomes apparent that both <b>portable</b> sawmills and <b>chainsaw</b> milling do have an important role in tropical small-scale forestry. the latter are particularly useful for flitch cutting as a first stage of milling...|$|R
