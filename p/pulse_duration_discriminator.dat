Design A repeated-measures design with 4 stimuli presented in random order {{was used to test}} 25 women: (1) 500 -microsecond <b>pulse</b> <b>duration,</b> (2) 250 -microsecond <b>pulse</b> <b>duration,</b> (3) 500 -microsecond <b>pulse</b> <b>duration</b> and low carrier frequency (1 kHz), (4) 250 -microsecond <b>pulse</b> <b>duration</b> and high carrier frequency (4 kHz). Isometric peak torque of quadriceps muscle was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer. Discomfort was measured using a visual analog scale. Results Currents with long <b>pulse</b> <b>durations</b> induced approximately 21 % higher evoked torque than short <b>pulse</b> <b>durations.</b> In addition, currents with 500 microseconds delivered greater amounts of charge than stimulation patterns using 250 -microsecond <b>pulse</b> <b>durations</b> (P < 0. 05). All currents presented similar discomfort. There was no difference on stimulation efficiency with the same <b>pulse</b> <b>duration.</b> Conclusions Both kilohertz frequency alternating current and pulsed current, with the same <b>pulse</b> <b>duration,</b> have similar efficiency for inducing isometric knee extension torque and discomfort. However, neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) with longer <b>pulse</b> <b>duration</b> induces higher NMES-evoked torque, regardless of the carrier frequency. <b>Pulse</b> <b>duration</b> is an important variable that should receive more attention for an optimal application of NMES in clinical settings...|$|R

We study {{the effects of}} <b>pulse</b> <b>duration,</b> radiant exposure, and cryogen spray cooling (CSC) on the thermal response of skin, using a Monte Carlo based optical-thermal model. Thermal injury to the epidermis decreases with increasing <b>pulse</b> <b>duration</b> during irradiation at a constant radiant exposure; however, maintaining vascular injury requires that the radiant exposure also increase. At short <b>pulse</b> <b>durations,</b> only a minimal increase in radiant exposure is necessary for a therapeutic effect to be achieved because thermal diffusion from the vessels is minimal. However, at longer <b>pulse</b> <b>durations</b> the radiant exposure must be greatly increased. There exists an optimum <b>pulse</b> <b>duration</b> at which minimal damage to the epidermis and significant injury within the targeted vasculature occur. For example, the model predicts optimum <b>pulse</b> <b>durations</b> of approximately 1. 5, 6, and 20 ms for vessel diameters of 40, 80, and 120 μm, respectively.

Based on the performed experiments, three different ionization mechanisms depending on the <b>pulse</b> <b>duration</b> were identified. For <b>pulse</b> <b>durations</b> in the sub- 50 fs domain, the ionization mechanism is direct multiphoton ionization shown by clear observation of an ATI structure in the photoelectron spectra.

For protection against these lesions, knowledge of rotational acceleration tolerance levels in humans is required.
