25|$|In this way, {{a series}} of <b>ploughing</b> <b>runs</b> down a field leaves a row of sods that lie partly in the furrows and partly on the ground lifted earlier. Visually, across the rows, there is the land (unploughed part) on the left, a furrow (half {{the width of the}} removed strip of soil) and the removed strip almost {{upside-down}} lying on about half of the previous strip of inverted soil, and so on across the field. Each layer of soil and the gutter it came from forms the classic furrow.|$|R
50|$|The {{operation}} of the line has been rented out since 1998 for 15 years to the Bayerische Oberlandbahn (BOB), that previously had the state concession for the {{operation of}} railway services in the Bavarian Oberland. The BOB has continued to use the railway infrastructure of the Tegernsee-Bahn. The running and rolling stock was given up by the Tegernsee-Bahn in 1999 as they no longer needed it. Since 2002 the TBG has once again had its own locomotive, the TAG 15. This former DB Class Köf III is used for snow <b>plough</b> <b>runs</b> and construction train work.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} public houses in Fen Ditton. The <b>Plough</b> <b>runs</b> {{down to the}} river at Green End; The Ancient Shepherds on the High Street was built as three cottages in 1540; The King's Head, active since at least 1760, is {{situated}} alongside the church. Former pubs include The Sluice or Pike and Eel, {{to the north of the}} village on the river; The Harvest home on Green End; and The Blue Lion, rebuilt in 1951, where the High Street meets the Horningsea Road, which closed in March 2012 to allow the site to be redeveloped as housing.|$|R

This, {{after two or three}} failures, he accomplished. Then, with less than his usual judgment, he put his two chariot horses to the <b>plough,</b> and <b>ran</b> a great risk of spoiling them, in giving his new invention a trial over ground thickly swarded.|$|R
60|$|It {{had never}} {{recovered}} the heavy fine imposed upon Walpole Crawley, first baronet, for peculation in the Tape and Sealing Wax Office. Sir Walpole was a jolly fellow, eager to seize and {{to spend money}} (alieni appetens, sui profusus, as Mr. Crawley would remark with a sigh), and in his day beloved by all the county for the constant drunkenness and hospitality which was maintained at Queen's Crawley. The cellars were filled with burgundy then, the kennels with hounds, and the stables with gallant hunters; now, such horses as Queen's Crawley possessed went to <b>plough,</b> or <b>ran</b> in the Trafalgar Coach; and {{it was with a}} team of these very horses, on an off-day, that Miss Sharp was brought to the Hall; for boor as he was, Sir Pitt was a stickler for his dignity while at home, and seldom drove out but with four horses, and though he dined off boiled mutton, had always three footmen to serve it.|$|R
5000|$|The crann-nan-gad was {{a type of}} plough {{formerly}} used in the Western Isles of Scotland. It was one of {{the earliest}} types of plough used in Hebridean crofting, and consisted of a small crooked piece of wood with an iron tip at one end and a top-mounted handle or stilt (thus, a single-stilted plough). Its curving coulter and sock were both made of iron. It could be drawn by up to four horses, although one or two were more usual. The design of the crann-nan-gad was specifically related to the environmental conditions of Hebridean farms, facilitating paring and skimming of the shallow soil. The <b>plough's</b> tip could <b>run</b> along the ground, which enabled its user to lift it over large stones embedded in the earth.|$|R
50|$|In 1958 the National Ploughing Association (NPA) {{appointed}} Sean O'Farrell as Managing Director {{to harness}} its already evident future potential, and {{to lay the}} foundations for the future. NPA, {{a member of the}} World <b>Ploughing</b> Association, <b>runs</b> the National <b>Ploughing</b> Championships, and now claimed by NPA to be the largest Outdoor Show in Europe 2016. He was one of only three MD's in its 84-year history, where he recorded a number of notable achievements. A national bread baking competition was introduced by NPA in co-operation with ESB in 1958 and continues to this day. In 1959 he represented the NPA at the 7th World Ploughing Contest to Armoy, County Antrim, Northern Ireland and the first time held there. He honoured his county by ‘bringing home’ the NPA Championships on three occasions - to Burnchurch, County Kilkenny, in 1959 and returned to Danesfort, Co Kilkenny in 1964 and again for a third time in 1970. He attended the 8th World Ploughing Contest in Tor Mancina, Roma, Italy 1960 where he proudly presented a distinctive block of his native Kilkenny Marble as Ireland's contribution to Rome's 'Cairn of Peace' in 1960. A highlight of his tenure was when representing Ireland at 9th World Ploughing Contest, Grignon, Paris, France in 1961 where, in his role of MD of NPA and representing Ireland, was officially introduced to the President of France, Charles de Gaulle.|$|R
60|$|Round {{three-fourths of}} the horizon the {{bleached}} prairie, tinged now with sunny ochre, melted into the sweep of lustrous blue, but in the foreground the sod was gemmed with little crocus-like flowers and already flecked here and there with creeping green. All this was waste and virgin, but on the fourth side tall bands of golden stubble, and belts of ashes where golden stubble had once been, were narrowed down by the steaming chocolate-tinted clods of the <b>plough's</b> upturning. Grain <b>ran</b> up in long rippled ridges from Prospect, where the birches gleamed silver, across the wide dip of basin and over its fringing rise, into the luminous blueness of the sky. That was man's work, and man at Prospect worked unusually hard, for {{it was not his}} part there to plough where others had also sown, but to grapple with the wilderness, and subdue it, in fulfilment of the charge given him when the waters dried. The wilderness was there, leagues of it, but it required a stout heart and a steadfast toil to break it and cover it with red-gold wheat when wheat was a drug upon a falling market.|$|R
60|$|We {{could have}} {{assured him that}} his beat would be answered, and the forces be mustered. Fear not, thou drummer of the night, we too will be there. And still he drummed on in the silence and the dark. This stray sound from a far-off sphere came to our ears from time to time, far, sweet, and significant, and we listened with such an unprejudiced sense {{as if for the}} first time we heard at all. No doubt he was an {{insignificant}} drummer enough, but his music afforded us a prime and leisure hour, and we felt that we were in season wholly. These simple sounds related us to the stars. Ay, there was a logic in them so convincing that the combined sense of mankind could never make me doubt their conclusions. I stop my habitual thinking, as if the <b>plough</b> had suddenly <b>run</b> deeper in its furrow through the crust of the world. How can I go on, who have just stepped over such a bottomless skylight in the bog of my life. Suddenly old Time winked at me,--Ah, you know me, you rogue,--and news had come that IT was well. That ancient universe is in such capital health, I think undoubtedly it will never die. Heal yourselves, doctors; by God, I live.|$|R
40|$|Abstract]: Odour impacts from ‘broiler’ {{farms are}} a major issue facing the Australian meat chicken industry. Urban {{encroachment}} into traditionally rural areas, as well as intensification of the broiler farms in recent times, have exacerbated the problem. This issue is placing poultry producers under increasing pressure to control and reduce odour emissions. At present, there are three main categories which deal with the treatment or mitigation of the odour emissions from broiler sheds: 1. Using dispersion to dilute odour before reaching sensitive receptors; 2. Preventing odours from reaching the outside environment (eg: by using an odour treatment system); and 3. Preventing the production of odours at the source (ie: within the broiler house). Odour dispersion is used as the primary method for preventing odour impacts. When broiler farms are built, appropriate separation distances must be maintained between the farm and neighbours. If large separation distances are required, the costs for purchasing large parcels of land can be significant. Treatment of odour leaving the broiler shed is not currently a viable option due to excessive cost {{and a lack of}} available technology. Perhaps {{the most effective way to}} reduce odour impacts, at reasonable cost, is to prevent the generation of odours at the source, that is, within the broiler house. Aeration of the litter is one technique that may be able to reduce the generation of odours within the broiler house by preventing the formation of anaerobic zones within the litter. Anaerobic zones are believed to be responsible for significant odour generation. The aim of this project is to test the efficacy of an automated plough system to regularly disrupt and aerate the litter. Several plough designs were investigated. Two designs that were investigated in detail were a blade <b>plough,</b> which <b>runs</b> underneath the litter, and a paddlewheel plough, which rotates while moving through the litter and causes significant disturbance of the litter material. Both theoretical systems would be powered by an electric motor installed at one end of the shed connected to a fully reversible winch system to pull the plough through the litter. Each plough system was designed to meet the following requirements: • Ease of operation; • Low maintenance and cleaning requirements; • Minimal impact upon the chickens; • Compliance with workplace heath and safety requirements; • Low infrastructure and operating costs; and • Effective odour reduction. These systems were modeled using the solid modelling package ProEngineer, Wildfire V 2. 0 and engineering analysis was performed on each of the designs. Reduction of odour generation was not assessed during this investigation...|$|R
