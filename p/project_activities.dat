The higher the <b>project</b> <b>activity</b> submission of a project is, the larger developer interest in a project. My paper proposed that applying a Submission Multiple Tier (SMT) matrix can detect the impact of developer interest on <b>project</b> <b>activity.</b> Results showed more volume of OS projects with low <b>project</b> <b>activity</b> than high. Activity submission results also showed that developers are more likely to review than correct projects, with the first priority to find and fix bugs.

40|$|<b>Project</b> <b>activity</b> has a {{long history}} of {{implementation}} in education (Kilpatrick, 1918). This article describes the approach to <b>project</b> <b>activity</b> that became widespread in preschool education in Russia in the late 1990 s. This approach is based on the cultural-historical theory of Vygotsky (1978), Venger’s (1988) understanding of intellectual giftedness, as well as an understanding of <b>project</b> <b>activity</b> proposed by Leontiev (2000). At the heart of <b>project</b> <b>activity</b> lies children’s exploration of the space of possibilities — that is, their search for action options that correspond to their personal motives and express their individuality. The main features of <b>project</b> <b>activity</b> are the problem situation to be presented to the child; the subjectivity of all its participants, including teachers; and its nature, which includes its social context. Three main types of <b>project</b> <b>activity</b> are presented: research, creative, and normative; each has its own structure and value for children’s development. Examples of their implementation in preschool settings are provided. The impact of <b>project</b> <b>activity</b> on all its participants in preschool — children, teachers, parents — is addressed. The article shows the effectiveness of <b>project</b> <b>activity</b> for educational work with both intellectually gifted and normally developing children...|$|R

25|$|The MTA, {{which had}} little {{experience}} in managing an undertaking {{of the scope}} and magnitude of the CA/T Project, hired a joint venture to provide preliminary designs, manage design consultants and construction contractors, track the project's cost and schedule, advise MTA on project decisions, and (in some instances) act as the MTA's representative. Eventually, MTA combined some of its employees with joint venture employees in an integrated project organization. This was intended to make management more efficient, but it hindered MTA's ability to independently oversee <b>project</b> <b>activities</b> because MTA and the joint venture had effectively become partners in the project.|$|E

The scheduled time frame for the study consisted of a working group report in 2007; provided that approval is the outcome of the report, a tender process was to be initiated in 2008; and construction would finish in 2011.

One of the main projects the World Bank is working on to reduce food insecurity in Burkina Faso is the Agricultural Productivity and Food Security Project. According to the World Bank, {{the objective of this}} project is to [...] "improve the capacity of poor producers to increase food production and to ensure improved availability of food products in rural markets." [...] The Agricultural Productivity and Food Security Project has three main parts. Its first component is to work towards the improvement of food production, including financing grants and providing 'voucher for work' programs for households who cannot pay their contribution in cash. The project's next component involves improving the ability of food products, particularly in rural areas. This includes supporting the marketing of food products, and aims to strengthen the capabilities of stakeholders to control the variability of food products and supplies at local and national levels. Lastly, the third component of this project focuses on institutional development and capacity building. Its goal is to reinforce the capacities of service providers and institutions who are specifically involved in project implementation. The project's activities aim to build capacities of service providers, strengthen the capacity of food producer organizations, strengthen agricultural input supply delivery methods, and manage and evaluate <b>project</b> <b>activities.</b>|$|E
