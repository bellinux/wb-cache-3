50|$|The <b>PANOSE</b> Mapper {{software}} {{determines the}} closest possible font match {{on any given}} system by comparing the <b>PANOSE</b> numbers of the requested and available fonts. The individual <b>PANOSE</b> digits are compared, weighted by their typographic importance, and summed to provide a numerical visual distance. Typographic importance is derived by assigning weights to each digit; for example, a font's weight (regular, bold, demibold, etc.) {{is more important than}} its contrast (difference between thick and thin strokes).|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} classification system was {{changed from a}} bucket-based system to an arithmetic system (except the Family from <b>PANOSE</b> 1.0 and derivatives), and was expanded to following categories:Each <b>PANOSE</b> 2.0 category value is a signed 16-bit number (from −32,768 to 32,767; only ranges between −10,000 and 10,000 are defined), where value zero (0) {{is considered to be}} the [...] "normal" [...] for the digit. For example, digit zero for the weight represents medium weight. The [...] "any" [...] value from <b>PANOSE</b> 1.0 is translated to a [...] "don't care" [...] parameter and is replaced by the more comprehensive distortable font descriptions.|$|E
50|$|In 1996, {{during the}} W3C's draft process for CSS1, Hewlett Packard {{proposed}} a <b>PANOSE</b> syntax extension for font substitution.

50|$|Enzymes {{containing}} this domain {{belong to}} family 13 (CAZY GH_13) of the glycosyl hydrolases. The maltogenic alpha-amylase is an enzyme which catalyses hydrolysis of (1-4)-alpha-D-glucosidic linkages in polysaccharides {{so as to}} remove successive alpha-maltose residues from the non-reducing ends of the chains in the conversion of starch to maltose. Other enzymes in this family include neopullulanase, which hydrolyses pullulan to <b>panose,</b> and cyclomaltodextrinase, which hydrolyses cyclodextrins.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>PANOSE</b> System is {{a method}} for {{classifying}} typefaces solely on their visual characteristics, developed by Benjamin Bauermeister. It {{can be used to}} identify an unknown font from a sample image or to match a known font to its closest visual neighbor from a font pool. The word [...] "PANOSE" [...] is composed of letters taken from the six classes in which the creator of the system organized the Latin alphabet.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "oligosaccharide" [...] {{encompasses}} carbohydrates {{that are}} larger than simple di- or tri-saccharides, but smaller than polysaccharides (greater than 10 units). Isomalto-oligosaccharides (IMO) are glucose oligomers with α-D-(1,6)-linkages, including isomaltose, <b>panose,</b> isomaltotriose, isomaltotetraose, isomaltopentaose, nigerose, kojibiose, and higher branched oligosaccharides. While human intestinal enzymes readily digest α(1,4)-glycosidic bonds, α(1,6)-linkages are not easily hydrolyzed and exhibit a digestion-resistant property. Therefore, IMO are only partially digested in the upper gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{published}} in 1988. A <b>PANOSE</b> classification number consists of 10 concatenated values. Each value from a given category was computed from a specific visual metric, such as {{the weight of the}} font and {{the presence or absence of}} serifs. Special values [...] "Any" [...] (0) and [...] "No Fit" [...] (1) exist for every category, which have specific meanings to the mapper. [...] "Any" [...] means match that digit with any available digit, which allows the mapper to handle distortable typefaces. [...] "No Fit" [...] means that the item being classified does not fit within the present system.|$|E
5000|$|For {{manufacturing}} IMO on {{a commercial}} scale, food industries use starch processed from cereal crops like wheat, barley, pulses (peas, beans, lentils), oats, tapioca, rice, potato and others. This variety in sources could benefit consumers who have allergies or hypersensitivity to certain cereal crops. The manufacturing process controls the degree of polymerization (dp) and the α(1,6)-linkages to ensure a consistent quality of IMO from different starch sources. The starch is first converted, by means of simple enzymatic hydrolysis, into high maltose syrup with di-, tri and oligosaccharides (2, 3 or more glucose units) having α(1,4)-glycosidic linkages which are readily digestible in the human intestine. These α(1,4)-glycosidic linkages are further converted into digestion-resistant α(1,6)-glycosidic linkages, creating [...] "iso" [...] linkages between glucose moieties and forming Isomalto-oligosaccharide (IMO). [...] The majority of oligosaccharides found in IMO consist of three to six monosaccharide (glucose) units linked together. However, disaccharides, as well as longer polysaccharides (up to nine glucose units), are also present. The disaccharide fraction of IMO consists mainly of α(1,6)-linked isomaltose, while maltotriose, <b>panose,</b> and isomaltotriose make up the trisaccharide fraction. A mixture of isomaltotetraose, isomaltopentaose, maltohexaose, maltoheptaose, and small amounts of oligomers with 8 or more degrees of polymerization, comprise the remaining oligomers in IMO. It {{should be noted that}} longer oligomers do not have 100% α(1,6)-linkages; the ratio of α(1,4)- to α(1,6)-linkages is variable.|$|E
40|$|The {{action of}} neopullulanase from Bacillus stearothermophilus on many {{oligosaccharides}} was tested. The enzyme hydrolyzed not only alpha-(1 [...] 4) -glucosidic linkages but also specific alpha-(1 [...] 6) -glucosidic linkages of several branched oligosaccharides. When pullulan {{was used as}} a substrate, <b>panose,</b> maltose, and glucose, in that order, were produced as final products at a final molar ratio of 3 : 1 : 1. According to these results, we proposed a model for the pattern of action of neopullulanase on pullulan as follows. In the first step, the enzyme hydrolyzes only alpha-(1 [...] 4) -glucosidic linkages on the nonreducing side of alpha-(1 [...] 6) linkages of pullulan and produces <b>panose</b> and several intermediate products composed of some <b>panose</b> units. In the second step, taking 6 (2) -O-alpha-(6 (3) -O-alpha-glucosyl-maltotriosyl) -maltose as an example of one of the intermediate products, the enzyme hydrolyzes either alpha-(1 [...] 4) (the same position as that described above) or alpha-(1 [...] 6) linkages and produces <b>panose</b> or 6 (3) -O-alpha-glucosyl-maltotriose plus maltose, respectively. In the third step, the alpha-(1 [...] 4) linkage of 6 (3) -O-alpha-glucosyl-maltotriose is hydrolyzed by the enzyme, and glucose and another <b>panose</b> are produced. To confirm the model of the pattern of action, we extracted intermediate products produced from pullulan by neopullulanase and analyzed the structures by glucoamylase, pullulanase, and neopullulanase analyses. The experimental results supported the above-mentioned model of the pattern of action of neopullulanase on pullulan...|$|E
40|$|A {{new type}} of {{pullulanase}} which mainly produced <b>panose</b> from pullulan was found in Bacillus stearothermophilus and purified. The enzyme can hydrolyze pullulan efficiently and only hydrolyzes {{a small amount of}} starch. When pullulan was used as a substrate, the main product was <b>panose</b> and small amounts of glucose and maltose were simultaneously produced. By using pTB 522 as a vector plasmid, the enzyme gene was cloned and expressed in Bacillus subtilis. Since the enzyme from the recombinant plasmid carrier could convert pullulan into not only <b>panose</b> but also glucose and maltose, we concluded that these reactions were due to the single enzyme. The new pullulanase, with a molecular weight of 62, 000, was fairly thermostable. The optimum temperature was 60 to 65 degrees C, and about 90 % of the enzyme activity was retained even after treatment at 60 degrees C for 60 min. The optimum pH for the enzyme was 6. 0...|$|E
40|$|Two α-glucosidase-encoding genes (agl 1 and agl 2) from Bifidobacterium breve UCC 2003 were {{identified}} and characterized. Based on their similarity to characterized carbohydrate hydrolases, the Agl 1 and Agl 2 enzymes are both assigned to a subgroup of the glycosyl hydrolase family 13, the α- 1, 6 -glucosidases (EC 3. 2. 1. 10). Recombinant Agl 1 and Agl 2 into which a His 12 sequence was incorporated (Agl 1 His and Agl 2 His, respectively) exhibited hydrolytic activity towards <b>panose,</b> isomaltose, isomaltotriose, and four sucrose isomers—palatinose, trehalulose, turanose, and maltulose—while also degrading trehalose and, to a lesser extent, nigerose. The preferred substrates for both enzymes were <b>panose,</b> isomaltose, and trehalulose. Furthermore, the pH and temperature optima for both enzymes were determined, showing that Agl 1 His exhibits higher thermo and pH optima than Agl 2 His. The two purified α- 1, 6 -glucosidases were also shown to have transglycosylation activity, synthesizing oligosaccharides from palatinose, trehalulose, trehalose, <b>panose,</b> and isomaltotriose...|$|E
40|$|The {{trisaccharide}} <b>panose,</b> 6 -O-[alpha]-d-glucopyranosyl- 4 -O-[alpha]-d-glucopyranosyl-d-glucose, {{coupled to}} bovine serum albumin (BSA) via an azophenyl linkage {{was used as}} an artificial antigen to immunize rabbits. Antisera rendered specific for the introduced haptenic grouping by absorption with whole calf serum were studied by immunodiffusion, quantitative precipitation and hapten inhibition. Anti-hapten showed a specificity directed against the introduced p-phenylazo-[ss]-panoside group. Hapten inhibition assays employing various di- and triglucosides, including two structural isomers of <b>panose,</b> established the relative importance of an [alpha]-configuration and a nonreducing terminal (1, 6) -(1, 4) ordered sequence of glucoside bonds for optimal interaction with antibody. A heterogeneity in the specificity of antibodies formed in response to [ss]-panosyl-BSA was evidenced from cross reactions obtained between anti-panoside and various sugar azoprotein conjugates...|$|E
40|$|Aspergillus nidulans possessed an α-glucosidase {{with strong}} transglycosylation activity. The enzyme, {{designated}} α-glucosidase B (AgdB), was purified and characterized. AgdB was a heterodimeric protein comprising 74 - and 55 -kDa subunits and catalyzed hydrolysis of maltose along with formation of isomaltose and <b>panose.</b> Approximately 50 % of maltose was converted to isomaltose, <b>panose,</b> and other minor transglycosylation products by AgdB, even at low maltose concentrations. The agdB gene was cloned and sequenced. The gene comprised 3, 055 bp, interrupted by three short introns, and encoded a polypeptide of 955 amino acids. The deduced {{amino acid sequence}} contained the chemically determined N-terminal and internal amino acid sequences of the 74 - and 55 -kDa subunits. This implies that AgdB is synthesized as a single polypeptide precursor. AgdB showed low but overall sequence homology to α-glucosidases of glycosyl hydrolase family 31. However, AgdB was phylogenetically distinct from any other α-glucosidases. We propose here that AgdB is a novel α-glucosidase with unusually strong transglycosylation activity...|$|E
40|$|The immunochemical {{specificity}} of the combining sites of murine myeloma protein CAL 20 TEPC 1035 was studied by quantitative precipitin and precipitin inhibition assays. Myeloma protein CAL 20 TEPC 1035 precipitated {{with only three}} dextrans, B 1355 S 4, B 1498 S, and B 1501 S, with high proportions of alpha(1 leads to 3) linkages, but not with any other dextrans, glycogen, and pullulan. Inhibition tests with various sugars show that the combining site of myeloma protein CAL 20 TEPC 1035 is most complementary to <b>panose,</b> a trisaccharide DGlc alpha(1 leads to 6) DGlc alpha(1 leads to 4) DGlc. <b>Panose</b> was 3. 3 times more potent than a tetrasaccharide DGlc alpha(1 leads to 6) DGlc alpha(1 leads to 4) DGlc alpha(1 leads to 4) DGlc and 8, 23, 42, > 42 times more active than maltose, nigerose, isomaltose, and kojibiose, respectively. These findings were paralleled by their binding properties as determined by affinity electrophoresis. The association constants (Ka) of these three dextrans to myeloma protein CAL 20 TEPC 1035 ranged from 3. 8 X 10 (3) ml/g to 5. 02 X 10 (3) ml/g. The association constant of inhibitor (Kia) of <b>panose</b> was 8. 19 X 10 (3) M- 1. Myeloma protein CAL 20 TEPC 1035 is an antidextran with specificity {{different from those of}} other murine myeloma antidextrans and from human antidextrans reported previously and its combining site size is at least as large as a trisaccharide. The binding constant of methyl alpha-D-glucoside (7. 2 X 10 (2)) was 73 % of that of <b>panose</b> and comparable to that of myeloma protein W 3129 (9. 4 X 10 (2)) with a cavity-type site and 600 times lower (1. 6 X 10 (0)) for QUPC 52 with a groove type site, indicating that the terminal nonreducing residue is held in a cavity. Inhibition data with various alpha(1 leads to 4) -linked oligosaccharides also indicate that the internal portions of these inhibitors may react directly with a portion of the combining site. These findings suggest that myeloma antidextran CAL 20 TEPC 1035 has a partial cavity-type combining site in which the terminal nonreducing dGlc alpha(1 leads to 6) moiety is held in a cavity with the other two sugars forming a groove. However, oligosaccharides with one or more alternating [leads to 3 DGlc alpha(1 leads to 6) DGlc alpha(1 leads to 3) DGlcl leads to] units with and without terminal nonreducing DGlc alpha(1 leads to 6) or DGLc alpha(1 leads to 3) side chains remain to be tested to determine whether structures known to be present in the three dextrans which precipitate CAL 20 TEPC 1035 may not prove to be more active than <b>panose...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{bottleneck}} in enzymatic starch hydrolysis, like in biofuel industry, {{is relatively}} slow degradation of branched structures compared to linear ones. This research aimed to evaluate glucoamylases for their activity towards branched gluco-oligosaccharides. The activity of seven modified glucoamylases and two homologs {{was compared to}} that of a reference glucoamylase obtained from a commercial enzyme cocktail 'Distillase® SSF'. All enzymes were evaluated for their activity towards <b>panose</b> (glc(α 1 - 6) glc(α 1 - 4) glc), pullulan and a purified branched gluco-oligosaccharide with a degree of polymerisation of 5 (bDP 5) identified as glc(α 1 - 4) [glc(α 1 - 4) glc(α 1 - 6) ]glc(α 1 - 4) glc. The enzymes degraded bDP 5 differently, which was mainly due to variation in their capability to cleave α-(1 → 6) -linked or the α-(1 → 4) -linked glucosyl residue at the non-reducing end of the branched glucosyl residue. By comparing the enzyme activity towards bDP 5 with those towards <b>panose</b> and pullulan, it was suggested that the activity towards bDP 5 could be estimated only when the activity towards both commercial substrates was evaluated. </p...|$|E
40|$|Previously, we {{constructed}} a gene disruption in the pullulanase I gene of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron 5482 A. This mutant, designated B. thetaiotaomicron 95 - 1, {{had a lower}} level of pullulanase specific activity than did wild-type B. thetaiotaomicron but still exhibited a substantial amount of pullulanase activity. Characterization of the remaining pullulanase activity present in B. thetaiotaomicron 95 - 1 has identified an alpha(1 [...] 4) -D-glucosidic bond cleaving pullulanase which has been tentatively designated a neopullulanase. The neopullulanase (pullulanase II) is a 70 -kDa soluble protein which cleaves alpha(1 [...] 4) -D-glucosidic bonds in pullulan to produce <b>panose.</b> The neopullulanase also cleaved alpha(1 [...] 4) bonds in amylose and in oligosaccharides of maltotriose through maltoheptaose in chain length. An alpha-glucosidase from B. thetaiotaomicron 95 - 1 was characterized. The alpha-glucosidase was partially purified to a preparation containing three proteins of 80, 57, and 50 kDa. Pullulan and amylose were not hydrolyzed by the alpha-glucosidase. alpha(1 [...] 4) -D-Glucosidic oligosaccharides from maltose to maltoheptaose were hydrolyzed to glucose by the alpha-glucosidase. The alpha-glucosidase also hydrolyzed alpha(1 [...] 6) -linked oligosaccharides such as <b>panose</b> (the product of the pullulanase II action on pullulan) and isomaltotriose...|$|E

40|$|The {{active center}} of the neopullulanase from Bacillus stearothermophilus was {{analyzed}} by means of site-directed mutagenesis. The amino acid residues located in the active {{center of the}} neopullulanase were tentatively identified according to a molecular model of Taka-amylase A and homology analysis of the amino acid sequences of neopullulanse, Taka-amylase A, and other amylolytic enzymes. When amino acid residues Glu and Asp, corresponding to the putative catalytic sites, were replaced by the oppositely charged (His) or noncharged (Gln or Asn) amino acid residue, neopullulanase activities toward alpha-(1 [...] 4) - and alpha-(1 [...] 6) -glucosidic linkages disappeared. When the amino acids corresponding to the putative substrate-binding sites were replaced, the specificities of the mutated neopullulanases toward alpha-(1 [...] 4) - and alpha-(1 [...] 6) -glucosidic linkages were obviously {{different from that of}} the wild-type enzyme. This finding proves that one active center of neopullulanase participated in the dual activity toward alpha-(1 [...] 4) - and alpha-(1 [...] 6) -glucosidic linkages. Pullulan is a linear glucan of maltotriosyl units linked through alpha-(1 [...] 6) -glucosidic linkages. The production ratio of <b>panose</b> from pullulan was significantly increased by using the mutated neopullulanase which exhibited higher specificity toward the alpha-(1 [...] 4) -glucosidic linkage. In contrast, the production ratio of <b>panose</b> was obviously decreased by using the mutated neopullulanse which exhibited higher specificity toward the alpha-(1 [...] 6) -glucosidic linkage...|$|E

The oligosaccharide fractions were separated by multiple ascent paper chromatography into B 4, B 5, and B 6 groups;The action of beta-amylase on the <b>panose</b> coupled oligosaccharides has been studied. Fractions of the B 5 and B 6 groups were resistant to the action of beta-amylase. By the use of R-enzyme, it was concluded that the resistant B 5 was 0 - 0 -(0 - 0) - 0 -, and the resistant B 6 was 0 - 0 -(0 - 0 - 0) - 0 -. There might have been a small amount of a resistant B 7 with the probable structure 0 - 0 - 0 -(0 - 0 - 0) - 0 -. A measure of the rate of beta-amylase action on the various fractions has been made. The rate of enzyme action decreased considerably as the branch point (alpha- 1, 6 linkage) was approached;The action of beta-amylase on the isomaltose coupled oligosaccharides has been studied. Fractions of the B 4, B 5, and B 6 groups were resistant to the action of the enzyme. The resistant B 4 consisted mainly of 0 - 0 -(0 - 0) -, but could conceivably have contained 0 - 0 - 0 -(0) -. The resistant B 5 contained both 0 - 0 -(0 - 0 - 0) - and 0 - 0 - 0 -(0 - 0) -. The resistant B 6 consisted of 0 - 0 - 0 -(0 - 0 - 0) -. One chain had an effect on the other as far as the action of the enzyme was concerned. The presence of a single glucose unit on the opposite chain was enough to make a resistant bond out of one which was formerly non-resistant. The rate of beta-amylase action on these fractions was also studied. Again the rate diminished as the branch point was approached;B 7 from the salivary amylase hydrolysis of amylopectin was separated by paper chromatography. This preparation consisted of a single oligosaccharide of known structure, 0 - 0 -(0 - 0 - 0) - 0 - 0 -.

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{details and}} impact of oligosaccharide uptake by distinct human gut microbiota (HGM) are currently not well understood. Non-digestible dietary galacto- and gluco [...] (1, 6) -oligosaccharides from legumes and starch, respectively, are preferentially fermented by mainly bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in the human gut. Here we show that the solute binding protein (BlG 16 BP) associated with an ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter from the probiotic Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bl- 04 binds -(1, 6) -linked glucosides and galactosides of varying size, linkage, and monosaccharide composition with preference for the trisaccharides raffinose and <b>panose.</b> This preference is also reflected in the -(1, 6) -galactoside uptake profile of the bacterium. Structures of BlG 16 BP in complex with raffinose and <b>panose</b> revealed {{the basis for the}} remarkable ligand binding plasticity of BlG 16 BP, which recognizes the non-reducing -(1, 6) -diglycoside in its ligands. BlG 16 BP homologues occur predominantly in bifidobacteria and a few Firmicutes but lack in other HGMs. Among seven bifidobacterial taxa, only those possessing this transporter displayed growth on -(1, 6) -glycosides. Competition assays revealed that the dominant HGM commensal Bacteroides ovatus was out-competed by B. animalis subsp. lactis Bl- 04 in mixed cultures growing on raffinose, the preferred ligand for the BlG 16 BP. By comparison, B. ovatus mono-cultures grew very efficiently on this trisaccharide. These findings suggest that the ABC-mediated uptake of raffinose provides an important competitive advantage, particularly against dominant Bacteroides that lack glycan-specific ABC-transporters. This novel insight highlights the role of glycan transport in defining the metabolic specialization of gut bacteria...|$|E
