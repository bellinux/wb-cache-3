60|$|Should you {{succeed in}} {{reconciling}} the Nabob to this measure, {{we think it}} but just that the proposed lease shall remain no longer in force than whilst the Rajah shall be punctual in the payment of the annual peshcush to the Nabob, {{as well as the}} rent to be reserved for the spots of ground. And in order effectually to remove all future occasions of jealousy and complaint between the parties,--that the Rajah, on the one hand, may be satisfied that all necessary works for the cultivation of his country will be made and kept in repair, and that the Nabob, on the other hand, may be satisfied that no encroachment on his rights can be made, nor any works detrimental to the fertility of his country erected,--we think it proper that it should be recommended to the parties, {{as a part of the}} adjustment of this very important point, that skilful engineers, appointed by the Company, be employed at the Rajah's expense to conduct all the necessary works, with the strictest attention to the respective rights and interests of both parties. This will remove every <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> or dispute. But should either party unexpectedly conceive themselves to be injured, immediate redress might be obtained by application to the government of Madras, under whose appointment the engineer will act, without any discussion between the parties, which might disturb that harmony which it is so much the wish of the Company to establish and preserve, as essential to the prosperity and peace of the Carnatic.|$|E

50|$|The {{manufacturer}} is {{held liable}} under the risk-utility test if the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> times {{the gravity of}} injury under the current product design {{is more than the}} cost of an alternative reasonable design plus the diminished utility resulting from modifying the design.

Generally, the simplest way to think of the risk-utility test is the Hand Formula applied to products.|$|E
40|$|Methods are described, by the {{application}} ofwhich the <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> to car occupants in collisions {{of all types}} may be estimated from data on injury accidents alone, without having to make counts of accidents in which no injury had occurred.

50|$|Crashworthiness is {{the ability}} of a {{structure}} to protect its occupants during an impact. This is commonly tested when investigating the safety of aircraft and vehicles. Depending {{on the nature of the}} impact and the vehicle involved, different criteria are used to determine the crashworthiness of the structure. Crashworthiness may be assessed either prospectively, using computer models (e.g., LS-DYNA, PAM-CRASH, MSC Dytran, MADYMO) or experiments, or retrospectively by analyzing crash outcomes. Several criteria are used to assess crashworthiness prospectively, including the deformation patterns of the vehicle structure, the acceleration experienced by the vehicle during an impact, and the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> predicted by human body models. Injury probability is defined using criteria, which are mechanical parameters (e.g., force, acceleration, or deformation) that correlate with injury risk. A common injury criterion is the Head impact criterion (HIC). Crashworthiness is assessed retrospectively by analyzing injury risk in real-world crashes, often using regression or other statistical techniques to control for the myriad of confounders that are present in crashes.|$|E
5000|$|In 1991, Gary Kleck and Karen McElrath {{obtained}} archival {{data from}} 1979-1985 National Crime Surveys and the 1982 Supplementary Homicide Reports.

Results were not consistent with the weapons effect. Instead, the researchers found that the presence of all types of deadly weapons was strongly associated with threatening situations that did escalate to a physical attack. In the case where there was a physical attack and the presence of a weapon, there was also less <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury.</b> Yet, in the case where there was a physical attack, a weapon present, and an injury, there was an increased probability of death.

Unlike for bus drivers, the increase of the likelihood of light, severe and fatal injuries is more pronounced when the third parties’ drivers cross with red or yellow light (22.6  %, 40.8  %, 52.0  %, respectively) than when they approach a stop or right of way sign (13.2  %, 21.8  %, 26.8  %, respectively).|$|R

System performance requirements of active road safety applications include lower latency (= 100  ms), short to long coverage distance (300  m to 20  km), minimum transmission frequency of 10  Hz, and low-to-medium data rates (1 to 10  kbps).|$|R
5000|$|Initially, diving as a sport {{began by}} jumping from [...] "great heights".

This evolved into [...] "fancy diving" [...] in Europe, and, particularly in Germany and Sweden, as a gymnastic act. The sport further improved with gymnastic acts being performed during the diving process, and was then given the names [...] "springboard diving" [...] and [...] "high fancy diving", which were events in the Olympics of 1908 and 1912. The first diving event as a sport, however, was in 1889 in Scotland with a diving height of 6 ft. Today, in Latin America, diving by professionals from heights of 100 ft or more is a common occurrence.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} is to use real world data collected in Orange County, California to learn how crash characteristic relate to <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> crashes. The data used in this project involves crashes that occurred in 1998 on six Orange County freeways including Interstates 5 and 405, and State Routes 22, 55, 57 and 91.

Then, processed data were imported to SAS to estimate logistic regression coefficients.
