As a result, the rock opera project was delayed and the band downplayed their sets of songs in concerts to allow Johnsson to perform. By 8 April, Johnsson announced {{he had been}} able to avoid surgery as his condition had improved through physiotherapy, and the band would resume to perform at festivals by August, although he would have to play sitting.|$|E

During that time, in 1965, she became romantically involved with David Dalton, a professional photographer. She studied the way he worked during photo shoots, learning about how he set up shots and managed lighting and composition. When she began to do more of her own shoots, such as with music groups, he said he was [...] "astonished" [...] at how easily she was able to take control of unruly or uncooperative musicians. She was able to get her subjects to do exactly what she wanted without much fuss. Dalton said that shooting rock groups was [...] "a bloody <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck.</b> But with the lovely Linda, all this changed...Now their eyes were pinned on her." ...|$|E

6000|$|One {{may find}} excuses for Mr. Goble. [...] "The Rose of America" [...] would have tested the equanimity of {{a far more}} amiable man: and on Mr. Goble what Otis Pilkington had called its {{delicate}} whimsicality jarred profoundly. He had been {{brought up in the}} lower-browed school of musical comedy, where you shelved the plot after the opening number and filled {{in the rest of the}} evening by bringing on the girls in a variety of exotic costumes, with some good vaudeville specialists to get the laughs. Mr. Goble's idea of a musical piece was something embracing trained seals, acrobats, and two or three teams of skilled buck-and-wing dancers, with nothing on the stage, from a tree to a lamp-shade, which could not suddenly turn into a chorus-girl. The austere legitimateness of [...] "The Rose of America" [...] gave him a <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck.</b> He loathed plot, and [...] "The Rose of America" [...] was all plot.|$|E
6000|$|The {{only reason}} why dog fights {{do not go}} on for ever is that Providence has decided that on each such {{occasion}} there shall always be among those present one Master Mind; one wizard who, whatever his shortcomings in other battles of life, is in this single particular sphere competent and dominating. At Roville-sur-Mer it was the red-haired young man. His dark companion might have turned from him in disgust: his services might not have seemed worth retaining by the haughty Scrymgeour: {{he might be a}} <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> to [...] "the family"; but he did know how to stop a dog fight. From the first moment of his intervention calm began to steal over the scene. He had the same effect on the almost inextricably entwined belligerents as, in mediaeval legend, the Holy Grail, sliding down the sunbeam, used to have on battling knights. He did not look like a dove of peace, but the most captious could not have denied that he brought home the goods. There was a magic in his soothing hands, a spell in his voice: and in a shorter time than one would have believed possible dog after dog had been sorted out and calmed down; until presently all that was left of Armageddon was one solitary small Scotch terrier, thoughtfully licking a chewed leg. The rest of the combatants, once more in their right mind and wondering what all the fuss was about, had been captured and haled away in a whirl of recrimination by voluble owners.|$|E

60|$|The {{enterprise}} {{had started}} well. To begin with, {{he had found}} the ideal editor. He had met Mr. Renshaw at a down-East gathering presided over by Mrs. Oakley, and his Napoleonic eye had seen in J. Brabazon the seeds of domestic greatness. Before they parted, he had come to terms with him. Nor had the latter failed to justify his intuition. He made an admirable editor. It was not Mr. Renshaw's fault that the new paper had failed to electrify America. It was the public on whom the responsibility for the failure must be laid. They spoiled the whole thing. Certain of the faithful subscribed, it is true, and continued to subscribe, but the great heart of the public remained untouched. The great heart of the public declined to be interested in the meditations of Mr. Philpotts and the humor of Mr. B. Henderson Asher, and continued to spend its money along the bad old channels. The thing began to bore Mr. Scobell. He left the conduct of the journal more and more to Mr. Renshaw, until finally--it was just after the idea for extracting gold from sea water had struck him--he put the whole business definitely out of his mind. (His actual words were that he never wanted to see or hear of the darned thing again, inasmuch as it gave him a <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck.)</b> Mr. Renshaw was given a free hand as to the editing, and all matters of finance connected with the enterprise were placed in the hands of Mr. Scobell's solicitors, who had instructions to sell the journal, if, as its owner crisply put it, they could find any chump who was enough of a darned chump to give real money for it. Up to the present the great army of chumps had fallen short of this ideal standard of darned chumphood.|$|E

40|$|Exposure to {{whole body}} {{vibration}} (WBV) {{is a major}} concern in mechanized forestry work because its adverse effects may become exacerbated by repetitive hand and arm movements, and nonneutral body postures. Moreover, shock-type vibrations have recently been suggested as a possible agent behind <b>pains</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> and shoulders of forest machine operators. Shocks have been identified in forwarders during loading, but the effects of crane work in forwarders have, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, not been studied. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess contributions of crane work elements, and potential effects of the use of three grapple and brake-link combinations, to vibration exposure levels in a small forwarder. Repeated measurements of cabin WBV were acquired, and work elements timed, as a single experienced operator forwarded wood piles on a standardized track in northern Sweden, using the same forwarder and work procedures with each grapple and brake-link combination. The studied crane equipment was found to have little or no effect on the daily WBV exposure. Furthermore, exposure to shock-type vibrations while loading appears to be due to driving rather than crane work. However, there were fewer collisions with remaining trees while using the tilt grapple with brake link, suggesting its use provides a more relaxed and comfortable work environment for forwarder operators and financial benefits for the forest owner by reducing damage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> remaining stand...|$|R
