25|$|The <b>President</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> {{free choice}} in {{selecting}} the Prime Minister, yet in practice he usually gives {{the task of}} forming a new government to a politician supported by the political party {{with the majority of}} seats in the Sejm (usually, though not always, it is the leader of that political party).|$|E

25|$|The President of the Czech Republic is {{the elected}} {{head of state}} of the Czech Republic and the {{commander-in-chief}} of the Military of the Czech Republic. Unlike counterparts in other Central European countries such as Austria and Hungary, who are generally considered figureheads, the Czech <b>president</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> considerable role in political affairs. Because many powers can only be exercised with the signatures of both the President and the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, responsibility over some political issues is effectively shared between the two offices.|$|E
25|$|The Internal Security Act, {{among other}} things, authorizes the Minister for Home Affairs {{to make an}} order {{directing}} that a person be detained {{for up to two}} years at a time if the President is satisfied that the detention is necessary to prevent the person from acting in a manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore or the maintenance of public order or essential services. A detained person is entitled to make representations to an advisory board made up of a chairman appointed by the President who is or has been, or is qualified to be, a Supreme Court Judge, and two other members appointed by the President after consulting with the Chief Justice. An advisory board must consider the representations and make recommendations to the President within three months from the date of detention. If an advisory board recommends that a detainee be released, and the government authority on whose advice or order the person was detained disagrees with the board's recommendation, the <b>President</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> personal discretion as to whether the person should continue to be detained. The President's power in this area is restricted by the requirement that the board must recommend the detainee's release; if further detention is recommended, the President has no power to direct otherwise.|$|E

They lost that majority on November 2, 2010, when Republican Jack Martins defeated Democratic Senator Craig Johnson and former Senator, now Republican Congressman Lee Zeldin, defeated Democrat Brian Foley.

2500|$|The {{principal}} {{event of}} the golden jubilee of Indian independence was President K. R. Narayanan's midnight {{address to the nation}} during the special session of Parliament convened on the night of 14 August; in this address, he identified the establishment of a democratic system of government and politics to be the greatest achievement of India since independence. [...] The following morning, Prime Minister I. K. Gujral, addressing the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort, said: When Gandhiji dreamt of India's future, he had said that the country will attain the real freedom only on the day when a Dalit would become the President of this country. This is our great fortune that today on the eve of golden jubilee of independence, {{we have been able to}} fulfil this dream of Gandhiji. In the person of Shri K. R. Narayanan we have been able to fulfil the dream of Gandhiji. Our President of whom the whole country is proud of, is from a very poor and downtrodden family and today he has endowed the Rashtrapati Bhavan with a new pride and respect. It is a matter of further happiness that the <b>President</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> very high place among the intellectuals of this country. This is a feather in the cap of our democracy that the backward sections of the society today are attaining their rightful place in society. All the countrymen today whether they are from minorities, scheduled castes , or scheduled tribes [...] -- are working unitedly for the development of the country.|$|E

60|$|The {{practice}} of naming attachés to our legations leads to great abuses of this nature. In {{the first place}} the Constitution is violated; for, without a law of Congress to that effect (and I believe none exists), not even the <b>President</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> right to name one, without {{the approval of the}} Senate. In no case can a minister appoint one legally, for the Constitution gives him under no circumstances any such authority; and our system does not admit of the constructive authority that is used under other governments, unless it can be directly referred to an expressly delegated power. Now the power of appointment to office is expressly delegated; but it is to another, or rather to another through Congress, should Congress choose to interfere. This difficulty is got over by saying an attaché is not an officer. If not an officer of the government, he is nothing. He is, at all events, deemed to be an officer of the government in foreign countries, and enjoys immunities as such. Besides, it is a dangerous precedent to name to any situation under a pretence like this, as the practice may become gradually enlarged. But I care nothing as to the legality of the common appointments of this nature, the question being as to the tone of the nominees. You may be assured that I shall send you no idle gossip; but there is more importance connected with these things than you may be disposed at first to imagine. Here, these young men are believed to represent the state of feeling at home, and are listened to with more respect than they would be as simple travellers. It would be far better not to appoint them at all; but, if this is an indulgence that it would be ungracious to withhold, they should at least be made to enter into engagements not to deride the institutions they are thought to represent; for, to say nothing of principle, such a course can only re-act, by discrediting the national character.|$|E
