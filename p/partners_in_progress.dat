40|$|Thanks to new {{insights}} on the impacts that dwellings have throughout their life cycles, {{there has been}} increased attention to retrofitting innovative energy systems (IES) in existing housing. This paper uses an explorative case study design to gain more knowledge about the governance aspects of this under-researched topic. The central research question is: Which factors influence the adoption of innovative energy systems in social housing sites during renovation projects? To answer this question, eight large-scale renovation projects in The Netherlands were investigated. These case studies allowed the identification of barriers, enabling factors and perspectives from three main actors—housing associations, tenants and local authorities. It turns out that adopting IES encounters many barriers: lack of trust between project <b>partners,</b> delay <b>in</b> project <b>progress,</b> financial feasibility considerations, lack of support from tenants, lengthy legal permit procedures, over-ambitious project goals, poor experiences in previous projects, and IES ambitions that are not taken serious by key decision-makers. Furthermore, IES were only successfully fitted {{in three of the}} eight projects. Moreover, ambitions were lowered as the projects <b>progressed</b> <b>in</b> all the cases investigated. The study calls for further systematic, in-depth comparison of fitting IES in large-scale renovation projects in social housing...|$|R

40|$|In the School Administration and management, like in {{any other}} human and social endeavour, human {{resources}} {{are made up of}} men and women who play the most important role, either as actors or as recipients. For any society to be harmonious and balanced, the gender representation needs to be taken into consideration. It ensures therefore that none of the two sexes should be left behind in the management of the school system. Gender as we understand does not refer to the biological differences of sex, which are natural. It rather refers to social constructs, created social meanings, norms and practices that regulate the relationships between men and women in a given society and at a given time. Gender relations refer to such cultural elements that are contextually and historically dependent.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{implicit}} financial incentives of individual Big 4 audit partners {{by examining the}} association between a partner's compensation and characteristics of the audit firm, audit partner, and individual partner clientele for Big 4 firms in Sweden. Using tax and financial data for individual audit partners and clients, our empirical findings indicate that there is significant variation in the implicit determinants {{that are associated with}} compensation across the Big 4. We find that audit partners’ compensation is positively associated with the size of their clientele or the number of publicly traded clients, both of which represent revenue-generating opportunities. Similarly, compensation and developing an industry specialization are positively related. In three firms, gaining clients is clearly related to an increase in compensation, while losing a client is associated with a reduction <b>in</b> <b>partner</b> income <b>in</b> only one firm. We find that audit partner income is more sensitive to performance-related incentives, such as attracting new clients, as <b>partners</b> <b>progress</b> <b>in</b> their career. Finally, we find evidence that audit failures, proxied by reporting errors related to issuing a going concern opinion, are associated with lower compensation. These results should be of interest to the auditing profession, audit firms, and regulators when they consider the effects of implicit incentives of partner compensation on audit quality...|$|R

40|$|There must be {{few other}} {{situations}} {{where there are}} eager purchasers of natural gas (India and Pakistan), willing suppliers of natural gas (Turkmenistan, Iran, Qatar and Oman), and yet, no pipeline. The distances involved are modest, and techno-economic viability appears straightforward. This paper examines in detail the policy, technology, and economics of an overland pipeline supplying natural gas to Pakistan and India. Such a pipeline would be shared by both countries, and would represent a unique opportunity for cooperation. † As pipelines exhibit significant economies of scale, a shared pipeline would offer the lowest price natural gas for both countries. Pakistani consumers would obtain cheaper gas than from a lower capacity pipeline for their exclusive use, also benefiting from transit fees paid by Indian consumers. An alternative to land-based pipelines through Pakistan for India would be liquefied natural gas, which is more expensive due to the capital-intensive nature of the liquefaction process. However, any overland gas pipeline does not depend solely on economic viability, but on political acceptance as well. This study addresses some of the potential concerns, briefly discussing options for overcoming security of supply worries. Through cooperating on such a venture, one that offers the promise of significantly helping to build the infrastructure of both countries, {{there is the possibility}} of the neighboring countries becoming <b>partners</b> <b>in</b> <b>progress,</b> instead of languishing as prisoners of geography...|$|E

The study adopted descriptive survey and quantitative paradigm. The accessible population comprises all the heads and their assistants all English teachers and the English department heads of the ten senior high schools selected for the study. Using multistage sampling technique schools and participants were selected for the study. Stratified sampling technique was employed in selecting the ten schools for the study while purposive sampling technique was used in selecting participants for the study. Sample size for curriculum leaders was 30 comprising headmasters assistant headmastersmistresses and heads of English department. English teachers selected via purposive sampling technique for the study were 70 from the selected schools. Findings of the study revealed that purposes of curriculum supervision are monitoring performance resolution of thorny issues pertaining to curriculum planning and dissemination of relevant information between the supervisor and supervisees. The study also showed that supervisors should involve teachers in curriculum planning and conduct regular but frequent observation so as to fulfill the focus of curriculum supervision. In view of the findings of this study which emphasizes professional development of teachers through constructive criticism and active involvement during curriculum supervision it is recommended that supervisors willingly involve teachers in the planning of curriculum supervision and see to it that there is mutual understanding and agreement of his or her procedure to curriculum supervision. It is also recommended that English teachers should see curriculum leaders as <b>partners</b> <b>in</b> <b>progress</b> who is keenly interested in their professional development and improvement in students performance...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} is a final report covering work performed under Contract No. DE-FG 02 - 99 ER 82911 from the Department of Energy under a SBIR Phase II Program. Wear resistant, hard coatings {{can play a}} vital role in many engineering applications. The primary goal of this project was to develop coatings containing boron and carbon with hardness greater than 30 GPa and evaluate these coatings for machining applications. UES has developed a number of carbon and boron containing coatings with hardness in the range of 34 to 65 GPa using a combination of filtered cathodic arc and magnetron sputtering. The boron containing coatings were based on TiB 2, TiBN, and TiBCN, while the carbon containing coatings ere TiC+C and hydrogen free diamond-like-carbon. Machining tests were performed with single and multilayer coated tools. The turning and milling tests were run at TechSolve Inc., under a subcontract at Ohio State University. Significant increases in tool lives were realized in end milling of H- 13 die steel (8 X) and titanium alloy (80 %) using the TiBN coating. A multilayer TiBN/TiN performed the best in end-milling of highly abrasive Al-Si alloys. A 40 % increase in life over the TiAlN benchmark coating was found.
