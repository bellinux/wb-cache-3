50|$|Epoxies {{are sold}} in {{hardware}} stores, typically as a pack containing separate resin and hardener, which must be mixed immediately before use. They are also sold in boat shops as repair resins for marine applications. Epoxies typically are not used in the outer layer of a boat because they deteriorate by exposure to UV light. They are often used during boat repair and assembly, and then over-coated with conventional or two-part <b>polyurethane</b> <b>paint</b> or marine-varnishes that provide UV protection.|$|E
50|$|The Puchacz is a {{construction}} protected by <b>polyurethane</b> <b>paint</b> {{rather than the}} more usual gelcoat finish.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the influence of Furfurylation treatment on adhesion strength of clear coatings and surface roughness of Beech (Fagus orientalis) wood.

Half of the specimens coated with acid catalyst paint and half of them coated with <b>polyurethane</b> based <b>paint.</b> Surface roughness and adhesion strength (Pull-off) and cross-hatch cutter test were analysed and compared to untreated specimens. Results revealed that 20 % furfurylated specimens did not show significant difference in roughness and adhesion strength, compared to untreated control. But 65 % furfurylated specimens caused decline in adhesion strength and raise in surface roughness. <b>Polyurethane</b> based <b>paint</b> had better efficiency and adhesion strength than acid catalyst paint.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To examine if car {{painters}} {{who work}} with <b>polyurethane</b> <b>paints</b> that contain hexamethylenediisocyanate (HDI) and hexamethylenediisocyanate biuret trimer (HDI-BT) develop acute as well as chronic impairment of lung function. METHODS [...] In this study data were reanalysed from two earlier studies {{on a group of}} car painters to see if a decrease in lung function within the week is a marker of vulnerability in those workers. Data on changes in forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) within the week were available for 20 car painters who were also examined six years later. RESULTS [...] 10 men showed a decline in FVC within the week. There {{were no significant differences in}} age, duration of employment, exposures during the follow up period, or smoking between car painters who had decline in lung function within the week and car painters who had not. A significant correlation was found between the change in FVC within the week and the long term (six year) change in FVC, standardised for the effects of aging and smoking, and adjusted for the number of peak exposures. CONCLUSIONS [...] The results suggest that the decrease in FVC within the week might serve as a guide to identify car painters at risk of a further decrement in lung function above the effects of aging, smoking, and exposure...|$|R

50|$|The {{secret of}} the Hayman sound was in the {{interior}} coating. It was rather grandly called Vibrasonic but was simply a thickish, sprayed-on coat of ordinary white <b>polyurethane</b> <b>paint</b> (originally with an unfortunate tendency to craze). Its function was to harden {{the surface of the}} drum, allowing the sound to bounce around inside and give more `crack'.

40|$|Gerbera jamesonii (Asteraceae) is a {{flowering}} plant with increasing commercial significance. Today, this plant {{has become one}} of the leading cut flowers and ranks among the top 10 cut flowers in the world. It is known to contain a high percentage of anthocyanin. Gerbera petals can be a good colourant source and, potentially, a good source of antioxidants. Having potential for producing colourants, the focus of this research thus mainly aimed to extract anthocyanin pigments from fresh G. jamesonii petals and to study the optimum condition for natural paint production from the anthocyanin extracts. Petals from G. jamesonii were collected and dried. Extracts of Gerbera petals were prepared by extracting dried petals using 70 methanol. The extracts were then centrifuged at 5000 rev min(- 1) for 15 min, and the supernatant, anthocyanin, was used in the production of natural <b>paint.</b> <b>Polyurethane</b> was used as binder in the paint formulation. Higher concentrations of colourants have shown more stability with the addition of <b>polyurethane</b> in <b>paint</b> systems. The addition of 1 benzoic acid as a co-pigment enhanced the stability of the anthocyanin colour and the quality of the natural paint. In this work, an attempt was made to use natural products in the coating industry...|$|R

The diffusion parameters obtained from the experiment conducted up to saturation limits agreed well with the data computed using moisture absorption programme (M 8 gain) proposed by G. S. Springer.

40|$|The Air Quality Utility Information System (AQUIS) is a {{database}} management system that operates under dBASE IV. It runs on an IBM-compatible personal computer (PC) with MS DOS 5. 0 or later, 4 megabytes of memory, and 30 megabytes of disk space. AQUIS calculates emissions for both traditional and toxic pollutants and reports emissions in user-defined formats. The system was originally designed for use at 7 facilities of the Air Force Materiel Command, and now more than 50 facilities use it. Within the last two years, the system {{has been used in}} support of Title V permit applications at Department of Defense facilities. Growth in the user community, changes and additions to reference emission factor data, and changing regulatory requirements have demanded additions and enhancements to the system. These changes have ranged from adding or updating an emission factor to restructuring databases and adding new capabilities. Quality assurance (QA) procedures have been developed to ensure that emission calculations are correct even when databases are reconfigured and major changes in calculation procedures are implemented. This paper describes these QA and updating procedures. Some user facilities include light industrial operations associated with aircraft maintenance. These facilities have operations such as fiberglass and composite layup and plating operations for which standard emission factors are not available or are inadequate. In addition, generally applied procedures such as material balances may need special treatment to work in an automated environment, for example, in the use of oils and greases and when materials such as <b>polyurethane</b> <b>paints</b> react chemically during application. Some techniques used in these situations are highlighted here. To provide a framework for the main discussions, this paper begins with a description of AQUIS...|$|R
50|$|The team {{continues}} {{to fly the}} F-16, having switched from the F-16A to the F-16C in 1992. Only a few minor modifications differentiate a Thunderbird from an operational F-16C.

All of the modification work is performed at the maintenance depot at Hill AFB near Ogden, Utah. Other than those modifications, the aircraft are taken from the standard USAF inventory as production fighters, and can be returned to an operational squadron in short order without any major modification.|$|E
50|$|The 1969 {{conversion}} to the F-4 {{was the most}} extensive in the team’s history. Among other modifications, paints that had worked on the F-100 appeared blotchy on the F-4 because of multicolored alloys used to resist heat and friction at Mach 2 speeds. A <b>polyurethane</b> <b>paint</b> base was developed to resolve the problem. The white paint base remains a part of today’s Thunderbird aircraft. A popular myth is, given the exhaust emissions of the F-4's engines, the vertical stabilizer of the No. 4 slot aircraft was painted flat black. However, this is false; the vertical stabilizer of the No. 4 slot aircraft was allowed to be blackened by jet exhaust starting in 1960. Phantoms were used from 1969 to 1973.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine adhesive strength of particleboard and medium density fiberboard (MDF) finished with two types of paints.

The highest adhesion strength value of 3. 62 [*]MPa was found for MDF samples coated with paint. Based on the statistical analysis type of substrate significantly influenced overall adhesion strength of the samples while type and layer thickness of paint as well as number of layers applied to the surface of specimens have not affected significantly adhesion resistance of the panels used in this work. It appears that pull-off test can effectively be used to determine and evaluate adhesion strength of the samples considered in the experiments...|$|R
