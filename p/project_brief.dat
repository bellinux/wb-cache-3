POE usually involves feedback from the building occupants, through questionnaires, interviews and workshops, but may also involve more objective measures such as environmental monitoring, space measurement and cost analysis.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – To {{describe}} {{a research project}} which seeks to establish a value management framework for <b>project</b> <b>briefing</b> to systematically identify and clarify client requirements, and represent these requirements precisely and explicitly to facilitate the design process. Design/methodology/approach – Two research instruments are used: structured questionnaire survey to validate the theoretical framework established; and experiments to test the proposed value management framework with real-life projects, supported by case studies. Findings – The primary research findings of this project are the identification of 13 variables that {{have an impact on}} the briefing process, which form the basis of the theoretical framework. It is revealed that the theoretical foundation of the research supports the use of value management to the briefing process. Further validation will be completed by conducting questionnaire survey and real-life case studies. Originality/value – This paper improves comprehension of the nature, characteristics and problems of the briefing process. It also introduces the theoretical foundation of the research project and describes the process for the development of the value management framework for <b>project</b> <b>briefing.</b> Findings – The primary research findings of this project are the identification of 13 variables that {{have an impact on the}} briefing process, which form the basis of the theoretical framework.

50|$|The initial {{feasibility}} and concept {{master plan}} was prepared jointly by Deloitte and Pell Frischmann, a UK based design consultancy {{and funded by}} the International Finance Corporation. At that stage, the <b>project</b> <b>brief</b> was limited to a Technology Park of 700 acre with BPO/ IT businesses at its core. During the feasibility study, Pell Frischmann proposed a city - Konza Technopolis to make the technology park a more viable destination. The Kenyan government agreed and commissioned a new master plan for a city of 5000 acre that was completed by Pell Frischmann. World class infrastructure, sustainability and inclusive growth were the key drivers of this master-plan. The brand identity of Konza Technopolis as “the Silicon Savannah” and supporting promotional materials by Pell Frischmann and Urban Graphics, crystallised the Kenyan Government’s vision of creating a world class city, powered by a thriving IT sector and generating 100,000 jobs by 2030.|$|E
5000|$|It {{should not}} be {{confused}} with a project product description(PPD), which (in the PRINCE2 method) is generated in the start up process of the pre-project stage, and forms part of the <b>Project</b> <b>Brief.</b> While the PPD is related to [...] "finalist products"—those delivered to the client at the end of the project—the PDD refers to all project products, including intermediate products necessary in the project life that need definition.For example, in a project to build a plane wing, the finalist product is the actual wing, and has acceptance criteria defined in the corresponding PPD. However, the project may require simulations, and even a wind-tunnel prototype and testing rig. Those are intermediate products, not handed delivered to the client. However they are still subject to definitions and quality criteria that is detailed in the corresponding PDDS. Therefore, all product contained in the PPD are also in the PDDS, but not the other way.|$|E

40|$|Briefing is {{the process}} by which client {{requirements}} are identified, clarified and articulated in the early design stage of construction projects. It is crucial to the successful delivery of construction projects. Considerable research has been conducted in briefing during the past two decades. However, current briefing practices are considered inadequate by many researchers and little research has been done in sufficient depth to explore briefing variables in the construction industry. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework of the variables that have an impact on construction <b>project</b> <b>briefing.</b> A questionnaire survey was conducted to validate these variables among project managers and architects in Hong Kong, the UK and the USA. The results indicated that while {{there were no significant differences}} between the samples in the UK and the USA on the variables for construction <b>project</b> <b>briefing,</b> the views of the samples in Hong Kong deviated from the two Western countries. The Western professionals have more positive answers to most of the statements in the questionnaire. The findings have significant implications for industry practitioners to produce their guidelines for the briefing process and for the authors to draft a "how-to" briefing guide for construction projects.

40|$|Aims: The paper {{reviews the}} {{development}} of information and communication technology in briefing and proposes a collaborative briefing framework to extend key stakeholder engagement, aiming to improve the efficiency and reliability of <b>project</b> <b>briefing</b> for megaprojects. Scope: Authors introduce an innovative collaborative approach to promote stakeholder involvement by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of managing {{a large group of}} stakeholders, harnessing collaboration technology. Drawing parallels with biological neural networks in humans, a conceptual collaborative briefing framework is proposed to demonstrate how briefing team members can work collaboratively as a virtual organisation through a shared digital workspace. This framework has five core elements: integrated briefing team, collaborative briefing job plan, computer supported cooperative work platform, requirements processing models and facilitation models. Conclusion: The proposed framework supplements face-to-face discussion with computer mediated discussion, depending on the type, flexibility and interaction needed for different aspects in briefing. This "hybrid briefing method" would maximise the benefits to costs ratio of expanded stakeholder engagement in <b>project</b> <b>briefing.</b> The framework is expected to promote the accuracy and transparency of 'requirements identification' processing, the effective engagement and appropriate integration of more stakeholder inputs and finally, to improve the efficiency and reliability of briefing outputs. Lastly, some framework limitations are discussed, aimed at further development and a computer prototype. © 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
