If the collectivities fail to reach a unanimous decision {{about the future of the}} CFP franc, it would be technically possible to implement an individual currency decision for each territory.|$|E

50|$|A fixed exchange-rate {{system can}} also be used as a means to control the {{behavior}} of a currency, such as by limiting rates of inflation. However, in doing so, the <b>pegged</b> <b>currency</b> is then controlled by its reference value. As such, when the reference value rises or falls, it then follows that the value(s) of any currencies pegged to it will also rise and fall in relation to other currencies and commodities with which the <b>pegged</b> <b>currency</b> can be traded. In other words, a <b>pegged</b> <b>currency</b> is dependent on its reference value to dictate how its current worth is defined at any given time. In addition, according to the Mundell-Fleming model, with perfect capital mobility, a fixed exchange rate prevents a government from using domestic monetary policy in order to achieve macroeconomic stability.|$|E

40|$|We {{identify}} a disconnect between historical and model-based {{assessments of the}} costs of <b>currency</b> <b>pegs</b> due to nominal rigidities. While the former attribute major contractions and massive unemployment to <b>currency</b> <b>pegs,</b> the latter find miniscule welfare losses. The goal {{of this paper is to}} reconcile these two assessments. We refocus attention to downward wage inflexibility as the central source of nominal rigidity. More importantly, our model departs from existing sticky wage models in the Calvo-Rotemberg tradition in that employment is not always demand determined. This departure creates an endogenous connection between macroeconomic volatility and the average level of unemployment and in this way opens the door to large welfare gains from stabilization policy. In a calibrated version of the model, an external crisis, defined as a two-standard-deviation decline in tradable output and a two-standard-deviation increase in the country interest rate premium, causes the unemployment rate to rise by more than 20 percentage points under a <b>peg.</b> <b>Currency</b> <b>pegs</b> are shown to be highly costly also during regular business-cycle fluctuations. The median welfare cost of a <b>currency</b> <b>peg</b> is 4 and 10 percent of consumption per period. ...|$|R

40|$|It is {{said that}} a country’s <b>currency</b> <b>peg</b> can become <b>currency</b> {{manipulation}} representing protracted government intervention in the foreign exchange market that gives it unfair competitive advantage in international trade yet prevents effective balance of payments in its trade partners. Regarding this widespread fallacy, this paper explains why <b>currency</b> <b>peg</b> is not <b>currency</b> manipulation even when it keeps a country’s currency undervalued. We clarify that 1) government is inherently {{a major player in}} the financial market and hence “no protracted intervention” is a meaningless guideline for designating currency manipulation; 2) exchange rate flexibility is neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition for fixing current account imbalance and hence <b>currency</b> <b>peg</b> would not prevent effective current account adjustments; and 3) as far as causing “unfair” trade advantage is concerned, <b>currency</b> <b>peg</b> is less guilty than the attempt to prevent or fix current account imbalance; and obligating a country to adjust its currency to accommodate its trade partners’ current account management would unfairly impair this country’s trade advantage. currency manipulation; current account; exchange rate; RMB controversies...|$|R

Delays in enterprise restructuring and failure to develop a well-functioning capital market played major roles in Czech economic troubles, which culminated in a currency crisis in May. The formerly <b>pegged</b> <b>currency</b> was forced into a floating system as investors sold their Korunas faster than the government could buy them.

50|$|The anchors {{discussed}} in this article suggest that keeping inflation at the desired level is feasible by setting a target interest rate, money supply growth rate, price level, or rate of depreciation. However, these anchors are only valid if a central bank commits to maintaining them. This, in turn, requires that the central bank abandons their monetary policy autonomy in the long run. Should a central bank use one of these anchors to maintain a target inflation rate, they would have to forfeit using other policies. On that note, it is important to mention that using these anchors may prove more complicated for certain exchange rate regimes. Freely floating or managed floating regimes, have more options to affect their inflation, because they enjoy more flexibility than a <b>pegged</b> <b>currency</b> or a country without a currency. The latter regimes would have to implement an exchange rate target to influence their inflation, as none of the other instruments are available to them.|$|E

40|$|Several {{countries}} in eastern Europe may accede to the European Union {{in about two}} years time, making them candidates to join Europe’s single currency from 2006. Some well-known economists have advocated that {{countries in}} eastern Europe adopt the euro now either unilaterally or by prior arrangement with the EU. Such official currency substitution is typically termed “dollarisation ” or “euroisation”, and is the most extreme form of a hard <b>peg</b> <b>currency</b> regime. This paper brings together perspectives from a conference “Dollarisation and Euroisation: Viable Policy Options? ” held at the LSE in May 2002. We discuss {{a number of issues}} associated with dollarisation or euroisation, including: the credibility of the monetary regime, the implications for domestic inflation, the importance of other macroeconomic policies, the reversibility of hard <b>peg</b> <b>currency</b> regimes, the outlook of the reserve currency issuer, and the broader context in which dollarisation or euroisation is pursued. Finally, we address some particular issues associated with euroisation for EU accession countries. Euroisation prior to EU accession may help to forestall a speculative attack, but it must be implemented {{in a way that is}} consistent with the Maastricht Treaty and does not impede progress toward EMU membership...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{has suggested that}} pegged exchange rates are associated with lower inflation than floating rates. In which direction does the causality run? Using data from a large sample of developing countries from 1984 to 2000, we confirm that "hard" <b>pegs</b> (<b>currency</b> boards or a shared currency) reduce inflation and money growth. There is no evidence that "soft" pegs confer any monetary discipline. The choice between soft pegs and floats is determined by inflation: when inflation is low, pegs tend to be chosen and sustained, and when inflation is high, either floats are chosen or there are frequent regime switches. ...|$|R

There {{is no evidence that}} soft pegs confer any monetary discipline, after other factors are controlled for. Inflation triggers regime switches.

Under soft pegs, as under floats, increased fiscal deficits and positive inflation shocks are associated with higher monetary growth. The apparently slower per capita output growth under hard pegs is explained by their geographical distribution. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} {{two independent}} parts. In the first part, we develop a pathwise calculus for functionals of integer-valued measures {{and extend the}} framework of Functional Itô Calculus to functionals of integer-valued random measures by constructing a ’stochastic derivative’ operator with respect to such integer-valued random measures. This allows us to obtain weak martingale representation formulae holding beyond the class of Poisson random measures, and allowing for random and time-dependent compensators. We study the behaviour of this operator and compare it with other previous approaches in the literature, providing in passing {{a review of the}} various Malliavin approaches for jump processes. Finally, some examples of computations are provided. The second part is oriented towards nonparametric statistics, with a financial application as our main goal: we aim at recovering a surface of FX call options on a <b>pegged</b> <b>currency</b> such as the Hong Kong dollar against the U. S. dollar, based on a small number of noisy measurements (the market bid-ask quotes). Inspiring ourselves from the Compressed Sensing literature, we develop a methodology that aims at recovering an arbitrage-free call surface. We first apply this methodology, based on tensor polynomial decomposition of the surface, to a sparse set of call-option prices on the S&P 500, recovering the call option prices within desired tolerance, as well as a smooth local-volatility surface. On a <b>pegged</b> <b>currency</b> such as the HKD/USD, it appears that tensor polynomials may not be an adequate way to model the smiles across maturities. Modifying the methodology in favour of structure-preserving functions, we apply the new methodology to our HKD/USD dataset, recovering the smiles, and the corresponding state-price density.
