The program addresses the public sector's future need of competent and committed administrators by training these young adults in the operations of state government. Over the course of the fellowship year, the program provides a public sector management training program encouraging fellows to remain in a career oriented toward public service.|$|E

50|$|FORPLAN is the {{outgrowth}} {{of a series}} of LP systems developed and used by the United States Forest Service, including Resource Capability System (RCS), Resource Allocation Analysis (RAA), Timber Resource Allocation Method (Timber RAM), Multiple Use Sustained Yield Calculation Technique (MUSYC), ADVENT (a system used for <b>program</b> <b>budgeting),</b> and Integrated Resource Planning Model (IRPM). As part of its growing centralization, the Forest Service directed all forests to use FORPLAN rather than competing computer models. FORPLAN allowed planners to enter information about the forest into the computer and then inquire as to, e.g., the maximum amount of timber that could be cut or how much timber could be cut in a decade if the forest were managed to earn maximum profits. FORPLAN allowed planners to break forests up into different zones based on factors such as vegetation, age of timber, wildlife habitat, steepness of slope, or whether the zone had roads.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Program</b> <b>budgeting</b> in Victoria (as well as {{in other}} states and countries) {{initially}} focused on inputs (such {{as the number of}} pens used, the number of phone calls made, etcetera) rather than outputs. The 1980s and 1990s was a period of reflection about the effectiveness of the public service in carrying out its core functions. Reforms of this period aimed to make the public service more flexible, efficient, and responsive to government direction. Modern public service became characterised by a stronger focus on objectives with performance being assessed on the basis of results. Private sector management and employment practices were commonly adopted in the public sector. As of 2009, Victorian public finance still focused on outputs while many other jurisdictions were starting to focus on outcomes. The Victorian model's focus on delivering outputs instead of outcomes was part of a deliberate incremental strategy to emphasise outcomes once the output management framework was in place. While Victorian public finance legislation does not require the specification of outcomes, in 2001 the Victorian Government released Growing Victoria Together, which sets out its long-term goals (or outcomes), including performance measures for social, environmental, and economic progress. Progress against these performance measures is reported annually in the Growing Victoria Together Progress Report published in the budget papers.|$|E

Each program {{is run by}} a Head Program Director, a student who bears responsibility for setting goals for the <b>program,</b> <b>budgeting</b> funds, coordinating events, and training the 10-11 Program Directors who work under them in the program. In all, there are about 200 Program Directors who are each in charge of about 10-25 volunteers within a specific program. It is their job to motivate and train volunteers, and they show their willingness to do this with a ten-hour-a-week time commitment. This leadership pyramid is supported at its base by over 3000 student volunteers. These are undergraduate students committed to work for between one and five hours per week on the program to which they belong. Overseeing everything is the staff of Madison House, composed of specialists trained at managing non-profit organizations. They are in charge of the Head Program Directors and help to connect many of the programs to the Charlottesville community. There is also a Board of Directors, with mixed student, University, and community representation, that determines the mission of the House and hires the Executive Director.|$|E

40|$|Much {{has been}} written about <b>program</b> <b>budgeting</b> and its {{relevance}} to improved efficiency and effectiveness. However, there is little discussion about the relationship between the use of <b>program</b> <b>budgeting</b> and accountability. While, organisations using <b>program</b> <b>budgeting</b> focus on the issues of performance, the accountability of management to an elected body, such as a local council has been given little attention. In this article three questions are posed: (1) Is the performance information available to enable councillors to form a judgment about management's performance?; (2) Is management involved in determining issues of policy, such as objectives, programs and performance measurement?; and (3) Are councillors confronted by a greater volume of budgetary documentation but with no increase in time to consider it? The results show that <b>program</b> <b>budgeting</b> does not always enhance accountability in local government...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 351) This thesis {{contains a}} methodology for {{implementation of a}} program budget applicable within institutions of higher education. The {{purpose of the study}} is to provide an applied example of <b>program</b> <b>budgeting</b> to an educational institution and show the resultant improvement in the decision-making process that takes place as a result of using these techniques. One study assumes that the institution has three primary outputs: instruction, research, and public service. All costs are expressed in terms of these outputs by allocating supportive costs to them. <b>Program</b> <b>budgeting</b> is defined as a planning and control technique which enables managers to plan and control their short-run and long-run goals better than traditional planning and control techniques would allow. The study is organized two chapters. Chapter I explains the nature of <b>program</b> <b>budgeting</b> by defining the term, providing a brief, history, and outlining the benefits that are to be derived from the use of <b>program</b> <b>budgeting.</b> Chapter II provides the techniques required in order to implement the program budget model. This includes a crossover matrix from the traditional accounting system to the program accounting system as well as the various allocation algorithms involved. Finally, recommendations are made in order to facilitate implementation of <b>program</b> <b>budgeting</b> and to make its results more meaningful...|$|E
