5|$|After D-Day, Allied troops {{crossed the}} Belgian {{frontier}} on 1 September 1944. German forces {{did little to}} oppose the liberating forces, which by 4 September were in control of Brussels, although the last occupied parts of Belgian territory were only liberated in February 1945. On 8 September 1944, the government in exile returned to Brussels and was greeted with general indifference. Although the King {{was no longer in}} the country, his Political Testament was <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> the returned Government as he had wished, and was soon circulated publicly. At the same time, a copy was <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> the British king, George VI, and was seen by the Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden.

5|$|Also in 1900, a {{proposal}} was <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> parliament by the Islington and Euston Railway (I) for {{an extension of}} the City and South London Railway (C) from Angel to Euston. At the time, the C {{was in the process of}} constructing an extension to Angel from its recently opened terminus at Moorgate Street. The extension plan was initially permitted in 1901, but delays in the parliamentary process meant that it had to be re-submitted the following year. The second submission was opposed by the Metropolitan Railway, which saw the extension as competition to its service between King's Cross and Moorgate, and the plan was rejected. A third attempt, <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> parliament in November 1902 by the C itself, was successful and approved in 1903.|$|E
