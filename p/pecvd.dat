5|$|The lattice {{constants}} of silicon nitride and silicon are different. Therefore, tension or stress can occur, {{depending on the}} deposition process. Especially when using <b>PECVD</b> technology this tension can be reduced by adjusting deposition parameters.|$|E
25|$|Amorphous silicon is {{the most}} {{well-developed}} thin film technology to-date. An amorphous silicon (a-Si) solar cell is made of non-crystalline or microcrystalline silicon. Amorphous silicon has a higher bandgap (1.7eV) than crystalline silicon (c-Si) (1.1eV), which means it absorbs the visible part of the solar spectrum more strongly than the higher power density infrared portion of the spectrum. The production of a-Si thin film solar cells uses glass as a substrate and deposits a very thin layer of silicon by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (<b>PECVD).</b>|$|E
25|$|Anti-reflection {{coatings}} {{are then}} typically applied {{to increase the}} amount of light coupled into the solar cell. Silicon nitride has gradually replaced titanium dioxide as the preferred material, because of its excellent surface passivation qualities. It prevents carrier recombination at the cell surface. A layer several hundred nanometers thick is applied using <b>PECVD.</b> Some solar cells have textured front surfaces that, like anti-reflection coatings, increase the amount of light reaching the wafer. Such surfaces were first applied to single-crystal silicon, followed by multicrystalline silicon somewhat later.|$|E
2500|$|In 2016, a new {{approach}} was described for producing hybrid photovoltaic wafers combining the high efficiency of III-V multi-junction solar cells with the economies and wealth of experience associated with silicon. The technical complications involved in growing the III-V material on silicon at the required high temperatures, a subject of study for some 30 years, are avoided by epitaxial growth of silicon on GaAs at low temperature by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (<b>PECVD)</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{industrial}} and medical applications exist for silane and functionalized silanes. For instance, silanes {{are used as}} coupling agents to adhere fibers such as glass fibers and carbon fibers to certain polymer matrices, stabilizing the composite material. In other words, silane coats the glass fibers to create better adhesion to the polymer matrix. They {{can also be used}} to couple a bio-inert layer on a titanium implant. Other applications include water repellents, masonry protection, control of graffiti, applying polycrystalline silicon layers on silicon wafers when manufacturing semiconductors, and sealants. The semiconductor industry used about 300 metric tons per year of silane in the late 1990s. More recently, a growth in low-cost solar photovoltaic module manufacturing has led to substantial consumption of silane for depositing hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) on glass and other substrates like metal and plastic. The <b>PECVD</b> process is relatively inefficient at materials utilization with approximately 85% of the silane being wasted. To reduce that waste and the ecological footprint of a-Si:H-based solar cells further several recycling efforts have been developed.)". , [...]|$|E
50|$|Another {{advantage}} is that a-Si can be deposited over large areas by <b>PECVD.</b> The design of the <b>PECVD</b> system has great impact on the production cost of such panel, therefore most equipment suppliers put their focus {{on the design of}} <b>PECVD</b> for higher throughput, that leads to lower manufacturing cost particularly when the silane is recycled.|$|E
50|$|Plasma {{enhanced}} CVD (<b>PECVD)</b> uses an ionized vapor, or plasma, as a precursor. Unlike the soot example above, commercial <b>PECVD</b> {{relies on}} electromagnetic means (electric current, microwave excitation), {{rather than a}} chemical-reaction, to produce a plasma.|$|E

5000|$|Lau {{worked on}} gallium {{arsenide}} and gallium nitride devices and materials. He developed the [...] "true oxide electron beam induced current" [...] (TOEBIC) technique to study local defects in insulating thin films. TOEBIC {{can be applied}} to MOS capacitors. Dr. Lau's theory was that local defects in the oxide and local defects in silicon could be distinguished when electron beam induced current was performed on M/SiO2/Si capacitor structures. (Please see references 4-6.) He proposed to use <b>PECVD</b> silicon nitride / polyimide dual passivation for AlGaN/GaN HEMT (high electron mobility transistor). When <b>PECVD</b> silicon nitride is thick, there is mechanical stress problem. It may also have pinholes. Polyimide can be quite thick without stress problem {{but it is not a}} good barrier for moisture. Thick polyimide can cover up the pinholes in the <b>PECVD</b> silicon nitride below. The two combined together with polyimide on top of the nitride can be a practical and better approach. In addition, the dielectric constant of polyimide (about 3.5) is smaller than that of <b>PECVD</b> silicon nitride (about 7), resulting in less parasitic capacitance. (Please see references 7.) ...|$|E

50|$|For <b>PECVD</b> processes, the {{substrate}} must be chemically stable under the plasma which is rich of H-species. Some weakly bonded oxides such as indium oxide {{can be quickly}} reduced in this plasma and is therefore usually not applicable as {{the substrate}} or underlayer. The substrate must also be electrically conductive to sustain a continuous DC current flow through its surface where the CNTs grow from. Most metals and semiconductors are very good substrate materials, and insulating substrates can be first coated with a conductive layer to work properly to support <b>PECVD</b> VANTA growth.|$|E

50|$|C2H2 is {{typically}} introduced {{to trigger the}} CNT growth during <b>PECVD</b> of VANTAs. The flow rate ratio of NH3:C2H2 is usually around 4:1 to minimize the amorphous carbon formation. Behr et al. studied the effect of hydrogen on the catalyst nanoparticles during the <b>PECVD</b> of VANTAs, and demonstrated that at H2-to-CH4 ratios of about 1 iron catalyst nanoparticles are converted to Fe3C and well-graphitized nanotubes grow from elongated Fe3C crystals. H2-to-CH4 ratios greater than 5 in the feed gas result in high hydrogen concentrations in the plasma and strongly reducing conditions, which prevents the conversion of Fe to Fe3C and cause poorly-graphitized nanofibers to grow with thick walls.|$|E
50|$|Chemical vapor {{deposition}} (CVD) of titanium and zirconium diborides {{is another}} method for preparing coatings of UHTCs. These techniques rely on metal halide and boron halide precursors (such as TiCl4 and BCl3) in the gaseous phase and use H2 as a reducing agent. This synthesis route {{can be employed}} at low temperatures and produces thin films for coating on metal (and other material) surfaces. Mojima et al. have used CVD to prepare coatings of ZrB2 on Cu at 700-900 °C (Figure 2). Plasma enhanced CVD (<b>PECVD)</b> has also been used to prepare UHTC diborides. After plasma of the reacting gases is created (by radio frequency or direct current discharge between two electrodes) the reaction takes place, followed by deposition. The deposition takes place at lower temperatures compared to traditional CVD because only the plasma needs to be heated to provide sufficient energy for the reaction. ZrB2 has been prepared via <b>PECVD</b> at temperatures lower than 600 °C as a coating on zircalloy. Zirconium borohydride {{can also be used}} as a precursor in <b>PECVD.</b> Thermal decomposition of Zr(BH)4 to ZrB2 can occur at temperatures in the range of 150-400 °C in order to prepare amorphous, conductive films.|$|E

50|$|Chemical {{deposition}} techniques include {{chemical vapor deposition}} ("CVD"), in which a stream of source gas reacts on the substrate to grow the material desired. This can be further divided into categories depending {{on the details of}} the technique, for example, LPCVD (Low Pressure chemical vapor deposition) and <b>PECVD</b> (Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition).|$|E
50|$|Plasma-enhanced (PE) CVD and ALD {{technologies}} create dielectric {{films for}} a wide range of insulating parts. For gapfill processes, which require depositing dielectric material into narrow spaces, Lam uses high-density plasma (HDP) CVD technology. <b>PECVD</b> and ALD are also used to form hardmasks, layers which can be removed to improve circuit patterning processes.|$|E
50|$|Plasma {{deposition}} {{is often}} used in semiconductor manufacturing to deposit films conformally (covering sidewalls) and onto wafers containing metal layers or other temperature-sensitive structures. <b>PECVD</b> also yields some of the fastest deposition rates while maintaining film quality (such as roughness, defects/voids), as compared with sputter deposition and thermal/electron-beam evaporation, often {{at the expense of}} uniformity.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the major}} {{advantages}} of using <b>PECVD</b> growth techniques is the low growth temperature. The ionization of the neutral hydrocarbon molecules inside the plasma facilitates {{the breaking of the}} C-H bonds and lowers the activation energy of the CNT growth to be about 0.3eV as opposed to the 1.2eV needed for thermal CVD processes.|$|E

50|$|Because all layers {{are made}} of silicon, they can be {{manufactured}} using <b>PECVD.</b> The band gap of a-Si is 1.7 eV and that of c-Si is 1.1 eV. The c-Si layer can absorb red and infrared light. The best efficiency can be achieved at transition between a-Si and c-Si. As nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si) has about the same bandgap as c-Si, nc-Si can replace c-Si.|$|E
50|$|More recently, {{intrinsic}} and doped polysilicon {{is being}} used in large-area electronics as the active and/or doped layers in thin-film transistors. Although it can be deposited by LPCVD, plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (<b>PECVD),</b> or solid-phase crystallization of amorphous silicon in certain processing regimes, these processes still require relatively high temperatures of at least 300 °C. These temperatures make deposition of polysilicon possible for glass substrates but not for plastic substrates.|$|E
50|$|When {{the vapor}} source is a liquid or solid {{the process is}} called {{physical}} vapor deposition (PVD). When the source is a chemical vapor precursor, the process is called chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The latter has several variants: low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD), Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (<b>PECVD),</b> and plasma-assisted CVD (PACVD).
