Relay stations {{are used to}} extended net-work coverage and enhance system throughput. To reduce power consumption, an idle mode MS does not send location update messages while moving across cell borders. Paging mechanism is needed to wake up an idle mode MS. In the 802. 16 j multihop relay network, we investigate the perfor-mance of several location management schemes. In timer based scheme, an idle mode MS updates when the timer ex-pires. In the <b>paging</b> <b>area</b> based scheme, an idle mode MS updates when moving to a new <b>paging</b> <b>area.</b> In the hybrid scheme, the <b>paging</b> <b>area</b> is recalculated when timer expires. An idle mode updates when it moves across {{the border of the}} MS-centric <b>paging</b> <b>area.</b> In this paper, comparative per-formance evaluation is conducted for these location man-agement schemes with different IEEE 802. 16 j <b>paging</b> <b>area</b> topologies...|$|E

40|$|Cellular {{telephones}} save {{power by}} {{switching to a}} low power, or dormant, mode {{when there is no}} active traffic. In dormant mode, the telephone periodically checks for a beacon, and if the beacon indicates that the phone has moved to a new <b>paging</b> <b>area,</b> the telephone performs a <b>paging</b> <b>area</b> update. <b>Paging</b> <b>area</b> update signaling requires considerably less power than is required to move an active traffic channel. When a call comes in, the network pages the telephone by flood signaling the <b>paging</b> <b>area</b> on a special channel, and the telephone brings up an active traffic channel. Recent work has attempted to extend paging to IP networks, in particular, networks running the Mobile IP mobility management protocol. In this paper, we compare Mobile IPv 6 and IP paging for dormant mode location updating. Simulations are presented for a typical macrocellular scenario and a hotspot scenario, where broadband microcells supplement the narrowband macrocells. The results show that Mobile IPv 6 dormant mode location management is roughly comparable to IP paging...|$|E

40|$|IP Paging has {{received}} considerable attention recently. The IETF {{has decided to}} develop an IP Paging protocol and some IP Paging protocols have been proposed by researchers [13, 12]. However all of these proposals use static and manually configured paging areas. We argue that the size and the shape of paging areas are very critical {{for the performance of}} a paging system. A system that allows each host to use a <b>paging</b> <b>area</b> that adapts to its mobility and communication patterns will perform better. This paper proposes to extend the IETF IP Paging functional architecture to support adaptive and per-host paging areas.

40|$|Significant IP {{mobility}} mechanisms {{have been}} designed to minimize the handover overhead of mobile nodes. Although many efficient algorithms such as Mobile IP, HMIP and PMIP have been proposed, they did not attempt to upgrade their paging mechanisms that also heavily affect the power consumption of mobile nodes. Considering a good paging scheme is important because more than 95 % of mobile nodes are moving in the idle state and change their states to active only for <b>paging</b> <b>area</b> updates. However, existing paging schemes assume the configuration of fixed paging areas and do not explore the dynamic nature of a <b>paging</b> <b>area</b> size depending on the states of mobile nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic IP paging scheme, where a <b>paging</b> <b>area</b> size is configured dynamically based on the speed and direction of a mobile node. The performance evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed IP paging scheme reduces the power consumption, compared to a fixed IP paging scheme...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTt This paper gives a {{comparative}} description of two scenarios for location management in a mobile telecommunica-tions system. The first scenario uses fixed location and paging ar-eas. Mobiles perform a location update {{as they enter}} a new loca-tion area. The second scenario uses a time-out based location up-dating scheme. Mobiles start their timer as they leave the <b>paging</b> <b>area</b> they are currently registered in. As the timer elapses, the mo-bile performs a location update. Both scenarios also differ in the way paging is performed. In the first scenario it is only necessary to page in the location area the mobile is currently registered in. In order to do this efficiently, the paging is done in a 2 -step fashion: mobiles are paged first in the <b>paging</b> <b>area</b> {{in which they were}} reg-istered in, and next in the entire location area they are registered in. In the second scenario the mobile is paged in multiple steps: first in the <b>paging</b> <b>area</b> it is registered in, next in a circle of paging areas surrounding that area, and so on, until the mobile is found, or the number of steps has reached a certain upper limit. Results comprise a quantitative and qualitative comparison of these sce-narios, and guidelines for optimal application. 1...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new {{location}} tracking strategy called behavior-based strategy (BBS) based on each mobile's moving behavior. With the help of data mining technologies the moving behavior of each mobile could be mined from long-term collection of the mobile's moving logs. From the moving behavior of each mobile, we first estimate the time-varying probability of the mobile and then the optimal <b>paging</b> <b>area</b> of each time region is derived. To reduce unnecessary computation, we consider the location tracking and computational cost and then derive a cost model. A heuristics is proposed to minimize the cost model through finding the appropriate moving period checkpoints of each mobile.

40|$|Abstract. State-of-the-art {{wireless}} communication networks allow dynamic relocation of mobile terminals. A location management mechanism {{is required to}} keep track of a mobile terminal for delivering incoming calls. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy logic-based location management method to reduce paging cost. In the proposed method, the location update uses an area-based method that uses direction-based method together with movement-based method, and the location search uses a fuzzy logic-based selective paging method based on the mobility information of mobile terminals. A partial candidate <b>paging</b> <b>area</b> is selected by fuzzy control rules, and then the fuzzy logic-based selective paging method pages only cells within the partial candidate <b>paging</b> <b>area.</b> The performance of the proposed fuzzy logic-based location management method is evaluated by an analytical model and by a simulation, and is compared with that of basic velocity paging (BVP) method. ...|$|E
40|$|Efficient {{resource}} utilisation in future cellular systems is partly {{related to the}} location update and paging operations, which rely on "proper" planning of location and paging areas, {{and the application of}} efficient paging schemes. Important is the design of low complexity planning algorithms that may enable the system to dynamically adapt to new traffic and mobility conditions. In this paper we define and solve versions of the location and <b>paging</b> <b>area</b> planning problems focusing also on algorithms that are applicable in real-time. Thus, they can be used to adapt location and paging areas to traffic and mobility conditions. Starting from a formal definition and an optimal formulation, we solve efficiently by means of a low complexity heuristic, a general version of the location area planning problem. Regarding <b>paging</b> <b>area</b> planning, we provide a low complexity algorithm, under the assumption that the scheme applied falls within the last interaction based paging (LIBP) category. The results presented, and the low cost and complexity induced by the proposed schemes, indicates that the real-time application of the schemes is feasible...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a cost {{effective}} IP paging protocol, {{which can be}} used for terminal paging in next-generation wireless IP networks. In the existing IP paging protocols, a paging request packet is delivered to access routers belonging to a <b>paging</b> <b>area</b> by unicast or multicast. However, unicast and multicast result in higher cost, so that we present a selective paging algorithm utilizing explicit multicast (xcast). Xcast is a new kind of multicast scheme for small sized groups which uses unicast with low maintenance overhead. In terms of the paging algorithm, we use a selective paging algorithm to minimize the paging cost, by dividing a <b>paging</b> <b>area</b> into several sub-paging areas, while meeting the paging delay bound. In addition, we propose flexible grouping algorithms. For the performance analysis, we develop analytical paging cost and delay models based on the random walk model. Using the models, we compare the selective IP paging scheme using xcast with the existing paging schemes that use unicast or multicast. The results indicate that the proposed scheme significantly reduces the paging cost compared with traditional schemes, especially when the transmission cost is relatively less than the processing cost and the delivery path is not long. In addition, our flexible grouping algorithms, which are adaptive to the session-to-mobility ratio, provide less paging cost and guarantee equal to or less paging delay compared with the existing schemes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. IP paging aims {{to reduce}} power drain and {{signaling}} overhead of dormant mobile hosts {{and so to}} enhance the scalability of the mobile Internet. Previous IP paging schemes do not, however, scale well adhering to the static location update algorithm. This static approach accompanies signaling and computation overhead even with the costly optimization of the <b>paging</b> <b>area.</b> Excluding the shortcomings of the static scheme, we introduce dynamic IP paging which is simple and scalable, while being adaptable to time-varying patterns of each mobile host. This paper covers the architecture models and protocols based on Mobile IPv 6, as well as weighted dynamic algorithms.

It allows the mobile host to update the network less frequently and to provide the network with only approximate location information.
