5|$|A Multiple Property Submission (MPS) is a {{thematic}} group {{listing of}} the National Register of Historic Places that consists of related properties that share a common theme and can be submitted as a group. Multiple property submissions must satisfy certain basic criteria for the group of <b>properties</b> <b>to</b> {{be included in the}} National Register.|$|E
5|$|Another massive {{globular}} cluster, named 037-B327 {{and discovered}} in 2006 as is heavily reddened by the Andromeda Galaxy's interstellar dust, {{was thought to}} be more massive than G1 and the largest cluster of the Local Group; however, other studies have shown it is actually similar in <b>properties</b> <b>to</b> G1.|$|E
5|$|At the {{southern}} edge of the district, the Michigan Avenue Bridge sits among four majestic 1920s skyscrapers, two of which are on The Magnificent Mile (Tribune Tower and the Wrigley Building), and two of which are not (333 North Michigan and London Guarantee Building). These buildings are contributing <b>properties</b> <b>to</b> the Michigan–Wacker Historic District.|$|E
5000|$|After Helen Roosevelt Robinson died, her grandson, Douglas Robinson Jr., {{sold the}} <b>property</b> <b>to</b> Jan Blair of New Jersey, who {{operated}} a retirement {{home on the}} premises. She sold the <b>property</b> <b>to</b> the Asian Conservation Laboratory in 1974. This organization subsequently sold the <b>property</b> <b>to</b> Frances Kudla, who operated a retirement home there.|$|R
50|$|Investment {{value is}} the value of a <b>property</b> <b>to</b> a {{particular}} investor. In the U.S. and U.K., it is equal to market value for the investor who has the capacity <b>to</b> put the <b>property</b> <b>to</b> good use—its highest-and-best-use, its most valuable use. For other investors with limited capacity or vision, investment value is lower because they cannot put the <b>property</b> <b>to</b> use {{in a way that is}} maximally productive.|$|R
50|$|The {{area that}} is now Palmer Park was once owned by Matt France, the {{earliest}} recorded owner. In 1873, France sold his <b>property</b> <b>to</b> Henry Austin who used this <b>property</b> <b>to</b> raise sheep. The general area became known as Austin Bluffs.|$|R

5|$|Germanium is {{normally}} absent in diamond, {{but it can}} be introduced during the growth or by subsequent ion implantation. Germanium in diamond can be detected optically via the germanium-vacancy center, which has similar <b>properties</b> <b>to</b> those of the Si-vacancy center.|$|E
50|$|Imiza outlived her son, Welf III, {{who never}} {{married and had}} no children. Welf bequeathed his <b>property</b> <b>to</b> the monastery of Altdorf, where his mother had become abbess. She in turn gave the <b>property</b> <b>to</b> Welf IV, her {{grandson}} by her daughter Cuniza.|$|R
50|$|When Richlind’s husband, Adalbert, {{was dying}} (in March 1045) {{he made a}} {{donation}} to the monastery of Ebersberg and left his remaining <b>property</b> <b>to</b> his wife.

5|$|Previously, in 2000, a {{team led}} by P. A. Wilk had {{identified}} one atom of the decay product 266Bh as decaying with identical <b>properties</b> <b>to</b> what the Japanese team had observed, thus lending support for their claim. However, they also observed the daughter of 266Bh, 262Db, undergo alpha decay instead of spontaneous fission: the Japanese team observed the latter decay mode.|$|E
5|$|Properties {{common to}} {{terrestrial}} organisms (plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria) {{are that they}} are cellular, carbon-and-water-based with complex organization, having a metabolism, a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce. An entity with these properties is generally considered life. However, not every definition of life considers all of these <b>properties</b> <b>to</b> be essential. Human-made analogs of life may also {{be considered to be}} life.|$|E
5|$|The French {{instrument}} builder Sébastien Érard {{moved into}} No.18 in 1794. He stayed there {{until his death}} in 1831, after which his nephew, Pierre Erard took ownership of it and the adjoining No.18, and rebuilt the two <b>properties</b> <b>to</b> have a uniform facade.|$|E
50|$|He willed <b>property</b> <b>to</b> nephew Jasper.|$|R
50|$|Persistent: in {{contrast}} to the above two, in this case, the right runs with the property and binds the new purchaser. If Abe sells the <b>property</b> <b>to</b> Bo, Bo must offer the <b>property</b> <b>to</b> Carl first, just like Abe if Bo wishes to re-sell it.|$|R
50|$|The {{unity of}} time rule {{requires}} a joint tenancy be granted both parties at the same time. When the current owner of a <b>property</b> wishes <b>to</b> create a joint tenancy with another party, the grantor conveys the <b>property</b> <b>to</b> a strawperson (often a lawyer or the lawyer's secretary), who in turn creates a second deed conveying <b>property</b> <b>to</b> the original grantor and their desired joint tenant(s).|$|R
5|$|The low natural concentration, and {{the close}} {{similarity}} {{of physical and}} chemical <b>properties</b> <b>to</b> those of lanthanum and other lanthanides, which are always abundant in actinium-bearing ores, render separation of actinium from the ore impractical, and complete separation was never achieved. Instead, actinium is prepared, in milligram amounts, by the neutron irradiation of 226 in a nuclear reactor.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of unbiunium in {{the periodic table}} suggests {{that it would have}} similar <b>properties</b> <b>to</b> its lighter congeners, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, and actinium; however, relativistic effects may cause some of its <b>properties</b> <b>to</b> differ from those expected from a straight application of periodic trends. For example, unbiunium is expected to have a s2p valence electron configuration instead of the s2d of its lighter congeners in group 3, but this is not expected to significantly affect its chemistry, which is predicted to be that of a normal group 3 element; it would on the other hand significantly lower its first ionisation energy beyond what would be expected from periodic trends.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{residents}} on farming <b>properties</b> <b>to</b> {{the west of}} York heard a large aircraft flying low over the area. The aircraft {{seemed to be in}} trouble because the noise from the engines was changing significantly. At times the engines seemed to be operating normally but on at least one occasion all engine noise ceased for a brief time and then returned as a very loud, high-pitched noise. One resident reported that when all engine noise ceased he could hear a rushing sound until the scream from the engines returned. Several residents reported seeing a bright flash of white light in the distance, followed by a loud crashing and scraping noise. Those closest to the crash could then see the yellow glow of a major fire.|$|E

50|$|The Ritz-Carlton, Charlotte {{which opened}} in October 2009 is the first Ritz-Carlton <b>property</b> <b>to</b> earn LEED Gold Certification and the {{youngest}} Ritz-Carlton <b>property</b> <b>to</b> earn five-diamonds, {{and is the only}} five diamond property in Charlotte (and one of only three in the state of North Carolina).|$|R
50|$|The type of {{ownership}} determines {{the rights of the}} parties to sell their interest in the <b>property</b> <b>to</b> others, <b>to</b> will the <b>property</b> <b>to</b> their devisees, or to sever their joint ownership of the property. Just as each of these affords a different set of rights and responsibilities to the co-owners of property, each requires a different set of conditions to exist.|$|R
5|$|Actinides {{have similar}} <b>properties</b> <b>to</b> lanthanides. The 6d and 7s {{electronic}} shells are filled in actinium and thorium, and the 5f shell is being filled with further increase in atomic number; the 4f shell is {{filled in the}} lanthanides. The first experimental evidence for the filling of the 5f shell in actinides was obtained by McMillan and Abelson in 1940. As in lanthanides (see lanthanide contraction), the ionic radius of actinides monotonically decreases with atomic number (see also Aufbau principle).|$|E
5|$|Actinium is a soft, silvery-white, radioactive, {{metallic}} element. Its estimated {{shear modulus}} {{is similar to}} that of lead. Owing to its strong radioactivity, actinium glows in the dark with a pale blue light, which originates from the surrounding air ionized by the emitted energetic particles. Actinium has similar chemical <b>properties</b> <b>to</b> lanthanum and other lanthanides, and therefore these elements are difficult to separate when extracting from uranium ores. Solvent extraction and ion chromatography are commonly used for the separation.|$|E
5|$|After {{surveys of}} {{historic}} {{properties in the}} county, in 2008 the Hampshire County Historic Landmarks Commission and the Hampshire County Commission began an initiative to place structures and districts on the National Register of Historic Places. The county received funding from the State Historic Preservation Office of the West Virginia Division of Culture and History to survey and document its architecture and history. As {{a result of this}} initiative, Valley View {{was one of the first}} eight historic <b>properties</b> <b>to</b> be considered for placement on the register. The other seven were Capon Chapel, Fort Kuykendall, Hickory Grove, Hook Tavern, North River Mills Historic District, Old Pine Church and Springfield Brick House. The house at Valley View was listed on the NRHP on December12, 2012.|$|E

5|$|Although Callisto is {{very similar}} in bulk <b>properties</b> <b>to</b> Ganymede, it {{apparently}} had a much simpler geological history. The surface {{appears to have been}} shaped mainly by impacts and other exogenic forces. Unlike neighboring Ganymede with its grooved terrain, there is little evidence of tectonic activity. Explanations that have been proposed for the contrasts in internal heating and consequent differentiation and geologic activity between Callisto and Ganymede include differences in formation conditions, the greater tidal heating experienced by Ganymede, and the more numerous and energetic impacts that would have been suffered by Ganymede during the Late Heavy Bombardment. The relatively simple geological history of Callisto provides planetary scientists with a reference point for comparison with other more active and complex worlds.|$|E
5|$|Archbishop Robert excommunicated Palatine Denis and put Hungary {{under an}} interdict on 25 February 1232, because the {{employment}} of Jews and Muslims continued despite the Golden Bull of 1231. Since the archbishop accused the Muslims of persuading Andrew to seize church property, Andrew restored <b>properties</b> <b>to</b> the archbishop, who soon suspended the interdict. Upon Andrew's demand, Pope Gregory sent Cardinal Giacomo Pecoraria as his legate to Hungary and promised that nobody would be excommunicated without the pope's special authorization. Although Andrew departed for Halych to support his youngest son in a fight against Daniel Romanivich, he continued his negotiations with the papal legate. On 20 August 1233, in the forests of Bereg, he vowed {{that he would not}} employ Jews and Muslims to administrate royal revenues, and would pay 10,000 marks as compensation for usurped Church revenues. Andrew repeated his oath in Esztergom in September.|$|E
5|$|Around 1845, Rosas {{managed to}} {{establish}} absolute dominance over the region. He exercised complete control over {{all aspects of}} society with the solid backing of the army. Rosas was raised from colonel to brigadier general (the highest army rank) on 18 December 1829. On 12 November 1840 he declined the newly created and higher rank of grand marshal (gran mariscal), which had been bestowed on him by the House of Representatives. The army was led by officers who had backgrounds and values similar to his. Confident of his power, Rosas made some concessions by returning confiscated <b>properties</b> <b>to</b> their owners, disbanding the Mazorca and ending torture and political assassinations. The inhabitants of Buenos Aires still dressed and behaved according to the set of rules Rosas had imposed, but the climate of constant and widespread fear greatly diminished.|$|E
