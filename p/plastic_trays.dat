500|$|The Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is {{cultivated}} {{by similar}} methods but in larger volumes {{and in many}} more regions of the world. This oyster originated in Japan {{where it has been}} cultivated for many centuries. It is an estuarine species and prefers salinities of 20 to 25 parts per thousand. Breeding programmes have produced improved stock that is available from hatcheries. A single female oyster can produce 50–80 million eggs in a batch so the selection of broodstock is of great importance. The larvae are grown on in tanks of static or moving water. They are fed high quality microalgae and diatoms and grow fast. At metamorphosis the juveniles may be allowed to settle on PVC sheets or pipes, or crushed shell. In some cases, they continue their development in [...] "upwelling culture" [...] in large tanks of moving water rather than being allowed to settle on the bottom. They then may be transferred to transitional, nursery beds before being moved to their final rearing quarters. Culture there takes place on the bottom, in <b>plastic</b> <b>trays,</b> in mesh bags, on rafts or on long lines, either in shallow water or in the intertidal zone. The oysters are ready for harvesting in 18 to 30 months depending on the size required.|$|E

2500|$|Snails can be bred {{in boxes}} or cages stacked several units high. An {{automatic}} sprinkler {{system can be}} used to provide moisture. Breeding cages need a feed trough and a water trough. <b>Plastic</b> <b>trays</b> a couple of inches deep are adequate; deeper water troughs increase the chance of snails drowning in them. Trays can be set on a bed of small gravel. Small plastic pots, e.g., flower pots about 3inches deep, can be filled with sterilized dirt (or a loamy pH neutral soil) and set in the gravel to give the snails a place to lay their eggs. After the snails lay eggs each pot is replaced. (Set one pot inside another so that one can be easily lifted without shifting the gravel.) ...|$|E

[...] "At that temperature," [...] Cameron notes, [...] "lobsters do not eat, grow or moult, but they retain their weight, their texture and their taste, drawing only on the nutrients in their blood." [...] He adds that Risley began airlifting his steady supply of lobsters to cities all over the world transforming his company from its beginnings [...] "as a single roadside lobster stand" [...] into [...] "a corporate empire." ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Many {{studies have}} {{evaluated}} the disinfection of irreversible hydrocolloid impressions through different disinfecting agents. However, impression trays can be source of cross-infection requiring disinfection. This study aimed {{to determine which}} would be the most suitable <b>tray</b> (metallic or <b>plastic),</b> available in dental market, and the ideal time to achieve disinfection by using 1 % sodium hypochlorite poured into the alginate impression. Material and methods: Thirty dental impressions from the patients aged from 7 - 12 years and treated in the Discipline of Orthodontics of the institution were divided into two groups according to the impression tray type: 15 impressions through <b>plastic</b> <b>tray</b> (Morelli) and 15 impressions through metallic tray (Tecnodent). The material collection was performed before and after the application of 1 % sodium hypochlorite for 3, 5 and 10 minutes. After the incubation period of 48 hours at 37 ºC, the microorganism colonies were counted on the plates presenting from 30 to 300 colonies to determine the colony-forming unit (CFU) per mL. CFU/mL results were transformed into logarithm and submitted to statistical analysis by applying ANOVA and Tukey test (p ≤ 0. 05). Results: Greater CFU percentage reduction occurred in alginate after three minutes, in both tray types. Concerning to tray types, it could be observed that the <b>plastic</b> <b>tray</b> showed 100 % of reduction after 5 minutes while the metallic tray exhibited 81. 49 % of reduction after 3 minutes. Conclusion: 1 – The <b>plastic</b> <b>tray</b> showed the most effective disinfection after 5 minutes, with 100 % of CFU reduction; 2 – The most effective time of disinfection with 1 % sodium hypochlorite poured into the impression was 5 minutes, for both tray types...|$|R
