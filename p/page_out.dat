25|$|Castro, a {{qualified}} lawyer, used {{his time in}} prison to prepare a speech entitled History Will Absolve Me, which he learned by heart. A carbon copy of the speech was smuggled page by <b>page</b> <b>out</b> of court by the stenographer, who leaked it to a friend from July 26 attack, Haydée Santamaría, and later published it. Two years later, in 1955, a group of prisoners' mothers launched a campaign to free Castro and the other rebels imprisoned with him. As popular support for the rebels and opposition to Batista's rule mounted, a group of political leaders, editors, and intellectuals signed a public appeal demanding liberty for the political prisoners". That year, the Cuban Congress passed a bill granting general amnesty to political prisoners. After being signed by Batista, the thirty imprisoned rebels were freed. They served 22 months in prison.|$|E

Katherine St. Asaph of Time magazine noted that [...] "Sober" [...] was [...] "disarmingly peppy" [...] and set to [...] "the sort of story you’d find in an Evanescence single", while Ali Szubiak also called the song's sound [...] "deceptively upbeat" [...] and noted that Gomez [...] "emotes with a newfound ease", allowing her to showcase her vulnerability. In a separate review following the track's leak, Szubiak found that [...] "Sober" [...] was more intimate in contrast to the sexual nature of other songs on the album such as [...] "Good for You" [...] and [...] "Same Old Love".|$|E

In addition, his brother Tom Dragna was made his consigliere while his nephew Louis Tom Dragna became a made man in 1947. Dragna was the most {{successful}} boss the L.A. family ever had. Although he wasn't able to infiltrate many of the labor unions in the entertainment industry, he involved the Los Angeles family in the entertainment business and brought the L.A. Mafia onto the national stage. He was honored with a place on The Commission, the only boss west of Chicago to hold a spot on the council. When prohibition ended in 1933, Dragna operated a massive loan shark and illegal gambling business. Along with close supporter John Roselli, Dragna's Mafia family ended local gang wars by driving older gambling syndicate headed by Guy McAfee and Milton [...] "Farmer" [...] <b>Page</b> <b>out</b> of business.

2500|$|The third {{match was}} a Taped Fist match between Diamond Dallas Page and Jim Duggan for Page's [...] "Lord of the Ring" [...] ring. At {{the start of}} the match, Duggan knocked <b>Page</b> <b>out</b> of the ring with a {{shoulder}} block. After hanging Duggan on the top rope, Page pulled Duggan's legs around the ringpost and taped them together. As the referee was releasing Duggan, Page cut the tape around Duggan's hands. Duggan then struck Page with punches to the outside, where Duggan dropped Page onto the guard rail and sent his back into the ringpost. Back in the ring, Page countered a suplex attempt into a bulldog. Page climbed the turnbuckles but Duggan hit the top rope, causing Page to fall onto the top turnbuckle. After knocking Page's head repeatedly on the top turnbuckle, Duggan performed a clothesline, sending Page to the outside. Duggan then sent Page back in the ring. As he climbed through the ropes, Page kicked the middle rope, which hit Duggan's groin. Page then performed a Diamond Cutter, and he pinned Duggan to win and retain his ring. After the match, Duggan taped his right fist and punched Page.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} assess not only the type but also the {{severity}} of neglect, doctors employ a variety of tests, {{most of which are}} carried out at the patient's bedside. Perhaps one of the most-used and quickest is the line bisection. In this test, a line a few inches long is drawn {{on a piece of paper}} and the patient is then asked to dissect the line at the midpoint. Patients exhibiting, for example, left-sided neglect will exhibit a rightward deviation of the line's true midpoint. Another widely used test is the line cancellation test. Here a patient is presented with a piece of paper that has various lines scattered across it and is asked to mark each of the lines. Patients who exhibit left-sided neglect will completely ignore all lines on the left side of the paper. Visual neglect can also be assessed by having the patient draw a copy of a picture with which they are presented. If the patient is asked to draw a complex picture they may neglect the entire contralesional side of the picture. If asked to draw an individual object, the patient will not draw the contralesional side of that object. A patient may also be asked to read a <b>page</b> <b>out</b> of a book. The patient will be unable to orient their eyes to the left margin and will begin reading the page from the center. Presenting a single word to a patient will result in the patient either reading only the ipsilesional part of the word or replacing the part they cannot see with a logical substitute. For example, if they are presented with the word [...] "peanut", they may read [...] "nut" [...] or say [...] "walnut".|$|E
