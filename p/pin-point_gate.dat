Rotors are usually made of several layers of steel sheets with thin cavities through the steel sheets, and aluminium alloys are used to fill the cavities by high pressure die casting process, and so bind the steel sheets together. Because of their high fluidity and good damping ability, magnesium alloys can be a good alternative for a high efficiency rotor. In this study, magnesium alloys were used for manufacturing rotors by high pressure die casting process using <b>pin-point</b> <b>gate</b> mold. By adopting a <b>pin-point</b> <b>gate</b> system, additional machining was eliminated and casting defects were reduced due to good castability of magnesium alloy...|$|E
40|$|The {{demand of}} ultra thin plastic parts in global {{industries}} is increasing today. Ultra thin plastic parts are widely produced using injection molding processes {{and it is}} understood that warpage issue is regularly found in producing these parts. This situation happens due to lacking of knowledge in selecting the best injection molding parameters to produce parts with minimal warpage. In addition, designers also have difficulties to control the parameters since the 0. 3 mm thickness of the ultra thin parts is too hard to maintain. Therefore this study is performed purposely {{to determine the best}} parameters can be selected in manufacturing ultra thin plates. Two types of gating systems which are side gate for 2 -plate mold and pin point gate for 3 -plate mold are tested. The results are obtained using Taguchi Method and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and run through simulation software. Both parameters are then compared with each other in recommending molding designers which is the best to be applied at mold design stage. Results from this research recommend using <b>pin-point</b> <b>gate</b> for 3 -plate mold using the outlined parameter setting in order to obtain the minimal warpage of ultra thin wall plastic plates...|$|E
