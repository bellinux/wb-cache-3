40|$|In Sri Lanka most of {{the road}} and <b>bridge</b> <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> are handled by a {{contractor}} and supervised by a consultant. Road Development Authority of Sri Lanka (RDA) is the client organization for the National roads operating directly under the Ministry of Highways. Most {{of the road and}} <b>bridge</b> <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> are handled by the Road Construction and Development Co.

Some of the road and <b>bridge</b> <b>construction</b> <b>works,</b> mainly the foreign funded works are awarded to the independent consultants and contractors through tenders. Claim situations rarely arise with RC & DC as the contracts handled are negotiated contacts between RDA and RCDC. However, claim situations are common in contracts given on tenders to parties out side the RC & DC where independent consultants administer the works of independent contractors. Appointment of a separate Project Manager to look after client's interests from the inception is one of the arrangements used successfully in contract administration. In this research it was considered the Project Management approach could be used to administer the road and <b>bridge</b> <b>construction</b> <b>works.</b> Main objectives of this research were to establish the relevancy of the project management concept to road and <b>bridge</b> <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> and to study some cases and evaluate how this concept could be applied in road and <b>bridge</b> <b>construction</b> claims. For the purpose of achieving the first objective a literature survey and an opinion survey was carried out. Results showed the necessity of a separate Project Manager for the road and <b>bridge</b> <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> and the requirement of an independent Project Manager for large Projects. Five case studies were carried out in view of achieving the second objective. Results of these analyses showed the significance of management inputs to projects which could be utilized to minimize the claim situations...|$|R

40|$|Road Development Authority of Sri Lanka (RDA) is {{the client}} {{organization}} for the National Roads administration operating {{under the supervision of}} the Ministry of Highways. Since 1986 up to end of 2003 most of the road and <b>bridge</b> <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> were handled by Road Construction and Development Co (pvt) Ltd. which was known as (RC & DC), the main contractor organization and the subsidiary of the Road Development Authority. Independent Consultants and Contractors were handling some of the road and <b>Bridge</b> <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> procured through competitive tenders that was mainly foreign funded projects. After the closure of RC & DC in December 2003, the works which could not be handled by RDA directly were given on contract following the procurement procedures provided in government tender guidelines. Those contracts were categorized as foreign and locally funded projects. In contracts administration claim situations are common due to disputes with parties where independent consultants administrate the works of independent contractors. The appointment of an independent consultant to work as the contract administrator is one of the important arrangements in contract Administration. It was examined in this research how far the Construction Project Management approach could be used to minimize delays in claim situation in road and <b>bridge</b> <b>construction</b> <b>works.</b> The main objective of this research is to study how far the Construction Project Management concepts can be used for road and <b>bridge</b> <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> while evaluating selected case studies to see how this concept could be applied in road and <b>bridge</b> <b>construction</b> claims.

40|$|Proper {{planning}} {{and control of}} activities on a construction project is central to successful performance. However the planning function is cumbersome due to the inherent features of construction operations such as high repetitiveness, complexity and uniqueness. Also the more modern the construction methods used, the more tedious planning becomes requiring deeper project analysis. <b>Bridge</b> <b>construction</b> projects are more challenging among construction projects {{from the perspective of}} {{planning and}} management, especially with process automation in <b>bridge</b> <b>construction</b> <b>works.</b> For example, incremental launching is an automation recently employed in many bridge projects that increases the level of planning/ management issues. The dilemma that <b>bridge</b> <b>construction</b> projects face today is that schedulers accomplish the planning of a bridge project based on their experiences since construction methods are often new and there is no specific WBS/conceptual framework yet. The aim of the current study is to facilitate <b>bridge</b> <b>construction</b> projects planning and management by introducing a new technological-based tool (simulation). The paper describes the process followed {{in the development of a}} conceptual framework/ WBS which accounts for the interaction between the variety of resources involved on a case study (bridge) project where the incremental launching method is used. An Activity Cycle Diagram is produced alongside conceptual framework and process models with the intent of illustrating the key steps in the simulation modelling procedure. The developed models can eventually assist in scheduling and controlling inherent features; uncertainties, complexities, and repetitions in <b>bridge</b> <b>construction</b> projects, consequently improving their delivery.

500|$|M-69 {{starts at}} the {{intersection}} of 5th Street and Superior Avenue in Crystal Falls, where it meets US2/US141. The Iron County Courthouse is located at the head of Superior Avenue and overlooks a steep hill headed east through downtown. The City of Crystal Falls states that the courthouse offers [...] "a view of the main street of the City and the scenic panorama of the valley at its feet". On a clear day, Iron Mountain {{can be seen from the}} courthouse tower. It is from this starting point that M-69 descends Superior Avenue through downtown toward the Paint River in Iron County. The highway crosses the river on a historic bridge built in 1929 that features decorative lamp posts and railings. The bridge was rehabilitated for five months in 2002. This rehabilitation involved replacing the bridge deck, repairing the bridge's substructure, and restoring the lighting and railings to original designs. Because this bridge is listed on Michigan's list of historic <b>bridges,</b> the <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> had to preserve the original historic character of the <b>bridge.</b> Final <b>construction</b> was completed at a cost of $1,130,545 (equivalent to $ in [...] ).

50|$|Around 1650 BC a first wooden {{footbridge}} led across Lake Zurich {{followed by}} several reconstructions {{at least until}} the late 2nd century AD when the Roman Empire built a 6 m wide wooden bridge under Empire Marcus Aurelius (161-180). At Kempraten's Lake Zurich bay, the Roman transshipment harbour for goods was located that have been transported on the Roman streets, on the wooden bridge Rapperswil-Hurden and on the waterway Zürichsee-Obersee-Linth-Walensee. Historians mention a 10th-century ferry station assumably at the so-called Einsiedlerhaus in Rapperswil - in 981 AD as well as the vineyard on the Lindenhof hill - between Kempraten on lake shore, Lützelau and Ufenau island and assumably present Hurden, which allowed the pilgrims towards Einsiedeln to cross the lake before the prehistoric bridge at the Seedamm isthmus was re-built.

A small wooden bridge from Ufenau island to Hurden is mentioned around 1430, so-called Kilchweg in die Ufenau. In 1873 the Swiss federal parliament approved the construction of the today's stone causeway and <b>bridge.</b> <b>Construction</b> <b>works</b> have been begun in 1875 and finished in 1878 (in the same year the wooden bridge was broken). The construction costs the sum of 1,462,000 Swiss Francs, of which 1,100,000 have been paid by the city of Rapperswil. In 1878 the Zürichsee-Gotthardbahn established the railway line from Rapperswil railway station via Seedamm. In 1939 and 1951 the now called Seedamm causeway was reinforced to meet the growing demands. Whilst the bridge sections of the Seedamm allow smaller vessels to pass under them, the main shipping channel between the lower and upper halves of Lake Zürich now passes through the Hurden ship canal, which was cut through the base of the Hurden peninsular in 1942/43, thus placing the village of Hurden on an artificial island. This canal is spanned by the Sternenbrücke, which also carries both road and railway. This bridge was renewed between March and November 2010 to allow 40 ton trucks to cross the Seedamm.|$|R
