30|$|The tidal {{fluctuation}} {{of groundwater}} levels is usually induced by (1) tidal volumetric strain changes {{caused by the}} earth and ocean tides or (2) <b>pressure</b> <b>connections</b> between the aquifer and the sea. The second reason is why the aquifer should face the sea. Of the six well for which we have useable data, only HUL {{is located in the}} coastal region (Fig. 1). The phase shifts in Table 3 and the locations of the wells show that tidal responses in the observed groundwater levels are likely to be caused by volumetric strain changes at all of the six wells, with the exception of HUL. At HUL, as mentioned above, tidal groundwater level changes seem to be strongly related to the ocean tide; consequently, <b>pressure</b> <b>connections</b> may make a major contribution to tidal changes there. It is also possible that volumetric strain changes caused by ocean tides were not precisely calculated at HUL. For these reasons, the strain sensitivity at HUL in Table 3 is less reliable than that at the other wells.|$|R

40|$|Nabro volcano {{sits on the}} {{southern}} part of Danakil block to the east of the Afar depression, on the Arabian plate. On the 12 th June 2011, Nabro volcano suddenly erupted after being inactive for 10, 000 years. The eruption caused a 17 -km-long lava flow, a 15 -km-high ash cloud, and ranks as one of the largest emissions of SO 2 since the Mt. Pinatubo (1991) event. This eruption creates an important opportunity to use seismicity and surface deformation measurements to understand the subsurface magmatic system and deformation of a hazardous, off axis caldera during continental rupture. We installed a network of 8 seismometers around Nabro caldera which began recording on the 31 st August and tasked SAR acquisitions from TerraSAR-X (TSX) and Cosmo-SkyMed (CSK) satellites. The SAR images used for this study post date the eruption. We used TSX stripmap mode images from ascending and descending orbits. Using a small baseline approach, we used 25 images acquired between the 1 st July 2011 to the 5 th October 2012 on descending orbit 046, to create 34 interferograms. We complemented these with 19 images from ascending orbit 130 spanning the 6 th July 2011 to the 10 th October 2012 from ascending orbit 130, which we used to create 21 interferograms. We produced a velocity ratemap and timeseries using π-RATE showing subsidence of up to 25 cm/yr centred on Nabro. We used a Monte-Carlo hybrid downhill simplex technique to invert the dataset and found the best fitting solution as a mogi source at 6. 9 ± 1. 1 km depth, and located at a 13. 35 (lat) and 41. 69 (long). The time dependence observed is consistent with a viscoelastic relaxation around the magma chamber, following depletion. Concurrent with the TSX acquisitions, CSK imaged the volcano on a descending track between 26 th June 2011 and 18 th July 2012 within the ASI project SAR 4 Volcanoes, and 64 images were used to produce 171 interferograms which were inverted to form a timeseries using a SBAS approach. This dataset has an overall subsidence signal, but the time series shows a shorter wavelength fluctuation of ground deformation, which is not apparent in the TSX data. We processed the seismic signals detected by the temporary local network and by a seismic station within a permanent regional array, to provide hypocentre locations for the period September-October, 2011. We used Hypoinverse- 2000 to provide preliminary locations for events, which were then relocated using HypoDD. Absolute error after Hypoinverse- 2000 processing was approximately ± 2 and ± 4 km in the horizontal and the vertical directions, respectively. Using HypoDD, relative errors were reduced to ± 20 and ± 30 m in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. The hypocentres show clusters of activity as well as aseismic regions. The majority of the earthquakes are located at the active vent, with fewer events located on the flanks. There is a smaller cluster of events to the south-west of Nabro beneath neighbouring Mallahle volcanic caldera, despite no eruption occurring here nor any post-eruptive deformation. This may imply some stress triggering mechanism or some <b>pressure</b> <b>connection</b> between the magma system of the two calderas. We present both the seismic and InSAR datasets as a joint approach to understand this eruption, as well as further implications for other ‘quiet calderas’...|$|E

40|$|Pressure locked {{gratings}} {{have many}} uses, both {{on land and}} at sea. This is mainly due to {{the high degree of}} flexibility in dimensions and load bearing capacity. Despite the many uses in our surroundings, the term pressure locked grating is unknown to many. This term refers {{to the way in which}} the most important <b>connection</b> in <b>pressure</b> locked gratings is manufactured. Pressure locked gratings are galvanized and/or coated to prevent corrosion, galvanization is almost always used. This thesis is primarily focused on the behavior of galvanized pressure locked gratings. A pressure locked grating is made up of three type of bars: load bearing bars, cross bars and support bars. The connections between the load bearing bars and the cross bars are realized by pressing the cross bar into premade notch in the load bearing bar. The bars will deform plastically, which results in a connection based only on friction. This connection is called a <b>pressure</b> locked <b>connection.</b> The load bearing bars serve primarily for load transfer in one direction. The <b>pressure</b> locked <b>connection</b> weakens the load bearing bars. The cross bars redistribute a local load over the load bearing bars outside of the loading area and reduce the buckling length of the individual load bearing bar. The support bars are spot-welded to both the load bearing and cross bars. Pressure locked gratings are calculated according to RAL-GZ- 638, a standard published by the Deutsches Institut für Gütesicherung und Kennzeichnung e. V. In this standard, pressure locked gratings are calculated on the basis of linear elasticity theory. A calculation according to the EN 1993 - 1 - 1 is not possible because it is not suited for pressure locked gratings. The main objective of this thesis is to determine if a calculation based on the plasticity theory is possible for pressure locked gratings. Through the application of this theory the design strength can be greatly increased, which has a large economic potential. This research is divided up into four parts that are stated below. 9 ̆ 5 Analytical study 9 ̆ 5 Experimental study 9 ̆ 5 FEM validation 9 ̆ 5 Parametric study The vast diversity in size and properties and the complex functioning of the <b>pressure</b> locked <b>connection</b> make <b>pressure</b> locked gratings a difficult product to research. The <b>pressure</b> locked <b>connection</b> also has a big influence on the strength and stiffness. In this galvanizing has a big influence. The analytical study shows that pressure locked gratings fail through: local lateral torsional buckling of one of the load bearing bars, global lateral torsional buckling for the entire pressure locked grating or by a mechanism due to a plastic hinge in de load bearing bars. To research the behavior, numerical models were developed in the FEM-package ABAQUS. To determine the accuracy of these models, experiments were carried out on a number of pressure locked grating geometries. The results of the tests were compared with FEM simulations which made it possible to validate the FEM-models. The validation has taken place on the basis of four test series. Three test series focused on failure mechanisms, namely: collapse due to a mechanism as a result of plastic hinges in the load bearing bars, test series 1 A, collapse due to local lateral torsional buckling, test series 2 A and collapse due to global lateral torsional buckling of the entire pressure locked grating, test series 2 B. The last test series, test series 1 B, is aimed at examining the structural behavior of a common used pressure locked grating. After this validation it is possible to make FEM-models for a large number of different geometries. The behavior of these geometries can then be analyzed. The validation shows that failure mode and failure load are correctly determined by the FEM models. There is however a notable difference between the stiffness of the FEM-model and the stiffness of the test specimens. This difference is likely the result of the influence of the <b>pressure</b> locked <b>connection</b> between the load bearing and cross bars. The research shows that all aforementioned failure modes play a role depending on the dimensions of load bearing bars and cross bars. For relatively thick-set load bearing bars pressure locked gratings fail due to a mechanism as the result of plastic hinges in the load bearing bars. For slender load bearing bars pressure locked gratings fail as a result of instabilities. With the aid of FEM models, it is possible to estimate the extent in which the plastic capacity is present in actually produced pressure locked gratings. This analysis shows that in 72...|$|R
