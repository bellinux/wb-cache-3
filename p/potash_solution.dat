The predicted data of the model were consistent with the plant data of Shiraz Petrochemical Complex, indicating the validity of the model. The influences of the important model parameters such as amine addition and operating pressure on the absorption performance are also studied.

40|$|When Gomori's {{method for}} the histochemical {{demonstration}} of acid phos-phatase (1941) {{was applied to}} various microorganisms, prominent staining of the polar bodies of corynebacteria was noticed. Gomori's method depends upon {{the action of the}} enzyme to separate the phosphate radical from the glycero-phosphate in the incubation mixture, which in addition contains lead nitrate and acetate buffer, pH 5. 0. The liberated phosphate combines with the lead {{at the site of the}} enzymatic activity. Subsequent treatment with ammonium sulfide converts the lead phosphate into dark, easily visible, lead sulfide. When the glycerophosphate was omitted from the incubation mixture, however, the same number of stained polar bodies w^ere observed. It was obvious, therefore, that this staining property did not depend on any specific enzymatic action. This observation led to a simple and efficient staining procedure for the iden-tification of corynebacteria. STAINING TECHNIQUE (1) Fix and dry films in the usual manner by heat.

40|$|Spicules of Leucosolenia complicata acquire crops of {{crystals}} when left in calcium bicarbonate solution.

Continued prior corrosion leads to the spread of the crystal sites around the rays.

The Birtish physicist John Tyndall, a germ theorist and an opponent of Bastian, likewise considered 5 min boiling at 100 C sufficient to sterilize all liquids.

40|$|AbstractAquistore is an {{integrated}} carbon capture-geologic storage project that will demonstrate {{the effectiveness of}} the CCS process, and will ultimately transition into a commercial operation. Initially about 550  tonnes/day of CO 2 will be captured from a steam methane reformer associated with the Consumers’ Co-operative Refineries Limited’s refinery in, Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada using an amine based process starting late 2012 to 2013. Capture will be increased to near 1600  tonnes/day CO 2 by introducing capture to a second SMR in subsequent years. A 5 to 10  km pipeline will be constructed to transport the compressed CO 2 to the injection location. Selection of the injection site location is based primarily on geological characteristics, proximity to the CO 2 source, ease of pipeline routing, and availability of rights to the subsurface. In Saskatchewan, current regulations around injecting and storing CO 2 in the subsurface fall under the Oil and Gas Conservation Act, and injection of CO 2 requires a lease of pore space on Crown Land, or an agreement with the Freehold Rights owner. A significant research component is associated with this project coordinated by a Science and Engineering Research Committee that has focused on assessing injectivity, capacity and containment. A static geologic model for the proposed injection site integrates available geological data and forms the basis for flow simulations to model plume distribution. The nearest existing well to the proposed injection site that penetrates to the injection unit is about 20  km away, and was extensively cored and logged and serves as a preliminary data well for reservoir mineralogy and petrophysical characteristics. The geologic beds forming the injection target are the Cambro-Ordovician flow unit within the Williston Basin that is comprised of the Deadwood Formation and Black Island member of the Winnipeg Formation. The top of this 200  m-thick clastic package occurs {{at the base of the}} sedimentary succession at around 2000  m depth. Shales of the Ice Box member of the Winnipeg Formation form the primary seal at the top of the storage complex.

40|$|The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is {{an agency}} of the United States of America Department of Interior and {{responsible}} for stewardship of public lands. It is committed to manage, protect and improve these lands in a manner to {{serve the needs of}} the American people. Management is based upon the principles of multiple use and sustained yield of our nation’s resources within a framework of environmental responsibility and scientific technology. These resources include recreation, rangelands, timber, minerals, watershed, fish and wildlife habitat, wilderness, air and scenic quality, as well as scientific and cultural values. The BLM received a <b>potash</b> <b>solution</b> mining proposal to inject sodium chloride rich water into old mine workings which still contain valuable potassium in the walls and the large pillars that hold up the roof. There, the sodium chloride solution, through an ion exchange with potassium chloride, will become rich with potassium and then be pumped out and allowed to evaporate in large solar ponds on the surface. The potassium chloride will then be collected and refined. The water source for the project is from a shallow karst aquifer with limited recharge. The amount of water needed for the project will require approximately 10, 886 kiloliters (2. 88 million gallons) of water per day for the first 7 years and 5, 443 kiloliters (1. 44 million gallons) per day for the next 13 years. The recharge area for the karst aquifer is in the Burton Flats karst plain. The geology is interbedded gypsum, anhydrite, and dolomite with the occasional gypsum outcroppings at the surface. There are 79 known caves in the project area and hundreds of dolines. Several of the caves go down to the water table, which is located in the dolomite members. Rainfall in the area is approximately 23 centimeters per year. The large amount of water proposed for extraction from the karst aquifer brought concern that it may dewater the aquifer or draw the groundwater levels down to potentially critical levels. The water is vital to support the areas’ cattle ranching industry. Further, a biological inventory had not been conducted in the caves or in the karst aquifer. Therefore, it was unclear if there were any aquatic troglobitic species that would be affected. The Bureau of Land Management required a complete biological inventory be conducted to understand more about the effected environment. As a result of that inventory two new aquatic troglobitic species were discovered. The agency in conjunction with the mining company developed a groundwater monitoring plan to track the water levels and detect any significant drops in the aquifer levels.

40|$|The Rieseberger Moor is a fen, 145 {{hectares}} in size, situated about 20 km east of Brunswick (Braunschweig), Lower Saxony, Germany. Peat was dug in the fen - {{with changing}} intensity - since the mid- 18 th century until around AD 1955. According to Schneekloth & Schneider (1971) the remaining peat (fen and wood peat) is predominantly 1. 5 to 2 m thick (maximum 2. 7 m). Part of the fen - now a nature reserve (NSG BR 005) - is wooded (Betula, Salix, Alnus). For {{more information on}} the Rieseberger Moor see [URL] Willi Selle was the first to publish pollen diagrams from this site (Selle 1935, profiles Rieseberger Torfmoor I and II). This report deals with a 2. 2 m long profile from the wooded south-eastern part of the fen consisting of strongly decomposed fen peat taken A. D. 1965 and studied by pollen analysis in the same year. The peat below 1. 45 m contained silt and clay, samples 1. 48 and 1. 58 m even fine sand. These samples had to be treated with HF (hydrofluoric acid) in addition to the treatment with hot caustic <b>potash</b> <b>solution.</b> The coring ended in sandy material. The new pollen data reflect {{the early part of the}} known postglacial development of the vegetation of this area: the change from a birch dominated forest to a pine forest and the later spreading of Corylus and of the thermophilous deciduous tree genera Quercus, Ulmus, Tilia and Fraxinus followed by the expansion of Alnus. The new data are in agreement with Selle's results, except for Alnus, which in Selle's pollen diagram II shows high values (up to 42 % of the arboreal pollen sum) even in samples deposited before Corylus and Quercus started to spread. On contrary the new pollen diagram shows that alder pollen - although present in all samples - is frequent in the three youngest pollen spectra only. A period with dominating Alnus as seen in the uppermost part of Selle's pollen diagrams is missing. The latter is most likely the result of peat cutting at the later coring site, whereas the early, unusually high alder values of Selle's pollen study are probably caused by contamination of the pollen samples with younger peat. Selle took peat samples usually with a "Torfbohrer" (= Hiller sampler). This side-filling type of sampler with an inner chamber and an outer loose jacket offers - if not handled with appropriate care - ample opportunities to contaminate older peat with carried off younger material. Pollen grains of Fagus (2 % of the arboreal pollen sum) were found in two samples only, namely in the uppermost samples of the new profile (0. 18 m) and of Selle's profile I (0. 25 m). If this pollen is autochthonous, with other words: if this surface-near peat was not disturbed by human activities, the Fagus pollen indicates an Early Subboreal age of this part of the profile. The accumulation of the Rieseberg peat started during the Preboreal. Increased values of Corylus, Quercus and Ulmus indicate that sample 0. 78 m of the new profile is the oldest Boreal sample. The high Alnus values prove the Atlantic age of the younger peat. Whether Early Subboreal peat exists at the site is questionable, but evidently none of the three profiles reaches to Late Subboreal time, when Fagus spread in the region. Did peat-growth end during the Subboreal? Did younger peat exist, but got lost by peat cutting or has younger peat simply not yet been found in the Rieseberg fen? These questions cannot be answered with this study. The temporary decline of the curve of Pinus for the benefit of Betula during the Preboreal, unusual for this period, is contemporaneous with the deposition of sand (Rieseberger Moor II, 1. 33 - 1, 41 m; samples 1. 48 and 1. 58 m of the new profile) and must be considered a local phenomenon.

In {{this very}} {{interesting}} stand the author gives comprehensive {{preparation of the}} philosophy, which led it with its numerous individual investigations, and over {{the results of these}} test series. It is possible to seemed that the sedimentary rocks formed, because the apparent is not plastic and weldable bodies accept this characteristics have under pressure. Indeed it showed up with many materials, in particular metals that with pressure alone, without heating up from the powder a connected block develops. This characteristics are proportional with different metals of their weld ability. In addition, with the baud a pressure of 10000 atmospheres is sufficient not yet, in order to cause a cementing. Since a layer height of 50000 m corresponds to this pressure, it is impossible that the sandstones formed alone with pressure. With the metals cementing is based on the ability show also in firm solution and diffusion features. Metals is dissolve mutually it can be combined also in the firm like copper with tin and copper with zinc. On the other hand it does not let itself weld together with zinc with pressure, mix also in the melted lead and zinc (perfectly). The more firmly, the less volatile and a material is less fusible, all the lets is with pressure weld together itself. It shows up with diamond, corundum, quartz and other materials. Without pressure, only by bare laying of smooth surfaces {{on top of each other}} such metals, are with each other mixable, can be combined at higher temperature. Two pieces applies mainly for the same metal; with platinum, gold and copper, with the temperature test of 1600 and 1800 ° the lower melting point was appropriate, just like with such, with those the melting point only for 200 ° is higher than the test temperature. Also copper and zinc chop lower these conditions together, as a layer brass form 1 / 4 mm of thickness, also during zinc and lead, zinc and bismuth do not unite. The fact that the solid materials of lower pressure in each other diffuses the results also from the experiments with barium carbonate and sodium sulfate and Barium sulfate and sodium carbonate which from both sides without presence of a solvent with lower pressure became the same equilibrium reached. Chemical reactions in the firm capability of the lower pressure however only then take place, when the volume are not increased. Where by the reaction with Volume decrease is caused, the reaction lower pressure can occur as with mixtures of silver with sulfur with large mobility of the molecules; it does not have to occur however, if the mobility is missing, which with mixtures of zinc and sulfur the case is, although the formation will take place from sulfur zinc also with lower contraction. With agreement a volume distinction occurs, with pressure the coalescence be never caused. with pressure a cleavage is on the contrary often caused with the hydrate of the sulfur arsenic and with the calcium copper acetate. Also transformations of a modification into another, of prism sulfur in octahedral, of graphite in diamond are caused with pressure, and thereby a decreasing of volume occurs. The experiments over the influence of the pressure on firm body did not offer the possibility, the formation of the sedimentary rocks of interpreting in particular the sandstones and conglomerates because quartz does not become plastic and weldable. If however water present with pressure and the formation of a liquid solution is often favored, which works then cementing. In the sandstones and conglomerates consists the binder of amorphously aqueous silicic acid. The author knows by the behavior of these, in particular the younger rocks against caustic <b>potash</b> <b>solution</b> after, by which the amorphous silicic acid is not the quartz grains are dissolved, so that the rock disintegrated. A solution of silicic acid in water can develop with pressure. If one soaks the volume with a colloidal solution of silicic acid, then occurs no caking, because with the drying up, the amorphous silicic acid contracts itself and view the surfaces which can be cemented replaces. One must press evenly as when gluing the wood into pieces together which can be cemented loosely, so that it shrinks with the drying up in the measure like the binder, advances and the relief of that to prevent cementing surfaces. That is caused with the formation of the sandstones with the low pressure of the lay-over sand masses. Reprinted with the permission of the American Chemical Society. Copyright © 2010.
