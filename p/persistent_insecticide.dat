40|$|Abstract Background Recently, {{there has}} been {{mounting}} interest in scaling-up vector control against malaria in Africa. It needs to be determined if indoor residual spraying (IRS with DDT) will provide significant marginal protection against malaria over current best practice of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and prompt treatment in a controlled trial, given that DDT is currently the most <b>persistent</b> <b>insecticide</b> for IRS. Methods A 2 armed cluster-randomised controlled trial will be conducted to assess whether DDT IRS and LLINs combined provide better protection against clinical malaria in children than LLINs alone in rural Gambia. Each cluster will be a village, {{or a group of}} small adjacent villages; all clusters will receive LLINs and half will receive IRS in addition. Study children, aged 6 months to 13 years, will be enrolled from all clusters and followed for clinical malaria using passive case detection to estimate malaria incidence for 2 malaria transmission seasons in 2010 and 2011. This will be the primary endpoint. Exposure to malaria parasites will be assessed using light and exit traps followed by detection of Anopheles gambiae species and sporozoite infection. Study children will be surveyed {{at the end of each}} transmission season to estimate the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum infection and the prevalence of anaemia.

40|$|Introduction. Toxaphene is {{resistant}} to degration {{and has been}} known as persistent bioaccumulator. In oder to understand the persistence and degradation phenomena of toxaphene in soil {{a series of tests}} were run. &# 13; Methods. All experiments for dry and moist soil were conducted with 10 to 20 kg soil samples, contained in plastic tubs. The experiment was carried out in two parts. The five samples studied in each part are described below. Part I: "Dry samples". Soil control I soil amended with 10 percent gin trash/soil amended with 25 percent gin trash/soil amended with 10 percent gin trash and treated with 500 ppm toxaphene and soil treated with 500 ppm toxaphene. These samples were kept dry during the entire experimental period. Part II: "Moist samples". The samples were the same as described in part I, but they were kept moist by addition of water weekly during the experimental period. &# 13; Periodically twenty grams of soil were analyzed using a gas chromatograph. &# 13; Results. Chromatograms of dry and moist samples from soil containers (Part I and II) analyzed up to 12 months after initiation of the experiments showed that no toxaphene degradation or dissipation had occurred. GLC profiles of extracts of 12 months soil samples were identical to those of 0 dry samples and almost 100 percent of toxaphene was recovered in all samples after one year regardless of whether samples were dry or moist I amended or not. &# 13; Discussion. The results suggest that toxaphene dose not undergo degradation in soil" under aerobic condition, so it can be a <b>persistent</b> <b>insecticide</b> in soil under environmental condition...|$|E

40|$|Social insects present unique {{challenges}} to chemically based management strategies, especially because fast-acting compounds commonly applied for many pest insects {{may not be}} the most effective for colony elimination. The reproductive caste of a colony is the most protected from direct damage by insecticides, and compounds that cause rapid mortality among foragers frequently do not impact the reproductive members or even markedly reduce overall colony size. With recent bans on <b>persistent</b> <b>insecticides</b> that previously have been used to control social insects, especially termites, new compounds must be used. Island and coastal ecosystems are particularly sensitive to the effects of widespread pesticide use and concerns about unintentional water pollution and runoff are common, and international attention is being paid to developing sustainable pesticide options for agricultural and urban pest insects in particularly sensitive environments. Given the precarious status of many native insects and arthropods care must be taken to minimize exposure to potentially harmful insecticides and the non-target impacts of these chemicals. However, recent developments in the synthesis and discovery of highly selective insecticides with low mammalian and non-target toxicity provide viable alternatives to the broad-spectrum <b>persistent</b> organochlorine <b>insecticides</b> that have been largely deregistered.

In contrast, DDE and dieldrin accumulated in the tissues and brains of kestrels to toxicologically significant concentrations. Control kestrels remained healthy and accumulated insignificant concentrations of the contaminants.

40|$|Lindane is an {{organochlorine}} <b>persistent</b> <b>insecticide,</b> lipophilic, chemically and biochemically stable, {{detected in}} the atmosphere, groundwater, sediments and soil.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effects of lindane in the wild-type S. cerevisiae UE-ME 3 of Alentejo, Portugal, a unicellular eukaryotic organism, described as resistant to the presence of pesticides or metals. Cells at mid-exponential phase were inoculated in YEPD medium with 2 % (w/v) glucose and incubated during 72 h in a water bath with orbital shaking, at 28 ºC, in the absence or in presence of 5 and 50 μM lindane. Samples from each treatment were used to obtain growth curves and to prepare post- 12000 g supernatant, used for determination of glutathione and MDA content by fluorimetry as well as GR and G 6 PD activities by spectrophotometry. The exposure to lindane caused a shift in growth profile after 24 h of culture, occurring a decrease of cell growth in the final of exponential phase and at stationary phase, indicators of growth disturbance caused by this xenobiotic. Cells grown in presence of lindane showed an increase of G 6 PD and GR activities proportional to the organochlorine level in the media (r = 0. 972 and r = 0. 988, respectively). This response seems explain, in part, the increase in glutathione reducing power detected in post- 12000 g supernatant of 50 µM lindane, as well as the absence of significant changes in cytoplasmic MDA level. The increase in the G 6 PD and GR activities may also be correlated with the excretion of insecticide to the vacuole or with the transference of reducing equivalents which assist to anabolic pathways involved in the maintenance of cell proliferation. Despite the harmful effects caused by lindane, the reducing power transferred by G 6 PD and GR enzymes appear to be sufficient to minimize cell damages in the cytoplasm of S. cerevisiae UE-ME 3.

40|$|In August 2006, Bluetongue disease, a {{viral disease}} of {{domestic}} and wild ruminants (originating from Africa), first occurred in the border triangle of the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany and thus threatened the local livestock. The objective of the present thesis {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of untreated nets and nets treated with an insecticide in order to prevent biting midges (Ceratopogonidae, Culidcoides spp.) known as the vector of the Bluetongue virus and other pest insects (Muscidae spp.) from entering open cattle pens. In summer/fall 2009, field research was undertaken on a dairy cattle farm in Lögow in the district of Ostprignitz-Ruppin in the federal state of Brandenburg. During a first trial (from June until August 2009), the most effective net was identified in an experimental set up that was easy to observe, and calf houses were chosen for this. Two testing groups out of three testing units each were established to observe the effectiveness of both nets one untreated and one treated with an insecticide respectively. One testing unit consisted of five calf houses each furnished with one calf that was reared in the enclosure for a period of three weeks being separated from its mother immediately after being born. The testing units were protected with the net, either completely (side walls and roof) or partly (fence at 1. 8 meters height). One testing unit was not protected to serve as a control group. The level of effectiveness was observed by collecting target insects. One ultraviolet light trap (Biogents Sentinel® UV light trap) was installed in the centre of each testing unit. The traps were activated during three intervals between Sunday and Monday from 5 p. m. until 9 a. m. the following day. Towards the end of this first trial, insecticide-free glue traps (Glue-Fly Ribbon Traps® Eurofarm, Bützberg, Switzerland) were set up in each of the testing units. The impact of these protective measures towards productivity (development of weight) as well as the general well-being of the calves (defense mechanisms and fly infestation intensity) was also taken into account during the observations. The insecticide-treated net was made of polyester with a mesh size of 1. 6 x 1. 7 mm and contained encapsulated deltamethrin at an initial concentration of 115 mg/m². The two types of untreated nets used in this study were one black fabric made of polyethylene with an irregular mesh size of 0. 7 to 1. 2 mm and one olive-colored texture with a regular mesh size of less than 1 mm. The untreated nets did not lead to a sustainable reduction of biting midges and other pest insects in the protected testing units. However, the second type of untreated net (mesh size less than 1 mm) resulted in a significant decline in defense mechanisms of the calves in the testing unit that was protected by the netting fence at 1. 80 m height. In the testing unit that was partly protected with the insecticide-treated net, a significant reduction at an average of 73. 6 % (p= 0. 001) of biting midges was observed compared to the control group. Against all expectations, most of the biting midges (47. 7 % {{of the total number of}} insects collected from all testing units) were found in the testing unit that was completelysurrounded by nets. Yet, in the same testing unit a considerable effect on pest insects in general was observed. The ratio of flies was only 6. 5 % of the total number of collected flies. Furthermore, a significantly smaller (p< 0. 0001) infestation of the calves with flies was recorded. It was not verified that the protection with neither treated nor untreated nets had an impact on the calves’ development of weights. During a second trial (from August until October 2009) the insecticide-treated net was set up for the protection of dairy cattle in a stable (intervention group). The entire building excluding two access roads was equipped with a free-standing netting fence at 2. 20 m height. Another stable that was identical in construction and aligned parallel to the intervention stable remained without netting and served as control group. In both pens, three UV light traps were installed in the same position to collect biting midges, and two insecticide-free glue traps were set up to catch pest insects (Muscidae spp.) During the entire observation period, a sustainable effect on the number of biting midges and flies could be examined. The significant reduction of biting midges in the intervention group compared to the control group was at 41. 9 % (p= 0. 0391), the reduction of flies on average 77. 2 % (p= 0. 0039). From June until October 2009, four UV light traps were set up in the close vicinity of the testing units and cattle stables in and outside of the farm premises to monitor the abundance of biting midges at the location Lögow. For the duration of entomologic monitoring from the beginning of June until the end of October 2009, the number of insects caught in the traps outdoors and inside the testing units as well as later in the stables was very small. The highest abundance was examined at the end of June until mid of July 2009. The biocidal effectiveness of the insecticide-treated net was frequently tested in bioassays by using sensitive strains of laboratory insects (Musca domestica) once before the installation of the nets in the field and subsequently on a monthly basis. The interior of the testing box was covered with a sample of the net. After a 10 -second exposure, the paralysis rate of the testing insects was recorded in pre-defined time intervals. The T 50 value (the point of time when 50 % of the testing insects are paralyzed) was used to evaluate the effectivenes of the insecticide. The fly bioassay showed sound and <b>persistent</b> <b>insecticide</b> effectiveness during the entire testing period of five months. Even after one year in the field, the T 50 has slightly more than doubled (9 min) compared to the initial T 50 (4 min). The insecticide-treated net was easy to handle and due to its durability towards weather conditions (wind) it is considered suitable for the field. The chosen mesh size, the insecticide concentration of the examined net as well as the way of installation (free-standing) proved to be effective. Continuous monitoring of the effectiveness of the net in regions with a demonstrably higher abundance of biting midges is necessary to confirm the results that have been achieved up to now. At the same time, the obvious problem of detected and proven insecticide resistance on many cattle farms underlines the necessity of research on insecticide-free nets to fight vectors. Further research should focus on the optimization of these nets on the basis of the results that have been gathered so far...|$|E

40|$|Anubha Goel, Doctor of Philosophy, 2007 Upper Delmarva Peninsula (within the Chesapeake Bay watershed), {{where the}} land use is {{predominantly}} agricultural, {{may be a}} significant source of pesticides (contributors in the declining water quality and bio-diversity of associated wetlands of the Chesapeake Bay) to the region. Although the Peninsula is predicted to be receiving significant inputs of herbicides through atmospheric deposition, the extent of local or regional atmospheric transport and deposition of pesticides to this area is poorly understood. The goal of this research was to determine the atmospheric levels and estimate deposition flux of pesticides in the Upper Delmarva Peninsula. This was accomplished by collecting weekly air samples (n= 271) and event based rain samples (n= 489) from three locations in the region (Dover and Lewes, DE; Cambridge, MD) for the period 2000 - 2003. The samples were analyzed for the presence of 34 pesticides (19 current use (CUPs), 15 historical (HUPs)) and 4 congeners of penta-BDE (PBDEs) using gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Statistically analyzed data was used to evaluate factors impacting phase distribution and the contribution of wet deposition to the levels in Chesapeake Bay. The more <b>persistent</b> <b>insecticides</b> and fungicides occur ubiquitously while application on corn influences herbicide occurrence and levels. Atmospheric CUP levels are driven by regional agricultural activity. CUPs do not exist in equilibrium and local meteorological conditions (like high relative humidity) influence phase distribution. The wet deposition flux of insecticide and fungicide is dependent on the total rainfall amount during the sampling period while timing and frequency relative to application on corn impacts herbicide flux. Levels in rainwater of some pesticides (endosulfans, chlorothalonil, diazinon etc.) were high enough to be of concern for the biota associated with the region's water bodies and associated wetlands and reveals that atmospheric deposition arising out of short range atmospheric transport can result in significant pesticide input to non-target areas. HUP atmospheric levels are lower than in the Great Lakes and are decreasing at a faster rate. This study reveals that spray irrigation of treated wastewater is an unknown source of toxic PBDEs to the atmosphere and can result in elevated levels at locations downwind of the irrigation fiel...|$|R

A strong gradient in lindane concentration was observed, with the highest lindane concentrations in an area located in the northern region.

Consequently, the amounts of chlordecone that could migrate through the environment and contaminate agricultural products need to be controlled. We measured the impact of two composts (5 % weight) on chlordecone sequestration in andosols.

After 3 months of maturation, soil-water and soil-plant transfers were reduced by a factor of from 3 to 10.

The chlordecone uptake of three crops was measured for two types of polluted soils: allophanic and non-allophanic. The uptake is lower for allophanic soils even if their chlordecone content is higher than with non-allophanic soils. The fractal structure of the allophane aggregates was characterized at the nanoscale by small angle X-rays scattering, pore size distribution and transmission electron microscopy. We showed that clay microstructures should be an important physico-chemical factor governing the fate of chlordecone in the environment. Allophanic clays result in two counterintuitive findings: higher contaminant trappings yet lower contaminant availability. We propose that this specific, tortuous structure, along with its associated low accessibility, partly explains the low availability of chlordecone confined in allophanic soils. Capsule The fractal and tortuous microstructure of allophane clay favours the chlordecone retention in soils and disfavours the crop uptake. Highlights ? Allophanic soils are highly polluted but less contaminant for cultivated vegetables. ? SAXS and TEM show the fractal structure of allophane aggregates at the nanoscale. ?

We developed a new method to predict ecological vulnerability in wildlife using autecological information. The analysis results in an ordinal ranking of vulnerable species. The method was applied to six representative contaminants: copper and zinc (essential metals, low to medium toxicity), cadmium (nonessential metal, high toxicity), DDT (persistent organic pesticide, high toxicity), chlorpyrifos (<b>persistent</b> organophosphate <b>insecticide,</b> high toxicity), and ivermectin (persistent veterinary pharmaceutical, low to medium toxicity). High vulnerability to the essential metals copper and zinc was correlated with soil and sediment habitat preference of a species and with r-strategy (opportunistic strategy suited for unstable environments). Increased vulnerability to the bioaccumulating substances cadmium and DDT was correlated with higher position of a species in the food web and with life span and K-strategy (equilibrium strategy suited for stable environments). Vulnerability to chlorpyrifos and ivermectin was high for species with a preference for soil habitats. The ecological vulnerability analysis has potential to further our abilities in risk assessmen...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the immense}} utility of DDT for vector control its {{usefulness}} is prejudiced by its {{stability in the}} environment and by the low rate at which it can be degraded biologically. Metabolic studies in insects, in mice, and in a model ecosystem with several food chains have shown that DDT analogues with substituent groups readily attacked by multifunction oxidases undergo a substantial degree of biological degradation and {{do not appear to}} be stored readily in animal tissues or concentrated in food chains. Detailed metabolic pathways have been worked out and it is clear that comparative biochemistry can be used to develop DDT analogues that are adequately persistent yet biodegradable. A number of new DDT analogues have been evaluated for insecticidal activity against flies and mosquitos and for their potential usefulness as safe, <b>persistent,</b> and biodegradable <b>insecticides...</b>|$|R
40|$|Established {{risk factors}} for breast cancer explain breast cancer risk only partially. Hence, there has been {{interest}} in evaluating what role environmental chemicals, especially those with evidence of being hormonally active agents, play in breast cancer risk. Organochlorine pesticides have received the most attention because of their persistence in the environment, ability to concentrate up the food chain, continued detection in the food supply and breast milk, and ability to be stored in the adipose tissue of animals and humans. Although several early descriptive studies and a cohort study identified a strong positive association with breast cancer risk and adipose or blood levels of the organochlorine pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and/or its metabolite dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), most of the more recent case [...] control and nested case [...] control studies have not supported this association. In this review I discuss these findings and explore how exposure to different forms of DDT with varying estrogenicities may have affected {{the results of these}} studies. I also address how other factors influence the interpretation of the studies on DDT, DDE, and breast cancer risk. These include the effect of analytic methods, dietary factors, menopausal status, use of different types of control populations, lactation history, estrogen receptor status, ethnic/racial subgroups, breast tumor characteristics, and polymorphisms. I also discuss the emerging research on whether serum levels of the <b>persistent</b> organochlorine <b>insecticide</b> dieldrin are related to breast cancer risk in Danish and American women.

40|$|International audienceBackground Chlordecone is a <b>persistent</b> {{organochlorine}} <b>insecticide</b> with well-defined estrogenic properties. It was intensively {{used in the}} French West Indies until 1993 {{to control}} the banana root borer. Because of the long-term contamination of soils and water, the population is currently exposed to chlordecone through food consumption. Chlordecone {{has been found in}} the blood of pregnant women and in cord blood. It {{has been shown to be}} an endocrine-disrupting chemical and exposure during pregnancy may affect fetal growth. Objectives The objective of our study was to examine the association between prenatal exposure to chlordecone and fetal growth based on the TIMOUN birth cohort conducted in Guadeloupe, with a focus on the potential modification of this relationship by maternal body mass index (BMI) and gestational weight gain (GWG). Methods Chlordecone was determined in cord plasma at birth in 593 babies. Birth weight was the indicator of fetal growth. Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and GWG were determined. Adherence to GWG recommendations of the US Institute of Medicine based on maternal pre-pregnancy BMI was assessed. Birth weight was analyzed relative to cord blood chlordecone levels using linear and non-linear regression models. Results Overall chlordecone in cord blood was not associated with birth weight, but we found an interaction between chlordecone exposure with GWG and adherence to GWG recommendations. After stratification by GWG, we found a significant U-shaped association between birth weight and chlordecone exposure, within the upper quartiles of GWG or excessive GWG. Conclusion Chlordecone exposure may affect fetal growth, particularly when excessive GWG is present. © 2016 Elsevier Inc...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCONTEXT: Chlordecone, an {{environmentally}} <b>persistent</b> organochlorine <b>insecticide</b> used intensively in banana {{culture in the}} French West Indies until 1993, has permanently polluted soils and contaminated foodstuffs. Consumption of contaminated food is {{the main source of}} exposure nowadays. We sought to identify main contributors to blood chlordecone concentration (BCC) and to validate an exposure indicator based on food intakes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) completed by a sample of 194 pregnant women to estimate their dietary exposure to chlordecone and compared it to blood levels. In a first approach, chlordecone daily intake was estimated as the product of daily eaten quantity of 214 foodstuffs, multiplied by their chlordecone content, and summed over all items. We then predicted individual blood chlordecone concentration with empirical weight regression models based on frequency of food consumption, and without contamination data. RESULTS: Among the 191 subjects who had BCC determination, 146 (76 %) had detectable values and mean BCC was 0. 86 ng/mL (range < LOD- 13. 2). Mean per capita dietary intake of chlordecone was estimated at 3. 3 microg/day (range: 0. 1 - 22. 2). Blood chlordecone levels were significantly correlated with food exposure predicted from the empirical weight models (r= 0. 47, p< 0. 0001) and, to a lesser extent, with chlordecone intake estimated from food consumption and food contamination data (r= 0. 20, p= 0. 007). Main contributors to chlordecone exposure included seafood, root vegetables, and Cucurbitaceous. CONCLUSION: These results show that the Timoun FFQ provides valid estimates of chlordecone exposure. Estimates from empirical weight models correlated better with blood levels of chlordecone than did estimates from the dietary intake assessment...|$|R
40|$|The highly <b>persistent</b> cyclodiene (organochlorine) <b>insecticides</b> (aldrin, dieldrin, chlordane and heptachlor), {{the main}} termiticides used in Australia for 30 years, were {{withdrawn}} from use {{in most of}} Australia on 30 June 1995. Alternative strategies for subterranean termite management in buildings and other structures had been under development, well before this withdrawal. Here we focus on these and subsequent developments in subterranean termite management, relevant to Queensland, including a national survey, relevant building regulations, approvals {{and changes in the}} Australian Standards on termite management. Developments including a national training and competency-based-licensing system for pest managers, insurance of dwellings against termite damage and several alternative termite management strategies are discussed. An integrated approach to termite management is the likely direction for the future in Australia, minimising reliance on chemical sprays and drenches. There will be an increased need for physical barriers in improved building design and reliable preventative and remedial treatments involving bait technology. The need for research on termite biology and, in particular, foraging behavior is emphasized yet again...|$|R
5000|$|The name Chlordane, or chlordan, is {{commonly}} used as both a specific chemical (with trans-and cis- isomers) and as a mixture of compounds (main components- heptachlor, chlordane, and nonachlor). This mixture, more specifically called technical chlordane, was first produced in the 1940s by Julius Hyman. Technical chlordane development was by chance, during a search for possible uses of a by-product of synthetic rubber manufacturing. By chlorinating this by-product, <b>persistent</b> and potent <b>insecticides</b> were easily and cheaply produced. The chlorine atoms, 7 {{in the case of}} heptachlor and 8 in chlordane, and 9 in the case of nonachlor, surround and stabilize the cyclodiene ring and thus these compounds are referred to as cyclodienes. Other members of the cyclodiene family of organochorine insecticides are aldrin and its epoxide, dieldrin, as well as endrin, which is a stereoisomer of dieldrin. These highly chlorinated cyclodienes are both resistant to degradation in the environment and in humans/animals and readily accumulate in lipids (fats) of human/animals.

40|$|International audiencePurpose The Caribbean {{population}} of Guadeloupe {{has one of}} the highest incidence rates of prostate cancer worldwide. In 2008, a population-based cancer registry was set up for the monitoring of cancer incidence in the aftermath of the environmental pollution with chlordecone, a <b>persistent</b> organochlorine <b>insecticide</b> formerly used in banana plantations. We describe the clinical presentation, incidence, mortality and survival of prostate cancer for the period 2008 - 2013. Methods The Guadeloupe cancer registry has been routinely collecting all incident cases of cancer since 2008. We compared age-specific incidence rates between different populations, and calculated incidence and mortality rates standardized to the world population. Kaplan-Meier observed survival and estimated age-standardized net survival were calculated by category for age, PSA level, and Gleason score using the Pohar-Perme method. Results Overall, 3, 295 cases of prostate cancer were recorded. World-standardized incidence and mortality were respectively 184. 1 [177. 8 - 190. 4] and 23. 9 [21. 9 - 25. 7] per 100, 000 person-years. At diagnosis, the mean age of patients was 68 +/- 9. 6 years old and 22 % were aged over 75. Median PSA level was 8. 9 [IQR: 6. 0 - 16. 0] and 13. 6 % of the patients had a Gleason >= 8. Five-year observed and net survivals were, respectively, 79. 6 % [77. 9 - 81. 2] and 90. 7 % [88. 6 - 92. 8]. Conclusion The incidence of prostate cancer in Guadeloupe is among the highest in the world, along with those of the neighboring Caribbean countries and US African-Americans. We observed no decrease in incidence rates, and a decreasing but non-significant trend in mortality rates, which nonetheless remain higher than in high-income countries. Many Genome-Wide Association Studies are conducted to identify genetic markers involved in prostate cancer risk. In the Caribbean, complementary studies on both lifestyle and behavioral factors should highlight potential common risks among populations who share both genetic and environmental characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Chlordecone is a <b>persistent</b> {{organochlorine}} <b>insecticide</b> that, even {{decades after}} its ban, {{poses a threat}} to the environment and human health. Nevertheless, its environmental fate in soils has scarcely been investigated, and elementary data on its degradation and behaviour in soil are lacking. The mineralisation and sorption of chlordecone and the formation of possible metabolites were evaluated in a tropical agricultural andosol. Soil microcosms with two different soil horizons (S-A and S-B) were incubated for 215 days with 14 C-chlordecone. At five different times (1, 33, 88, 150 and 215 days) the extractability of 14 C-chlordecone was analysed. Mineralisation was monitored using 14 CO 2 traps of NaOH. The appearance of metabolites was studied using thin layer and gas chromatography techniques. At the end of the experiment, the water soluble 14 C-activity was 2 % of the remaining 14 C-chlordecone for S-A and 8 % for S-B. Only 12 % of the remaining activity was non extractable and more than 80 % remained extractable with organic solvents. For the first time to our knowledge, a significant mineralisation of chlordecone was measured in a microcosm under aerobic conditions (4. 9 % for S-A and 3. 2 % for S-B of the initial 14 C-activity). The drastically lower emission of 14 CO 2 in sterilised microcosms indicated the biological origin of chlordecone mineralisation in the non-sterilised microcosms. No metabolites could be detected in the soil extracts. The mineralisation rate of chlordecone decreased by one order of magnitude throughout the incubation period. Thus, the chlordecone content in the soil remained large. This study confirms the existence of chlordecone degrading organisms in a tropical andosol. The reasons why their activity is restricted should be elucidated to allow the development of bioremediation approaches. Possible reasons are a heterogeneous distribution a chlordecone between sub-compartments with different microbial activities or a degradation of chlordecone by co-metabolic processes controlled by a limited supply of nutrients...|$|R
50|$|Attempting {{to control}} the cluster fly by {{controlling}} their earthworm host is not recommended or effective since flies may originate {{from more than a}} mile away from the infestation site. Once Pollenia rudis enters a home, {{it is almost impossible to}} kill enough of the flies to fully eradicate them. In order to prevent cluster flies from entering a house, all exterior cracks and openings should be caulked or sealed. This includes (sealing) light fixtures, electrical outlets, windows, and baseboards. <b>Persistent</b> use of <b>insecticides</b> has also been shown to reduce fly numbers if sprayed on the exterior of a home. However, these methods are not guaranteed for preventing infestations. When cluster flies do invade the home, they are extremely difficult to exterminate. Trying to kill the flies with a fly swatter leads to greasy spots on walls and upholstery as well as a lingering smell of buckwheat honey. Once spring arrives the flies will try to leave on their own in order to lay eggs, but many times they enter other living areas of the home instead. Vacuum cleaners and aerosol insecticides may be used to control visible, sluggish flies, but professional extermination is the most reliable method for eliminating an infestation.|$|R
