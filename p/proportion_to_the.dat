5|$|Compsognathus were small, bipedal {{animals with}} long hind legs and longer tails, which they used for balance during locomotion. The forelimbs were {{smaller than the}} hindlimbs and {{featured}} three digits equipped with solid claws suited for grasping prey. Their delicate skulls were narrow and long, with tapered snouts. The skull had five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings), the largest of which was for the orbit (eye socket). The eyes were large in <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rest of the skull.|$|E

Ishbaljir (1709-1788) compared building <b>proportions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>proportions</b> {{of the human body}} in Exquisite Flower Beads, and Agvaanhaidav (1779-1838) described the process of building a Maitreya temple. Agvaanceren (1785-1849) wrote Aahar shaahar (Building and Repairing Temples). Translations of the Kangyur were also used by Mongolian architects.|$|R
5|$|For a given {{topography}} and bathymetry {{the surge}} height is not solely affected by peak wind speed; {{the size of}} the storm also affects the peak surge. With any storm, the area of piled up water can flow out of the storm perimeter, and this escape mechanism is reduced in <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surge force (for the same peak wind speed) when the storm covers more area (storm perimeter length per area is inversely proportional to a circular storm's diameter).|$|E

50|$|Aberlemno 3 has {{different}} <b>proportions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kirkyard Cross-slab, being relatively tall and thin, with parallel sides which have incised decoration (those {{of the other}} cross-slab are plain). The monument's height and decoration on four faces both suggest it is later in date than Aberlemno 2. Its nearest artistic analogies appear to be sculptures from Easter Ross in northern Scotland, notable the Hilton of Cadboll stone (now in the Museum of Scotland), which has a closely similar hunting scene.|$|R

5|$|The bluebuck rock {{paintings}} from the Caledon river valley {{have been attributed}} to Bushmen. They show six antelopes facing a man, and were supposedly inspired by shamanic trance; they may depict a Bushman visiting the spirit-world through a tunnel. The Bushmen possibly believed that the bluebuck had a supernatural potency, like other animals in their environment. The animals in the paintings are similar in <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reedbuck, but the large ears, horns, and lack of a mane rule out species other than the bluebuck.|$|E
5|$|This kiwi {{is highly}} aggressive, and pairs will defend their large territories (49 acres) against other kiwi. Great spotted kiwi are nocturnal, and will sleep {{during the day}} in burrows. At night, they feed on {{invertebrates}} and will also eat plants. Great spotted kiwi breed between June and March. The egg is the largest of all birds in <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> size of the bird. Chicks take 75 to 85 days to hatch, and after hatching, they are abandoned by their parents.|$|E
5|$|By November 1885, Adler had a {{theatrical}} club of his own, the Princes Street Club, No. 3 Princes Street (now Princelet Street, E1), purpose-built, financed by a butcher named David Smith. It seated 300; playing every night except Friday, he was earning about £3 s.10 a week, {{but with a}} fame well out of <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> meagre money.

40|$|Myc {{family members}} play crucial roles in {{regulating}} cell proliferation, size, differentiation, and survival during development. We found that N-myc {{is expressed in}} retinal progenitor cells, where it regulates proliferation in a cell-autonomous manner. In addition, N-myc coordinates {{the growth of the}} retina and eye. Specifically, the retinas of N-myc-deficient mice are hypocellular but are precisely <b>proportioned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> size of the eye. N-myc represses the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p 27 Kip 1 but acts independently of cyclin D 1, the major D-type cyclin in the developing mouse retina. Acute inactivation of N-myc leads to increased expression of p 27 Kip 1, and simultaneous inactivation of p 27 Kip 1 and N-myc rescues the hypocellular phenotype in N-myc-deficient retinas. N-myc is not required for retinal cell fate specification, differentiation, or survival. These data represent the first example of a role for a Myc family member in retinal development and the first characterization of a mouse model in which the hypocellular retina is properly <b>proportioned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other ocular structures. We propose that N-myc lies upstream of the cell cycle machinery in the developing mouse retina and thus coordinates the growth of both the retina and eye through extrinsic cues...|$|R

However, while {{production of the}} film continued, AP Films developed a prototype with a latex mouth to result in more realistic movement of the lips and jaws. However, this animatronic technology proved to be insufficiently advanced and the idea was abandoned. For the later television series Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, a brand-new puppet design of realistic anatomical proportions made its debut appearance when the solenoid of the lip-synch mechanism was relocated from <b>the</b> puppet head <b>to</b> <b>the</b> torso area.|$|R
5|$|Five {{years after}} the {{pioneering}} flight of the Wright brothers on 17 December 1903, Thomas Selfridge became the first fatality of powered flight while flying as a passenger with Orville Wright during {{a demonstration of the}} Wright Model A at Fort Myer, Virginia, on 17 September 1908. Eugène Lefebvre was the first pilot killed in a power airplane in 1909, while the first fatal mid-air collision occurred on 19 June 1912, near Douai, France, killing the pilot of each aircraft. Since the deaths of these early aviation pioneers, the scale of fatal aircraft accidents has increased in <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> size and capacity of airplanes.|$|E
5|$|In April 1903 a {{petition}} objecting to {{the renewal of}} alcohol licences for local inns, signed by 450 people, {{was presented to the}} Brewsters sessions (magistrates court meetings in England where pub licences were renewed or granted). A deputation sent to the session explained that the number of licensed houses was too large in <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> population. In 1917, the cattle market moved from the Higher Bullring to a field near the station. The first cinema was opened in the Victoria Hall in 1918 by Bill Terry and in 1977 the town was twinned with Ploudalmézeau in Brittany, France.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} of diversifying revenues, as three-fourths of revenue gathered was from commerce with Great Britain, Hamilton attempted once again during his Report on Public Credit when presenting it in 1790 to implement an excise tax both imported and domestic spirits. The taxation rate was graduated in <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> whiskey proof, and Hamilton intended to equalize {{the tax burden}} on imported spirits with imported and domestic liquor. In lieu of the excise on production citizens could pay 60 cents by the gallon of dispensing capacity, along with an exemption on small stills used exclusively for domestic consumption. He realized the loathing that the tax would receive in rural areas, but thought of the taxing of spirits more reasonable than land taxes.|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} Table  5, the {{observed}} binders {{accounted for about}} 50  % of the total volume fraction, so the agglomerated binders {{are present in the}} briquettes in similar <b>proportions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dispersed binders. Friction between the binder and the polishing machine can cause some binder to fall off during preparation of the polished sections. Agglomerated binders fall out more easily than dispersed binders. Greater amounts of the agglomerated binders fall out with amount  increasing of binder added, which accounts for the decreasing proportion of observed binder as the additive increases.|$|R
5|$|Local {{churches were}} further {{organized}} into geographically defined presbyteries. A presbytery was {{a convention of}} all ministers within its jurisdiction and one ruling elder chosen by each session. Collegiate churches were entitled to be represented by two or more ruling elders in <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> number of its pastors. Presbyteries were responsible for examining, licensing and ordaining candidates to the ministry, as well as judging and removing ministers. They were also responsible for resolving doctrinal or disciplinary questions and also functioned as courts of appeal from sessions. An executive commission was appointed to more efficiently manage the presbytery's work, and judicial cases were referred to a judicial commission.|$|E
5|$|Persons with aphthous {{stomatitis}} have no detectable systemic {{symptoms or}} signs (i.e., outside the mouth). Generally, symptoms may include prodromal sensations such as burning, itching, or stinging, which may precede {{the appearance of}} any lesion by some hours; and pain, which is often out of <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> extent of the ulceration and is worsened by physical contact, especially with certain foods and drinks (e.g., if they are acidic). Pain is worst in the days immediately following the initial formation of the ulcer, and then recedes as healing progresses. If there are lesions on the tongue, speaking and chewing can be uncomfortable, and ulcers on the soft palate, back of the throat, or esophagus can cause painful swallowing. Signs are limited to the lesions themselves.|$|E
5|$|The French {{approach}} to funding memorials also relied mainly on voluntary fundraising, but featured {{a greater role}} for the state. A law passed in 1919 provided for a subsidy from central government to local authorities to assist in building memorials; the money was distributed in <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> number of local citizens {{who had died in}} the war. Nonetheless the largest French projects, such as the Ossuary of Douaumont, were still paid for mostly through private fund raising across France and the international community: it could take many years to raise the sums required. The Ossuary cost 15 m francs to build; {{at the other end of}} the scale, more modest urban memorials cost around 300,000 francs.|$|E

25|$|Naturals in {{that table}} {{are not the}} {{alphabetic}} series A to G without sharps and flats: Naturals are reciprocals of terms in the Harmonic series (mathematics), which are in practice multiples of a fundamental frequency. This may be derived by proceeding with the principle that historically gives the Pythagorean diatonic and chromatic scales, stacking perfect fifths with 3:2 frequency proportions (C-G-D-A-E). Considering the anhemitonic scale as a subset of a just diatonic scale, it is tuned thus: 20:24:27:30:36 (A-C-D-E-G = 5/3-1/1-9/8-5/4-3/2). Assigning precise frequency <b>proportions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pentatonic scales of most cultures is problematic as tuning may be variable.|$|R

After spending {{the rest of the year}} in reserve, receiving new supplies and equipment, the corps was transferred to the southern front in southwestern Russia to fight in the Ostrogozhsk–Rossosh Offensive during January 1943, in which it played a key role by forming part of the forces that encircled thousands of Axis troops on the Middle Don River.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosperity}} stimulated {{a building}} boom that was underway by the mid-1830s, {{with the building}} {{of some of the}} most elaborate structures the city had seen up to that point. This was cut short in part by the Panic of 1837 and yellow fever epidemics. The waterfront was developed with wharves, terminal facilities, and fireproof brick warehouses. The exports of cotton grew in <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> amounts being produced in the Black Belt; by 1840 Mobile was second only to New Orleans in cotton exports in the nation.|$|E
5|$|This {{decompression}} {{model was}} developed by D.E. Yount {{and others at the}} University of Hawaii to model laboratory observations of bubble formation and growth in both inanimate and in vivo systems exposed to pressure variations. It presumes that microscopic bubble nuclei always exist in aqueous media, including living tissues. These bubble nuclei are spherical gas phases that are small enough to remain in suspension yet strong enough to resist collapse, their stability being provided by an elastic surface layer consisting of surface-active molecules with variable gas permeability. These skins resist the effect of surface tension, as surface tension tends to collapse a small bubble by raising internal pressure above ambient so that the partial pressure gradient favours diffusion out of the bubble in inverse <b>proportion</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> radius of the surface.|$|E
