40|$|The {{request of}} the Internet users enjoying privacy during their e-activities enforces the Internet society to develop {{techniques}} which offer privacy to the Internet users, known as Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs). Among the Internet users, there are attackers who desire {{more than anything else}} to enjoy privacy during their malicious actions, and a <b>PET</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> they <b>were</b> looking for. Thus, although a PET should offer privacy to the internet users, proper techniques should also be employed in order to help the victims during the investigation procedure and unveil the identification of the attackers. The paper summarizes the current design issues of PETs and introduces additional issues in order to offer forensic investigation services. To {{the best of our knowledge}} this is the first attempt which it proves (the obvious) that the existing PETs do not meet accountability requirements. By knowing explicitly the reasons the <b>PETs</b> <b>are</b> inefficient offering accountability, it is the most appropriate way to make PETs offering higher level of accountability without decreasing the level of the privacy offered...|$|R

40|$|Issue: <b>PET</b> <b>is</b> an {{extremely}} hygroscopic thermoplastic, {{in that it}} readily absorbs moisture from the atmosphere. The presence of minute amounts of moisture will hydrolyze PET in the melt phase, severely reducing molecular weight. As a result, mechanical properties of PET decrease and end-product quality <b>is</b> compromised. Therefore, <b>PET</b> must <b>be</b> thoroughly dry just prior to melt processing, and in some cases, recycled PET {{may have to be}} crystallized prior to drying. Background: Unlike the other major packaging resins (e. g., polyolefins, polystyrene, and PVC), <b>PET</b> <b>is</b> produced by a condensation reaction. Various starting materials are used and reacted in a series of steps to produce PET. This reaction, which also produces water, is reversible. Therefore, when undried <b>PET</b> <b>is</b> melted, the resin and water chemically react. Hydrolysis occurs and key mechanical properties of the <b>PET</b> <b>are</b> reduced. This hydrolysis reaction also changes PET melt viscosity and crystallization rate, making it very difficult to process into a quality end product. <b>PET</b> <b>is</b> a "semi-crystalline " thermoplastic, meaning it has both crystalline and amorphous regions within its molecular structure. The crystalline portion develops where the molecules can align themselves in a very compact linear structure. Otherwise, the molecules are set in a random o...|$|R
