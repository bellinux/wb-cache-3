The scene in which Wendy discovers her husband's work (consisting only of a simple proverb: [...] "all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy" [...] repeatedly typed on numerous pages) was shot with different proverbs in at least five languages (English, French, Spanish, Italian and German). Nevertheless, most DVD releases show the English version, disregarding the dub language.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1918 {{watercolor}} painting Einst dem Grau der Nacht enttaucht, a compositional implemented poem, possible {{written by}} Klee, he incorporated letters in small, {{in terms of}} color separated squares, cutting off the first verse from the second one with silver paper. At {{the top of the}} cardboard, which carries the picture, the verses are inscribed in manuscript form. Here, Klee did not lean on Delaunay's colors, but on Marc's, although the <b>picture</b> <b>content</b> of both painters does not correspond with each other. Herwarth Walden, Klee's art dealer, saw in them a [...] "Wachablösung" [...] (changing of the guard) of his art. Since 1919 he often used oil colors, with which he combined watercolors and colored pencil. The Villa R (Kunstmuseum Basel) from 1919 unites visible realities such as sun, moon, mountains, trees and architectures, as well as surreal pledges and sentiment readings.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The mass of {{multimedia}} data produced annually in hospitals are measured in terabytes; {{the need to}} manage this gigantic information mass becomes quickly extremely crucial. The actual management information systems of medical pictures present some limits like their capacities to answer {{the needs of the}} users. These limits are {{due to the fact that}} these systems don't take in consideration the semantic <b>content</b> of the <b>pictures.</b> <b>Content</b> research aims to pass this problem. One of the possible means consists in using description criteria of the <b>picture</b> semantic <b>content</b> for being able to reuse it. These criteria are known in the medical knowledge domain. We think that the use of an enterprise memory for managing this knowledge would be able to satisfy this need. We demonstrate our subjects by the realization of a prototype named "MECIM "...|$|R

50|$|A motion <b>picture</b> <b>content</b> {{rating system}} is {{designated}} to classify films {{with regard to}} suitability for audiences in terms of issues such as sex, violence, substance abuse, profanity, impudence or other types of mature content. A particular issued rating can be called a certification, classification, certificate or rating. Ratings typically carry age recommendations in an advisory or restrictive capacity, and are often given in lieu of censorship. In some jurisdictions the legal obligation of administering the rating may be imposed on movie theaters.|$|E
50|$|The AGC circuit was problematic. First-generation AGC merely {{detected}} the average {{value of the}} transmitted signal; however, due to the positively modulated carrier, peak power represented peak white - not guaranteed to be present. Thus for a completely black picture, the AGC circuit would increase the RF gain to restore the average carrier amplitude. The result was a screen that was not black but mid-grey. In fact, the total light output of early TV sets was practically constant regardless of the <b>picture</b> <b>content.</b>|$|E
50|$|Another {{advantage}} of negative modulation is that, since the synchronizing pulses represent maximum carrier power, {{it is relatively}} easy to arrange the receiver automatic gain control to only operate during sync pulses and thus get a constant amplitude video signal to drive the rest of the TV set. This was not possible for many years with positive modulation as the peak carrier power varied depending on <b>picture</b> <b>content.</b> Modern digital processing circuits have achieved a similar effect but using the front porch of the video signal.|$|E

50|$|Premiere is {{recognized}} as the first company to successfully design, build and operate mezzanine-less multiplexes without traditional projection booths, by incorporating the digital projectors directly into the theatre architecture.

Motion <b>picture</b> <b>content</b> is delivered to Premiere Cinemas on hard drives or via satellite and stored on its library management servers, where it is managed and transmitted to the auditoriums throughout the complex.|$|E
