25|$|Biocides are {{chemical}} substances that deter the microorganisms responsible for biofouling. The {{chemical substances}} {{are incorporated into}} an anti-fouling surface coating, typically through physical adsorption or through chemical modification of the surface. Biofouling occurs on surfaces after formation of a biofilm. The biofilm creates a surface onto which successively larger microorganisms can attach. In marine environments this buildup usually concludes with barnacle attachment. The biocides often target the microorganisms that create the initial biofilm, typically bacteria. Once dead, {{they are unable to}} spread and can detach. Other biocides are toxic to larger organisms in biofouling, such as the fungi and algae. The most commonly used biocide, and anti-fouling agent, is the tributyltin moiety (TBT). It is toxic to both microorganisms and larger aquatic organisms. Biocides are also added to <b>pool</b> <b>water,</b> drinking water, and liquid lines for cooling electronics to control biological growth.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Swimming pool {{disinfectants}} and disinfection by-products (DBPs) {{have been}} linked to human health effects, including asthma and bladder cancer, but no studies have provided a comprehensive identification of DBPs in the water and related that to mutagenicity. OBJECTIVES: We performed a comprehensive identification of DBPs and disinfectant species in waters from public swimming pools in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, that disinfect with either chlorine or bromine, and we determined the mutagenicity of the waters to compare to the analytical results. METHODS: We used gas chromatography (GC) /mass spectrometry (MS) to measure THMs in water and GC with electron capture detection (ECD) for air, low and high resolution GC/MS to comprehensively identify DBPs, photometry to measure disinfectant species (free chlorine, monochloroamine, dichloramine, and trichloramine) in the waters, and an ion chromatography method to measure trichloramine in air. We assessed mutagenicity in the Salmonella mutagenicity assay. RESULTS: We identified more than 100 DBPs, including many nitrogen-containing DBPs that were likely formed from nitrogen-containing precursors from human inputs, such as urine, sweat, and skin cells. Many DBPs were new and have not been reported previously in either swimming <b>pool</b> or drinking <b>waters.</b> Bromoform levels were greater in the brominated vs. chlorinated <b>pool</b> <b>waters,</b> but many brominated DBPs were also identified in the chlorinated <b>waters.</b> The <b>pool</b> <b>waters</b> were mutagenic at levels similar to that of drinking water (~ 1200 revertants/L-eq in strain TA 100 -S 9 mix). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified many new DBPs not identified previously in swimming <b>pool</b> or drinking <b>water</b> and found that swimming <b>pool</b> <b>waters</b> are as mutagenic as typical drinking waters...|$|R
