The demodulation eficiency {{is found}} to be independent of the optical injection level in the steady state. However, the optical injection level is important in determining the dynamic response. There exists an optimum optical injection rate to achieve the highest demodulation speed.

40|$|Active interferometers use amplifying {{elements}} for beam splitting and recombination. We experimentally implement such a device by using spin exchange in a Bose-Einstein condensate. The two interferometry modes are initially empty spin states that get spontaneously populated {{in the process}} of parametric amplification.

Finally, a matched second period of spin exchange is performed that nonlinearly amplifies the output signal and maps the phase onto readily detectable first moments. Depending on the accumulated phase this nonlinear readout can reverse the initial dynamics and deamplify the entangled state back to empty spin states.

The radar leverages {{commercial}} FM radio broadcasts (∼ 100 MHz) for illumination and low-cost commercial software radio components to sample the RF signal. Common targets include Bragg scatter off E-region turbulence, meteor wakes, and local aircraft [4]. In ordinary operation the radar samples two signals with receivers separated by 150 km. A single an-tenna at the University of Washington (UW) records the FM waveform from local commercial transmitters. The scattered signal is sampled at Manastash Ridge Observatory (MRO). These two signals are combined to produce range-doppler images through a cross-ambiguity calculation. This mode has run nearly contin-uously for seven years, producing new data every four minutes in the standard surveillance mode. During magnetospheric storms, the system can absorb several days of nearly continuous samples.

40|$|Quantum walks provide simple {{models of}} various {{fundamental}} processes. It is pivotal {{to know when}} the dynamics underlying a walk lead to quantum advantages just by examining its statistics. A walk with many indistinguishable particles and measurements of non-classical multi-particle correlations is likely to reveal the quantum nature. The number of elements $O(n) $ in a setup realizing walks grows with their length or spread $n$. We introduce {{the concept of a}} quantum leap, a process which can be achieved with fewer or complementary resources and which in a single step simulates another long process. The process and its leap are described by the same Hamiltonian but, the latter parametrizes the evolution with a tunable parameter of a setup. In the case of walks, a leap immediately gives a probability distribution which results only after many steps. This may be appealing for simulation of processes which are lengthy or require dynamical control. We discuss a leap based on the multi-particle Hong [...] Ou [...] Mandel interference, an inherently quantum phenomenon.

The principal limitation of the laser gyroscope sensitivity is the frequency lock-in effect, caused by residual backscattering in the cavity [4].
