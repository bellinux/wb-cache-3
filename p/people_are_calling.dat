You let this fellow Miller run after you. In my estimation Miller is not to be compared to Clarke, and judging from the warm greetings I saw Clarke receive this morning, {{there are a number of}} folk who agree with me. Not that I am praising Clarke. I simply say this because to Bessie, to Jack, to everyone, your act is incomprehensible. <b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>calling</b> you a flirt and saying that they would prefer some country manners." ...|$|E
