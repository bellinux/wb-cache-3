Individuals with ORS may present to dermatologists, gastroentrologists, otolaryngologists, dentists, <b>proctologists,</b> and gynecologists. Despite the absence of any clinically detectable odor, physicians and surgeons may embark on unnecessary investigations (e.g. gastroscopy), and treatments, including surgery such as thoracic sympathectomy, tonsillectomy, etc. Such treatments generally have no long-term effect on the individual's belief in an odor symptom.

40|$|Introduction :The {{dermatologic}} pathologies of the {{pelvic floor}} organs are mostly focused on lesions observed {{not only by}} the dermatologist but also by various specialists :proctologists, urologists, and gynaecologists. Sometimes located to one organ, these lesions can be multifocal or related to inflammatory, infectious, neoplastic or premalignant underlying diseases. The abundant data and images imposed us to separate this review into two parts; the systemic diseases will be the subject of a further publication. Aim :An efficient management of such lesions calls for a better collaboration between the specialists within the field of perineology. <b>Proctologists</b> and gynaecologists are the first concerned in their technical and clinical approach. For the different pathologies a therapeutic model is proposed. Diagnostic approach :Images of the various lesions are contributive to a differential diagnosis which can be assessed by histological and serological data whenever necessary. The image references are also helpful to appreciate the healing status. Conclusion :A correct classification of the different patterns with additional data (from serology and/or histology), is of utmost value for a correct diagnosis. The perineal disciplines are on the first line for this approach and have a lot to gain of collaboration but finally the healing status will have to be confirmed by the dermatologist.

40|$|This is {{the era of}} fast foods. Irregularity in food timing, {{improper}} diet, {{and mental}} stress coupled with a sedentary life disturb the digestive system resulting in increased incidence of hemorrhoids. In the present report, we present two cases of intero-external hemorrhoids. Case 1 : A 30 -year old young male approached with intero-external hemorrhoid at 11 O′clock position as a primary. Case 2 : A 41 -year-old female visited with second degree intero-external hemorrhoid at 11 O′clock position. Hemorrhoids present in these patients {{can be considered as}} Kaphaja Arṣa. These cases were diagnosed by per rectal digital and proctoscopic examinations by ayurvedic <b>proctologists.</b> In both cases, application of Jîmūtaka Lepa was done under local anesthesia administered using lignocaine 2 % with adrenaline. This was followed by manual anal dilatation. Jîmūtaka Lepa was applied to the internal hemorrhoids (Arṣa). Changes were observed in the form of edema, ulcer in 3 - 4 days and sloughing out of the pile mass up to 5 - 7 days. Subsequently fibrosis of hemorrhoidal masses started after 7 days. Jîmūtaka Lepa shows a significant effect in obliterating the hemorrhoidal mass within a month of application. The patients were followed-up regularly with proctoscopic examination in each visit and did not reveal any evidence of recurrence of the hemorrhoids...|$|R
40|$|Introduction:Anal condylomata acuminata was a {{well-known}} disease {{in ancient times}} {{but in recent years}} there has been a rapidly increasing number of people who suffer from this disease. The main cause of this disease is infection of human papilloma virus (HPV) which occurs through sexual contact. Currently there are three different ways to treat anal condylomata. Small changes of anal condylomata can be treated with local therapeutic agents, but the best results of treatment of extensive changes are obtained by surgical techniques. Material/Methods:The study group consisted of 30 patients with diagnosed extensive anal condylomata who underwent surgery in Mikolaj Pirogow High Specialized Hospital in Lodz. The survey was conducted from 2007 to 2011. Patients had been directed to the surgical ward by general surgeons and practitioners, <b>proctologists</b> and urologists. The diagnosis was made after proctological assessment in the knee-chest position. Results:All patients underwent surgery and had complete macroscopic electroexcision of anal condylomata. In the research group there was no mortality. Postoperative complications occurred in 4 (13. 3 � 20 patients – postoperative bleeding. Strong pain was present in 14 (46. 7 � 20 patients but only in the postoperative period. During postoperative follow-up there was no observed infection in the anal region or recurrence of disease. In the operated group there were no observed cosmetic deformations of the anus and/or the anal canal, narrow anal canal or functional fecal incontinence symptoms. Conclusions:Surgical treatment of anal condylomata is an effective and safe method for the patient. In our research there were no serious postoperative complications or recurrence of the disease during the follow-up period...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: External acuminata condylomata (EAC) {{are among}} the most common sexually {{transmitted}} diseases. Although it is understood that low-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes 6 and 11 are associated with EAC, there have only been a few, small, published studies reporting the genotype-specific prevalence of HPV. The objective of our study was to assess the prevalence of HPV genotypes for a large number of cases involving both men and women and to evaluate the potential benefit of a quadrivalent (genotypes 6, 11, 16, and 18) HPV vaccine in France. METHODS: A total of 256 women and 260 men who presented with EAC to French gynecologists, dermatologists, and <b>proctologists</b> were prospectively recruited during the period January through April 2007. Specimens were collected with a cytobrush, and the HPV genotype was determined using the INNO-LiPA assay (Innogenetics), which detects 24 HPV genotypes. RESULTS: Four hundred twenty-three beta-globin-positive samples could be analyzed. The median age of patients was 30 years (range, 18 - 72 years). The overall prevalence of HPV DNA in patients with EAC was 99 % (33 % of patients were coinfected with another pathogen). Low-risk genotypes predominated, with a prevalence of 89 %. The most prevalent genotypes were 6 (69 %) and 11 (16 %), followed by 16 (9 %), 51 (8 %), 52 (7 %), 66 (6 %) 53 (5 %), 31 (3 %), and 18 (3 %). The cumulative prevalence of genotypes 6 and 11 was 83 %, and the cumulative prevalence of genotypes 6, 11, 16, and 18 was 88 %. CONCLUSIONS: This study is, to our knowledge, the first large, multicenter survey to provide solid data on HPV genotype distribution among patients with EAC. Our results provide strong evidence that, in France, the most prevalent HPV genotypes in persons with EAC are 6 and 11. Because of its 99 % efficacy for the prevention of EAC and a vaccine coverage of 100 %, the quadrivalent HPV vaccine could prevent 62 %- 87 % of EAC cases in France...|$|R
