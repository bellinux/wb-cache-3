The <b>yard</b> <b>foreman</b> gets an attack of conscience and rows out to stop the Indian Girl from heading to sea and death; Bernick's son is brought back safely by his mother; and Bernick addresses the community, tells them most of the truth and gets away with it. His wife greets the news that he only married her for money as a sign there is now hope for their marriage.|$|R

25|$|<b>Passenger</b> <b>yards</b> are at Long Branch and Bay Head. Long Branch Yard {{is fully}} electrified, and mostly interlocked. Bay Head {{contains}} a large balloon (circular looping) track where entire trains can reverse direction without backing up or uncoupling the locomotive, and obviating {{the need for}} a turntable. It remains in service, even though push-pull operation has eliminated the need for turning of trains. Bay Head Yard has no interlocking; all switches are hand-operated. A yard and sidings formerly existed at South Amboy, dating back to when electrification ended there, but have been removed; trains terminating at South Amboy can be bypassed by using the other track, as the new station has a single island platform.|$|R
50|$|This mixture only needs a spark {{to explode}} {{and it gets}} one when Tønnesen {{falls in love with}} Dina Dorf, a young girl who is the {{daughter}} of the actress involved in the scandal of 15 years ago and who now lives as a charity case in the Bernick household. He demands that Bernick tell the girl the truth. Bernick refuses. Tønnesen says he will go back to the US to clear up his affairs and then come back to town to marry Dina. Bernick sees his chance to get out of his mess. His yard is repairing an American ship, The Indian Girl, which is dangerously unseaworthy. He orders his <b>yard</b> <b>foreman</b> to finish the work by the next day, even if it means sending the ship and its crew to certain death because he wants Tønnesen to die on board. That way he will be free of any danger in the future. Things do not work out like that. Tønnesen runs off with Dina on board another ship which is safe, leaving word that he will be back. And Bernick's young son stows away on the Indian Girl, seemingly heading for certain death.|$|R

40|$|Cattle feedyards in Nebraska were {{surveyed}} in April 2004 to determine costs of labor for various production and administrative employees. Fifty-nine feedyards, {{with an average}} size of 9, 473 head, provided levels of salaries, benefits and bonuses paid to their employees, {{and the number of}} employees in several job-function categories. Results of the survey indicate that the average total compensation (salary, benefits, and bonuses) for feedyard managers was more than $ 66, 000 per year, but it varied substantially by feedyard size. Total compensation to other supervisor categories of labor, including assistant manager, <b>yard</b> <b>foreman,</b> mill foreman, and maintenance foreman, averaged in the $ 40, 000 to $ 50, 000 range. Production labor categories, such as mill operators, feedtruck drivers, cowboys, and maintenance personnel, typically received from $ 30, 000 to $ 40, 000 per year compensation. According to the feedyard survey respondents, most employees are provided health insurance, life insurance, and retirement plan benefits. Feedyard labor costs have increased approximately 5 percent per year across all labor categories since the last feedyard labor cost survey in 1999. Some categories of workers, including mill foreman and operators and maintenance foreman, saw even larger increases. Much of the increase in total compensation {{in recent years has been}} driven by increasing cost of providing benefits. This paper reports both the results of the 2004 labor cost survey and provides a summary of previous surveys conducted by University of Nebraska and Nebraska Cattlemen. Overall, feedyard labor costs have continued to increase in Nebraska, surpassing the rate of inflation...|$|R

Of Davis' 16 carries, 11 were runs to the left side, {{which is where the}} blocking of guard Gene Upshaw, tackle Art Shell and Casper dominated defensive end Jim Marshall and linebacker Wally Hilgenberg. Marshall made no tackles in the game and Hilgenberg made only two. Casper {{finished the}} game with 4 receptions for 70 yards and 1 touchdown.

White recorded 163 total yards, catching 5 passes for 77 yards and 1 touchdown, rushing once for 7 yards, and returning 4 kickoffs for 79 yards. The Raiders won their first Super Bowl and according to Brown, winning Super Bowl XI [...] "made up for the other Raiders who came before and didn’t have a chance to participate on a winning Super Bowl team. This victory meant not only a lot to me, it meant a lot to the entire Raider organization." [...] The win was particularly satisfying for Brown, who scored a Super Bowl touchdown and earned his first championship ring after 14 years of professional football.|$|R

2500|$|To {{allow for}} the {{construction}} of the Northwest Extension, which started in 1978, the Red Line was extended temporarily to Harvard–Brattle over former yard and storage tracks on March 24, 1979. This allowed for bus transfers to be provided. The Harvard Bus Tunnel was closed temporarily at the time. On January 31, 1981, the original Harvard station was permanently closed, as its demolition was required. To replace it, a temporary station at Harvard–Holyoke was built across the tracks. The two temporary stations were closed on September 2, 1983 in preparation for the opening of the new Harvard station. On September 6, 1983, the new station at Harvard opened, with trains changing direction at Davis Square without carrying <b>passengers.</b> Eliot <b>Yard</b> was demolished: Harvard's Kennedy School of Government now sits inside its retaining walls.|$|R
