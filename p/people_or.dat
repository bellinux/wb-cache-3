5|$|As {{a result}} of {{increased}} sales of hybrid electric vehicles in several countries, {{some members of the}} blind community have raised concerns about the noise reduction when those vehicles operate in all-electric mode, as blind <b>people</b> <b>or</b> the visually impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets and feel quiet hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard. Although a 2009 study found no statistically significant difference in pedestrian crashes involving quiet hybrid vehicles when compared to noisier vehicles when both types of vehicles were travelling in a straight line, it found a doubling of hybrid vehicle pedestrian crashes when reversing or parking etc. at slow speeds.|$|E

The number of people identifying as having Moriori descents increased from 105 in 1991 to 945 in 2006, but decreased to 738 in 2013.|$|E
