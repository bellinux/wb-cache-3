25|$|The {{inaugural meeting}} of the NPAFC {{was held at the}} Ottawa Conference Centre in Ottawa, Canada on 24 February 1993, and delegates from Canada, Japan, Russian Federation, and United States of America participated. In {{accordance}} with the Convention, the NPAFC adopted rules of procedure, financial rules, and established an organizational structure for the Commission. The Canadian delegation offered to house the Secretariat at the University of British Columbia free of cost, which the Commission accepted. To aid in the transition from INPFC to NPAFC, the Commission decided INPFC funds be used to complete any outstanding INPFC projects and help fund initial operating costs of the NPAFC. The inaugural meeting also decided on the first <b>provisional</b> <b>budget</b> and selected an interim President & Vice-President on ex officio basis until the First Annual Meeting in November, 1993. Finally, a logo committee was created to design the first NPAFC logo which was selected at the First Annual Meeting in Vancouver, Canada. The First President and Vice-President took office 1 November 1993.|$|E
6000|$|The finance of 1854 offered {{nothing more}} {{original}} or ingenious than bluntly doubling {{the income tax}} (from seven pence to fourteen pence), and raising the duties on spirits, sugar, and malt. The draught was administered in two doses, first in a <b>provisional</b> <b>budget</b> for half a year (March 6), next in a completed scheme two months later. During the interval the chancellor of the exchequer was exposed to much criticism alike from city experts and plain men. The plans of 1853 had, in the main, proved a remarkable success, {{but they were not}} without weak points. Reductions in the duties of customs, excise, and stamps had all been followed by increase in their proceeds. But the succession duty brought in no more than a fraction of the estimated sum--the only time, Mr. Gladstone observes, in which he knew the excellent department concerned to have fallen into such an error. The proposal for conversion proved, under circumstances already described, to have no attraction for the fundholder. The operation on the South Sea stock was worse than a failure, for it made the exchequer, in order to pay off eight millions at par, raise a larger sum at three and a half per cent., and at three per cent. in a stock standing at 87.[331] All this brought loudish complaints from the money market. The men at the clubs talked of the discredit into which Gladstone had fallen as a financier, and even persons not unfriendly to him spoke of him as rash, obstinate, and injudicious. He was declared to have destroyed his prestige and overthrown his authority.[332] ...|$|E

40|$|Optical {{communications}} {{from space}} require an absolute pointing reference. Whereas at near-Earth and even planetary distances out to Mars and Jupiter a laser beacon transmitted from Earth {{can serve as}} such a pointing reference, for farther distances extending to the outer reaches of the solar system, the means for meeting this requirement remains an open issue. We discuss in this article the prospects and consequences of utilizing the Earth image sensed in the long-wave infrared (LWIR) spectral band as a beacon to satisfy the absolute pointing require-ments. We have used data from satellite-based thermal measurements of Earth to synthesize images at various ranges and have shown the centroiding accuracies {{that can be achieved}} with prospective LWIR image sensing arrays. The nonuniform emissivity of Earth causes a mispointing bias error term that exceeds a <b>provisional</b> pointing <b>budget</b> allocation when using simple centroiding algorithms. Other issues related to implementing thermal imaging of Earth from deep space for the purposes of providing a pointing reference are also reported. I...|$|R

Of the remaining workforce, half would be criminal investigators and the other half would focus on analysis and intelligence.

40|$|In October of 1995, the Austrian federal {{government}} {{was not able to}} agree on a budget proposal for 1996; as a result, the coalition government broke up, and general elections were called for December 1995. A <b>provisional</b> <b>budget</b> will be in effect until the late winter or spring of 1996 when it might be possible for the new government to present a new budget proposal. The budget situation has posed serious political problems in a number of Western European countries. In the OECD area, general government gross debt as a percentage of GDP has risen from 41 percent {{at the beginning of the}} 1980 's to about 75 percent in 1995. Net interest payments for public debt as a share of GDP rose from 2 percent to 5 percent. Against this background, the imbalance regarding Austria's public finances is relatively minor: interest payments for public debt amount to 3. 5 percent in 1995; general government gross debt totals 68. 5 percent of GDP.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to look at the {{influence}} of the capacity of human resources, budget planning and budgeting politics on the synchronization between Regional Revenues and Expenditures Budget (APBD) document and General Policy of Regional Revenues and Expenditures Budget (KUA) - <b>Provisional</b> <b>Budget</b> Ceiling Priority (PPAS) document and to test the role of public transparency in moderating the relationship between the capacity of human resources, budget planning, budgeting politics with the synchronization between APBD document and KUA-PPAS document. The population of this study was 123 persons consisting of legislative members and officials/employees who were involved in the preparation of the Work Plan and Budget of 29 Regional Apparatus Working Units and all of them were selected to be the samples for this study by using census sampling method. The data used in this study were primary data obtained through the questionnaires directly distributed to the respondents. The data obtained were analyzed through multiple linear regression tests and interaction test. Hypothesis was simultaneously and partially tested through F test and t test. The result of hypothesis test in this study showed that simultaneously the variables of capacity of human resources, budget planning and budgeting politics had a positive and significant influence on the synchronization between APBD document and KUA-PASS document, and partially, capacity of human resources and budgeting politics had a significant influence on the synchronization between APBD document and KUA-PASS document while budget planning had a negative and signifcant influence. The result of the interaction test showed that public transparency could not moderate the relationship between the capacity of human resources, budget planning and budgeting politics and the synchronization between APBD document and KUA-PASS document.
