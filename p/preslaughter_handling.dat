40|$|The {{physiological}} and behavioural responses of slaughter pigs reared {{in either a}} barren environment or in an enriched environment (larger pens with straw bedding) to <b>preslaughter</b> <b>handling</b> and mixing at transport were studied. Enriched-reared pigs had higher salivary cortisol concentrations in the home pen before and after transport than barren housed pigs, {{but at the end}} of the lairage period salivary cortisol concentrations did not differ between enriched- and barren-housed pigs. In pigs reared in a barren environment, salivary cortisol concentrations increased significantly after transport and being in lairage, as compared to home pen salivary cortisol concentrations. In pigs reared in an enriched environment, salivary cortisol concentrations did not significantly change after any stage of <b>preslaughter</b> <b>handling</b> and transport as compared with home pen salivary cortisol concentrations. In the truck, pigs reared in a barren environment tended to spend more time walking, standing and manipulating other pigs than enriched-reared pigs. Moreover, pigs reared in a barren environment tended to spend more time walking and fighting in lairage than enriched-reared pigs. Results showed that rearing conditions may affect the behavioural and physiological responses of pigs to <b>preslaughter</b> <b>handling</b> and mixing at transport. The tendency for increased manipulation of pen mates and fighting, and the significant increases in salivary cortisol in response to mixing at transport and being in lairage in pigs reared in a barren environment indicate that pigs reared in a barren environment are likely to experience more stress during common preslaughter procedures than pigs reared in an enriched environment...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Previous {{research}} has indicated that ante-mortem stress factors can influence the development of pale, soft, and exudative (PSE) meat in swine as well as in turkeys. Such antemortem factors can include environ-mental temperatures, relative humidity, <b>preslaughter</b> <b>handling</b> practices, and transportation. However, the ef-fect of transportation on meat quality of turkeys has not been extensively studied. Eighty Nicholas male turkeys (21 wk of age) were divided into two groups and were either transported in coops on a flatbed trailer for 3 h immediately prior to processing or processed without transportation. Breast muscle samples were collected for pH (0, 2, 24 h), L * value (2, 24 h), drip loss, and cook loss. Additionally, breast fillets were marinated and cooked to (Key words: pale, soft, exudative; transportation; turkey; marination; rigor development...|$|E

Pigs (n = 192) were offspring of halothane-free lines. On various days, four groups of 48 pigs were processed at a commercial plant. Within each group, half the pigs {{were exposed to}} either minimal or high preslaughter stress. Before entering the cooler at 45 min postmortem, carcasses of both minimal and high preslaughter stress treatments were allocated randomly to either conventional (+ 4 degreesC for 22 h) or rapid (three-phase chilling tunnel: - 15, - 10, and - 1 degreesC for 15, 38, and 38 min, respectively, followed by storage at 4 degreesC until 22 h postmortem) chilling. Temperature and pH were measured in the blood at exsanguination and in the longissimus lumborum (LL) and semimembranosus (SM) muscle at 0. 5, 2. 5, 4. 5, 6. 5, and 22 h postmortem. Meat quality attributes (water-holding capacity and objective color measurements) were assessed on the LL. Preslaughter stress level affected pH and temperature in both blood and muscle, with lower (P 0. 05) influence the rate of pH decline in the LL muscle, but reduced (P = 0. 061) pH decline in the SM. Rapid chilling, as opposed to conventional chilling, decreased (P < 0. 05) electrical conductivity in the LL, regardless of preslaughter stress; however, it could not compensate for the detrimental effect (P < 0. 05) of stress on drip loss, filter paper moisture absorption, and meat color (L* value).

40|$|The <b>preslaughter</b> <b>handling</b> and {{transport}} of broilers are stressful operations {{that might affect}} welfare and meat quality and could increase numbers of deaths before slaughter. However, the influence of thermal factors during transportation and lairage at slaughterhouses is complex in subtropical regions, where increasing temperature and high RH are the major concerns regarding animal survival before slaughter. In this study we assessed {{the influence of a}} controlled lairage environment on preslaughter mortality rates of broiler chickens that were transported during different seasons of the year and had varying lairage times in the subtropical climate. Preslaughter data from 13, 937 broiler flocks were recorded daily during 2006 in a commercial slaughterhouse in southeastern Brazil. The main factors that influenced daily mortality rate were mean dry bulb temperature and RH, lairage time, daily periods, density of broilers per crate, season of the year, stocking density per lorry, transport time, and distance between farms and slaughterhouse. A holding area at the slaughterhouse with environmental control was assessed. Using a double GLM for mean and dispersion modeling, the seasons were found to have significant effects (P < 0. 05) on average mortality rates. The highest incidence was observed in summer (0. 42 %), followed by spring (0. 39 %), winter (0. 28 %), and autumn (0. 23 %). A decrease of preslaughter mortality of broilers during summer (P < 0. 05) was observed when the lairage time was increased, mainly after 1 h of exposure to a controlled environment. Thus, lairage for 3 to 4 h in a controlled lairage environment during the summer and spring is necessary to reduce the thermal load of broiler chickens.

40|$|Two quality defects of pork {{which are}} {{affected}} by <b>preslaughter</b> <b>handling</b> are PSE (Pale Soft Exudative) and DFD (Dark Firm Dry) meat. The incidence of PSE pork is mainly {{a function of the}} breed of pig but short-term stressful handling before slaughter and feeding too close to slaughter are also involved. DFD meat is a result of prolonged stressful handling. PSE meat is pale and uneven in colour and exudes fluid making it unattractive in the retail display while dark meat appears stale and is prone to bacterial spoilage. After slaughter muscle metabolism continues and muscle glycogen is converted to lactic acid reducing meat pH. Prolonged stress results in glycogen depletion, pre-slaughter feeding results in elevated levels. Colour may be assessed subjectively by eye or objectively by a meter colour but pH of the meat is closely related to colour and measurement of pH at 45 minutes post-slaughter is frequently used to predict ultimate colour and pH. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine pre-slaughter handling practices and their relationship with meat quality (pH, colour). In the first trial, a survey of the amounts of stomach contents in pigs at slaughter in two factories found similar amounts to comparable surveys in France and the UK. It was concluded that most pigs had been fasted for an adequate time before delivery. The relationship between the amount of stomach contents and meat quality in this survey was poor. In the second trial, pigs from the Moorepark herd fed by either a computerised wet feeding system or an ad libitum dry feed system were slaughtered after overnight fasting or with feed available up to loading for transport to the factory, two to three hours before slaughter. There was no difference between feeding systems in meat colour or pH but fasted pigs, on both feeding systems, had darker meat and meat of a higher pH. In the third and fourth trials a survey of transport vehicles was carried out and meat quality of pigs delivered in modern and old-type vehicles was compared. Most trucks examined (78 %) were four years old or more. Few had modern hydraulic lifting gear for the top decks. Space allowances during transportation were generally adequate but delays in unloading could, in warm weather, cause stress on pigs. There was little evidence for an effect of vehicle on meat quality parameters but day to day variation in carcass temperature and pH suggested a need for further research on factory influences on meat quality. Feeding of Magneium Aspartate to pigs for the last 5 days prior to slaughter has been shown, in Australia, to have a beneficial effect on meat colour and drip loss. In the final trial in this study Mg Asp had no effect on meat quality parameters. End of Project ReportsEuropean Union Structural Funds (EAGGF...|$|E
40|$|A complex {{interaction}} of animal factors, pre-slaughter {{management of the}} pig and post-slaughter carcass processing can have a significant influence on pork quality. Pork quality attributes are dependent upon the concentration of glycogen in the muscle at slaughter and the rate and extent of post-slaughter muscle glycolysis. Acute stress just prior to slaughter can lead to rapid rate of glycolysis and therefore rapid accumulation of lactate and a low muscle pH and pale, soft, exudative (PSE) pork. On the other hand low muscle glycogen at slaughter can lead to insufficient lactic acid formation, high muscle pH and dark, firm, dry (DFD) pork. Major pork quality defects such as PSE and DFD have resulted in large economic losses for the Australian pork industry, where PSE pork alone has been estimated to cost the industry $ 24 million per year. This thesis comprises {{a review of the}} literature related to the biochemistry involved, particularly muscle glycogenolysis, in the conversion of muscle to meat and the influence of various animal, pre- and post-slaughter factors on pork quality. The experimental work comprises of six experiments which examine the relationships between on-farm management, pre-slaughter management and post-slaughter processing and their influence on muscle physiology and glycogenolysis and ultimate pork quality. 1. Determination of muscle glycogen and lactic acid concentrations in muscle samples removed from the live pig using a shot-biopsy procedure. A total of 14 male crossbred finisher pigs were used in this experiment. The shot-biopsy procedure was used to remove muscle samples from the live pig. The Longissimus thoracis and Biceps femoris muscle had similar glycogen (13. 7 and 12. 5 mg/g wet weight respectively) and lactic acid (1. 3 and 1. 9 mg/g wet weight respectively) concentrations. By determining resting muscle glycogen and lactic acid concentrations in the live pig, the results can be used as an indicator of the extent of glycogenolysis that occurs in the muscle pre-slaughter and in comparing the influence of pre-slaughter factors such as handling and mixing of unfamiliar pigs on muscle glycogen concentrations at slaughter. 2. The effect of on farm and pre-slaughter handling on pork quality. Thirty-six male crossbred pigs were used in a 2 x 2 factorial design which consisted of 2 on-farm handling treatments (positive and negative handling) and 2 abattoir handling treatments (minimal and negative handling just prior to slaughter). Pigs negatively handled on-farm had lower muscle glycogen concentrations at slaughter, but there was no difference in muscle paleness or % drip loss compared to pigs positively handled on-farm. Pigs negatively handled at the abattoir had lower muscle glycogen concentrations at slaughter, but muscle paleness, % drip loss and the incidence of PSE were similar compared to pigs minimally handled at the abattoir. The results from this experiment indicate that pigs negatively handled on-farm have the potential to respond adversely to handling at the abattoir and hence may result in inferior pork quality. 3. The effect of mixing pigs during lairage and negative handling just prior to slaughter on pork quality. Forty-eight male crossbred pigs were used in a 2 x 2 factorial design which consisted of 2 lairage treatments (unmixed pigs during lairage and pigs mixed during lairage) and 2 abattoir handling treatments (minimal and negative handling just prior to slaughter). Mixing of pigs during lairage induced a high level of fighting among pigs and hence the pigs had lower muscle glycogen concentrations at slaughter, lower % drip, darker pork, a higher incidence of DFD and a lower incidence of PSE pork compared with unmixed pigs kept together during lairage. Negative handling just prior to slaughter did not affect muscle glycogen concentrations at slaughter or pork quality indicators in pigs that were unmixed or mixed during lairage. The unmixed pigs had a higher incidence of PSE irrespective of the handling treatment just prior to slaughter. This experiment has demonstrated that mixing of unfamiliar pigs during lairage can have a major influencer on pork quality, increase the incidence of DFD pork and reduce the incidence of PSE. 4. The effect of negative handling pre-slaughter and delays in carcass processing post-slaughter on pork quality. Forty-eight male crossbred pigs were used in a 2 x 2 factorial design which consisted of 2 abattoir handling treatments (minimal and negative handling just prior to slaughter) and 2 carcass processing durations (normal - 45 min and delayed - 70 min processing). Pigs negatively handled prior to slaughter had lower muscle glycogen concentrations at slaughter, higher surface exudate and higher incidence of PSE pork compared to pigs minimally handled just prior to slaughter. Delays in carcass processing resulted in paler pork in the leg although the effect was minimal. The results from this experiment suggest that the quality of <b>preslaughter</b> <b>handling</b> had a greater effect on the incidence of PSE compared to delays in carcass processing. 5. The effect of dietary magnesium aspartate on pork quality. Forty-eight male crossbred pigs were used in a 2 x 2 factorial design which consisted of 2 diet treatments (control diet and diet supplemented with magnesium aspartate (MgAsp)) and 2 abattoir handling treatments. Pigs fed the MgAsp supplemented diet had higher plasma magnesium concentrations and lower plasma noradrenaline concentrations at slaughter compared to pigs fed the control diet. Pigs fed the control diet also had higher % drip loss, paler pork and a higher incidence of PSE compared to pigs fed the MgAsp supplemented diet. Dietary MgAsp supplementation reduced the incidence of PSE to zero irrespective of the handling treatment prior to slaughter. Pigs fed the control diet and negatively handled at the abattoir had lower muscle glycogen at slaughter and higher % drip loss compared to pigs fed the control diet and minimally handled prior to slaughter. The results from this experiment indicate that dietary MgAsp supplementation is effective in reducing the effects of stress, improving pork quality and reducing the incidence of PSE pork. 6. The effect of different dietary magnesium supplements on pork quality. Fortyeight male crossbred pigs were used in this experiment and consisted of 4 diet treatments (control diet, magnesium aspartate (MgAsp) supplemented diet, magnesium sulphate (MgSO 4) supplemented diet and magnesium chloride (MgC 12) supplemented diet. The MgAsp and MgSO 4 but not the MgC 12 supplemented diet increased plasma magnesium concentrations in comparison with the control diet however no reduction in plasma catecholamine concentrations were observed. Pigs fed the magnesium diets (MgAsp, MgSO 4 and MgCl 2) had higher muscle glycogen concentrations at slaughter and lower % drip loss in comparison with pigs fed the control diet. The results further highlight the benefit of dietary magnesium supplementation in improving pork quality. Thus MgSO 4 and MgC 12, which are cheaper and more readily available sources of magnesium can be as effective as MgAsp in improving pork quality. 7. The effect of dose and duration of dietary magnesium aspartate supplementation on plasma metabolites in pigs. Sixteen crossbred males which were cannulated via the cephalic vein prior to the start of the supplementation period were used in this experiment. The pigs were allocated to one of four diets (control diet, 20 g MgAsp, 40 g MgAsp and 60 g MgAsp respectively). Pigs fed the magnesium diets exhibited increases in plasma magnesium concentration in the first two days. Also the highest increases in plasma magnesium concentrations corresponded to the pigs fed the lowest magnesium supplemented diet. The lowest magnesium dose maintained plasma concentrations throughout the supplementation period whereas the other diets declined to pre-treatment concentrations. The results hence indicate, that a lower dose of dietary magnesium for a shorter duration is more appropriate to maintain increases in plasma magnesium concentration. The results in this thesis demonstrate the importance of positive on-farm handling, management of pigs during the lairage period, handling just prior to slaughter and carcass processing to consistently produce quality pork. The propensity to develop PSE may be already evident prior to transport from the farm, however, results indicate that the factor which determines whether the pork carcass will be PSE is the nature of handling the pigs receives in the last few minutes prior to slaughter. Finally the results from this thesis highlight the effectiveness of dietary magnesium supplementation in improving pork quality and reducing the incidence of PSE pork.
