5|$|By 1472, {{at the age}} of twenty, Leonardo {{qualified}} as a master in the Guild of Saint Luke, the guild of artists and doctors of medicine, but even after his father set him up in his own workshop, his attachment to Verrocchio was such that he continued to collaborate with him. Leonardo's earliest known dated work is a drawing in <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> <b>ink</b> of the Arno valley, drawn on 5 August 1473.|$|E
5|$|Cott's {{account of}} all this (illustrated by his own <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> <b>ink</b> drawings) is the 550-page book Adaptive Coloration in Animals (1940). It was proof-read by Kerr, who commented on its {{publication}} 'It {{is by far the}} finest thing of the kind in existence'.

5|$|Hunter focused {{for much}} of his life on landscapes and on still lifes, working in both <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> <b>ink</b> and oil on canvas. His still lifes of fruit are {{particularly}} distinctive, but he also painted a variety of landscapes, especially of Scotland and France. In his earlier paintings, Hunter was influenced by Cézanne to produce domestic landscapes. Later, however, in common with {{the other members of the}} Scottish colourists movement, he was heavily influenced by contemporary French artists like Monet and Matisse, and his paintings began to make bolder and more energetic use of colour.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1940s Koppelman {{worked at the}} Museum of Non-Objective Painting on 54th Street in Manhattan (which later became the Guggenheim Museum) with, among others, Jackson Pollock, Robert De Niro, Sr., Rolph Scarlett, Lucia Autorino, and Ward Jackson. Two of his early, {{abstract}} <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> <b>ink</b> drawings are in the Guggenheim collection. The first recorded exhibition of Koppelman's work {{was held in the}} Lounge Gallery of the Eighth Street Playhouse in 1942, and included drawings, paintings, and sculpture. The following year, he had a solo exhibition at the Outlines Gallery in Pittsburgh.|$|E

There {{is a complete}} week from each year represented, with additional random cartoons from each year. (There are no holdings for 1946–47.) The daily cartoons display traces of graphite, blue pencil, Zip-A-Tone, brush, <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> <b>ink</b> on illustration board measuring approximately 7 ¼ x 22 ½ inches. The Smithsonian's National Museum of American History has 28 volumes of Branner's proofs for the strip.|$|E

5|$|June Kim, {{the author}} and {{illustrator}} for 12 Days, primarily drew the artwork in the realism style, although she occasionally rendered characters as super-deformed versions of themselves. While the cover art incorporates red and silver coloring, the artwork primarily appears in black and white, with occasional gray shading. Kim used <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> <b>ink</b> as the artistic medium, then toned her art with the software application ComicStudio. For the narrative, she explores the characters' pasts through dreams, and periodic, nonlinear flashbacks. Several character traits, such as Jackie's chocolate allergy, are presented to the reader through inference rather than exposition. Additionally, Kim uses a brief, untranslated Korean song alongside the predominantly English text.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, Potter revised a {{tale about}} a rabbit named Peter {{she had written}} for a child in 1893, and {{prepared}} a dummy book of it in imitation of Helen Bannerman's 1889 best-seller The Story of Little Black Sambo. Unable to find a buyer, she published the book {{for family and friends}} at her own expense in December 1901. Frederick Warne & Co. had earlier rejected the tale, but, anxious to compete in the booming small format children's book market, reconsidered and accepted it following the recommendation of their prominent children's book artist L. Leslie Brooke. Potter agreed to colour the <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> <b>ink</b> illustrations of the private edition, and chose the then-new Hentschel three-colour process for reproducing her watercolours. On 2 October 1902 The Tale of Peter Rabbit was released.|$|E

They married on 18 December 1983, Richards' 40th birthday, and have two daughters, Theodora Dupree and Alexandra Nicole, born in 1985 and 1986 respectively. In September 2014, Richards {{published}} a children's book with Theodora, Gus and Me: The Story of My Granddad and My First Guitar. Theodora was reported as contributing <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> <b>ink</b> illustrations for the book, which {{was inspired by}} the man she's named after (Richards' grandfather Theodore Augustus Dupree).|$|E

25|$|Drawing is a {{means of}} making a picture, using any {{of a wide variety of}} tools and techniques. It {{generally}} involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface. Common tools are graphite pencils, <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> <b>ink,</b> inked brushes, wax color pencils, crayons, charcoals, pastels, and markers. Digital tools that simulate the effects of these are also used. The main techniques used in drawing are: line drawing, hatching, crosshatching, random hatching, scribbling, stippling, and blending. A computer aided designer who excels in technical drawing is referred to as a draftsman or draughtsman.|$|E
25|$|During {{the nine}} years {{he lived in}} Newcastle, Nicholson {{published}} three more books, his Treatise on Projection (1837) containing his portrait, drawn from life by Edward Train, originally in <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> <b>ink.</b> Nicholson's final work was entitled The Guide to Railway Masonry, containing a Complete Treatise on the Oblique Arch and published on 1 January 1839, the third edition of which also contained the portrait by Train. The contrast between this and the earlier portrait by Green is marked: Green painted {{a man at the}} peak of his vigour, while Train drew a much older and poorer man.|$|E

The journal is a {{detailed}} account of the voyage, recording weather observations, events on board, treatment of the sick and descriptions of ports of call en route in particular Rio de Janeiro and Cape Town. His journal is notable for its interest in natural history including descriptions of bird life at Port Jackson and Lord Howe Island on the Lady Penrhyns return voyage. The journal contains 25 drawings in watercolour, <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> <b>ink,</b> including the earliest known surviving illustration of the emu by a European. These elements provide a unique account different from the other First Fleet Journals.|$|E

25|$|Garcia's artistic endeavors were {{represented}} by the Weir Gallery in Berkeley, California from 1989 to 1996. During this period, Roberta Weir (unrelated to Garcia's bandmate) provided Garcia with new art techniques to use, sponsored his first solo show in 1990, and prepared blank etching plates for him to draw on. These would then be processed and printed by gallery staff and brought back to Garcia for approval and signature, usually with a passing of stacks of paper backstage at a Dead show. His annual shows at the Weir Gallery garnered much attention, leading to further shows in New York and other cities. Garcia was an early adopter of digital art media; his artistic style was as varied as his musical output, and he carried small notebooks for <b>pen</b> <b>and</b> <b>ink</b> sketches wherever he toured. Roberta Weir continues to maintain an archive of the artwork of Jerry Garcia.|$|E

Sometimes, when I have been away, and have forgotten to bring any paper <b>and</b> <b>pens</b> <b>and</b> <b>ink</b> with me, I have felt so inclined for writing; and it has quite upset me that, in consequence of not having brought any paper <b>and</b> <b>pens</b> <b>and</b> <b>ink</b> with me, I have been unable to sit down and do a lot of work, but have been compelled, instead, to lounge about all day with my hands in my pockets.|$|R
