5|$|Large {{numbers of}} silky sharks are caught by {{commercial}} and artisanal multispecies shark fisheries operating off Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, the United States, Ecuador, Spain, Portugal, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Yemen, and CÃ´te d'Ivoire. Even greater numbers are caught incidentally by tuna longline and <b>purse</b> <b>seine</b> fisheries throughout its range, particularly those using fish aggregating devices. It {{is the most}} common shark caught as bycatch in the eastern Pacific and Gulf of Mexico tuna fisheries, and the second-most common shark caught as bycatch (next to the blue shark) overall. The fins are valued as an ingredient in shark fin soup, with captured sharks often finned at sea {{and the rest of the}} body discarded. Fins from an estimated one-half to one and a half million silky sharks are traded globally per year; it is the second- or third-most common species auctioned on the Hong Kong fin market, which represents over half the global trade. The meat (sold fresh or dried and salted), skin, and liver oil may also be used, as well as the jaws: this species is the predominant source of dried shark jaw curios sold to tourists in the tropics. Some sport fishers catch silky sharks.|$|E

25|$|The {{schooling}} behaviour of fish is exploited on {{an industrial}} scale by the commercial fishing industry. Huge purse seiner vessels use spotter planes to locate schooling fish, such as tuna, cod, mackerel and forage fish. They can capture huge schools by rapidly encircling them with <b>purse</b> <b>seine</b> nets {{with the help}} of fast auxiliary boats and sophisticated sonar, which can track the shape of the shoal.|$|E
25|$|Given the {{selective}} properties of gillnet fishing, alternative methods of harvest {{are currently being}} studied. Recent WDF reports suggest that <b>purse</b> <b>seine</b> is the most productive method with having highest catch per unit effort (CPUE), but has little information {{on the effectiveness of}} selectively harvesting hatchery-reared salmon. More conclusive research has been conducted jointly between the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation and Bonneville Power Administration on a 10-year study on selective harvest methods of hatchery origin salmon in the Upper Columbia River by <b>purse</b> <b>seine</b> and tangle net. Their 2009 and 2010 findings show that purse seines have a higher percentage of survivability and higher CPUE than does tangle nets. A Colville Tribe biologist reports that during these two years the tribe harvested 3,163 hatchery Chinook while releasing 2,346 wild Chinook with only 1.4% direct or immediate mortality using purse seines, whereas the tangle net was far less productive but had an approximate 12.5% mortality. Researchers commented that the use of recovery boxes and shortened periods between checking the nets would have likely decreased mortality rates. While there is data that shows success of selective methods of harvest at protecting wild and ESA listed salmon, there still must be social acceptance of new methods of fishing.|$|E
25|$|Various fishing methods, {{most notably}} <b>purse</b> <b>seine</b> fishing for tuna {{and the use}} of drift and gill nets, unintentionally kill many dolphins. Accidental {{by-catch}} in gill nets and incidental captures in antipredator nets that protect marine fish farms are common and pose a risk for mainly local dolphin populations. In some parts of the world, such as Taiji in Japan and the Faroe Islands, dolphins are traditionally considered food and are killed in harpoon or drive hunts. Dolphin meat is high in mercury and may thus pose a health danger to humans when consumed.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{commercial}} fisheries catch yellowfin tuna with encircling nets (<b>purse</b> <b>seines),</b> and by industrial longlines. In 2010, 558,761 {{metric tons of}} yellowfin tuna {{were caught in the}} western and central Pacific Ocean.|$|R
2500|$|The {{methods used}} to take most rainbow runner are <b>purse</b> <b>seines,</b> as well as hook and line {{techniques}} and other native fishing methods. [...] At least one case of ciguatera poisoning has been reported from this species on the Virgin Islands.|$|R

25|$|This type of net {{was heavily}} {{used by many}} Japanese, South Korean, and Taiwanese fishing fleets {{on the high seas}} in the 1980s to target tunas. Although highly {{selective}} with respect to size class of animals captured, gillnets are associated with high numbers of incidental captures of cetaceans (whales and dolphins). In the Sri Lankan gillnet fishery, one dolphin is caught for every 1.7-4.0 tonnes of tuna landed. This compares poorly with the rate of one dolphin per 70 tonnes of tuna landed in the eastern Pacific <b>purse</b> <b>seine</b> tuna fishery.|$|E
25|$|Tuna in {{particular}} are of major importance to commercial fisheries. Though tuna migrate across oceans, trying to find them {{there is not the}} usual approach. Tuna tend to congregate in areas where food is abundant, along the boundaries of currents, around islands, near seamounts, and in some areas of upwelling along continental slopes. Tuna are captured by several methods: <b>purse</b> <b>seine</b> vessels enclose an entire surface school with special nets, pole and line vessels which use poles baited with other smaller pelagic fish as baitfish, and rafts called fish aggregating devices are set up, because tuna, as well as some other pelagic fish, tend to congregate under floating objects.|$|E
25|$|Tuna {{purse seiners}} are large purse seiners, {{normally}} over 45 metres, {{equipped to handle}} large and heavy purse seines for tuna. They have the same general arrangement as the American seiner, with the bridge and accommodation placed forward. A crows nest or tuna tower is positioned {{at the top of}} the mast, outfitted with the control and manoeuvre devices. A very heavy boom which carries the power block is fitted at the mast. They often carry a helicopter to search for tuna schools. On the deck are three drum <b>purse</b> <b>seine</b> winches and a power block, with other specific winches to handle the heavy boom and net. They are usually equipped with a skiff.|$|E
5|$|The viper dogfish has no {{economic}} value. It is very infrequently caught in commercial <b>purse</b> <b>seines</b> and bottom trawls targeting other species, though what effect, if any, fishing has on its population is unknown. As a result, the IUCN has listed it under Data Deficient.|$|R

50|$|Most bluefin are {{captured}} commercially by professional fishermen using longlines, <b>purse</b> <b>seines,</b> assorted hook-and-line gear, heavy rods and reels, and harpoons. Recreationally, bluefin {{has been one}} of the most important big-game species sought by sports fishermen since the 1930s, particularly in the United States, but also in Canada, Spain, France and Italy.|$|R
25|$|An older {{method of}} {{harvesting}} {{is to use}} a sweep net, which operates a bit like a <b>purse</b> <b>seine</b> net. The sweep net is a big net with weights along the bottom edge. It is stretched across the pen with the bottom edge extending {{to the bottom of the}} pen. Lines attached to the bottom corners are raised, herding some fish into the purse, where they are netted. Before killing, the fish are usually rendered unconscious in water saturated in carbon dioxide, although this practice is being phased out in some countries due to ethical and product quality concerns. More advanced systems use a percussive-stun harvest system that kills the fish instantly and humanely with a blow to the head from a pneumatic piston. They are then bled by cutting the gill arches and immediately immersing them in iced water. Harvesting and killing methods are designed to minimise scale loss, and avoid the fish releasing stress hormones, which negatively affect flesh quality.|$|E
25|$|When the US Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 {{effectively}} {{stopped the}} capture of Pacific orcas, exhibitors found an area more tolerant of killer whale captures in Iceland. Icelandic herring fishermen had traditionally seen killer whales as competitors for their catch, and sale of live killer whales promised a large new source of income. 48 live killer whales captured in Icelandic waters were exported to marine parks between 1976 and 1988. The capture process was based on luring the orcas by dumping leftovers from herring fishing {{in front of the}} pod, capturing the killer whales in a <b>purse</b> <b>seine</b> net, selecting desirable animals and hauling them on board in a specially designed frame, then placing them in foam-lined boxes full of seawater. However, restrictions on US killer whale import permits and advances in captive breeding programs meant that the market never became as large as expected. Growing concern from conservationists and animal rights activists has caused the Icelandic government {{to limit the number of}} orcas that may be captured each year.|$|E
2500|$|Tens of {{thousands}} of spinner dolphins, mostly eastern and white-bellied varieties, {{were killed in the}} 30 years after <b>purse</b> <b>seine</b> fishing for tuna began in the 1950s. [...] The process killed probably half of all eastern spinner dolphins. They have also been contaminated by pollutants such as DDT and PCBs. Spinner dolphins, as with other species affected by ETP tuna purse-seine fishing, are managed nationally by the coastal countries and internationally by the IATTC. The IATTC has imposed annual stock mortality limits on each <b>purse</b> <b>seine</b> and promulgated regulations regarding the safe release of dolphins.|$|E
25|$|Forage {{fish populations}} are very {{vulnerable}} {{when faced with}} modern fishing equipment. They swim near the surface in compacted schools, so they are relatively easy to locate at the surface with sophisticated electronic fishfinders and from above with spotter planes. Once located, they are scooped {{out of the water}} using highly efficient nets, such as <b>purse</b> <b>seines,</b> which remove most of the school.|$|R

40|$|The Portuguese {{fishery in}} Portugal waters landed its {{greatest}} catches {{in the mid}} 1960 s, and landings have remained lower but steady since then. <b>Purse</b> <b>seines,</b> targeting sardines (Sardina pilchardus), had the highest catches of all fisheries from 1950 - 1999. Fish and cephalopod trawls, crustacean trawls, and multi-gear vessels form the remaining fleets. During the 1990 s, both the catch and value of most target species decreased slightly (except for octopus), due to decreasing fleet sizes in all fisheries. Official Portuguese catch statistics are compatible with ICES landing figures since the late 1980 s. Prior to this period, Portuguese catch statistics are approximately 18 % lower. We assume Portuguese discard rates are low. The Portuguese fishery is dominated by <b>purse</b> <b>seines,</b> which generally have low discard rates. This contrasts with Spanish fishery, which has a greater trawling fleet and is thus more likely to produce higher discard rates. Surprisingly, the biomass of shark discards in Portuguese fishery is probably quite high, as they form a substantial proportion of the trawling fisheries catches, and are nearly always discarded...|$|R
50|$|Typically, {{sardines}} {{are caught}} with encircling nets, particularly <b>purse</b> <b>seines.</b> Many modifications of encircling nets are used, including traps or weirs. The latter are stationary enclosures composed of stakes into which schools of sardines are diverted as they swim along the coast. The fish are caught mainly at night, when {{they approach the}} surface to feed on plankton. After harvesting, the fish are submerged in brine while they are transported to shore.|$|R
2500|$|Commercial {{fishing is}} the main {{industry}} in Cordova. Half of all households in Cordova {{have at least one}} person involved in commercial fishing or processing. The fishing fleet mainly fishes the Prince William Sound and Copper River Delta area. There are various fisheries in the area, the most economically important of which is the salmon fishery. All Pacific salmon species except for the cherry salmon are caught. Fishermen use either a <b>purse</b> <b>seine,</b> drift gillnet, or set gillnet to catch the fish. All fisheries are regulated by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. The fisheries in Alaska have a limited entry permit system. The first fish processing plant near Cordova opened in 1887. In 2009 there were 159 <b>purse</b> <b>seine,</b> 511 drift gilnet, and 27 set gillnet permits fished in the Prince William Sound and Copper River Delta area.
