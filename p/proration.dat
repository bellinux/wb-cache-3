50|$|Both the {{petroleum}} conservationists {{and the major}} oil companies received a system of mandated oil-production levels known as <b>prorationing.</b> The Railroad Commission determined how much oil could be produced monthly in accord with market demand. This practice permitted price-fixing by major oil companies and conservation of Texas’ reserves. The {{tens of thousands of}} independent oilmen who owned most of the East Texas fields opposed <b>prorationing</b> but were reconciled to Thompson’s system when they realized that the commission would allow narrow spacing of wells, a policy which favored the smaller independent producers. In 1944, Thompson moved to protect Texas interests by leading the opposition to the Anglo-American oil treaty in the Middle East. This pact would have formed a commission dominated by the major oil companies to assess post-war demand for Mideast oil and authorized production quotas. Thompson, Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes, and the independent oil companies opposed the idea of giving the major companies so much control over global marketing and production. The treaty eventually failed, but the competition from Mideast oil would continue.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{establish}} an empirical model for oil {{production in the}} lower 48 states that represents its economic, physical, and institutional determinants. We estimate a vector error correction model for oil production in the lower 48 states that specifies real oil prices, average production costs, and <b>prorationing</b> by the Texas Railroad Commission. These modifications enable us to generate a model that accounts {{for most of the}} variation in oil production in the lower 48 states between 1938 and 1991. The result that oil production in the lower 48 states shares stochastic trends with real oil prices, average production costs, and <b>prorationing</b> indicates that accuracy of Hubbert's bell shaped curve is fortuitous. The importance of these factors also indicates why the basic Hotelling model cannot replicate the production path for oil in the lower 48 states. This inability is critical. The negative economic effects associated with high prices and energy shortages imply that the importance of inconsistencies with the basic Hotelling model identified by this analysis may be sufficient to warrant a greater degree of government intervention in the transition from oil than is currently envisioned by most policy makers. ...|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} days of oil exploration, {{drilling}} was governed by the law of capture, which states that the owner of land on which a well resides has the right to any oil from that well even if it was drained from the land of his neighbors. This provided an incentive for each land owner to extract the oil as fast as possible. Each state tried to regulate its own oil by such measures as <b>proration,</b> the limiting of production to some fraction of capacity; but then two great oil fields, the Oklahoma City Oil Field and the East Texas Oil Field, were discovered. This, along with the Great Depression, led to much waste and very low prices, with a catastrophic effect on the industry. The problems were large enough that the states recognized the need for cooperation.|$|E
50|$|The rule of capture {{creates an}} {{incentive}} for an owner to drill as many wells as possible on his piece of land so as to extract the groundwater, oil, or gas before his neighbor. Very dense drilling can result in dissipation of the pressure within an aquifer or oil and gas reservoir, and therefore overdrafting of the aquifer or incomplete extraction of the substance. To mitigate this danger, many states have sought to supersede the rule of capture with conservation acts. Such acts enforce <b>prorationing,</b> pooling, and limits on density of drilling to avoid physical waste and ensure maximum ultimate recovery.|$|R

The Placentia Library District is a single-purpose library district {{governed by}} an elected Board of Trustees. Its principal source of income is property tax <b>proration.</b> The library's early history is much like other communities. Beginning in 1914, the Women's Christian Temperance Union established a reading and recreation room for boys in a storefront on Bradford Avenue. After a successful petition and election by the residents, the Placentia Library District was officially formed on September 2, 1919. The new library district included seven square miles of the Placentia area: the north line was beyond Golden Avenue, the east line along Linda Vista through Hazard's subdivision,the south through Golden State Tract but not as far as Miraloma Avenue and the west line along the Fullerton boundary. The Library Board of Trustees hired Placentia's first Librarian, Sara Rideout, for $0.25 an hour, and the Women's Christian Temperance Union turned over their reading room and 193 books. The library officially opened to the public on January 15, 1920, from 2:00-5:00 p.m. and 7:00-9:00 p.m. By 1926, a new library building was needed {{to meet the needs of}} the growing community. The building, designed in the Spanish Colonial Revival style by renowned architect Carleton Monroe Winslow, features beautiful Talavera tiles created by Mexican potter, Pedro Sanchez. In March 1927, the grand opening was held for the new library building located at 143 S.Bradford Avenue. In 1974, the library again become too small for its growing collection and was moved to its current location in the Civic Center Plaza. That same year the library boundaries expanded to reflect the same boundaries as the city. Today the Placentia Library District holds over 102,000 library materials.|$|E
50|$|A {{crisis for}} the {{petroleum}} industry {{was created by}} the East Texas oil boom of the 1930s, as prices plunged to 25 cents a barrel. The traditional TRC policy of negotiating compromises failed; the governor was forced to call in the state militia to enforce order. Texas oilmen decided they preferred state to federal regulation, and wanted the TRC to give out quotas so that every producer would get higher prices and profits. Pure Oil Company opposed the first statewide oil <b>prorationing</b> order, which was issued by the TRC in August 1930. The order, which was intended to conserve oil resources by limiting the number of barrels drilled per day, was seen by small producers like Pure as a conspiracy between government and major companies to drive them out of business and foster monopoly in the oil industry.|$|R

Allowable oilfield production was calculated as follows: estimated market demand, minus uncontrolled additions to supply, gave the Texas total; this was then prorated among fields and wells in a manner calculated to preserve equity among producers, and to prevent any well from producing beyond its Maximum Efficient Rate (MER). Scheduled allowables are expressed in numbers of calendar days of permitted production per month at MER. In the Spring of 2013, new hydraulic fracturing water recycling rules were adopted in the state of Texas by the Railroad Commission of Texas. The Water Recycling Rules are intended to encourage Texas hydraulic fracturing operators to conserve water used in the hydraulic fracturing process for oil and gas wells.|$|R

Third, there is a decades-old controversy over the special provisions of the federal corporation income tax law which apply to petroleum producers. The article presents a model of investment in proved reserves in the U. S. crude petroleum producing industry. The empirical results indicate that investment in petroleum reserves depended on three public policies: the special federal tax pro- visions, state market-demand <b>prorationing,</b> and the federal oil import quota.

40|$|<b>Proration</b> is the {{restriction}} of oil production so that production will {{not exceed the}} current consumptive needs, considering oil and oil products in storage, available imports, and other facters. This program rests on a tripod, so to speak, the first leg being the <b>proration</b> laws of the oil-producing States, the second being the Federal Government in the from of legislation, and the third being the large integrated oil companies. That program has been sponsored by the major oil companies to control over-production of crude oil. Since <b>proration</b> was effective, the behavior of crude oil price became far more stable, and with minor exceptions, {{the only way it}} ever moved was upwards. In view of the supply inelasticity of competitive crude oil production, the smoothness of the transitions from one price to another and the long period of stability in the face of changing demand bespeak the characteristic of administered price. After World War II crude oil prices have risen sharply. This price rise is much greater than the cost rise per foot of wells drilled. This high price is reached and maintained by means of severe output controls to assure the greatest profit to the major companics. High prices and special tax arrangements stimulated the exploration and development of oil wells and produced an increasing surplus of oil producing capacity over output.
