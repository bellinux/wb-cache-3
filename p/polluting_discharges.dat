50|$|The largest {{technical}} challenge facing the Flussbad {{comes in the}} form of the raw-sewage overflow pumped into the Spree Canal by the combined sewage system during heavy rain. Although these heavily <b>polluting</b> <b>discharges</b> would be cleaned by the plant filter in the Friedrichsgracht area before reaching the bathing area further downstream, there remains the problem of one especially large overflow pipe located near the Schleusenbrücke, which is directly in the planned swimming area. In order to get this liability under control, the Flussbad team intends to build a control structure into the sewage pipe that would retain the wastewater accumulated there and, after the rain stopped, slowly funnel it back to the sewage treatment plants. This would prevent the wastewater from entering the swimming area.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION In the past, {{the growth}} of urban agglomerations in Europe caused major {{disruptions}} in basic needs such as public health, hygiene, and safety against flooding. Starting in the last century, large scale urban drainage systems were implemented to tackle the worst water related problems in urban areas. Subsequently, flood protection and public health improved dramatically. At the same time, the quality of receiving waters deteriorated {{as a result of}} the increased and more <b>polluted</b> <b>discharges.</b> Wastewater treatment schemes were implemented to alleviate this problem. Today, among urban drainage engineers the concept still prevails that "receiving water protection is equal to pollution discharge reduction". While the engineer traditionally focuses on water quality and its improvement, biologists claim that the ecological quality of a receiving water is determined by numerous factors of which many are only poorly understood. A reasonable water quality is merely...|$|R

40|$|Summary: Treatment of <b>polluting</b> <b>discharges</b> from {{abandoned}} mines {{is producing}} {{large quantities of}} ochre (mainly iron (III) oxides) for which no major end-use has yet been identified. At the same time, phosphorus pollution is {{a serious threat to}} the water environment in industrialised countries, causing eutrophication, algal blooms, fish kills and loss of water resources. Newcastle and Edinburgh Universities are currently conducting research to develop and test novel field-scale methods to use ochre for phosphorus removal from agricultural runoff and sewage effluent. Our laboratory experiments have demonstrated that ochre is an excellent adsorbent of phosphorus from solution (up to 30 g P kg- 1). Phosphorus removal is unaffected by phosphorus form (total, inorganic, organic) and solution pH. Potential applications of ochre for phosphorus removal from agricultural runoff and sewage effluent are discussed, including treatment of agricultural drainage with ochre-filled filter and dosing units and ochre-filled reaction vessels for sewage effluent treatment...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the basis}} is {{explained}} on which economists {{argue for the}} use of price incentive systems (such as emissions taxation or the creation of a market in tradeable discharge permits) and against the use of regulatory control systems, specifying upper limits on discharges or process and equipment constraints, for the control of pollution. It is noted that practice of pollution control very rarely involves price incentives. It is argued that the question of why practice ignores the recommendation of economists is interesting and important. Some suggestions are made as to where {{the answer to the question}} might lie. It is shown that a price incentive system (the taxation of inputs to production which gives rise to <b>polluting</b> <b>discharges)</b> in which economists have shown rather little interest, retains some of the attractive properties of emissions taxation and avoids the need of the latter for the continuous monitoring of emissions, which need may be a factor working against the adoption of conventional price incentive systems for pollution control. ...|$|E

Although data indicate a decline of <b>polluted</b> <b>discharges</b> to the Bohai, one tabulation shows that the area of the sea that is polluted has increased each year from 2001 to 2005.

40|$|The {{management}} of the urban water cycle (UWC) is a subject of increasing interest because of its social, economic and environmental impact. The most important issues include the sustainable use of limited resources and the reliability of service to consumers with adequate quality and pressure levels, {{as well as the}} urban drainage management to prevent flooding and <b>polluting</b> <b>discharges</b> to the environment. Climate change is expected to produce regional changes in water availability in the 21 st century. For example, Northern and Southern Europe are expected to experience, respectively, an increase and a decrease in mean precipitation, as well as an increase in the magnitude and frequency of extreme events [1]. These changes will have direct consequences through impacts on the availability and quality of water in the water cycle. Optimal management strategies for the systems in the water cycle can contribute to reduce the vulnerability of urban water systems (UWS) to climatic variability and change. An UWC is mainly comprised of the following systems: (i) Supply/production: water supply from superficial or underground sources and treatment to achieve necessary quality levels, (ii) transport networks, which use natural or artificial open-flow channels and/or pressurized conduits to deliver water from the treatment plants to the consumer areas...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} physicochemical parameters {{were measured}} {{to determine the}} quality of the drainage water of Tamarindo Irrigation Sector, at the Arenal-Tempisque Irrigation District: temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen saturation percentage, electrical conductivity, chemical oxygen demand, concentration of suspended solids, nitrates and total phosphorous, as well as the concentration of zinc, fats and oils. The measurements were taken when it was estimated that drainage water had received the highest pollution loads from the surrounding paddy fields, {{during the second half of}} 2002 and the year 2003. The results were evaluated using the water quality index for the management of floodplain lakes (ICA-L). The water from Tamarindo Irrigation Sector, which entered the Palo Verde National Park (PNPV) through La Bocana lagoon, got an average value of ICA-Lp of 70. Relevant increases in total phosphorous concentration were found. Zinc generated a punctual pollution problem in the area of irrigation when it was applied to the rice during the dry season. The Chilo Campo sampling point and the La Bocana lagoon showed a continuous contamination with fats and oils, which would prevent its use in floodplain lagoons of PNPV. Comparison between the results obtained at the sampling points of Chilo Ocampo and La Bocana showed that the buffer zone exerts a beneficial effect, particularly regarding suspended solids, nitrates and total phosphorous (rainy season of 2002), but not enough to control the influence of <b>polluting</b> <b>discharges</b> from the irrigation system...|$|E

Higher Organic content in the Mercerizer effluent was identified which is due to the acidic nature of Neutralizing agents.

30|$|Recognition of the upstream-downstream {{linkages}} in a {{river basin}} means realizing that events {{that occur in the}} upper part of the basin have a direct influence downstream and that issues arising downstream can sometimes be addressed through interventions upstream. There are many ways in which the activities of those living upstream may influence the opportunities available to downstream inhabitants. Such impacts are generally more pronounced at a small-to-medium scale, but can also take effect at a larger scale. Typical examples might include <b>polluted</b> <b>discharge</b> in an upstream catchment that makes water downstream unusable; withdrawal of large amounts of water for irrigation upstream, leaving less water available downstream; as well as widespread land use change upstream which affects water availability and sediment loads downstream. Beneficial interventions might include flood mitigation measures and projects to balance seasonal water supply, such as developing small scale water storage over a wide area to capture excess runoff (Molden et al. [2014]), maintaining vegetation cover to reduce erosion, and dam construction to provide electricity, water, and/or flood regulation for downstream users. Detailed discussion of the impact of planned interventions like construction of dams and irrigation schemes goes beyond the scope of this paper, but clearly, human intervention can affect hydrological dynamics on a large scale.|$|R
