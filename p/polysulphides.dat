Significant amounts of methylthioethers and alkenes, sometimes with additional thiolane or thiophene moieties, were released from the polar and asphaltene fractions of the oil by this method.

Thiophytol was, however, converted to 1 and 2 in 79 % yield. A mixture of phytadienes was almost quantitatively converted into polysulphide-linked oligomers consisting of two to ten phytane units (mean molecular weight ca. 1400 daltons) after 5 days at room temperature. 1 -Hexadecene was converted under similar conditions into a mixture of 2, 2 ′-dihexadecyl <b>polysulphides</b> in about 17 % yield. The formation of the dimers and oligomers is rationalized by a stepwise Markovnikov-type addition of hydrogen <b>polysulphides</b> to isolated or conjugated double bond(s), respectively.

40|$|As a {{continuation}} of the preliminary study of the colorimetric method as a rapid means of control of polysulphide solutions, the effect of free alkali on sodium polysulphide solutions at room temperature was studied, since in the process of dipping the washing-out of the suint of the fleece results in the interaction of clipwash with alkali and in the formation of alkali <b>polysulphides.</b> It was found that the chemical interaction, as revealed by ordinary chemical analysis, is slight, though the colorimetric study reveals a marked change in chemical nature. This change was ascribed, either to the formation of a complex compound between the alkali and the polysulphide, or to the existence of different isomers of the <b>polysulphides</b> in solution. The observation that field samples of lime-sulphur cannot be directly compared calorimetrically is thus partially explained. It was further shown that the addition of excess sodium carbonate and alcohol causes immediate precipitation of all turbidity-forming materials, rendering a perfectly clear solution of the alkali <b>polysulphides</b> which can be matched against a potassium dichromate standard.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} {{in the development of}} lithium-sulphur batteries is the so called “shuttle mechanism”, which involves the diffusion of sulphur and <b>polysulphides</b> from the sulphur electrode to the lithium electrode, where they get reduced via chemical reactions with lithium. The shuttle mechanism decreases the capacity delivered by the battery, hampers its rechargeability, and promotes battery self-discharge. We have developed a simple model of the shuttle mechanism that reproduces quantitatively the rate of the initial self discharge of lithium-sulphur batteries. The rate of sulphur and polysulphide diffusion has been quantified by studying cells with varying number of separators between the electrodes. We have found that it is essential that the model incorporates the presence of carbon additive in the sulphur electrode, which slows down the decrease of the open circuit potential with time. The model also reproduces well the rate of self-discharge of lithium-sulphur cells containing sulphur dissolved in the electrolyte. In conclusion, the present model provides a basic understanding of the mechanism of self-discharge of lithium-sulphur cells, and allows quantifying the two main causes of sulphur loss at the sulphur electrode: sulphur diffusion across a concentration gradient and sulphur reaction with <b>polysulphides</b> formed at the lithium electrode...|$|E
40|$|The major {{challenges}} in Li-S batteries are {{the formation of}} soluble <b>polysulphides</b> during the reversible conversion of S- 8 Li 2 S, large changes in sulphur particle volume during lithiation and extremely poor charge transport in sulphur. We demonstrate here a novel and simple strategy to overcome these challenges towards practical realization of a stable high performance Li-S battery. For the first time, a strategy is developed which does away with the necessity of pre-fabricated high surface area hollow-structured adsorbates and also multiple nontrivial synthesis steps related to sulphur loading inside such adsorbates. A lithiated polyethylene glycol (PEG) based surfactant tethered on ultra-small sulphur nanoparticles and wrapped up with polyaniline (PAni) (abbreviated as S-MIEC) is demonstrated here as an exceptional cathode for Li-S batteries. The PEG and PAni network around the sulphur nanoparticles serves as an efficient flexible trap for sulphur and <b>polysulphides</b> and also provides distinct pathways for electrons (through PAni) and ions (through PEG) during battery operation. Contrary to the cathodes demonstrated based on various carbon-sulphur composites, the mixed conducting S-MIEC showed an extremely high loading of 75 %.

In {{this way the}} amount of polysulphide-linked vs mono- and polysulphide-linked carbon skeletons was assessed. Steranes, phytane and gammacerane are bound by <b>polysulphide</b> linkages in large amounts (30 % or more) in the immature Vena del Gesso sediment whereas squalane, isorenieratane and C 35 hopane carbon skeletons are hardly bound at all by polysulphide-bonds only. The amounts of polysulphide-bound carbon skeletons are much lower in samples from the Northern Apennines and the Monterey Formation and consist predominantly of n-alkanes. Phytane and steranes are relatively more polysulphide-linked than -carotane and n-alkanes in the oils. This phenomenon may be explained {{in part by the}} number of carbon-sulphur bonds by which they are bound to the macromolecular moieties, since it is statistically unlikely that moieties bound by several sulphur-bonds are linked exclusively by polysulphide-bonds. Other explanations, however, such as differences in the timing and nature of the sulphur incorporation processes have also to be considered...|$|R
40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the effect of single {{extensions}} and continuous fatigue on the structures of various natural rubber networks. The change in network structure of a conventional vulcanisate on a single extension manifests itself as permanent set. The change in network structure has been assessed by the use of the chemical probes, propan- 2 -thiol/piperidine, hexane-thiol/piperidine and triphenyl phosphine, which determine the <b>polysulphide</b> and disulphide crosslink densities and main chain modification respectively. The permanent set induced on a single extension of a conventional sulphur vulcanisate has been shown to result from the destruction and reformation of <b>polysulphide</b> crosslinks. The magnitude of the effect was dependent upon the degree of extension and showed a maximum at extensions corresponding to the onset of stress-induced crystallisation. The incorporation of a reinforcing filler, HAF-carbon black, magnified the effect. Vulcanisates that possessed only mono and disulphide crosslinks did not show any significant permanent set. The continuous changes in network structure during fatigue have also been determined, and the effects of carbon black and antioxidants on these changes and the fatigue life have been assessed. During fatigue the overall crosslink density increased slightly, which resulted from the destruction of <b>polysulphide</b> crosslinks. and their replacement by principally disulphide crosslinks. Antioxidants reduced the rate of destruction of <b>polysulphide</b> crosslinks and increased the fatigue life of the rubber network.

Although <b>polysulphides</b> were detected on pyrite after long reaction times, soluble sulphate appears to be the major oxidation product. The difference in the oxidation state and amount of gold detected on pyrite and galena plates from solutions of Nadollar 3 Au(S 3 O 3) 2 dollar, suggest that the ability of the mineral to concentrate reduced gold will be a function of the reduction potential of the mineral and the gold complex.;Nadollar 2 PdCl 4 dollar is also reduced to the metal by all three minerals.
