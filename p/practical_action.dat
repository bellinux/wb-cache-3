According to <b>Practical</b> <b>Action,</b> {{microgeneration}} at home {{which uses}} {{the latest in}} cost saving-technology (wiring harnesses, ready boards, cheap DIY-power plants, e.g. DIY wind turbines) the household expenditure can be extremely low-cost. In fact, <b>Practical</b> <b>Action</b> mentions that many households in farming communities {{in the developing world}} spend less than $1 for electricity per month[...] However, if matters are handled less economically (using more commercial systems/approaches), costs will be dramatically higher. In most cases however, financial advantage will still be done using microgeneration on renewable power plants; often in the range of 50-90% [...] as local production has no electricity transportation losses on long distance power lines or energy losses from the Joule effect in transformers where in general 8-15% of the energy is lost.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Objective: This paper {{examines}} the positive influence that personality {{has on the}} level of engagement workers have in their work. By determining the connection between personality characteristics and work engagement, leaders can be proactive in promoting higher levels of engagement by their workers. Background: Engaging in one’s work encompasses the total person and includes elements such as energy, mental resilience, willingness to invest in one’s work, enthusiasm, pride, and the happiness that comes with being involved in work. The level of work engagement of workers in their work has implications for the workers {{as well as for the}} organization. Method: Through a review of literature related to personality characteristics and work engagement, the personality characteristics having a positive influence on work engagement are identified. Along with these characteristics, the <b>practical</b> <b>actions</b> associated with these characteristics that have been shown to promote work engagement are discussed. Results: On the basis of literature reviewed, the personality characteristics of conscientiousness, extraversion, and proactive personality were found to have a positive influence on work engagement. Associated with these personality characteristics are a variety of <b>practical</b> <b>actions</b> that impact work engagement. Conclusion: The connection between personality characteristics and engagement in work has been identified. Utilizing <b>practical</b> <b>actions</b> that have been shown to be a positive influence on work engagement is beneficial for the workers as well as for the organization. Application: Leaders can achieve higher levels of success by utilizing the <b>practical</b> <b>actions</b> associated with certain personality characteristics to promote higher levels of work engagement among workers...|$|R

2500|$|In 1955 Schumacher {{travelled}} to Burma as {{an economic}} consultant. While there, he developed the set of principles he called [...] "Buddhist economics", {{based on the belief}} that individuals need good work for proper human development. He also proclaimed that [...] "production from local resources for local needs is the most rational way of economic life." [...] He travelled throughout many Third World countries, encouraging local governments to create self-reliant economies. Schumacher's experience led him to become a pioneer of what is now called appropriate technology: user-friendly and ecologically suitable technology applicable to the scale of the community; a concept very close to Ivan Illich's conviviality. He founded the Intermediate Technology Development Group (now <b>Practical</b> <b>Action)</b> in 1966. His theories of development have been summed up for many in catch phrases such as [...] "intermediate size", and [...] "intermediate technology". He was a trustee of Scott Bader Commonwealth and in 1970 the president of the Soil Association.|$|E
2500|$|Croly {{notes that}} women's clubs were not created to copy men's groups; instead, {{they were often}} created to give women a space to share ideas as equals; these ideas often {{developed}} into <b>practical</b> <b>action.</b> As Mary I. Wood and Percy V. Pennybacker described it: [...] "Very early the club women became unwilling to discuss Dante and Browning over the teacups, at meetings of their peers in some lady's drawing room, while unsightly heaps of rubbish flanked the paths over which they had passed in their journeys thither." [...] Women justified their movement into social reform by using the Victorian idea that women were naturally morally superior to men. As clubs moved from self-improvement to community improvement, women's clubs in the Western U.S. lagged somewhat behind clubs formed in more developed parts of the country. Woman's clubs in the late 1800s described themselves as attempting to [...] "exert a refining and ennobling influence" [...] on their communities. They also saw woman's clubs as an intellectual and practical good which would create better women and a better country.|$|E

60|$|If the {{excellent}} Betteredge {{had been present}} while I was considering that question, {{and if he had}} been let into the secret of my thoughts, he would, no doubt, have declared that the German side of me was, on this occasion, my uppermost side. To speak seriously, it is perhaps possible that my German training was in some degree responsible for the labyrinth of useless speculations in which I now involved myself. For the greater part of the night, I sat smoking, and building up theories, one more profoundly improbable than another. When I did get to sleep, my waking fancies pursued me in dreams. I rose the next morning, with Objective-Subjective and Subjective-Objective inextricably entangled together in my mind; and I began the day which was to witness my next effort at <b>practical</b> <b>action</b> of some kind, by doubting whether I had any sort of right (on purely philosophical grounds) to consider any sort of thing (the Diamond included) as existing at all.|$|E
60|$|So, too, among birds, the parrots {{and their}} allies climb trees and rocks with {{exceptional}} ease and agility. Even in their own department they are the great feathered acrobats. Anybody who watches a woodpecker, for example, grasping the bark of a tree with its crooked and powerful toes, while it steadies itself behind by digging its stiff tail-feathers into the crannies of the outer rind, will readily understand how clear a notion the bird must gain into the <b>practical</b> <b>action</b> {{of the laws of}} gravity. But the true parrots go a step further in the same direction than the woodpeckers or the toucans; for, in addition to prehensile feet, they have also a highly-developed prehensile bill, and within it a tongue which acts in reality as an organ of touch. They use their crooked beaks to help them in climbing from branch to branch; and being thus provided alike with wings, legs, hands, fingers, bill and tongue, they are in fact the most truly arboreal of all known animals, and present in the fullest and highest degree all the peculiar features of the tree-haunting existence.|$|E

60|$|They {{were bound}} for Italy; so Alan had decided. Turning {{over in his}} mind {{the pros and cons}} of the situation, he had wisely {{determined}} that Herminia's confinement had better take place somewhere else than in England. The difficulties and inconveniences which block the way in English lodgings would have been well-nigh insufferable; in Italy, people would only know that an English signora and her husband had taken apartments for a month or two in some solemn old palazzo. To Herminia, indeed, this expatriation at such a moment was in many ways to the last degree distasteful; for her own part, she hated the merest appearance of concealment, and would rather have flaunted the open expression of her supreme moral faith before the eyes of all London. But Alan pointed out to her the many practical difficulties, amounting almost to impossibilities, which beset such a course; and Herminia, though it was hateful to her thus to yield to the immoral prejudices of a false social system, gave way at last to Alan's repeated expression of the necessity for prudent and <b>practical</b> <b>action.</b> She would go with him to Italy, she said, as a proof of her affection and her confidence in his judgment, though she still thought the right thing was to stand by her guns fearlessly, and fight it out to the bitter end undismayed in England.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will try}} to answer {{you in a few}} words," [...] said Ezra Jennings. [...] "The action of opium is comprised, in the {{majority}} of cases, in two influences--a stimulating influence first, and a sedative influence afterwards. Under the stimulating influence, the latest and most vivid impressions left on your mind--namely, the impressions relating to the Diamond--would be likely, in your morbidly sensitive nervous condition, to become intensified in your brain, and would subordinate to themselves your judgment and your will exactly as an ordinary dream subordinates to itself your judgment and your will. Little by little, under this action, any apprehensions about the safety of the Diamond which you might have felt during the day would be liable to develop themselves from the state of doubt to the state of certainty--would impel you into <b>practical</b> <b>action</b> to preserve the jewel--would direct your steps, with that motive in view, into the room which you entered--and would guide your hand to the drawers of the cabinet, until you had found the drawer which held the stone. In the spiritualised intoxication of opium, you would do all that. Later, as the sedative action began to gain on the stimulant action, you would slowly become inert and stupefied. Later still you would fall into a deep sleep. When the morning came, and the effect of the opium had been all slept off, you would wake as absolutely ignorant of what you had done in the night as if you had been living at the Antipodes. Have I made it tolerably clear to you so far?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{real issue}} in this controversy--the one {{dressing}} upon every mind--is the sentiment {{on the part of}} one class that looks upon the institution of slavery as a wrong, and of another class that does not look upon it as a wrong. The sentiment that contemplates the institution of slavery in this country as a wrong is the sentiment of the Republican party. It is the sentiment around which all their actions, all their arguments, circle; from which all their propositions radiate. They look upon it as being a moral, social, and political wrong; and while they contemplate it as such, they nevertheless have due regard for its actual existence among us, and the difficulties of getting rid of it in any satisfactory way, and to all the constitutional obligations thrown about it. Yet, having a due regard for these, they desire a policy in regard to it that looks to its not creating any more danger. They insist that it, as far as may be, be treated as a wrong; and one of the methods of treating it as a wrong is to make provision that it shall grow no larger. They also desire a policy that looks to a peaceful end of slavery some time, as being a wrong. These are the views they entertain in regard to it, as I understand them; and all their sentiments, all their arguments and propositions are brought within this range, I have said, and I here repeat it, that if there be a man amongst us who does not think that the institution of slavery is wrong in any one of the aspects of which I have spoken, he is misplaced, and ought not to be with us. And if there be a man amongst us who is so impatient of it as a wrong as to disregard its actual presence among us, and the difficulty of getting rid of it suddenly in a satisfactory way, and to disregard the constitutional obligations thrown about it, that man is misplaced if he is on our platform. We disclaim sympathy with him in <b>practical</b> <b>action.</b> He is not placed properly with us.|$|E
