50|$|This scandal, {{involving}} Sergei Krivokrasov, {{occurred during}} 3rd game of 2003-04 Russian Hockey Super League playoff semifinals between Avangard Omsk and HC Lada Togliatti. At 3:05 {{left in the}} third period, Lada Head coach, Petr Vorobiev, asked for Krivokrasov's stick measurement. The referee for the game, Sergei Gusev, accepted the request, however delayed the procedure by several minutes. Stick was measured and proved legal, so Lada was given a minor <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> <b>delaying</b> the game.|$|R
50|$|However, it was {{witnessed}} by several Lada staff members, that Krivokrasov {{had changed his}} stick during the delay—and reported immediately to game officials. This appeal was denied, so Vorobiev ordered his team to leave the ice as a protest. After the short consultation with game inspector, referee finally called minor and misconduct penalties against Krivokrasov, but Lada refused to return, since their minor <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> <b>delaying</b> the game stayed intact. 1:0 victory (the score before the incident) was awarded then to Avangard.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{examines}} {{experimental evidence}} relating to herd behaviour in situations when subjects {{can learn from}} each other, and can delay their decision. Subjects acted rationally, gaining from observational learning, despite <b>penalties</b> <b>for</b> <b>delay.</b> Cascades were ubiquitous and reverse-cascades occurred in which incorrect decisions made by early decisionmakers produced herds on the incorrect choice. The major departure from rationality came when subjects realized they had chosen incorrectly despite following the majority view. This led many to add extra delay to future decision-making. It is argued {{that this may be}} due to certain cognitive biases, and is likely to make matters worse, making it all the more important that policy-makers attempt to minimize the chance of reverse-cascades. 1...|$|R

50|$|During a faceoff, {{a player}} may be {{judged to be}} in an offside {{position}} if they are lined up within 15 feet of the centres before the puck is dropped. This may result in a faceoff violation, at which point the official dropping the puck will wave the centre out of the faceoff spot and require that another player take their place. If one team commits two violations during the same attempt to restart play, it will be assessed a minor <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> <b>delay</b> of game.|$|E
50|$|A team which {{shoots the}} puck forward from their {{half of the}} ice over the {{opposing}} team's goal line {{in an effort to}} stonewall is guilty of icing, and the puck is brought {{to the other end of}} the ice for a face-off. The rule is not in effect when a team is playing shorthanded due to a penalty. Additionally, a player (usually a goalkeeper) may be charged with a minor (two-minute) <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> <b>delay</b> of game for shooting the puck over the glass and out of play.|$|E
50|$|Two {{specific}} rules {{were created to}} keep play moving. The first was that a player in their own defensive half was not permitted to kick the ball directly over the boards out of play. Doing so {{would result in a}} two-minute <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> <b>delay</b> of game. The second allowed the goalie to clear the ball only by throwing the ball to teammates within the defensive half of the field. Kicking the ball to clear it or throwing the ball to a teammate beyond midfield would result in an indirect free kick from the spot of the illegal pass.|$|E
40|$|Concession {{contracts}} are agreements granting {{the right to}} construct public works, operate and provide a service or a good. Although most contracts include <b>penalties</b> <b>for</b> <b>delays,</b> evidence from ongoing concession contracts shows that time overruns are widespread. Uncertainty over future payoffs generates investment timing flexibility that, if optimally exercised, can increase the contract value for the contractor firm. Therefore concessionaires may find it optimal to delay irreversible investments regardless the presence of penalty clauses. This investment timing flexibility {{should be taken into}} account when determining the penalty fees. Following the Real Option Approach we model the concessionaire’s optimal investment strategy and determine the optimal penalty fee that induces the concessionaire to comply with contract provisions on time. The higher the concessionaire’s option value to delay, the higher the optimal penalty to be set...|$|R
40|$|The term "pro-active {{scheduler}} " will denote {{a set of}} scheduling rules {{which are}} optimized NOT only for a given set of jobs, but also to minimize the adverse impact of server failures or job additions or deletions during the period for which the scheduler was optimized. This paper presents a genetic-algorithm-based method to produce such schedulers for a real-time Job Shop Scheduling Problem in a changing environment. The empirical results show that this approach can produce schedulers capable of constructing schedules in polynomial time, and that those schedulers can react well to the random failures/changes presented to them. The goal of the genetic algorithm is to choose optimal, time-varying weighting factors for a fixed set of heuristic rules which determine the assignment of each job to any of multiple, distinct servers at each of multiple server stages, {{in order to minimize}} the total production costs (including setup, operation, <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> needing express shipping, and <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> <b>delayed</b> delivery). 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the supplier’s strategic {{delivery lead time}} in a public procurement setting {{as the result of}} the firm’s opportunistic behaviour on the optimal investment timing. In the presence of uncertainty on construction costs, we model the supplier’s option to defer the contract’s execution as a Put Option. We include in the model both the discretion of the court of law in enforcing contractual clauses (i. e. a <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> <b>delays)</b> and the "quality" of the judicial system. Then, we calibrate the model using parameters that mimic the Italian procurement for public works and calculate the maximum amount that a firm is "willing to pay" (per day) to postpone the delivery date and infringe the contract provisions. Our results show that the incentive to delay is greater the higher the construction costs and their volatility, and the weaker the penalty enforcement by the courts of law...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the game clock, a separate play clock is also used. This counts down the time the offense has to start the next play before it is assessed a <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> <b>delay</b> of game (see below). This clock is typically 25 seconds from when the referee marks the ball ready for play. The NFL and NCAA use a 40-second play clock that starts immediately after the previous play ends, though for certain delays, such as penalty enforcement, the offense has 25 seconds from when the ball is marked ready. The purpose of the play clock {{is to ensure that}} the game progresses at a consistent pace, preventing unnecessary delays.|$|E
5000|$|New {{since the}} 2005-06 NHL season, after {{testing in the}} American Hockey League, a {{trapezoid}} is marked behind each goalie net. The goalie can only play the puck within that area or {{in front of the}} goal line. If he plays the puck behind the goal line and not in the trapezoid, a 2-minute minor <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> <b>delay</b> of game will be assessed by the referees. This rule is widely referred to as the [...] "Brodeur rule", after New Jersey Devils goalie Martin Brodeur, whose puckhandling behind the net {{is believed to be the}} cause for the rule.

50|$|The Phoenix Bridge Company {{was awarded}} the {{contract}} to install the bascule span. Numerous delays were incurred during {{the installation of the}} span, leading to budgetary overruns. The contract between the bridge company and the AMBC imposed a <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> <b>delays,</b> and the federal government duly assessed a penalty of $12,300 on the firm. The Phoenix Bridge Company filed suit in the United States Court of Federal Claims, arguing that the penalty was not the fault of the company but due to government-imposed changes in the bridge's construction. The company also asked {{for the federal government to}} pay the additional costs. At trial, the Phoenix Bridge Company claimed it could have rented its equipment and labor for $27,433, and that the federal government owed the company this rental income. The Court of Claims agreed, and ordered the government to withdraw the penalty as well.|$|R
50|$|In many {{football}} games, {{the play}} clock is {{managed by the}} back judge who is positioned behind the defense and faces the quarterback. When the play clock counts down to 5 seconds remaining, some back judges will raise their arm over their head to warn the quarterback, and rotate their arm downward to their leg, counting down the final seconds. A <b>penalty</b> flag <b>for</b> <b>delay</b> is thrown afterward. The infraction typically results in a five-yard penalty.|$|R
40|$|The {{decision}} {{aspects of}} inventory management revolve around striking some {{balance between the}} costs of change {{and the costs of}} failing to change. However, in any but the simplest cases of economic order quantities it is difficult to specify precisely how one cost interacts with the other: by how much exactly do additional set-ups reduce the total cost of inventories or wasted production, or the total <b>penalties</b> <b>for</b> <b>delayed</b> deliveries or lost sales [...] supposing that units are taken out of inventory by some demand function and added to inventories by some production function? This paper analyzes the interaction of the various costs and provides relatively simple optimizing formulae assuming that, mainly, a) demand is reasonably well approximated by a linear function of time; b) production proceeds at a constant rate between one set-up and the next; c) demand and production overlap in time such that the total quantity produced in any one lot interval equals the total quantity consumed in that interval (a unit being consumed as soon as it is ready, though the run from which it comes is not yet completed); and if d) inventories are permitted; that is, surplus production is storable and backorders are acceptable, though both are more or less costly. ...|$|R
