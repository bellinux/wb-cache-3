40|$|Inherited retinal degenerations, such as {{retinitis}} pigmentosa (RP) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), represent {{leading causes of}} incurable blindness in humans. This is also true in dogs, where the term progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is used to describe inherited photoreceptor degeneration resulting in progressive vision loss. Because of the similarities in ocular anatomy, including {{the presence of a}} cone photoreceptor-rich central retinal region, and the close genotype-phenotype correlation, canine models contribute significantly to the understanding of retinal disease mechanisms and the development of new therapies. The screening of the <b>pure-bred</b> <b>dog</b> population for new forms of PRA represents an important strategy to establish new large animal models. By examining 324 dogs of the Swedish vallhund breed in seven countries and across three continents, we were able to describe a new and unique form of PRA characterized by the multifocal appearance of red and brown discoloration of the tapetal fundus followed over time by thinning of the retina. We propose three stages of the disease based on the appearance of the ocular fundus and associated visual deficits. Electroretinography revealed a gradual loss of both rod and cone photoreceptor-mediated function in Stages 2 and 3 of the disease. In the few dogs that suffered from pronounced vision loss, night-blindness occurred first in late Stage 2, followed b...|$|E
40|$|Translational Vision and Neuroscience Research PanelSpontaneous {{neurologic}} {{diseases are}} common in dogs and frequently there is a genetic predisposition. Advances in canine genomics {{and the nature of}} <b>pure-bred</b> <b>dog</b> populations make it possible to efficiently map and sequence the genes responsible. In contrast to transgenic rodent models, investigations into spontaneous canine disease start with a recognized disease process and work from there to the contribution of genetics to that disease. Thus there is never a question whether the findings will be relevant to real world disease since that is where we start. Once a disease has been characterized and the genes responsible identified, either the clinical population or a research colony can be utilized to investigate the pathogenesis of disease or to conduct therapeutic trials. The larger size and complexity of the brain in dogs compared with rodents can make the canine model more predictive of outcome in human trials in modalities such as gene, stem cell, or enzyme replacement therapies. The Comparative Neurology Program at the University of Missouri, College of Veterinary Medicine has applied this approach to identify the genes responsible for numerous developmental and degenerative diseases of the nervous system. These include seizures disorders, inborn errors of metabolism, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and parkinsonism; and we continue to identify new diseases regularly through our clinical practice and our relationship with other veterinary neurologist and neurosurgeons throughout the world...|$|E

In all, 457 litters were registered, of which 414 (90 - 6 per cent) {{were involved in the}} study. The 414 litters contained 2629 puppies, a mean litter size of 6 - 4 puppies. Of the 2629 puppies 571 (21 - 7 per cent) died or were euthanased before they were weaned at 50 days of age; there were 147 (25 - 7 per cent) stillbirths; 102 (17 - 9 per cent) were euthanased because they were white; 269 (47 - 1 per cent) of the puppies died during the first 21 days of life and 53 (9 - 3 per cent) puppies died between days 22 and 50. The cause of death or the reason for euthanasia was assessed by either the breeder or the veterinarian in 176 of these 269 puppies but was not determined in the other 93 puppies. Three hundred and two puppies were examined postmortem; the most impor-tant causes of death or reasons for euthanasia were inflamma-tory disorders (102; 33 - 8 per cent), non-inflammatory disor-ders such as asphyxia and malnutrition (66; 21 - 9 per cent), euthanasia because they were white (51; 16 - 9 per cent), and congenital abnormalities (45; 14 - 9 per cent). No cause of death or reason for euthanasia could be found for 38 puppies (12 - 6 per cent). PUPPY mortality not only has financial and emotional conse-quences for breeders and veterinarians, but may also have an impact on a breeding programme. Furthermore, records of puppy mortality can be considered to provide a realistic indication of success in dog breeding.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 105 - 111). Microsatellite markers {{were used}} to measure genetic diversity and population differentiation within and between domestic dog breeds. The German Shepherd Dog was compared with typical outbred mongrel dogs, Dachshunds, Staffordshire Bull Terriers and a cohort of other pedigreed dogs representing 30 recognised breeds. Although archaeological records report that grey wolves (Canis lupus) were domesticated approximately 14 000 years ago, mtDNA analysis suggests that domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) and grey wolves diverged in multiple events over 100 000 years ago. Subsequently, the movement of humans and their dogs resulted in extensive gene ﬂow between dog populations for thousands of years. Breeding practices to obtain distinctive pnenotypic uniformity were recently introduced, resulting in <b>pure-bred</b> <b>dogs</b> becoming essentially closed gene pools. However, further mtDNA analyses have reported unexpectedly high levels of variability, supported by microsatellite loci with heterogeneities of between 36 % and 55 % being reported for some dog breeds. Microsatellite analyses of 15 polymorphic canine loci are reported. German Shepherd Dogs and outbred mongrel dogs expressed diversity values of 4. 0 alleles per locus in the former and 6. 4 in the later (corrected for population size by jack-kniﬁng with 1 000 pseudoreplications), with expected heterozygosities of 62 % and 83 %, respectively. German Shepherd Dogs showed a moderate loss of genetic diversity relative to outbred dogs, but not sufficient to describe the breed as highly inbred. However, in comparison with other <b>pure-bred</b> <b>dogs</b> examined, they expressed the least genetic diversity, with Dachshunds having 5. 2, Staffordshire Bull Terriers 4. 8 and the composite group of pedigreed dogs 6. 0 alleles per locus, with expected heterozygosities of 72 %, 67 % and 80 %, respectively. Signiﬁcant population differentiation (GST = 0. 103; RST = 0. 058) between German Shepherd Dogs and the outbred dogs illustrates the effect of genetic drift since the breed was established just over 100 years ago. This study would beneﬁt future breeding programs, as management should be facilitated by knowledge of relative measures of inbreeding and differentiation, especially between various separate breeding stocks within the breed...|$|R

40|$|Linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping is {{commonly}} used as a fine mapping tool in human genome mapping and has been used with some success for initial disease gene isolation in certain isolated inbred human populations. An understanding of the population history of domestic dog breeds suggests that LD mapping could be routinely utilized in this species for initial genome-wide scans.

40|$|AbstractSpecific polymorphisms in the {{endoplasmic}} reticulum amino peptidase genes ERAP 1 and ERAP 2, when present with certain MHC class receptor types, {{have been associated}} with increased risk for specific cancers, infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders in humans. This increased risk has been linked to distinct polymorphisms in both ERAPs and MHC class I receptors that affect the way cell-generated peptides are screened for antigenicity. The incidence of cancer, infectious disease and autoimmune disorders differ greatly among pure breeds of dogs as it does in humans and it is possible that this heightened susceptibility is also due to specific polymorphisms in ERAP 1 and ERAP 2. In order to determine if such polymorphisms exist, the ERAP 1 and ERAP 2 genes of 10 dogs of nine diverse breeds were sequenced and SNPs causing synonymous or non-synonymous amino acid changes, deletions or insertions were identified. Eight ERAP 1 and 10 ERAP 2 SNPs were used to create a Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX based test panel which defined 24 ERAP 1, 36 ERAP 2 and 128 ERAP 1 / 2 haplotypes. The prevalence of these haplotypes was then measured among dog, wolf, coyote, jackal and red fox populations. Some haplotypes were species specific, while others were shared across species, especially between dog, wolf, coyote and jackal. The prevalence of these haplotypes was then compared among various canid populations, and in particular between various populations of random- and <b>pure-bred</b> <b>dogs.</b> Human-directed positive selection has led to loss of ERAP diversity and segregation of certain haplotypes among various dog breeds.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of diets containing 18 % or 34 % protein on glomerular mesangial area (GMA) and basement membrane thickness (GBMT) in uninephrectomized aged dogs. A secondary objective was to determine the combined effects of aging and uninephrectomy on GMA and GBMT in dogs. Ten clinically healthy, <b>pure-bred</b> <b>dogs</b> were unilaterally nephrectomized at about 8 y of age. After 2 mo, 5 dogs were fed an 18 % protein diet and 5 dogs were fed a 34 % protein diet for 48 mo. At month 48, the dogs were euthanized and the remaining kidney was collected. Samples of kidney from both times of collection were used to measure GMA and GBMT using electron microscopy. The effects of diet on GMA and GBMT were analyzed (student's t-test) using necropsy/nephrectomy score ratios. The effects of time-nephrectomy were determined by comparing nephrectomy values for GMA and GBMT with necropsy values (paired t-test). Dogs fed 34 % dietary protein did not have a significant increase in GMA and GBM thickness when compared to dogs fed the 18 % protein diet. A significant increase in GMA and GBMT occurred with time-nephrectomy (P = 0. 011 and 0. 018, respectively). Although dietary protein intake was not a significant factor in causing structural changes to glomeruli in uninephrectomized aged dogs, the power to detect a difference was low. However, significant effects of aging and nephrectomy were detected despite the low power of the study. These results suggest that the increases in GMA and GBMT that occur over time are not markedly influenced by dietary protein intake. However, subtle protein effects cannot be eliminated as a possibility based on this study...|$|R
