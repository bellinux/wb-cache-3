40|$|Human T-cell leukemia virus- 1 (HTLV- 1) is {{the first}} <b>pathogenic</b> <b>human</b> <b>retrovirus</b> {{identified}} in 1979 by the Gallo group. HTLV- 1 causes fatal T-cell leukemia (adult T cell leukemia) and a progressive myelopahy (HTLV- 1 -associated myelopathy/ tropical spastic paraparesis, HAM/TSP) and other disorders. Since the discovery of HTLV- 1, several other microorganisms are demonstrated to cause cancer in humans. In this article, we investigated the oncogenic capacity of HTLV- 1, in comparison {{with those of other}} oncoviruses and one oncobacterium (Helicobacter pylori, H. Pylori) based on published literature. We conclude here that HTLV- 1 {{is one of the most}} and may be the most carcinogenic among them and arguably one of the most potent of the known human carcinogens. This fact has not been noted before and is particularly important to justify why we need to study HTLV- 1 as an important model of human viral oncogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Retroviral vectors {{have been}} {{successfully}} used therapeutically to restore expression of genes {{in a range of}} single-gene diseases, including several primary immunodeficiency disorders. Although clinical trials have shown remarkable results, there have also been a number of severe adverse events involving malignant outgrowth of a transformed clonal population. This clonal expansion is influenced by the integration site profile of the viral integrase, the transgene expressed, and the effect of the viral promoters on the neighbouring host genome. Infection with the <b>pathogenic</b> <b>human</b> <b>retrovirus</b> HTLV- 1 also causes clonal expansion of cells containing an integrated HTLV- 1 provirus. Although the majority of HTLV- 1 -infected people remain asymptomatic, up to 5 % develop an aggressive T cell malignancy. In this review we discuss recent findings {{on the role of the}} genomic integration site in determining the clonality and the potential for malignant transformation of cells carrying integrated HTLV- 1 or gene therapy vectors, and how these results have contributed to the understanding of HTLV- 1 pathogenesis and to improvements in gene therapy vector safety...|$|E
40|$|The {{acquired}} immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) {{is thought}} to result from infection of T cells by a <b>pathogenic</b> <b>human</b> <b>retrovirus,</b> human T-lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III) or lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV). In this report, we describe the antiviral effects of a thymidine analogue, 3 '-azido- 3 '-deoxythymidine (BW A 509 U), which, as a triphosphate, inhibits the reverse transcriptase of HTLV-III/LAV. This agent blocks {{the expression of the}} p 24 gag protein of HTLV-III/LAV in H 9 cells following exposure to virus. The drug also inhibits the cytopathic effect of HTLV-IIIB (a virus derived from a pool of American patients) and HTLV-III/RF-II (an isolate obtained from a Haitian patient that differs by about 20 % in the amino acid sequence of the envelope gene from several isolates of HTLV-III/LAV, including HTLV-IIIB, analyzed so far). 3 '-Azido- 3 '-deoxythymidine also completely blocks viral replication as assessed by reverse transcriptase production in normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to HTLV-IIIB. Finally, at concentrations of 3 '-azido- 3 '-deoxythymidine that block the in vitro infectivity and cytopathic effect of HTLV-IIIB, the in vitro immune functions of normal T cells remain basically intact...|$|E

40|$|Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) Rex {{and human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) Rev are essential gene products required for the replication of these two <b>pathogenic</b> <b>human</b> <b>retroviruses.</b> Both Rex and Rev act at a posttranscriptional level by binding to highly structured RNA-response elements, the Rex-response element in HTLV-I and the Rev-response element in HIV- 1. Using a sensitive in vivo assay of protein-protein interaction, we now demonstrate that the HTLV-I Rex and HIV- 1 Rev proteins readily form homomultimeric complexes {{in the absence of}} their cognate RNA-response elements yet fail to form heteromultimeric complexes with each other. Dominant negative mutations have been identified in both the rex and rev genes which presumably specify a critical activation or effector domain in each of these viral transactivators. Surprisingly, these dominant negative mutants of Rex and Rev fail to interact in vivo. These findings raise the possibility that the binding of nonfunctional monomers rather than functional multimers underlies the transdominant phenotype of these Rex and Rev mutants. Further, {{it seems likely that the}} assembly of functional and stable multimers of Rex and Rev in vivo may depend not only on the intrinsic multimerization domains of these proteins but also on the binding of a bridging cellular cofactor to the related activation domains present in each viral transactivator...|$|R

Counterparts of both of these <b>pathogenic</b> <b>human</b> <b>retroviruses</b> {{have been identified in}} various simian species indigenous to Asia and Africa, including sooty mangabey monkeys (Cercocebus atys). Using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a mangabey naturally infected with both SIV and STLV-I, T-cell lines were established and maintained continuously for more than 3 years; these cell lines harbored only a newly identified mangabey STLV-I(sm) or both STLV-I(sm) and the acutely lethal variant SIVsmmPBj 14. The dually infected cell line (FEd-P 14) was established byde novoinfection of mangabey PBMC with SIVsmmPBj 14. This cell line was characterized by multiple assays which showed that structural proteins encoded by both viruses were produced in large quantities, but that the predominant viral glycoprotein on the cell surface was the STLV-I(sm) Env. Unusual interactions of the two retroviral glycoproteins were suggested by the formation of syncytia between Raji and the FEd-P 14 cells, but not between Raji and simian cells infected with only one <b>retrovirus</b> or <b>human</b> cells infected with HTLV-I. The STLV-I(sm) strain obtained from the sooty mangabey was transmitted to normal macaque and mangabey PBMC and was shown to be unique by sequencing of the entireenvgene. STLV-I(sm) from this African species was more closely related to “cosmopolitan” HTLV-I strains than to the prototypic STLV-I from an Asian pig-tailed macaque. In vitroandin vivostudies of STLV-I(sm) and SIVsmm, both isolated from a naturally infected mangabey monkey, may provide insight into disease induction and manifestations associated with coinfection by their human counterparts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Each of the <b>pathogenic</b> <b>human</b> <b>retroviruses</b> (HIV- 1 / 2 and HTLV- 1) has a nonhuman primate counterpart, and the {{presence}} of these <b>retroviruses</b> in <b>humans</b> results from interspecies transmission. The passage of another simian retrovirus, simian foamy virus (SFV), from apes or monkeys to humans has been reported. Mandrillus sphinx, a monkey species living in central Africa, is naturally infected with SFV. We evaluated the natural history of the virus in a free-ranging colony of mandrills and investigated possible transmission of mandrill SFV to humans. Results We studied 84 semi-free-ranging captive mandrills at the Primate Centre of the Centre International de Recherches Médicales de Franceville (Gabon) and 15 wild mandrills caught in various areas of the country. The presence of SFV was also evaluated in 20 people who worked closely with mandrills and other nonhuman primates. SFV infection was determined by specific serological (Western blot) and molecular (nested PCR of the integrase region in the polymerase gene) assays. Seropositivity for SFV was found in 70 / 84 (83 %) captive and 9 / 15 (60 %) wild-caught mandrills and in 2 / 20 (10 %) humans. The 425 -bp SFV integrase fragment was detected in peripheral blood DNA from 53 captive and 8 wild-caught mandrills and in two personnel. Sequence and phylogenetic studies demonstrated {{the presence}} of two distinct strains of mandrill SFV, one clade including SFVs from mandrills living {{in the northern part of}} Gabon and the second consisting of SFV from animals living in the south. One man who had been bitten 10 years earlier by a mandrill and another bitten 22 years earlier by a macaque were found to be SFV infected, both at the Primate Centre. The second man had a sequence close to SFVmac sequences. Comparative sequence analysis of the virus from the first man and from the mandrill showed nearly identical sequences, indicating genetic stability of SFV over time. Conclusion Our results show a high prevalence of SFV infection in a semi-free-ranging colony of mandrills, with the presence of two different strains. We also showed transmission of SFV from a mandrill and a macaque to humans. </p...|$|R

For the <b>pathogenic</b> <b>retrovirus</b> <b>human</b> immunodeficiency virus type- 1 (HIV- 1), these include widely expressed restriction factors 1 such as APOBEC 3 proteins 2, TRIM 5 α 3, tetherin/BST 24, 5 and SAMHD 16, 7, {{as well as}} additional factors that are stimulated by type- 1 interferon (IFN) 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

40|$|The {{expression}} and incorporation of retroviral enzymes into virions {{in the form}} of Gag/Pol precursor polyproteins is believed to be important for the assembly of infectious viral particles. HIV- 1 encodes a 160 kDa Gag/Pol precursor that includes Gag, protease (PR), reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN). We have developed the use of HIV accessory proteins (Vpr and Vpx) as vehicles to incorporate protein of both viral and non-viral origin into virions by expression in trans as heterologous fusion proteins (Wu et al., 1995, 1996 a). To analyze the role of Gag/Pol in the formation of infectious virions, we incorporated RT and IN into HIV- 1 particles in trans, as fusion partners of viral protein R (Vpr). Virions derived from an RT and IN minus proviral clone were infectious and replicated through a complete cycle of infection when RT and IN proteins were provided in trans. These results demonstrate that functional RT and IN proteins can be provided in trans, and that their {{expression and}} incorporation into virions as components of Gag/Pol are not required for the formation of infectious virions. Thus, for the first time, we have demonstrated for a <b>human</b> <b>pathogenic</b> <b>retrovirus</b> that processes of assembly and the function of critical viral enzymes can be unlinked. This finding will provide unique opportunities to explore retroviral RT/IN function and the role of Gag/Pol in the formation of infectious virions {{in the context of a}} replicating virus (in vivo) ...|$|R
