50|$|It {{seemed that}} Nick Harrison (Karl Burnett) {{was wrong about}} his earlier doubts about Dr. Ian Seymour's (David <b>Press)</b> <b>character</b> and instead wholeheartedly {{accepted}} his mother Jenny Harrison's (Maggie Harper) new relationship. Several months later, Kirsty began to suspect that Ian was planning {{to take over the}} clinic and vowed to expose him. She managed to foil Ian's sabotage of a project proposal but didn't have the proof she needed to full expose Ian. Frustrated, Kirsty threw himself into a relationship with Dr. Gus van de Berg (Aaron Devitt), who soon began having an affair with the now completely alcoholic and off-the-rails Rachel. After a series of accidents that saw her nearly drown in a pool, and crash her car drunk driving, Nick, instead of bailing her out of jail, called her Father Michael McKenna, a former alcoholic himself, and forced Rachel to deal with her problems.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{accordance}} with the obvious characteristics of the <b>pressed</b> raised <b>character</b> image and the shortages of the template matching method. a new method of using the general radial-basis function neural network (GRBFN) for testing {{the quality of the}} <b>pressed</b> <b>character</b> is presented. The structures and training methods of GRBFN are fully analyzed, as well as the functionality of hidden layer, excited focus and area. The results show the checker based on GRBFN has highly checking ratio for the label <b>pressed</b> raised <b>characters.</b> It is suited to the quality testing of raised characters...|$|R
50|$|The stories where {{typical of}} the Boys Own fare of the era, with adventure, detective and western stories predominating. Several Amalgamated <b>Press</b> <b>characters</b> such as Sexton Blake, Nelson Lee, Jack, Sam & Pete and Buffalo Bill appeared, in either serials or {{complete}} stories. Later issues featured stories of Jimmy Silver of Rookwood School, written by Charles Hamilton, creator of Billy Bunter.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To {{improve the}} edge {{detecting}} {{effect of the}} <b>pressed</b> <b>character,</b> a novel method based on facet model and topographic structures is proposed. Firstly, the discrete gray scale image is approximated by a bivariate cubic function, then, the concerned features of the continuous function are computed to describe the discrete image. After every pixel in the image has been defined to Peak, Ridge, Saddle, Flat, Ravine, Pit or Hillside, {{the edge of the}} character is detected. To reduce the time in computing the coefficients of cubic function, an efficient separable algorithm is presented. In addition, an image enhancement method prior to edge detection is adopted to improve the detecting effect. The tests show that the proposed method is more suitable for complex edge detecting problems than common methods...|$|R
50|$|Imre Horváth is {{the head}} of a Hungarian {{publishing}} house that has been in his family for six generations. He escaped Hungary in 1956 and began a new publishing house in Vienna. After the fall of Communism, he wishes to return home and restart the <b>press.</b> Other <b>characters</b> see him as a silly, self-important old man.|$|R
2500|$|Like other Antarctic <b>Press</b> <b>characters,</b> {{action figures}} {{containing}} {{most of the}} chief characters in various colors and designs were made. However, {{in addition to the}} standard look, there was also an anime look based on a failed attempt by Ben Dunn and Antarctic Press to make a Warrior Nun Areala American anime in 1994. There were high hopes and would have been partially fan funded with contributors donating $125 in exchange for their names in the credits. However, that never panned out with the money necessary for Sunrise, the hoped for animation studio, to make the series being about $200,000. In 2001 another attempt was made by Darkain Arts though that too failed. The anime was never completed and only the opening credits are known to exist; they were created by the animators of the X-Men animated series. The opening credits can be seen on [...]|$|R

The paper presses forward against a ribbon which then <b>presses</b> against the <b>character</b> form and the impression of the character form is printed onto the paper.|$|R
2500|$|In 1899, {{her second}} novel, The Awakening, was published. It {{generated}} {{a significant amount}} of negative <b>press</b> because its <b>characters,</b> especially the women, behaved in ways that conflicted with current standards of acceptable ladylike behavior.

For example, holding down [...] while {{pressing}} [...] will create a highlighted grave accent which {{will be added to}} the next letter if possible - so if an [...] is then <b>pressed,</b> the resultant <b>character</b> is è. If an [...] is pressed instead, the two characters are not compatible so the result is `r.|$|R
25|$|Pairing a Bluetooth {{keyboard}} {{with the}} tvOS on the Apple TV enables another accessibility feature that {{also is an}} incorporation of VoiceOver. When typing, VoiceOver mirrors with an audio voice, each <b>character</b> <b>pressed</b> on the keyboard and repeated again when it is entered. The Apple TV is designed {{to work with the}} Apple Wireless Keyboard or the Apple Magic Keyboard. It will work however with almost any brand of Bluetooth keyboard.|$|R
50|$|In 1828, {{the order}} of the {{characters}} in a chart and the shapes of the characters were modified by Cherokee author and editor Elias Boudinot to adapt the syllabary to printing <b>presses.</b> The 86th <b>character</b> was dropped entirely. Following these changes, the syllabary was adopted by the Cherokee Phoenix newspaper, later Cherokee Advocate, followed by the Cherokee Messenger, a bilingual paper printed in Indian Territory in the mid-19th century.|$|R

50|$|The movie takes a {{cinematic}} {{swipe at}} Jackie Chan, with whom director Wong Jing had worked previously on the City Hunter live-action film. After {{the release of}} City Hunter, Chan not only disowned the film, but attacked Wong personally in the <b>press.</b> Through the <b>character</b> of Frankie Lone, Wong insinuated that Chan was actually a boozing womanizer and a fraud who did not really do his own stunts after all.|$|R
50|$|The Squander Bug was a World War II {{propaganda}} character {{created by}} the British National Savings Committee to discourage wasteful spending. Originally designed by freelance illustrator Phillip Boydell for <b>press</b> adverts, the <b>character</b> was widely used by other wartime artists in poster campaigns and political cartoons. It {{is one of the}} few propaganda campaigns from World War II to be fully documented from the original concept sketches to the finished adverts.|$|R
5000|$|The player uses a four-position {{joystick}} and {{a single}} button to control Pengo, a penguin <b>character.</b> <b>Pressing</b> the button while pushing the joystick against an ice block will cause it to slide in that direction until it hits another block or a wall, if the space directly ahead of it is unoccupied by a block or wall.

5000|$|Unlike the {{flamboyant}} Apollo Creed and the brash James [...] "Clubber" [...] Lang—Rocky's opponents in previous films—Ivan Drago is quiet and non-boastful. Driven by {{his desire to}} be the best at all costs, this single-minded manner in which he pursues this goal deprives him of his humanity. Many viewers and critics have suggested that Drago was meant to symbolize America's perception of Russia: immense, powerful, and emotionless. This is made evident by his cold-blooded pulverization of Creed in an exhibition match as well as by his callous reaction towards news of his opponent's death. Drago generally allows his wife and trainers to talk on his behalf to the <b>press.</b> The <b>character</b> only speaks short sentences, throughout the film, all terse, short statements.|$|R
25|$|In Singapore, where Chinese {{is one of}} the {{official}} languages, simplified characters are {{the official}} standard and used in all official publications as well as government-controlled <b>press.</b> While simplified <b>characters</b> are taught exclusively in schools, the government does not officially discourage the use of traditional characters. While all official publications are in simplified characters, the government still allows parents to choose whether to have their child's Chinese name registered in simplified or traditional characters.|$|R

30|$|Characters {{are one of}} {{the main}} methods for {{information}} identification, recording, and storage. Metal stamping characters (MSCs) are widely used in the identification of industrial products because they are hard to alter and permanently preserved. The high-quality automation of character recognition on industrial products is highly desirable in the manufacturing and periodic inspection of these products. Inspection is performed at various production stages. It is clear that the earlier method of using human inspectors, however, misses a considerable number of defects because humans are unsuitable for such simple and repetitive tasks. Automated vision inspection can be a good alternative to reduce human workload and labor costs as well as to improve inspection accuracy and throughput. Unfortunately, MSCs constantly change over time and vary through the manufacturing process flow. For example, spray paint and other similar processing cause the color of the characters to vary process by process. Because the colors of the MSCs are generally similar to the background, the contrast between the two regions is very low. Besides, annealing, incineration, and other processes, as well as stacking or service over the long term, will produce oxide scale or rust on the metal surface that further reduces the contrast between the characters and the background; sometimes, such characters are hard to distinguish even with the human eyes. Finally, hydraulic oil stains, shot-blasting process, the spatter of welding slag, electrostatic adsorption of iron powder, and other artifacts of the product manufacturing and service process also obscure the <b>pressed</b> <b>characters</b> and reduce the image quality. The traditional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques, such as text recognition [1 – 3], license plate recognition [4 – 6], and ID card identification [7, 8], have been developed for decades and achieved great success in different commercial systems. But most of them are designed for images with high quality and often fail to produce good results when applied for MSCs. To adapt to the development and promotion of intelligent manufacturing technology, achieving OCR for MSCs is particularly important.|$|R
50|$|In common usage, {{the name}} Letraset {{originally}} referred to sheets of transfer lettering which was originally manufactured as a wet process in 1959, with each character selected and {{cut from a}} sheet, placed face-down on a small silk screen frame and wetted with a paint brush to soften and release the gum arabic adhesive which held it. The frame was then turned over and the letter located over the artwork, and the <b>character</b> <b>pressed</b> {{into contact with the}} page, with the mounting base slid away as with model aircraft transfers.|$|R
