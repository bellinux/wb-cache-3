Kurtzman wanted to work on the Spider-Man film franchise, while Orci was linked to the directorial role for Star Trek 3. Orci confirmed later that year in July that he was not involved in the production of The Amazing Spider-Man 3 alongside Kurtzman. Orci and Kurtzman's K/O <b>Paper</b> <b>Products</b> continues to operate as a production company within CBS Television Studios, and has created the series Scorpion inspired by the life of Walter O'Brien for the 2014-15 season and Limitless was created for the 2015-16 season from the 2011 film.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to find out how business-to-business companies are using social me- dia through a case study of global forest and <b>paper</b> <b>product</b> companies' use of Twitter. Previous social media research has placed focus on business-to-consumer types of organizations and this study aims to add to research of business-to-business types of organizations' use of social media through study of Twitter content. The intention {{of this study is to}} answer two main research questions and two sub questions. The first main research question: (1) How do forest and <b>paper</b> <b>product</b> companies use Twitter?, is an- swered by two sub questions: (1 a) What different types of content do forest and <b>paper</b> <b>product</b> companies publish on Twitter?, and, (1 b) Do forest and <b>paper</b> <b>product</b> companies use elements that support interaction on Twitter? The second research question asks: (2) Are there differences between North American and Northern European companies? This research project uses a quantitative content analysis to study the content of tweets and find differences between the chosen companies. This study looks at the 713 tweets published by 16 for- est and <b>paper</b> <b>product</b> companies from Canada, Finland, Sweden and the United States of Ameri- ca. Dialogic principles are used to study the use of interaction supporting elements. The main use of Twitter as a communication channel is defined through three main categories composed of fif- teen individual tweet types. The main findings of this study are: (1) forest and <b>paper</b> <b>product</b> companies use Twitter to in- form the public, (2) forest and <b>paper</b> <b>product</b> companies use interaction supporting elements in their tweets and (3) North American forest and <b>paper</b> <b>product</b> companies use Twitter to build rap- port and interact with the public and (4) Northern European forest and <b>paper</b> <b>product</b> companies use Twitter to inform the public. These findings implicate that (1) the nationality of a company affects the use of social media, (2) Twitter is not used for mobilization of audiences and (3) business-to-business companies use in- formation messages to both inform and spread a positive image of themselves to the public...|$|R
5|$|Logging {{remained}} {{a mainstay of}} industry in Missoula with the groundbreaking of the Hoerner-Waldorf pulp mill in 1956, which resulted in protests over the resultant air pollution. An article in Life magazine thirteen years later speaks of Missoulians sometimes needing to drive with headlights on during the day to navigate through the smog. In 1979, still almost 40% of the county's labor income came from the wood and <b>paper</b> <b>products</b> sector. The lumber industry was hit hard by the recession of the early 1980s, and Missoula's economy began to diversify. By the early 1990s, the disappearance {{of many of the}} region's log yards, along with legislation, had helped clean the skies dramatically.|$|E
5|$|Sawtooth National Forest {{balances}} {{interests of}} different groups, {{such as those}} interested in recreation, preservation, or resource extraction. The forest practices conservation of resources, in some areas allowing for production of raw materials, such as lumber for construction purposes and wood pulp for <b>paper</b> <b>products,</b> alongside recreational uses, while in other areas only recreation is permitted. Additionally, mineral extraction through mining and {{oil and natural gas}} exploration and recovery are also conducted, though in Sawtooth National Forest this has become less common due to a consensus to protect the natural surroundings. Leases offered to ranchers to allow them to graze cattle and sheep on the forest are common. The forest provides guidelines and enforces environmental regulations to ensure that resources are not overexploited and that necessary commodities are available for future generations.|$|E
5|$|In the 1994 U.S. Senate {{election}} in Massachusetts, Kennedy faced his first serious challenger, the young, telegenic, and very well-funded Mitt Romney. Romney ran {{as a successful}} entrepreneur and Washington outsider with a strong family image and moderate stands on social issues, while Kennedy was saddled not only with his recent past but the 25th anniversary of Chappaquiddick and his first wife Joan seeking a renegotiated divorce settlement. By mid-September 1994, polls showed the race to be even. Kennedy's campaign ran short on money, and belying his image as endlessly wealthy, {{he was forced to}} take out a second mortgage on his Virginia home. Kennedy responded with a series of attack ads, which focused both on Romney's shifting political views and on the treatment of workers at a <b>paper</b> <b>products</b> plant owned by Romney's Bain Capital. Kennedy's new wife Vicki proved to be a strong asset in campaigning. Kennedy and Romney held a widely watched late October debate without a clear winner, but by then Kennedy had pulled ahead in polls and stayed ahead afterward. In the November election, despite a very bad outcome for the Democratic Party nationally, Kennedy won re-election by a 58percent to 41percent margin, the closest re-election race of his career.|$|E
