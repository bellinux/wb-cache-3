In the 6th centuryAD the hill top was entirely abandoned and was used only for agriculture during the medieval period.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{and ships}} headed from Milne Bay to Buna {{and vice versa}} had to pass close to Goodenough Island.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the war, the Ho-Chunk tribe was {{compelled}} to cede the lead mining region to the United States. The Americans also increased their military <b>presence</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> frontier, building Fort Winnebago and reoccupying two other abandoned forts. The conflict convinced some officials that Americans and Indians could not live peaceably together, and that the Natives should be compelled to move westward, a policy known as Indian removal. The Winnebago War preceded the larger Black Hawk War of 1832, which involved many of the same people and concerned similar issues.|$|E

5|$|For a time, the Australian Voluntary Hospital was {{the only}} Australian <b>presence</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Western Front, but in April 1916, Australian Army units began {{arriving}} from the Middle East in large numbers. The Australian Voluntary Hospital's site in Wimereux {{was taken over by}} No. 3 Australian General Hospital, AIF in June 1916. The Australian Voluntary Hospital was then absorbed into the British Army as No. 32 Stationary Hospital, with Eames remaining in command. By 1 May 1919, the hospital had treated 73,868 patients.|$|E

5|$|Lifting off and {{entering}} orbit, Ross attempts to dock with Phoenix. However, Doppelganger experiences a technical malfunction. The shuttle detaches from Phoenix and falls {{through the atmosphere}} towards the Space Centre.

40|$|International {{trade in}} {{services}} has grown, year after year, in importance in the world economy. The trade with services undergoes a more accelerated ascension than the one with goods, but it still holds less than 20 % of the global trade {{partly due to the}} barriers of entrance <b>on</b> <b>the</b> market. However, the foreign direct investments (FDI) in services are superior to those from the manufactory sector because of the growth of the efforts made by the traders in order to establish some commercial <b>presences</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> foreign markets. The liberalization of the international trade with services is likely to generate substantial benefits concerning the prosperity and the economical growth...|$|R
5|$|Nominally {{based in}} Alaska, the Sea-based X-band Radar (SBX-1) arrived on Ford Island in 2006 for {{maintenance}} and repairs and has returned several times since. Primarily used as a warhead-detection radar system on a self-propelled floating platform in the Pacific, its <b>presence</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island has been controversial. The platform, with a cost reaching nearly , has never actually made it to Alaska and conspiracy theorists argue that the platform is a mobile version of the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, the Portuguese <b>presence</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Angolan coast {{remained}} limited {{for much}} of the colonial period. The degree of real colonial settlement was minor, and, with few exceptions, the Portuguese did not interfere by means other than commercial in the social and political dynamics of the native peoples. There was no real delimitation of territory; Angola, to all intents and purposes, did not yet exist.|$|E
5|$|On Lake Champlain, Benedict Arnold {{supervised}} {{the construction of}} 12 vessels to protect access into Hudson River's uppermost navigable reaches from advancing British forces. A British fleet destroyed Arnold's in the Battle of Valcour Island, but the fleet's <b>presence</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lake managed {{to slow down the}} British progression enough until winter came before they were able capture Fort Ticonderoga. By mid-1776, a number of ships, ranging up to and including the thirteen frigates approved by Congress, were under construction, but their effectiveness was limited; they were completely outmatched by the mighty Royal Navy, and nearly all were captured or sunk by 1781.|$|E

5|$|Other headgroups {{are also}} present {{to varying degrees}} and can include {{phosphatidylserine}} (PS) phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG). These alternate headgroups often confer specific biological functionality that is highly context-dependent. For instance, PS <b>presence</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> extracellular membrane face of erythrocytes is a marker of cell apoptosis, whereas PS in growth plate vesicles {{is necessary for the}} nucleation of hydroxyapatite crystals and subsequent bone mineralization. Unlike PC, some of the other headgroups carry a net charge, which can alter the electrostatic interactions of small molecules with the bilayer.|$|E
5|$|Russia saw the Black Sea {{coast and}} {{the border with}} Turkey as {{invaluable}} strategic attributes of Georgia. Russia had more vested interests in Abkhazia than in South Ossetia, since the Russian military <b>presence</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Black Sea coast was seen as vital to Russian influence in the Black Sea. Before the early 2000s, South Ossetia was originally intended {{as a tool to}} retain a grip on Georgia.|$|E

Of the nine hamlets that were mapped in 1801, seven of the names are of Norse origin.|$|E
50|$|Because Jesus Christ is a person, theologies {{regarding}} the Eucharist involve {{consideration of the}} way in which the communicant's personal relationship with God is fed through this mystical meal.
