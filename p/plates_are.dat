5|$|Millipede bodies may be {{flattened}} or cylindrical, and {{are composed}} of numerous metemeric segments, each with an exoskeleton consisting of five chitinous plates: a single plate above (the tergite), one at each side (pleurites), and a plate on the underside (sternite) where the legs attach. In many millipedes, these <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> fused to varying degrees, sometimes forming a single cylindrical ring. The <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> typically hard, being impregnated with calcium salts. Because they lack a waxy cuticle, millipedes are susceptible to water loss and must {{spend most of their}} time in moist or humid environments.|$|E
5|$|Garter stall <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> small {{enamelled}} and engraved brass plates {{located in}} St George's Chapel as memorials to Knights of the Garter. They are inscribed with the knight's name, and generally with his titles, offices, and motto. In most cases his heraldic achievement is depicted.|$|E
5|$|The broad head is {{distinct}} from the neck, and the snout is blunt in profile with {{the rim of the}} top of the head extending forwards slightly further than the mouth. Substantial cranial <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> present, although the parietal <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> often fragmented, especially towards the rear. A loreal scale is absent. Six to 9 supralabials and eight to 12 infralabials are seen. At midbody, there are 23–27 rows of dorsal scales. All dorsal scale rows have keels, although those on the lowermost scale rows are weak. In males/females, the ventral scales number 130-145/128-144 and the subcaudals 38-54/36-50. Many of the latter may be divided.|$|E
50|$|Military <b>plates</b> <b>was</b> white-on-black, while police <b>plates</b> <b>was</b> white-on-blue. Volunteer {{military}} organization <b>plates</b> <b>was</b> colored white-on-dark green.|$|R
50|$|The 1915 <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> made of re-enforced metal. The 1918 <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> {{made of a}} heavy steel, {{of which}} some were embossed. In 1919, {{porcelain}} enamelled iron <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> issued, and were renewed yearly until 1922.|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{processing}} the experimental data to determine the pressure drop of dual-flow <b>plates,</b> criteria equations <b>were</b> obtained to determine the pressure drop of the gas-liquid layer on dual-flow <b>plates.</b> <b>Plates</b> <b>were</b> studied on model system «water – air». Free cross-section of <b>plates</b> <b>was</b> 16, 25 and 36 %, a diameter of the holes of <b>plates</b> <b>was</b> 0. 012 m, diameter of the <b>plates</b> <b>was</b> 0. 15 m</p...|$|R
5|$|The {{mechanically}} rigid {{outer layer}} of Earth, the lithosphere, {{is divided into}} pieces called tectonic plates. These <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> rigid segments that move in relation to one another at one of three types of plate boundaries: convergent boundaries, at which two plates come together, divergent boundaries, at which two <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> pulled apart, and transform boundaries, in which two plates slide past one another laterally. Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation can occur along these plate boundaries. The tectonic plates ride {{on top of the}} asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.|$|E
5|$|The {{zygomatic}} <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> {{almost completely}} vertical. As Winge already noted, the front {{margin of the}} zygomatic plate hardly extends forward before the antorbital bridge, which connects the plate {{to the body of}} the skull. This feature distinguishes J.anoblepas from Wilfredomys and many oryzomyines, but the zygomatic plate of living Juliomys species closely resembles that of J.anoblepas. In addition, the connection between the zygomatic plate and the antorbital bridge is inserted higher on the rostrum in Wilfredomys. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) spread broadly. More than in other Juliomys species, the front part of the zygomatic arches is bended forward and the zygomatic <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> bended outward. Furthermore, the zygomatic notch, the notch between the zygomatic plate and arch, is deep, not shallow as in J.ossitenuis and J.rimofrons.|$|E
5|$|Two rows of {{alternating}} plates. By {{the early}} 1960s, this had become (and remains) the prevalent idea, mainly because some S. stenops fossils {{in which the}} <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> still partially articulated show this arrangement. This arrangement is chiral and so demands that a specimen be distinguished from its distinct, hypothetical mirror-image form.|$|E
50|$|All state-issued <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> made {{of steel}} until 1947 when {{aluminum}} <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> introduced. With the exception of 1945, all <b>plates</b> have <b>been</b> issued in pairs since 1922.|$|R
50|$|At the beginning, <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> {{black with}} white or silver characters. Reflective <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> {{introduced}} in 1963 but only became compulsory on new cars in 1993. The new <b>plates</b> had to <b>be</b> {{white on the}} front and yellow on the rear until 2007, when white rear <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> allowed.|$|R
50|$|The Easter <b>Plate</b> <b>is</b> a small (550 km x 410 km) {{tectonic plate}} or {{microplate}} {{in the southeastern}} Pacific. The <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> bounded on the west by the Pacific Plate, and the east by the Nazca Plate. The entire <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> covered by the Pacific Ocean. Easter <b>Plate</b> <b>is</b> named after Easter Island which is {{to the east of}} it on the adjacent Nazca Plate.|$|R
5|$|Aetosaur fossil remains {{are known}} from Europe, North and South America, parts of Africa and India. Since their {{armoured}} <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> often preserved and are abundant in certain localities, aetosaurs serve as important Late Triassic tetrapod index fossils. Many aetosaurs had wide geographic ranges, but their stratigraphic ranges were relatively short. Therefore, {{the presence of}} particular aetosaurs can accurately date a site that they are found in.|$|E
5|$|In The Disasters of War, Goya {{does not}} excuse any purpose to the random slaughter—the <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> devoid of the {{consolation}} of divine order or the dispensation of human justice. This {{in part a}} result of the absence of melodrama or consciously artful presentation that would distance the viewer from the brutality of the subjects, as found in Baroque martyrdom. In addition, Goya refuses to offer the stability of traditional narrative. Instead, his composition tends to highlight the most disturbing aspects of each work.|$|E
5|$|In the laboratory, {{bacteria}} are usually grown using solid or liquid media. Solid growth media, such as agar <b>plates,</b> <b>are</b> used to isolate pure cultures of a bacterial strain. However, liquid growth media are used when measurement of growth or {{large volumes of}} cells are required. Growth in stirred liquid media occurs as an even cell suspension, making the cultures easy to divide and transfer, although isolating single bacteria from liquid media is difficult. The use of selective media (media with specific nutrients added or deficient, or with antibiotics added) can help identify specific organisms.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> revalidated for {{multiple}} years. For example, the 1947-dated <b>plate</b> <b>was</b> revalidated with metal tabs until 1950.|$|R
5000|$|The {{equilibrium}} equations for the <b>plate</b> can <b>be</b> {{derived from}} the principle of virtual work. For the situation where the strains and rotations of the <b>plate</b> <b>are</b> small, the equilibrium equations for an unloaded <b>plate</b> <b>are</b> given bywhere the stress resultants and stress moment resultants are defined asand {{the thickness of the}} <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> [...] The quantities [...] are the stresses.|$|R
50|$|In CTP, if {{for some}} reason a <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> damaged, if an error occurs when it's ripped or if {{something}} has to be corrected after the <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> exposed, a completely new, imposed <b>plate</b> must <b>be</b> created.|$|R
5|$|Large thin flat mineralized plates {{have been}} found next to the ribs' sides. Their {{function}} is unknown; they {{may have played a}} role in respiration. However, muscle scars or other indications of attachment have not been found for the plates, which argues against a respiratory function. Recent histological study of layered plates from a probable subadult indicates that they may have started as cartilage and became bone as the animal aged. Such <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> known from several other ornithopods and their cerapodan relatives.|$|E
5|$|NIF's laser uses {{a system}} of large flashtubes (like those in a {{photography}} flashlamp) to optically pump {{a large number of}} glass plates. Once the <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> flashed and have settled into a population inversion, a small signal from a separate laser is fed into the optical lines, stimulating the emission in the plates. The plates then dump their stored energy into the growing beam, amplifying it billions of times.|$|E
5|$|The {{photostability}} of pigments can {{be enhanced}} {{by the addition of}} cerium. It provides pigments with light fastness and prevents clear polymers from darkening in sunlight. Television glass <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> subject to electron bombardment, which tends to darken them by creation of F-center color centers. This effect is suppressed by addition of cerium oxide. Cerium is also an essential component of phosphors used in TV screens and fluorescent lamps. Cerium sulfide forms a red pigment that stays stable up to 350°C. The pigment is a nontoxic alternative to cadmium sulfide pigments.|$|E
30|$|Aluminum <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> {{suggested}} for OAF closures [61]. According to Steiner, 36 -gauge pure aluminum <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> {{used as a}} protective plate to aid in closure, using the same technique as in the gold procedure. Buccal and palatal tissues are approximated by sutures. Accordingly, the aluminum <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> constantly visible. After several weeks, the aluminum <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> removed from its initial position {{as a result of}} formation reparative tissue underneath. In addition to malleability and smoothness features, aluminum is inexpensive.|$|R
40|$|The {{transverse}} vibrations of {{a rectangular}} plate with the Kelvin type boundary conditions at four corners <b>are</b> investigated. The <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> modeled as being attached to four lumped spring-damper systems at the corners. An analytical procedure is proposed {{based on the}} modal analysis. The completely free case of the <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> first studied. The expressions for the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of the <b>plate</b> <b>are</b> obtained by utilizing the separation of variables. Then, the {{case in which the}} stiffness and the viscous damping as external forces acting at the corners of the <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> studied. Following the modal analysis procedure, the general solution for the equation of motion of the rectangular <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> derived. Some numerical results are presented...|$|R
50|$|Before 1979, {{the color}} of the <b>plates</b> <b>was</b> white on blue, without borders. In {{previous}} years, <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> all-numeric; now, both letters and numbers are used.|$|R
5|$|Although the {{zygomatic}} plates (plates of bone at {{the side}} of the skull) are variable, their size is generally intermediate for the Akodon boliviensis group and their front margin ranges from straight to a little concave. The zygomatic notches, projections at the front of the <b>plates,</b> <b>are</b> better developed than in A.caenosus and A.sylvanus. The incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate) are long, sometimes extending between the first upper molars. Tiny posterolateral palatal pits are located at the back of the palate. The back margin of the palate is squared to rounded, with a spine in the middle (medial process) sometimes present. The opening behind the palate, the mesopterygoid fossa, is of intermediate width, being narrower than in A.sylvanus, A.simulator, and A.budini but broader than in A.caenosus.|$|E
5|$|Both NEC tracks have {{high-level}} platforms, {{which were}} added in 2001 {{for use by}} Acela Express trains (which cannot use low platforms). The southbound NEC track is served by a low platform behind the station, {{which leads to a}} short high-level platform south of State Street. The northbound NEC track is served by a high-level platform behind the station building; the low platform south of State Street is generally only used for deboarding passengers from busy trains. Because of the sharp curve, the high-level platforms are set slightly back from the tracks to avoid scraping the ends of train cars, and thus bridge <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> needed to span the gap between platform and car.|$|E
5|$|Horses, {{particularly}} colts, {{sometimes are}} physically capable of reproduction at about 18months, but domesticated horses are rarely allowed to breed {{before the age}} of three, especially females. Horses four years old are considered mature, although the skeleton normally continues to develop until the age of six; maturation also depends on the horse's size, breed, sex, and quality of care. Larger horses have larger bones; therefore, not only do the bones take longer to form bone tissue, but the epiphyseal <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> larger and take longer to convert from cartilage to bone. These plates convert after the other parts of the bones, and are crucial to development.|$|E
50|$|The postpineal <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> {{broader than}} longer. The premedian <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> thickens {{as you move}} {{posterior}}. The posterior wall of the premedian plate concaves to form the anterior wall of the orbito-nasal cavity and shows prerostral process. The pineal <b>plate</b> <b>is</b> small, trapezoidal, thin bone that covers the most posterior part of the orbito-nasal cavity. It has a rough ornamented surface and a smooth visceral surface that has a round pineal pit. Also, rough postero-ventro-laterally facing processes in the antero-lateral projections of the <b>plate</b> <b>are</b> present.|$|R
30|$|Two hundred microlitres of YPD medium {{was placed}} in each well of the microtiter plate (96 wells) under sterile conditions. Each well was inoculated with a single His+ {{transformant}} using a sterile toothpick and stirred to resuspend the cells. The microtiter <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> covered with sterile aluminum foil and incubated at 30 °C for 2  days. Later, sterile microtiter <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> used and added with 190  μl of YPD medium in each well, and inoculated with 10  μl of the culture from {{the first set of}} microtiter plates. Second set of <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> marked and oriented {{to keep track of the}} wells. The <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> covered and incubated at 30 °C for overnight. Next day, a third set of microtiter <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> sub-cultured as described above. Again the <b>plates</b> <b>were</b> incubated at 30 °C for overnight. From the third set of plates, 10  μl of culture from each well was spotted on YPD plates containing 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0  mg/ml of G 418. <b>Plates</b> <b>were</b> marked properly to track all the clones at different concentrations of G 418. <b>Plates</b> <b>were</b> incubated at 29 °C, and checked after 2 nd, 3 rd, 4 th and 5 th day for G 418 resistant clones.|$|R

It is observed that forces are generated in transverse directions which is special feature of these type of fluids...|$|R
5|$|The {{determination}} of an individual's age by anthropologists {{depends on whether}} or not the individual was an adult or a child. The {{determination of}} the age of children, under the age of 21, is usually performed by examining the teeth. When teeth are not available, children can be aged based on which growth <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> sealed. The tibia plate seals around age 16 or 17 in girls and around 18 or 19 in boys. The clavicle is the last bone to complete growth and the plate is sealed around age 25. In addition, if a complete skeleton is available anthropologists can count the number of bones. While adults have 206 bones, the bones of a child have not yet fused resulting in a much higher number.|$|E
5|$|The {{engravings}} are mirror {{images of}} the paintings (since the engraved <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> copied from the paintings the image is reversed when printed), which leads to problems ascertaining the times shown on the clocks {{in some of the}} scenes. The images are sometimes seen as parodies of middle class life in London at the time, but the moral judgements are not as harsh as in some of Hogarth's other works and the lower classes do not escape ridicule either. Often the theme is one of over-orderliness versus chaos. The four plates depict four times of day, but they also move through the seasons: Morning is set in winter, Noon in spring, and Evening in summer. However, Night—sometimes misidentified as being in September—takes place on Oak Apple Day in May rather than in the autumn.|$|E
5|$|The {{gymnasium}} has {{a capacity}} of approximately 16,000 and the smaller building can accommodate up 5,300 depending on the events that are taking place. At {{the time it was}} built, the gymnasium had the world's largest suspended roof span. Two reinforced concrete pillars support a pre-stressed steel net onto which steel <b>plates</b> <b>are</b> attached. The bottom anchoring of this steel net is a heavy concrete support system which forms a distinct curve on the interior and exterior of the building. In the interior, this structural anchor is used to support the grandstand seats. The overall curvature of the roof helps protect the building from the damaging effects of strong winds.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, the Bullough <b>Plate</b> <b>was</b> {{created for}} first round losers {{to compete for}} and this was won by Glenorchy. The Bullough <b>Plate</b> <b>was</b> {{discontinued}} in 2015.|$|R
