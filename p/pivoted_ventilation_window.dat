40|$|Various {{aerodynamic}} design {{elements and}} technics (wind deflectors, wind walls, etc.) are utilized {{for improvement of}} the thermal efficiency of the natural draft cooling towers, particularly in conditions of cross wind. One of the technical methods, proposed by engineers of Belarus Academy of Sciences, is installation of the <b>ventilation</b> <b>window</b> {{in the center of}} the fill. This method is substantiated by the fact that the flow of cooling gas obtains maximum temperature and humidity near the center of the under-fill space of cooling tower and, as a consequence, performs minimal heat exchange. The influence of the fill <b>ventilation</b> <b>window</b> and wind deflectors in the inlet windows of the cooling tower on its thermal performance in condition of cross-wind is investigated in the paper numerically. The cooling tower of the “Woo-Jin” power plant (China) 150 m of the height and 114 m of the base diameter was taken as a prototype. The analogy (equivalence) between the heat and mass transfer was taken into consideration, which enabled us to consider single-phase flow and perform complicated 3 D simulation by using modern personal computers. Heat transfer coefficient for the fill and its hydrodynamic resistance were defined by using actual data on total flow rate in the cooling tower. The numerical model and computational methods were tested and verified in numerous previous works. The non-linear dependence of the thermal performance of the cooling tower on wind velocity (with the minimum in vicinity of  Ucr  ~ 8 m/s for the simulated system) was demonstrated. Calculations show that in the condition of the average wind speed the fill <b>ventilation</b> <b>window</b> doesn’t improve, but slightly decrease (by 3 – 7 %) performance of the cooling tower. Situation changes in the condition of strong winds  Ucw  > 12 m/s, which are not typical for Belarus. Utilization of airflow deflectors at the inlet windows of cooling tower, conversely, increases thermal performance of the cooling tower on 10 – 12 % for the wide range of winds exceeding 2 m/s. Results of the investigation may be helpful for optimal design of natural draft and perspective “hybrid” cooling towers. </p...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to propose}} and explore natural ventilation schemes {{for the design}} of high-performance, non-residential buildings in hot and humid climates. Three such schemes were applied toward retrofitting the existing Hawai‘i Institute of Geophysics buildings on University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa (UHM) campus in Honolulu. The results were investigated by using parametric study and Airflow Network (AN) model, coupled with thermal model in EnergyPlus. Meanwhile, the number of discomfort hours, during the time the buildings are occupied and based on the adaptive thermal comfort, was used as a quantitative index for the performance of the natural ventilation design schemes. The results revealed that pure cross-ventilation is not a feasible mode to deliver adequate thermal comfort to the occupants, per an acceptable number of discomfort hours. However, with the supplementation of vertical ventilation ducts (shafts), the performance of natural ventilation design schemes significantly improved. In these cases, it was found that either ventilation ducts or <b>ventilation</b> <b>windows</b> can be completely closed, thus eliminating the need of one or the other in natural ventilation designs and therefore mitigating the potential for outdoor noise traveling into spaces through ventilation ducts and/or ventilation windows’ openings.

40|$|The {{supply of}} {{additional}} CO 2 in a greenhouse will be restricted in the future. The concentration in outside air has risen above 400 ppm. This may {{open the possibility}} to blow this air through the canopy to increase growth. In this project, the vertical CO 2 concentration was measured in a vertical plane within to the canopy under different combinations of window opening, the activation of vertical fans and with or without dosing of additional CO 2. For a Freesia and a tomato crop {{the result was that}} without CO 2 dosing it was possible to maintain a concentration of over 350 ppm in the canopy at 5 - 10 cm distance from the leaf surface when the <b>ventilation</b> <b>windows</b> were open. Since, this is below outside concentration, additional supply of outside air may be an advantage. When extra CO 2 was supplied, a reduction in window opening and the use of a screen increased the concentration between the canopy. The vertical distribution of CO 2 within the canopy was never a problem. It can be concluded that the crop resistance to take up CO 2 for a tomato and freesia crop is small and with respect to the other CO 2 resistances, the crop resistance can be neglected. A positive effect of the use of vertical fans or the use of high pressure misting in the tomato greenhouse was not found, due to the strategy to keep the <b>ventilation</b> <b>windows</b> wide open. The concentration at 5 - 10 cm distance from the leaf is not necessarily the same concentration around the stomata because of boundary layer resistance.
