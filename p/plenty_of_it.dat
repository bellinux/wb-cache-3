500|$|... "Homer Defined" [...] has {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, described it as an excellent episode that added new depth to the show in the scene with Marge trying to convince Luann to let Milhouse play with Bart again. They added that Lisa's [...] "faith in her heroic father makes a nice change", {{and said that the}} episode's ending, in which Homer enters the dictionary, [...] "is most satisfying." [...] Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide commented that after the episode [...] "Bart the Murderer", this episode marks a regression, saying it was almost inevitable that it would not match up to the previous episode. He {{went on to say that}} the subplot with Bart and Milhouse was more entertaining. Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave the episode a 4/5 rating, writing that he enjoyed the Homer story but found the Bart and Milhouse subplot more interesting. He added that [...] "Milhouse's mom won't allow him to play with Bart because she thinks Bart is a bad influence. It's rare for the show to allow Bart to feel genuine emotion, but there is <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> in this episode that makes for a nice character oriented story." ...|$|E

[...] At 2307, Hatsutaka {{opened fire on}} Baya with [...] "20mm, 40mm, and 2 or 3 4.7 inch guns at range of 1100 yards." [...] and noted at 2308 that [...] "Jap gunnery poor but <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Tracers passing down {{both sides of the}} periscope shears and overhead. 4.7 inch appeared to be both common and fused, as it was ricochetting alongside and over the stern as well as bursting overhead which was thought at first to be starshells." [...] At 2309, Baya fired another three torpedoes, with Hatsutaka combing the tracks. When Hatsutaka turned on the searchlight at 2320, Baya submerged and fired another torpedo at her, missing again. At 2325, when Baya surfaced, she secured the searchlight and again commenced firing on Baya and dropped six depth charges at 2329, shaking Baya violently. [...] At 2333, the range opened and Baya informed Lagarto that she had been driven off by the escort's gunfire. Baya noted that [...] "It is nothing short of a miracle that we came through so much gunfire without a single hit. [...] His deflection was as consistently on as his range was off." ...|$|E
