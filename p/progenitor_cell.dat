5|$|Tbr1, {{along with}} Pax6 and Tbr2, {{has a role}} in glutamatergic {{projection}} neuron differentiation. Glutamatergic neurons make and release in an activity-dependent manner the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate {{as opposed to the}} inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. The transition from radial glial cells to postmitotic projection neurons occurs in three steps, each associated with one of the aforementioned transcription factors. The first starts out with the expression of Pax6 in radial glial cells found primarily at the ventricular surface. In the next step, Pax6 is downregulated and Tbr2 is expressed as the cell differentiates into an intermediate <b>progenitor</b> <b>cell.</b> Likewise, in the final step, Tbr2 is extremely downregulated to undetectable levels as Tbr1 signals the transition into a postmitotic projection neuron.|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} supports {{the role of}} stem and <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> in vascular regeneration or injury. Following tissue ischemia, <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> are mobilized from their bone marrow or peripheral niches into circulation, adhere at sites of vascular lesion and differentiate {{into a variety of}} mature cell types according to their origin and the local environment. Impairment in this pathophysiological process due to either low numbers of circulating <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> or dysfunctional <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> leads to inadequate vascular repair and upon co-existence with different cardiovascular risk factors to vascular injury and atherosclerosis. Vascular repair is a complex process which includes mobilization, chemotaxis, adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells.</b> The common cardiovascular risk factors can impair this process resulting into inhibition of vascular healing and enhancement of inflammatory pathways which ultimately leads to atherosclerosis. Although homing of <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> into bone marrow has been extensively studied, domiciliation of precursor cells into peripheral tissues and differentiation into mature cells are poorly understood so far. Recently, the role of platelets in domiciliation and subsequent differentiation of <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> has been highlighted.

Over 75% of the AHPCs aligned within 20° of the grooves compared to random growth on the non-patterned substrates. When AHPCs were grown on micropatterned substrates with astrocytes, outgrowth was influenced by the astrocytes that had aligned with the grooves; namely, the AHPCs extended processes along the astrocytic cytoskeletal filaments. However, the alignment was not as significant as that seen by the AHPCs in culture alone with the micropatterned substrate. In order to assess the different phenotypes expressed as a result of differentiation, the cells were stained with antibodies for class III β-tubulin (TuJI), receptor interacting protein (RIP), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which are markers for early neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes, respectively. The greatest amount of differentiation was seen with AHPCs cultured on patterned substrates with astrocytes.|$|E

25|$|Programmed {{cell death}} {{can be reduced}} or {{eliminated}} in the developing nervous system by the targeted deletion of pro-apoptotic genes or by the overexpression of anti-apoptotic genes. The absence or reduction of PCD can cause serious anatomical malformations but can also result in minimal consequences depending on the gene targeted, neuronal population, and stage of development. Excess <b>progenitor</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation that leads to gross brain abnormalities is often lethal, as seen in caspase-3 or caspase-9 knockout mice which develop exencephaly in the forebrain. The brainstem, spinal cord, and peripheral ganglia of these mice develop normally, however, suggesting that the involvement of caspases in PCD during development depends on the brain region and cell type. Knockout or inhibition of apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (APAF1), also results in malformations and increased embryonic lethality. Manipulation of apoptosis regulator proteins Bcl-2 and Bax (overexpression of Bcl-2 or deletion of Bax) produces {{an increase in the}} number of neurons in certain regions of the nervous system such as the retina, trigeminal nucleus, cerebellum, and spinal cord. However, PCD of neurons due to Bax deletion or Bcl-2 overexpression does not result in prominent morphological or behavioral abnormalities in mice. For example, mice overexpressing Bcl-2 have generally normal motor skills and vision and only show impairment in complex behaviors such as learning and anxiety. The normal behavioral phenotypes of these mice suggest that an adaptive mechanism may be involved to compensate for the excess neurons.|$|E

2500|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} aspect of the progressive induction of genes and cell fates in the ventral neural tube {{is illustrated by the}} expression domains of two of the most well characterized transcription factors, [...] Olig2 and Nkx2.2. Early in development the cells at the ventral midline have only been exposed to a low concentration of SHH for a relatively short time, and express the transcription factor Olig2. The expression of Olig2 rapidly expands in a dorsal direction concomitantly with the continuous dorsal extension of the SHH gradient over time. However, as the morphogenetic front of SHH ligand moves and begins to grow more concentrated, cells that are exposed to higher levels of the ligand respond by switching off Olig2 and turning on Nkx2.2., [...] creating a sharp boundary between the cells expressing the transcription factor Nkx2.2 ventral to the cells expressing Olig2. It is in this way that each of the domains of the six <b>progenitor</b> <b>cell</b> populations are thought to be successively patterned throughout the neural tube by the SHH concentration gradient. Mutual inhibition between pairs of transcription factors expressed in neighboring domains contributes to the development of sharp boundaries, however, in some cases, inhibitory relationship has been found even between pairs of transcription factors from more distant domains. Particularly, NKX2-2 expressed in the V3 domain is reported to inhibit IRX3 expressed in V2 and more dorsal domains, although V3 and V2 are separated by a further domain termed MN.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{size and}} cell number of each brain region are {{influenced}} by the organization and behavior of neural <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> during embryonic development. Recent studies on developing neocortex have revealed the presence of neural <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> that divide away from the ventricular surface and undergo symmetric divisions to generate either two neurons or two <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells.</b> These 'basal' <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> form the subventricular zone and are responsible for generating the majority of neocortical neurons. However, not much has been studied on similar types of <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> in other brain regions. Results We have identified and characterized basal <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> in the embryonic mouse thalamus. The progenitor domain that generates all of the cortex-projecting thalamic nuclei contained a remarkably high proportion of basally dividing <b>cells.</b> Fewer basal <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> were found in other progenitor domains that generate non-cortex projecting nuclei. By using intracellular domain of Notch 1 (NICD) as a marker for radial glial cells, we found that basally dividing cells extended outside the lateral limit of radial glial cells, indicating that, similar to the neocortex and ventral telencephalon, the thalamus has a distinct subventricular zone. Neocortical and thalamic basal <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> shared expression of some molecular markers, including Insm 1, Neurog 1, Neurog 2 and NeuroD 1. Additionally, basal <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> in each region also expressed exclusive markers, such as Tbr 2 in the neocortex and Olig 2 and Olig 3 in the thalamus. In Neurog 1 / Neurog 2 double mutant mice, the number of basally dividing <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> in the thalamus was significantly reduced, which demonstrates the roles of neurogenins in the generation and/or maintenance of basal <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells.</b> In Pax 6 mutant mice, the part of the thalamus that showed reduced Neurog 1 / 2 expression also had reduced basal mitosis. Conclusions Our current study establishes the existence of a unique and significant population of basal <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> in the thalamus and their dependence on neurogenins and Pax 6. These <b>progenitor</b> <b>cells</b> may have important roles in enhancing the generation of neurons within the thalamus and may also be critical for generating neuronal diversity in this complex brain region. </p...|$|R
