40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{tenet of}} sexual conflict {{theory is that}} one sex may increase its reproductive success (RS) even if this harms the other sex. Several studies supported this principle by showing that males benefit from reduced paternal care whereas females suffer from it. By investigating <b>penduline</b> <b>tits</b> Remiz pendulinus in nature, we show that parental conflict may be symmetric between sexes. In this small passerine a single female (or male) cares for the offspring, whereas about 30 % of clutches are deserted by both parents. Deserting parents enhance their RS by obtaining multiple mates, and they reduce the RS of their mates due to increased nest failure. Unlike most other species, however, the antagonistic interests are symmetric in <b>penduline</b> <b>tits,</b> because both sexes enhance their own RS by deserting, whilst harming the RS of their mates. We argue that the strong antagonistic interests of sexes explain the high frequency of biparental desertion. ...|$|R

40|$|Engagement in extra-pair copulations is {{an example}} of the {{abundant}} conflicting interests between males and females over reproduction. Potential benefits for females and the risk of cuckoldry for males are expected to have important implications on the evolution of parental care. However, whether parents adjust parental care in response to parentage remains unclear. In Eurasian <b>penduline</b> <b>tits</b> Remiz pendulinus, which are small polygamous songbirds, parental care is carried out either by the male or by the female. In addition, one third of clutches is deserted by both male and female. Desertion takes place during the egg-laying phase. Using genotypes of nine microsatellite loci of 443 offspring and 211 adults, we test whether extra-pair paternity predicts parental care. We expect males to be more likely to desert cuckolded broods, whereas we expect females, if they obtain benefits from having multiple sires, to be more likely to care for broods with multiple paternity. Our results suggest that parental care is not adjusted to parentage on an ecological timescale. Furthermore, we found that male attractiveness does not predict cuckoldry, and we found no evidence for indirect benefits for females (i. e., increased growth rates or heterozygosity of extra-pair offspring). We argue that male Eurasian <b>penduline</b> <b>tits</b> may not be able to assess the risk of cuckoldry; thus, a direct association with parental care is unlikely to evolve. However, timing of desertion (i. e., when to desert during the egg-laying phase) may be influenced by the risk of cuckoldry. Future work applying extensive gene sequencing and quantitative genetics is likely to further our understanding of how selection may influence the association between parentage and parental care. ...|$|R
40|$|Diverse {{patterns}} of parental care, including uniparental care {{by either the}} male or the female, provide excellent opportunities to investigate how variation in social traits is maintained in wild populations. Coexistence of different parental strategies within the same population is expected when they exhibit similar cost-benefit ratios. We investigated {{one of the most}} diverse avian breeding systems and compared parental behavior and reproductive output between nests that are uniparentally cared for by male or female Eurasian <b>Penduline</b> <b>Tits</b> (Remiz pendulinus). In this small passerine bird, full care (incubation and brood care) is provided by the male only (7 - 18 % of nests) or the female only (48 - 65 % of nests). Additionally, a third of all nests are deserted by both parents as a result of intense sexual conflict over care. We show that parental effort is similar between male and female parents, and they achieve similar offspring survival after controlling for clutch-size differences. Females care for larger clutches than males (5. 7 +/- 0. 1 [SE] and 3. 5 +/- 0. 2 eggs, respectively), and they produce more nestlings (3. 6 +/- 0. 2 and 2. 4 +/- 0. 3 nestlings, respectively), although this difference is not significant at fledging of the chicks (3. 1 +/- 0. 2 and 2. 4 +/- 0. 3 young, respectively). Therefore, sex difference in care does not explain the bias toward female-only care in Eurasian <b>Penduline</b> <b>Tits.</b> We propose that the differential benefits of desertion and/or the differential costs of care for males and females facilitate the existence of both uniparental care types in the population.

50|$|In <b>penduline</b> <b>tits</b> (Remiz pendulinus), uniparental care is dominant, {{and either}} sex {{is capable of}} {{desertion}} during the egg laying period. Typically, females care 50-70% of the time, males care 5-20% of the time, and both parents desert 30-40% of the time, condemning the offspring to death. In this system, males build elaborate nests and usually desert once these nests have been filled with the females' eggs. As a result, in response, females have adopted two counter-adaptive behaviors that function to deceive the male regarding the clutch's progress. Females conceal their eggs by burying them and aggressively attack males who approach the nest during the egg laying period. Indeed, studies have shown a high correlation between length of time a male stays before deserting and number of days a female keeps her eggs buried. This relationship suggests that egg burial has evolved as an adaptive female behavior that attempts to control information males use {{to decide whether or}} not they should desert.|$|R
40|$|<b>Penduline</b> <b>tits</b> (Remiz spp.) are {{renowned for}} their diverse mating and {{parenting}} strategies, {{and are a}} well-studied system by behavioural ecologists. However, the phylogenetic relationships and species delimitations within this genus are poorly understood. Here, we investigate phylogenetic relationships within the genus Remiz by examining the genetic variation in the mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene of 64 individuals and in ten autosomal microsatellite markers from 44 individuals. The taxon sampling includes individuals from all currently recognized species (R. pendulinus, R. macronyx, R. coronatus, and R. consobrinus) and most subspecies in the Palearctic region. We showed that R. coronatus and R. consobrinus are genetically well differentiated and constitute independent evolutionary lineages, separated {{from each other and}} from R. pendulinus/macronyx. However, we found no evidence for significant differentiation among R. pendulinus/macronyx individuals in mtDNA haplotypes and only marginal differences between R. pendulinus and R. macronyx in microsatellite markers. Hence, based on present data our recommendation is to treat R. pendulinus and R. macronyx as conspecific and R. coronatus and R. consobrinus as separate species...|$|R
40|$|Eurasian <b>penduline</b> <b>tits</b> (Remiz pendulinus) have {{an unusually}} diverse {{breeding}} system consisting of frequent {{male and female}} polygamy, and uniparental care by the male or the female. Intriguingly, 30 to 40 per cent of all nests are deserted by both parents. To understand the evolution of this diverse breeding system and frequent clutch desertion, we use 6 years of field data to derive fitness expectations {{for males and females}} depending on whether or not they care for their offspring. The resulting payoff matrix corresponds to an asymmetric Snowdrift Game with two alternative evolutionarily stable strategies (ESSs) : female-only and male-only care. This, however, does not explain the polymorphism in care strategies and frequent biparental desertion, because theory predicts that one of the two ESSs should have spread to fixation. Using a bootstrapping approach, we demonstrate that taking account of individual variation in payoffs explains the patterns of care better than a model based on the average population payoff matrix. In particular, a model incorporating differences in male attractiveness closely predicts the observed frequencies of male and female desertion. Our work highlights the need {{for a new generation of}} individual-based evolutionary game-theoretic models. ...|$|R
