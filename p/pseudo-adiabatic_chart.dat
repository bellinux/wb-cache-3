40|$|Abstract: Mean annual surface {{temperatures}} were determined using a ten year surface maximum and minimum temperatures for twenty eight locations in Nigeria. The results were {{then used to}} read off the values of wet-bulb potential temperature, equivalent potential temperature and mixing ratio by following <b>pseudo-adiabatic</b> <b>chart</b> from condensation level, 500 mb to 1000 mb level. Two of the aforementioned read off parameters: wet-bulb potential temperature and equivalent potential temperature were then used to estimate precipitable water values respectively while one of the parameters, mixing ratio was used to calculate for precipitable water. With reference to calculated precipitable water, the impact of wet-bulb potential temperature and equivalent potential temperature on precipitable water was compared. The comparison shows that wet-bulb potential temperature gives excellent impact on precipitable water than equivalent potential temperature in many locations...|$|E
