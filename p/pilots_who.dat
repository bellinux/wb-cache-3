5|$|Geißhardt, then a Hauptmann (Captain), {{arrived at}} Wevelgem on 11 January 1943 {{to take over}} command as Gruppenkommandeur (group commander) of the III. Gruppe (3rd group) of Jagdgeschwader 26 (JG26—26th Fighter Wing) from Major Josef Priller. Geißhardt's arrogance grated {{on some of the}} <b>pilots,</b> <b>who</b> felt that he treated his fellow <b>pilots</b> <b>who</b> had not yet earned the Knight's Cross with too much disdain.|$|E

5|$|After {{more than}} ten years as a first lieutenant, Ramey was finally {{promoted}} to captain on 1 March 1932. On 26 March 1934, Ramey was one of 35 American World War I military <b>pilots</b> <b>who</b> founded the Order of the Daedalians, a fraternal order of military pilots.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to its pilot training responsibilities, No.79 Squadron's Operations Flight provides aircraft to support Navy and Army training exercises. These duties are undertaken by experienced <b>pilots</b> <b>who</b> did not successfully complete operational conversion training, and also by new <b>pilots</b> <b>who</b> have completed training with No.76 Squadron and been posted back to No.79 Squadron until a place becomes available in an operational conversion course. No.76 Squadron has a similar Operations Flight. Most of No. 79 Squadron's exercises with the Navy take place {{off the coast of}} Western Australia, but aircraft are occasionally deployed to Darwin for this task.|$|E

5|$|After the crash, both Crossair and CCP, {{including}} the <b>pilots</b> <b>who</b> had previously {{spoken to the}} media and been fired, publicly stated that the coincidence between the accident and the dispute was very unfortunate and that reports about pilot error being involved in the crash were speculation, although this conclusion was later established to be the probable cause of the accident.|$|E
5|$|Bolt is one {{of seven}} U.S. <b>pilots</b> <b>who</b> {{achieved}} ace status as both a piston-engined pilot in World War II and as a jet pilot in Korea. The others are all USAF pilots: Francis S. Gabreski, James P. Hagerstrom, William T. Whisner, Vermont Garrison and Harrison Thyng, as well as George A. Davis, Jr.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{lighting}} {{was provided}} to illuminate the new road, but for {{one year after the}} opening the lights were kept switched off following objections from river <b>pilots</b> <b>who</b> argued that they would make it hard to distinguish the navigation lights of shipping and the signal lights on the shore. Eventually the electric lights were turned on at a reduced brilliance.|$|E

5|$|In {{its current}} role No.79 Squadron's main {{responsibility}} is to provide introductory fast jet training to <b>pilots</b> <b>who</b> have recently graduated from No.2 Flying Training School. During this training, new <b>pilots</b> <b>who</b> have been selected to fly jet aircraft are taught to operate Hawks and provided with initial instruction on jet aircraft combat tactics. In 2004, each of No.79 Squadron's training courses lasted for twelve weeks. After completing their initial jet aircraft training, pilots transfer to No.76 Squadron at RAAF Base Williamtown for advanced instruction before being posted {{to one of the}} RAAF's operational conversion units. No.79 Squadron also provides introductory training on fast jets for RAAF air combat officers who have been selected to serve on board F/A-18F Super Hornets. The squadron trained RAAF personnel selected to serve as navigators on board F-111 strike aircraft until these aircraft were replaced with Super Hornets in 2010. No.79 Squadron also provides refresher training on the Hawk aircraft for experienced fighter pilots.|$|E
5|$|Loring {{was one of}} four U.S Air Force Medal of Honor {{recipients}} of the Korean War. All four were <b>pilots</b> <b>who</b> were killed in action.

5|$|The {{squadron}} departed Port Moresby {{to return}} to Australia on 7May 1942. It was first located at Townsville and later moved to Kingaroy followed by Lowood to be re-equipped. During this period it also received a number of <b>pilots</b> <b>who</b> had served in Supermarine Spitfire-equipped squadrons in Europe. In late July the unit departed Queensland and returned to New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|Aerobatic {{competitions}} {{take place}} for both powered aircraft and gliders, {{with up to}} 30 events {{each year in the}} UK and Ireland. Starting at the Beginner level, pilots can move up to Standard (powered aircraft) or Sports (glider) levels, and then on to Intermediate, Advanced, and finally Unlimited classes. Each step up requires a wider repertoire of aerobatic figures and progressively more performance from the aircraft. National championships are awarded annually at Standard/Sports, Intermediate, Advanced (powered aircraft only), and Unlimited levels, and <b>pilots</b> <b>who</b> have reached Advanced and Unlimited levels are eligible for selection to represent the UK in international competition.|$|E
5|$|After {{problems}} with the first two airborne operations in Sicily, the Royal Air Force advisor assigned to the 1st Airborne Division suggested that the American C-47 pilots adopt the Royal Air Force bomber stream formation. This entailed the aircraft flying in pairs one behind the other with one minute between each aircraft, instead of flying in their normal 'V' formation. The suggestion was dismissed by the American <b>pilots,</b> <b>who</b> were mostly pre-war airline pilots, not least because their training had not included any instruction in night time navigation and the inexperienced crews relied heavily on following the aircraft in front.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, Connecticut Wing {{was heavily}} {{involved}} in coastal patrol and anti-submarine missions along its section of the Atlantic coast. For this, it received two air medals from the U.S. government. Connecticut Wing also flew recovery operations to rescue American <b>pilots</b> <b>who</b> had lost their aircraft domestically. One of the Sikorsky S-39 Flying Boats used for recovery operations is now {{on display at the}} New England Air Museumat Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|Larger boats {{entering}} Padstow {{were offered}} assistance, generally by <b>pilots</b> <b>who</b> would wait at Stepper Point when a ship signalled {{it would be}} entering. If a boat was foundering, salvors would step in and help. There were cases where salvors attempted to overstate the danger in court, so as to extort more money from the owners. This happened to the brig The Towan, which foundered in October 1843 but was not in significant danger. Although it did not need assistance, salvors interfered and attempted to claim a large amount in compensation from the owner.|$|E
5|$|Many American <b>pilots</b> <b>who</b> {{took part}} in World War II grew up during the 1930s enthusiastically reading flying pulps such as Flying Aces, and were captivated by the {{adventure}} stories, an experience that no doubt {{played a part in}} their decision to become military aviators themselves. Joseph W. Rutter, a pilot in the Army Air Force in 1944, recalls this vividly in his book Wreaking Havoc: A Year in an A-20, as does First Blue, the biography of Roy Marlin Voris, World War II ace and two-time commander of the Blue Angels.|$|E
