50|$|Solid {{contaminants}} in ink blocks can clog <b>printhead</b> nozzles when using original or compatible inks, and may require costly <b>printhead</b> replacement.

50|$|To combat this drying, {{nearly all}} inkjet {{printers}} include {{a mechanism to}} reapply moisture to the <b>printhead.</b> Typically there is no separate supply of pure ink-free solvent available to do this job, and so instead the ink itself is used to remoisten the <b>printhead.</b> The printer attempts to fire all nozzles at once, and as the ink sprays out, some of it wicks across the <b>printhead</b> to the dry channels and partially softens the hardened ink. After spraying, a rubber wiper blade is swept across the <b>printhead</b> to spread the moisture evenly across the <b>printhead,</b> and the jets are again all fired to dislodge any ink clumps blocking the channels.|$|R

The design of a short stroke movable <b>printhead</b> mechanism with an actuator is discussed,aiming at a positioning accuracy within 10 lm. A dynamic finite element model is developed to determine the eigenfrequencies,mode shapes and transfer functions of the <b>printhead</b> guidance mechanism. The principle is validated in closed loop by various tests with arealized prototype. The experimental results show that static as well as dynamic alignment errors are compensated for within the requirementwhereas the manufacturing tolerances can even be lowered...|$|R
50|$|Most {{low-cost}} consumer printers place small ink tanks {{directly on}} the carriage with the <b>printheads.</b> These tanks can have extremely small liquid volumes, as low as 10 mL, and consequently require frequent replacement. It should be also noted that every cartridge replacement is usually automatically followed by head-cleaning cycle of the printer to remove air bubbles from system, further reducing usable ink amount. More expensive, business-grade printers use progressively larger ink tanks on the printhead, but as the platen width and speed of the printer increases it eventually becomes impractical to have the tanks integrated with the <b>printheads</b> due to the high mass and inertia the liquid volume adds to the <b>printheads</b> and the reduced accuracy of printing that occurs.|$|E

50|$|Many {{consumer}} grade printers {{are designed}} with close-fitting and sometimes fully enclosing shrouds over the print carriage. It may be difficult or impossible to install a retrofit kit {{because there is no}} room to install the flexible tubing that must flex and bend as the <b>printhead</b> moves back and forth. Jamming may occur if the tubing droops into the path of the <b>printhead</b> and is crushed underneath the <b>printhead</b> or between the <b>printhead</b> and cover. It may be necessary to modify the printer by removing the cover or cutting slots into the body to provide an open space for the tubing.|$|R
5000|$|Every {{time the}} printer loses power {{for long enough}} to cause the portion of ink which was being kept above its [...] "freeze point" [...] in the <b>printhead</b> to drop below that temperature, the mass of ink in each {{reservoir}} would have contracted in size enough (as {{a result of the}} cooling) to permit air to enter the <b>printhead,</b> which would result in print aberrations until the <b>printhead</b> reservoirs had been refilled by the ink-melter assembly above it. As a result, the <b>printhead</b> is then purged using a vacuum pump, causing some ink to be flushed from the <b>printhead's</b> holding tanks into the waste tray to remove the air from the <b>printhead.</b> (Xerox printers have a [...] "waste ink" [...] tray for this purpose. Since all four inks are dumped into a unified [...] "waste ink" [...] tray, it is impossible to reuse the lost ink since the four process colors coalesce to form a single solid mass in the tray, which look much like solidified candle wax drippings, but almost black.) If the printer was in its sleep state, less time without power would be required to necessitate a purge cycle than if the printer was in its ready-to-print state (since the <b>printhead</b> is kept much hotter when ready-to-print).|$|R

However, an exhausting manual selective process inevitably wastes a lot of time.

Experimental results show that this method can quickly and accuracy find out the suitable combination of driving waveform parameters {{to meet the needs}} of applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{operation}} of a piezo inkjet <b>printhead</b> involves a chain of processes in many physical domains at different length scales. The final goal is the formation of droplets {{of all kinds of}} fluids with any desired volume, velocity, and a reliability as high as possible. The physics behind the chain of processes comprise the two-way coupling from the electrical to the mechanical domain through the piezoelectric actuator, where an electrical signal is transformed into a mechanical deformation of the <b>printhead</b> structure. The next two steps are the coupling to the acoustic domain inside the ink channels, and the coupling to the fluid dynamic domain, i. e. the drop formation process. The dynamics of the <b>printhead</b> structure are coupled via the acoustics to the drop formation process in the nozzle. Furthermore, wetting of the nozzle plate and air bubbles can have a negative influence on the <b>printhead</b> performance. The five topics (actuation, channel acoustics, drop formation, wetting, and air bubbles) are reviewed in this paper. This research connects the product developments for many emerging new industrial applications of the inkjet technology to the fundamental physical phenomena underlying the <b>printhead</b> operation...|$|R
50|$|The {{primary cause}} of inkjet {{printing}} problems is ink drying on the <b>printhead's</b> nozzles, causing the pigments and dyes to dry out and form a solid block of hardened mass that plugs the microscopic ink passageways. Most printers attempt to prevent this drying from occurring by covering the <b>printhead</b> nozzles with a rubber cap when the printer is not in use. Abrupt power losses, or unplugging the printer before it has capped the <b>printhead,</b> can cause the <b>printhead</b> to be left in an uncapped state. Even when the head is capped, this seal is not perfect, and {{over a period of}} several weeks the moisture (or other solvent) can still seep out, causing the ink to dry and harden. Once ink begins to collect and harden, the drop volume can be affected, drop trajectory can change, or the nozzle can completely fail to jet ink.|$|R

For printers several years old, {{it is common for}} the dried ink in the spittoon to form a pile that can stack up and touch the <b>printheads,</b> jamming the printer.

40|$|A Three Dimensional Printing (3 DP) machine system {{integrating}} a Drop on Demand (DoD) <b>printhead</b> is presented.

To build a three-dimensional part, powder beds are manually spread and powder grains are selectively bound by liquid drops from an inkjet style <b>printhead.</b> Successive layers are added until the part is completed. The machine target use is making small-scale tests with the real working parameters for the development of new material systems and it is specifically designed to print and examine single scanlines. Hardware design includes two axes working space and a PC-based control system. Special software to control the <b>printhead</b> and the main axes in different configurations, to print rings and lines, with continuously changing parameters has been developed, which generates a detailed report for the process monitoring. Methods for the <b>printhead</b> characterization are also described, including a new fast technique to estimate the drop speed.

40|$|In recent years, inkjet {{technology}} {{has emerged as}} a promising manufacturing tool. This technology has gained its popularity mainly due to the facts that it can handle diverse materials and it is a non-contact and additive process. Moreover, the {{inkjet technology}} offers low operational costs, easy scalability, digital control and low material waste. Thus, apart from conventional document printing, the inkjet technology has been successfully applied as a micro-manufacturing tool in the areas of electronics, mechanical engineering, and life sciences. In this thesis, we investigate a piezo-based drop-on-demand (DoD) <b>printhead</b> which is commonly used for industrial and commercial applications due to its ability to handle diverse materials. A typical drop-on-demand (DoD) inkjet <b>printhead</b> consists of several ink channels in parallel. Each ink channel is provided with a piezo-actuator which on the application of an actuation voltage pulse, generates pressure oscillations inside the ink channel. These pressure oscillations push the ink drop out of the nozzle. The print quality delivered by an inkjet <b>printhead</b> depends on the properties of the jetted drop, i. e., the drop velocity, the drop volume and the jetting direction. To meet the challenging performance requirements posed by new applications, these drop properties have to be tightly controlled. The performance of the inkjet <b>printhead</b> is limited by two factors. The first one is the residual pressure oscillations. The actuation pulses are designed to provide an ink drop of a specified volume and velocity under the assumption that the ink channel is in a steady state. Once the ink drop is jetted the pressure oscillations inside the ink channel take several micro-seconds to decay. If the next ink drop is jetted before these residual pressure oscillations have decayed, the resulting drop properties will be different from the ones of the previous drop. The second limiting factor is the cross-talk. The drop properties through an ink channel are affected when the neighboring channels are actuated simultaneously. Generally, the drop consistency is improved by manual tuning of the piezo actuation pulse based on some physical insight or based on exhaustive experimental studies on the <b>printhead.</b> However, these ad-hoc procedures have proved to be insufficient in dealing with the above limitations. In this thesis, a model-based control approach is proposed to improve the performance of a DoD inkjet <b>printhead.</b> It offers a systematic and efficient means to improve the attainable performance of a DoD inkjet <b>printhead</b> by reducing the effect of the residual oscillations and the cross-talk. Furthermore, the models that have been developed for this purpose can also give new insights into the operation of the <b>printhead.</b> In order to achieve this goal, it is required to have a fairly accurate and simple model of an inkjet <b>printhead.</b> It is not easy to obtain a good physical model for an inkjet <b>printhead</b> due to insufficient knowledge of the complex interactions in the <b>printhead.</b> Therefore, in this thesis, we have used system identification, i. e. we use experimental measurements in order to develop a model. For this purpose, it is required that the piezo-actuator is also used as a sensor. Note that the crucial aspect in the model development is to obtain a model of the inkjet system close to its operating conditions. Therefore, we have collected measurements of the piezo sensor signal during the jetting of a series of drops at a given DoD frequency. For the <b>printhead</b> under investigation, we found that the dynamics of the ink channel are dependent on the DoD frequency. This phenomenon is caused by non-linearities in the droplet formation. Consequently, we have modeled the ink channel dynamics for every DoD frequency. In this thesis, it is shown that the set of local inkjet models obtained at different DoD frequencies can be encompassed by a polytopic uncertainty on the parameters of a nominal model. Using the same identification procedure, the cross-talk can also be modeled. In order to improve the <b>printhead</b> performance the actuation pulse was redesigned. The new drive pulse is designed to provide good performance for all models in the area of uncertainty by means of robust feedforward control. The pulse also respects the pulse shape constraints posed by driving electronics (ASICS). Besides the robust actuation pulse, our approach also introduces an optimal delay between actuation of neighboring channels to reduce the cross-talk. The current driving electronics limits the possibilities of reshaping the actuation pulse. Since it is expected that this limitation will be relaxed in the future, we have also developed procedure to design a robust pulse without pulse shape constraints. The performance improvement achieved with this unconstrained pulse has proved to be quite limited. The proposed method is also useful for inkjet practitioners who do not have any insight in the inkjet dynamics. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated by our experimental results. The proposed method was verified in practice by jetting a series of ink drops at various DoD frequencies and also by jetting a bitmap image. For the <b>printhead</b> under consideration, the drop-consistency is improved by almost four times with the proposed approach when compared to the conventional methods.

50|$|If an inkjet head becomes clogged, {{third-party}} ink solvents/head cleaners {{and replacement}} heads {{are available in}} some cases. The cost of such items may be less expensive compared to a transfer unit for a laser printer, but the laser printer unit has a much longer lifetime between required maintenance. Many inkjet printer models now have permanently installed heads, which cannot be economically replaced if they become irreversibly clogged, resulting in scrapping of the entire printer. On the other hand, inkjet printer designs which use a disposable printhead usually cost significantly more per page than printers using permanent heads. By contrast, laser printers do not have <b>printheads</b> to clog or replace frequently, and usually can produce many more pages between maintenance intervals.|$|E

A consequence of this design is that the print quality is not specified in resolution alone, but via a [...] "resolution mode" [...] quality setting (up to 5 quality settings available at a time). The resolution parameter in the driver-output data is only a meta-resolution, typically either 300 or 600 dpi, sometimes 1200 dpi for certain monochrome or high-quality photo modes on a limited number of printers. The firmware then controls the printhead and creates physical ink output up to the marketed resolution.|$|E
