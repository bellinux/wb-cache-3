40|$|ObjectiveThis study {{presents}} {{data from}} a large-scale anthropometric study of U. <b>S.</b> <b>truck</b> drivers and the multivariate anthropometric models developed {{for the design of}} next-generation truck cabs. BackgroundUp-to-date anthropometric information of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>truck</b> driver population is needed for the design of safe and ergonomically efficient truck cabs. MethodWe collected 35 anthropometric dimensions for 1, 950 truck drivers (1, 779 males and 171 females) across the continental United States using a sampling plan designed to capture the appropriate ethnic, gender, and age distributions of the truck driver population. ResultsTruck drivers are heavier than the U. S. general population, with a difference in mean body weight of 13. 5 kg for males and 15. 4 kg for females. They are also different in physique from the U. S. general population. In addition, the current truck drivers are heavier and different in physique compared to their counterparts of 25 to 30 years ago. ConclusionThe data obtained in this study provide more accurate anthropometric information for cab designs than do the current U. S. general population data or truck driver data collected 25 to 30 years ago. Multivariate anthropometric models, spanning 95 % of the current truck driver population {{on the basis of a}} set of 12 anthropometric measurements, have been developed to facilitate future cab designs. ApplicationThe up-to-date truck driver anthropometric data and multivariate anthropometric models will benefit the design of future truck cabs which, in turn, will help promote the safety and health of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>truck</b> drivers.

40|$|Truck driving {{can be a}} {{hazardous}} occupation. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2009 truck drivers experienced 16. 8 % of all transportation-related fatalities and 2. 04 % of the nonfatal injuries requiring days away from work, even though they only made up 1. 0 % of the U. <b>S.</b> workforce. <b>Truck</b> drivers spend long hours behind the wheel, working an average of 41. 5 hours per week. Therefore, a well-designed truck cab can make {{a significant difference in}} the working conditions for a truck driver. Truck cab design impacts comfort, but more importantly impacts the safety of truck drivers and other road users. For example, if the design of the truck cab is poorly fitted to the size and dimensions of the driver, the road may be less visible, driving controls may be more difficult to reach, and seatbelts may be less comfortable and less likely to be used - all of which increase the risk of injury to the driver and other road users. Truck manufacturers consider the body dimensions of truck drivers as they design truck cabs. However, until recently the most current body measurement data for truck drivers dated from the early 1980 s. The composition of the trucker workforce has changed dramatically in the past 30 years, with an increase in the diversity of ethnic groups and the percentage of women working in this profession. As the truck manufacturing industry moves forward to design the next generation of truck cabs, there is a pressing need for up-to-date information on the body dimensions of U. <b>S.</b> <b>truck</b> drivers.

OBJECTIVES: We {{have established a}} large retrospective cohort to assess mortality in the unionized U. <b>S.</b> <b>trucking</b> industry. To provide insight into mortality patterns associated with job-specific exposures, we examined rates of cause-specific mortality compared with the general U. S. population. METHODS: We used records from four national trucking companies to identify 54, 319 male employees employed in 1985. Cause-specific mortality was assessed through 2000 using the National Death Index. Expected numbers of all and cause-specific deaths were calculated stratifying by race, 10 -year age group, and calendar period using U. S. national reference rates. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the entire cohort and by job title. RESULTS: As expected in a working population, we found a deficit in overall and all-cancer mortality, likely due to the healthy worker effect. In contrast, compared with the general U.

40|$|There is a {{widespread}} misconception that the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 thoroughly deregulated the U. <b>S.</b> <b>trucking</b> industry. Actually, the Act only partially reduced the federal regulation of interstate trucking operations. At the state level, the Act left the decision to deregulate intrastate trucking to state regulators who could decide (a) whether there should be any intrastate deregulation, and (b) the institutional arrangements under which such deregulation would take place. While several states subsequently adopted deregulation, most states continue to regulate either the trucking rates charged by intrastate motor carriers, the entry of new carriers, or both. One {{purpose of this paper}} is to identify the factors that influence the regulators' net political returns from regulating the trucking industry and the probability of a state regulating the trucking industry. In addition, we investigate empirically whether such regulation has influenced the rates charged for intrastate trucking services. Our results suggest that variables reflecting the relative strengths of special interest groups explain the fact that some states choose to deregulate intrastate trucking while others do not. Special interest groups exerting influence on regulation of intrastate trucking are: (1) providers of railroad services, (2) providers of sea transportation, (3) regulators, (4) and farmers. This paper yields some empirical evidence showing that as special interest groups gain or lose strength over time and/or across states it affects states' decisions to adopt or unadopt policies. ...|$|R

Following deregulation of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>trucking</b> industry in 1979 - 1980, the real earnings of trucking firm executives (corporate officers) fell {{for a year or}} two, but then stabilized and, in the mid- 1980 s, recovered. Profit rates also fell immediately after deregulation, and then leveled off. The earnings of employee drivers, on the other hand, went into steady decline from 1979 to past the end of the period studied here. To analyze these trends we use a version of the Motor Carrier Financial and Operating Statistics, collected by the Interstate Commerce Commission on all medium-sized and large trucking firms for the years 1977 - 1986. Our version is unique in breaking out annual employee earnings by employee category for this time period. We document the change in the relative earnings of drivers and executives within the same trucking firms over time. We test the predictions of principal-agent theory and the political constraint model concerning the effect of deregulation on the level and performance sensitivity of executive pay, and find evidence favoring political constraint over principal-agent. We also explore the effects of union presence and union busting on the pay of executives, and find that officers in unionized firms get paid more on average, but that officers' pay increases when a unionized firm goes non-union. ...|$|R

Development of a mathematical prediction model to provide the necessary estimates of reach requirements initially necessitates a demonstration of the feasibility of predicting reach from associated anthropometric variables. Measures of arm reach at twenty-six points in space, as well as height, weight, age, arm length, shoulder height and shoulder breadth for a sample of 110 U. <b>S.</b> <b>truck</b> drivers were treated by stepwise multiple regression analysis to develop linear equations which predict reach from values of the other six anthropometric variables. Of the six variables, height was uniformly the best predictor, with age and weight contributing significantly to the variance in reach accounted for.

Wage theft in the form of lengthy and uncompensated wait times is also common. The brief concludes with a consideration of the applicability of model legislation from other states to the particularly acute issues faced by California's short-haul truckers. ...|$|R

40|$|Economic {{analysis}} has said little about how an individual’s cognitive skills (CS's) {{are related to}} the individual’s preferences in different choice domains, such as risk-taking or saving, and how preferences in different domains are related to each other. Using a sample of 1, 000 trainee truckers we report three findings. First, we show a strong and significant relationship between an individual’s cognitive skills and preferences, and between the preferences in different choice domains. The latter relationship may be counterintuitive: a patient individual, more inclined to save, is also more willing to take calculated risks. A second finding is that measures of cognitive skill predict social awareness and choices in a sequential Prisoner's Dilemma game. Subjects with higher CS's more accurately forecast others' behavior, and differentiate their behavior depending on the first mover’s choice, returning higher amount for a higher transfer, and lower for a lower one. After controlling for investment motives, subjects with higher CS’s also cooperate more as first movers. A third finding concerns on-the-job choices. Our subjects incur a significant financial debt for their training that is forgiven only after twelve months of service. Yet over half leave within the first year, and cognitive skills are also strong predictors of who exits too early, stronger than any other social, economic and personality measure in our data. These results suggest that cognitive skills affect the economic lives of individuals, by systematically changing preferences and choices in a way that favors the economic success of individuals with higher cognitive skills. field experiment, risk aversion, ambiguity aversion, loss aversion, time preference, Prisoners Dilemma, social dilemma, IQ, MPQ, numeracy, U. <b>S.</b> <b>trucking</b> industry, for-hire carriage, truckload (TL), driver turnover, employment duration, survival model...|$|R
