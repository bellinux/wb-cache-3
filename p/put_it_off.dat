5|$|Andy (Ed Helms) {{still has}} not learned about fiancee Angela's (Angela Kinsey) affair with Dwight (Rainn Wilson), {{seventeen}} days after Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) revealed it to {{everyone else in the}} Dunder Mifflin office. Michael (Steve Carell) suggests he should inform Andy, but the entire office argues that Angela should be the one to break the news. Jim (John Krasinski) is particularly concerned that Andy's past anger management issues may lead to violence. Dwight tries convincing Angela to tell Andy, but she continues to <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> This leaves Michael to tell Andy before he leaves for a meeting with David Wallace (Andy Buckley). Michael reveals the affair to Andy while driving out of the parking lot, leaving Andy shocked and dismayed. Angela reluctantly confirms the affair occurred, and Andy realizes everybody else in the office already knew about it.|$|E
500|$|Plagued by a hip injury, Bégin {{was again}} left {{a free agent}} prior to the 2011–12 season. He signed a {{professional}} tryout offer with the Vancouver Canucks, but was released by the team during the pre-season. Bob Hartley, coach of ZSC Lions in the Swiss National League A offered him a spot on their team. [...] Though he had already scheduled surgery to repair his hip, Bégin was willing to <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> to play in Switzerland, but was convinced by Hartley to complete the procedure. His recovery prevented Bégin from playing anywhere during the season.|$|E
500|$|The {{day before}} their executions Guildford asked Jane {{for a last}} meeting, which she refused, {{explaining}} it [...] "would only ... increase their misery and pain, {{it was better to}} <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> ... as they would meet shortly elsewhere, and live bound by indissoluble ties." [...] Around ten o'clock in the morning of 12 February Guildford was led towards Tower Hill, where [...] "many ... gentlemen" [...] waited to shake hands with him. Guildford made a short speech to the assembled crowd, as was customary. [...] "Having no ghostly father with him", he knelt, prayed, and asked the people to pray for him, [...] "holding up his eyes and hands to God many times". He was killed with one stroke of the axe, after which his body was conveyed on a cart to the Tower chapel of St Peter ad Vincula. Watching the scene from her window, Jane exclaimed: [...] "Oh, Guildford, Guildford!" [...] He was buried in the chapel with Jane who was dead within the hour.|$|E
60|$|The opera {{that evening}} was 'Carmen,' and {{he chose the}} last entr'acte to break the news, instinctively <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> till the latest moment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Neither would I. Well, now, I {{have got}} {{something}} to tell you--something I ought to have told you long ago--something that Ross ought to know. I intended {{to tell you that}} first day you came back, but I couldn't somehow get to it, and I kept <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> and <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> till--well, then I got fond of you, and every day made it harder." [...] Here she made her supreme effort. [...] "Child, I'm an old bluff. I'm not your mother at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No-now; right away. I've {{been talking}} with Geo'ge about it; and the'e's no sense in <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> I ought to begin {{taking care of him}} at once." ...|$|R
2500|$|Roger Salazar, a California Democratic Party {{spokesman}} {{also was}} quoted as saying - [...] "They want to <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> onto some massive conspiracy theory... The governor's office is trying to play up the nefarious angle to deflect attention from their own incompetence [...] accidentally posting the recording on its own Web site. And from the recordings themselves." ...|$|E
2500|$|Crowe {{stated in}} November 2007 {{that he would}} like to be baptised as a Christian and felt that he had <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> for too long. [...] "I do believe there are more {{important}} things than what is in the mind of a man", he said. [...] "There is something much bigger that drives us all. I'm willing to take that leap of faith." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, Anderson {{made her}} first {{appearance}} in Vincenzo Bellini's Norma at the Lyric Opera of Chicago. [...] The Chicago Tribune noted that Anderson's [...] "clear, bright upper range was at its clarion best, the soprano singing with strength and nuanced sensitivity" [...] and hailed her acting as well: [...] "ramatically, Anderson was exceptional, drawing {{out all of the}} conflicting emotions with an intensity tempered by dignity." [...] Later in 1997, she returned to the Opera Orchestra of New York to portray her first Elvira in Verdi's Ernani. [...] In 1998, Anderson spoke in Opera News of her move away from light coloratura roles [...] "into deeper water":I wanted to <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> as long as possible. I kept saying, and it's been quoted so many times, I didn't want to do [...] "Normina." [...] I wanted to do Norma. And Leonora. I didn't want to sound like a soubrette trying to do these things. I've done things like Il Corsaro and La Battaglia di Legnano very early in my career, so Verdi's always been a presence. I did mostly Rigolettos and Traviatas, and then I added Desdemona a few years ago. ... So I suppose Leonora would be next in line." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, she {{has made}} a dreadful scene; she insists on our <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> again. We're very unhappy: poor Ray has been turned off." [...] Her tears began to flow again.|$|R
5000|$|... "Straightway" [...] has a {{two-fold}} meaning. Character-wise, {{it means}} {{one should be}} honest, frank, and morally upright. It also means straight-away, doing at once {{what should be done}} now and not <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{can be put}} off till to-morrow if there's {{any good}} in <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> off," [...] said Rachel. Mrs. Ray {{seemed to think that}} there might be good in <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>off,</b> or rather that there would be harm in doing it at once.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pray, pray, papa, <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> till our return;--pray <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> {{till you}} have seen the bishop;--dear papa! for my sake, for Eleanor's!--" ...|$|E
6000|$|BRODIE. If you'd take a hint, you'd <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> until to-morrow. But I {{suppose you}} won't. On, then, I'm listening. I'm listening! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if it doesn't rain I won't come. I'll <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> another year, an' cuss them other fellers into holdin' off, too." ...|$|E
60|$|December 1st.--A sad, sad day--a {{day that}} I have no heart to {{describe}} at any length. After weakly <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> last night, I {{was obliged to}} speak to her this morning of Sir Percival's proposal about the wedding tour.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, so it {{is always}} with you ladies; when a man is bent on suthin' closer and more interestin' like, you're for <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> on {{friendship}}. Now friendship is good enough in its way, Madam Budd, but friendship is n't love." ...|$|R
50|$|Over {{the past}} four decades, {{budgeting}} has limited the Forest Service's ability to maintain the lake and its feeder pipeline. Then years of drought reduced the lake’s water levels which continued microbiological contamination of the water, <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> limits to any type of swimming at all.|$|R
6000|$|... 'She looked dubious. [...] "Uncle is so dreadful {{nervous about}} law business," [...] says she, [...] "that, as you know, he's <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> for years; and now to-day really I've feared it would verily drive {{him out of}} his mind. His poor three teeth quite chattered when I said to him that you would be here soon with the {{parchment}} writing. He always was afraid of agents, and folks that come for rent, and such-like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I will <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> until to-morrow,' Ethelberta murmured gloomily; 'I {{have a bad}} headache, and I {{am afraid}} I cannot stay with you after all.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But why go {{into this}} so quick? Why not <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> fifteen or twenty years?" [...] asked Hartley, {{trying to get back}} to cheerful voice.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, he will, when {{he knows}} it was because I wished to spare him, and that I did not expect him home so soon. And you must not let me {{stand in the way}} of your Christmas party. <b>Putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> would only make matters worse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{heard he}} was going to--that's all, going to make another attempt, after <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> once or twice... As far as they {{themselves}} are concerned {{they are the only}} two in the show. I should be ashamed of making myself so silly if I were he!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Get over it! I suppose I shall; but I {{shall never}} be as I was. I've been always {{thinking}} {{of the day when}} there must be a lady at Spoon Hall, and <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>off,</b> you know. There'll never be a lady there now;--never. You don't think there's any chance at all?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{very well}} <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> now; that's true. But I had a qualm {{when she gave}} that little cry at sight of the licence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Humph! he can't <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> {{on anybody}} else like that!" [...] cried Phil. [...] "We know beyond {{a doubt that}} he and Jasniff {{committed}} that crime." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have come}} along at last," [...] he remarked in an ironical tone. [...] "Feel like {{getting down to}} {{business}} or shall we <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I say, papa {{will miss}} the train," [...] replied Magdalen, taking Miss Garth's hint with her {{customary}} quickness. [...] "The last thing he attends to at Grailsea will be the business that brings him there. Whenever he has business to do, he always <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> to the last moment, doesn't he, mamma?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There isn't standing-room anywhere," [...] she declared. [...] "I don't {{suppose there}} ever was a play in London that was more talked about; and then <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> {{for more than three}} months--why, there have been all sorts of rumors about.

6000|$|... "Says he's {{going to}} see Adeline and explain everything--and doesn't do <b>it....</b> <b>Puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> And Adeline, as far as I can gather, says that if he doesn't come down soon, she's hanged if she'll see him, much as her heart may be broken, and all that, if she doesn't. You know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> to {{some future}} day, Dom. But isn't it a pity that such pretty places should be spoiled by such greedy and cruel monsters?" ...|$|E
6000|$|THE ENVOY [reassured] Just so. The election. Now {{what we want}} to know is this: ought we to {{dissolve}} in August, or <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> until next spring? ...|$|E
6000|$|He paused as if {{taken aback}} by her readiness, and replied with much uncertainty, 'Would it--wouldn't it be better to <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> till there is less sun?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I cannot talk of {{such things}} just now,' {{answered}} the father, who could not {{bear the thought of}} giving his favourite daughter to this horrible old man, and hoped, by <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>off,</b> that something might happen. But the sisters, who had always been rather jealous of Helga, were secretly pleased that their bridegrooms should outshine hers.|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{n't believe}} it either! It was Mrs. Maynard that {{proposed}} the sail, but when I saw that you did n't like it I was glad of any excuse for <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> I could n't help wanting to please you, and I couldn't see why you urged us afterwards; but I supposed you had some reason." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Papa, my {{strength}} fades away every day, and I know I must go.
