50|$|The Act {{states that}} an {{employee}} {{does not need}} to supply a <b>medical</b> <b>certificate</b> if the employee is away from work for 3 calendar days or less. This removes any unfairness in requiring an employee to supply a costly <b>medical</b> <b>certificate</b> when taking a short time off work. However, the Act states 3 calendar days, and not work days, so even taking off just 1 day off work, and that is either a Friday or a Monday, technically would require a <b>medical</b> <b>certificate.</b> Furthermore, the Act was later amended that an employer can still request a <b>medical</b> <b>certificate</b> if they have reasonable grounds the employee is not sick, and that the employer agrees to reimburse the employee for the cost of obtaining the <b>medical</b> <b>certificate.</b>|$|R
