A prep screen washes any remaining <0.5 mm material that inadvertently reported to the DMS feed into an effluent tank. The >0.5 mm product reports into two mixing boxes where it is mixed with primary DMS dense medium, before being pumped up to the primary DMS cyclones. There are two identical DMS circuits consisting of 3 Multotec cyclones fed by VSD <b>pump</b> <b>set</b> at 180 kPa and a cut density close to 2.7g/cm^3, so as to separate out the majority of silicates whilst not losing any particles containing heavy minerals. The floats and sinks from these cyclones report to drain/rinse screens where the respective products are separated from the medium. Primary DMS floats go to the tailings storage facility via conveyor and large storage tanks, whilst sinks are sent to the secondary DMS circuit for further refining.|$|E
50|$|Urea-formaldehyde foam {{insulation}} (UFFI) {{dates to the}} 1930s and made a synthetic insulation with R-values near 5.0 per inch. It is a foam, like shaving cream, that is easily injected or pumped into walls. It is made by using a <b>pump</b> <b>set</b> and hose with a mixing gun to mix the foaming agent, resin and compressed air. The fully expanded foam is pumped into areas in need of insulation. It becomes firm within minutes but cures within a week. UFFI is generally found in homes built before the 1970s, often in basements, crawl spaces, attics, and unfinished attics. Visually it looks like oozing liquid that has been hardened. Over time, it tends to vary in shades of butterscotch but new UFFI is a light yellow color. Early forms of UFFI tended to shrink significantly. Modern UF insulation with updated catalysts and foaming technology have reduced shrinkage to minimal levels (between 2-4%). The foam dries with a dull matte color with no shine. When cured, it often has a dry and crumbly texture.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: At present, the <b>pump</b> <b>setting</b> {{depth of}} machine wells in Tahe Oilfield is universally too deep as the {{reservoir}} is buried deep, viscosity of heavy oil is high, and the producing energy weakened. This {{will increase the}} input of sucker rod, oil tube material and lead to enlarge suspension point load of pumping unit mule head and energy consumption. According to the problems, {{on the basis of}} the regularity of distribution of wellbore pressure field, viscosity field, temperature field, this paper puts forward a new matching lifting technology: moving down the point of blending and picking up the <b>pump</b> <b>setting</b> depth. Moving down the point of blending can reduce the producing energy loss and enforce the crude oil’s fluidity in the wellbore,and picking up the pump depth can reduce the cost and energy consumption, Field test shows that after the new type matching lifting technology implement, test wells are normal in operation. The <b>pump</b> <b>setting</b> depth is partly picked up and pumping unit load decreases. The single well saves thin oil by more than 10 %. ...|$|R
