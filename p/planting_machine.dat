Hall's (1970) {{report on}} the state of site {{preparation}} in Ontario noted that blades and rakes were found to be well suited to post-cut scarification in tolerant hardwood stands for natural regeneration of yellow birch. Plows were most effective for treating dense brush prior to planting, often in conjunction with a <b>planting</b> <b>machine.</b> Scarifying teeth, e.g., Young's teeth, were sometimes used to prepare sites for planting, but their most effective use was found to be preparing sites for seeding, particularly in backlog areas carrying light brush and dense herbaceous growth. Rolling choppers found application in treating heavy brush but could be used only on stone-free soils. Finned drums were commonly used on jack pine-spruce cutovers on fresh brushy sites with a deep duff layer and heavy slash, and they needed to be teamed with a tractor pad unit to secure good distribution of the slash. The S.F.I. scarifier, after strengthening, had been [...] "quite successful" [...] for 2 years, promising trials were under way with the cone scarifier and barrel ring scarifier, and development had begun on a new flail scarifier for use on sites with shallow, rocky soils. Recognition of the need to become more effective and efficient in site preparation led the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests to adopt the policy of seeking and obtaining for field testing new equipment from Scandinavia and elsewhere that seemed to hold promise for Ontario conditions, primarily in the north.

To determine if excavators with two crane arms could potentially help to increase <b>planting</b> <b>machine</b> productivity under Nordic clearcut conditions, we modelled one- armed and semi-automated two-armed excavators with one- and two-headed planting devices. Using a recently developed tool for discrete-event simulation, these machine models then mounded and planted seedlings on terrain models with moraine soil having various frequencies of obstacles (stumps, roots and stones). Compared to if the two heads were mounted pairwise on only one arm, the results showed that productivity did not increase if two planting heads were attached individually to two separate crane arms. But productivity did increase if the <b>planting</b> <b>machine</b> had four planting heads mounted pairwise on two separate arms. However, despite assuming automated mounding and crane motion between planting spots, the two-armed, four- headed model never achieved high enough productivity levels to make it more cost-efficient than one-armed machines. The simulations illustrate that our terrain models generate realistic root architecture and boulder content distributions in moraine soil, while our machine models functionally describe mechanized planting work. Based on our assumptions, we conclude that further development work on two-armed excavator-based planting machines for Nordic clearcut conditions is not warranted. Our simulations reveal that increasing the number of planting heads per crane arm rather than number of crane arms per base machine offers the greatest potential to raise the productivity of intermittently advancing planting machines...|$|E

40|$|When reforesting clearcuts in {{southern}} Sweden, the Bracke Planter has shown to plant seedlings with better planting quality than operational manual tree planting (Ersson and Petersson 2011). Consequently, {{there is an}} increasing demand for intermittently advancing tree planting machines with crane-mounted planting devices {{in southern}} Sweden. Nevertheless, regardless of using one- (Bracke Planter) or two-headed planting devices (M-Planter), today’s average <b>planting</b> <b>machine</b> productivity is still too low (Rantala and Laine 2010, Ersson et al. 2011) for planting machines to cost-wise compete with manual tree planting in southern Sweden (Ersson 2010). There is, therefore, a need to develop new planting machines concepts that are significantly more productive on Nordic terrain, i. e. clearcuts on moraine soils with varying prevalences of stones and stumps where the slash has been harvested for bioenergy. For over 40 years, simulation studies have proven useful for testing prospective forest machine concepts (e. g. (Sjunnesson 1970)), including different types of planting heads (Andersson et al. 1977). In particular, simulations studies can nowadays help to cost-efficiently evaluate new ideas before real world implementation (Jundén 2011). However, previous forest machine simulations simplified terrain characteristics like stumps, roots and stones {{to the extent that}} these models are too simplistic for meaningful <b>planting</b> <b>machine</b> simulations. For this reason, we have built several terrain, base machine and planting device models for use during discrete-event simulations to test potential solutions that realistically might increase Nordic <b>planting</b> <b>machine</b> productivity. These simulations were performed using a simulator built with the SimPy discrete-event simulation language (Jundén 2011). TERRAIN MODELS Presently, our terrain models encompass stumps, roots and underground stones. To delineate the clearcuts, we used Herlitz’s (1975) type stands for clearcutting. These type stands also provided theinput data necessary for sizing and spatially allocating the stumps. To all stumps, we attached a root plate according to the deterministic data from Björkhem et al. (1975) and a stochastic root architecture inspired by Kalliokoski et al. ’s (2010) root models. As concluded already during the 1960 s (Bäckström 1978), the presence of non-visible, underground stones and boulders is what makes mechanized reforestation on moraine soils so difficult. To model this difficulty, we used parameter values from Andersson et al. (1977) to define incidences of stones and boulders (boulder quota or stoniness) and mean stone sizes. Then, we chose an exponential distribution to link stone frequency to stone diameter. In accordance with Eriksson and Holmgren (1996), our modelled stones are spherical in shape and are spatially allocated in a random manner. BASE MACHINE MODELS Today’s planting machines use excavators as base machines. If using standard components, it might be techno-economically feasible to add another arm to the excavator; thereby creating two- (Fig. 2) or four-headed planting machines where planting head interdependence is minimized. We hypothesized that the productivity of two-armed planting machines, compared to normal one-armed machines, might especially be higher on obstacle-rich terrain since one arm could be free to move while the other arm is busy working. Moreover, two-armed machines might particularly benefit from additional task automation. Preliminary results, however, show that this productivity increase might not be high enough to warrant further development of our two-armed <b>planting</b> <b>machine</b> concept. PLANTING DEVICE MODELS We modelled today’s two most common planting devices, the one-headed Bracke Planter and the two-headed M-Planter. During simulation, the <b>planting</b> <b>machine</b> operator searches sequentially for microsites free from visible obstacles (stumps and main lateral roots). However, both devices can be impeded by underground roots or stones during mounding, and by stones during the planting phase. Striking obstacles with the M-Planter can result in delays for one or both heads. FURTHER DEVELOPMENT We are currently expanding the terrain models to include humus layers and surface boulders, on which new multi-headed planting device concepts (with two to four planting heads) with obstacle-avoiding capabilities are being tested. Those simulation results will provide guidance as to how future crane-mounted planting devices should behave and be designed in order to increase <b>planting</b> <b>machine</b> productivity...|$|E

40|$|The {{underlying}} {{reason for}} mechanizing tree planting in southern Sweden is the biologically good planting results produced by today's tree <b>planting</b> <b>machines.</b> Nevertheless, {{the productivity of}} these tracked excavators with crane-mounted tree planting devices is too low for them to compete economically with manual planting. The objective of this thesis was to investigate concepts for 1) seedling packaging, 2) base <b>machines,</b> 3) <b>planting</b> devices, and 4) seedling carousels that could cost-efficiently increase the productivity of today's <b>planting</b> <b>machines</b> in southern Sweden. Article I analyzed the cost-efficiency of two seedling packaging concepts that decrease {{the time needed to}} reload planting devices with seedlings. The analysis showed, however, that machine-specific seedling packaging was costlier than delivering the seedlings in their cultivation trays, although band-mounted seedlings will probably be the most flexible and cost-efficient packaging system as mechanized planting becomes more common. Article II and III used a discrete-event simulation tool and detailed terrain, <b>machine,</b> and <b>planting</b> device models to simulate the productivity of conceptual two-armed excavators and multi-headed crane-mounted planting devices. Two arms per excavator proved to be an inefficient concept for increasing the productivity of today's <b>planting</b> <b>machines</b> when compared to multi-headed planting devices. Although four planting heads per device was the most productive configuration on easy to moderate terrain, three-headed devices were best at combining high productivity with acceptable silvicultural results on all terrain types. Article IV used a test-rig to study the feasibility of tray-wise seedling reloading on today's most common planting device. Seedling reloading was twice as fast when done tray-wise rather than seedling-wise, and deplugging proved to be a reliable method of extracting seedlings from suitable cultivation trays even when performed at the excavator’s boom-tip during mounding work. Overall, this thesis confirms that there is high potential for technical improvements that increase the productivity and lower the planting costs of today's tree <b>planting</b> <b>machines.</b> Such improvements will likely include faster seedling reloading via tray-wise-loaded carousels or band-mounted seedlings, multi-headed planting devices that produce high quality planting spots using adapted soil preparation methods, and sensors that aid the operator in choosing microsites...|$|R

40|$|On Nordic clearcuts, today’s tree {{planting}} machines produce high-quality but costly regenerations. Much of {{this high}} cost {{is attributable to}} the planting machines’ low productivity. One promising way of raising productivity is to lessen the time spent manually reloading seedlings onto the carousels of crane-mounted planting devices. Using MagMat, a carousel test-rig designed by engineering students, we studied how much faster tray-wise seedling reloading is on the Bracke Planter compared to reloading with today’s seedling-wise-loaded carousel. The MagMat test-rig held eight Hiko cultivation trays from which seedlings were deplugged individually and dropped into the planting tube. The time study confirmed that seedling reloading was on average twice as fast with MagMat compared to today’s seedling carousel, thereby increasing assumed <b>planting</b> <b>machine</b> productivity by 8 - 9 % depending on the planting device used. MagMat’s cost-efficiency was analysed to be particularly reliant on its added investment cost, mechanical availability and how quickly trays can be switched automatically. Nevertheless, MagMat’s field performance illustrated the overall potential of tray-wise loading compared to piecewise seedling loading for increasing the productivity of crane-mounted planting devices. Also, deplugging {{proved to be a}} reliable method of extracting seedlings from the rigid, copper-painted Hiko cultivation trays even when performed at the excavator’s boom-tip during mounding work. We conclude that, rather than piecewise seedling loading, tray-wise loading combined with deplugging seedlings from suitable cultivation trays is a reliable and much more time-efficient method to feed seedlings on probably any type of tree <b>planting</b> <b>machine...</b>|$|E

The Bräcke tree <b>planting</b> <b>machine</b> was selected for the study, as it is capable of handling a wide range of site conditions and a variety of plant types and sizes. A qualitative analysis of the col-lected data showed that, in general, manual planting scored significantly higher than mechanised planting for plant position and planting quality.

On the reforestation site, plant growth after one growing season was investi-gated. No overall significant differences in height growth and root collar diameter increment were found in the first growing season between mechanised and manual plant-ing operations. Plants grown in ‘fen containers ’ had the highest relative increase in height growth and root collar diameter, irrespective of planting method. The results showed that the Bräcke <b>planting</b> <b>machine</b> was capable of planting a range of containerised plants to an acceptable standard on both reforestation and afforestation sites.
