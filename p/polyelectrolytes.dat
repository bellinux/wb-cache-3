Polycations and polyanions are <b>polyelectrolytes.</b> These groups dissociate in aqueous solutions (water), {{making the}} polymers charged. Polyelectrolyte properties are thus similar to both electrolytes (salts) and polymers (high molecular weight compounds) and are sometimes called polysalts.

40|$|Dynamics of {{colloidal}} flocculation of polystyrene latex (PSL) particles {{induced by}} cationic <b>polyelectrolyte</b> was studied {{in order to}} evaluate the effective layer thickness of adsorbing <b>polyelectrolyte</b> under sufficiently high ionic strength, where charges in <b>polyelectrolyte</b> chains are substantially shielded. The size of <b>polyelectrolyte</b> in the solution, ap, was evaluated by the viscometry and by dynamic light scattering (DLS). Normalizing method of end-over-end rotation was adopted to analyze the initial-stage dynamics of flocculation. The rate of coagulation of monodispersed PSL particles induced by simple salt monitored by the Coulter Counter confirmed to be proportional to the initial number concentration, thus validating the method of analysis. Drimethylamino ethylmethacrylates with nominal molecular weights of 4. 9 million and 2. 0 million were tested as flocculants.

2500|$|Acids are {{classified}} as either weak or strong (and bases similarly may be either weak or strong).

A [...] "weak" [...] polyelectrolyte, by contrast, has a dissociation constant (pKa or pKb) in the range of ~2 to ~10, meaning that it will be partially dissociated at intermediate pH.

2500|$|Recently, <b>polyelectrolytes</b> {{have been}} {{utilized}} {{in the formation}} of new types of materials known as polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs). These thin films are constructed using a layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition technique. During LbL deposition, a suitable growth substrate (usually charged) is dipped back and forth between dilute baths of positively and negatively charged polyelectrolyte solutions. During each dip a small amount of polyelectrolyte is adsorbed and the surface charge is reversed, allowing the gradual and controlled build-up of electrostatically cross-linked films of polycation-polyanion layers. Scientists have demonstrated thickness control of such films down to the single-nanometer scale. LbL films can also be constructed by substituting charged species such as nanoparticles or clay platelets in place of or in addition to one of the <b>polyelectrolytes.</b> LbL deposition has also been accomplished using hydrogen bonding instead of electrostatics.
