5|$|Elemental bromine is toxic {{and causes}} {{chemical}} burns on human flesh. Inhaling bromine gas results in similar irritation of the respiratory tract, causing coughing, choking, and shortness of breath, and death if inhaled in large enough amounts. Chronic exposure {{may lead to}} frequent bronchial infections and a general deterioration of health. As a strong oxidising agent, bromine is incompatible with most organic and inorganic compounds. Caution is required when transporting bromine; it is commonly carried in steel tanks lined with lead, supported by strong metal frames. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States has set a <b>permissible</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limit</b> (<b>PEL)</b> for bromine at a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.1ppm.

Acute CNS risks include: altered cognitive function, reduced motor function, and behavioral changes, all of which may affect performance and human health. Late CNS risks include neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia and premature aging. Although detrimental CNS changes are observed in humans treated with high-dose radiation (e. g., gamma rays and protons) for cancer and are supported by experimental evidence showing neurocognitive and behavioral effects in animal models, the significance of these results on the morbidity to astronauts has not been elucidated. There is a lack of human epidemiology data on which to base CNS risk estimates; therefore, risk projection based on scaling to human data, as done for cancer risk, is not possible for CNS risks. Research specific to the spaceflight environment using animal and cell models must be compiled to quantify the magnitude of CNS changes in order to estimate this risk and to establish validity of the current <b>permissible</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> (<b>PELs).</b> In addition, the impact of radiation exposure in combination with individual sensitivity or other space flight factors, as well as assessment of the need for biological/pharmaceutical countermeasures, will be considered after further definition of CNS risk occurs...|$|R

500|$|Approximately 35micrograms of {{beryllium}} {{is found}} in the average human body, an amount not considered harmful. Beryllium is chemically similar to magnesium and therefore can displace it from enzymes, which causes them to malfunction. Because Be2+ is a highly charged and small ion, it can easily get into many tissues and cells, where it specifically targets cell nuclei, inhibiting many enzymes, including those used for synthesizing DNA. Its toxicity is exacerbated {{by the fact that the}} body has no means to control beryllium levels, and once inside the body the beryllium cannot be removed. Chronic berylliosis is a pulmonary and systemic granulomatous disease caused by inhalation of dust or fumes contaminated with beryllium; either large amounts over a short time or small amounts over a long time can lead to this ailment. Symptoms of the disease can take up to five years to develop; about a third of patients with it die and the survivors are left disabled.

Career PELs are implemented to control late occurring health effects, including a 3 % risk of exposure induced death (REID) from cancer, and dose limits are used to prevent cardiovascular and central nervous system diseases. For radiation protection, meeting the cancer PEL is currently the design driver for galactic cosmic ray and solar particle event shielding, mission duration, and crew certification (e. g., 1 -year ISS missions). The risk of cancer development is the largest known long-term health consequence following radiation exposure, and current estimates for long-term health risks due to cardiovascular diseases are approximately 30 % to 40 % of the cancer risk for exposures above an estimated threshold (Deep Space one-year and Mars missions). Large uncertainties currently exist in estimating the health risks of space radiation exposure. Improved understanding through radiobiology and physics research allows increased accuracy in risk estimation and is essential for ensuring astronaut health as well as for controlling mission costs, optimization of mission operations, vehicle design, and countermeasure assessment.

40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{and others}} have {{conducted}} a number of occupational exposure surveys {{since the publication of}} the International Agency for Research on Cancer report of 1989 (1), which labeled diesel exhaust as a probable human carcinogen. These surveys have assessed diesel exhaust exposure using measurement of diesel aerosol and/or specific polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as indicators of exposure. This report reviews, available diesel exhaust aerosol and gas measurement techniques. Measurement of human exposure to toxic agents {{is the first step in}} determining the exposure-dose-response relationship. It is a fundamental step in risk assessment. Measuring exposure to diesel exhaust pollutants is particularly challenging due to the complexity and variability of exhaust components. This paper reviews current occupational health standards for diesel emissions and available diesel exhaust gas and aerosol measurement techniques. Although surveys in mines have primarily assessed diesel exhaust exposure using diesel particulate matter (DPM) some exhaust gas measurements have been used as indicators of exposure. DPM is emphasized because it is a major component of diesel exhaust, is suspected to make a major contribution to the health hazard, and is measurable. OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH STANDARDS Occupational exposure surveys of diesel exhaust frequently measure regulated pollutants, or pollutants that are suspected carcinogens, even if no <b>permissible</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> (<b>PELs)</b> have been established.

In a Small and medium (SME) scale spray painting process, therefore, proper safety and health risk management with an efficient engineering control such as ventilation system must be provided for human health. In this study, Hazards Identification, Risk Assessment and Risk Control (HIRARC) method with chemical monitoring was implemented and three suggested CFD based modelling of ventilation system have been analysed in a paint spray booth of a SME scale spray painting process. Based on HIRARC, the overall risk level at the selected spray painting working area can be classified to be at MEDIUM level due to lack of awareness among workers on practicing safe working procedures in workplaces.

The Toxic Potential Indicator (TPI) is a quantitative model based on European Union (EU) regulatory standards for toxicity and environmental quality. Here, we describe a version of TPI that we developed with US regulatory thresholds for environmental and human health impacts of toxic materials. The customized US-based TPI (USTPI) model integrates occupational <b>permissible</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> (<b>PELs),</b> carcinogen categories based on the scheme of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), and median effect concentration for acute aquatic toxicity (EC 50 s).

Statistical analyses show that the median difference between USTPI and EUTPI scores do not approximate to zero, implying a general discrepancy in TPI score results. Comparison of chemical ranking with Spearman's correlation coefficient suggests a positive but imperfect rank correlation. Although some discrepancies between EUTPI and USTPI may be explained by missing toxicity information in some regulatory categories, disparities between the 2 models are associated mostly with different input parameters, i. e., different regulatory thresholds and guidelines. These results demonstrate that regional differences in regulatory thresholds for material toxicity may compromise the ideals of international agreements, such as the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals, and emphasis needs to be placed on eliminating inconsistencies in hazard assessment frameworks for substances...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{examines the}} occupational health {{risks associated with}} welding, brazing, and thermal cutting, and it provides criteria for eliminating or minimizing the risks encountered by workers in these occupations. The main health concerns are increased risks of lung cancer and acute or chronic respiratory disease. The data in this document indicate that welders have a 40 % increase in relative risk of developing lung cancer {{as a result of}} their work experience. The basis for this excess risk is difficult to determine because of uncertainties about smoking habits, possible interactions among the various components of welding emissions, and possible exposures to other occupational carcinogens. However, the risk of lung cancer for workers who weld on stainless steel appears to be associated with exposure to fumes that contain nickel and chromium. The severity and prevalence of noncarcinogenic respiratory conditions are not well characterized among welders, but they have been observed in both smoking and nonsmoking workers in occupations associated with welding. Excesses in morbidity and mortality among welders exist even when reported exposures are below current Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) <b>permissible</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> (<b>PELs)</b> for the many individual components of welding emissions. An <b>exposure</b> <b>limit</b> for total welding emissions cannot be established because the composition of welding fumes and gases varies for different welding processes and because the various components of a welding emission may interact to produce adverse health effects. Some of these include alkali metals, alkaline earths, aluminum, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, fluorides, iron, lead, manganese, nickel, silica, titanium, zinc, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and ozone. NIOSH therefore recommends that exposures to all welding emissions be reduced to the lowest feasible concentrations using state-of-the-art engineering controls and work practices. <b>Exposure</b> <b>limits</b> for individual chemical or physical agents are to be considered upper boundaries of exposure.

Humans are considered a system {{in the design of}} any such deep-space exploration mission, and exploration of NEA presents unique challenges for the human system. Key factors that define the mission are those that are strongly affected by distance and duration. The most critical of these is deep-space radiation exposure without even the temporary shielding of a nearby large planetary body. The current space radiation <b>permissible</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> (<b>PEL)</b> restrict mission duration to 3 - 10 months depending on age and gender of crewmembers and stage of the solar cycle. Factors that affect mission architecture include medical capability; countermeasures for bone, muscle, and cardiovascular atrophy during continuous weightlessness; restricted food supplies; and limited habitable volume. The design of a habitat that can maintain the physical and psychological health of the crew and support mission operations with limited intervention from Earth will require an integrated research and development effort by NASA s Human Research Program, engineering, and human factors groups. Limited abort and return options for an NEA mission are anticipated to have important effects on crew psychology as well as influence medical supplies and training requirements of the crew. Other important factors are those related to isolation, confinement, communication delays, autonomous operations, task design, small crew size, and even the unchanging view outside the windows for most of the mission. Geological properties of the NEA will influence design of sample handling and containment, and extravehicular activity capabilities including suit ports and tools. A robotic precursor mission that collects basic information on NEA surface properties would reduce uncertainty about these aspects of the mission as well as aid in design of mission architecture and exploration tasks...|$|R
40|$|In January 2005, the President {{proposed}} a new initiative, the Vision for Space Exploration. To accomplish the goals within the vision for space exploration, physicians and researchers at Johnson Space Center are establishing spaceflight health standards. These standards include {{fitness for duty}} criteria (FFD), <b>permissible</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limits</b> (<b>PELs),</b> and <b>permissible</b> outcome limits (POLs). POLs delineate an acceptable maximum decrement or change in a physiological or behavioral parameter, {{as the result of}} exposure to the space environment. For example cardiovascular fitness for duty standards might be a measurable clinical parameter minimum that allows successful performance of all required duties. An example of a <b>permissible</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>limit</b> for radiation might be the quantifiable <b>limit</b> of <b>exposure</b> over a given length of time (e. g. life time radiation exposure). An example of a permissible outcome limit might be the length of microgravity exposure that would minimize bone loss. The purpose of spaceflight health standards is to promote operational and vehicle design requirements, aid in medical decision making during space missions, and guide the development of countermeasures. Standards will be based on scientific and clinical evidence including research findings, lessons learned from previous space missions, studies conducted in space analog environments, current standards of medical practices, risk management data, and expert recommendations. To focus the research community on the needs for exploration missions, NASA has developed the Bioastronautics Roadmap. The Bioastronautics Roadmap, NASA's approach to identification of risks to human space flight, revised baseline was released in February 2005. This document was reviewed by the Institute of Medicine in November 2004 and the final report was received in October 2005. The roadmap defines the most important research and operational needs that will be used to set policy, standards (define acceptable risk), and implement an overall Risk Management and Analysis process. Currently NASA is drafting spaceflight health standards for neurosensory alterations, space radiation exposure, behavioral health, muscle atrophy, cardiovascular fitness, immunological compromise, bone demineralization, and nutrition...|$|R
