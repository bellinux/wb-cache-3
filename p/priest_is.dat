5|$|The {{organization}} {{is led by}} a high priest/priestess, {{who is also the}} public face of the Temple. The high <b>priest</b> <b>is</b> chosen among fourth or higher degree members by the chairman of the Council of Nine. This ruling council has nine members chosen from the priesthood (third degree or higher), whose mandate lasts for nine years with a new member being elected every year. The chairman of the council is chosen from among the council members each year. The council has the ultimate ruling power in the Temple and even the high <b>priest</b> <b>is</b> responsible to it. The Temple also has an executive director, whose task is to deal with administrative issues.|$|E

50|$|The war had a {{profound}} effect on the Church. Between 1926 and 1934 at least 40 <b>priests</b> <b>were</b> killed. Between 1926 and 1934, over 3,000 <b>priests</b> <b>were</b> exiled or assassinated.|$|R
50|$|In February, a Roman Catholic <b>priest</b> <b>was</b> shot {{to death}} and a church was burned down. In the past, another <b>priest</b> <b>was</b> shot and wounded and other churches were also burned.|$|R
5|$|Since {{the time}} of de Vaux, the default {{assumption}} {{has been that the}} Wicked <b>Priest</b> <b>is</b> a single individual, if only because of the appealing parallelism to the Teacher of Righteousness. The consensus time period for the founding of Qumran (150-140 BCE) includes five High Priests: three Hellenized and two Maccabean: Jason, Menelaus, Alcimus, Jonathan, and Simon, and also the various figures potentially associated with the intersacerdotium.|$|E

5000|$|Hindu <b>priests</b> <b>are</b> {{known to}} perform {{services}} {{often referred to}} as puja. <b>Priests</b> <b>are</b> identified as pandits or pujaris amongst devotees. <b>Priests</b> <b>were</b> the instigating factor to why ordinary people of Hindu religion became indulged severely in a devotional path. Hindu priests through their extended knowledge of the literature, the Bhagavad Gita and the Ramayana were able to encourage the Hindu community's devotion to Hindu deities.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ceremonial}} of consecration, {{extending through}} an entire week (-; [...] ), included certain rites which all <b>priests</b> <b>were</b> required to undergo: purification; the sacrifices; the [...] "filling" [...] of the hands; the smearing with blood. But Aaron the high <b>priest</b> <b>was</b> anointed with sacred oil, hence {{the title of}} the [...] "anointed priest"; other passages have it that all <b>priests</b> <b>were</b> anointed ( [...] , , [...] ).|$|R
50|$|Novices of Heironeous {{are known}} as the Blessed. Full <b>priests</b> <b>are</b> called the Glorious or, collectively, the Valorous Host. Other titles used by Heironian <b>priests</b> <b>are</b> Hero of the Third Rank, Hero of the Second Rank, Hero of the First Rank, Champion of Glory, Knight Gallant, Knight Courageous, Knight Valiant, and Knight Champion. Senior <b>priests</b> <b>are</b> called Paragons, while those who command armies {{are known as}} Paragon-Generals. These titles are {{separate}} from duty-titles such as postulant, novitiate, professed priest, cloistered cleric, affirmed priest, and templar. They are also separate from ranks within the temple hierarchy such as hierodeacon and abbot. In everyday use, senior <b>priests</b> <b>are</b> called Father or Mother, while lesser <b>priests</b> <b>are</b> known as Brother or Sister. There is also an elite order of priests known as the gloryaxes.|$|R
5|$|The name also {{occurs in}} the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, s.a. 501, as Bieda, one of {{the sons of the}} Saxon founder of Portsmouth. The Liber Vitae of Durham Cathedral names two priests with this name, one of whom is presumably Bede himself. Some manuscripts of the Life of Cuthbert, one of Bede's works, mention that Cuthbert's own priest was named Bede; it is {{possible}} that this <b>priest</b> <b>is</b> the other name listed in the Liber Vitae.|$|E
5|$|If he accepts, and {{is already}} a bishop, he {{immediately}} takes office. If {{he is not a}} bishop, however, he must be first consecrated as one before he can assume office. If a <b>priest</b> <b>is</b> elected, the Cardinal Dean consecrates him bishop; if a layman is elected, then the Cardinal Dean first ordains him deacon, then priest, and only then consecrates him as bishop. Only after becoming a bishop does the pope-elect take office. These functions of the Dean are assumed, if necessary, by the sub-Dean, and if the sub-Dean is also impeded, they are assumed by the senior cardinal-bishop in attendance. In 2005 the Dean himself—Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger—was elected pope. In 2013, the Dean and sub-Dean were not in attendance (over the age limit), and these functions were assumed by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re.|$|E
5|$|St Edwen's, {{which is}} used for worship by the Church in Wales, is one of seven churches in the {{combined}} benefice (churches grouped together under an incumbent priest) of Bro Dwynwen.

As of 2016, the priest in charge is the Reverend E Roberts and the associate <b>priest</b> <b>is</b> Canon Professor Leslie Francis.|$|E
50|$|Eadro's {{priests and}} shamans wear sand-colored clothing. They serve their communities, {{upholding}} traditional values (which differ significantly {{between the two}} races). Merfolk <b>priests</b> <b>are</b> suspicious, stern, and xenophobic, while locathah <b>priests</b> <b>are</b> more worldly, though still cautious and thoughtful.|$|R
2500|$|The burnt {{offering}} ( [...] , olah) was to burn on {{the altar}} until morning, when the <b>priest</b> <b>was</b> to clear the ashes to a place outside the camp. The <b>priests</b> <b>were</b> to keep the fire burning, every morning feeding it wood.|$|R
50|$|Of the <b>priests</b> who <b>were</b> {{accused of}} sexual abuse, 59% {{were accused of}} a single allegation. 41% of the <b>priests</b> <b>were</b> the subject {{of more than one}} allegation. Just under 3% of the <b>priests</b> <b>were</b> the subject of ten or more {{allegations}}. The 149 priests who had more than 10 allegations against them accounted for 2,960 {{of the total number of}} allegations.|$|R
5|$|The Fens were {{increasingly}} cultivated after the Napoleonic Wars, prompting migrant Catholic Irish farm-workers {{to move to}} the area. By 1879 a Roman Catholic missionary, Father Hermann Sabela, was conducting services in the town. A Catholic school and chapel were built in 1881 on land in Jermyn Street and in 1888, Our Lady of Good Counsel Roman Catholic Church, opened beside it. The incumbent <b>priest</b> <b>is</b> Father Michael John Bell, who was appointed in 2001. Mass is held on Sundays and throughout the week.|$|E
5|$|The groom Shiva {{is shown}} calm and young, while Parvati is {{depicted}} as shy and emotional. Her head is tilted towards him and her eyelids joyfully lowered, while his hand (now broken) is holding hers. Their dress reflect the Hindu customs. He wears the sacred thread across his chest, she the customary jewelry. The other characters shown in the wedding carry items or are shown holding items that typically grace a Hindu wedding. Chandra (moon god), for example, holds a traditionally decorated water vessel (kalash). Brahma, the <b>priest,</b> <b>is</b> squatting {{on the floor to}} the right tending the yajna fire (agni mandapa).|$|E
5|$|When a Catholic <b>priest</b> <b>is</b> burnt at {{the stake}} in Lander, Wyoming, private investigative {{organisation}} the Millennium Group despatch offender profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Ardis Cohen (Lindsay Crouse) who had previously worked together on a case involving the murders of three clerics several years earlier. Black sees similarities between the murders and the methods of torture employed by the medieval Inquisition. This is confirmed when a Protestant minister is drowned in imitation of another ritual torture. At {{the scene of the}} drowning, two wedding rings are found—a man's in the stomach of the victim and woman's nearby.|$|E
5000|$|High <b>Priests</b> <b>are</b> {{regarded}} as [...] "ministers of vision." [...] They {{can be called}} to serve {{in any of the}} offices of the priesthood and there are several specialized callings within this office. Collectively the High <b>Priests</b> <b>are</b> the Quorum of the High <b>Priests.</b> It <b>is</b> desired that the pastor or presiding officer of a large well established congregation is a High Priest.|$|R

5|$|In the South Indian {{kingdom of}} Cholapuram Paalayam {{in the year}} 1771, Raja Mokkaiyappar and his queen, Rajamatha Bhavani Ammaiyar are desperate for a child, as all their {{previous}} twenty-two children have died at birth. Unknown to them, Bhavani's brother, Sangilimayan, {{who is also the}} Rajaguru (High <b>priest),</b> <b>is</b> {{responsible for the death of}} their children. Sangilimayan is shocked to see that his sister has given birth to twins. Before informing the king about the birth, he calls the palace astrologer, Chinnavadayaan, who predicts that the elder twin will be incapable of making decisions on his own while the younger one will be smarter. Sangilimayan orders the palace doctor, Kailasakaruppan, to kill the younger one, but Chinnavadayaan tells Sangilimayan that his actions would not be good for the kingdom. Instead, Sangilimayan orders the palace doctor to abandon the child in a nearby river. The elder child is named Pulikecei XXIII. Maragathavalli, Kailasakaruppan's childless wife, rescues the abandoned child from the river, and the couple decides to raise him as their own, naming him Ukraputhan.|$|E
5|$|Although Badrinath {{is located}} in North India, the head priest, or Rawal, is {{traditionally}} a Nambudiri Brahmin chosen from the South Indian state of Kerala. This tradition {{is believed to have}} been initiated by Adi Shankara, who was a South Indian philosopher. The Rawal (chief <b>priest)</b> <b>is</b> requested by the Government of Uttarakhand (Uttar Pradesh government before the formation of Uttarakhand state) to the Kerala Government. The candidate should possess a degree of Acharya in Sanskrit, be a bachelor, well-versed in reciting mantras (sacred texts) and be from the Vaishnava sect of Hinduism. The erstwhile ruler of Garhwal, who is the tutelary head of Badrinath, approves the candidate sent by the Government of Kerala. A Tilak Ceremony is held to instate the Rawal and he is deputed from April to November, when the temple remains open. The Rawal is accorded high holiness status by Garhwal Rifles and the state governments of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh. He is also held in high esteem by the Royals of Nepal. From April to November, he performs his duties as a temple priest. Thereafter, he either stays in Joshimutt or returns to his native village in Kerala. The duties of the Rawal starts at 4 a.m. every day with the Abhisheka. He should not cross the river until Vamana Dwadasi and must adhere to Brahmacharya. The Rawal is assisted by the Garhwali Dimri Pundits belonging to the Village Dimmer, Nayab Rawals, Dharmadikari, Vedapathi, a group of priests, Pandas Samadhini, Bhandari, Rasoiyas (cook), devotional singer, clerk of devashram, Jal Bhariya (water keeper) and temple guards. Badrinath is one of the few temples in North India that follow the ancient Tantra-Vidhi of Shrauta tradition more common in the south.|$|E

25|$|A {{clerical}} {{career was}} not a route chosen by upper-class society. Most parish <b>priests</b> <b>were</b> sons of <b>priests,</b> <b>were</b> very poorly educated, and very poorly paid. The monks in the monasteries had a slightly higher status; they {{were not allowed to}} marry. Politically, the church was impotent.|$|R
50|$|Law at the time, {{such as the}} Jesuits, etc. Act 1584, made it treason to <b>be</b> a Catholic <b>priest</b> in England and {{therefore}} Catholic <b>priests</b> <b>were</b> typically hung,drawn and quartered. Laymen convicted of assisting <b>priests</b> <b>were</b> usually sentenced to the lesser punishment of execution by hanging.|$|R
25|$|In Toledo, 286 of 600 <b>priests</b> <b>were</b> killed.|$|R
25|$|<b>Priest</b> <b>is</b> {{the third}} {{office in the}} Aaronic priesthood; this office given the males ages 16 and older. The primary duties of a <b>priest</b> <b>is</b> to bless the sacrament and {{participate}} in home teaching. Priests also {{have the authority to}} baptize individuals who choose to become members of the church. A priest can also confer the Aaronic priesthood or ordain others to the office of deacon, teacher, or priest.|$|E
25|$|Receiving {{the sacrament}} of penance from a <b>priest</b> <b>is</b> {{distinct}} from receiving pastoral counseling or psychotherapy (without confession of absolution) from a priest – even if that <b>priest</b> <b>is</b> one's spiritual director {{or a member of}} the pastoral team of one's parish. The hierarchy of the Catholic Church have insisted on this point in order to avoid confusion, as both confidential processes have distinct roles in church life.|$|E
25|$|Wicked Priest: The Wicked <b>Priest</b> <b>is</b> the Teacher of Righteousness's main opponent, {{who also}} sought to kill the Teacher of Righteousness. The {{identity}} of the Wicked <b>Priest</b> <b>is</b> more clear {{than that of the}} Teacher of Righteousness, with scholars suggesting that he was a Hasmonean high priest such as Jonathan and Alexander Jannaeus. The Wicked <b>Priest</b> <b>is</b> referenced the most in the Commentary on Habukkuk, which states that the Wicked Priest was originally reliable, but once he became ruler he forsook God for riches and rebelled against God and committed abhorrent deeds. In the Commentary on the Psalms, the Wicked Priest sought to kill the Teacher of Righteousness for sending a law to him, some scholars have suggested that this law was 4QMMT. If the Wicked Priest was in fact Jonathan Jannaeus, then he met his own end in 142 B.C.E at the hands of Diodotus Tryphon, which would match well with the Habakkuk Commentary that comments on the terrible end met by the Wicked Priest.|$|E
