5000|$|Jatakarman is a {{composite}} Sanskrit word, with roots Jāta and karman. The word Jata (जात) literally means [...] "born, brought into existence, engendered, arisen, caused, appeared".

5000|$|The {{group was}} {{eventually}} signed to Sony Music. The group's first album, On The Floor of Heaven, released on Bumstead Records and distributed by Sony, was certified gold in Canada, for sales {{in excess of}} 50,000 copies. The group generated the interest of U.S. record executives, appearing at South by Southwest in 1994, among other U.S. showcases venues, but did not receive a U.S. record distribution contract. [...] The group also received a 1994 Juno award nomination as Best Country Group or Duo. [...] The group's second album, Lucky to Me was released in 1995 and was followed by regular touring by the band for the year thereafter. Both Blue Shadows albums were co-produced by Cowsill and Hatcher. Having not obtained international record distribution {{by the end of}} 1996, the group broke up, amidst [...] "creative differences" [...] which were, as acknowledged by Cowsill, precipitated by Cowsill's drug addictions. Cowsill's addictions impaired his ability to contribute to songwriting meetings with Hatcher, band rehearsals and, ultimately, band performances. The actual end of the band occurred during a three-day layover in Ottawa, Canada, when the band found that its van had crashed into a laundromat, after Cowsill had gone to retrieve a guitar. The band fulfilled its remaining contractual <b>performance</b> <b>obligations,</b> and then disbanded. Cowsill continued for a brief period with another band, using The Blue Shadows name.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a class of}} contracts in which parties write detailed, long-term <b>performance</b> <b>obligations</b> yet leave one or both parties broad discretion to terminate the agreement on short notice {{with little or no}} penalty. If the purpose of formal contracting is to make agreements legally enforceable, why would transactors go to the trouble of specifying complex price and <b>performance</b> <b>obligations</b> that either party can walk away from at will? The paper shows that formal contracts may be valuable, even where termination is the only sanction available to the parties, as a way of economizing on the cost of determining prices for a series of heterogeneous transactions. The theory is then used to analyze the structure of contracts between freight carriers and drivers and, in particular, the means by which haul prices are determined. Both the overall structure and pricing arrangements in these contracts support the proposition that ex post bargaining costs can affect the use and design of contracts {{even in the absence of}} significant relationship-specific investments. *Portions of this paper were previously circulated in Lafontaine and Masten (2002).

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{two different}} approaches to judicial protection of entitlements in international economic law. One of them, ‘performance-oriented’, is applied by WTO adjudicators. Performance-oriented remedies focus on inducing wrongdoers to resume compliance with the underlying substantive rules. The other, ‘reparation-oriented’, is applied overwhelmingly in international investment law. Reparation-oriented remedies aim at offsetting the injury caused to private parties by the wrongful conduct. This paper discusses the utility of performance-oriented remedies within WTO law, and assesses the possibilities for otherwise reparation-oriented investment tribunals to have recourse to these remedies. It examines a number of decisions that, it is argued, favor performance over pecuniary compensation. From the viewpoint of the state found in breach, compensation then appears as a threatened sanction for non-compliance with the <b>performance</b> <b>obligations</b> determined...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} the economic arguments for textualism and contextualism, the two primary methodologies used by courts {{to determine the}} intentions of contracting parties {{with respect to their}} <b>performance</b> <b>obligations.</b> Textualism, which is rooted in the idea of complete contracting, calls for a more restrictive approach to implied terms and interpretation than contextualism, which is rooted in the idea of incomplete contracts. The primary conclusions are that, as in other areas of contract law, the choice between the two interpretive methodologies depends on the transaction costs of drafting, the relative likelihood of court error, and the risks of opportunistic behavior. Neither methodology dominates so much that it should be uniformly employed, which is consistent with how courts actually behave. JEL classification: K 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} {{of the status of}} implied good faith <b>performance</b> <b>obligations</b> as an element of the Australian law of contract continues to lurk as a vital yet unresolved jurisprudential puzzle. Given the vital importance of contract as a foundation for commercial exchange and the potential for a good faith performance doctrine to materially impact the operation of contracts, this is an undesirable state of affairs. The evidence presented in this paper suggests that the approach taken to good faith performance has fragmented along jurisdictional lines. Further, far from representing a well developed and established doctrine, it has been the project of a very limited number of judges primarily drawn from just one state. These observations raise significant questions as to the legitimacy of the alleged doctrine. 20 page(s...|$|E

The proposals {{of the joint}} IASB/FASB-project Revenue Recognition feature an asset-liability approach relying on measurement at fair values or at allocated customer consideration amounts.

A pure fair value approach which yields irritating patterns of revenue recognition, is inappropriate for stewardship purposes, and unlikely to be adopted because of regulatory incompatibilities.
