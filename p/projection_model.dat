40|$|As test-based {{educational}} accountability {{has moved}} {{to the forefront of}} national and state educational policy, so has the desire for better measures of school performance. Past debates focused on the potential benefits of using value-added models to measure school performance. These statistical models represent the most sophisticated technique for assessing the unique contribution of schools to the learning gains of their students. However, recent national policy has shifted the discussion. The federally created Growth Model Pilot Program (GMPP) permits states to use <b>projection</b> <b>models</b> in their accountability systems. Most states involved in the pilot program are using <b>projection</b> <b>models</b> to give schools 2 ̆ 2 credit 2 ̆ 2 for those students who have not yet achieved proficiency, but have made sufficient learning gains such that they appear on track to become proficient in the near future. While value-added measures of school performance attempt to compare schools 2 ̆ 7 relative effectiveness, the proposed <b>projection</b> <b>models</b> are used to assess whether schools are effective at getting their students up to a fixed learning target—proficiency. ^ This dissertation has two components. The first is an empirical comparison of different state <b>projection</b> <b>models,</b> answering the questions: How accurate are states 2 ̆ 7 <b>projection</b> <b>models?</b> Are their goals realistic? The second is a comparison of three approaches to measuring school performance: the status model (used under No Child Left Behind (NCLB)), the <b>projection</b> <b>models</b> (used under the GMPP), and value-added models (used in some state accountability systems). ^ Findings suggest that the GMPP 2 ̆ 7 s <b>projection</b> <b>models</b> are not very accurate. Moreover, even if they were perfectly accurate, the GMPP 2 ̆ 7 s measures of school performance are so similar to NCLB 2 ̆ 7 s status measure that this new program is unlikely to have significant impact on the way we assess schools 2 ̆ 7 performances. In contrast, using value-added models would dramatically shift the focus of our education accountability system. Highlighted in this work is the inherent tension in the desire to compare schools 2 ̆ 7 relative effectiveness while simultaneously holding schools accountable for bringing all students up to high achievement levels. ...|$|R

40|$|Historically, matrix <b>projection</b> <b>models</b> (MPMs) {{have been}} {{employed}} to study population dynamics {{with regard to}} size, age or structure. To work with continuous traits, in the past decade, integral <b>projection</b> <b>models</b> (IPMs) have been proposed. Following the path for MPMs, currently, IPMs are handled first with a fitting stage, then with a <b>projection</b> stage. <b>Model</b> fitting has, so far, been done only with individual-level transition data. These data {{are used in the}} fitting stage to estimate the demographic functions (survival, growth, fecundity) that comprise the kernel of the IPM specification. The estimated kernel is then iterated from an initial trait distribution to obtain what is interpreted as steady state population behavior. Such projection results in inference that does not align with observed temporal distributions. This might be expected; a model for population level projection should be fitted with population level transitions.

5000|$|Under {{the contact}} hypothesis, several {{models have been}} developed. A number of these models utilize a {{superordinate}} identity to reduce prejudice. That is, a more broadly defined, ‘umbrella’ group/identity that includes the groups that are in conflict. By emphasizing this superordinate identity, individuals in both subgroups can share a common social identity. For example, if there is conflict between White, Black, and Latino students in a high school, one might try to emphasize the ‘high school’ group/identity that students share to reduce conflict between the groups. Models utilizing superordinate identities include the common ingroup identity model, the ingroup <b>projection</b> <b>model,</b> the mutual intergroup differentiation model, and the ingroup identity model.

40|$|KEY WORDS: {{orthogonal}} projection, orientation model, vision metrology, {{long distance}} observation The central perspective model is generally used in photogrammetry {{because of the}} high reliability, but it has a weak point that the initial values of orientation parameters are necessary due to the non-linearity. On the other hand, the model based on projective geometry, which is widely used in computer vision, can be treated as linear forms, but many indefinitenesses in the model leads to the lower precision and the lower stability. The authors developed an alternative model called the orthogonal <b>projection</b> <b>model,</b> which is as reliable as the central perspective model and does not need initial values of orientation parameters. The orthogonal <b>projection</b> <b>model</b> is derived from affine <b>projection</b> <b>model</b> with a constraint of orthogonality. The model is therefore appropriate to long distance observation like affine <b>projection</b> <b>model,</b> and it is also applicable to close range photogrammetry with high accuracy. This paper describes the derivation of the orthogonal <b>projection</b> <b>model</b> and the geometric characteristics, and also verifies the effectiveness by various simulations and a field test. ...|$|E
