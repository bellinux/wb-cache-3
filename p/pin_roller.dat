40|$|As train {{loads and}} travel speeds have {{increased}} over time, railway axle bearings have become critical elements which require more efficient non-destructive inspection and fault diagnostics methods. This paper presents a novel and adaptive procedure based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and Hilbert marginal spectrum for multi-fault diagnostics of axle bearings. EEMD overcomes the limitations that often hypothesize about data and computational efforts that restrict {{the application of}} signal processing techniques. The outputs of this adaptive approach are the intrinsic mode functions that are treated with the Hilbert transform {{in order to obtain}} the Hilbert instantaneous frequency spectrum and marginal spectrum. Anyhow, not all the IMFs obtained by the decomposition should be considered into Hilbert marginal spectrum. The IMFs’ confidence index arithmetic proposed in this paper is fully autonomous, overcoming the major limit of selection by user with experience, and allows the development of on-line tools. The effectiveness of the improvement is proven by the successful diagnosis of an axle bearing with a single fault or multiple composite faults, e. g., outer ring fault, cage fault and <b>pin</b> <b>roller</b> fault...|$|E

40|$|Carding is {{the primary}} step in the {{processing}} of staple fiber in which a disorganized matt of fiber tufts and clumps is converted into an even web of individualized and partially aligned fibers.

The secondary pinned surfaces are either rollers or flats and are called workers when in the form of rollers. The clearance between the pin sets is small, meaning that fiber tufts become caught in both sets of pins and the difference in speeds pulls the fiber clumps apart, individualizing and aligning the fibers.

5000|$|When {{drawing the}} {{conjugate}} beam {{it is important}} that the shear and moment developed at the supports of the conjugate beam account for the corresponding slope and displacement of the real beam at its supports, a consequence of Theorems 1 and 2. For example, as shown below, a <b>pin</b> or <b>roller</b> support at the end of the real beam provides zero displacement, but a non zero slope. Consequently, from Theorems 1 and 2, the conjugate beam must be supported by a <b>pin</b> or a <b>roller,</b> since this support has zero moment but has a shear or end reaction. When the real beam is fixed supported, both the slope and displacement are zero. Here the conjugate beam has a free end, since at this end there is zero shear and zero moment. Corresponding real and conjugate supports are shown below. Note that, as a rule, neglecting axial forces, statically determinate real beams have statically determinate conjugate beams; and statically indeterminate real beams have unstable conjugate beams. Although this occurs, the M/EI loading will provide the necessary [...] "equilibrium" [...] to hold the conjugate beam stable.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Roller {{conveyor}} {{chains are}} commonly used to transport goods in production lines or assembly lines, such as pallets, cars or steel coils. They are sometimes used in severe environments, soiled with water, foreign particles, chemicals or other contaminants. Normal use will result in wear {{of the components of}} the chain which can lead to unexpected failure and costly production downtime. Today, few literatures on the wear of conveyor chain are available and there are almost no reliable test-rigs to generate and measure chain wear in a reproducible manner. In this paper the different components of roller conveyor chains are designed for sugar bucket elevator used in sugar industries for 20 tonnes per hour capacity and the loading conditions are described. Additionally, the advantages of chain drive as compared with other drives are discussed. The chain wear mechanisms found in literature are listed.

By the 16th century, the difficulty of keeping the wagon running straight had been solved by having a pin going into a gap between the planks.
