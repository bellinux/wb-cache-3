5|$|Mug House {{is located}} on Wetherill Mesa; it {{contains}} 94 rooms, a large kiva, and a nearby reservoir. It received its name from four mugs the Charles Mason and the Wetherill brothers found strung together at the site. Oak Tree House and neighboring Fire Temple can be visited via a 2-hour ranger-guided hike. Spruce Tree House is the third-largest village, within several hundred feet of a spring, and had 130 rooms and eight kivas. It was constructed sometime between 1211 and 1278. It is believed anywhere from 60 to 80 people lived there at one time. Because of its <b>protective</b> <b>location,</b> it is well preserved. The short trail to Spruce Tree House begins at the Chapin Mesa Archeological Museum. The Square Tower House {{is one of the}} stops on the Mesa Top Loop Road driving tour. The tower is the tallest structure in Mesa Verde.|$|E

In a study {{it was found that}} their preferred prey aphids included the aspen leaf aphid Chaitophorus tremulae, the angelica aphid Cavariella konoi, the small willow aphid Aphis farinosa, the lime-tree aphid Eucallipterus tiliae, the birch aphid Euceraphis betulae and the mugwort aphid Macrosiphoniella artemisiae. They overwinter in leaf litter, crevices in the bark of trees and other similar <b>protective</b> <b>locations.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{defensible}} space {{theory is}} applicable to {{any type of}} planned space. From low density housing to high rises, the key {{is the development of}} a communal area in which residents can “extend the realm of their homes and the zone of felt responsibility.” Circulation paths and common entry are important aspects of defensible design as well. Residents must also feel a need to extend their <b>protective</b> attitudes to <b>locations</b> where property and urban streets and surroundings connect. The interfacing between private property and community space should be protected similarly. Newman’s intent in creating the principles of defensible space is to give the residents of a community control of public spaces that they formerly felt were out of reach. In effect, residents care enough for their area to protect it from crime as they would protect their own private property.|$|R
40|$|Background: Community {{misconception}} of {{what causes}} cancer {{is an important}} consideration when devising communication strategies around cancer prevention, while those initiating social marketing campaigns must decide whether to target the general population or to tailor messages for different audiences. This paper investigates the relationships between demographic characteristics, identification of selected cancer risk factors, and associated protective behaviours, to inform audience segmentation for cancer prevention social marketing. Methods: Data for this cross-sectional study (n = 3301) are derived from Cancer Council New South Wales' 2013 Cancer Prevention Survey. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used to investigate the relationship between respondent demographic characteristics and identification of each of seven cancer risk factors; demographic characteristics and practice of the seven 'protective' behaviours associated with the seven cancer risk factors; and identification of cancer risk factors and practising the associated protective behaviours, controlling for demographic characteristics. Results: More than 90 % of respondents across demographic groups identified sun exposure and smoking cigarettes as moderate or large cancer risk factors. Around 80 % identified passive smoking as a moderate/large risk factor, and 40 - 60 % identified being overweight or obese, drinking alcohol, not eating enough vegetables and not eating enough fruit. Women and older respondents {{were more likely to}} identify most cancer risk factors as moderate/large, and to practise associated protective behaviours. Education was correlated with identification of smoking as a moderate/large cancer risk factor, and with four of the seven <b>protective</b> behaviours. <b>Location</b> (metropolitan/regional) and country of birth (Australia/other) were weak predictors of identification and of protective behaviours. Identification of a cancer risk factor as moderate/large was a significant predictor for five out of seven associated cancer-protective behaviours, controlling for demographic characteristics. Conclusions: These findings suggest a role for both audience segmentation and whole-of-population approaches in cancer-prevention social marketing campaigns. Targeted campaigns can address beliefs of younger people and men about cancer risk factors. Traditional population campaigns can enhance awareness of being overweight, alcohol consumption, and poor vegetable and fruit intake as cancer risk factors...|$|R
40|$|The {{activities}} {{carried out}} by Udine University within Work-package nr. 1 (“Identification of structural typologies and of the requested damper/cable system characteristics”), for which it has had the role of task leader, consisted of the following main aspects: • 	elaboration of a finite element calculus code to model seismic response of frame and dual structures, incorporating damped cable (DC) protective system; • 	development of a wide numerical enquiry by means of this code, with the view of parametrically analysing {{the effects of the}} main mechanical quantities and design assumptions on performance of DC technology, as well as of identifying the structural typologies for which it can provide significant advantages (already assessing possible limitations and problems for practical implementation of the <b>protective</b> strategy); • 	<b>location</b> of preferable ranges of variation of the most critical mechanical parameters, by which to provide useful information for the construction of prototypes to be tested within Work-package nr. 2; • 	development of a preliminary numerical analysis on the mock-up building to be tested within Work-package nr. 7, so as to pre-evaluate dimensions and performance features of the system to be applied for that experimental campaign. The outcome of this activities is summed up in sections 1 through 4, enclosed to this report...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Research {{findings}} {{investigating the}} sociodemographics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been inconsistent and rarely considered {{the presence of}} intellectual disability (ID). METHODS: We used population data on Western Australian singletons born from 1984 to 1999 (n = 398, 353) to examine the sociodemographic characteristics of children diagnosed with ASD with or without ID, or ID without ASD compared with non-affected children. RESULTS: The profiles for the four categories examined, mild-moderate ID, severe ID, ASD without ID and ASD with ID varied considerably and we often identified a gradient effect where the risk factors for mild-moderate ID and ASD without ID were at opposite extremes while those for ASD with ID were intermediary. This was demonstrated clearly with increased odds of ASD without ID amongst older mothers aged 35 years and over (odds ratio (OR)  = 1. 69 [CI: 1. 18, 2. 43]), first born infants (OR = 2. 78; [CI: 1. 67, 4. 54]), male infants (OR = 6. 57 [CI: 4. 87, 8. 87]) and increasing socioeconomic advantage. In contrast, mild-moderate ID was associated with younger mothers aged less than 20 years (OR = 1. 88 [CI: 1. 57, 2. 25]), paternal age greater than 40 years (OR = 1. 59 [CI: 1. 36, 1. 86]), Australian-born and Aboriginal mothers (OR = 1. 60 [CI: 1. 41, 1. 82]), increasing birth order and increasing social disadvantage (OR = 2. 56 [CI: 2. 27, 2. 97]). Mothers of infants residing in regional or remote areas had consistently lower risk of ASD or ID and {{may be linked to}} reduced access to services or under-ascertainment rather than a <b>protective</b> effect of <b>location.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The different risk profiles observed between groups may be related to aetiological differences or ascertainment factors or both. Untangling these pathways is challenging but an urgent public health priority in view of the supposed autism epidemic...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decade, in-line skating {{has become an}} {{increasingly}} popular activity. Along {{with the number of}} reports, highlighting the number of injuries and their degree of severity, in-line skating injuries have to be considered a growing public health issue. The objective of this work is to report epidemiological knowledge about in-line skate injuries and ways of prevention. A thorough search of all reports and publications on the subject was performed through the Medline database and in references of selected publications. There are numerous case series studies and several observational ones, most of them undertaken in North America. In-line skates are used for recreation, sports, and transportation, {{in a variety of settings}} (parks, streets, bike path, etc.) and by most of age groups (5 to 71 years, median generally about 15). The most common site of injury is the wrist and forearm, although other parts of the body can be severely injured. Age, sex, physical training level, formal instruction level, lack of wearing of <b>protective</b> gear, skating <b>location,</b> may be risk factors for injury. Some preventive measures were proposed by a number of research workers (information campaigns, wearing of protective gear, instruction, laws, etc.). Several preventive attempts were undertaken but no one was appraised. In-line skates are used by all age groups and for a variety of activities. In-line skating is related to a great number of factors, such as cultural, social, geographic, urban and behavioural factors. Therefore, groups at risk for injury are very different. Emergence of an important type of injury should lead to the development of analytic epidemiological studies, based on particular groups of in-line skaters, in order to describe them, to identify and quantify risk factors and to design preventive measures, and then to appraise their efficiency...|$|R

Entrepreneurs are people who run the company, which is managing the company, better manage yourself, manage or through another person or the help of others, and employers may be an individual or legal entity. Safety is a program created for the workers / laborers and employers {{in an effort to}} prevent the occurrence of occupational accidents and diseases caused by working relations in the work environment by identifying the things that potentially cause accidents. The high number of accidents showed adequate management of the company in the implementation of the safety and health of workers. So, {{to reduce the number of}} accidents, it is considered very necessary to have legal protection against any employee or employment under the legislation. Especially employees working in the factory and factory workers who work at night are certainly at risk of work accidents is higher and nutrient intake or pudding is better than the employees who work in the office and other field. This type of research can be classified in this type of sociological juridical research, because this research author directly conduct research on the location or point examined in order to provide a complete and clear picture of the issues examined. This research was conducted at PT. Perkebunan Nusantara V Sei Garo Kampar, while the sample population is a whole party with regard to the problems examined, the data source used, primary data, secondary data and data tertiary, data collection techniques in this study with interviews and literature study.
