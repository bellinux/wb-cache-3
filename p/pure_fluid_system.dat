The control system consisted of a vortex-sink angular rate sensor, a pendulum controlled flapper-nozzle angular position sensor, a summing amplifier and bistable reaction jets. The system was designed to operate in a bang- bang manner {{in order to reduce}} errors in a minimum amount of time. A previous author's work on the vortex-sink angular rate sensor is extended to include information and data on proportional amplification of the output signal and the frequency response of the sensor. Methods for synthesizing the components into a working system are presented along with a theoretical analysis of the system's performance. Results of experiments performed on the completed system showed that the reaotion jets could be switched in a nearly optimal manner when responding to errors introduced {{on one side of the}} system, but, due to the unsymmetrical gain of the rate sensor, the errors introduced on the opposite side resulted in a certain amount of after end-point chattering.

In the case of depot formulations made of drug-loaded polymer microspheres, particle size significantly impacts the rate and duration of drug release. Thus, if particle size can be controlled, formulation characteristics can be engineered to better {{meet the needs of the}} specific situation. Cross-flow membrane emulsification (XME) is a method for manufacturing uniformly sized emulsion droplets which can be used for {{many applications}}, including production of drug-loaded polymer microspheres. In XME, a dispersed phase is forced through an orifice in a planar membrane into a simple shear flow set up by a second continuous phase flowing parallel to the membrane surface, thereby generating an emulsion.

The isentropic compressibility and sound velocity of thermodynamically equilibrated fluids exhibit important discontinuities at phase boundaries, as noticed long ago by Landau and Lifschitz {{in the case of}} <b>pure</b> <b>fluids.</b> In this work, the two-phase isentropic compressibility (or inverse bulk modulus) is expressed in terms of the two-phase isothermal compressibility, two-phase thermal expansivity and an apparent heat capacity, defined as the partial derivative of total enthalpy with respect to temperature at constant pressure and composition. The proposed method is simple (simpler than previous approaches), easy to implement and versatile; it is not EoS-dependent and it requires only a flash routine and the expression of total enthalpy at given pressure, temperature and composition. Our approach is applied to a variety of <b>fluid</b> <b>systems</b> representative of reservoir applications and geophysical situations, including petroleum fluids (oil and gas condensate) and mixtures of water and gas (methane or CO 2).

Measurements of condensation heat transfer coefficients and frictional pressure drop were taken over a range of mass fluxes (G = 150 – 450 kg m- 2 s- 1), a range of reduced pressures (Pr = 0. 25 - 0. 95), for two tube diameters (D = 7. 75 and 14. 45 mm), several working fluid-to-coolant temperature differences (ΔTLM = 3 – 14 °C) and temperature glides (ΔTGlide) between 7 - 14 °C. The wide range of conditions investigated in this study provides considerable insight on the transport phenomena influencing condensation in <b>pure</b> <b>fluids</b> and their mixtures. The trends in heat transfer coefficient and frictional pressure gradient are discussed and compared with the predictions of correlations from the literature. The results of the experiments, combined with previous flow visualization studies on hydrocarbons, were used to develop physically consistent heat transfer and frictional pressure gradient models that are applicable to <b>pure</b> <b>fluids</b> and zeotropic mixtures.
