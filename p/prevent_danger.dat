60|$|I {{was placed}} upon {{a table in}} the largest room of the inn, which might be near three hundred feet square. My little nurse stood on a low stool close to the table, to take care of me, and direct what I should do. My master, to avoid a crowd, would suffer only thirty people at a time to see me. I walked about on the table as the girl commanded; she asked me questions, as far as she knew my {{understanding}} of the language reached, and I answered them as loud as I could. I turned about several times to the company, paid my humble respects, said they were welcome, and used some other speeches I had been taught. I took up a thimble filled with liquor, which Glumdalclitch had given me for a cup, and drank their health, I drew out my hanger, and flourished with it after the manner of fencers in England. My nurse gave me a part of a straw, which I exercised as a pike, having learnt the art in my youth. I was that day shown to twelve sets of company, and as often forced to act over again the same fopperies, till I was half dead with weariness and vexation; for those who had seen me made such wonderful reports, that the people were ready to break down the doors to come in. My master, for his own interest, would not suffer any one to touch me except my nurse; and to <b>prevent</b> <b>danger,</b> benches were set round the table at such a distance as to put me out of every body’s reach. However, an unlucky school-boy aimed a hazel nut directly at my head, which very narrowly missed me; otherwise it came with so much violence, that it would have infallibly knocked out my brains, for it was almost as large as a small pumpkin, but I had the satisfaction to see the young rogue well beaten, and turned out of the room.|$|E

5000|$|Abulkosimkhon was {{the leader}} of the group in Tashkent, the defender of the people. At the same time, his {{position}} and authority, knowledge of Russian language, relations with the Russian proved that he had adjusted relations both with the friends and the enemies.Abulkosim was an educator ready to serve his people. It is confirmed by his signatures on particular documents, letters and statements - “khodim-ul-fukaro Abulkosim Eshon”. Then enlightener also signed his letters of “al-fahir Ubaydullokh”. Abulkosim, like Khozhi Akhror Vali [...] Abulqosim madrasasi, tried to serve the people, to alleviate their dilemma. And on this way, he even knew how to negotiate with the attackers.Abulkosim Eshon reconstructed “Khonakoyi muyi Muborak” in makhalla Beshegoch and near the madrasa he built a mosque, caravanserai, bath, trade stalls, bazar in order to restore this sacred place, to equip this district of the city(Beshegoch) and to introduce a new method of education and upraising of the young people.''''N.S. Likoshin'''' writes: “Abulkosim Eshon asked for forgiveness from the government for the riots in 1892”. [...] Also, the rebellion was headed by Abulkosim Eshon, and his investigative documents confirm it. However, in 1916 Lakoshin acquitted Abulkosim Eshon saying that “he asked for forgiveness from the government for this event”. Because Abulkosim Eshon enjoyed great prestige among the officers. And the reasons for his request for forgiveness was the following: Senior leader Inomkhuzha, Sharifkhuzha kazy and several other people were found guilty and sent to prison and moreover in the words of L.Klimovich, “angry Grodekov decided by any means to take revenge on the people, and began to show his ferocity. To <b>prevent</b> <b>danger,</b> the position of the city is writing a letter addressed to the Governor General. (It is quite possible that this document was hand-written by Abulkosim Eshon [...] ). The letter was signed by domla Mukhammadzokhir alam, domla Otazhon, Mukhammad Rahmatillo, Mukhammadolim Mirkozikhoz, Khakimzhon, Alikhon Makhmudkhuzha.The statement confirms Likoshin’s words that Abulkosim Eshon “asked for forgiveness” from the government and demonstrates how people and Government respected Eshon. Abdulkosim Eshon himself brought this letter to the Governor.Submitting letter to the Governor General of the Turkestan’s area, Abulkosim Eshon made a noble deed. Speaking Russian language very well and taking into account the interests of people, he called for strict governor not to the people any more. And the plague got more and more severe and killed more and more people.At the time of discussions. Abulkosim Eshon is said to predict an end of the epidemic of plague. On 4 July 1892 Abulkosim Eshon dies. Thousands of people attended his funeral. The plague stopped the same day.Here is how the Russian ethnographer Nikola Ostroumov described these events: “In old age, concerned about the recent events, Abulkosim later died of plague. Interestingly, after this the Tashkent people linked cessation of the plague with his passing. They said that the death of the person who devoted himself to serving Allah softens the God’s punishment sent to the wicked people”.Abulkosim Eshon actively participated in the socio-political life of the country, settled the issues related {{to the life of the}} population of Tashkent , and above all always remembered the interests of the people. In this regard, it is necessary to draw attention to two aspects. Transforming a small mosque into the center of education indicates well-understanding of this person. And this madrasa after Abulkosim’s death became the largest educational institution in Tashkent can be learned from the opinions of those who studied here and from the attention that the madrasa received from the General-Governor himself.|$|E

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{whether it}} is lawful in Australia to terminate one or more fetuses in a multiple pregnancy selectively and, if so, under what circumstances. It begins by addressing the preliminary question whether selective reduction is covered by laws relating to abortion and provides a brief outline {{of the law of}} abortion in Australian jurisdictions. The article then considers selective reduction of high-order multiple pregnancies, before turning to selective reduction of twin pregnancies in a range of circumstances. The article demonstrates that the law of abortion, as applied to selective reduction of multiple pregnancies, is uncertain and that there are considerable variations from one State to another. It concludes that the law in this area is in need of reform to recognise that some reductions are not performed prima facie to <b>prevent</b> <b>danger</b> to the mother's health and to remove the need for doctors to assert symptomatology of mental illness in order to guard against criminal law consequences. Further, {{there is a need to}} clarify whether selective reduction/termination is abortion for the purposes of the law, and to achieve greater consistency across jurisdictions.

Conscious efforts to establish security is a civilisational and cultural category which encompasses all aspects of contemporary security such as economic, social, cultural, political, legal, ecological and defensive, i. e all those manifestations of social life which come under the heading of social values. The efficiency of national security system today not only testifies to the capacity of the state to protect its fundamental social values from external and internal perils i. e. to preserve peace and liberty, <b>prevent</b> <b>danger</b> and fear, but also to its ability to ensure economic, political, scientific, technological and generally social development as well as people’s social, cultural, ecological prosperity.
