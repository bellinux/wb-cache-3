50|$|Portland airport has two runways.

50|$|Pilot-controlled {{lighting}} (PCL), {{also known}} as aircraft radio <b>control</b> of aerodrome <b>lighting</b> (ARCAL) or pilot-activated lighting (PAL), is a system which allows aircraft <b>pilots</b> to <b>control</b> the <b>lighting</b> of an airport or airfield's approach lights, edge lights, and taxiways via radio. At some airfields, the aerodrome beacon may also be ARCAL controlled. ARCAL is most common at non-towered or little-used airfields where it is neither economical to light the runways all night, nor to provide staff to turn the runway lighting on and off. It enables <b>pilots</b> to <b>control</b> the <b>lighting</b> only when required, saving electricity and reducing light pollution.|$|R
50|$|The airport {{can handle}} small {{aircraft}} {{as well as}} medium turboprops and jets, although little jet traffic is seen on its rather narrow runway.

Full and self-service fuel is available around the clock. The airport has an AWOS Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS) with data available continuously by radio and telephone.|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} {{aircraft}} creation in the MAI (Moscow Aviation Institute) began simultaneously with {{the foundation of}} the institute in 1930. The modern design bureau in the MAI was formed in 1965 as a students one. It was engaged in creation of experimental <b>pilot</b> and remote <b>controlled</b> <b>light</b> aircraft, which were developed according to the requirements specifications of various organizations of the Ministry of Aviation Industry (MAP), the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MGA) and the Ministry of Defense (MOP).|$|R
5000|$|Some {{installations}} include medium- or high-intensity {{approach light}} systems (abbreviated ALS). Most often, these are at larger airports but many small general aviation airports in the U.S. have approach lights {{to support their}} ILS installations and obtain low-visibility minimums. The ALS assists the pilot in transitioning from instrument to visual flight, and to align the aircraft visually with the runway centerline. Pilot observation of the approach lighting system at the Decision Altitude allows the pilot to continue descending towards the runway, even if the runway or runway lights cannot be seen, since the ALS counts as runway end environment. In the U.S., an ILS without approach lights may have CAT I ILS visibility minimums as low as 3/4 mile (runway visual range of 4,000 feet) if the required obstacle clearance surfaces are clear of obstructions. Visibility minimums of 1/2 mile (runway visual range of 2,400 feet) are possible with a CAT I ILS approach supported by a 1400 to 3000 ft ALS, and 3/8 mile visibility 1800 ft visual range is possible if the runway has high-intensity edge lights, touchdown zone and centerline lights, and an ALS that is at least 2400 ft long (see Table 3-5a in FAA Order 8260.3b). In effect, ALS extends the runway environment out towards the landing aircraft and allows low-visibility operations. CAT II and III ILS approaches generally require complex high-intensity approach light systems, while medium-intensity systems are usually paired with CAT I ILS approaches. At many non-towered airports, the <b>pilot</b> <b>controls</b> the <b>lighting</b> system; for example, the pilot can key the microphone 7 times {{to turn on the}} lights on the high intensity, 5 times to medium intensity or 3 times for low intensity ...|$|R

Using high-performance <b>pilot</b> <b>control</b> loaders (<b>pilot</b> <b>control</b> force) simulators and a computer Pilot Force Program (force-feel program), the Vertical Motion Simulator at NASA Ames Research Center continues to meet this challenge. The Pilot Force Program creates the pilot force-feel effects and has undergone, from its first inception, continuous improvements to meet simulation requirements. Real-time digital systems that use object-oriented programming languages, virtual instrumentation, high throughput I/O, and fast processors are now practical and cost-effective.

40|$|Flight {{simulators}} {{are widely}} used for research and training of pilots. However, in skill-based <b>control</b> tasks, <b>pilots</b> behave differently in the simulator compared to real flight due to limited visual and physical motion cues. This warrants a method which quantifies simulator fidelity by the differences between <b>pilot</b> <b>control</b> behavior in real flight and in the simulator. This paper {{presents the results of}} in-flight experiments to determine multimodal <b>pilot</b> <b>control</b> behavior in real flight, the baseline in determining simulator fidelity. The experiment is performed in a Cessna Citation II laboratory aircraft with a custom-built fly-by-wire system. To estimate pilots visual and vestibular responses, two forcing functions need to be inserted into the control loop at different locations. The fly-by-wire system was used to physically disturb the aircraft with a disturbance forcing function, while pilots had to track a target forcing function on a display in the cockpit. Both a multi-sine and a ramp target signal were tested in a roll and pitch control task, resulting in four experimental conditions. The results show that multimodal <b>pilot</b> <b>control</b> behavior can indeed be identified in real flight using the current fly-by-wire system setup. For two pilots, pilot model parameters could be estimated with high accuracy for all conditions. However, for the two remaining pilots, identification of multimodal <b>pilot</b> <b>control</b> behavior proved to be less straightforward...|$|R
