The first epoxide was introduced via nucleophilic epoxidation of the enone using potassium hydride and tert-butylhydroperoxide; this led to the formation of a 4:1 mixture of diastereomeric epoxides, favoring the desired isomer in which attack had occurred from the <b>peripheral</b> <b>face</b> of the enone. At this stage, the ketone was transformed into the second epoxide group using the Johnson-Corey-Chaykovsky reaction; notably, the product was formed as a single diastereomer, again due to initial peripheral attack of the dimethylsulfonium methylide nucleophile on the ketone. Subsequent removal of the TBS protecting group and Sarett oxidation of the resulting secondary alcohol completed the total synthesis of racemic periplanone B.|$|E
40|$|A recent event-related {{potential}} (ERP) {{study showed}} that the occipitotemporal component N 170 recorded to a face stimulus appearing in the peripheral visual field is strongly reduced when subjects are concurrently fixating another face stimulus. This suggests that concurrently presented face stimuli compete for neural representation in the occipitotemporal cortex between 100 and 200 ms following stimulus onset. We tested whether this competition can be observed for a foveally presented face stimulus appearing next to either two <b>peripheral</b> <b>face</b> pictures or two peripheral control stimuli. The N 170 {{in response to the}} fixated central face stimulus was substantially reduced (approximately 20 % of signal) when it was presented next to <b>peripheral</b> <b>face</b> stimuli. The response suppression was smaller in magnitude than in a previous study where the competing stimulus was fixated and the target stimulus appeared in the periphery. Besides providing a better control for attentional and eye movement confounds, the concurrent stimulation paradigm for fixated face stimuli in ERPs offers a powerful tool to investigate the time course {{and the nature of the}} interactions between face and nonface object representations...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} using flanker paradigms suggests that <b>peripheral</b> distracter <b>faces</b> are automatically processed when participants have to classify a single central familiar target face. These distracter interference effects disappear when the central task contains additional anonymous (non-target) faces that load {{the search for}} the face target, but not when the central task contains additional non-face stimuli, suggesting there are face-specific capacity limits in visual processing. Here we tested whether manipulating the format of non-target faces in the search task affected face-specific capacity limits. Experiment 1 replicated earlier findings that a distracter face is processed even in high load conditions when participants looked for a target name of a famous person among additional names (non-targets) in a central search array. Two further experiments show that when targets and non-targets were faces (instead of names), however, distracter interference was eliminated under high load – adding non-target faces to the search array exhausted processing capacity for <b>peripheral</b> <b>faces.</b> The novel finding was that replacing non-target faces with images that consisted of two horizontally misaligned face-parts reduced distracter processing. Similar results were found when the polarity of a non-target face image was reversed.

When compared with chairs, faces elicited larger N 1 amplitudes at lateral temporal electrodes and a midline positivity in the same latency range. The latter effect was only found for central faces. Attention to centrally presented faces was reflected in enhanced posterior N 1 amplitudes. This effect may be re-lated to an attentional modulation of processing within face-specific brain areas.

The identity task was confirmed to involve greater attentional load than the orientation task by differences in accuracy, reaction times, subsequent face recognition performance, and patterns of activation in several cortical regions. In the orientation task, ignored fearful faces led to stronger activation in the right amygdala than ignored neutral faces. However, this differential response was abolished when participants performed the difficult identity-matching task. Thus, emotional processing of peripheral faces in the amygdala also appears to depend on the available perceptual attentional resources...|$|E

Relying on visual crowding, a perceptual phenomenon whereby <b>peripheral</b> <b>faces</b> become undiscriminable, we show that participants exposed to happy vs. neutral crowded faces rated the pleasantness of subsequent neutral targets accordingly to the facial expression's valence. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) along with psychophysiological interaction analysis, we investigated the neural determinants of this nonconscious preference bias, either induced by static (i. e., pictures) or dynamic (i. e., videos) facial expressions. We found that while static expressions activated primarily the ventral visual pathway (including task-related functional connectivity between the fusiform face area and the amygdala), dynamic expressions triggered the dorsal visual pathway (i. e., posterior partietal cortex) and the substantia innominata, a structure that is contiguous with the dorsal amygdala. As temporal cues {{are known to}} improve the processing of visible facial expressions, the absence of ventral activation we observed with crowded videos questions the capacity to integrate facial features and facial motions without awareness. Nevertheless, both static and dynamic facial expressions activated the hippocampus and the orbitofrontal cortex, suggesting that nonconscious preference judgments may arise from the evaluation of emotional context and the computation of aesthetic evaluation...|$|R

While identical cueing effects were found with gaze and arrow cues, the more striking results concerned target stimuli. In Experiment 1, targets could appear on a <b>peripheral</b> <b>face,</b> or on scrambled face parts. Overall, greater cueing effects were found when the target appeared on a face. However, this face bias was only observed in participants with low AQ scores, whereas high AQ scorers oriented more to scrambled features. Experiment 2 found equal cueing to targets appearing on tools, as compared with tool parts. However, individual differences were again observed, where low AQ scorers showed larger cueing towards tools, while high scorers oriented more to scrambled parts, as in Experiment 1. These results support the idea that low AQ individuals orient strongly to objects attended by others. However, since the same results were found for arrow cues, this effect may generalize to all central cues to attention. High AQ scorers possessing many more autistic-like traits tended to orient more to scrambled shapes, perhaps reflecting a bias for orienting to local details...|$|E

40|$|Portulacaceae is a monogeneric {{family with}} around 100 species {{distributed}} around the world. Seed morphology is diverse in this group, and its variation {{has been used}} for taxonomic and identification purposes. However, documentation of seed morphology has focused on a few species complexes or has been limited to specific countries and geographic areas. Moreover, the terminology employed in different investigations is heterogeneous, thus complicating analyses of seed morphological diversity in Portulacaceae. In this study, the seed morphology of 58 samples representing 49 species, 9 subspecies, and 2 cultivars of Portulaca was documented with the use of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Based on the examination of the resulting images, a set of morphological features for describing the general shape of the seeds and their individual cell features is proposed; in addition, morphological descriptions for all taxa included in this study are provided. The results indicate that the shape of the seeds was constant within species, contrary to the characters that describe individual cell features, which showed important variation even within the same seed sample. In particular, the outline of the cells and the curvature of the anticlinal cell walls (ACW) were very variable, so a combination of character states was needed to describe the overall diversity of a sample. Conversely, the relief of the periclinal cell walls (PCW) was relatively constant throughout the seeds of the same species, but the relief of the cells of the lateral and <b>peripheral</b> <b>faces</b> was dissimilar in a number of taxa.

How do such {{reactions to the}} expression of emotion affect our goal-directed actions? Despite the substantial advance made in the neural mechanisms of both cognitive control and emotional processing, {{it is not yet}} known well how these two systems interact. Here, we studied how emotion expressed in human faces influences cognitive control of conflict processing, spatial selective attention and inhibitory control in particular, using the Eriksen flanker paradigm. In this task, participants viewed displays of a central target <b>face</b> flanked by <b>peripheral</b> <b>faces</b> and were asked to judge the gender of the target face; task-irrelevant emotion expressions were embedded in the target face, the flanking faces, or both. We also monitored how emotion expression affects gender judgment performance while varying the relative timing between the target and flanker faces. As previously reported, we found robust gender congruency effects, namely slower responses to the target faces whose gender was incongruent with that of the flanker faces, when the flankers preceded the target by 0. 1 s. When the flankers further advanced the target by 0. 3 s, however, the congruency effect vanished in most of the viewing conditions, except for when emotion was expressed only in the flanking faces or when congruent emotion was expressed in the target and flanking faces. These results suggest that emotional saliency can prolong a substantial degree of conflict by diverting bottom-up attention away from the target, and that inhibitory control on task-irrelevant information from flanking stimuli is deterred by the emotional congruency between target and flanking stimuli...|$|R

We now report that separate targeting motifs within both Pmp 47 and Pex 8 provide complementary function. Pmp 47 is an ATP translocator that contains six transmembrane domains (TMDs). We had previously shown that the TMD 2 region (termed TMD 2 R, consisting of TMD 2 and a short adjacent segment of cytosolic loop) was required for targeting to proliferated peroxisomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We now report that the analogous TMD 4 R, which cannot target to proliferated peroxisomes, targets at least as well, or much better (depending on strain and growth conditions) in cells containing only basal (i. e., nonproliferated) peroxisomes. These data suggest differences in the targeting pathway among peroxisome populations. Pex 8 p, a <b>peripheral</b> protein <b>facing</b> the matrix, contains a typical carboxy terminal targeting sequence (PTS 1) that {{has been shown to}} be nonessential for targeting, indicating the existence of a second targeting domain (not yet defined in S. cerevisiae); thus, its function was unknown.

40|$|Paleotemperature reconstructions from Antarctic ice cores rely {{mainly on}} δD and δ 18 O records, {{with the main}} key factors {{controlling}} their observed distribution in Antarctic surface snow being related to the condensation temperature of the precipitation and {{the origin of the}} moisture. Reconstructions of past sea-surface temperatures (SST) and sea ice cover (SIC) from marine cores at high southern latitudes mainly rely on diatom-based transfer functions. However, quantitative records of SST and SIC are concentrated in the mid-latitudes of the Southern Ocean and only few records exist in the Antarctic coastal areas. Here we present an overview of the Holocene climate records that have been compiled in the framework of the ESF-HOLOCLIP project, as well as a new isotopic record from the TALDICE ice core, recently drilled in a <b>peripheral</b> dome <b>facing</b> the Ross Sea. One of the main goals of HOLOCLIP is to reconstruct Holocene climate/environmental changes from ice and marine cores and integrate these data in model simulations. The main common features recognized in Holocene climate records obtained from ice cores are a warm early Holocene (from about 10 to 11. 5 ka BP), a cool period centred at ~ 8 ka BP and a secondary optimum peaking at ~ 4 ka BP. The Holocene climate reconstructions obtained from sediment cores demonstrate a warmer early-mid Holocene hypsithermal followed by a cooler neoglacial with an amplitude and timing of the transitions variable regionally around Antarctica. Though there exist some problems in both ice and marine core records (chronologies, temporal resolution, global vs. regional, annual vs. seasonal), such approach is unique to fuel paleoclimate models and to better understand the ocean-ice-atmosphere interactions at high southern latitudes beyond the instrumental period...|$|R
