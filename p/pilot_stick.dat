In the last two decades, {{there has been a}} renewed interest in modeling the human operator. There has also been significant work on techniques used to identify the pilot model of a given structure. The purpose of this research is to attempt to go beyond pilot identification based on collected experimental data and to develop a predictor of pilot behavior.

40|$|A {{quarter of}} all fatal General Aviation {{accidents}} in the UK during the period 1980 to 2006 involved Loss of Control (LoC) in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). LoC has consistently appeared in accident statistics over this period, but at apparently different rates for different aircraft types. This raises two important questions - why do these LoC events happen and why {{is there a difference}} between aircraft types?. One case in point is that of the Cessna 150 / 152 and over the 27 -year period analysed, the Cessna 150 falls approximately on the average for fatal accidents in the UK GA fleet, whereas the Cessna 152 exhibits a lower accident rate. Brunel Flight Safety Laboratory, in conjunction with the UK General Aviation Safety Council, undertook to try and understand why this is so. The key design differences in relation to performance and handling qualities were researched using available published material and informal interviews with type-experienced students, pilots and flying instructors. A flight test programme was conducted using examples of both aircraft types to gather additional research data, to assess and compare the apparent performance and handling qualities (both qualitatively and quantitatively). Flight tests were performed at three different CG conditions relevant to the key design differences, concentrating upon apparent longitudinal (static and dynamic) stability and control characteristics, stall and low-speed handling characteristics, and cockpit ergonomics / pilot workload. In all tests, normal (unmodified) flying club aircraft were used, in most cases with a 2 -man (TP+FTE) crew. Data was recorded manually on test cards and automatically using a low-cost, commercially available, portable FDR.

40|$|The Neural Flight Control System (NFCS) was {{developed}} to address the need for control systems that can be produced and tested at lower cost, easily adapted to prototype vehicles and for flight systems that can accommodate damaged control surfaces or changes to aircraft stability and control characteristics resulting from failures or accidents. NFCS utilizes on a neural network-based flight control algorithm which automatically compensates for {{a broad spectrum of}} unanticipated damage or failures of an aircraft in flight. <b>Pilot</b> <b>stick</b> and rudder pedal inputs are fed into a reference model which produces pitch, roll and yaw rate commands. The reference model frequencies and gains can be set to provide handling quality characteristics suitable for the aircraft of interest. The rate commands are used in conjunction with estimates of the aircraft s stability and control (S&C) derivatives by a simplified Dynamic Inverse controller to produce virtual elevator, aileron and rudder commands. These virtual surface deflection commands are optimally distributed across the aircraft s available control surfaces using linear programming theory. Sensor data is compared with the reference model rate commands to produce an error signal. A Proportional/Integral (PI) error controller "winds up" on the error signal and adds an augmented command to the reference model output with the effect of zeroing the error signal. In order to provide more consistent handling qualities for the pilot, neural networks learn the behavior of the error controller and add in the augmented command before the integrator winds up. In the case of damage sufficient to affect the handling qualities of the aircraft, an Adaptive Critic is utilized to reduce the reference model frequencies and gains to stay within a flyable envelope of the aircraft...|$|E

A series of parametric configurations was evaluated by six test pilots for several types of maneuver tasks. During the investigation, several incidents were encountered in which cockpit vibrations due to elastic modes fed back into the control stick through involuntary motions of the pilot's upper body and arm. The phenomenon, referred to as biodynamic coupling, is evidenced by a resonant peak in the power spectrum of the <b>pilot's</b> <b>stick</b> inputs at a structural mode frequency.

40|$|A flight {{investigation}} {{was made to}} obtain experimental information on the handling qualities of a normal-acceleration type of automatic longitudinal control system. The control system was installed in a subsonic fighter-type airplane. In hands-off (stick-free) flight the normal-acceleration control system attempted to regulate the normal acceleration to a constant value which {{is dependent on the}} automatic-control-system trim setting. In maneuvering flight a given <b>pilot's</b> <b>stick</b> deflection produced a proportional change in normal acceleration, the change in acceleration being independent of flight condition. A small side-located controller stick was used by the pilot to introduce signals into the automatic control system. In the flight program emphasis was placed on the acceleration-limiting capabilities of the control system. The handling qualities were investigated in maneuvers such as slow and rapid pull-ups and turns and also in flight operations such as cruising, stalls, landings, aerobatics, and air-to-air tracking. Good acceleration limiting was obtained with the normal-acceleration control system by limiting the magnitude of the input signal that the pilot could introduce into the control system. The same values of control-system gain settings could be used from an acceleration-limiting stand-point at both 10, 000 and 30, 000 feet for the complete speed range of the airplane. The response characteristics of the airplane-control system combination were also satisfactory at both high and low altitude with these same values of control-system gain setting.
