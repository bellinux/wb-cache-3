25|$|The <b>pin</b> <b>tumbler</b> lock is a lock {{mechanism}} that uses pins of varying lengths to prevent the lock from opening without the correct key. Pin tumblers are most commonly employed in cylinder locks, but may {{also be found in}} tubular or radial locks. The earliest pin-tumble locks were made over 4,000 years ago by the Egyptians. But due to their large, cumbersome size and since they were made of wood, the locks were not practical to use. In 1848, Linus Yale, Sr. invented the modern pin-tumbler lock. In 1861, Linus Yale, Jr. was inspired by the original 1840s cylindrical lock designed by his father, thus inventing and patenting a smaller flat key with serrated edges as well as pins of varying lengths within the lock itself, the same design of the pin-tumbler lock which still remains in use today.|$|E
25|$|Until 1998, {{when it was}} {{withdrawn}} from service, the WE.177 bomb was armed with a standard tubular <b>pin</b> <b>tumbler</b> lock (as used on bicycle locks) and a standard allen key was used to set yield and burst height. Currently, British Trident missile commanders are able to launch their missiles without authorisation, whereas their American colleagues cannot. At {{the end of the}} Cold War the U.S. Fail Safe Commission recommended installing devices to prevent rogue commanders persuading their crews to launch unauthorised nuclear attacks. This was endorsed by the Nuclear Posture Review and Trident missile Coded Control Devices were fitted to all U.S. SSBNs by 1997. These devices prevented an attack until a launch code had been sent by the Chiefs of Staff on behalf of the President. The UK took a decision not to install Trident CCDs or their equivalent on the grounds that an aggressor might be able to wipe out the British chain of command before a launch order had been sent.|$|E
50|$|A tubular <b>pin</b> <b>tumbler</b> lock, {{also known}} as a circle <b>pin</b> <b>tumbler</b> lock, radial lock, or Ace lock after its {{original}} manufacturer, is a variety of <b>pin</b> <b>tumbler</b> lock in which a number of pins are arranged in a circular pattern, and the corresponding key is tubular or cylindrical in shape. Most locks use between six and eight pins, although some use as few as four or as many as ten.|$|E
5000|$|Mr. Spain's unique locking {{principle}} of angled key cuts and elevating and rotating <b>pin</b> <b>tumblers</b> that provided millions of key combinations and {{a level of}} security that was unmatched in its time. The locks were highly resistant to most forms of attack. The company expanded rapidly and contracted its original name into Medeco. The company's present 130000 sq ft facility was opened in the mid 1970s.|$|R
50|$|Cost effectiveness: Because the {{manufacturing}} process {{is based on the}} <b>pin</b> and <b>tumbler</b> platform, the cost of manufacturing is significantly reduced when compared to high security locks with comparable security features. These high security locks often utilize new locking mechanisms which increase the cost of manufacturing.|$|R

50|$|Yale {{had many}} inventions {{to his name}} {{throughout}} his career, thoroughly revolutionizing the locks industry and improving the security of financial institutions. Drawing on the principles first put to use in large wooden locks built by ancient Egyptians, Yale patented a <b>pin</b> <b>tumbler</b> lock for use in banks in 1851; he patented his <b>pin</b> <b>tumbler</b> lock for use in doors in 1863; in 1865 he patented the <b>pin</b> <b>tumbler</b> padlock, which are still widely used today. Yale’s model of the padlock was smaller, sturdier, more reliable, and innovative, {{proving to be a}} distinction among locks of his day.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the combinatorial {{complexity of the}} algorithmic design of mechanical master key locking systems. Such locking systems use <b>pin</b> <b>tumblers</b> and prole elements (wards) to realize the functional dependencies given by a key/cylinder matrix. We prove that even very restricted versions of the masterkeying problem are NP-complete. We show that the general masterkeying problem can be dened by an integer linear program whose number of variables and restrictions is polynomial {{in the size of}} the key/cylinder matrix and the size of the locking system. Heuristic solutions are also discussed. 1 Introduction A master key system is a mechanical locking system for medium and large buildings. It enables various persons with dierent access authorizations to open all relevant doors with only one key. The main advantages of masterkeying are security with only a few keys, simple organization of a hierarchical authorization structure, and comfortable handling by only one key for all relev [...] ...|$|R

50|$|A {{wafer tumbler}} lock {{is a type}} of lock that uses a set of flat wafers to prevent the lock from opening unless the correct key is inserted. This type of lock is similar to the <b>pin</b> <b>tumbler</b> lock and works on a similar principle. However, unlike the <b>pin</b> <b>tumbler</b> lock, where each pin {{consists}} of two or more pieces, each wafer in the lock is a single piece. The wafer tumbler lock is often incorrectly referred to as a disc tumbler lock, which uses an entirely different mechanism.|$|E

50|$|Until 2004, Kryptonite locks {{used the}} tubular <b>pin</b> <b>tumbler</b> locking mechanism. In 2005, {{after it was}} {{demonstrated}} that the tubular <b>pin</b> <b>tumbler</b> locks used on Kryptonite locks could easily be opened with the shaft of a Bic ballpoint pen of matching diameter, Kryptonite changed their locks from the tubular to a disc mechanism, preventing the use of cylindrically-shaped objects to defeat the locking system.After this problem became public, Kryptonite offered a free exchange program for all owners of locks with tubular mechanisms.Kryptonite launched a Messenger Collection in 2015, created with input from actual bicycle messengers in New York City.|$|E
5000|$|Disk {{tumblers}} {{tend to be}} {{more difficult}} to pick than competitively-priced <b>pin</b> <b>tumbler</b> locks, and are often sold as [...] "high security" [...] locks for that reason. Picking the lock is not impossible but typically requires dedicated, professionally-made tools. They may also require relatively more time to pick. The disc tumbler lock cannot be bumped. This level of difficulty tends to drive attention to alternative methods of gaining entry. More expensive locks have 'false gates' which are similar to security pins on <b>pin</b> <b>tumbler</b> locks; catching the sidebar making one think they have picked a disk but in fact they have not.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pin</b> <b>tumbler</b> is {{commonly}} used in cylinder locks. In this type of lock, an outer casing has a cylindrical hole in which the plug is housed. To open the lock, the plug must rotate.|$|E

50|$|Lock bumping is a lock picking {{technique}} for opening a <b>pin</b> <b>tumbler</b> lock using a specially crafted bump key, rapping key or a 999 key. A bump key must {{correspond to the}} target lock in order to function correctly.|$|E
50|$|For a time, many U-locks used a {{cylindrical}} <b>pin</b> <b>tumbler</b> lock. However, most cylindrical locks can {{be picked}} by thieves using a common disposable Bic pen. U-locks with cylindrical pin tumblers should be avoided; though most manufacturers no longer offer them.|$|E
50|$|Higher {{security}} lever locks (such as the 5 lever) {{usually have}} notches {{cut into the}} levers. These catch the locking bolt and prevent it from moving if picking is attempted (similar to the security pins in a <b>pin</b> <b>tumbler</b> lock).|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} the wafer tumbler lock in the United States is the patent in 1868 by Philo Felter. Manufactured in Cazenovia, New York, it used a flat double-bitted key. Felter's lock was patented only three years after Linus Yale, Jr. received a patent for his revolutionary <b>pin</b> <b>tumbler</b> mortise lock, {{considered to be the}} first <b>pin</b> <b>tumbler</b> lock of the modern era. That lock featured a flat steel key, referred to as a [...] "feather key" [...] because of the marked contrast with the heavy bit keys of the day. Just two years later, Hiram S. Shepardson produced a different type of wafer tumbler lock, which used a single-bitted flat steel key, similar to Yale's feather key.|$|E
50|$|A common {{example of}} a linear cam is a key for a <b>pin</b> <b>tumbler</b> lock. The pins act as the followers. This {{behavior}} is exemplified when the key is duplicated in a key duplication machine, where the original key acts as a control cam for cutting the new key.|$|E
5000|$|Today's anti-picking {{methods in}} {{standard}} <b>pin</b> <b>tumbler</b> locks {{include the use}} of side wards which obstruct the key way, and [...] "security pins". These are shaped like a spool, mushroom, or barrel - with the effect that they feel as though they have set when in fact they have not.|$|E
50|$|Luggage locks are, by definition, low {{security}} locks. The shackles {{have a small}} diameter, and {{are easy}} to clip using bolt cutters or similar equipment. Luggage locks based on a <b>pin</b> <b>tumbler</b> lock design usually use {{only three or four}} pins, making them susceptible to lockpicking, even with tools as simple as a bent paperclip.|$|E
50|$|Mortise locks {{may include}} a {{non-locking}} sprung latch {{operated by a}} door handle. Such a lock is termed a sash lock. A simpler form without a handle or latch is termed a 'dead lock'. Dead locks are commonly used as a secure backup to a sprung non-deadlocking latch, usually a <b>pin</b> <b>tumbler</b> rim lock.|$|E
50|$|The basic <b>pin</b> <b>tumbler</b> lock {{alone is}} {{vulnerable}} to several lock picking methods and attacks, the most common being lock bumping and snap guns. To combat this, many higher security cylinders incorporate the use of specialised pins known as security pins which are designed to catch in the lock cylinder if a snap gun or bump key is used.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} a tubular lock {{is similar to the}} <b>pin</b> <b>tumbler</b> lock, in that there are several stacks of pins. The key is a {{cylinder}} shape with notches cut around the outer or (rarely) inner edge. Each of these notches depresses a single pin inside the lock to a specific height allowing the lock cylinder to turn freely.|$|E
50|$|A tubular key (sometimes {{referred}} to as a ace, radial or barrel key) is one that is designed to open a tubular <b>pin</b> <b>tumbler</b> lock. It has a hollow, cylindrical shaft that is usually much shorter and has a larger diameter than most conventional keys. Tubular keys are commonly found on vending machines, launderettes, bike locks (such as the kryptonite lock) and laptop security cables.|$|E
