5|$|A brawl scene between Johnson's and Diesel's {{characters}} {{was considered}} difficult to choreograph. The characters were written {{to be equally}} formidable, so the fight was <b>punctuated</b> <b>with</b> moments of character development, as Moritz felt this made the fight more exciting. The scene required several weeks of rehearsal {{and more than a}} week of filming by the actors and their stunt doubles, who incurred several minor injuries.|$|E
5|$|As other {{stations}} Holden designed, Acton Town station {{features a}} tall block-like ticket hall rising above a low horizontal structure housing the station offices and shops. The ticket hall has a projecting London Underground roundel sign over a canopy, the brick {{walls of the}} ticket hall are <b>punctuated</b> <b>with</b> panels of clerestory windows and the structure is capped with a flat concrete slab roof. From the ticket hall enclosed stairs descend to the platforms under integral concrete canopies on paired piers in alternating broad and narrow bay formation. A part of the narrow bays is infilled by kiosks, integral poster boards, roundel signs and fixed seating. The platforms are linked by a secondary bridge at the southern end. Reinforced concrete platform canopies replaced the original timber canopies. Since 17 May 1994, the station has been a Grade II Listed building.|$|E
5|$|At 0:35, {{the camera}} {{cuts to the}} {{aftermath}} of The Shot. A young man jumps {{in the air and}} pumps his fist as another young man in an opposing jersey sinks to the floor. The moment is from the 1989 NBA Playoffs, when Jordan hit a game-winning jump shot over Cleveland Cavaliers guard Craig Ehlo. At 0:38 is Jordan's last shot with the Chicago Bulls, after a crossover dribble past Utah Jazz guard Bryon Russell at the end of Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals. These scenes are musically <b>punctuated</b> <b>with</b> a bass drum roll and a cymbal crash. Finally, at 0:44 a young man shrugs after hitting a shot, as Jordan shrugged after scoring six three-point field goals {{in the first half of}} Game 1 of the 1992 NBA Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers.|$|E

60|$|This did {{not improve}} my {{condition}} any to speak of, but just then I observed that the colored porter of a sleeping-car had his eye on me. I saw his dark countenance light up. He whispered to the uniformed conductor, <b>punctuating</b> <b>with</b> nods and jerks toward me, and straightway this conductor came forward, oozing politeness from every pore.|$|R

5|$|Debates are <b>punctuated</b> <b>with</b> {{vigorous}} gestures which enliven {{the ambience}} of the occasion. Each gesture has a meaning. The debater presents his case with subtlety, robed {{in a formal}} monk’s attire. Some of the gestures (said to have symbolic value), made during the debates, generally subtle dramatic gestures are: clapping after each question; holding right hand and stretching left hand forward and striking the left palm with the right palm; clapping hands loudly to stress the power and decisiveness of the defender’s arguments denoting his self-assurance; in case of wrong answer presented by the defender, the opponent gestures three circles with his hand around the defenders head followed by loud screaming to unnerve the defender; opponent's mistake is demonstrated by wrapping his upper robe around his waist; loud clapping and intense verbal exchange is common; and the approach is to trap the defender into a wrong line of argument. Each time a new question is asked, the teacher strikes his outstretched left palm with his right palm. When a question is answered correctly, it is acknowledged by the teacher bringing {{the back of his}} right hand to his left palm. When the defender wins the debate he makes an allegorical dig at the questioner by questioning his basic wisdom as a Buddhist.|$|E

5000|$|The song's lyrics {{express the}} singer's sexual {{desire for the}} Jemima of the title. [...] The Band FAQ author Peter Aaron notes that it [...] "builds on the amorous hubris" [...] of the group's single from the album, [...] "Rag Mama Rag." [...] Sexual double entendres in the song include the singer's offer that “I’ll bring over my Fender, and I’ll play all night for you,” which Robertson <b>punctuates</b> <b>with</b> a lead guitar riff. [...] Another line states that [...] "I hand you my rod and you hand me that line." [...] Steve Millward interprets [...] "Jemima Surrender" [...] as a [...] "gently satirical" [...] song about [...] "a hapless country bumpkin" [...] who can't control his girlfriend." ...|$|R

25|$|A {{fishing village}} is a village, usually located near a fishing ground, with an economy based on {{catching}} fish and harvesting seafood. The continents and islands {{around the world}} have coastlines totalling around 356,000 kilometres (221,000mi). From Neolithic times, these coastlines, as well as the shorelines of inland lakes and the banks of rivers, have been <b>punctuated</b> <b>with</b> fishing villages. Most surviving fishing villages are traditional.|$|E
25|$|Adams's fictional Guide is an {{electronic}} guidebook {{to the entire}} universe, originally published by Megadodo Publications, {{one of the great}} publishing houses of Ursa Minor Beta. The narrative of the various versions of the story are frequently <b>punctuated</b> <b>with</b> excerpts from the Guide. The voice of the Guide (Peter Jones in the first two radio series and TV versions, later William Franklyn in the third, fourth and fifth radio series, and Stephen Fry in the movie version), also provides general narration.|$|E
25|$|Black Flag's sound mixed the raw {{simplicity}} of the Ramones with atonal guitar solos and, in later years, frequent tempo shifts. The lyrics were written mostly by Ginn, and like other punk bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s, Black Flag voiced an anti-authoritarian and nonconformist message, in songs <b>punctuated</b> <b>with</b> descriptions of social isolation, neurosis, poverty, and paranoia. These themes were explored further when Henry Rollins joined the band as lead singer in 1981. Most of the band's material was released on Ginn's independent record label SST Records.|$|E

25|$|Arthur's post-retirement work {{in theater}} was intermittent, {{somewhat}} curtailed by her unease and discomfort about working in public. Capra claimed she vomited in her dressing room between scenes, yet emerged each time {{to perform a}} flawless take. According to John Oller's biography, Jean Arthur: The Actress Nobody Knew (1997), Arthur developed a kind of stage fright <b>punctuated</b> <b>with</b> bouts of psychosomatic illnesses. A prime example was in 1945, when she was cast in {{the lead of the}} Garson Kanin play, Born Yesterday. Her nerves and insecurity got the better of her and she left the production before it reached Broadway, opening the door for a then-unknown Judy Holliday to take the part.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, Alvin Toffler in Future Shock {{described}} a trend towards accelerating rates of change. He illustrated how social and technical phenomena had shorter lifespans with each generation, and he questioned society's {{ability to cope}} with the resulting turmoil and accompanying anxiety. In past eras periods of change were always <b>punctuated</b> <b>with</b> times of stability. This allowed society to assimilate the change before the next change arrived. But these periods of stability had all but disappeared by the late 20th century. In 1980 in The Third Wave, Toffler characterized this shift to relentless change as the defining feature of the third phase of civilization (the first two phases being the agricultural and industrial waves).|$|E
25|$|From the outside, the Great Mosque of Kairouan is a fortress-like building, which {{required}} {{as much by}} its massive ocher walls of 1.90 meters thick composed of well-worked stones, courses of rubble stone and courses of baked bricks, as the square angle towers measuring 4.25 meters on each side and the solid and projecting buttresses that support and bind. More than a defensive role, the buttresses and towers full serve more to enhance {{the stability of the}} mosque built on a soil subject to compaction. Although a seemingly harsh, the external facades, <b>punctuated</b> <b>with</b> powerful buttresses and towering porches, some of which are surmounted by cupolas, give to the sanctuary a striking aspect characterized by majestic sobriety.|$|E

50|$|On November 25, 2015, Lara {{defended his}} WBA and IBO light middleweight titles against Jan Zaveck in Hialeah, Florida. On a wetted canvas due to prior heavy rain, Lara began by walking down Zaveck who was relying on wide punches. Lara {{continued}} {{to stay in}} the pocket and countered Zaveck, halting his aggression. At the end of round two, Zaveck was hurt after Lara split his jab with a clean left hand. Lara landed a straight left hand at the start of round three followed by a series of combinations <b>punctuating</b> <b>with</b> an uppercut at which point Zaveck put his hand out, turned away, and refused to continue. Zaveck appeared to be in quite a lot of pain after the fight, which was stopped 41 seconds into round three.|$|R

25|$|Ada {{tells the}} life {{story of a}} man named Van Veen, and his lifelong love affair with his sister Ada. They meet when she is eleven (soon to be twelve) and he is fourteen, believing that they are cousins (more precisely: that their fathers are cousins and that their mothers are sisters), and begin a sexual affair. They later {{discover}} that Van's father is also Ada's and her mother is also his. The story follows the various interruptions and resumptions of their affair. Both are wealthy, educated, and intelligent. Van goes on to become a world-renowned psychologist, and the book itself takes the form of his memoirs, written when he is in his nineties, <b>punctuated</b> <b>with</b> his own and Ada's marginal notes, and in parts with notes by an unnamed editor, suggesting the manuscript is not complete.|$|E
25|$|Holland {{was born}} {{the son of an}} admiral, and he {{followed}} his father into the Navy, rising through the ranks and serving on a number of ships. He was serving at the rank of lieutenant on a cruiser {{at the start of the}} First World War. He saw out the war aboard battleships in home water and the Mediterranean, <b>punctuated</b> <b>with</b> time ashore, and with a special interest in signalling and naval communications. He was promoted to lieutenant-commander after the war, and was in the Mediterranean during the Turkish War of Independence. He graduated to his own commands shortly after, commanding a cruiser on the China Station, then a destroyer in the Mediterranean. He became a naval attaché in Paris shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War, and remained in the position until April 1940.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 2002 season Dallas drafted safety Roy Williams {{with the}} 8th overall pick. The season started out low as the Cowboys {{lost to the}} {{expansion}} Houston Texans 19–10 on Week 1. By far the highlight of 2002 was on October 28, when during a home game against the Seattle Seahawks, Emmitt Smith broke the all-time NFL rushing record previously held by Walter Payton. Their Thanksgiving Day win over the Redskins was their 10th consecutive win against Washington. However, that was their final win of 2002: Dallas lost their next 4 games to finish with another last place 5–11 record. The losing streak was <b>punctuated</b> <b>with</b> a Week 17 20–14 loss against Washington. That game was Smith's last game as a Cowboys player: he was released during the offseason. Campo was immediately fired as head coach {{at the conclusion of}} the season.|$|E

40|$|Two {{new species}} of Parapharyngodon {{collected}} from the intestine of the Mexican boulder spiny lizard Sceloporus pyrocephalus are described. This study increases to 49 the number of valid species assigned to Parapharyngodon worldwide, 11 of them distributed in Mexico. Males of the two new species share the presence of four pairs of caudal papillae, an anterior echinate cloacal lip {{and the presence of}} lateral alae; however, both differ from each other in lateral alae extension and echinate cloacal anterior lip morphology. Females of both species have a prebulbar uterus and eggs shell <b>punctuate</b> <b>with</b> pores, characteristics shared with few other species of Parapharyngodon. Both new species differ from other congeneric species in the papillar arrangement, the anterior cloacal lip morphology, the lateral alae extension and total length/spicule ratio. A taxonomic key for the species of Parapharyngodon distributed in Mexico is provided...|$|R
