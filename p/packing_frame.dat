50|$|<b>Frame,</b> Field <b>Pack</b> - The field <b>pack</b> <b>frame</b> {{is used as}} a mount {{for either}} the medium field pack or the large field <b>pack.</b> The <b>frame,</b> when requisitioned, comes with all straps. The frame is of {{aluminum}} construction.|$|R
50|$|Also {{proposed}} in the letter were improved versions of the small and large field pack and field <b>pack</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|R
50|$|Field Pack (medium) - The field pack is made {{of water}} {{repellent}} treated nylon duck and webbing, spacer fabric, and metal hardware. It {{can be used with}} or without the LC-1 Field <b>Pack</b> <b>Frame.</b> The main compartment closes by means of a drawstring secured by a plastic cord clamp. A radio pocket is located against the back on the inside. The size of the pack may be decreased for smaller loads by means of three para-cord ties, stitched to the inside bottom of the pack, and three metal D-rings located directly below the internal radio pocket. Three pockets on the outside, with strap and buckle adjustable closures and with snap fasteners for quick access, are provided for miscellaneous items. The top flap has a pocket with a hook and pile fastener tape sealed closure. Equipment hangers are located above each outside pocket and on each side. Drainage eyelets are provided {{in the bottom of the}} main compartment and the outside pockets. An envelope pocket is located at the top, back of the pack and padded with spacer cloth, into which the field <b>pack</b> <b>frame</b> is inserted when the field pack is used on the field <b>pack</b> <b>frame.</b> Buckles and straps at each side near the bottom are used for anchoring the field pack to the field <b>pack</b> <b>frame.</b> Two rectangular wire loops located at the top back of the field pack and D rings on each side at the bottom of the field pack are used to provide shoulder strap attachment when the field pack is carried without the field <b>pack</b> <b>frame.</b> A waterproof bag is supplied for the main compartment and each of the three outside pockets for keeping equipment dry.|$|R
40|$|Koreans {{have devised}} what experts call the most {{effective}} carrying device in the world. This <b>pack</b> <b>frame</b> is peculiar to Korea. It enables a man to carry from two to three hundred pounds. Weight is so distributed over the hips, back, and shoulders, that maximum load can be carried with minimum effort...|$|R
25|$|External <b>frame</b> <b>packs</b> were {{designed}} to carry heavy loads (>20kg or 40lb), giving the wearer more support and protection and better weight distribution than a simple, frameless strapped bag. Wooden <b>pack</b> <b>frames</b> were used for centuries around the world. Ötzi the Iceman may have used one in Copper Age Alpine Italy, though some archaeologists believe the frame found with the body {{was part of a}} snowshoe. Such packs are common in military and mountaineering applications; metal versions first appeared in the mid-20th century.|$|R

50|$|Before {{helicopters}} {{came into}} common use for transporting the slings, they were sometimes processed {{in the bush}} and finished, hand-split, shakes were carried out in a <b>pack</b> <b>frame.</b> In steep areas, cables were strung along the slope to form a tight-line or tyrolean. Staples were driven into a block straddling the cable, and the block was slid down the cable to a landing accessible to a boat or truck.|$|R
50|$|Field Pack (large) - The {{construction}} and {{materials in the}} large field pack {{are similar to the}} medium field pack with the differences being: it is much larger in size; the center outside pocket is larger than the other two main outside pockets; and the addition of three small outside pockets above the larger pockets. The large field pack MUST be used with the LC-1 Field <b>Pack</b> <b>Frame.</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{approach}} to <b>frame</b> <b>packing</b> for multi-cluster distributed embedded systems consisting of time-triggered and event-triggered clusters, interconnected via gateways. In our approach, the application messages are <b>packed</b> into <b>frames</b> such that the application is schedulable, thus the end-to-end message communication constraints are satisfied. We have proposed a schedulability analysis for applications consisting of mixed event-triggered and time-triggered processes and messages, and a worst case queuing delay analysis for the gateways, responsible for routing inter-cluster traffic. Optimization heuristics for <b>frame</b> <b>packing</b> aiming at producing a schedulable system have been proposed. Extensive experiments and a real-life example show the efficiency of our frame-packing approach...|$|R
50|$|During 1968, the LINCLOE program {{continued}} {{to refine the}} lightweight load-carrying system. A prototype system was designed utilizing some of the existing MLCE components such as the water canteen cover, small arms ammunition cases, and field first aid dressing case. The individual equipment belt buckle was replaced with a plastic version of the Davis quick-release buckle and a new Vest, Combat was developed to replace the individual equipment belt suspenders. Teams developed both a small and large field pack utilizing the detachable field <b>pack</b> <b>frame</b> concept scrapped in 1967.|$|R

50|$|The design effort went slowly, {{due to the}} {{concentration}} on the design and development of items to meet the requirement of the Vietnam War, although developers initiated projects investigating the feasibility of replacing much of the steel and brass hardware with aluminum or plastic items. On 15 March 1967, an Engineering Concept Review was held at Natick Laboratories. The concept approved at the meeting was for an individual equipment belt to be supported by individual equipment suspenders, to which could be attached component items such as small arms ammunition cases, water canteen covers, entrenching tool carriers, field first aid dressing cases, etc. A field pack somewhat larger than the M-1961 cotton canvas duck field pack was proposed which could be attached for carrying either on the individual equipment belt at the small of the back, or on the shoulders attached to the individual equipment belt suspenders, or attached to a detachable field <b>pack</b> <b>frame.</b> The field <b>pack</b> <b>frame</b> with shoulder straps and a removable cargo shelf would be designed to be worn over the individual equipment belt and suspenders. The end result of this meeting was {{the adoption of the}} nylon M-1967 Modernized Load-Carrying Equipment (MLCE). The field pack design was rejected in the end and a nylon version of the M-1961 field pack was produced instead along with the nylon Tropical Rucksack (FSN 8465-935-6673).|$|R

In addition, the sack can often be removed entirely, permitting the user to customize the configuration of their load, or to transport a non-conventional load such as a quartered game animal. Military packs are often external frame designs due to their ability to carry loads of different shapes, sizes and weights.|$|R
25|$|Backpacks {{in general}} fall {{into one of}} four categories: frameless, {{external}} frame, internal frame, and bodypack. A <b>pack</b> <b>frame,</b> when present, serves to support the pack and distribute the weight of its contents across the body more appropriately, by transferring much of the weight to the hips and legs. Most of the weight is therefore taken off the shoulders, reducing the chance of injury from shoulder strap pressure (many backpacks equipped solely with shoulder straps can affect the posture of a person carrying more than 14kg (30lbs)), as well as being less restrictive of the upper body range of motion. Most backpacks are capable of being closed with either a buckle mechanism, a zipper, or a dry-bag type closure though a few models use a drawstring fitted with a cord lock for the main compartment.|$|R
50|$|The ZG 1229 Vampir {{weighed in}} at 2.25 {{kilograms}} (about 5 lbs.) and was fitted with lugs on the StG 44 at C.G. Haenel at Suhl, the weapons production facility. The grenadier carrying this {{was known as}} a Nachtjäger (night-hunter). As well as the sight and infrared spotlight, there was a 13.5 kilogram (about 30 lbs.) wooden cased battery for the light, and a second battery fitted inside a gas mask container to power the image converter. This was all strapped to a Tragegestell 39 (<b>pack</b> <b>frame</b> 1939). The searchlight consisted of a conventional tungsten light source shining through a filter permitting only infrared light. The sensor operated in the upper infrared (light) spectrum rather than in the lower infrared (heat) spectrum and was, therefore, not sensitive to body heat.|$|R

5000|$|The {{prototype}} Solution F/Chretien Helicopter is a coaxial rotor [...] "hang" [...] helicopter [...] Pitch {{and roll}} {{are controlled by}} weight shift. The entire rotor is tilted {{in relation to the}} suspended airframe to shift the center of gravity, thus no cyclic control is required. These features were generally implemented on the demonstrator for simplicity and expedience and were incidental to the research and demonstration goals. Yaw is controlled by differential torque applied to the two rotors. The two rotors are each driven by a separate 20 KW electric motor. Power is supplied by twenty one, 106 AH Li-ion Polymer cells with a power density of 160 WH/Kg. The unique cooling solution developed for the pack allows 500 Amps to be delivered for 10 minutes, while keeping the battery <b>pack’s</b> <b>frame</b> and cooling system down to less than 5% of the pack cell weight.|$|R
30|$|With {{such high}} loads, {{the method of}} load {{carriage}} is of major importance. For infantry, the most efficient place to carry load is on the torso {{with the use of}} a pack system [16]. In an effort to balance the moment caused by the loaded pack, soldiers will increase the forward tilt of their trunk, placing increased load on the lumbar spine [16]. Load carriage vests may be employed to lower the energetic cost, improve posture and hence lower the risk of injury by redistributing weight forwards and reducing the forward tilt [16]. Other factors related to the use of packs are the rigidity of the <b>pack</b> <b>frame</b> [36], location of load in the pack [16], terrain [16] and gender effects [16]. In questionnaires, women have been found to comment more than men about uncomfortable pack straps, poorly fitted pistol belts and unstable rucksacks, suggesting that current pack systems do not adequately cater for the differing anthropometry between the two genders [16].|$|R
50|$|During April and June 1970, teams {{fabricated}} {{a prototype}} system of load-carrying equipment {{as described in}} the 15 April 1970 letter. They presented this set of load-carrying equipment to the NCO Board and Infantry Team for review at Fort Benning on 18-19 June 1970. On 29 July 1970, representatives from the United States Army Combat Developments Command and the LINCLOE LCE Project Officer met at Natick Laboratories and drafted a revision of the LINCLOE LCE Quantitative Material Requirement as it pertained to load-carrying equipment including the characteristics for each individual item. This was based primarily on the outcome of the 17 March 1970 meeting with one major exception. The LINCLOE LCE Project Officer a third field pack to the system.

40|$|FlexRay {{is gaining}} wide {{acceptance}} {{as the next}} generation bus protocol for automotive networks. This has led to tremendous research interest in techniques for scheduling signals, which are generated by real-time applications, on the FlexRay bus. Signals are first <b>packed</b> together into <b>frames</b> at the application-level and the frames are then transmitted over the bus. To ensure reliability of frames {{in the presence of}} faults, frames must be retransmitted over the bus but this comes at the cost of higher bandwidth utilization. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel <b>frame</b> <b>packing</b> method for FlexRay bus. Our method computes the required number of retransmissions of frames that ensures the specified reliability goal. The proposed <b>frame</b> <b>packing</b> method also ensures that none of the signals violates its deadline and that the desired reliability goal for guaranteeing fault-tolerance is met at the minimum bandwidth cost. Extensive experiments on synthetic as well as a industrial case study demonstrate the benefits of our method...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—During system {{synthesis}} (e. g. task allocation) {{the transmission}} of messages between tasks is usually addressed in a simplistic way.

25|$|The {{internal}} frame backpack {{is a recent}} innovation, invented in 1967 by Greg Lowe, {{who went on to}} found Lowe Alpine and Lowepro, companies specializing in backpacks and other forms of carrying bags for various equipment. An internal-frame pack has a large fabric section around an {{internal frame}} composed of strips of either aluminum, titanium or plastic, sometimes with additional metal stays to reinforce the frame. A complex series of straps works with the frame to distribute the weight and hold it in place. The internal <b>frame</b> permits the <b>pack</b> to fit closely to the wearer's back and minimizes shifting of the load, which is desirable when participating in activities that involve upper-body movement such as scrambling over rocky surfaces and skiing. However, the tight fit reduces ventilation, so these type of packs tend to be more sweaty than external <b>frame</b> <b>packs.</b> The internal construction also allows for a large storage compartment; a few lash points (including webbing loops and straps for sleeping bags and other large items) may be present, but as the frame is completely integrated, it is difficult to securely lash larger and heavier items which do not fit inside the compartment to the outside of the <b>pack.</b> Internal <b>frame</b> <b>packs</b> originally suffered from smaller load capacity and less comfortable fit during steady walking, but newer models have improved greatly in these respects. In addition, because of their snug fit, the improved internal frame models have largely replaced external frame backpacks for many activities.|$|R
