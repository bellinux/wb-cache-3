50|$|<b>Polycide</b> is a {{silicide}} formed over polysilicon. Widely used in DRAMs. In a <b>polycide</b> MOSFET transistor process, the silicide {{is formed}} only over the polysilicon film as formation occurs prior to any polysilicon etch. <b>Polycide</b> processes contrast with salicide processes in which silicide is formed after the polysilicon etch. Thus, with a salicide process, silicide is formed over both the polysilicon gate and the exposed monocrystalline terminal {{regions of the}} transistor in a self-aligned fashion.|$|E
50|$|Also {{acquired}} with brilacidin and the HDP-mimetic pipeline {{were the}} rights to the related <b>PolyCide</b> family of compounds, polymeric formulations that function as antimicrobial agents. These compounds are similar to brilacidin in that they are also synthetic mimics of HDPs. These compounds have superior bacterial killing activity over triclosan and silver nitrate, common biocidal agents. <b>PolyCide</b> compounds could be used as additives to paints, plastics, textiles and other materials to create self-sterilizing products and surfaces.|$|E
5000|$|The term {{salicide}} {{refers to}} a technology used in the microelectronics industry used to form electrical contacts between the semiconductor device and the supporting interconnect structure. The salicide process involves the reaction of a thin metal film with silicon in the active regions of the device, ultimately forming a metal silicide contact {{through a series of}} annealing and/or etch processes. The term [...] "salicide" [...] is a compaction of the phrase self-aligned silicide. The description [...] "self-aligned" [...] suggests that the contact formation does not require lithographic patterning processes, as opposed to a non-aligned technology such as <b>polycide.</b> The term salicide is also used to refer to the metal silicide formed by the contact formation process, such as [...] "titanium salicide", although this usage is inconsistent with accepted naming conventions in chemistry.|$|E
40|$|A {{study has}} been {{performed}} to determine critical mechanisms involved in formation of nickel suicides. The process parameters under investigation were silicidation temperature, presilicide N 2 + implant, {{and the presence of}} a titanium capping layer. Contact sheet resistance phosphorous-implanted silicon was measured and determined to degrade with high silicidation temperature. Titanium capping was found to improve contact resistance and compensate for the effects of high temperature treatment for <b>polycides.</b> The nitrogen incorporation via implant shows a degradation in resistivity for both silicides and <b>polycides...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} {{in the system}} poly-Si on TiSi 2 on Si and in the <b>polycide</b> system both with CoSi 2 and TiSi 2 is investigated when subjected to furnace heat treatments at high temperature. It will be shown that the first system suffers from instability due to SPE-regrowth which is partially avoided by doping the poly-Si. The <b>polycide</b> system shows severe roughening of the TiSi 2. However, {{in the case of}} CoSi 2, the degradation is more pronounced, viz. the Co is detected all over the poly-Si layer and this can hardly be suppressed by doping of the CoSi 2 -layer...|$|E

40|$|The thermal {{stability}} of TiSi 2 /poly-Si structures with narrow lines {{has been studied}} {{as a function of}} the dopants introduced into the poly-Si (i. e., boron or arsenic) in the temperature range from 700 to 950 -degrees-C. The silicide layer was formed by rapid thermal processing (RTP) in nitrogen via a solid-solid reaction between titanium and poly-Si. The integrity, upon heat treatment, of the TiSi 2 film on large areas was investigated by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS) analysis, plan-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and cross-sectional SEM studies. Electrical information about the {{thermal stability}} of the bilayer was obtained from sheet resistance measurements on Van der Pauw structures in combination with linewidth measurements of bridge resistors with a nominal width between 0. 8 and 1. 5 -mu-m. To provide for statistical variation about one hundred measurements were collected for each linewidth and temperature setting. The results clearly show that the thermal stability of the bilayer is a function of the amount and type of dopants in the polysilicon, favoring the use of high levels of arsenic. Moreover, the thermal stability was observed to be affected by the linewidth, since at the temperature for onset of degradation (above 900 -degrees-C), narrow lines were found to disintegrate at a much higher rate than wider ones. Cross-sectional SEM and TEM micrographs of the <b>polycide</b> lines clearly reveal the TiSi 2 /poly-Si interface to suffer from bowing. The effect was observed to be more pronounced on narrow undoped and boron-doped <b>polycide</b> lines. Both the narrow line disintegration and the bowing effect of <b>polycide</b> structures can have important implications for submicron very large scale integrated (VLSI) technologies. status: publishe...|$|E
3000|$|As of now, we foresee {{two ways}} of {{improvement}} of electrical properties of the structure. The first of them consists in modification of the Schottky barrier formation process proposed in [27] which enables production of poly-Si/Ni <b>polycide</b> Schottky diodes with rectification ratios as high as 106. The other possibility is to replace poly-Si by α-Si:H and to apply the metal-induced crystallization to form diodes nearly as perfect as those produced {{on the basis of}} single-crystalline Si [8, 28 – 30].

40|$|The {{properties}} of St-rich W silicide films on P-doped poly-Si (W <b>polycide)</b> were investigated with respect o rapid anneal with halogen lamps. The outdiffusion of P, the W silicide fihn compositions, and the sheet resistivities were monitored. An 850 ~ 6 s halogen lamp annealing (HLA) caused the outdiffusion of P from the poly-Si layer {{and began to}} eliminate excess Si in W silicide film. More Si atoms were eliminated as the HLA temperature was increased. A HLA at about 1200 ~ for 6 s eliminated the excess Si and formed homogeneous stoichiometric W silicide with a smooth surface. The resistivity after a high temperature anneal was about 45 ~tl-cm and it was independent of the as-deposited W sili-cide film compositions. The P diffusivity in W silicide is reduced after a high temperature anneal. After a 1200 ~ 6 s HLA, P atoms contained in W silicide film were eliminated and the P outdiffusion from the poly-Si was almost he {{same as that of}} 1025 ~ 6 s HLA. The P outdiffusion was much smaller than that of 900 ~ 20 min furnace annealing (FA). Rapid annealing can reduce the sheet resistivity, and eliminate the excess Si and the P in the W silicide film with a lttle P outdiffusion from the poly-Si layer. From the viewpoint of the surface morphology, HLA is superior to FA {{in order to get the}} same sheet resistivity of W <b>polycide</b> films. Rapid annealing of silicide on P-doped poly-Si (poly-cide) using halogen lamps is one of the applications o...|$|E
40|$|Increases in {{component}} packing densities {{have led}} to decreasing lateral and vertical dimensions within inte-grated circuits. Reduced cross-section conductors can have unacceptably high resistances which leads to in-creased signal propagation delays. This {{is especially true for}} lower level conductors, e. g., source-drain regions and polycrystalline-silicon (poly-Si) gates and gate level inter-connections. Silicon (or poly-Si) which has been doped with materials uch as phosphorus or arsenic has a rela-tively high sheet resistance (a typical minimum for poly-Si is 20 ~/[B). Hence, various low-resistivity silicide (and poly-cide) schemes have been developed (1). The lowest resistivity silicide and <b>polycide</b> layers are generally formed by depositing a transition metal on the silicon or poly-Si. A thermal step then follows in which in...|$|E

The course teaches students analog circuit design; an external manufacturer then produces their designs in three different silicon chips.

40|$|The {{advent of}} very large scale {{integration}} will require substantial progress {{in all aspects}} of silicon technology: processing, lithography, modeling, design tools, chip architecture, and applications This paper will survey current trends in silicon integrated circuit fabrication, focusing on new developments and outstanding problems. Progress in both bipolar and MOSFET technologies will be considered. Silicon fabrication techniques will be described in terms of the repetitious application of operations that are additive (oxidation, doping, deposition), selective (lithography), and subtractive (etching). The objective of these operations is a reliable and predictable device structure. Device structures will be described in terms of isolation areas, devices, contacts (intraconnection vias), wiring (interconnection lines), and passivation. Immediate problems in isolation size, device performance, contact resistance, and wiring topography will be identified. Future needs for improved structures will be indicated. Promising new approaches such as lightly-doped drain FETs and silicide-on-polysilicon (<b>polycide)</b> wiring will be described.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of utilizing NF 3 -mixed halocarbon etchants to anisotropically etch tungsten <b>polycide</b> structures has been investigated. Chemical vapor deposited tungsten silicide and low-pressure chemical vapor deposited polysilicon have been etched using various mixtures of CF 3 C 1, CF 2 C 12, and CF 3 Br with NF~. Anisotropy, undercutting, and notching were evaluated using cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy. Etch rates and profiles were controlled by utilizing halocarbon-rich (> 50 %) binary halocarbon etchants. The etch rate {{data indicate that}} the volatility of the tungsten halide formed during etching influences the silicide etch rate and profile while the polymer forming ability of the halocarbon controls the etch characteristics of the polysilicon. Background Refractory metals, such as tungsten and molybdenum, and their silicides have attracted considerable attention as materials for high-density, high-speed integrated circuits (ICs).

40|$|Suicides {{have been}} used in {{industry}} since minimum dimensions reached the 1 ~tm node. The goal of this project is to explore Titanium and Cobalt Silicide and incorporate its use into the JUT sub-micron CMOS process. TiSi 2 had been the industry standard to decrease this resistivity through the 0. 25 μm node. The current industry standard is CoSi 2, with resistivity independent of its grain size. This allows for the smaller dimensions. However, CoSi 2 formation is very sensitive to oxygen contamination. A Ti capping layer may minimize the contamination by reacting with any oxygen. The nitrogen implant prior to metal deposition should suppress agglomeration in the films and improve thermal stability. A Transmission Line Model (TLM) structure has been used to extract specific contact resistivity and contact resistance for the suicide. Four point probing will measure the resistivity of the <b>polycide.</b> Results show a reduction in sheet resistance of polysilicon samples after silicidation.

40|$|Bilayer {{structures}} of TaSi 2 and poly-Si have been patterned with good resolution using either an SIC 14 or an HC 1 plasma. End-point detection and diagnostics {{were carried out}} by optical emission spectroscopy, laser reflectometry, and mass spectrometry. Either an oxygen plasma or Caro's acid were used for resist stripping. Structures that had apparently been cleanly stripped were etched in SF 8 to remove the remaining TaSi 2 and St. Residues remaining after this treatment provide strong evidence for a sidewall protection mechanism of anisotropic etching. The sheet resistivity of p lysilicon used for the gate elec-trode in MOS circuits imposes a limit on the high-speed performance oflogic and memory devices. A bilayer struc-ture of a transition metal silicide on top of polycrystalline silicon (<b>polycide)</b> has a lower resistivity and offers a useful alternative (1). Since the gate dimensions for such circuits are 2 ~m and below, good profile control of the etched structures is needed.

40|$|Abstract—A new ESD {{protection}} {{design by}} using the well-coupled field-oxide device (WCFOD) is pro-posed to protect the slew-rate-controlled output buer in a 0. 5 mm P-well/N-substrate CMOS SRAM technology. The ESD transient voltage is coupled to the P-well of the ESD protection field-oxide device through a parasitic capacitor to trigger on the bipolar action of the field-oxide device. The ESD trigger voltage of the WCFOD can be lowered to below the snapback-breakdown voltage of the output NMOS transistor, so it provides eective ESD protection for the slew-rate-controlled output transistors without causing any degradation on the circuit performance. The coupling capacitor is made by insert-ing a poly layer right under the wire-bonding metal pad without the increase of layout area. A modified WCFOD structure is also proposed for output ESD protection in deep-submicron CMOS technology with <b>polycide</b> or salicide processes. Three conventional output ESD protection designs with the series resistor, the double-diode structure, and the field-oxide device, are also made for comparison. Five test chips with the same 256 K SRAM core but only dierent output ESD protection designs have been fab-ricated in a same wafer to practically verify the ESD protection eciency of this proposed WCFO...|$|E
40|$|Low {{pressure}} chemically vapor deposited polysilicon deposition was studied from 525 to 650 ~ The silicon {{appears to}} be amorphous with a smooth surface up to 550 ~ and completely crystalline above 600 ~ The transition region {{is found to be}} from 560 to 590 ~ This transition is marked by sharp crystallographic and resistivity changes. The smooth surface morphology of the amorphous silicon is found to be preserved after POC 13 doping and a 1000 ~ oxidation. The preservation of this smooth morphology is demonstrated to be due to the presence of a native oxide {{on the surface of the}} silicon upon exposure to atmosphere. However, an in situ anneal of amorphous silicon at 610 ~ results in large coarse crystals with rough surface morphology and disparate orientation. The smooth morphology of the 550 ~ silicon is found to be transmitted through subsequent <b>polycide</b> structure layers. The impact on device reliability is discussed. The amorphous silicon is found to have a higher plasma etch rate than the polysilicon. Doped polysilicon is widely used in very large scale inte-grated (VLSI) device fabrication as gate electrodes, inter-connect material, and as resistors in static memory circuits. As gate electrodes, the surface morphology is an important factor in device reliability, as the presence of asperities o...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—To provide area-ecient output ESD {{protection}} for the scaled-down CMOS VLSI, a new output ESD protection is proposed. In the new output ESD protection circuit, there are two novel devices, the PTLSCR (PMOS-trigger lateral SCR) and the NTLSCR (NMOS-trigger lateral SCR). The PTLSCR is in parallel and merged with the output PMOS, and the NTLSCR is in parallel and merged with the output NMOS, to provide area-ecient ESD {{protection for}} CMOS output buers. The trigger voltages of PTLSCR and NTLSCR are lowered below the breakdown voltages of the output PMOS and NMOS in the CMOS output buer. The PTLSCR and NTLSCR are guaranteed to be turned on first before the output PMOS or NMOS are broken down by the ESD voltage. Experimental results {{have shown that the}} PTLSCR and NTLSCR can sustain over 4000 V (700 V) of the human-body-model (machine-model) ESD stresses within a very small layout area in a 0. 6 mm CMOS technology with LDD and <b>polycide</b> processes. The noise margin of the proposed output ESD protection design is greater than 8 V (lower than ÿ 3. 3 V) to avoid the undesired triggering on the NTLSCR (PTLSCR) due to the overshooting (undershooting) voltage pulse on the output pad when the IC is under normal oper...|$|E
40|$|Silicon Carbide {{with its}} wide bandgap, high thermal conductivity, and high {{breakdown}} electric field {{is an attractive}} material {{to be used for}} applications in high power, and high temperature semiconductor devices. For such applications, it is extremely important to be able to form stable ohmic contacts. Various metals have been attempted to form ohmic contacts on SiC such as Ni, Ti, and Al. However it has been observed that these metallization schemes have degraded performance due to carbon accumulation by forming carbides at the interface. In this study, <b>polycide</b> (poly Si + silicide) based metallizations have been investigated, using NiSi 2 and TiSi 2. Silicides of Ni and Ti have been synthesized employing a layer of heavily doped polysilicon to prevent any form of reaction between the metal and the carbon at the SiC interface. Using a 0. 5 cm 2 n-type 6 H-SiC samples with various doping concentrations (1. 3 x 1018 cm- 3 and 1. 7 x 1018 cm- 3), the electrical and structural properties of NiSi 2 and TiSi 2 have been examined by fabricating linear transmission line model (TLM) structures.

40|$|Biofilms are slimy {{aggregates}} of microbes {{that are}} likely responsible for many chronic infections {{as well as for}} contamination of clinical and industrial environments. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a prevalent hospital pathogen that is well known for its ability to form biofilms that are recalcitrant to many different antimicrobial treatments. We have devised a high-throughput method for testing combinations of antimicrobials for synergistic activity against biofilms, including those formed by P. aeruginosa. This approach was used to look for changes in biofilm susceptibility to various biocides when these agents were combined with metal ions. This process identified that Cu 2 + works synergistically with quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs; specifically benzalkonium chloride, cetalkonium chloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, myristalkonium chloride, and <b>Polycide)</b> to kill P. aeruginosa biofilms. In some cases, adding Cu 2 + to QACs resulted in a 128 -fold decrease in the biofilm minimum bactericidal concentration compared to that for single-agent treatments. In combination, these agents retained broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity that also eradicated biofilms of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica serovar Cholerasuis, and Pseudomonas fluorescens. To investigate the mechanism of action, isothermal titration calorimetry was used to show that Cu 2 + and QACs do not interact in aqueous solutions, suggesting that each agent exerts microbiological toxicity through independent biochemical routes. Additionally, Cu 2 + and QACs, both alone and in combination, reduced the activity of nitrate reductases, which are enzymes that are important for normal biofilm growth. Collectively, {{the results of this study}} indicate that Cu 2 + and QACs are effective combinations of antimicrobials that may be used to kill bacterial biofilms...|$|E
40|$|Two I. C. {{fabrication}} process steps and {{the extraction of}} simulation model parameters for them are investigated. Plasma etching of tantalum <b>polycide</b> using chlorinated freons and sulfur hexaflouride is studied. It is shown that nearly vertical gate structures are achieved using these gasses, {{without the need for}} chlorine gas. Photoresist dissolution is also studied. A suite of software, PAREX, has been written which allows the automatic extraction of model parameters from experimental data gathered on a Perkin-Elmer Development Rate Monitor. An example using Kodak 820 photoresist developed in Kodak 809 is given, and the derived parameters are compared to previous characterization values. Lower values are found for high exposures, likely due to the lower level of agitation in the developer bath than in the previous measurement system. In addition, the surface retardation effect is much more difficult to extract due to noise in the data and {{it does not seem to}} be as pronounced possibly due to the lower level of agitation and to noise in the experimental data.
