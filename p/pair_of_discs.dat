50|$|Representative are low-torque {{synchronous}} motors with a multi-pole {{hollow cylindrical}} magnet (internal poles) surrounding the stator structure. An aluminum cup supports the magnet. The stator has one coil, coaxial with the shaft. At {{each end of}} the coil are a pair of circular plates with rectangular teeth on their edges, formed so they are parallel with the shaft. They are the stator poles. One of the <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>discs</b> distributes the coil's flux directly, while the other receives flux that has passed through a common shading coil. The poles are rather narrow, and between the poles leading {{from one end of the}} coil are an identical set leading from the other end. In all, this creates a repeating sequence of four poles, unshaded alternating with shaded, that creates a circumferential traveling field to which the rotor's magnetic poles rapidly synchronize. Some stepping motors have a similar structure.|$|E

50|$|From {{high density}} storage or from slusher/pulper the pulp is pumped {{to a low}} density storage chest (tank). From there it is {{typically}} diluted to about 4% consistency before being pumped to an unrefined stock chest. From the unrefined stock chest stock is again pumped, with consistency control, through a refiner. Refining is an operation whereby the pulp slurry passes between a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>discs,</b> {{one of which is}} stationary and the other rotating at speeds of typically 1,000 or 1,200 RPM for 50 and 60 Hz AC, respectively. The discs have raised bars on their faces and pass each other with narrow clearance. This action unravels the outer layer of the fibres, causing the fibrils of the fibres to partially detach and bloom outward, increasing the surface area to promoting bonding. Refining thus increases tensile strength. For example, tissue paper is relatively unrefined whereas packaging paper is more highly refined. Refined stock from the refiner then goes to a refined stock chest, or blend chest, if used as such.|$|E

40|$|SummaryPerceiving {{which of}} a scene's objects are {{adjacent}} may require selecting {{them with a}} limited-capacity attentional process. Previous results support this notion [1 – 3] but leave open whether the process operates simultaneously on several objects or proceeds one by one. With arrays of colored discs moving together, we first tested the effect of moving the discs faster than the speed limit for following them with attentional selection [4]. At these high speeds, participants could identify which colors were present and determine whether identical arrays were aligned or offset by one disc. They could not, however, apprehend which colors in the arrays were adjacent, indicating that attentional selection is required for this judgment. If selection operates serially to determine which colors are neighbors, then after the color of one disc is identified, attention must shift to the adjacent disc. As {{a result of the}} motion, attention might occasionally miss its target and land on the trailing disc. We cued attention to first select {{one or the other of}} a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>discs</b> and found the pattern of errors predicted. Perceiving these spatial relationships evidently requires selecting and processing objects one by one and is only possible at low object speeds...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe surface {{roughness}} evolution in lubricated contacts {{is a crucial}} step in the fatigue prediction process. The latter is initially conditioned by the running in process and finally by surface fatigue. This work aims at understanding and predicting rolling contact fatigue with a particular emphasis on the very first cycles. It {{is based on a}} combined experimental and numerical approach. The current paper is centred on the experimental description. A major difficulty in understanding surface degradation is the measurement of the {{surface roughness}} evolution at the relevant scales. In fact, current twin disc machines allow a global study of the contact behaviour (normal and tangential load) but it is necessary to dismount the system for each roughness measurement. Furthermore, the duration and costs are important as each <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>discs</b> provides only a single surface observation ({{at the end of the}} test). A twin disc micro-machine, called μMag, developed at the LaMCoS laboratory, was specially designed for this kind of surface roughness analysis. The μMag allows the observation in situ of the disc surface during the test interruption. This avoids dismounting discs, a major cause of perturbations and inaccuracies. This test system offers an accurate and continuous control of the kinematics and load parameters. At each test interruption, the surface topography is measured using an optical profiler. Marks on the surface allow very accurate relocalisation of the same profile. This is essential to follow the running in mechanism and for efficient numerical simulations. Contact stress calculations are performed using analytical [1] and numerical [2] tools. The crowned disc is turned, with a roughness of 0. 6 μm. The cylindrical disc is honed, its roughness is less than 0. 01 μm, therefore the cylindrical disc is called the smooth disc. The first results obtained with the μMaG apparatus are presented in this paper. The surface geometry is observed at the end of the first, fifth and tenth cycle. The steady state of the surface deformation is obtained after few cycles and marks to the end of the running in period. An FFT based simulation of the experiments is carried out using the actual initial surface topography of both discs. The elastoplastic model developed by Mayeur et al. [3] was used with a bi linear constitutive law. The experimental surface topography at the end of the running in period is compared with the numerical results. This procedure is repeated up to 1 Million cycles leading to surface crack initiation...|$|E

40|$|AbstractFretting is a {{phenomenon}} occurring between two surfaces having relative oscillatory motion of small amplitude. Fretting damage occurs on the surfaces of contacting components. An accurate assessment of critical fretting variables such as contact traction, contact condition (stick & slip) and contact stresses over the blade-disc attachment is essential to characterize the fretting performance and to assess the reliability of rotor. Such an understanding helps {{in the design of}} lighter engines, with better performance and improved safety. Rotor consists of a number <b>of</b> contact <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>disc</b> and blade, it would be complex to study all the interfaces together. Hence a simplified approach of studying a single lobe of a dovetail interface for a sector is considered to understand the fretting behavior of fan and compressor blade-disc interface.
