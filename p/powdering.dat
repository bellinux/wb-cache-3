5|$|Medicinal {{plants are}} often tough and fibrous, {{requiring}} {{some form of}} preparation to make them convenient to administer. According to the Institute for Traditional Medicine, common methods for the preparation of herbal medicines include decoction, <b>powdering,</b> and extraction with alcohol, in each case yielding a mixture of substances. Decoction involves crushing and then boiling the plant material in water to produce a liquid extract. <b>Powdering</b> involves drying the plant material and then crushing it to yield a powder that can be compressed into tablets. Alcohol extraction involves soaking the plant material in cold wine or distilled spirit to form a tincture.|$|E

Her husband covers her with a white sheet as a priest prays. Madonna, wearing a long, black coat, sings the song underneath a snow-covered, dead tree, as the young girl plays with her dead mother's jewelry. The husband comes and shouts at the girl, tearing away the woman's pearl necklace which drop at the little girl's feet. The adult Madonna is shown lying beside another man singing the song as the little girl visits her mother's grave. The man gets up and slaps Madonna in the face, as the little girl cries in front of the grave. She is taken away from the graveyard by her father, as interspersed scenes show the girl being kissed by her mother, her trying to reach the knob of a door, and Madonna <b>powdering</b> the bruise mark on her face.|$|E

Lead could be added directly to a ceramic body {{in the form of}} a lead compound in suspension, either from galena (PbS), red lead (Pb3O4), white lead (2PbCO3·Pb(OH)2), or lead oxide (PbO). The second method involves mixing the lead compound with silica, which is then placed in suspension and applied directly. The third method involves fritting the lead compound with silica, <b>powdering</b> the mixture, and suspending and applying it. The method used on a particular vessel may be deduced by analysing the interaction layer between the glaze and the ceramic body microscopically.|$|E

500|$|The {{flesh is}} mostly whitish or {{yellowish}} in some places; underneath the cap cuticle, it is brownish-pink or reddish brown. Initially firm, {{it begins to}} soften under the cap in older mushrooms. In {{some parts of the}} cap, such as the junction of the cap and the stipe, the flesh stains pale blue when injured or exposed to air, particularly in damp weather. This change is sometimes faint, and not persistent, as it eventually reverts to its original colour. The stipe is [...] long by [...] thick, and is similar in colour to the cap but paler, and sometimes with a rose-coloured tinge. Its surface has faint longitudinal ridges, a fine <b>powdering,</b> and fine reticulations (a net-like pattern of ridges) at the apex. It often has a whitish region at the base and the top, and white mycelium at the base. Unlike the bulbous stipe of many other boletes, the stipe of B. badius remains relatively slim and cylindrical. The flesh of the stipe gets tougher with age. Its smell has been described as fruity.|$|E

2500|$|Chahut was {{exhibited}} at the Salon des Indépendants, 20 March–27 April 1890, eclipsing his other large entry: Jeune femme se poudrant (Young Woman <b>Powdering</b> Herself), to which critics at the time paid little attention. Chahut, the larger and more progressively modern of the two, was widely discussed among Symbolist critics, such as Arsène Alexandre, Jules Christophe, Gustave Kahn, , Henry van de Velde, Emile Verhaeren, and Téodor de Wyzewa. Two themes stood out: the Montmartre subject matter, and its incarnation of Henry's theories of linear expression. The painting was not liberally praised, as critics perceived its linear composition as overly schematic. Yet due to Chahut's anti-naturalist elements, its hieratic formalism and ritualistic components, Seurat were seen as an innovator. Their interpretations unintentionally paralleled the terms and concepts of Charles Blanc, whose anti-naturalist approach continued to inspire Seurat. Blanc commented on Egyptian art with a syntax the Symbolists may have used for Chahut: ...|$|E

50|$|Face <b>powder</b> is a {{cosmetic}} <b>powder</b> {{applied to the}} face to set a foundation after application.

Besides toning the face, some <b>powders</b> with sunscreen can also reduce skin damage from sunlight and environmental stress. It comes packaged either as a compact or as loose <b>powder.</b> It can be applied with a sponge, brush, or <b>powder</b> puff. Uniform distribution over the face is achieved more easily when a loose <b>powder</b> is applied.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} master thesis {{project was}} to {{statistically}} correlate various <b>powder</b> characteristics {{to the quality of}} additively manufactured parts. An additional goal of this project was to find a potential second source supplier of <b>powder</b> for GKN Aerospace Sweden in Trollhättan. Five Inconel® alloy 718 <b>powders</b> from four individual <b>powder</b> suppliers have been analyzed in this project regarding <b>powder</b> characteristics such as: morphology, porosity, size distribution, flowability and bulk properties. One <b>powder</b> out of the five, <b>Powder</b> C, is currently used in production at GKN and functions as a reference. The five <b>powders</b> were additively manufactured by the process of laser metal deposition according to a pre-programmed model utilized at GKN Aerospace Sweden in Trollhättan. Five plates were produced per <b>powder</b> and each cut to obtain three area sections to analyze, giving a total of fifteen area sections per <b>powder.</b> The quality of deposited parts was assessed by means of their porosity content, <b>powder</b> efficiency, geometry and microstructure. The final step was to statistically evaluate the results through the analysis methods of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and simple linear regression with the software Minitab. The method of ANOVA found a statistical significant difference between the five <b>powders</b> regarding their experimental results. This made it possible to compare the five <b>powders</b> against each other. Statistical correlations by simple linear regression analysis were found between various <b>powder</b> characteristics and quality of deposited part. This led to the conclusion that GKN should consider additions to current <b>powder</b> material specification by <b>powder</b> characteristics such as: particle morphology, <b>powder</b> porosity and flowability measurements by a rheometer. One <b>powder</b> was found to have the potential of becoming a second source supplier to GKN, namely <b>Powder</b> A. <b>Powder</b> A had overall good <b>powder</b> properties such as smooth and spherical particles, high particle density at 99, 94 % and good flowability.
