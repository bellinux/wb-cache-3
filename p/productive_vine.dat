5000|$|Vranac (...) , Montenegrin and Вранац) is {{a variety}} of grapes and a red wine from Montenegro. It is {{protected}} as intellectual property and Montenegrin geographical indication of origin since 1977. Vranac is considered the most important variety of grape in Montenegro {{and one of the}} most important in the Republic of Macedonia (where it is known as Vranec). As it is a local specialty and due to its localized geography, it produces a dry red wine of a unique taste and character that is synonymous with the Balkans. Vranac berries are large and deeply colored, with its dark berries growing on moderately vigorous and very <b>productive</b> <b>vines.</b> The fruit is harvested by hand. Depending on the area, this harvest can begin from mid-September and continue into October.|$|R

50|$|While {{classified}} as a white grape varieties and only used to produce white wines, clusters of Aurore blanc often will have a pink tinge to them (similar to Pinot gris and Gewürztraminer though not as dark as those two varieties can be). Aurore {{is known to be}} a very vigorous and <b>productive</b> <b>vine,</b> capable of producing high yields and expansive foliage if not kept in check with winter pruning and summer leaf-pulling. It is a very early ripening variety, coming to full ripeness even before varieties such as Chasselas in cold climates.|$|E
40|$|Beginning in 1997, {{international}} {{prices for}} black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) boomed {{for about three}} years, coinciding with the Asian economic crisis. Smallholders throughout Southeast Asia responded to the price rises by investing more labor into existing pepper gardens as well as planting new gardens. While {{this is part of}} an old pattern with such boom-and-bust cash crops, the unique historical circumstance surrounding the most recent boom was the Asian crisis. Here we compare the response of Iban pepper smallholders to this situation {{on either side of the}} international border separating Sarawak, Malaysia and West Kalimantan, Indonesia. On both sides, Iban benefited from the higher prices, but many households without <b>productive</b> <b>vines</b> at the onset of high prices were too late as their new gardens had hardly matured before prices fell in 2000. In the study communities, the Iban Kalimantan significantly reduced their labor migration to focus on pepper during the period of high prices, whereas the Sarawak Iban relied on rather specific off-farm income sources in the tourism, off-shore oil and gas industries, and did not significantly alter their pepper cultivation strategies. The mutual buffering capacity of hill rice cultivation and pepper farming described in an earlier study in Sarawak was not evident in the study communities...|$|R
40|$|The {{agriculture}} in Czech republic belongs to traditional {{parts of a}} national economy and this topic is very discussed recently especially after the admission Czech republic to European Union. Czech farmers and wine producers {{do not have the}} same conditions as wine producers in the original countries of European Union. The winery has a big value for czech agriculture especially in the production areas. There is a characteristic of basic notions, definitions and surveyed variables in the theory part. Furthermore there is a description of importance of vinery to national economy and to the production areas. In the analytical part there will be the estimation of a production of wine, changes of <b>productive</b> surface and <b>vine</b> varieties. The intenstion of this thesis is to create the compact analytic material about the wine production from 1945 to present days...|$|R
40|$|SMARTVINO {{project is}} devoted to the study and {{implementation}} of innovative services able to convey information related to wine and its traceability to costumers and consumers. The basic idea is to realize a simple and user-friendly tool, addressed to all kind of users and therefore immediately effective for everyone. SMARTVINO system allows users to take a photo of the previously marked company logo, depicted on the wine label, by a ordinarily known smartphone and then redirected to lots of detailed information related to the wine they are buying or drinking. Contents can concern the <b>productive</b> process, the <b>vine</b> variety the wine is made by, the geo-spatial localization of the vineyards, recommendations about which course is the most appropriate to be coupled with the wine, etc; in general, all the information or suggestions the producing winery wants to share with its customers. Such information can be in form of text, images, videos and web pages. The project is still on-going at the date of writing. Next activities will be dedicated to draft a detailed plan for the commercial use of results. This paper {{is devoted to}} present the outcomes of the project and how these can be exploited in wine scenario...|$|R
5000|$|Cascade is a Seibel grape being {{produced}} from a crossing of Seibel 7042 and Gloire de Seibel by the French viticulturist Albert Seibel {{in the early}} 1930s. The variety was first released for commercial production in 1938. Known originally as Seibel 13053, the grape was given the name [...] "Cascade" [...] by the Finger Lakes Wine Growers Association in 1970. The exact reasoning behind the name is unclear with some winegrowers speculating that the name came from {{the way that the}} highly <b>productive</b> <b>vine</b> would have fruit [...] "cascading off the vine" [...] like a waterfall even from water sprouts and suckers.|$|E
50|$|Freisa {{is a red}} Italian {{wine grape}} variety grown in the Piedmont region of north-west Italy, {{primarily}} in Monferrato and in the Langhe, but also further north in the provinces of Turin and Biella. Freisa is a vigorous and <b>productive</b> <b>vine</b> whose round, blue-black grapes are harvested in early October. The three-lobed leaves are relatively small and the bunches are elongated in form. By the 1880s it {{had become one of}} the major Piedmontese grapes, and in that period its cultivation was stimulated by the vine’s resistance to the downy mildew caused by the Plasmopara viticola fungus. Wines made from the Freisa grape are red and usually somewhat sweet and lightly sparkling, or foaming. Still and fully sparkling versions are also produced, however, as are dry and more decidedly sweet styles. In the Canavese there is also a rosé which can be made primarily from Freisa according to Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) regulations.|$|E
40|$|Kiwifruit {{breeding}} programmes in New Zealand {{have produced a}} large number of seedling populations. Effective methods are required to assess seedlings, and knowledge of phenotypic and genotypic variation would facilitate the design of {{breeding programmes}}. 1. Multivariate analyses of phenotypic data Multivariate analyses were used to quantify the characters most powerful in distinguishing between seedlings and between crosses, and to examine their relationships. Seedlings and crosses were placed in order of their overall merit, and the best ones were determined. Bruno was a superior female parent for producing both floriferous male <b>vines</b> and <b>productive</b> female <b>vines</b> with high fruit vitamin C content, and D 1 - 20 was the better male parent in all crosses. Multivariate analysis of variance and discriminant analysis were more suitable to sort cross combinations, while factor analysis was more efficient for screening single seedlings within a population. Factor patterns varied between crosses, and between years for the same cross. Canonical correlation analysis proved a useful tool to obtain better understanding of the aggregates of useful vine characters and the relationship between them in fruit breeding. 2. Quantitative genetics studies Relatively high heritability was shown for the beginning date of bloom (0. 48) and flowering duration (0. 50) in male vines, and total crop weight (0. 46), percentage of shoots flowering (0. 54), fruit elongation (0. 65), and mean fruit weight (0. 52) in female vines. For these traits, the selection of superior seedlings as parent could therefore lead to rapid genetic improvement to their subsequent generations. Hairiness of fruit (- 0. 07) and percentage soluble solids in fruit (- 0. 19) gave negative heritability value, thus could not be improved efficiently by individual selection. However, their broad sense heritability was reasonably high (0. 22 and 0. 37 respectively), showing there were some dominant and/or epistatic effects involved. This indicates a possible chance improvement may occur in a large seedling population. Fruit vitamin C content (0. 22), fruit symmetry (0. 30) and relative core size (0. 13) gave moderate or low heritability values, indicating that individual selection may have only moderate success in improving these traits. Simple recurrent individual selection was shown to be an effective breeding strategy for characters of high heritability. For characters of low heritability, the family selection methods yielded a greater rate of genetic gain. Selection indices were constructed to provide a technique for improving several traits simultaneously. 3. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of leaf proteins Three regions of the protein profile were found useful for the characterisation of cultivars and seedlings. The banding patterns found in seedlings provided evidence that in the hexaploid kiwifruit the inheritance of these polypeptides occurred {{in a manner similar to}} that of a diploid. Hence the kiwifruit may have arisen as a diploidized polyploid and it is proposed the kiwifruit may be considered as allohexaploid. Progressive changes of some bands with leaf growth and development may be of interest in the study of leaf development. The possible application of leaf protein analysis to kiwifruit breeding was discussed...|$|R
