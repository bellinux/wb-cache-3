50|$|The {{early days}} of flight proved quite {{difficult}} for air-to-ground communication. Ground crews would rely on colored paddles, and hand signs and other visual aids. This was effective for ground crews, but it offered no way for pilots to communicate back. In the beginning of World War I planes were not outfitted with radios, so soldiers used large <b>panel</b> <b>cut</b> outs to distinguish friendly forces. These cut outs {{could also be used}} as a directional device to help pilots navigate back to friendly airfields.|$|E
50|$|Nonetheless, {{wireless}} communication systems in aircraft remained experimental and would {{take years to}} successfully develop a practical prototype. The early radios were heavy in weight and were considered an unreliable piece of equipment; additionally there were still major issues with ground forces using radio because signals were easily intercepted and targeted by opposing forces. At the beginning of World War I, aircraft were not typically equipped with wireless equipment. Instead, soldiers used large <b>panel</b> <b>cut</b> outs to distinguish friendly forces. These cut outs {{could also be used}} as a directional device to help pilots navigate back to friendly and familiar airfields.|$|E

40|$|For {{design of}} {{stiffened}} composite shells, for example aircraft fuselage, {{it is important}} to know actual laminated composite properties. Conventional way is testing the coupon specimens, which are manufactured with similar technology as the real large structure. Employing such method still is open the question, whether the material properties obtained from the coupon tests are the same as in the large structure. In the present paper comparative study of three methods is performed. Material properties of laminated carbon/epoxy composite were obtained from conventional static tests, from vibration tests of the flat plates and from vibration tests of the small panel with one stiffener. The small panel was cut from the large stiffened composite panel, which before was tested for post-buckling. The method of identification is based on solution of inverse problem. For this experimental and numerical frequencies are employed in identification functional, which is defined as squared discrepancies between the measured and numerical frequencies. Approximation of the functional was obtained using method of experimental design and response surface approach [1, 2]. The results for elastic properties obtained employing the first (static tests of coupons) and second (vibration tests of flat plates) method are in good agreement. The results obtained from the vibration tests of the small <b>panel</b> <b>cut</b> from the real structure are with some differences. This can be explained so, that single ply thickness, material density, layer angles of the real structure is slightly different from the nominal values. These differences should be taken into account in design of real structures by choosing safety factors, calculating the limit and the collapse loads of composite stiffened structures...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{gives the}} results of a series of shear tests carried out on {{historic}} wall panels reinforced with an innovative technique by means of jacketing with GFRP (Glass Fiber Reinforced Plastics) mesh inserted into an inorganic matrix. Tests were carried out in situ on <b>panels</b> <b>cut</b> from three different historic buildings in Italy: two in double-leaf rough hewn rubble stone masonry in Umbria and L’Aquila and another with solid brick masonry in Emilia. Two widely-known test methods: the diagonal compression test and the shear-compression test with existing confinement stress. The test results enabled the determination of the shear strength of the masonry before and after the application of the reinforcement. The panels strengthened with the GFRP exhibited a significant improvement in lateral load-carrying capacity of up to 1060 % when compared to the control panels. A numerical study assessed the global behavior and the stress evolution in the unreinforced and strengthened panels using a finite element code...|$|R

40|$|Fabric {{structures}} demonstrate {{an enormous}} application potential of tensioned fabric {{as a medium}} for creating dramatic looking, ‘free‐form’ architectural enclosures. However, their design presents a number of challenges. Firstly, their shape cannot be known accurately at the outset; {{it has to be}} found through a process of form‐finding. Secondly, under imposed loading (wind or snow), they exhibit a visible form‐force interaction, which has {{to be taken into account}} at the load analysis stage. Finally, the manufacture of a 3 ‐dimensional fabric surface has to involve a patterning stage, which maps the surface onto a series of 2 ‐dimensional <b>panels</b> <b>cut</b> in unstrained fabric. As discussed in this paper, all of the design stages require specialist computational modelling based on good understanding of the relationship between form and stress. Much of the discussion in the paper centres on misconceptions associated with form‐finding, as well as the inadequacies of some computational approaches to form‐finding and patterning. The question of what constitutes an optimal form points to the use of natural principles in the conceptual design of fabric structures...|$|R

50|$|Kubo has cited {{influences}} for {{elements of}} Bleach ranging from other manga series to music, foreign language, architecture, and film. He attributes {{his interest in}} drawing the supernatural and monsters to Shigeru Mizuki's GeGeGe no Kitaro and Bleachs focus on interesting weaponry and battle scenes to Masami Kurumada's Saint Seiya, manga that Kubo enjoyed as a boy. The action style and storytelling found in Bleach are inspired by cinema, though Kubo has not revealed any specific movie as being an influence for fight scenes. When pressed, he told interviewers that he liked Snatch but did not {{use it as a}} model. Kubo has also stated that he wishes to make Bleach an experience that can only be found by reading manga, and dismissed ideas of creating any live-action film adaptations of the series. Bleachs fight choreography is instead constructed with the aid of rock music, which the author listens to while imagining the fights in order to give him a sense of pacing for the <b>panel</b> <b>cuts</b> and change of angles through the scenes. Kubo prefers to draw realistic injuries in order to render the fight more impactful, by making the readers feel the pain the characters are feeling.
