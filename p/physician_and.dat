40|$|Objective To {{determine}} why <b>physicians</b> <b>and</b> midlevel providers join, leave, or stay in Navajo Area Indian Health Service (IHS). Design Cross-sectional {{analysis of}} data obtained from questionnaires. Setting Navajo Area IHS hospitals. Subjects Navajo Area health care <b>physicians</b> <b>and</b> midlevel health care providers. Main outcome measures The prevalence of <b>physicians</b> <b>and</b> midlevel providers who plan to leave the Navajo Area IHS, the demographic characteristics of these <b>physicians</b> <b>and</b> midlevel providers, and the most common reasons for staying or leaving. Results A total of 221 (64 %) <b>physicians</b> <b>and</b> midlevel providers responded. Of these, 58 % planned to leave eventually, and 47 % of all <b>physicians</b> <b>and</b> midlevel providers planned to leave in the next 3 years. <b>Physicians</b> <b>and</b> midlevel providers planning to leave tended to be younger than those planning to stay (P = 0. 009). The most common reason to join the IHS was a desire {{to work in the}} Southwest, to stay was the quality of the medical staff, and to leave was lack of administrative support. Conclusions A high turnover rate of <b>physicians</b> <b>and</b> midlevel providers may occur in the next 3 years. A combination of factors specific to the provider, the institution, and the environment attracts physicians to the Navajo IHS and encourages them to stay. Factors that push <b>physicians</b> <b>and</b> midlevel providers to leave tend to be specific to the institution and are potentially amenable...|$|R
