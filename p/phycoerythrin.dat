25|$|As {{mentioned}} in the industrial applications section above, lanthanide metals are particularly useful in technologies that {{take advantage of their}} reactivity to specific wavelengths of light. Certain life science applications take advantage of the unique luminescence properties of lanthanide ion complexes (Ln(III) chelates or cryptates). These are well-suited for this application due to their large Stokes shifts and extremely long emission lifetimes (from microseconds to milliseconds) compared to more traditional fluorophores (e.g., fluorescein, allophycocyanin, <b>phycoerythrin,</b> and rhodamine). The biological fluids or serum commonly used in these research applications contain many compounds and proteins which are naturally fluorescent. Therefore, the use of conventional, steady-state fluorescence measurement presents serious limitations in assay sensitivity. Long-lived fluorophores, such as lanthanides, combined with time-resolved detection (a delay between excitation and emission detection) minimizes prompt fluorescence interference.|$|E

40|$|Pigments {{released}} from <b>phycoerythrins</b> and phycocyanins by treatment with hot methanol are currently regarded as {{equivalent to the}} native chromophores phycoerythrobilin and phycocyanobilin. However, evidence presented here confirms the original view of O'Carra & O'hEocha [(1966 Phytochemistry 5, 993 - 997] that these methanol-released pigments are artefacts differing in their chromophoric conjugated systems from the native protein-bound prosthetic groups. By contrast, the native spectral properties are retained in pigments released by careful acid treatment of the biliproteins and these acid-released phycobilins, rather than the methanol-released pigments, are therefore regarded as the protein-free forms of the native chromophores. The conclusion reached by Chapman, Cole & Siegelman [(1968) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 89, 3643 - 3645], that all the algal biliproteins contain only phycoerythrobilin and phycocyanobilin, is shown to be incorrect.

40|$|Background: Phycobilisomes (PBsomes) are the {{extrinsic}} antenna complexes {{upon the}} photosynthetic membranes in red algae and most cyanobacteria. The PBsomes in the cyanobacteria {{has been proposed}} to present high lateral mobility on the thylakoid membrane surface. In contrast, direct measurement of PBsome motility in red algae has been lacking so far. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this work, we investigated the dynamics of PBsomes in the unicellular red alga Porphyridium cruentum in vivo and in vitro, using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). We found {{that part of the}} fluorescence recovery could be detected in both partially- and wholly-bleached wild-type and mutant F 11 (UTEX 637) cells. Such partial fluorescence recovery was also observed in glutaraldehyde-treated and betaine-treated cells in which PBsome diffusion should be restricted by cross-linking effect, as well as in isolated PBsomes immobilized on the glass slide. Conclusions/Significance: On the basis of our previous structural results showing the PBsome crowding on the native photosynthetic membrane as well as the present FRAP data, we concluded that the fluorescence recovery observed during FRAP experiment in red algae is mainly ascribed to the intrinsic photoprocesses of the bleached PBsomes in situ, rather than the rapid diffusion of PBsomes on thylakoid membranes in vivo. Furthermore, direct observations of the fluorescence dynamics of <b>phycoerythrins</b> using FRAP demonstrated the energetic decoupling of <b>phycoerythrins</b> in PBsomes against strong excitation light in vivo, which is proposed as a photoprotective mechanism in red algae attributed by the PBsomes i...|$|R

The <b>phycoerythrins</b> (PEs) are one of four types of phycobiliproteins that are generally distinguished based on their absorption properties.

Here we present a statistical model based on in situ measurements of three transatlantic cruises which allows us to derive relative PE concentration from standardized hyperspectral underwater radiance measurements (Lu). The model relies on Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis of Lu spectra and, subsequently, a Generalized Linear Model with measured PE concentrations as the response variable and EOF loadings as predictor variables.

We observed mainly high-phycourobilin (PUB) PE related to small Synechococcus spp. (0. 6 -l. 4 urn). This PE was characterized by fluorescence excitation peaks at 496 and 550 nm in 50 % glycerol. Highest concentrations (0. 1 - 0. 2 ug L-l) were recorded either in the mixed layer (nutrient-enriched area) or at depth {{in the vicinity of}} the 0. 1 uM NO,- isopleth (oligotrophic waters). Maximum abundance of Synechococcus did not exceed 3 1 x 103 cell mL-t. No subpopulations of Synechococcus were evidenced by flow cytometry. Nevertheless, in a few samples, two new PE spectral types were observed. The first type was a high-PUB PE with two fluorescence excitation peaks at 494 and 564 nm.
