50|$|Belgium - Introduced in 1894. Every {{citizen and}} {{registered}} non-Belgian voter, {{from the age}} of 18 has to present themselves in their designated polling station on election day (always a Sunday), however casting a legal vote is not compulsory, legal sanctions still exist for those failing to present themselves, or appoint a proxy, without proper (legal) justification, but only the sanctions for absent appointed <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> <b>staff</b> have been enforced by prosecutors since 2003.|$|E
50|$|On 31 January 2014, the EC {{realised}} that 44,000 more {{election officials}} {{would be needed}} on polling day, including 4,000 people to oversee voting booths in the Thai capital. An EC commissioner explained to the media that a total of 93,305 <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> were being set up nationwide, but staff shortages were worst in the southern provinces, where 90 percent of <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> were insufficiently <b>staffed.</b> In addition to the staffing problems, ballots for 14 southern provinces remained undelivered at central post offices in the provinces of Chumphon, Nakhon Si Thammarat, and Songkhla. The EC stated that the election should proceed legitimately in more than 66 provinces, with a second opportunity offered on 2 March for those constituencies that were unable to vote. An army spokesman stated that soldiers would protect all <b>polling</b> <b>stations,</b> but explained that force would not be employed to end conflict between voters and anti-government protesters.|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{widespread}} protests over {{the handling of}} the election in Hadiya, elections in seven constituencies were re-run on 25 June of that year, which involved several teams of diplomatic observers, and <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> were <b>staffed</b> by National Election Board of Ethiopia coordinators from the capital (due to mistrust of local officials), which resulted with the opposition party (Hadiya National Democratic Organization, HNDO) winning six of seven of the races. However, in a press conference held by Dr. Beyene Petros in the following month, he accused local cadres of the ruling party of avenging their electoral losses, telling drought victims in Hadiya, who asked for assistance, to go [...] "ask Beyene". Hadiya informants reported intimidation and harassment of HNDO members by cadres of the ruling party {{in the aftermath of the}} election, to show that they were still in control of the kebele and woreda structures.|$|R
50|$|Violence {{broke out}} during the {{elections}} on 9 April with over 200 violent incidents reported, concentrated mostly in Budgam district in addition to attacks on <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> with <b>poll</b> <b>staff</b> abandoning about 70% of election stations. Protesters tried to enforce a boycott that had been called by the separatists. 8 {{people were killed in}} clashes between mobs and security forces. Videos of Kashmiri youths beating up CRPF troops who did not retaliate, as well as videos of purported excesses by Indian troops created controversies. The repolling on 13 April was relatively peaceful with only one incident of stone-throwing reported, however with a very low voter turnout.|$|R
50|$|Failure to make {{adequate}} {{provision for}} disabled electors {{can result in}} the selective disenfranchisement of disabled people. Accessibility issues {{need to be considered}} in electoral law, voter registration, provisions for postal voting, the selection of polling stations, the physical equipment of those polling stations and the training of <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> <b>staff.</b> This disenfranchisement may be a deliberate facet of electoral law, a consequence of a failure to consider the needs of anyone other than non-disabled electors, or an ongoing failure to respond to identified shortcomings in provision.|$|E
5000|$|The African Union, {{of which}} Déby {{is the current}} chairperson, {{declared}} that the election was carried out [...] "without fraud" [...] despite various discrepancies in the electoral process. The report stated that various <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> <b>staff</b> were under-trained {{and of all the}} ballot boxes observed 81% of the ballot boxes were not checked to see if they were empty {{at the start of the}} polling. Furthermore, 10% of the polling stations did not provide secrecy in voting; however, the elections were peaceful and concluded fairly.|$|E
50|$|A {{recent example}} of an {{election}} being held void was when the 1997 election of Member of Parliament for Winchester, Mark Oaten, (Liberal Democrat) was contested by the Conservative Party candidate Gerry Malone. Oaten had won the seat by two votes, with 55 ballot papers had been rejected by the returning officer because {{they had not been}} stamped properly. Malone lodged an election petition in the High Court to contest the outcome. The petition was dealt with by special case in which Oaten joined. On 6 October 1997 Lord Justice Brooke ruled that the election was void: by a 1974 precedent the failure to stamp the ballots may have been the result of <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> <b>staff</b> forgetting, and had they been counted, Malone would have had a majority of two over Oaten.|$|E
5000|$|Massive voting with {{absentee}} ballots was reported from almost 10% of <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> in the Republic of Mariy-El, at 7% of <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> in Tatarstan, at 9% of <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> in Irkutsk and at 4.5% of <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> in Yekaterinburg ...|$|R
50|$|Among {{countries}} where voters are allocated {{to one or}} several specific <b>polling</b> <b>station(s)</b> (such as the <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> closest to the voter's residential address, or <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> within a particular district, province or state), some countries provide a mechanism by which voters can nevertheless cast their ballots on election day at a different <b>polling</b> <b>station.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{reasons for}} allocating voters to {{specific}} <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> are generally logistical. Absentee voting {{at a different}} <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> might be catered for by, for example, designating some larger <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> as available for absentee voting, and equipping such <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> with the ballot papers (or the means to produce ballot papers) applicable to an absentee voter.|$|R
50|$|There were {{difficulties}} in accessing <b>polling</b> <b>stations.</b> In Khan Younis Israeli soldiers opened fire against a school {{used as a}} <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> and by roadblocks prevented thousands of people from getting to the <b>polling</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|R
50|$|Australia House {{is usually}} the single largest <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> in Australian federal elections, with more votes being cast at the London <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> than at any <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> {{in any of the}} Australian States or Territories.|$|R
5000|$|Various {{government}} officials other than members of electoral commissions were reported at <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> especially in Omsk (30.6% of <b>polling</b> <b>stations),</b> {{but in other}} regions as well (at 5-6% of <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> in Barnaul, Adygea, Yekaterinburg, Yoshkar-Ola, Perm and Pskov) ...|$|R

25|$|Groups {{of voters}} waiting in queues at 10 pm were {{locked out of}} <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> in Sheffield Hallam, Manchester and Leeds; and police said one London <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> was open until 10.30 pm, which {{triggered}} a national review of <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> requirements led by the Electoral Commission.|$|R
50|$|The {{presiding}} {{officer and}} the poll clerk(s) {{are responsible for}} maintaining order in the <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> (this includes ensuring that candidates/agents/tellers {{in the vicinity of}} the <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> do not interfere with the election process and/or impede voters' access to/from the <b>polling</b> <b>station,</b> and removing any campaign literature from inside the <b>polling</b> <b>station)</b> and ensuring the secrecy and security of all ballots cast. They are under a duty to act impartially at all times.|$|R
50|$|There {{were about}} 5.9 million {{registered}} voters and about 11,000 <b>polling</b> <b>stations,</b> compared to about 4,000 <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> in the 2005 parliamentary election. The Zimbabwe Election Support Network {{said that there}} were insufficient <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> in urban areas, where the opposition is considered stronger, while the availability of <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> was better in rural areas, where ZANU-PF is considered stronger. According to the Electoral Commission, it planned to deploy 107,690 polling officers to oversee voting.|$|R
50|$|As in {{previous}} elections, {{there will be}} <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> outside Abkhazia, in Moscow and Cherkessk. For the first time, {{there will also be}} a <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> in Istanbul. All three <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> are assigned to District no. 5 in Sukhumi, where the Ministry for Foreign Affairs is located.|$|R
5000|$|The phrase <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> is {{also used}} in American English and in British English, {{although}} polling place is the building [...] and <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> is the specific room (or part of a room) where voters cast their votes. A polling place can contain one or more <b>polling</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Observers {{from the}} European Union {{afterwards}} [...] "assessed the closing and counting processes negatively in {{almost half of}} urban <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> observed, a very high figure for international observers to record, and even worse in rural <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> observed." [...] Counting was slow, a remarkably high number of ballots were ruled invalid, {{and there was a}} lack of transparency in the results. [...] "Result sheets were only displayed at 29 per cent of rural <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> observed and 36 per cent of urban <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> observed at the completion of counting. In 25 per cent of <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> observed, political party representatives were not provided with a copy of the results." ...|$|R
50|$|The Presiding Officers also {{announce}} {{the result of}} count at the <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> and paste {{a copy of the}} result outside the <b>polling</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|R
50|$|The early {{votes are}} {{transported to the}} voter's <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> in double envelopes. On {{election}} day, a voter can vote at the <b>polling</b> <b>station.</b> Before the early vote is counted, officials check if the voter has voted at the <b>polling</b> <b>station.</b> If that is the case, the vote is destroyed, with the inner envelope unopened. Early votes that do not reach the <b>polling</b> <b>station</b> in time are transported to the County Administrative Board and counted if the voter has not already voted.|$|R
50|$|There {{were over}} 108,000,000 {{eligible}} voters {{and almost all}} 95,000 <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> had webcams to observe the voting process. Following criticism {{of the vote in}} the December elections, 2 web cameras were dedicated to streaming the activities at each <b>polling</b> <b>station,</b> at an expense of a half billion dollars, i.e. about $5,000 per <b>polling</b> <b>station.</b>|$|R

50|$|The GeenPeil {{campaign}} set out {{to investigate}} whether the reduced budget would influence the number of <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> each municipality would open for the GeenPeil referendum. On 13 December 2015, over 40 municipalities (out {{of a total of}} 396) indicated they were planning to tentatively or definitely reduce the number of <b>polling</b> <b>stations.</b> Although in some cases the reduction only concerns one <b>polling</b> <b>station,</b> in other cases over 50% of the standard <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> for elections are to remain closed for this referendum. Multiple reasons - including a lower budget - were given for the decisions. On 15 December 2015, the municipality Oldenzaal based the decision to reduce the standard 17 <b>polling</b> <b>stations</b> with 70% to just 5 stations on 'budgetary reasons'.|$|R
