500|$|According to Jane O'Grady, Williams {{was central}} to the {{decision}} by King's in 1972 to admit women, one of three all-male undergraduate colleges to do so that year. Martha Nussbaum wrote that he was [...] "as close to being a feminist as a powerful man of his generation could be." [...] In both his first and second marriages, he supported his wives in their careers and helped with the children more than was common for men at the time. In the 1970s, when Nussbaum's thesis supervisor, G. E. L. Owen, was harassing female students, and she decided nevertheless to support him, Williams told her, during a walk along the backs at Cambridge: [...] "ou know, there is a price you are <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> support and encouragement. Your dignity is being held hostage. You really don't {{have to put up}} with this." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1876 {{hostilities}} {{broke out}} with the Bapedi people under Sekhukhune. Burgers had told the Acting President Piet Joubert not {{to fight a war}} in his absence, so the Transvaal government did little to combat the Bapedi raids. On his return Burgers resolved to send a commando against Sekhukhune; he called on Kruger to lead the column, but much to his surprise the erstwhile Commandant-General refused. Burgers unsuccessfully asked Joubert to head the commando, then approached Kruger twice more, but to no avail. Kruger was convinced that God would cause any military expedition organised by Burgers to fail—particularly if the President rode with the commando, which he was determined to do. [...] "I cannot lead the commando if you come", Kruger said, [...] "for, with your merry evenings in laager and your Sunday dances, the enemy will even shoot me behind the wall; for God's blessing will not rest on your expedition." [...] Burgers, who had no military experience, led the commando himself after several other prospective generals rebuffed him. After being routed by Sekhukhune, he hired a group of [...] "volunteers" [...] under the German Conrad von Schlickmann to defend the country, <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> by levying a special tax. The war ended, but Burgers became extremely unpopular among his electorate.|$|E
