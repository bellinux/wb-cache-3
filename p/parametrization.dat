Astrophysical constraints from LSS, CMB and BBN are laid down to test the physical viability and cosmological compatibility of these <b>parametrizations.</b> A critical evaluation of the 4 -index <b>parametrizations</b> reveals that Hannestad-Mörtsell as well as Lee <b>parametrizations</b> are simple and transparent in probing {{the evolution of the}} dark energy during the expansion history of the universe and they satisfy the LSS, CMB and BBN constraints on the dark energy density parameter for the best fit values. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThrough {{the use of}} {{balanced}} realizations it {{has been}} possible to derive <b>parametrizations</b> and canonical forms for various classes of minimal linear systems of given dimension. A possible problem of these <b>parametrizations</b> {{is that they are}} not overlapping. This could be a drawback for the application of balanced <b>parametrizations</b> in such areas as system identification, model reduction and optimization. It is the topic of this paper to derive overlapping <b>parametrizations</b> which are closely related to the existing balanced <b>parametrizations.</b> We first introduce input-normal canonical forms which are defined through a novel way of choosing nice selections of columns of the reachability matrix. These canonical forms provide overlapping <b>parametrizations</b> {{in the sense that they}} form a real analytic atlas of the manifold of systems which are considered. Then we introduce so-called block-balanced input normal forms which use the previously constructed input normal forms as building blocks. The classes of systems for which such <b>parametrizations</b> are given are the stable minimal systems, positive-real minimal systems, bounded-real minimal systems and the class of all minimal systems of given McMillan degree. The results include both the single-input single-output and the multivariable case. In the single-input single-output case, however, the issue of choosing nice selections of columns does not occur. Therefore in this case the derivation and presentation of the results is considerably simplified...|$|R

These coarse-grained stochastic <b>parametrizations</b> involve systematically derived birth/death processes with low computational overhead {{that allow for}} direct interaction of the coarse-grained dynamical variables with the smaller-scale unresolved fluctuations. It is established here for an idealized prototype climate scenario that, in suitable regimes, these coarse-grained stochastic <b>parametrizations</b> can significantly impact the climatology as well as strongly increase the wave fluctuations about an idealized climatology...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{knowledge}} of cross sections for pion production in proton-proton collisions finds wide application in particle physics, astrophysics, cosmic ray physics and space radiation problems, especially {{in situations where}} an incident proton is transported through some medium, and one requires {{knowledge of}} the output particle spectrum given the input spectrum. In such cases accurate <b>parametrizations</b> of the cross sections are desired. In this paper we review much of the experimental data and compare {{to a wide variety}} of different cross section <b>parametrizations.</b> In so doing, we provide <b>parametrizations</b> of neutral and charged pion cross sections which provide a very accurate description of the experimental data. Lorentz invariant differential cross sections, spectral distributions and total cross section <b>parametrizations</b> are presented. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{experiments}} testing gravitational lensing {{and light}} time delay limits the same post-Newtonian parameter, the so-called Eddington parameter γ, {{which is a}} straightforward <b>parametrization</b> {{of the amount of}} deflection of light by a gravitational source. It is equal to one for general relativity, and takes different values in other theories (such as Brans–Dicke theory). It is the best constrained of the ten post-Newtonian parameters, but there are other experiments designed to constrain the others. Precise observations of the perihelion shift of Mercury constrain other parameters, as do tests of the strong equivalence principle.|$|E
25|$|Another {{class of}} methods assesses whether the {{inference}} {{was successful in}} light of the given observed data, for example, by comparing the posterior predictive distribution of summary statistics to the summary statistics observed. Beyond that, cross-validation techniques and predictive checks represent promising future strategies to evaluate the stability and out-of-sample predictive validity of ABC inferences. This is particularly important when modeling large data sets, because then the posterior support of a particular model can appear overwhelmingly conclusive, even if all proposed models in fact are poor representations of the stochastic system underlying the observation data. Out-of-sample predictive checks can reveal potential systematic biases within a model and provide clues on to how to improve its structure or <b>parametrization.</b>|$|E
40|$|We place {{observational}} {{constraints on}} models with the late-time cosmic acceleration {{based on a}} number of <b>parametrizations</b> allowing fast transitions for the equation of state of dark energy. In addition to the model of Linder and Huterer where the dark energy equation of state w monotonically grows or decreases in time, we propose two new <b>parametrizations</b> in which w has an extremum. We carry out the likelihood analysis with the three <b>parametrizations</b> by using the observational data of supernovae type Ia, cosmic microwave background, and baryon acoustic oscillations. Although the transient cosmic acceleration models with fast transitions can give rise to the total chi square smaller than that in the Λ-Cold-Dark-Matter (ΛCDM) model, these models are not favored over ΛCDM when one uses the Akaike information criterion which penalizes the extra degrees of freedom present in the <b>parametrizations.</b> Comment: 10 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

In the finite element approximation we use interpolation that restricts the treatment of rotations to the finite element nodes. Mutual relationships between different <b>parametrizations</b> are very clearly established and presented by informative commutative diagrams.

500|$|The Big Bang theory {{offers a}} {{comprehensive}} explanation {{for a broad}} range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the CMB, large scale structure, and Hubble's Law. The framework for the Big Bang model relies on Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity and on simplifying assumptions such as homogeneity and isotropy of space. The governing equations were formulated by Alexander Friedmann, and similar solutions were worked on by Willem de Sitter. Since then, astrophysicists have incorporated observational and theoretical additions into the Big Bang model, and its <b>parametrization</b> as the Lambda-CDM model serves as the framework for current investigations of theoretical cosmology.
