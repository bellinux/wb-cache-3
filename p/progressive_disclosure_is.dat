5000|$|<b>Progressive</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>is</b> an {{interaction}} design technique that sequences information and actions across several screens {{in order to}} reduce feelings of being overwhelmed for the user. By disclosing information progressively, you reveal only the essentials and help the user manage the complexity of feature-rich sites or applications. Progressive disclosure follows the typical notion of moving from [...] "abstract to specific"; only it may mean sequencing interactions and not necessarily level of detail (information). In other words, <b>progressive</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>is</b> not just about displaying abstract then specific information, but rather about 'ramping up' the user from simple to more complex actions.|$|E
50|$|A {{system is}} said to be feature-rich when it has many options and {{functional}} capabilities available to the user. <b>Progressive</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>is</b> a technique applied to reduce the potential confusion caused by displaying a wealth of features at once.|$|E
50|$|<b>Progressive</b> <b>disclosure</b> can <b>be</b> {{validated}} by conducting task analysis (behavioral observation) with a user base. Observing users {{in their native}} problem solving environment provides data about how they interact with the information.|$|R
50|$|An {{example for}} Staged <b>Disclosure</b> <b>is</b> an online news article that is spread across four screens (with a Next Page link at the bottom). This use of <b>progressive</b> <b>disclosure</b> serves {{advertising}} objectives (showing banners on each page) {{and not the}} user's task.|$|R

50|$|<b>Progressive</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>is</b> an {{interaction}} design technique {{that emerges from}} the insights gained during Task Analysis (user observation of tasks). Observing users in the field, allows one to understand their workflow outside of specific technologies. This insight provides the necessary data required to prioritize and sequence content and functionality.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} <b>progressive</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>is</b> the print dialog {{where you can}} {{initially}} choose how many copies to print, the printer to use and {{whether you want to}} print the full document or only certain pages. On the secondary (advanced options) screen one can then modify the full set of options.|$|E
50|$|Historically, <b>progressive</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>is</b> {{a concept}} {{that came from the}} {{software}} usability experience. It is clearly easier to apply to software than it is on websites. In software (including in web applications), the interaction is between dialogues and 'fixed state' interactions. On websites, interactions are chaotic, randomized and dynamic because hypertext is a non-linear media.|$|E

50|$|<b>Progressive</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>is</b> an {{interaction}} design technique {{often used in}} human computer interaction to help maintain {{the focus of a}} user's attention by reducing clutter, confusion, and cognitive workload. This improves usability by presenting only the minimum data required for the task at hand. The principle is used in journalism's inverted pyramid style, learning's spiral approach, and the game twenty questions.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Progressive</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>is</b> {{a concept}} that {{has been around since}} at least the early 1980s. The {{technique}} caught the attention of user interface specialists with Jack Carroll's lab work at IBM (1983), where he found that hiding advanced functionality early on led to an increased success of its use later on. The approach dubbed [...] "training wheels" [...] {{is one of the few}} references validating the technique. Carroll and Rosson (1997) pointed out that no empirical evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of progressive disclosure and that the training wheels approach only studied a [...] "single computer application (word processor) and a single interface style (menu based control)". While independent usability studies and consultancy research (including our own) has shown that appropriate usage of the technique is valuable, more empirical research is clearly required.|$|E
5000|$|In {{its most}} formal definition, <b>progressive</b> <b>disclosure</b> means [...] "to move complex and less {{frequently}} used options {{out of the}} main user interface and into secondary screens".|$|R
50|$|<b>Progressive</b> <b>disclosure</b> {{on the web}} is {{when one}} only shows {{information}} that is relevant to the task the user wants to focus on, on any given page. Google pioneered this strategy with context-sensitive text ads.|$|R

40|$|Empirical {{studies do}} not make a clear {{distinction}} between {{the quantity and quality of}} <b>disclosure.</b> As it <b>is</b> generally assumed that the quantity of information has an implication in determining its quality, quantity measures are often used as proxy for disclosure quality. Nonetheless, the measurement of the quality of <b>disclosure</b> <b>is</b> recognized as a relevant question that is still open and the importance of developing measures of <b>disclosure</b> quality <b>is</b> emphasized in literature. This paper disputes the idea that the quantity of <b>disclosure</b> <b>is</b> a sound proxy for the quality of disclosure. The adoption of multidimensional frameworks for the appreciation of <b>disclosure</b> <b>is</b> discussed and an index for quality <b>disclosure</b> <b>is</b> proposed. Moving from the assumption that high-quality information should usefully support external users in the judgment of past and future performance, we hypothesize that highquality <b>disclosure</b> <b>is</b> positively associated with accuracy and negatively associated with the dispersion of analysts’earnings forecasts. We show analytically that the proposed framework captures dimensions of annual report <b>disclosure</b> that <b>are</b> considered useful by financial analysts in forecasting earnings and that the proposed measure of disclosure quality has a stronger positive statistical association with accuracy and a stronger negative association with the dispersion of financial analysts’ earnings forecasts than a simple index of disclosure quantity has...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{how to improve}} feasibility in disclosing personal distress by writing. Disclosing personal distresses, such as mental problems, by writing {{is thought to be}} good for health. However, qualitative research about the utility of written <b>disclosure</b> <b>was</b> not been conducted enough. Written <b>disclosure</b> <b>is</b> a single-handed approach contrary to oral disclosure. To fully utilize written disclosure, the exploration of its process is important. In this study, a 3 -day written <b>disclosure</b> task <b>was</b> introduced to eight Japanese undergraduate students individually. Semi-structured interviews were conducted one week after the task. Analyses with the KJ method suggested written <b>disclosure</b> <b>was</b> often used when participants felt uncomfortable receiving advice directly from others, and it helped the writer better express his/her problems. Furthermore, successful experiences of <b>disclosure</b> <b>were</b> found to increase positive attitudes toward using written disclosure. Results suggested participants were sometimes hesitant to write about their serious issues, so dealing with less severe issues on the ﬁrst day would be advisable. Also, written <b>disclosure</b> <b>was</b> thought to be more appropriate than oral disclosure when the participant had not necessarily pinpointed the cause of the problem...|$|R

40|$|We {{conducted}} {{three studies}} {{to understand how}} online emotional <b>disclosure</b> <b>is</b> influenced by social network structure on Facebook. Results showed that emotional <b>disclosure</b> <b>was</b> associated with both the density and size of users’ personal networks. Facebook users with denser networks disclosed more positive and negative emotions, and the relation between network density and emotional <b>disclosure</b> <b>was</b> mediated by stronger need for emotional expression. Facebook users with larger networks on Facebook disclosed more positive emotions, and the relation between network size and emotional <b>disclosure</b> <b>was</b> mediated by a stronger need for impression management. Our study extends past research by revealing the psychological mechanisms through which personal social network structure influences emotional disclosure. It suggests that social network size and density are associated with different psychological needs, which in turn lead to different patterns of emotional disclosure...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to relate the extent of {{disclosure}} in the annual reports of French listed companies to some economic determinants. The sample includes the 1995 annual reports of 102 randomly selected industrial and commercial firms. The extent of <b>disclosure</b> <b>is</b> measured by an index based on financial and non-financial discretionary information. The model of hypothesis explaining voluntary <b>disclosure</b> <b>is</b> defined as the interplay of contradictory forces: inducements deriving principally from agency theory and limitations imposed by information costs. The results reveal that voluntary <b>disclosure</b> <b>is</b> significantly related to size, foreign activity and to a proxy for proprietary costs. ...|$|R

This study investigates the disclosure of social and environmental responsibilities within the annual reports of the consumer and industrial industries. Social and environmental <b>disclosure</b> indexes <b>are</b> used to assess disclosure, comparing the results of each industry, and comparing the social disclosure indexes with environmental indexes. The results show that social <b>disclosure</b> <b>is</b> similar between the two industries and less varied than environmental disclosure.
