40|$|The European Union (EU) {{has long}} {{recognized}} that corporate tax differences dis-tort, to some extent, trade between and investment across {{the borders of}} member states. While significant differences remain, convergence of important aspects of corporate tax regimes has occurred. Other studies have considered convergence of tax rates, systems and elements of individual company tax bases. This paper evaluates EU rules concerning {{a key element of}} corporate tax base calculation: tax group recognition. Functional recognition of tax groups — for substantial tax reliefs, for miti-gation of double taxation and for anti-avoidance purposes — has implications for the calculation of effective corporate tax cost. Structural recognition employs dis-tinct tax group 'concepts' that may influence choice of organizational structures. Both aspects of recognition may create economic distortion. Although many differences persist, some convergence of group substantial tax reliefs toward a de jure near-complete control concept is observed. Relief of double taxation on inter-corporate dividends tends to employ a de jure <b>permanent</b> <b>participation</b> concept. Anti-avoidance legislation adopts a broader concept, usually de facto common control. The forces promoting convergence, including EU accounting harmonization, are identified. More explicit and consistent use of tax group concepts would, the paper concludes, improve EU direct tax harmoni-zation initiatives. ...|$|R
40|$|As a {{reaction}} to the recommendation of the European Commission, the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety developed a strategy for Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM). This strategy forms the first federal standardised milestone of an ICZM process in Germany. Since the strategy is in its infancy, it is not succeeded yet implementing all principles of “good ICZM”. Especially aspects of implementation, responsibility, and funding need to be concretised to enhance ICZM in Germany. Within a research, the follow-ing questions are addressed: first, what are the shortcomings of the German ICZM strategy? And second, what can Germany learn from its neighbouring countries Belgium, the Netherlands, and United Kingdom? After conducting a deficit analysis of the German strategy, the focus is set on the foreign ICZM strategies and activities. On the basis of lessons learned, the most auspicious findings are transferred to German conditions. These are the establishment of a central ICZM se-cretariat, which organises and coordinates the entire ICZM process in Germany. Furthermore, the development of a “coastal barometer”, which provides a simple, manageable and user-friendly set of coastal indicators to measure the sustainable use of the coast. Finally, the initiation of a stake-holder involvement strategy, to ensure early and <b>permanent</b> <b>participation</b> of stakeholders in ICZM processes.

40|$|AbstractThe basic {{mission of}} the {{universities}} in the current century has been undergoing a transformation since the last two centuries. This transformation also affects the degrees of emphasis on missions with the content. Community service missions have been taking precedence over education and research missions in 21 st century universities. Also current missions have been re- designed by integrating {{each other and the}} key elements such as strategy and sustainable development. The biggest difference of this design from the earlier models in universities is effective and <b>permanent</b> <b>participation</b> of the internal and external environmental conditions to this process. The success of this participation is possible by making the participation of the students, academic and administrative employees as internal stakeholders and alumni, business, central and local governments and civil society organizations as external stakeholders to the processes in higher education more functional. In this context the subject of this study is researching the internal and external stakeholders view on mission and vision of Selçuk University's surveys data in the axis of a conceptual model designed for developing sustainable relations with a comparative method. In this study first, university and stakeholders relations are discussed with conceptual dimension and changing process's components.

60|$|Ireland was {{the subject}} of the first great battle between the {{ministry}} and their opponents. Here, if anywhere, we might have expected from Burke at least his usual wisdom and patience. We saw in a previous chapter (p. 33) what the political condition of Ireland was when Burke went there with Hamilton in 1763. The American war had brought about a great change. The king had shrewdly predicted that if America became free Ireland would soon follow the same plan and be a separate state. In fact, along with the American war we had to encounter an Irish war also; but the latter was, as an Irish politician called it at the time, a smothered war. Like the Americans, the Anglo-Irish entered into non-importation compacts, and they interdicted commerce. The Irish volunteers, first forty, then sixty, and at last a hundred thousand strong, were virtually an army enrolled to overawe the English ministry and Parliament. Following the spirit, if not the actual path, of the Americans, they raised a cry for commercial and legislative independence. They were too strong to be resisted, and in 1782 the Irish Parliament acquired the privilege of initiating and conducting its own business, without the sanction or control either of the Privy Council or of the English Parliament. Dazzled by the chance of acquiring legislative independence, they had been content with the comparatively small commercial boons obtained by Lord Nugent and Burke in 1778, and with the removal of further restrictions by the alarmed minister in the following year. After the concession of their independence in 1782, they found that to procure the abolition of the remaining restrictions on their commerce--the right of trade, for instance, with America and Africa--the consent of the English legislature was as necessary as it had ever been. Pitt, fresh from the teaching of Adam Smith and of Shelburne, brought forward in 1785 his famous commercial propositions. The theory of his scheme was that Irish trade should be free, and that Ireland should be admitted to a <b>permanent</b> <b>participation</b> in commercial advantages. In return for this gain, after her hereditary revenue passed a certain point, she was to devote the surplus to purposes, such as the maintenance of the navy, in which the two nations had a common interest. Pitt was to be believed when he declared that of all the objects of his political life this was, in his opinion, the most important that he had ever engaged in, and he never expected to meet another that should rouse every emotion in so strong a degree as this.|$|R

40|$|In January 2008, the Pilot River Basins (PRB) network on {{agricultural}} issues {{entered into}} a new phase. The main purpose was the exchange of information during the ongoing preparation of the river basin management plans (RBMP) and programme of measures (PoM). In early 2009, members of the PRB-AGRI network decided {{to go beyond the}} mandate and share better their experience on four specific topics: (i) Effectiveness and acceptance of measures; (ii) Public Participation, involvement of farmers; (iii) Monitoring and evaluation of measures and (iv) Impact of climate change on RBMP. This document gathers articles from PRBs and the conclusions from PRB-AGRI workshops related to the topics mentioned above. As main conclusions, it could be highlighted that cost effectiveness analysis of measures should include environmental and resources costs, farmers¿ acceptance and the societal point of view and be based on scientific evidence. It was well agreed that measures efficiency and feasibility should be tested at local level, even if the overall solution to reduce impact and pressures should be found at river basin scale, and that surveillance and operational monitoring programmes should state out how effective the measures have been and lead {{to a better understanding of}} the pollution sources and their dynamics. While monitoring the implementation of the PoM remains complex, it is an essential task and PRBs have stressed as well that the need for collaboration between administration levels and that difficulties in monitoring could vary depending on lag-time, status of the measure (compulsory vs. voluntary) and financing. An early involvement of the agricultural sector at all scales and its commitments towards plans is a factor for success. More generally, the approach to public participation should be adapted to the institutional, socioeconomic and environmental context of the river basin. PRBs have showed how that was working on the ground, based on pilot projects, innovative approaches, multidisciplinary teams or more <b>permanent</b> <b>participation</b> organisations. The main challenge was often said to be rebuilding trust - perhaps more than interest - to enhance participation between planners, farmers and local population. It is often a challenge to involve farmers and dialogue should include all of them. Strategies and messages have to be tailored and it is also crucial to have a bunch of measures to ensure flexibility and to propose an adapted funding system. All in all, it should not be ignored that stakeholders¿ involvement takes time. The use of models as decision-support tool is widely widespread amongst PRBs. First, they make possible to analyse pressures and evaluate the gaps and are helpful in the selection of best measures to implement. Second, they help to monitor the effect of the measures on the long term as well as the value for money, and propose climate change scenarios. In order to obtain the right picture, these tools need to be fed by robust data, long time data series and feedbacks from the field. Monitoring systems are a crucial piece of the puzzle and must be appropriately designed to provide useful data, and help water planners in their approach to cope with uncertainties which could have a significant impact in the decision-making. Regarding the climate change issue, even if some PRBs have demonstrated that they have already considered the phenomenon in their RBMP, it is generally acknowledged that it will concern more the next generation of the plans. Scientific knowledge is the prerequisite to understand the ongoing processes and the likely impacts of a changed climate. Climate change will influence socio-economic development and could lead to the redefinition of targets or reference conditions for water bodies if appropriated actions are not implemented. Programmes of measures must be climate checked in order to not run counterproductive actions both in terms of cost and effectiveness. JRC. DDG. H. 5 -Rural, water and ecosystem resource...|$|R

This can influence the future productivity of teaching and research in different countries. Our research is specifically concerned with the factors that may explain the conditions that lead to integration of researchers and lecturers in the academic career in France. More precisely, the paper analyses the factors affecting the access duration to a permanent job in the French academic sector. We use data from a French survey ?Generation 2001 ?, carried out by the Cereq. We focus on a sample of 1400 individuals who obtained their PhDs in 2001 and were interviewed in 2004. A discrete time model is used to analyse the main factors influencing the access duration. In addition, in order to assess the effect of a post-doctoral position on the academic job search, our empirical approach involves estimation of models that simultaneously explain the access duration to a <b>permanent</b> job and <b>participation</b> to a post-doc program. Our main results indicate that the scientific publications and post-doc have an influence on the access duration to a permanent job, which is coherent with the idea that potential employers use this information as a proxy of research and teaching abilities.

Salmon behaviour in the river before spawning was analyzed using radio telemetry. The salmon were caught at Forshaga power plant, radio-tagged and returned to Klarälven at Ekshärad, 107 km from the river’s mouth. Permanent stations with antennas were deployed at seven different locations along the river, to register all radio-tagged salmon.

Without <b>participation</b> in spawning or remaining in the river 71 % hatchery-reared and 6 % wild salmon swam downstream and were registered at the first power plant downstream of their site of release. The average period the returning salmons stayed above the power plants was 22. 5 days. Hatchery-reared salmon had significantly more and longer up- and downstream movements than wild salmon in the river. Hatchery-reared salmon were significantly shorter and weighed less than wild salmon. A higher percentage of wild salmon (94 %) than hatchery-reared salmon (24 %) were registered at the spawning grounds.

The first limb of the {{sub-section}} (i.e. [...] "is {{under any}} acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience, or {{adherence to a}} foreign power") involves an element of acceptance or at least acquiescence {{on the part of}} the relevant person. … In conformity with the purpose of the sub-section, the second limb (i.e. [...] "is a subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights or privileges of a subject or citizen of a foreign power") should, in my view, be construed as impliedly containing a similar mental element with the result that it applies only to cases where the relevant status, rights or privileges have been sought, accepted, asserted or acquiesced in by the person concerned. The effect of that construction of the sub-section is that an Australian-born citizen is not disqualified by reason of the second limb of s.44(i) unless he or she has established, asserted, accepted, or acquiesced in, the relevant relationship with the foreign power. The position is more difficult in a case such as the present where the relationship with the foreign power existed before the acquisition (or re-acquisition) of Australian citizenship. In such a case, what will be involved is not the acquisition or establishment, for the purposes of s.44, of the relevant relationship with the foreign power but the relinquishment or extinguishment of it. It does, however, seem to me that the purpose which s.44 seeks to attain and which [...] "must always be kept in mind" [...] re Webster (1975) would not have included the <b>permanent</b> exclusion from <b>participation</b> at the highest level in the political life of the nation of any Australian citizen whose origins lay in, or who has had some past association with, some foreign country which asserts an entitlement to refuse to allow or recognize his or her genuine and unconditional renunciation of past allegiance or citizenship. Accordingly, and notwithstanding that citizenship of a country is ordinarily a matter determined by the law of that country …, the qualifying element which must be read into the second limb of s.44(i) extends not only to the acquisition of the disqualifying relationship by a person who is already an Australian citizen but also to the retention of that relationship by a person who has subsequently become an Australian citizen. A person who becomes an Australian citizen will not be within the second limb of s.44(i) if he or she has done all that can reasonably be expected of him or her to extinguish any former relationship with a foreign country to the extent that it involves the status, rights or privileges referred to in the sub-section.|$|R
40|$|ON-LINE EDUCATION: AN EMANCIPATING VISION Written by Margarita Victoria Gomez Publisher: Cortez Editora ISBN 85 - 249 - 1062 - 3 São Paulo, Brazil, July 2004. Reviewed by Ricardo Romo TORRES Manuel Moreno Castaneda Maria del Sol Orozco Aguirre Universidad de Guadalajara Virtual MEXICO [URL] "On-line Education " is a {{book that}} meets the {{challenge}} to present itself as an unfinished text. In addition to demanding an active participation of the reader, it requires a predisposition to complete it through an also inconclusive dialogue. Among its goals we can find the search for education networks that remain under constant reconstruction, maintaining the emancipative vision as an imperative for the reconfiguration, as a constituted tissue for the scaffolding of subjects who impress,imagine, think and have a will. The unfinished part {{is presented in the}} following paragraph: "Similar to Babel according to Borges, knowledge {{is the product of a}} hazard in which fiction is the universe and where, out of fear of its multiple combinations, individual texts constitute an unfinished tale. In this labyrinth-shaped universe, the mirror and the recurrence do not allow finding the way out" page 134. The sense of being of man within a planetary community is framed by the ontological condition of conclusiveness; the requirement of being more, however, as well. This more is guided by the need for dialogue with others in terms of the opening and maintaining an unconcluded dialogue. The idea of a web or network leads to an articulating demand within the context of the category of wholeness. Based on this category, we will be able to present a reticulum of concepts where we can find included the web, subjectivity, identity, experience, mediation and, of course, digital literacy. This reticulum results in a concept of identified education with a condensed arrival point to something that the author defines as 'the pedagogy of virtuality'. The author is willing to contribute to the preparation of education networks through an emancipating vision, implying here a libertarian educational concept. This concept includes subjectivity related to fears and uncertainties of those who have recently joined the virtual feature. One of the merits of this work is to conceive the identity at the mark of an unfinished process, where the unconcluded subjects wish to be more based on the encounter between men and women. Thus, communication and dialogues embody modalities of accordance and conflict that have to be faced by the interacting subjects within the network. Another fundamental aspect is represented by the cyber culture where the identity problem has to be rethought and reintroduced in the networks sphere, considering the nconclusiveness of men and women. The experience of opening, in turn, is felt as a 'foundation experience' as long as it represents a pedagogic device. This refers to a new organization of acknowledgements whose demand follows a 'new organization of the experience' where the acknowledgements in their function of cognition find their articulations related to ethical and political levels. Even though the text is giving us a point of departure based on the concept of dialogic educational networks and a point of arrival of an educational concept that intends to agree with a pedagogy of virtuality, the mediation will be offered by the aspects of the pedagogic project, by the methodological questions, and by the evaluation. THE EDUCATION PROJECT ORIENTED TO PEDAGOGY OF VIRTUALITY From the project's point of view, virtual education, or education via internet, is created as an important option to insure that the subjects accept knowledge, debate over it and build up proposals that match their reality and their very context. All of this is accomplished while respecting the participant's subjectivity, culture and context, thus guiding to proposals of intervention that allow improving and even transforming the social, political and educative environment. Special attention is given to the procedures during the design and implementation of educational projects, from the technological to the pedagogic area, especially the moment where the content is related to the means, tools, objectives, competence, etc. In all of this, the emancipating ideas of Paulo Freire present themselves as a viable and realistic alternative for network education under the reference of pedagogy of virtuality. The pedagogy of virtuality is based on a technological appropriation, considering the principles of popular education, and aiming at the conformation of an open and democratic society that in turn should be supported by the ethical and political awareness of the subjects. Within the context of political education associated to a creative usage of the internet, the possibility of a transforming action is shown through a system that gives room for intervention based on a socio-historical view through which the pedagogical resources should be strengthened, especially with network support that includes actual situations in its design. One of the challenges of pedagogy of virtuality is to overcome a culture of silence through the creation of cyber culture circles. Within these circles, men and women retrieve their history and their culture, using the internet in a critical manner and in a creative way. Thus, individualistic and solipsistic attitudes will be surpassed by means of a cooperation method through which the attempt is made to set free a space for the participation of citizens. It has to be kept in mind, however, that from the point of view of pedagogy of virtuality, long distance education should not be one that homogenizes in time and space, but one where the dialogic mediations and the participation program allow and confirm the social being in an educative way. Based on the above mentioned point of view, long distance education has to be seen as a multi-disciplinary system where knowledge, perception and feelings are being involved that are committed to a new action that ranges from the aesthetic to the ethics. While the team observes and applies those principles, the simple visual reflection can be surpassed and exchanged by social and pedagogic contributions, thus acquiring an ethical-aesthetical experience. As a matter of fact, this experience has to be considered an achievement of the team that participated in the project, through the implementation and the development of this educative alternative. Among the strongest principles to be considered in a project of this nature are the following: to present a minimum of common denominators between the members of the team that works for the institution; to provide the work between institutions, and finally, to provide basic operational implementation through a multidisciplinary and specialized work that includes the choice of the software. In the same way, the proposition should consider symbolic aspects of the needs of the users, participants and the context, and after that an intensive analysis of the methodological type has to be performed in both the lineal and transversal mode of elaboration and implementation of the project, involving the knowledge and the chosen platform. In addition, special attention has to be given to communication with the team and also with the students through the virtual rooms that have been created for that purpose (written texts, images, sound, audio, links, forums, meetings in real time [chats], videoconferences, animations and simulations) as their participation might activate the potential of one of the involved subjects. METHODOLOGICAL FIELDS These fields remain open regarding the experience, as this experience carefully takes into account the record of the methodological dimensions of the participants' knowledge. The experience also implies a reflexive dimension, as it tries to make available to the knowledge base of the team members, a new manner of creating and producing courses. The courses are presented as educational projects in which several methodological strategies are considered, such as: brainstorming, work groups, group dynamics, questionnaires, and direct interviews in on-line time. While making a presentation of the structure of this type of course, a <b>permanent</b> <b>participation</b> of the people involved in the educational process should be encouraged. This interaction will allow the establishing of a foundation for other types of instruments that enrich the project, meaning that it will suggest a permanent systematization of the performed work, during and afterwards, thus outlining the collective work. During the creation process of WEB courses, it has to be considered that these are "oriented by popular education principles, the rhizome, by participation design, by ultiple subjects and by pedagogical mediations. According to our view, it involves a concrete exercise of the participants, a subject treatment of both the learning and the form. In the same way, it implies a socio-historical situation of the constituents of the project, an organization according to the methodologies that was constructed by them". With regard to the actual use of the proposition, it could be said that because of the moment and the conjuncture we are living in, it demands an educational situation of permanent innovation that provides new meaning with respect to the education of the teacher and, for that, the pedagogical mediation processes and the participation programs of web courses have to be acknowledged as relevant. Here it is also worth noting that this proposal does not only include a epistemological dimension but also presents in an outstanding way the 'how, why and for what' of long distance education by exposing several important points of the LDE–Long Distance Education), utilizing an emancipating vision that joins a series of pertinent ideas to a different model for the development of courses, to their processes, as well as to the more adequate forms of evaluation, including all of the actors in the educational process, as well as the materials, the pedagogical mediations and the means. EMANCIPATING EVALUATION The evaluation is considered to be a solid backbone of the educational process because of its importance for a permanent improvement of the courses and the interaction of the involved people during the appropriation of knowledge, as well as for the development of competencies and values. Based on this emancipating vision, the possibilities of the evaluation process may be considered based on the grounding of the evidence found in experience and thus, the education can be analyzed as an area that includes the teachers of the network as well as the whole interacting community. The shared responsibility of the programmers and the pedagogues that are involved in the evaluation should take on the criticism and the problematic as essential steps for the construction of an emancipating education. Irrespective of the evaluation done by the software of network learning, the process of forming evaluation has to be noted, as the technological resources allow for a new approach of the aspects referring to processes, their quality, and the ethics in the virtual sphere, because the communities formed there are linked to particular ideologies and world-views. This way, conditions may allow access to a flexible and interactive, as well as dialogic and contextual practice from the very beginning and, therefore, the triangulation of data obtained through the reports of the educational practices of the teacher, of the students, and of the participating observers allows a reliable evaluation. Finally, the evaluation as a device based on emancipation is conceived as an instrument for the purpose of hope for the future as it is supported by a larger process of education, having the objective of participating with unfinished and incomplete subjects in the permanent and inquisitive search for improving practices through communication, dialogue, mediation and strategies of learning that require a new understanding of the world. Thus, during the action of educating with criticism in the virtual sphere, the evaluation is the process that allows for developing practices that should contribute to the improvement of the quality of life, responding creatively to the social needs of education and achieving a pedagogical strengthening of new technologies, turning them into tools that render an emancipation service to men and women.
