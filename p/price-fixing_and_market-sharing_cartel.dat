40|$|There are <b>price-fixing</b> <b>cartels</b> <b>and</b> <b>market-sharing</b> <b>cartels,</b> <b>and</b> both {{adversely}} affect trade figures. A measurement matrix {{is used as}} a methodological framework through which content analysis is conducted to assess whether senior executives were involved in, and/or aware of, the cartel conduct occurring in their organisation. Sixty-nine court outcomes from eleven jurisdictions were analysed. It was found that senior management were involved in 80 % of matters analysed; the CEO of a company was actively engaged in 7 % of matters; and that the termination of a cartel member’s employment occurred in only 3 % of outcomes. The findings suggest that there is still a substantial task ahead for competition regulators to educate and raise the awareness of business people to ensure the provisions of relevant legislation are clearly understood...|$|R

50|$|In {{relation}} to the bias against equity building activities, marketing budgets optimized using marketing-mix models may tend too much towards efficiency because marketing-mix models measure only the short-term effects of marketing. Longer term effects of marketing are reflected in its brand equity. The impact of marketing spend on equity is usually not captured by marketing-mix models. One {{reason is that the}} longer duration that marketing takes to impact brand perception extends beyond the simultaneous or, at best, weeks-ahead impact of marketing on sales that these models measure. The other reason is that temporary fluctuation in sales due to economic and social conditions do not necessarily mean that marketing has been ineffective in building brand equity. On the contrary, it is very possible that in the short term sales <b>and</b> <b>market-share</b> could deteriorate, but brand equity could actually be higher. This higher equity should in the long run help the brand recover sales <b>and</b> <b>market-share.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The dataset contains {{the results of a}} survey gauging public attitudes to <b>price-fixing</b> <b>and</b> cartel enforcement mechanisms. It was carried out in Britain, Germany, Italy and the United States. This research builds on a 2007 survey by the same author (Public Attitudes to Price Fixing in Britain, 2007, held under SN 7884), which was the first ever survey of GB consumer attitudes to cartels. To ensure balanced and unbiased results, respondents were mainly presented with various scenarios and were asked to either agree or strongly agree with one of two balanced alternatives. They also had the option to agree with neither, or select "don't know". The survey asked respondents about their attitudes towards <b>price-fixing</b> <b>and</b> their preferences in relation to punishment, leniency and other relevant enforcement tools. The conclusions are likely to find similar attitudes and preferences between consumers {{in each of the four}} jurisdictions, despite significant differences in culture, legal tradition and levels of enforcement.

It held that, {{despite the}} breadth of the {{language}} of the Supreme Court’s decisions on exhaustion, the apparently absolute rule against post-sale restrictions on patentees' customers should apply only to <b>price-fixes</b> <b>and</b> tie-ins. In cases not involving price-fixes or tie-ins, such as this one, patentees were free to limit their customer's use of products as long as the restrictions did not so greatly hinder competition as to amount to an antitrust violation.|$|R
