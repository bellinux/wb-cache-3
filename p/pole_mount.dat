5000|$|Fisheries {{acoustic}} {{research is}} conducted {{from a variety}} of platforms. The most common is a traditional research vessel, with the echosounders mounted on the ship's hull or in a drop keel. If the vessel does not have permanently installed echosounders, they may be deployed on a <b>pole</b> <b>mount</b> attached to the ship's side, or on a towed body or [...] "towfish" [...] pulled behind or alongside the vessel. Towed bodies are particularly useful for studies of deep-living fish, such as the orange roughy, which typically live below the range of an echosounder at the surface.|$|E
50|$|Modules are {{assembled}} into arrays on {{some kind}} of mounting system, which may be classified as ground mount, roof mount or <b>pole</b> <b>mount.</b> For solar parks a large rack is mounted on the ground, and the modules mounted on the rack.For buildings, many different racks have been devised for pitched roofs. For flat roofs, racks, bins and building integrated solutions are used. Solar panel racks mounted on top of poles can be stationary or moving, see Trackers below. Side-of-pole mounts are suitable for situations where a pole has something else mounted at its top, such as a light fixture or an antenna. Pole mounting raises what would otherwise be a ground mounted array above weed shadows and livestock, and may satisfy electrical code requirements regarding inaccessibility of exposed wiring. Pole mounted panels are open to more cooling air on their underside, which increases performance. A multiplicity of pole top racks can be formed into a parking carport or other shade structure. A rack which does not follow the sun from left to right may allow seasonal adjustment up or down.|$|E

The Thin Place was once the {{destination}} of the religious pilgrim seeking transcendence in an extreme environment. In our age, the Thin Place quest has morphed into a challenge to evolve {{beyond the confines of}} our own physiology; through human ingenuity and invention, we reach places not meant to accommodate human life. The early Antarctic explorer Apsley Cherry-Garrard defined exploration as “the physical expression of intellectual passion. ” Our quests to explore the end of the earth, the top of the world, and into outer space exemplify this definition. Moreover, these quests have great metaphoric value; they are symbolic of supreme achievement, and help define {{what it means to be}} human...|$|E
40|$|An {{overview}} of the research and developments into new transformer design, undertaken in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Canterbury, is presented. Initially, single phase, 50 Hz, l 1 / 0. 23 kV <b>pole</b> <b>mount</b> distribution transformers were fitted with either silicon or amorphous steel cores. The transformer tanks were filled with either standard transformer oil or liquid nitrogen and tested for loss performance. Next a partial core transformer was designed, built and tested for its performance in air and while immersed in liquid nitrogen. The transformer {{was designed as a}} mock up of a proposed high temperature superconducting transformer, but with aluminium windings. The partial core was a slug of laminated silicon steel. A commercial manifestation of a partial core transformer is demonstrated in a parallel resonant compensation test method. Initially this uses a HV inductance that supplies reactive power to the insulation of a hydro generator stator. As a further development, the inductor was turned into a resonant transformer by the addition of a LV primary. The magnetising reactance was matched to the generator stator insulation capacitance. A second tunable resonant transformer was then designed. Finally, a high temperature super-conducting transformer (HTST) has been designed and built. The transformer windings are configured to allow different arrangements, namely internal primary, external primary and autotransformer...|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} network of the Swaziland Electricity Company {{consists of a}} number of components like distribution lines, wooden poles, insulators, conductors, <b>pole</b> <b>mounted</b> transformers and metering, to mention but a few. The most expensive of these components per unit cost is the <b>pole</b> <b>mounted</b> transformer and it takes longer to install. The {{distribution network}} is the less reliable compared to the transmission network, and its components fail regularly, and the <b>pole</b> <b>mounted</b> transformers are among the components which have a significant contribution to the failures. Some interventions in the past have been tried, but the failure rate of transformers has not reduced to reasonable limits, thereby compromising the reliability of the distribution network. This research therefore tries to identify the causes of the high failure rate of transformers, the pattern of failure, areas where the failures are prevalent {{and what can be done}} to counter the root causes. Statistical data on the transformer failures was gathered over a period of four years, where on a daily basis, the number of failed transformers, weather conditions and time of day when the failures occurred were recorded. The weather conditions and time of day when the failures occurred made it easier to identify the possible causes of the failures. For instance, if there was a thunderstorm in a certain area and there were some failed units which were discovered immediately after the storm, then the failures of those units was attributed to lightning. Similarly, when there were no thunderstorms, but a transformer has failed windings, the likely cause of failure is overloading. After replacing that failed unit, its load was monitored to confirm overload and then take a corrective action. It is a standard practice that a failed transformer is replaced and the failed one taken for repairs and then later kept as a spare at the Swaziland Electricity Company. Basic tests on the failed transformers and visual inspections were carried out to determine the nature of damage on the failed unit, for instance, winding damage and bushing damage. Footing resistances were also recorded at the transformer structures and if there was a need, they were reduced to 10 Ω or less using the crowfoot earthing method or a combination of the crowfoot earthing method and conductive cement...|$|R
