Sketch writer O'Donoghue was worried that the sketch was too long and might not go over well with the audience.

25|$|At the party's 1981 convention, 33.5% of {{the delegates}} {{supported}} a leadership review; they felt that Clark {{would not be able}} to lead the party to victory again.

The fact that Clark had been able to increase his support among party members by only 0.4% was likely a contributing factor to his decision to resign as leader and seek a renewed mandate from the membership through a leadership convention. This was also considering that the governing Liberals under Pierre Trudeau were slipping in polls, and although the PCs had built up a substantial lead in popularity, Trudeau was expected to retire before the election and a new Liberal leader could have been able to <b>pull</b> <b>off</b> <b>a</b> victory.|$|E
