50|$|The {{end result}} of extreme {{receiver}} AFE sensitivity to high power levels is that, for most practical purposes, signal reception is impossible during <b>periods</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> associated transmitter is actually transmitting the dot and dash signals.

50|$|The {{behaviour}} of the Ouse and {{the conditions}} in its valley have been determined by its exit to the English Channel between Seaford and Newhaven.

5|$|Following World War I (a <b>period</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Machine Gun Corps {{was based}} in the park, as {{referred}} to in Henry Williamson's Chronicle of Ancient Sunlight), the Brownlows, like many of their peers, were faced with mounting financial problems.

By 1990 there was a choice to either close down the Zoo, or invest considerable funds and preserve it.

5|$|Money was {{allegedly}} lent by the banks {{to their employees}} and associates so they could buy shares in those same banks while simply using those same shares as collateral for the loans.

These same loans were then allegedly written off days before the banks collapsed.|$|E
5|$|Nyuserre {{is one of}} {{the very}} few Old Kingdom kings for whom there is {{evidence}} that the funerary cult continued uninterrupted during the First Intermediate <b>Period,</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> central authority of the pharaohs had broken down and the Egyptian state was in turmoil. The tombs of two priests Heryshefhotep I and II, who lived during this period, mention their roles and duties in the funerary establishment of Nyuserre, witnessing to the continuing existence of the official mortuary cult.|$|E
25|$|<b>When</b> {{discussing}} <b>the</b> {{history of}} rail transport in the Netherlands, one can roughly distinguish six eras, namely the period up to 1839, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> first plans {{were made for}} a railroad; <b>the</b> <b>period</b> 1840-1860, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> railroads experienced their early expansion; <b>the</b> <b>period</b> 1860-1890, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> government started to order {{the construction of new}} lines; <b>the</b> <b>period</b> 1890-1938, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> railroads were consolidated into two large railroads; <b>the</b> <b>period</b> 1938-1992, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Nederlandse Spoorwegen was granted a monopoly on rail transport; and finally the period from 1992 to <b>the</b> present, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Nederlandse Spoorwegen lost its monopoly.|$|R

5|$|The Church that Sigeberht {{had done}} so much to {{establish}} in East Anglia survived for two centuries, enduring 'evil times' (such as the <b>period</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> kingdom was under attack by the armies of Penda of Mercia).

5|$|The Mafia of Villalba was of {{relatively}} recent origin, {{as it did}} {{not go back to}} the 1860s, considered to be the <b>period</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Mafia emerged around Palermo.

5|$|The River Hull is a {{navigable river}} in the East Riding of Yorkshire in Northern England.

Following a <b>period</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Archbishops of York charged tolls for its use, it became a free navigation. The upper reaches became part of the Driffield Navigation from 1770, after which they were again subject to tolls, and the section within the city of Hull came under the {{jurisdiction}} of the Port of Hull, with the same result.|$|E
5|$|The final {{fight of}} Johnson's early period, {{during which the}} stake money was {{relatively}} low, was his comprehensive win over a ponderous fighter called Fry for a prize of 50guineas at Kingston.

This fight did not attract many supporters of the sport; it took place on 6June 1786 and was therefore during the <b>period</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> wealthy were away from London.|$|E
