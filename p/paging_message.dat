40|$|Several UE energy {{consumption}} optimization techniques {{have been proposed}} for Machine Type Communication (MTC) devices. Extended Discontinuous Reception (eDRX) in idle mode is one such technique wherein an UE in idle mode wakes up only during its Paging Occasion (PO) to monitor paging messages from eNodeB (eNB). The PO is located within a Paging frame (PF). The PF {{is a function of}} System Frame Number (SFN) cycle of eNB. The paging messages may be sent asynchronously from multiple eNBs to a UE. Due to asynchronous operation of eNBs, SFN takes on different values at a given point in time and therefore a <b>paging</b> <b>message</b> is transmitted at different points in time from different eNBs. Due to this SFN misalignment between eNBs, an idle mode UE might receive and respond to the same <b>paging</b> <b>message</b> from different eNBs and/or miss a PO and thus the <b>paging</b> <b>message.</b> Due to this spread in time of SFN and PO, the actual handling of <b>paging</b> <b>message</b> by the UE becomes inefficient leading to increased UE {{energy consumption}} and decreased reachability. These issues, resulting from paging handling, will get amplified further if DRX period is extended longer (eDRX). In this study, we investigate the impact of eDRX cycles and mobility related parameters such as UE speed, cell size and size of SFN misalignment between eNBs on UE energy consumption, use of network resources and UE reachability. Receiving and responding to the same <b>paging</b> <b>message</b> results in increased energy consumption for UE and increased signaling between UE and the network. Missing a PO results in delayed paging reception and hence decreases UE reachability. As the DRX cycle lengths are increased from existing maximum of 2. 56 seconds to 10. 24 seconds and beyond, we see a reduction in UE energy consumption by more than 90 %, but the network signaling and the delay to reach the UE increases linearly {{as a function of the}} DRX cycle length. We observe that the number of duplicate <b>paging</b> <b>message</b> receptions/missed POs is minuscule for DRX cycle lengths below 10. 24 sec. At DRX cycle length of 10. 24 seconds, UEs travelling across 500 m cell radius at speeds of 3, 50, 100 km/h the percentage of duplicate paging receptions are 0. 07, 0. 11, and 0. 15 respectively. This duplicate <b>paging</b> <b>message</b> reception increases the UE energy consumption by 2. 31, 6. 15 and 12 percent of the total energy units respectively. Similarly, UE misses nearly 0. 34, 0. 39, and 0. 405 percent of the total POs respectively. Depending on the number of consecutive PO misses, the UE reachability decreases. But by reducing the size of SFN misalignment between eNBs, we see that it’s possible to increase the reachability for UEs in eDRX. Further we have proposed solutions based on our analytical study to avoid duplicate <b>paging</b> <b>message</b> reception by UE, increase UE reachability and also reduce UE energy consumption using a windowing technique. We conclude that when a UE is configured with eDRX cycles, the tradeoff between battery lifetimes and UE reachability is based on mobility characteristics and service requirements...|$|E

In this paper, we propose a pre-backoff method to reduce the collision probability of random access requests.

However, no normative specification work on group issues took place. It may restart again in the next 3 GPP Release 13. In group paging, the base station, which is known as an evolved-NodeB (eNB) in 3 GPP, can assign a number of machine devices to form a paging group. The eNB can then simultaneously activate the group of machine devices by sending a single group <b>paging</b> <b>message.</b> Upon receiving the group <b>paging</b> <b>message,</b> all machine devices belonging to the paging group should immediately perform the random access (RA) procedure to access the network during a period of time, which is referred as a group paging interval herein [4].|$|E

We compare the total number of paging and false location update messages with the cost of the standard paging procedure. Fortunately, the false location update probabilities can be made very small, and important bandwidth gains can be expected.

40|$|Abstract—The {{universal}} {{mobile telecommunications}} system (UMTS) utilizes the discontinuous reception (DRX) mechanism {{to reduce the}} power consumption of mobile stations (MSs). DRX permits an idle MS to power off the radio receiver for a predefined sleep period and then wake up to receive the next <b>paging</b> <b>message.</b> The sleep/wake-up scheduling of each MS is determined by two DRX parameters: the inactivity timer threshold and the DRX cycle. In the literature, analytic and simulation models {{have been developed to}} study the DRX performance mainly for Poisson traffic. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-Markov process to model the UMTS DRX with bursty packet data traffic. The analytic results are validated against simulation experiments.

40|$|Abstract The {{integration}} of cellular and VoIP over WLAN (VoWLAN) systems recently has attracted considerable in-terest from both academia and industry. A cellular/VoWLAN dual-mode system enables users to access a low-cost VoIP service in a WLAN hotspot and {{switch to a}} wide-area cellular system without WLANs. Unfortunately, cellular/VoWLAN dual-mode mobiles suffer the power consumption problem that becomes {{one of the major}} concerns for commercial de-ployment of the dual-mode service. In this study, we present a novel power saving mechanism, called PIANO (paging via another radio), for the {{integration of}} heterogeneous wireless networks, and further apply the proposed methods to imple-ment a cellular/VoWLAN dual-mode system. Based on the proposed mechanisms, a dual-mode mobile can completely switch off its WLAN interface, only leaving the cellular interface awake to listen to paging messages. When a mo-bile receives a <b>paging</b> <b>message</b> from its cellular interface, it wakes up the WLAN interface and responds to connec-tion requests via WLAN networks. Therefore, a dual-mode mobile reduces the power consumption by turning off the WLAN interface during idle, and can also receive VoWLAN services. Measurement results based on the prototype system demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly extend the standby hours of a dual-mode mobile...|$|E
40|$|RRC layer {{specification}} {{is defined}} in TS 36. 331 [1], and for NB-IoT, the RRC layer specifications are slightly {{different from that of}} LTE. In general, RRC connection establishment for LTE and NB-IoT are relatively simple. RRC connection establishment is a 3 -way handshake between UE and eNodeB, which is used to make the transition of UE from RRC Idle mode to RRC Connected mode. UE must make the transition to RRC Connected mode before transferring any application data, or completing any signalling procedures. RRC connection establishment procedure has mainly 3 steps. RRC connection request message sent by UE, RRC connection setup sent by enodeB, RRC setup complete messages send by UE. The RRC connection establishment procedure is always initiated by the UE but can be triggered by either the UE or the network. For example, the UE triggers RRC connection establishment if the end-user starts an application to browse the internet, or to send an email. Similarly, the UE triggers RRC connection establishment if the UE moves into a new Tracking Area and has to complete the Tracking Area Update signalling procedure. The network triggers the RRC connection establishment procedure by sending a <b>Paging</b> <b>message.</b> This could be used to allow the delivery of an incoming SMS or notification of an incoming voice call. The initial Non-Access Stratum (NAS) message is transferred as part of the RRC connection es- tablishment procedure [2] to reduce connection establishment delay.
