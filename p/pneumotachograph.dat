Patient {{who have}} UARS typically show multiple EEG arousals during the sleep study and little to no polygraphic evidence of obstructive sleep apnea or decreased levels of oxygen.

Polysomnogram patterns must exhibit no evidence of apneas or hypopneas in order to be lead to a diagnosis of UARS. Even with polysomnography, diagnosis of UARS may be difficult because of insufficient means of measuring changes in airflow. This lack of sensitivity in detection may lead to misdiagnosis, as minor undetectable changes in airflow may still be responsible for the arousals. In order to definitively diagnose UARS, there must be a demonstrated pattern of greater negative esophageal pressures which are then followed by a rapid change to a more positive level with a sleep arousal. This can be confirmed with invasive polysomnography that uses an esophageal balloon transducer and full <b>pneumotachograph.</b>|$|E

The use of invalid spirometry equipment may have consequences on disease diagnosis and management of patients. OBJECTIVES: To establish the accuracy and precision of desktop spirometers that are routinely used in general practices. METHODS: We evaluated a random sample of 50 spirometers from Dutch general practices by testing them on a certified waveform generator using 8 standard American Thoracic Society waveforms to determine accuracy and precision. Details about the brand and type of spirometers, year of purchase, frequency of use, cleaning and calibration were inquired with a study-specific questionnaire. RESULTS: 39 devices (80 %) were turbine spirometers, 8 (16 %) were <b>pneumotachographs,</b> and 1 (2 %) was a volume displacement spirometer. Mean age of the spirometers was 4. 3 (SD 3. 7) years. Average deviation from the waveform generator reference values (accuracy) was 25 ml (95 % confidence interval 12 - 39 ml) for FEV(1) and 27 ml (10 - 45 ml) for FVC, but some devices showed substantial deviations. FEV(1) deviations were larger for <b>pneumotachographs</b> than for turbine spirometers (p < 0. 0031), but FVC deviations did not differ between the two types of spirometers. In the subset of turbine spirometers, no association between age and device performance was observed. CONCLUSIONS: On average, desktop spirometers in general practices slightly overestimated FEV(1) and FVC values, but some devices showed substantial deviations.

Blood was also sampled before and 21 days after the booster vaccination for circulating antibody titration. The peak VO 2, VCO 2, ventilatory equivalent (VE/VO 2) and oxygen pulse (VO 2 /HR) were significantly improved by the 3 -week training period. The other cardio-respiratory parameters as well as most of the blood parameters remained unchanged throughout the 4 SETs. The revaccination did not impair any of the parameters measured before, during, or after the SETs.

Respiratory airflow, tidal volume (V(T)), and respiratory frequency (f) were continuously recorded, using 2 ultrasonic <b>pneumotachographs</b> connected to a face mask and mass spectrometer. Oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide output, and expired minute volume (V(E)) were obtained on a breath by breath basis. Arterial blood was tested {{at the end of}} each step for O 2 and CO 2 partial pressures. Heart rate was continuously recorded, using a heart rate recording system. Stride frequency was measured at each step, and the stride frequency-to-f ratio was calculated. Venous blood was tested for plasma lactate concentration be fore and 2 minutes after completion of the test. Some horses had a locomotion-respiration coupling (LRC), but this coupling was occasional and intermittent. The f was lower and V(T) was higher than values reported for thoroughbreds working under similar experimental conditions. Nevertheless, maximal V(E) did not overshoot maximal V(E) reported in Thoroughbreds. All horses were hypoxemic and hypercapnic, but there was wide variability between subjects. The horses with the highest oxygen uptake and the lowest plasma lactate concentration were more hypoxemic and hypercapnic. The Standardbreds, studied under our laboratory conditions, did not have constant LRC and had lower f with higher V(T) than did Thoroughbreds under similar experimental conditions. Despite these differences in breathing strategy, the Standardbreds did not have higher V(E) than did Thoroughbreds, and they were hypoxemic and hypercapnic.

Five healthy fit Standardbred horses were investigated twice at 8 days interval, in TC and in HHC. Some measurements were made during a standardised treadmill exercise test (SET), others during a 1 h recovery period. The SET consisted of 8 min warm-up and 8 min exercise. During the SET, respiratory airflow and O 2 and CO 2 fraction in the respiratory gases were continuously recorded, using 2 ultrasonic <b>pneumotachographs</b> connected to a face mask and a mass spectrometer. Oxygen uptake (VO 2), carbon dioxide output, respiratory quotient and expired minute volume (VE) were obtained on a breath-by-breath basis. The maximal values obtained during the highest intensity of the SET and the values obtained 2 min after the end of the test were used for the comparison between both tests. Heart rate (HR) and skin temperature were continuously recorded, using a heart rate recording system and a real time infrared thermographic unit, respectively. After both SETs in TC and HHC, the horses recovered in TC. Heart rate, respiratory frequency (f) and rectal temperature were regularly measured during 1 h after the test. Venous blood was sampled after the completion of the test for biochemical analysis, namely plasma electrolytes and enzymatic activities. Exercising in HHC induced a reduction of the aerobic metabolism to the total energy requirement, i. e. a 20 % decrease of VO 2 and 55 % increase in lactate, as well as a decrease in VE. The increase in rectal and skin temperature, the dehydration and the weight loss were higher in HHC than in TC. During the recovery period the HR and f remained higher up to 30 min after the end of the SET in HHC while the rectal temperature remained higher up to 60 min after the end of this test. Therefore, despite the fact that our horses recovered in TC after exercising in HHC, there were significant differences between their physiological parameters measured during the recovery. This means that the recovery in air-conditioned unit would probably be an insufficient measure to ensure an adequate cooling of the horses and justify consequently the adaptations proposed by the Federation Equestre Internationale (FEI), i. e. the decrease of the distance of the run and the increase of the time devoted to the halt between phasesPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: High-frequency percussive {{ventilation}} (HFPV) is {{an increasingly}} used mode of mechanical ventilation, {{for which there}} is no proven real-time means of measuring delivered tidal volume (VT). OBJECTIVE: To validate a <b>pneumotachograph</b> for HFPV and then exploit flow-sensor data to describe the behavior of both low-frequency and high-frequency breaths. METH-ODS: Sensor performance was gauged during changes in high-frequency (4 – 12 Hz) and low...|$|E
30|$|Respiratory {{variables}} were monitored with the mixed expired procedure, employing an ergo-spirometry system (AMIS 2001 model C, Innovision A/S, Odense, Denmark) equipped with <b>pneumotachograph</b> to measure inspiratory flow. This system was calibrated with the standardized procedure described by Björklund et al. (2007, 2010). VO 2, VCO 2 and the inspired minute ventilation (VE) were monitored continuously {{and the average}} VO 2 during the final 30 s at each workload calculated.|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{inexpensive}} apparatus is described which permits the semi-automatic measurements of pulmonary dynamic compliance (Cdyn) and airway resistance (Raw) while rapid changes {{of these factors}} during the experimental induction of pneumopathies can be followed. A diaphragm {{is used as a}} <b>pneumotachograph</b> because it was found to be quite sensitive and pulmonary secretions did not disturb the measurements. Volume base line drift is prevented.
