The effects of six soil preparation methods on the vegetation cover, seedling survival, dominant seedling height and seedling establishment were studied up to four years after seedling emergence. The methods were: no preparation, ordinary ploughing, rotary cultivation, deep ploughing, soil inversion, removal of topsoil. Five additional treatments were applied: no treatment, herbicide, <b>peat</b> <b>litter,</b> wood ashes, slaked lime. Both a split-plot design and a {{randomised complete block design}} were used. Seedling survival and establishment without preparation, and with rotary cultivation, were close to nil, while the other soil preparation methods generally were more effective. Best seedling survival and establishment were obtained on seedbeds created by removing topsoil or by transposing it by deep ploughing or inversion. These seedbeds also suppressed competing vegetation, compared to seedbeds with topsoil at the surface. Seedling establishment after removal of topsoil, amounting to 8 % of sown germinable seed, was outstanding on sandy soil, but much poorer on silty soil. The tallest dominant seedlings were found on seedbeds with topsoil within the soil profile. Application of <b>peat</b> <b>litter</b> to the seedbed promoted seedling establishment...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationships}} of CO 2 {{emission to water}} table, peat moisture and humification were studied in a secondary peat swamp forest floor at the Vodoi National Park, Vietnam. Water table level is artificially maintained high and the forest floor is flooded {{for most of the}} year in order to reduce risks of fire. The lowest water table was at- 30 cm below the peat surface and the moisture of peat above the water table level was at the lowest 70 % w/w (from the 80 % water holding capacity). At these water tables CO 2 release from the peat surface was directly proportional to the water table level. The rate of CO 2 release from peat, excluding plant root respiration, was significantly higher and not clearly dependent on peat moisture content in the less humified topmost 10 cm <b>peat</b> (<b>litter)</b> layer compared to the more humified deeper peat. The highest CO 2 release rate from decomposition and faunal activity was found in the topmost 10 cm litter layer at a moisture content of 67 - 85 % w/w (from the 80 % water holding capacity). The CO 2 release rate below the litter layer was less than 0. 02 mg CO 2 g- 1 h- 1, and this decreased significantly when the water content was < 40 % of the water holding capacity. As the water table level in the forest floor never fell lower than- 30 cm from the ground surface and the moisture of peat above the water table was always above 80 % of water holding capacity, it was concluded that the near surface litter played the major role in CO 2 emission from peat in Vodoi National Park...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT In a {{study of}} turkeys over the period 0 to 3 wk of age, body weights of birds fed 5 or 15 % dietary peat or carrier-type feed {{byproducts}} (rice hulls, sunflower hulls, peanut hulls, soybean mill feed, wood flour, and corn cobs) were compared to those of turkeys fed a diet composed primarily of corn and soybean meal. Turkeys fed 15 % dietary peat or carriers showed a greater growth depression than those fed the diluents at the 5 % dietary level. At the 5 % peat or carrier level, growth was not significantly (P>, 05) depressed when birds were fed rice hulls (body weight was 98. 5 % of control), peat (97. 1 %), sunflower hulls (96. 9 %), and peanut hulls (95. 8 %); growth was significantly depressed (P<. 05) when birds were fed corn cobs (93. 1 %), soybean mill feed (92. 9 %), and wood flour (92. 8 %). Peat, when used as a drying agent for liquid agricultural byproducts, would account for 2 to 4 % of the diet. Results {{of this study suggest}} that peat as a carrier fed at the 5 % level would minimally affect growth. In a market study male turkeys were raised on floor pens containing peat or wood shavings and fed 0, 5, or 10 % reed-sedge peat as a diluent of a typical corn-soybean meal mash diet. Body weights of turkeys fed 5 or 10 % dietary peat showed a slight growth depression on both litter materials, compared with control. Higher body weights (nonsignificant) were observed for turkeys on wood shavings compared with those on <b>peat</b> <b>litter</b> after 12 wk of age. This possible weight difference may be due to the observed higher incidence of swollen foot pads in peat pens, thought to be caused by variable large peat sizes.

40|$|Peat mosses of {{the genus}} Sphagnum {{constitute}} the bulk of living and dead biomass in bogs. These plants contain peculiar polyphenols which hamper <b>litter</b> <b>peat</b> decomposition through their inhibitory activity on microbial breakdown. In {{the light of the}} increasing availability of biologically active nitrogen in natural ecosystems, litter derived from Sphagnum mosses is an ideal substrate to test the potential effects of increased atmospheric nitrogen deposition on polyphenol content in <b>litter</b> <b>peat.</b> To this aim, we measured total nitrogen and soluble polyphenol concentration in Sphagnum <b>litter</b> <b>peat</b> collected in 11 European bogs under a chronic gradient of atmospheric nitrogen deposition. Our results demonstrate that increasing nitrogen concentration in Sphagnum litter, as a consequence of increased exogenous nitrogen availability, is accompanied by a decreasing concentration of polyphenols. This inverse relationship is consistent with reports that in Sphagnum mosses, polyphenol and protein biosynthesis compete for the same precursor. Our observation of modified Sphagnum litter chemistry under chronic nitrogen eutrophication has implications {{in the context of the}} global carbon balance, because a lower content of decay-inhibiting polyphenols would accelerate <b>litter</b> <b>peat</b> decomposition...|$|R
40|$|Peatlands are an {{important}} component of the global carbon (C) cycle, accounting for around 20 - 30 % of global soil C. They accumulate C as long as the losses (through decomposition) are less than the inputs (through above- belowground litter production). In the UK, rain-fed blanket peatlands are the dominant peatland type, relying on a large precipitation excess over evaporation to create the waterlogged conditions that promote peat accumulation. This potentially makes them highly sensitive to the effects of climate change. Understanding the sensitivity of blanket <b>peat</b> <b>litter</b> decomposition to climate change is, therefore, of great importance to understand future stability of C stocks, particularly to parameterise dynamic peatland C models. However, to date, there have been relatively few studies of decomposition on blanket peat. In this thesis, a number of experiments primarily focussed on decomposition were carried out with realistic climate treatments simulated in the laboratory and across gradients analogous to near future climate change. The intention was to allow a more accurate quantification of the effects of climate change on peat decomposition processes under ‘realistic’ climatic treatments. By using field sites that lie at the margin of the climatic envelope associated with blanket peatlands, in the south west (SW) of England, we also sought to get a better understanding of how rates of decomposition in other, more northern, blanket peatlands in the UK might be affected by future climate change. A clear finding was that the rate of decomposition varied significantly between different litter types, suggesting {{an important}} indirect effect of climate change – shifting vegetation communities – could be one of the most important factors affecting future C accumulation. Despite clear differences in peat temperature between the sites along the altitudinal gradient (330 – 520 m asl), this did not translate into a corresponding reduction in decomposition rate. It appears that other environmental factors (such as increased nitrogen deposition) could be counteracting the effect of decreased temperature, or that peatland litter decomposition rates are relatively insensitive to temperature. That the decomposition did not decrease with altitude also suggests that productivity could be more important in controlling net peat accumulation, potentially increasing with altitude in response to factors such as N deposition. This could have ramifications for the future C balance of these systems, but further work is needed to disentangle the effects of climate from other environmental drivers and determine the balance between productivity and decomposition...|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} the development of three major forms of peat processing by the manufacturing industry in The Netherlands since {{the last quarter of}} the 19 th century. At a time when peat as a fuel was gradually being replaced by coal, the first form was the <b>peat</b> moss <b>litter</b> industry. <b>Peat</b> moss <b>litter</b> was made from white peat that was ground and sieved in factories which were located mainly in bog areas in the south-east of the province of Drenthe. It served as excellent bedding for horses and cattle. The second form of industrial peat processing was the manufacture, from 1921 onwards, of active carbon made from black peat. The Purit (Norit) factory, now part of the Cabot Corporation, is still the only active carbon factory using peat as a raw material. The third form of peat processing was the production of garden peat and potting soil. This is still a widespread activity in peat areas all over the world. The <b>peat</b> moss <b>litter</b> industry thrived from the 1880 s until shortly after the First World War. The arrival of the horse-drawn tram in all of the major cities of Europe created a great demand for animal bedding to be used in the vast stables of the tramway companies. <b>Peat</b> moss <b>litter</b> was cleaner, healthier and easier to handle than straw. There was similar demand from the armies, which used millions of horses during the First World War. Owing to the development of motorised vehicles, the peat market collapsed after the war and this plunged the industry into a prolonged crisis which was not overcome until peat was found to be a suitable growing medium for horticulture in the 1950 s. Living and working conditions in peatlands were harsh, earnings irregular and labourers’ rights limited. The peat manufacturing industry was the first to introduce collective labour agreements, medical benefits and pension plans. Nonetheless massive unemployment, poverty and the necessity to migrate to other parts of the country were clear signs that the era of peat was over for all but a handful of labourers...|$|R
5000|$|In 1896, the British <b>Peat</b> Moss <b>Litter</b> {{company was}} formed by the {{amalgamation}} of the Hatfield Chase <b>Peat</b> Moss <b>Litter</b> Company {{and most of the}} companies working on Thorne Moors.

The wooden baling presses were destroyed, but were replaced with steel presses, which were powered by a [...] stationary steam engine which burned peat as its fuel. Besides the canals and the aqueduct, the 1906 Ordnance Survey maps show two swing bridges, one on the northern section just beyond the junction where the line for the southern section turned off, and another where that line crossed the Cottage Dike.

40|$|Peat bogs have {{historically}} represented exceptional carbon (C) sinks {{because of their}} extremely low decomposition rates and consequent accumulation of plant remnants as peat. Among the factors favoring that peat accumulation, a major role is played by the chemical quality of plant litter itself, which is poor in nutrients and characterized by polyphenols with a strong inhibitory effect on microbial breakdown. Because bogs receive their nutrient supply solely from atmospheric deposition, the global increase of atmospheric nitrogen (N) inputs {{as a consequence of}} human activities could potentially alter the litter chemistry with important, but still unknown, effects on their C balance. Here we present data showing the decomposition rates of recently formed <b>litter</b> <b>peat</b> samples collected in nine European countries under a natural gradient of atmospheric N deposition from ¿ 0. 2 to 2 g·m- 2. yr - 1.

The increased N availability favored microbial decomposition (i) by removing N constraints on microbial metabolism and (ii) through a chemical amelioration of <b>litter</b> <b>peat</b> quality with a positive feedback on microbial enzymatic activity.

Total and heterotrophic soil respiration were monitored over 13 months in paired control and trenched plots. Spatial variability was taken into account by differentiating hummocks from hollows in the forest; close to palm from far from palm positions in the plantations.

Interactions between vascular plants and Sphagnum are concluded to be less important than those between hepatics and other bryophytes, which appear with several positive or negative associations. Narthecium ossifragum supports the growth of Sphagnum, whereas the vascular plant suffers from the competition for light with the peat mosses. The intensity of this competition may be higher at sites more favourable to N. ossifragum. However, interactions between the vascular plant and Sphagnum are less important to structuring vegetation than edaphic factors, particularly on less productive sites. Similar to other plant taxocenes, mire hepatic species highly vary in their ecological amplitudes and preferences. Hepatics make use of the mire habitat with two different strategies. Some species, e. g. Aneura pinguis and Cladopodiella fluitans, compromise between benefiting habitats created by other living bryophytes and keeping pace with their growth. Other hepatics, e. g. Calypogeia integristipula and Cephalozia connivens, instead avoid growing among mosses and frequently occupy <b>peat</b> or <b>litter.</b> Mostly sterile Cephalozia spp. frequently grow among Sphagnum, whereas those commonly fertile keep away from peat mosses...|$|R
40|$|Peat bogs have {{accumulated}} more atmospheric carbon (C) {{than any other}} terrestrial ecosystem today. Most of this C is associated with <b>peat</b> moss (Sphagnum) <b>litter.</b> Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition can decrease Sphagnum production, compromising the C sequestration capacity of peat bogs. The mechanisms underlying the reduced production are uncertain, necessitating multifactorial experiments. • We investigated whether glasshouse experiments are reliable proxies for field experiments for assessing interactions between N deposition and environment as controls on Sphagnum N concentration and production. We performed a meta-analysis over 115 glasshouse experiments and 107 field experiments. • We found that glasshouse and field experiments gave similar qualitative and quantitative estimates of changes in Sphagnum N concentration in response to N application. However, glasshouse-based estimates of changes in production - even qualitative assessments - diverged from field experiments owing to a stronger N effect on production response in absence of vascular plants in the glasshouse, and a weaker N effect on production response in presence of vascular plants compared to field experiments. • Thus, although we need glasshouse experiments to study how interacting environmental factors affect the response of Sphagnum to increased N deposition, we need field experiments to properly quantify these effects. © 2012 The Authors.

40|$|This {{study used}} thermogravimetric {{analysis}} (TGA) {{to study the}} transit of organic C through a peatland ecosystem. The biomass, <b>litter,</b> <b>peat</b> soil profile, particulate organic matter (POM), and dissolved organic matter (DOM) fluxes were sampled from the Moor House National Nature Reserve, a peat-covered catchment in northern England where both the dry matter and carbon budget for the catchment were known. The study showed that although TGA traces showed distinct differences between organic matter reservoirs and fluxes, the traces could not readily be associated with particular functionalities or elemental properties. The TGA trace shows that polysaccharides are preferentially removed by humification and degradation with residual peat being dominated by lignin compositions. The DOM {{is derived from the}} degradation of lignin while the POM is derived from erosion of the peat profile. The carbon lost as gases (CO 2 and CH 4) was estimated to be composed of 92 to 95 % polysaccharide carbon. The composition of the organic matter lost from the peat ecosystem means that the oxidative ratio (OR) of the ecosystem experienced by the atmosphere was between 0. 96 and 0. 99 : currently, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change uses an OR value of 1. 1 for all ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|To clarify seedbank {{developmental}} {{pattern and}} its determinants, we examined relationships between seedbank, standing vegetation, and litter in a post-mined peatland on Sarobetsu Mire, northern Japan. In late fall 2006 {{and early summer}} 2007, peat was sampled from four vegetation types, and litter was also sampled from {{two of the four}} vegetation where thick litter was accumulated. Seed germination tests were performed by the samples in a glasshouse. The results were compared to the standing vegetation and litter accumulation. Seed density and species richness in seedbank gradually increased with increasing vegetation cover. Seeds in surface layer germinated more in fall than in summer. In vegetation with thick litter, small seeds, such as Drosera rotundifolia and Gentiana triflora, germinated more from <b>peat</b> than from <b>litter</b> in summer, probably due to the downward movement. Seed density in litter decreased from fall to the next summer. Moliniopsis japonica and Rhynchospora alba developed short-term persistent seedbank, whereas D. rotundifolia and G. triflora preserved long-term persistent seedbank in peat covered with thick litter. Seedbank development follows the development of the standing vegetation with litter. Litter derived from the standing vegetation is a prime determinant on the seedbank composition and development, by acting as seed trap and keeping seed dormancy...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compares the}} organic {{chemistry}} of peat beneath one of last remaining pristine tropical peat forests in Southeast Asia with a neighbouring peat dome {{that has been}} deforested, but not intentionally drained, in the Belait district of Brunei Darussalam, Borneo. We characterized the solid and dissolved organic matter collected from the two domes, {{through a combination of}} methods including elemental analysis, phenolic content and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) investigation of solid peat, as well as optical characterisation (absorbance, fluorescence) of dissolved organic matter (DOM). The peat had a high content of lignin, consistent with its origin from the Shorea albida trees on the domes. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration in the pore water was significantly greater in the deforested site (79. 9 ± 5. 5 mg l[superscript − 1]) than the pristine site (62. 2 ± 2. 2 mg l[superscript − 1]). The dissolved organic matter was richer in nitrogen and phenolics in the deforested site. The optical properties (Fluorescence Index) indicated a modification of DOM cycling in the deforested site (enhanced decomposition of the <b>peat</b> and fresh <b>litter).</b> Comparison of the solid peat composition between the two sites also suggests effects of deforestation: sulphur, nitrogen and phenolic contents were higher in the deforested site. Taken together, these observations are consistent with peat enhanced decomposition in the deforested site, even without engineered drainage. Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology.

40|$|The {{chemical}} properties of surface peat cover (SPC) were {{studied in the}} context of Estonian pedoecological conditions. SPC comprises the superficial layers of fens (Group 1) and transitional bogs (Group 2), together with slightly acid peaty mull / strongly acid peaty moder (Group 3) and very strongly acid peaty mor (Group 4) layers overlying mineral soils. Thus, it spans organic soils, namely Histosols (Groups 1 and 2); together with Histic Gleysols (Group 3) and Histic Podzols (Group 4), which are developmentally intermediate between organic and mineral soils. Moderately acid eutrophic (Group 1) and very strongly acid mesotrophic (Group 2) <b>peats</b> (forest <b>litter</b> layers excluded) were uniformly characterised up to 40 cm depth; whereas for Groups 3 and 4 we examined the full thickness of available peat layers, which ranged from 10 to 30 cm. The results show that Al, K and heavy metal contents are significantly higher and organic carbon content is lower in Histic Soils (3, 4) than in Histosols (1, 2). The amounts of Ca, Mg, Mn and Fe are significantly higher and C:N ratio, exchangeable acidity and content of free H+ lower in less acidic (1, 3) than in more acidic (2, 4) soil types. The total concentration of elements (excluding heavy metals) extracted by nitro-hydrochloric acid (aqua regia) is considerably higher in less acidic soils, at 28 – 45 g kg- 1 (1, 3) versus 10 – 12 g kg- 1 (2, 4); and mean contents of individual elements decrease in the order Ca(51 %) > Fe(20 %) > S(10 %) ≥ Al(10 %) > Mg(3 %) ≥ P(3 %) > K(2 %) > Mn(1 %) > Na(< 1 %). The most abundant heavy metals are Pb (12 – 33 mg kg- 1), Zn (7 – 41 mg kg- 1), Cu (3 – 12 mg kg- 1), Cr (2 – 23 mg kg- 1) and Ni (2 – 8 mg kg- 1); Cd and Hg contents are very low, ranging from 0. 2 to 0. 5 mg kg- 1. The dominant exchangeable basic cations are Ca 2 + (78 – 93 %) and Mg 2 + (7 – 15 %), and the peat contains much smaller amounts of K+ (1 – 6 %) and Na+ (< 2 %). The total exchangeable acidic cations (1 – 14 cmol kg- 1) are dominated by H+ (51 – 83 %) and Al 3 + (15 – 47 %), whereas Mn and Fe (2 – 4 %) cations are modestly represented...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} soils and plant covers was {{conducted}} on the coastal plains of the western province of Saudi Arabia to clarify the relationships between the soil properties and the plant cover type. A belt transect of 80 m in length was established across each study area. Four mixed plant communities dominated by species such as: Tamarix nilotica in coastal sabkha, Saliconrnia qassimensis in coastal sand dunes, Aerva lanata in sand plains, and Bassia muricata in wadis areas were recognized. Soil types at the study area were determined to be sandy immature soil and peat lamina soil. Their horizon sequences were described as surface, subsurface and bottom layers, indicating layers of leaf <b>litter,</b> <b>peat</b> lamina and parent material, respectively. Coastal sabkha and coastal sand dunes were characterized by a relatively high calcium concentration in the soil horizons and tendency for podzolization in the volcanic deposit layer. The subsurface layers in coastal sabkha and coastal sand dunes were characterized by some peat lamina accumulation because of the high groundwater table, volcanic deposits in the soil profile and the strong influence of sea salt on the soil chemistry. The roots in the coastal sabkha and coastal sand dunes were distributed more shallowly than those in the sand plains and wadi areas, thus avoiding the high water table level as well as the influence of seawater in the soil. Generally, the salt marsh showed high sodium concentration and base saturation, indicating that this area was directly affected by seawater. Recently, the periphery of the plant covers on the coastal sand dunes has been declining because inundation caused by ground subsidenc...|$|R
