25|$|The tarsus {{of insects}} {{corresponds}} to the penultimate segment of a generalized arthropod limb, which is the segment called the propodite in Crustacea. adult insects it is commonly subdivided into from two to five subsegments, or tarsomeres, but in the Protura, some Collembola, and most holometabolous insect larvae it preserves the primitive form of a simple segment. The subsegments of the adult insect tarsus are usually freely movable on one another by inflected connecting membranes, but the tarsus never has intrinsic muscles. The tarsus of adult pterygote insects having fewer than five subsegments is probably specialized {{by the loss of}} one or more subsegments or by a fusion of adjoining subsegments. In the tarsi of Acrididae the long basal piece is evidently composed of three united tarsomeres, leaving the fourth and the fifth. The basal tarsomere is sometimes conspicuously enlarged and is distinguished as the basitarsus. On the under surfaces of the tarsal subsegments in certain Orthoptera there are small pads, the tarsal pulvilli, or euplantulae. The tarsus is occasionally fused with the tibia in larval insects, forming a tibiotarsal segment; in some cases it appears to be eliminated or reduced to a rudiment between the tibia and the <b>pretarsus.</b>|$|E
25|$|The typical and usual {{segments}} of the insect leg are divided into the coxa, one trochanter, the femur, the tibia, the tarsus, and the <b>pretarsus.</b> The coxa in its more symmetrical form, has {{the shape of a}} short cylinder or truncate cone, though commonly it is ovate and may be almost spherical. The proximal end of the coxa is girdled by a submarginal basicostal suture that forms internally a ridge, or basicosta, and sets off a marginal flange, the coxomarginale, or basicoxite. The basicosta strengthens the base of the coxa and is commonly enlarged on the outer wall to give insertion to muscles; on the mesal half of the coxa, however, it is usually weak and often confluent with the coxal margin. The trochanteral muscles that take their origin in the coxa are always attached distal to the basicosta. The coxa is attached to the body by an articular membrane, the coxal corium, which surrounds its base. These two articulations are perhaps the primary dorsal and ventral articular points of the subcoxo-coxal hinge. In addition, the insect coxa has often an anterior articulation with the anterior, ventral end of the trochantin, but the trochantinal articulation does not coexist with a sternal articulation. The pleural articular surface of the coxa is borne on a mesal inflection of the coxal wall. If the coxa is movable on the pleural articulation alone, the coxal articular surface is usually inflected to a sufficient depth to give a leverage to the abductor muscles inserted on the outer rim of the coxal base. Distally the coxa bears an anterior and a posterior articulation with the trochanter. The outer wall of the coxa is often marked by a suture extending from the base to the anterior trochanteral articulation. In some insects the coxal suture falls in line with the pleural suture, and in such cases the coxa appears to be divided into two parts corresponding to the episternum and epimeron of the pleuron. The coxal suture is absent in many insects.|$|E

5000|$|The ancestral tarsus was {{a single}} segment and in the extant Protura, Diplura and certain insect larvae the tarsus also is single-segmented. Most modern insects have tarsi divided into subsegments (tarsomeres), usually about five. The actual number varies with the taxon, which may be useful for {{diagnostic}} purposes. For example, the Pterogeniidae characteristically have 5-segmented fore- and mid-tarsi, but 4-segmented hind tarsi, whereas the Cerylonidae have four tarsomeres on each tarsus. The distal segment of the typical insect leg is the <b>pretarsus.</b> In the Collembola, Protura and many insect larvae, the <b>pretarsus</b> is a single claw. On the <b>pretarsus</b> most insects have a pair of claws unguis, plural ungues. Between the ungues a median unguitractor plate supports the <b>pretarsus.</b> The plate {{is attached to the}} apodeme of the flexor muscle of the ungues. In the Neoptera the parempodia are a symmetrical pair of structures arising from the outside (distal) surface of the unguitractor plate between the claws. It is present in many Hemiptera and almost all Heteroptera. Usually the parempodia are bristly (setiform), but in a few species they are fleshy. [...] Sometimes the parempodia are reduced in size so as to almost disappear. [...] Above the unguitractor plate the <b>pretarsus</b> expands forward into a median lobe, the arolium.|$|E

50|$|A {{tarantula}} {{has four}} pairs of legs and two additional pairs of appendages. Each leg has seven segments which, from the prosoma out, are: coxa, trochanter, femur, patella, tibia, tarsus and <b>pretarsus,</b> and claw. Two or three retractable claws {{are at the}} end of each leg. These claws are used to grip surfaces for climbing. Also on the end of each leg, surrounding the claws, is a group of hairs. These hairs, called the scopula, help the tarantula to grip better when climbing surfaces like glass. The fifth pair are the pedipalps which aid in feeling, gripping prey, and mating in the case of a mature male. The sixth pair of appendages are the chelicerae and their attached fangs. When walking, a tarantula's first and third leg on one side move at the same time as the second and fourth legs on the other side of his body. The muscles in a tarantula's legs cause the legs to bend at the joints, but to extend a leg, the tarantula increases the pressure of haemolymph entering the leg.|$|E

50|$|Banks Peninsula tree weta is a red-brown colour (Biodiversity Recovery Unit, 1998) {{its body}} length {{can range from}} 40-55 mm in mature adults and it weighs 4-6 g. Like other insects Banks Peninsula tree weta has three body segments, a head, a thorax and an abdomen. The head of the mature male Banks Peninsula tree weta is much larger and darker than that of females or {{juvenile}} males with large mandibles that they use to fight other males. The two eyes are situated {{on the front of}} its head with two antennae protruding from the inside margin of these. The antennae can be much longer than the body length, and these are covered with hairs which are able to sense activity. Banks Peninsula tree weta also has three ocelli, or simple eyes, between its eyes which respond to changes in light. The thorax contains the front, middle and hind legs of the weta, each leg is made up of six segments; the coxa, the trochanter, the femur, the tibia, the tarsus and the <b>pretarsus.</b> The ear of the weta {{can be found at the}} top of the tibia near the knee joint of the front legs. The tibia of the hind legs are covered in spines, that can be rubbed against the stridulatory ridges on the side of the body to produce a sound, these can also be used as a defence mechanism against predators. Banks Peninsula tree weta can be distinguished from other types of weta as they have 20 or more stridulatory ridges. The hind legs are also very muscular for the purpose of jumping, however Banks Peninsula tree weta is too heavy to jump. The abdomen is broken up into segments, called spiracles, and it is here we find the stridulatory ridges. Protruding from the abdomen is the cerci, which is used to pick up vibrations in the air. Females also have an ovipositor, a long tube like cylinder used to deposit eggs in the soil.|$|E

5000|$|Arthropods {{make use}} of smooth {{adhesive}} pads as well as hairy pads for climbing and locomotion along non-horizontal surfaces. Both types of pads in insects {{make use of}} liquid secretions and are considered 'wet'. [...] adhesive mechanisms primarily rely on van der Waals’ forces and are also used by organisms other than insects. [...] The fluid provides capillary and viscous adhesion {{and appears to be}} present in all insect adhesive pads. [...] Little is known about the chemical properties of the adhesive fluids and the ultrastructure of the fluid producing cells is currently not extensively studied. Additionally, both hairy and smooth types of adhesion have evolved separately numerous times in insects. Few comparative studies between the two types of adhesion mechanisms have been done and {{there is a lack of}} information regarding the forces that can be supported by these systems in insects. [...] Additionally, tree frogs and some mammals such as the arboreal possum and bats also make use of smooth adhesive pads. The use of adhesive pads for locomotion across non-horizontal surfaces is a trait that evolved separately in different species, making it an example of convergent evolution. The power of adhesion allows these organisms to be able to climb on almost any substance. [...] The exact mechanisms of arthropod adhesion are still unknown for some species but this topic is of great importance to biologists, physicists and engineers. [...] These highly specialized structures are not restricted to one particular area of the leg. They may be located on different parts, such as claws, derivatives of the <b>pretarsus,</b> tarsal apex, tarsomeres or tibia. From the scaling analysis, it has been suggested that animal lineages relying on the dry adhesion, such as lizards and spiders have a higher density of terminal contact elements compared to systems that use wet adhesive mechanisms such as insects. Since these effects are based on fundamental physical principles and highly related to the shape of the structure, they are also the same for artificial surfaces with similar geometry. [...] Adhesion and friction forces per-unit-pad area were very similar in smooth and hairy systems when tested. Strong adhesion may be beneficial in many situations but it also can create difficulties in locomotion. [...] Direction-dependence is an important and fundamental property of adhesive structures that are able to rapidly and controllably adhere during locomotion. Researchers are unsure whether direction-dependence is achieved through changes in contact area or through a change in shear stress. [...] Friction and adhesion forces in most animal attachment organs are higher when they are pulled towards the body than when they push away from it. This has been observed in geckos and spiders but also in the smooth adhesive pads of ants, bush-crickets and cockroaches. [...] Adhesive hairs of geckos are non-symmetrical and feature distally pointing setae and spatulae that are able to generate increased friction and adhesion when aligned with a proximal pull. The adhesive hairs of some beetles behave similarly to those of geckos. While directional-dependence is present in other animals, it has yet to be confirmed in insects with hairy adhesive pads.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe distal {{region of}} the Drosophila leg, the tarsus, is divided into five {{segments}} (ta I–V) and terminates in the <b>pretarsus,</b> which {{is characterized by a}} pair of claws. Several homeobox genes are expressed in distinct regions of the tarsus, including aristaless (al) and lim 1 in the <b>pretarsus,</b> Bar (B) in ta IV and V, and apterous (ap) in ta IV. This pattern is governed by regulatory interactions between these genes; for example, Al and B are mutually antagonistic resulting in exclusion of B expression from the <b>pretarsus.</b> Although Al is necessary, it is not sufficient to repress B, indicating another factor is required. Here, this factor is identified as the product of the C 15 gene, which is another homeodomain protein, a homolog of the human Hox 11 oncogene. C 15 is expressed in the same cells as al and, together, C 15 and Al appear to directly repress B. C 15 /Al also act indirectly to repress ap in ta V, i. e., in surrounding cells. To do this, C 15 /Al autonomously repress expression of the gene encoding the Notch ligand Delta (Dl) in the <b>pretarsus,</b> restricting Dl to ta V and creating a Dl+/Dl− border at the interface between ta V and the <b>pretarsus.</b> This results in upregulation of Notch signaling, which induces expression of the bowl gene, the product of which represses ap...|$|E
