5000|$|All {{copper pipe}} in Australia are {{referenced}} to their DN (diamètre nominal) number, {{which is the}} closest metric equivalent to a <b>pipe's</b> Imperial <b>size.</b> For example, DN20 is the <b>size</b> for copper <b>pipe</b> with an outside diameter of 19.05 mm or 3/4 inches.

5000|$|Sleeves must be sized such as to {{adequately}} allow {{the passage of}} the intended penetrant(s) plus enough room to permit the practical installation and mounting of the penetrants as well as adequate room for firestops. A general practice is to size the sleeve two NPS (<b>pipe</b> <b>sizes)</b> up from the diameter of the penetrant. For example, a 4" [...] pipe, with 1" [...] of thermal insulation makes a 6" [...] penetrant (1" [...] pipe covering {{on each side of the}} pipe), plus two <b>pipe</b> <b>sizes</b> = an 8" [...] sleeve, creating a 1" [...] annulus.|$|R

50|$|The {{design of}} a system is governed by {{multiple}} criteria, one being cost. If the benefit is fixed, the least cost design results in maximum benefit. However, the least cost approach normally results in a minimum capacity for a water supply network. A minimum cost model usually searches for the least cost solution (in <b>pipe</b> <b>sizes),</b> while satisfying the hydraulic constraints such as: required output pressures, maximum pipe flow rate and pipe flow velocities. The cost {{is a function of}} pipe diameters; therefore the optimization problem consists of finding a minimum cost solution by optimising <b>pipe</b> <b>sizes</b> to provide the minimum acceptable capacity.|$|R

5000|$|The terms [...] "pipe" [...] and [...] "tube" [...] {{are almost}} interchangeable, {{although}} minor distinctions exist [...] - [...] generally, a tube has tighter engineering requirements than a pipe. Both {{pipe and tube}} imply a level of rigidity and permanence, whereas a hose is usually portable and flexible. A tube and pipe may be specified by standard <b>pipe</b> <b>size</b> designations, e.g., nominal <b>pipe</b> <b>size,</b> or by nominal outside or inside diameter and/or wall thickness. The actual dimensions of pipe are usually not the nominal dimensions: A 1-inch pipe will not actually measure 1 inch in either outside or inside diameter, whereas many types of tubing are specified by actual inside diameter, outside diameter, or wall thickness.|$|E

40|$|A two part {{optimisation}} study using the computer search technique of Genetic Algorithm optimisation {{has been carried}} out for the Gold Coast area. The study covered ten water supply zones from Nerang South to Coolangatta. Part one of the study focussed on three water supply zones.

Part two focussed on the transmission mains for all ten water supply zones in the area.

5000|$|Nominal <b>Pipe</b> <b>Size</b> (NPS) is a North American set of {{standard}} sizes for pipes used for {{high or low}} pressures and temperatures. [...] "Nominal" [...] refers to pipe in non-specific terms and identifies {{the diameter of the}} hole with a non-dimensional number (for example - [...] "2-inch nominal steel pipe" [...] consists of many varieties of steel pipe with the only criterion being a 2.375 inch outside diameter). Specific pipe is identified by pipe diameter and another non-dimensional number for wall thickness referred to as the Schedule (Sched. or Sch., for example - [...] "2 inch diameter pipe, Schedule 40"). NPS is often incorrectly called National <b>Pipe</b> <b>Size,</b> due to confusion with national pipe thread (NPT). The European and international designation equivalent to NPS is DN (diamètre nominal/nominal diameter/Durchmesser nach Norm), in which sizes are measured in millimetres, see ISO 6708. The term NB (nominal bore) is also frequently used interchangeably with NPS.|$|E
