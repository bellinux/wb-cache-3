Although successful, the impact on grind size, added downstream grinding and media consumption, and added OPEX is barely noted - providing a biased view of benefits. Alternatives that provide sound mineral processing routes, provide on-line mill control and are markedly cheaper to operate are presented as a potentially more viable and sensible route for both future installations and current expansions...|$|E
40|$|Cement {{production}} is an energy intensive process that consumes {{a significant portion}} of world energy. Production costs and environmental concerns are driving the need to use less energy. Up to 40 % of total energy for cement {{production is}} consumed to obtain the final cement product by dry grinding the cement clinker. Significant optimisation of the traditional cement grinding process can be achieved. Grinding process modelling and simulation methods can be used for the process optimisation. A simulation study conducted using the data from an industrial cement plant indicate that <b>pre-crushing</b> of cement clinker using a Barmac crusher offers realistic benefits to a cement plant. The energy consumption can be reduced in order of 10 - 15 %. Alternatively, throughput increases in the same order can be achieved...|$|E
40|$|Two {{methods of}} <b>pre-crushing</b> power, {{hydrogen}} decrepitation (HD) and mechanical crushing (MC), {{were applied to}} prepare Sm (CobalFe 0. 28 Cu 0. 06 Zr 0. 02) (7. 84) magnets. Their microstructures and magnetic properties were investigated. Compared with a conventional MC method, the Sm 2 O 3 content was decreased and the coercivity was enhanced from 8. 67 to 24. 03 kOe with an HD method. The larger grain size and less grain boundaries defects were obtained in HD magnets. In addition, the HD technology improved effective Sm content of magnets by decreasing oxidation of Sm. The effective Sm content {{played a significant role}} on microstructure and magnetic properties changes of the two kinds of magnets. In combinations with the changes of alloy composition and microstructures, the effect of HD technology on effective Sm content was discussed...|$|E

50|$|The {{grinding}} stock is fed to the mill via an inlet box and is <b>pre-crushed</b> by the tools {{on top of}} the rotor. The precrushing tools also carry the product into the milling zone {{at the side of the}} rotor. There the {{grinding stock}} is fluidised in the air stream between rotor and stator caused by rotation and the U-shaped grinding tools. The special design of these tools creates massive air whirls in the grinding zone (this is where the name of the mill comes from). These air whirls cause the main grinding effect. The particles collide with each other in these whirlwinds. The final particle size can be adjusted by changing the clearance between rotor and stator, air flow and rotor speed.|$|R

40|$|The current world {{consumption}} of cement is about 1. 5 billion {{tonnes per annum}} and it is increasing at about 1 % per annum. The electrical energy consumed in cement production is approximately 110 kWh/tonne, and around 40 % of this energy is consumed for clinker grinding. There is potential to optimise conventional cement clinker grinding circuits {{and in the last}} decade significant progress has been achieved. The increasing demand for “finer cement ” products, and the need for reduction in energy consumption and green house gas emissions, reinforces the need for grinding optimisation. This paper describes the tools available for the analysis and optimisation of cement grinding circuits. The application of the Bond based methodology as well as Population Balance Models (PBM) is presented using a case study. The throughput of current conventional closed grinding circuit can be increased by 10 - 20 % by <b>pre-crushing</b> the clinker using the Barmac crusher.

40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{generate}} {{a deeper understanding of}} the mechanical behaviour of cellular materials, specifically for their use in aerospace applications. A closed-cell polymer foam material (Rohacell) of various foam densities was chosen for this investigation, and a comprehensive experimental study was conducted which generated significant findings that hitherto have not been reported in the literature. The research presented in this study revealed the following: The quasistatic response of Rohacell foam displays a compression/tension asymmetry in moduli and strength. In-situ experiments revealed that different macroscopic collapse mechanisms at different foam densities drove this behaviour. Improved experimental methods were developed to characterise the material response at various loading rates. Under compressive loading, as the relative density and loading rate increased, a transition in material behaviour from a ductile to brittle response at very high rates (~ 5 x 10 ^ 3 s^- 1) was found, and tests conducted at different temperatures were used to validate and provide a better understanding of the causes for the observed rate dependency. The compression and tension properties of pre-crushed Rohacell foam loaded in different directions were measured, and with the use of three-point-bend tests it was shown that when the foams’ tension/compression asymmetry, or the changes in stiffness and strength due to <b>pre-crushing</b> (i. e. strain-induced anisotropy), are neglected, this leads to incorrect predictions of the foams’ structural response. Finally, a review of some existing Finite Element foam material models was conducted, and their ability to predict the foam response under complex loading was identified. The new data and understanding generated from this thesis will allow engineers and researchers, who are developing constitutive models for predicting the response of foam materials, specifically in aerospace applications, to account for more aspects of the mechanical behaviours in their Finite Element models.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{elementary}} behaviour of granular materials strongly {{depends on}} micro- structural and geometrical changes from grain crushing. This paper proposes a 2 D discrete element numerical {{model for the}} investigation of brittle granular crushing in confined uniaxial compression conditions. While our analysis adopts the well established strategy of replacing <b>pre-crushed</b> particles by post-fractured fragments, our model {{is based on a}} refined fracture criterion that accounts for: (1) the Weibull statistics of the tensile strengths, (2) the effects of the coordination number and (3) the curvature of the loading particles. Further refinements enable the current model to conserve mass and to extend the contrast between the fragment sizes as they evolve. Given these technical achievements, the scientific purpose of the paper is to test the prevailing assumption that confined uniaxial compression of granular material is leaded towards an ultimate fractal grain size distribution (gsd) : in particular, we question whether the system tends towards a power-law gradation and self-similar topology. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{product to}} be {{processed}} is fed to the mill centrally via an inlet box {{at the top and}} is <b>pre-crushed</b> by primary beater tools when reaching the top of the rotor. The beaters also accelerate the product, moving it into the milling zone proper, {{at the side of the}} rotor. There the grinding stock fluidised in the air flow is comminuted by the grinding tools (rotor, stator). The stator is formed by a cover enclosing the rotor. The inside of this cover is provided with toothed grooves running vertical, i.e. crosswise to the sense of rotation of the rotor. The outside of the rotor is covered by numerous U-shaped sections which form a deep cassette-type structure. This geometry creates extreme air whirls in the rotor's grinding zone which induce intense secondary comminution processes due to the particles crashing into each other and due to friction and shearing forces. The final particle size can be adjusted over a wide range by changing the grinding rotor clearance, air flow and rotor speed.|$|R

Recent {{studies have shown that}} (-) -epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), one of the green tea polyphenols, has potent antioxidant effects against free radical-mediated lipid peroxidation in ischemia-induced neuronal damage. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine whether EGCG would attenuate neuronal expression of NADPH-d/nNOS in the motor neurons of the lower brainstem following peripheral nerve crush. Thus, young adult rats were treated with EGCG (10, 25, or 50 mg/kg, i. p.) 30 min prior to crushing their hypoglossal and vagus nerves for 30 seconds (left side, at the cervical level). The treatment (<b>pre-crush</b> doses of EGCG) was continued from day 1 to day 6, and the animals were sacrificed on days 3, 7, 14 and 28. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemistry and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) immunohistochemistry were used to assess neuronal NADPH-d/nNOS expression in the hypoglossal nucleus and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. Results In rats treated with high dosages of EGCG (25 or 50 mg/kg), NADPH-d/nNOS reactivity and cell death of the motor neurons were significantly decreased. Conclusions The present evidence indicated that EGCG can reduce NADPH-d/nNOS reactivity and thus may enhance motor neuron survival time following peripheral nerve injury. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{concentrations}} of dissolved noble gases in water {{are widely used}} as a climate proxy to determine noble gas temperatures (NGTs); i. e., {{the temperature of the}} water when gas exchange last occurred. In this paper we make a step forward to apply this principle to fluid inclusions in stalagmites in order to reconstruct the cave temperature prevailing at the time when the inclusion was formed. We present an analytical protocol that allows us accurately to determine noble gas concentrations and isotope ratios in stalagmites, and which includes a precise manometrical determination of the mass of water liberated from fluid inclusions. Most important for NGT determination is {{to reduce the amount of}} noble gases liberated from air inclusions, as they mask the temperature-dependent noble gas signal from the water inclusions. We demonstrate that offline <b>pre-crushing</b> in air to subsequently extract noble gases and water from the samples by heating is appropriate to separate gases released from air and water inclusions. Although a large fraction of recent samples analysed by this technique yields NGTs close to present-day cave temperatures, the interpretation of measured noble gas concentrations in terms of NGTs is not yet feasible using the available least squares fitting models. This is because the noble gas concentrations in stalagmites are not only composed of the two components air and air saturated water (ASW), which these models are able to account for. The observed enrichments in heavy noble gases are interpreted as being due to adsorption during sample preparation in air, whereas the excess in He and Ne is interpreted as an additional noble gas component that is bound in voids in the crystallographic structure of the calcite crystals. As a consequence of our study's findings, NGTs will have to be determined in the future using the {{concentrations of}} Ar, Kr and Xe only. This needs to be achieved by further optimizing the sample preparation to minimize atmospheric contamination and to further reduce the amount of noble gases released from air inclusions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCalcium looping is a {{promising}} technology for CO 2 capture {{as it may}} reduce considerably the energy penalty represented by the capture system. The CO 2 capture efficiency will strongly depend on the reactor configuration, solids residence time and thermal operation. As these parameters are also interdependent, {{the impact on the}} process can be better understood by process modelling and flow modelling. Use of model results can be very valuable {{in the design of the}} process. Properties such as minimum fluidization velocity and void fraction related to limestone particles are important parameters for process simulations as well as for simulations of flow behaviour in the reactor. Limestone (calcite) with a high content of CaCO 3 can be a good sorbent material as it is readily available at low cost. Limestone from a local cement plant was used in this study. The material which had been <b>pre-crushed</b> in a mill at the plant was classified into four different size classes: 120 - 150 μm, 150 - 180 μm, 180 - 300 μm and 300 - 500 μm. A lab-scale fluidized bed made in plexi-glass, with a diameter of 146 mm and a uniform air distribution, was used to determine the properties of the sorbent. Four separate experiments were run for each group of particles. The minimum fluidization velocity and the related void fraction were then determined. Multiphase flow simulations were then carried out, using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software BARRACUDA®. The simulation results compared reasonably well with the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Comminution {{test methods}} used within mineral {{processing}} have mainly {{been developed for}} selecting the most appropriate comminution technology for a given ore, designing a grinding circuit as well as sizing the equipment needed. Existing test methods usually require comparatively large sample amounts and are time-consuming to conduct. This makes comprehensive testing of ore comminution behavior – as required in the geometallurgical context – quite expensive. Currently the main interest {{in the conduct of}} comminution test lies in the determination of particle size reduction and related energy consumption by grindability test methods, which provide the necessary information about mill throughput. In this procedure mineral liberation is regarded as a fixed parameter due to missing this information in ore characterization as well as a lack of suitable comminution models. However, ignoring the connection between particle size and mineral liberation prevents the scheduling and controlling of the production process from being optimal. For these reasons new comminution tests need to be developed or alternatively the existing test methods need to be suited to geometallurgical testing where the aim is to map the variation of processing properties of an entire ore body. The objective of this research work is on the one hand to develop small-scale comminution test methods that allow linking comminution behavior and liberation characteristics to mineralogical parameters, {{and on the other hand}} establish a modeling framework including mineral liberation information. Within the first stage of the study the comminution of drill cores from Malmberget’s magnetite ore, classified by modal mineralogy and texture information, have been investigated. It was found that there is a direct correlation between the mechanical strength of the rock, as received from unconfined compressive or point load tests, and the crusher reduction ratio as a measure for crushability. However, a negative correlation was found between crushability and grindability for the same samples. The grindability showed inverse correlation with both magnetite grade and the magnetite’s mineral grain size. The preliminary conclusion is that modal mineralogy and micro-texture (grain size) can be used to quantitatively describe the ore comminution behavior although the applied fracture mechanism of the mill cannot be excluded. With crushed ore samples from Malmberget also grindability tests and mineral liberation analyses were conducted using laboratory tumbling mills of different size. Starting from the dimensions of the Bond ball mill a modified test method was developed where small size samples of approximately 220 g were <b>pre-crushed</b> and ground in a down-scaled one-stage grindability test. Down-scaling was done by keeping similar impact effects between the mills. Mill speed and grinding time were used for adjusting the number of fracture events in order to receive similar particle size distributions and specific grinding energy when decreasing mill size by the factor 1. 63. A detailed description of the novel geometallurgical comminution test (GCT) is given. With respect to ore crushability and autogenous and semiautogenous grinding (AG/SAG) also drop weight tests were conducted. For a more accurate and precise measurement of the energy transferred to the sample a novel instrumented drop weight was used. Initial tests with fractions of drill cores and <b>pre-crushed</b> ore particles showed that the simple energy calculation based on potential energy needs to be corrected. For the future work these tests will be extended to other ore types in order to investigate the effects of mineralogy and to include mineral liberation in comminution models suitable for geometallurgy.
