25|$|The Anniversary series found {{prominence}} with Joe Satriani in particular, who favoured {{the early}} EL34 powered versions and used only the clean channel live {{along with his}} signature Vox Satchurator distortion pedal {{which is based on}} his old modded Boss DS-1. Satriani used these older Boss pedals almost exclusively for live work and on a number of studio albums including The Extremist (1992) until the early 2000s. The Anniversary models were probably the most complicated Marshall ever (other than perhaps the later JVM), with MIDI channel selection, half <b>power</b> <b>switching,</b> pentode/triode switching, adjustable speaker excursion, and a low volume compensation switch. Despite all this complication the amps had a pure signal path that did not share preamp tubes between channels (unlike later Marshall designs like the TSL and JVM). Other famous 6100 users included Alex Lifeson on Rush's album Test for Echo (1996) and Ocean Colour Scene (OCS) guitarist Steve Cradock.|$|E
