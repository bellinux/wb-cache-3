The NK 2nd Division, {{concentrated}} in the Sinban-ni area west of the river, had, in effect, attacked straight east across the river and was trying to seize the two avenues of advance into Changnyong above and below Lake U-p'o. On August 31, 1950, Lake U-p'o was a large body of water although in most places very shallow. The massive North Korean attack had made deep penetrations everywhere in the division sector except in the north in the zone of the 38th Infantry. The NK 9th Division had effected major crossings of the Naktong at two <b>principal</b> <b>points</b> against the US 9th Infantry; the NK 2nd Division in the meantime had made three major crossings against the US 23rd Infantry; and the NK 10th Division had begun crossing more troops in the Hill 409 area near Hyongp'ung in the US 38th Infantry sector.|$|E

It consists of a double line of military walls that meanders over the granite terrain of the promontory.

The Moorish Castle, due to its geographic place and design, was considered, along with Santarém, one of the <b>principal</b> <b>points</b> of the military plan of Belata (the Muslim province which corresponds to the Ribatejo and Estremadura).

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we deal with}} the problem of {{calibrating}} a rotating and zooming camera whose internal calibration parameters change frame by frame without 3 D pattern. First, we show theoretically that the calibration is unique up to an orthogonal transformation under the assumption that the skew of the camera is zero. Auto-calibration is possible by analyzing inter-image homographies computed from the matches in images of the same scene. In general, at least four homographies are needed for auto-calibration. When we further assume that the aspect ratio is known and the <b>principal</b> <b>point</b> is fixed during the sequence then one homography yields camera parameters, and when the aspect ratio is assumed to be unknown with fixed <b>principal</b> <b>point</b> then two homographies are enough. In the case of a fixed <b>principal</b> <b>point,</b> we suggest a method for obtaining the calibration parameters by searching the space of the <b>principal</b> <b>point.</b> If this is not the case, then nonlinear iteration is applied.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} first the {{uniqueness}} of the selfcalibration of a rotating and zooming camera theoretically. We assume that the <b>principal</b> <b>point</b> and the aspect ratio are fixed but the focal length changes as the camera moves. In this case, at least one inter-image homography is required in order to compute the internal calibration parameters as well as the rotation. Secondly, we analyze the effects of the deviation of the <b>principal</b> <b>point</b> on the estimation of the focal length and the rotation. The more the camera changes its zoom, the larger the effects are, and the larger the rotation angle is, the smaller the effects are. Thus, we may take the image center as the <b>principal</b> <b>point</b> in practical applications. Experiments using real images are given...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- For {{omnidirectional}} cameras, most of {{the previous}} calibration methods from lines use conic fitting. This paper presents a calibration method for para-catadioptric-like cameras from lines without conic fitting under a single view. We establish equations on the five camera intrinsic parameters. These equations are linear for the focal lengths and skew factor once the <b>principal</b> <b>point</b> is known. The <b>principal</b> <b>point</b> can be approximated well by {{the center of the}} imaged mirror contour in practice or can be accurately estimated by quadric equations. After obtaining the <b>principal</b> <b>point,</b> we propose an algorithm to calibrate the focal lengths and skew factor. The algorithm needs neither prior structure knowledge nor conic fitting and is linear, which make it easy to implement. Other omnidirectional cameras can also use this presented work if high accuracy is not required. Experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm...|$|R
