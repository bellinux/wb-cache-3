Eyes detect light and convert it into electro-chemical impulses in neurons. In higher organisms, the eye is a complex optical system which collects light from the surrounding environment, regulates its intensity through a diaphragm, focuses it through an adjustable assembly of lenses to form an image, converts this image into a set of electrical signals, and transmits these signals to the brain through complex neural pathways that connect the eye via the optic nerve to the visual cortex and {{other areas of the}} brain. Eyes with resolving power have come in ten fundamentally different forms, and 96% of animal species possess a complex optical system. Image-resolving eyes are present in molluscs, chordates and arthropods.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "fixed pattern noise" [...] usually {{refers to}} two parameters. One is the DSNU (dark signal non-uniformity), {{which is the}} offset from the average across the imaging array at a {{particular}} setting (temperature, integration time) but no external illumination and the PRNU (<b>photo</b> <b>response</b> non-uniformity), which describes the gain or ratio between optical power on a pixel versus the electrical signal output. The latter is often simplified as a single value measured at e.g. 50% saturation level, implying a linear approximation of the not perfectly linear <b>photo</b> <b>response</b> <b>photo</b> <b>response</b> non-linearity (PRNL). [...] Often PRNU as defined above is subdivided in pure [...] "(offset) FPN" [...] which is the part not dependent on temperature and integration time, and the integration time and temperature dependent [...] "DSNU".Sometimes pixel noise as the average deviation from the array average under different illumination and temperature conditions is specified. Pixel noise therefore gives a number (commonly expressed in rms) that identifies FPN in all permitted imaging conditions, which might strongly deteriorate if additional electrical gain (and noise) is included.|$|E

50|$|FPN is {{commonly}} suppressed by flat-field correction (FFC) that uses DSNU and PRNU to linearly interpolate {{and reduce the}} local <b>photo</b> <b>response</b> (non-uniform PRNL) to the array average. Hence, two exposures with an equal illumination across the array are necessary (one without light and one close to saturation) to obtain the values. Note that this correction usually is very sensitive to modifications of the system parameters (i.e., exposure time, temperature). The main challenge is to generate a flat field illumination for short time exposures and wavelengths, to avoid speckle (in monochromatic light conditions) and statistical fluctuations of the light stream that become most obvious at short integration times.|$|E
50|$|The {{visual system}} {{is the part of}} the central nervous system which gives organisms the ability to process visual detail, as well as {{enabling}} the formation of several non-image <b>photo</b> <b>response</b> functions. It detects and interprets information from visible light to build a representation of the surrounding environment. The visual system carries out a number of complex tasks, including the reception of light and the formation of monocular representations; the buildup of a nuclear binocular perception from a pair of two dimensional projections; the identification and categorization of visual objects; assessing distances to and between objects; and guiding body movements in relation to the objects seen. The psychological process of visual information is known as visual perception, a lack of which is called blindness. Non-image forming visual functions, independent of visual perception, include the pupillary light reflex (PLR) and circadian photoentrainment.|$|E

30|$|Photocatalytic {{mechanism}} of PPy-TiO 2 nanocomposites {{can be described}} as below. The photocurrent values obtained from PPy to TiO 2 nanocomoposite are higher than TiO 2. PPy is a p-type narrow band gap semiconductor when compared with other inorganic semiconductors (TiO 2, SrTiO 3, ZnO) having n-type narrow band gap semiconductor. The lowest vacant molecular orbital level of PPy is positioned in an actively higher location than the conduction band edge of TiO 2. Consequently, when the system was illuminated, the excited electrons of PPy in the highest engaged molecular orbital level could move to the LUMO level, then these electrons could be transferred into the conduction band of the TiO 2. Thus, more and extra photo energized electrons formed in TiO 2 and the combination of the semiconductors (p–n junction) should have a beneficial role in getting better charge separation. As a result, this scheme delivers important <b>photo</b> <b>responses</b> in this intersection.|$|R
40|$|Phototaxis (the {{response}} of insects to light), though {{seems to be}} a common insect population phenomenon, distinctions between different species in their response to light do exist. Certain insects such as cockroaches have negative phototaxis, meaning they are repelled by exposure to light. Moths, flies, beetles and many other flying insects have positive phototaxis, meaning they are naturally attracted to light. These <b>photo</b> <b>responses</b> have been exploited to manage insect pests. One of the early and better integrated pest management (IPM) alternatives to pesticides is the insect light trap. Long before IPM took center stage, the insect light trap was one of the principal weapons in the war with insect pests. In recent past, seed borer, Trymalitis margarias Meyrick (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) has become a major pest on sapota causing huge direct fruit loss upto 35 % (Jayanthi and Verghese, 2007). The concealed nature of larvae within the seeds renders the management of this pest a real challenge. This prompted a study at India...|$|R

40|$|Due to its {{remarkable}} {{tolerance to}} high energy ionizing radiation, GaN has recently attracted attention as a promising material for dosimetry applications. However, materials issues {{that lead to}} persistent photoconductivity, poor sensitivity, and requirements for large operational voltages have been hurdles to realization of the full potential of this material.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 04 This work investigates (i) contact {{asymmetry}} induced {{response of}} semiconductors, {{with emphasis on}} nanowire <b>photo</b> <b>response,</b> and (ii) strain induced electronic and optoelectronic properties of narrow silicon nanowires. Contact area asymmetry is shown to produce large zero-bias <b>photo</b> <b>response</b> in bulk silicon, which is explained by TCAD modeling. Modeling also shows that both short circuit current and open circuit voltage in nanowire solar cells and photo sensors can be enhanced by using contact metals with large work function difference. This does not need any p-n junction type asymmetric band structure device that requires high and controlled doping. However, two-contact large nanowires are found to suffer from low current density due to minority carrier recombination and inefficient carrier collection at contacts. As a solution, multi-contact and grounded-gate designs are modeled and found to enhance <b>photo</b> <b>response.</b> By simple fabrication and characterization, we show that nanowire networks with dual-metal contacts produce large photo currents. Interestingly, a sparse network gives larger response than a relatively dense network. High resistance nanowire-nanowire contact is shown to place a limit on electrical transport and explains such unintuitive response. Finally, Molecular dynamics and quantum mechanical transport simulation of bent narrow silicon nanowires show that bending strain causes larger decrease in transmission gap compared to the usually investigated uniaxial strain and that a moderate amount of bending strain may be capable of causing a semiconductor to metal transition...|$|E

We have tried to analyze the photoreceptor inputs to these triphasic horizontal cells. Dark adapted, isolated retinas were used. Responses were recorded intracellularly {{and some of the}} cells were morphologically identified with lucifer yellow injection. In the dark adapted state, depolarization to monochromatic light flashes ranged between 440 and 600 nm. The maximal depolarizing response was obtainded around at 520 nm. Even dim white flashes, could produce depolarizing responses in C 3 HC 2 ̆ 7 s, when dark adapted. The thresholds of the responses were almost identical to those of rod horizontal cells. In contrast, under light adaptation, the depolarizing responses disappeared and all the responses were hyperpolarizing. We conclude that the dynamic range of the responses is more than 5 log units. These results suggest that C 3 HC 2 ̆ 7 s receive both rod and cone inputs.
