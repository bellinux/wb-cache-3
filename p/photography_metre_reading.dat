In particular is the PLC application of automatic <b>metre</b> <b>reading</b> (AMR) using powerline carriers. The main purpose of this project is to investigate currently existing adaptive routing protocols and see what can be borrowed from these routing techniques, hence implementing them into the AMR system provided by Pulse Utilities Ltd. This report starts off by discussing the important findings from the comprehensive literature research carried out in phase one of the project. Several different AMR systems using the PLC technology have been looked at and were analysed. Many adaptive routing techniques used in telecommunication and computer networking have been investigated and the OSPF routing protocol was chosen. This {{is due to the}} OSPF routing protocol’s support for hierarchical networks and adaptive routing, as well as having the Shortest Path First algorithm for finding the optimal communication path...|$|R

[...] There is {{controversy}} over Griffith-Joyner's world record as {{questions have been}} raised as to whether the wind actually was ever zero, as indicated by the trackside anemometer. The triple-jump anemometer, some 10 <b>metres</b> away, <b>read</b> 4.3 m/s, more than double the acceptable limit. Despite the controversy, the record is ratified by the IAAF. The second-fastest wind legal time of 10.61 seconds was also run by Griffith-Joyner. The second fastest athlete of all time is Carmelita Jeter with 10.64 seconds.|$|R
60|$|We can, indeed, never {{expect an}} {{authentic}} edition of our elder dramatic poets (for in those times a drama was a poem), until some man undertakes the work, {{who has studied}} the philosophy of metre. This has been found the main torch of sound restoration in the Greek dramatists by Bentley, Porson, and their followers;--how much more, then, in writers in our own language! It is true that quantity, an almost iron law with the Greek, is in English rather a subject for a peculiarly fine ear, than any law or even rule; but, then, instead of it, we have, first, accent; secondly, emphasis; and lastly, retardation, and acceleration of the times of syllables according to the meaning of the words, the passion that accompanies them, and even the character of the person that uses them. With due attention to these,--above all, to that, which requires the most attention and the finest taste, the character, Massinger, for example, might be reduced to a rich and yet regular metre. But then the 'regulæ' must be first known;--though I will venture to say, that he who does not find a line (not corrupted) of Massinger's flow to the time total of a trimeter catalectic iambic verse, has not read it aright. But by virtue of the last principle--the retardation or acceleration of time--we have the proceleusmatic foot * * * *, and the 'dispondaeus' -- -- -- --, not to mention the 'choriambus', the ionics, paeons, and epitrites. Since Dryden, the metre of our poets leads to the sense: in our elder and more genuine bards, the sense, including the passion, leads to the <b>metre.</b> <b>Read</b> even Donne's satires as he meant them to be read, and as the sense and passion demand, and you will find in the lines a manly harmony.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{potential}} {{use of a}} hand-held portable SPAD chlorophyll metre for rapid assessment of specific leaf area (SLA) and specific leaf nitrogen (SLN), which are surrogate measures of transpiration efficiency (TE) in 15 cultivars of peanut (A. hypogaea). The effects of sampling (leaf position, time of sampling and leaf water status) and climatic factors (solar radiation and vapour pressure deficit, VPD) on SLA and SPAD chlorophyll <b>metre</b> <b>reading</b> (SCMR) were studied {{in a range of}} peanut genotypes grown under field and greenhouse conditions. Field and greenhouse trials were conducted during the post-rainy (November to April 1997 - 98) and rainy seasons (July to October 1998) in Andhra Pradesh, India. The correlation between SLA and SCMR was significant (r=- 0. 77, P< 0. 01) for the second leaf from the apex but the correlation declined for leaves sampled from lower nodal positions. The diurnal fluctuation in SLA ranged from - 20 to + 10 %, whereas SCMR was relatively unaffected by these diurnal changes. Solar radiation and VPD during the sampling period had a significant influence on the relationship between SLA and SCMR, largely through their effects on SLA. However, standardization of SLA for these environmental factors significantly improved the relationship between SLA and SCMR from - 0. 50 to - 0. 80 (P< 0. 01), suggesting that, when protocols for leaf sampling and SLA measurements are followed, SCMR can be a surrogate measure of SLA. There were significant relationships between SLN and SCMR (r= 0. 84, P< 0. 01) and SLN and SLA (r=- 0. 81, P< 0. 01). These significant interrelationships amongst SLA, SLN and SCMR suggested that SCMR {{could be used as a}} reliable and rapid measure to identify genotypes with low SLA or high SLN (and hence high TE) in peanut...|$|R
40|$|Two pot {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} two different seasons at the University of Agricultural Science, Bangalore, India, to study (a) the relationship between chlorophyll concentration (by measuring the leaf light-transmittance characteristics using a SPAD metre) and transpiration efficiency (TE) and (b) the effect of leaf N on chlorophyll and TE relationship in peanut. In Experiment (Expt) I, six peanut genotypes with wide genetic variation for the specific leaf area (SLA) were used. In Expt II, three non-nodulating isogenic lines were used to study the effect of N levels on leaf chlorophyll concentration–TE relationship without potential confounding effects in biological nitrogen fixation. Leaf N was manipulated by applying N fertiliser in Expt II. Chlorophyll concentration, TE (g dry matter kg− 1 of H 2 O transpired, measured using gravimetric method), specific leaf nitrogen (g N m− 2, SLN), SLA (cm 2 g− 1), carbon isotope composition (Δ 13 C) were determined in the leaves sampled during the treatment period (35 – 55 days after sowing) in the two experiments. Results showed that the leaf chlorophyll concentration expressed as soil plant analytical development (SPAD) chlorophyll <b>metre</b> <b>reading</b> (SCMR) varied significantly among genotypes in Expt I {{and as a result}} of N application in Expt II. Changes in leaf N levels were strongly associated with changes in SCMR, TE and Δ 13 C. In both the experiments, a significant positive relationship between SCMR and TE with similar slopes but differing intercepts was noticed. However, correction of TE for seasonal differences in vapour pressure deficit (VPD) between the two experiments resulted in a single and stronger relationship between SCMR and TE. There was a significant inverse relationship between SCMR and Δ 13 C, suggesting a close linkage between chlorophyll concentration and Δ 13 C in peanut. This study provides the first evidence for a significant positive relationship between TE and leaf chlorophyll concentration in peanut. The study also describes the effect of growing environment on the relationships among SLA, SLN and SCM...|$|R

60|$|A powerful, robust, {{athletic}} man, in florid {{health and}} of temperate habits, yet with the full-blooded {{tendency of the}} eighteenth century vividly displayed in his ample face and broad features, Erasmus Darwin bubbled over with irrepressible vivacity, the outward and visible sign of that overflowing energy which forms everywhere one of the most marked determining conditions of high genius. Strong in body and strong in mind, a teetotaler before teetotalism, an abolitionist before the anti-slavery movement, he had a great contempt for weaknesses and prejudices of every sort, and he rose far superior to the age in which he lived in breadth of view and freedom from preconceptions. The eighteenth century considered him, in its cautious, cut-and-dried fashion, a man of singular talent but of remarkably eccentric and unsafe opinions. Unfortunately for his lasting fame, Dr. Darwin was much given to writing poetry; and this poetry, though as ingenious as everything else he did, had a certain false gallop of verse about it which has doomed it to become since Canning's parody a sort of warning beacon against the worst faults of the post-Augustan decadence in the ten-syllabled <b>metre.</b> Nobody now <b>reads</b> the 'Botanic Garden' except either to laugh at its exquisite extravagances, or to wonder at the queer tinsel glitter of its occasional clever rhetorical rhapsodies.|$|R
