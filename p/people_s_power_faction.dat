40|$|Abstract—The Class-E power {{amplifier}} {{is widely used}} because of its high efficiency, resulting from switching at zero voltage and zero slope of the switch voltage. In this paper, we extend our general analytical solutions for the Class-E {{power amplifier}} to the ideal single-ended Variable Slope Class-E (Class-EV <b>S)</b> <b>power</b> amplifier which is switching at zero voltage but not necessarily at zero slope. It is shown that a Class-EV <b>S</b> <b>power</b> amplifier can have higher tolerance to switch (transistor) output capacitance compared to the normal Class-E power amplifier; this higher tolerance can be exchanged for higher drain efficiency. The presented design equations for Class-EV <b>S</b> <b>power</b> amplifiers give more degrees of freedom {{in the design and}} optimization of switching RF power amplifiers...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{assessed}} the {{agreement between the}} powers recorded during a 30 s upper-body Wingate test using three different methods. Fifty-six men completed a single test on a Monark 814 E mechanically braked ergometer fitted with a Schoberer Rad Messtechnik (SRM) powermeter. A commercial software package (Wingate test kit version 2. 21, Cranlea, UK) was used to calculate conventional and corrected (with accelerative forces) values of power based on a resistive load (5 % body mass) and flywheel velocity. The SRM calculated powers based on torque (measured at the crank arm) and crank rate. Values for peak 1 and 5 <b>s</b> <b>power</b> and mean 30 <b>s</b> <b>power</b> were measured. No significant differences (P > 0. 05) {{were found between the}} three methods for 30 <b>s</b> <b>power</b> values. However, the corrected values for peak 1 and 5 <b>s</b> <b>power</b> were 36 and 23 % higher (P 0. 05). Power values recorded using each method were influenced by sample time (P < 0. 05). Our results suggest that these three measures of power are similar when sampled over 30 s, but discrepancies occur when the sample time is reduced to either 1 or 5 s...|$|R
