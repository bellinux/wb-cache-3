5|$|The {{composition}} of the Council was changed several times. The number of non-permanent members was first increased to six on 22 September 1922 and to nine on 8 September 1926. Werner Dankwort of Germany pushed for his country to join the League; joining in 1926, Germany became the fifth <b>permanent</b> <b>member</b> of the Council. Later, after Germany and Japan both left the League, the number of non-permanent seats was increased from nine to eleven, and the Soviet Union was made a <b>permanent</b> <b>member</b> giving the Council a total of fifteen members. The Council met, on average, five times a year and in extraordinary sessions when required. In total, 107 sessions were held between 1920 and 1939.|$|E
5|$|India's bid for <b>{{permanent}}</b> <b>member</b> of UNSC is now {{backed by}} {{four of the}} five permanent members, namely France, Russia, United Kingdom and United States. On 15 April 2011, China officially expressed its support for an increased Indian role at the United Nations, without explicitly endorsing India's Security Council ambitions. However, recently China endorsed Indian candidacy as a permanent UNSC member provided that India revokes its support for Japanese candidacy.|$|E
40|$|This project {{sets out}} to {{investigate}} {{the capabilities of the}} <b>permanent</b> <b>members</b> of the United Nations Security Council, and some potential new <b>permanent</b> <b>members.</b> The project explains and utilizes Waltzâ€™s neorealist theory to help investigate the <b>permanent</b> <b>members</b> through a capability analysis. The capability analysis consists of six parameters that the <b>permanent</b> <b>members</b> will be measured in, as well as the potential new <b>permanent</b> <b>members.</b> The goal of this project is to show how the distribution of capabilities are divided among the five permanent states in the Security Council, as well as to find out if there are states outside the permanent seats, with better capabilities than some of the current <b>permanent</b> <b>members.</b> The findings of the project show that there are states without permanent a seat, which have greater capabilities than some of the current <b>permanent</b> <b>members.</b> The project finds that India is a worthy candidate for a position in the Security Council. The fact that there are more capable states outside the Security Council is problematic, as there are states more worthy of a permanent seat due to the notion that the Security Council is to for the greatest powers...|$|R

5|$|As the band's main producer, singer, songwriter, and instrumentalist, Reznor was {{considered}} the only constant member and creative force within the group through much of its history. However, this changed in 2016 when Atticus Ross was introduced as a <b>permanent</b> <b>member</b> of Nine Inch Nails, alongside {{the announcement of the}} Not the Actual Events EP. Furthermore, Reznor typically assembles a live band to perform with him onstage. These touring bands comprise a revolving lineup, and often rearrange songs to fit a live setting. Nine Inch Nails often employs thematic visual elements to accompany on stage performances as well, which frequently include elaborate light shows.|$|E
5|$|In 1832 the Reform Act {{was passed}} by Parliament, {{widening}} the electorate across the country. The Isle of Bute's electorate rose to 300 and acquired a <b>permanent</b> <b>Member</b> of Parliament, still controlled by Bute. Cardiff saw a short-term drop in its electorate {{as a result of}} the act, and Bute benefited from the granting of the vote to many of his richer agricultural tenants. In the aftermath of the reforms, Bute secretly sponsored the creation of the conservative newspaper the Glamorgan Monmouth and Brecon Gazette and Merthyr Guardian, to increase support across the county, and underwrote its losses for many years.|$|E

In December 1941, she was offered a research position by Milislav Demerec, the newly appointed acting director of the Carnegie Institution of Washington's Department of Genetics Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory; McClintock accepted his invitation despite her qualms and became a <b>permanent</b> <b>member</b> of the faculty.|$|E

Likewise, nearly all nations host American diplomatic missions. However, Iran, North Korea, Bhutan, and the Republic of China (Taiwan) do not have formal diplomatic relations with the United States (although the U.S. still maintains relations with Taiwan and supplies it with military equipment).|$|E

5|$|The United States sent strong {{indications}} to Brazil that it {{was willing}} to support its membership; albeit, without a veto. In June 2011, the Council on Foreign Relations recommended that the US government fully endorse the inclusion of Brazil as a <b>permanent</b> <b>member</b> of the Security Council. Brazil has received backing from other permanent members: Russia, the United Kingdom and France, and from the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP), Chile, Indonesia, Finland, Slovenia, Australia, South Africa, Guatemala, Vietnam and the Philippines, {{as well as from}} the other G4 nations, who mutually support each other.|$|E
5|$|During Middleton's {{tenure at}} LSU the {{presidency}} of the university changed hands from President Atkinson to President James Monroe Smith, the latter an appointee of Governor Long. Towards the end of Middleton's fourth year on campus President Smith asked him if he would stay on for an additional year and also become Dean of Men. Middlteon responded that he would accept, but it had to be cleared through the War Department. Smith's request to the War Department for both the extension and the deanship for Middleton were approved. Toward the end of the fifth year Smith went a step further, suggesting that Middleton retire from the army and become a <b>permanent</b> <b>member</b> of the LSU staff. Middleton would not even consider retirement, but accepted a sixth year with the ROTC program. As he began his sixth year on campus, on 1 Aug 1935, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, the Nasution {{siblings}} {{formed a}} band; Chrisye and Joris watched them play songs by Uriah Heep and Blood, Sweat & Tears. In 1968 Chrisye registered at the Christian University of Indonesia (UKI) {{to fulfill his}} father's wish that he become an engineer. Around 1969, however, Gauri invited him to join the Nasutions' band, Sabda Nada, {{as a replacement for}} their bassist Eddi Odek who was ill. Pleased with his performance, the Nasutions asked him to stay as a <b>permanent</b> <b>member.</b> The group had a regular gig at Mini Disko on Juanda Street and freelanced at birthday and wedding parties. When Chrisye had a chance to sing while performing covers, he attempted to sound as much like the original artist as he could.|$|E

5|$|The Security Council {{is made up}} {{of fifteen}} member states, {{consisting}} of five permanent membersâ€”China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United Statesâ€”and ten non-permanent members elected for two-year terms by the General Assembly (with end of term date)â€”Bolivia (term ends 2018), Egypt (2017), Ethiopia (2018), Italy (2018), Japan (2017), Kazakhstan (2018), Senegal (2017), Sweden (2018), Ukraine (2017), Uruguay (2017). The five permanent members hold veto power over UN resolutions, allowing a <b>permanent</b> <b>member</b> to block adoption of a resolution, though not debate. The ten temporary seats are held for two-year terms, with five member states per year voted in by the General Assembly on a regional basis. The presidency of the Security Council rotates alphabetically each month.|$|E
5|$|Martin {{was fired}} from the band later that year due to musical differences, via a fax from {{keyboard}} player Roddy Bottum; and Mr. Bungle guitarist Trey Spruance {{was brought in to}} record their next album. However, Spruance left the band before the subsequent tour, and was replaced by the band's keyboard roadie, Dean Menta. Reasons given for the change differâ€”the band claim Spruance was unwilling to commit to a long touring schedule in support of the album, whilst Spruance claims he was never meant to be a <b>permanent</b> <b>member</b> in the first place. Roddy Bottum also claims to have been mostly absent during this period, owing to the deaths of his father and Kurt Cobain, whose wife Courtney Love was a close friend of his and one of the temporary lead singers of the band before Chuck Mosely joined. Bottum's absence led to the album being written largely without keyboards. Around the recording of the album in 1994, Mike Patton also got married to Italian woman Cristina Zuccatosta.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{closed out}} {{the season with}} two {{complete}} games, the first against the Braves on September 27, and the second against the Dodgers on October 2.

At {{the end of the}} season, he led the Astros' pitching staff in wins, starts, complete games, innings pitched, walks and strikeouts. He had 18wins and 12losses in 267innings pitched and posted a 2.97ERA and 214strikeouts. For the first time since becoming a <b>permanent</b> <b>member</b> of the Astros' starting rotation, Richard was not the league leader in walks allowed, but as he had done in 1976, he led the league in wild pitches. He finished fourth in the league with 13 complete games, and he improved his fielding from the previous season by going through an error-free season.|$|E
