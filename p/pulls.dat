40|$|This {{review article}} {{examines}} previous weightlifting literature {{and provides a}} rationale {{for the use of}} weightlifting <b>pulling</b> derivatives that eliminate the catch phase for athletes who are not competitive weightlifters. Practitioners should emphasize the completion of the triple extension movement during the second <b>pull</b> phase that is characteristic of weightlifting movements as this is likely to have the greatest transference to athletic performance that is dependent on hip, knee, and ankle extension. The clean <b>pull,</b> snatch <b>pull,</b> hang high <b>pull,</b> jump shrug, and mid-thigh <b>pull</b> are weightlifting <b>pulling</b> derivatives {{that can be used in}} the teaching progression of the full weightlifting movements and are thus less complex with regard to exercise technique. Previous literature suggests that the clean <b>pull,</b> snatch <b>pull,</b> hang high <b>pull,</b> jump shrug, and mid-thigh <b>pull</b> may provide a training stimulus that is as good as, if not better than, weightlifting movements that include the catch phase. Weightlifting <b>pulling</b> derivatives can be implemented throughout the training year, but an emphasis and de-emphasis should be used in order to meet the goals of particular training phases. When implementing weightlifting <b>pulling</b> derivatives, athletes must make a maximum effort, understand that <b>pulling</b> derivatives can be used for both technique work and building strength–power characteristics, and be coached with proper exercise technique. Future research should consider examining the effect of various loads on kinetic and kinematic characteristics of weightlifting <b>pulling</b> derivatives, training with full weightlifting movements as compared to training with weightlifting <b>pulling</b> derivatives, and how kinetic and kinematic variables vary between derivatives of the snatch...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCombined {{with the}} chip guiding, this paper {{presents}} a new “assisted turning method” where the cut chip is <b>pulled</b> using an external <b>pulling</b> device to improve the performance of turning process. In the proposed method, straight unbroken chip is generated by utilizing special tool tips and guided through a guide tunnel for automated chip <b>pulling.</b> The first prototype of chip <b>pulling</b> device is designed that can <b>pull</b> the guided straight chip continuously as the turning operation is carried on. Design of the chip <b>pulling</b> system, proposed <b>pulling</b> device and its automatic control are presented in this research. A brief insight {{on the effect of}} chip <b>pulling</b> to the turning process is discussed by inspecting fundamental process parameters. Experimental results show that by <b>pulling</b> the chip in a controlled manner, process can be improved dramatically. Cutting forces and temperature are effectively reduced in actual “chip <b>pulling</b> turning”...|$|R

5|$|Since {{forces are}} {{perceived}} as pushes or <b>pulls,</b> this can provide an intuitive understanding for describing forces. As with other physical concepts (e.g. temperature), the intuitive understanding of forces is quantified using precise operational definitions {{that are consistent with}} direct observations and compared to a standard measurement scale. Through experimentation, it is determined that laboratory measurements of forces are fully consistent with the conceptual definition of force offered by Newtonian mechanics.|$|E
