40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{identify}} differences in production potential, organization of production, economic efficiency and investment abilities of two groups of polish field farms with cereals, oilseeds and protein crops situated in Less Favoured Areas (LFA) and beside in Dolnośląskie and Opolskie voivodeship. In order to achieve this aim empirical data was used from 64 farms situated in 64 farms that was situated in LFA and from 348 remaining farms that collected data from 2011 to 2013 for Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) in 2011 – 2013. It was found that farms situated in LFA in comparison to remaining farms characterized larger utilized agricultural – area (UAA) and higher share of rented area. Moreover, worse technical equipment of labour and lower family farm income <b>per</b> 1 <b>hectare</b> <b>of</b> <b>UAA</b> is indicated...|$|R

40|$|Florida’s {{large number}} of shallow lakes, warm climate and long growing season {{have contributed to the}} {{development}} of excessive growths of aquatic macrophytes that have seriously interfered with many water use activities. The introduction of exotic aquatic macrophyte species such as hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata) have added significantly to aquatic plant problems in Florida lakes. The use of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) can be an effective and economical control for aquatic vegetation such as hydrilla. Early stocking rates (24 to 74 grass carp <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> <b>of</b> lake area) resulted in grass carp consumption rates that vastly exceeded the growth rates of the aquatic plants and often resulted in the total loss of all submersed vegetation. This study looked at 38 Florida lakes that had been stocked with grass carp for 3 to 10 years with stocking rates ranging from < 1 to 59 grass carp <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> <b>of</b> lake and 1 to 207 grass carp <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> <b>of</b> vegetation to determine the long term effects of grass carp on aquatic macrophyte communities.
