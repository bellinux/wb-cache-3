40|$|The "Live Loading " of <b>valve</b> <b>packing</b> {{has been}} the topic of many {{articles}} and papers {{over the past few}} years. It has been highly recommended by some, and claimed to have no value by others. The truth is both statements can be correct. It all depends on the individual application. The problem is determining if a valve is a candidate for "Live Loading". In most cases this can be decided by answering a few questions! Is it a <b>packed</b> <b>valve?!</b> Does the valve cycle frequently?! Is it motor operated?! Is the valve difficult to get at?! Is the valve subject to high temperatures & pressures?! Is the valve in a critical application?! Does the valve have a history of packing leaks?! Does the valve have to be monitored under the new EPA regulations? If the answer to the first question and any of the others is yes, there is a good possibility that the valve in question is a candidate for live loading. Many different packing materials can and have been live loaded, but since the graphite based materials are the most commonly used in live load applications, the data referred to has been based on these materials. To understand how live loading works, let's first look at how belleville springs work, what live loading is, and when live loading can be used...|$|R

Rotating actuator turns the disc either parallel or perpendicular to the flow. When the valve is fully open, the disc is rotated a quarter turn so that it allows free passage of the fluid and when fully closed, the disc rotated a quarter turns to block the fluid. The primary failure modes for valves are the valve leaks to environment through flanges, seals on the valve body, <b>valve</b> stem <b>packing</b> not properly protected, over tightened <b>packing</b> nuts, the <b>valve</b> cracks and leaks over the seat.

40|$|A {{study of}} engine oil {{consumption}} (OC) was conducted both theoretically and experimentally. It {{was found that}} oil blowing into the combustion chamber through the top ring gap (termed ‘reversed oil’) and oil returning to the crankcase through the oil ring gap (termed ‘blowby oil’) are important factors affecting OC. It was also observed that depending on the ring gap clearance, enlarged because of ring wear (for example the radial ring wear of 50 pm corresponds to a gap enlargement of roughly 0. 31 mm) or non-optimal ring gap clearance and inter-ring volume, the 2 nd land pressure can exceed cylinder pressure-leading to increasing reversed oil and consequently higher OC. The deterioration of OC with increasing operation has been traced to lowered oil-scraping capability with ring wear. This is true. However, the above-mentioned phenomenon {{can be considered as}} another reason for such OC. This paper describes the relationship between reversed oil(b 1 owby oil ratio and OC, and presents a procedure for optimizing ring gap clearance and inter-ring volume for acceptable OC.

40|$|Two {{formulations}} of EPDM elastomer, one substituting a UV stabilizer for the normal antioxidant in this polymer, {{and the other}} the normal formulation, were synthesized and samples of each were exposed to gamma irradiation in initially pure deuterium gas to compare their radiation stability. Stainless steel containers having rupture disks were designed for this task. After 130 MRad dose of cobalt- 60 radiation in the SRNL Gamma Irradiation Facility, {{a significant amount of}} gas was created by radiolysis; however the composition indicated by mass spectroscopy indicated an unexpected increase in the total amount deuterium in both formulations. The irradiated samples retained their ductility in a bend test. No change of sample weight, dimensions, or density was observed. No change of the glass transition temperature as measured by dynamic mechanical analysis was observed, and most of the other dynamic mechanical properties remained unchanged. There appeared to be an increase in the storage modulus of the irradiated samples containing the UV stabilizer above the glass transition, which may indicate hardening of the material by radiation damage. Polymeric materials become damaged by exposure over time to ionizing radiation. Despite the limited lifetime, polymers have unique engineering material properties and polymers continue to be used in tritium handling systems. In tritium handling systems, polymers are employed mainly in joining applications such as valve sealing surfaces (eg. Stem tips, <b>valve</b> <b>packing,</b> and O-rings). Because of the continued need to employ polymers in tritium systems, over the past several years, programs at the Savannah River National Laboratory have been studying the effect of tritium on various polymers of interest. In these studies, samples of materials of interest to the SRS Tritium Facilities (ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, Teflon{reg_sign}), Vespel{reg_sign} polyimide, and the elastomer ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM)) have been exposed in closed containers to tritium gas initially at 1 atmosphere pressure. These studies have demonstrated the degradation of properties when exposed to tritium gas. Also, the radiolytic production of significant amounts of hydrogen has been observed for UHMW-PE and EPDM. The study documented in this report exposes two similar {{formulations of}} EPDM elastomer to gamma irradiation in a closed container backfilled with deuterium. Deuterium is chemically identical to protium and tritium, but allows the identification of protium that is radiolytically produced from the samples.

40|$|This {{document}} {{contains the}} detailed calculations {{that support the}} spray leak accident analysis in the Tank Waste Remediation System (TWRS) Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR). The consequence analyses in this document {{form the basis for}} the selection of controls to mitigate or prevent spray leaks throughout TWRS. Pressurized spray leaks can occur due to a breach in containment barriers along transfer routes, during waste transfers. Spray leaks are of particular safety concern because, depending on leak dimensions, and waste pressure, they can be relatively efficient generators of dispersible sized aerosols that can transport downwind to onsite and offsite receptors. Waste is transferred between storage tanks and between processing facilities and storage tanks in TWRS through a system of buried transfer lines. Pumps for transferring waste and jumpers and valves for rerouting waste are located inside below grade pits and structures that are normally covered. Pressurized spray leaks can emanate to the atmosphere due to breaches in waste transfer associated equipment inside these structures should the structures be uncovered {{at the time of the}} leak. Pressurized spray leaks can develop through holes or cracks in transfer piping, valve bodies or pump casings caused by such mechanisms as corrosion, erosion, thermal stress, or water hammer. Leaks through degraded <b>valve</b> <b>packing,</b> jumper gaskets, or pump seals can also result in pressurized spray releases. Mechanisms that can degrade seals, packing and gaskets include aging, radiation hardening, thermal stress, etc. An 1782 other common cause for spray leaks inside transfer enclosures are misaligned jumpers caused by human error. A spray leak inside a DST valve pit during a transfer of aging waste was selected as the bounding, representative accident for detailed analysis. Sections 2 through 5 below develop this representative accident using the DOE- STD- 3009 format. Sections 2 describes the unmitigated and mitigated accident scenarios evaluated to determine the need for safety class SSCs or TSR controls. Section 3 develops the source terms associated with the unmitigated and mitigated accident scenarios. Section 4 estimates the radiological and toxicological consequences for the unmitigated and mitigated scenarios. Section 5 compares the radiological and toxicological consequences against the TWRS evaluation guidelines. Section 6 extrapolates from the representative accident case to other represented spray leak sites to assess the conservatism in using the representative case to define controls for other postulated spray leak sites throughout TWRS. Section 7 discusses the sensitivities of the consequence analyses to the key parameters and assumptions used in the analyses. Conclusions are drawn in Section 8. The analyses herein pertain to spray leaks initiated due to internal mechanisms (e. g., corrosion, erosion, thermal stress, etc). External initiators of spray leaks (e. g., excavation accidents), and natural phenomena initiators (e. g., seismic events) are to be covered in separate accident analyses...|$|R
