5|$|Major issues {{brought up}} during the {{campaign}} were the candidates' positions on President Obama's stimulus plan, which Tedisco did not take a stance on {{until late in the}} race. Murphy supported it while Tedisco eventually opposed it. Tedisco portrayed Murphy's support of the plan as a potential cause of the AIG bonus scandal. Tedisco's campaign also brought up Murphy's failure to <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> a company he founded in the 1990s. A frequent Murphy talking point was that Tedisco's primary residence was not in the Congressional district.|$|E
5|$|Issues {{surrounding}} {{the planning and}} construction of L'Enfant Plaza (immediately {{to the west of}} the site) delayed construction of any buildings on the block until the late 1960s. In 1963, the RLA purchased the land from the Westminster Memorial Church, Fifth Baptist Church, and homeowners. The United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare wished to purchase the site for its new headquarters, but the RLA declined to sell the property. (The federal government does not <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> land and structures it owns, and the RLA wanted a private owner who would add to the tax base.) The RLA attempted to sell the land on January 29, 1965, but there were no buyers.|$|E
5|$|The {{woman is}} {{revealed}} to be a genie. Stokes is angry that he wasted his first two wishes; Stokes had previously wished for his boss to stop talking (which caused Gilmore's mouth to disappear) and for a boat. The boat, however, was not placed in water and Stokes is still forced to <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> it. The genie suggests that Anson should give his physically handicapped brother the ability to walk as his third wish; but he instead wishes for {{the ability to be}} turned invisible. Anson, now invisible, runs out into the street and is killed by a truck as he crosses the road.|$|E

5|$|Each {{candidate}} {{aimed to}} discredit the other by pointing out his opponent's flaws or mistakes. Republicans called attention to Murphy's failure to <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> a start-up computer software company he had founded in the 1990s, drawing comparison to three high-profile Obama administration nominees who failed to pay all of their taxes. Tedisco also called attention to Murphy's failure to regularly vote in elections after the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) announced that Murphy had failed {{to vote in the}} 2000 presidential election, along with seven other primaries and general elections between 2000 and 2003. Believing the negative ads run by the NRCC were responsible for his drop in the polls, Tedisco announced that he would take control of campaign advertising from the NRCC.|$|E

5000|$|Ms. Taft's father {{purchased}} 100 {{shares of}} stock in 1916 for $1000. In 1923, he gave them to Ms. Taft, when they were valued at $2000. Ms. Taft sold them later that year for $5000. The IRS argued {{that she should have}} to <b>pay</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> $4000 - the total amount of appreciation since the stock was first purchased. Ms. Taft argued that she should only <b>pay</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> $3000 - the amount of appreciation gained while she was the owner of the stock. Although the tax code indicated that Congress specifically intended that donees <b>pay</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> all appreciation since the purchase of the property, Ms. Taft argued that the Sixteenth Amendment did not grant Congress the authority to authorize this type of tax.|$|R

Goldfinger is the treasurer of SMERSH, a Soviet counterintelligence agency, which is Bond's nemesis.

He tells Bond he has done so with four Mafia heads {{at the end of the}} novel.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{their return}} to New France, the two Frenchmen found that their actions had angered the British and alarmed French officials. In order to cover the British losses the Compagnie du Nord was forced to <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> their furs.

25|$|While {{hospitals}} are tax exempt, they <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> the revenue-producing parts. One estimate was that interns (resident) salaries {{for the first}} year were $48,000, second year $51,000, third year $54,000, for programs affiliated with the AOA. Overlook has residency programs for doctors. As an employer, Overlook offers some employees subsidized housing, child care, meal cards, state-of-the-art libraries, online resources, and a complete benefits package. Overlook runs a cafeteria in conjunction with Baltimore-based Donna's Restaurants, Inc. The hospital pays Donna's for use of its brand name as well as methods of operation and recipes.

25|$|Three {{years after}} its completion, in 1892, Wheeler sold the hotel to a Denver man named Archie Fisk for $125,000 ($ in modern dollars) {{as part of a}} general {{liquidation}} of his Aspen assets after losing a lengthy lawsuit over a mining deal. The next year, in response to the Panic of 1893, Congress repealed the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, ending the Colorado Silver Boom and with it Aspen's early boom years. Fisk could not <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> the property, and it soon became the property of Pitkin County, and then became Wheeler's again. It remained the center of the city's social life, partially because it had the only public bathroom downtown.|$|E
25|$|This {{shift to}} S-Corporations means that income {{previously}} not included on {{personal income tax}} returns appeared there during this change, as S-Corporation investors directly <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> corporate profit {{regardless of whether it}} is distributed or not. Furthermore, Reynolds points out in the same literature that tax-deferred savings accounts grew substantially from the 1980s onward, so that investment income to these accounts was not included as personal income in the years which it accrued. The CBO noted {{that at the end of}} 2002, $10.1 trillion was in tax-deferred retirement plans, and that $9 trillion of that was taxable upon withdrawal. These numbers amount to potentially large amounts of investment income to middle-class families that are no longer reported on tax returns each year, but were reported prior to the widespread growth of tax-deferred retirement plans.|$|E

25|$|A lawful {{permanent}} resident {{can apply for}} United States citizenship, or naturalization, {{after five years of}} residency.

In the United States, 8.8 million lawful permanent residents are eligible to naturalize. Citizens are entitled to more rights (and obligations) than permanent residents (who are still classified as aliens in this respect). Lawful permanent residents generally do {{not have the right to}} vote, the right to be elected in federal and state elections (although even naturalized citizens cannot be elected President under Article II of the Constitution), the ability to bring family members to the United States (permanent residents are allowed to sponsor certain family members, but this is often not practical due to long approval delays), or eligibility for federal government jobs. Male permanent residents between the ages of 18 and 25 are subject to registering in the Selective Service System.

The trail was originally part of the Poughkeepsie Bridge Route, a rail corridor that crossed the Hudson via the Poughkeepsie Bridge. Controlled by a variety of railroads throughout the 19thand 20thcenturies, the bridge was damaged and became unusable after a 1974 fire. By the 1980s the corridor's then-owner, Conrail, had routed all rail traffic in the region north through Selkirk, and was eager to relieve itself of the bridge and adjoining rights-of-way. In 1984, it sold the entire property for one dollar to a felon who did not maintain it or <b>pay</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> it. The section of the corridor west of the Hudson was seized by Ulster County in 1991 and transferred to the town of Lloyd.|$|E
