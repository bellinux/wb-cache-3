50|$|Much of {{the current}} {{research}} is into reducing the cycle time, as well as improving <b>part</b> <b>quality.</b> The most promising area is in mold pressurization. It {{is well known that}} applying a small amount of pressure internally to the mold at the correct point in the heating phase accelerates coalescence of the polymer particles during the melting, producing a part with fewer bubbles in less time than at atmospheric pressure. This pressure delays the separation of the part from the mold wall due to shrinkage during the cooling phase, aiding cooling of the part. The main drawback to this is the danger to the operator of explosion of a pressurized part. This has prevented adoption of mold pressurization on a large scale by rotomolding manufacturers.|$|E

Diagnosability has two aspects: detecting machine failure and detecting unacceptable <b>part</b> <b>quality.</b> The second aspect is critical in RMS. As production systems are made more reconfigurable, and their layouts are modified more frequently, it becomes essential to rapidly tune (or ramp-up) the newly reconfigured system so that it produces quality parts. Consequently, reconfigurable systems must also be designed with product quality measurement systems as an integral part. For example, a Reconfigurable Inspection Machine (RIM) embedded in the RMS enables quick detection. These measurement systems are intended to help identify the sources of product quality problems in the production system rapidly, so they can be corrected utilizing control methods, statistics, and signal processing techniques.|$|E
5000|$|Resin {{transfer}} molding (RTM) {{is a method}} of fabricating high-tech composite structures. The RTM process is capable of consistently producing composite parts with high strength, complex geometries, tight dimensional tolerances, and <b>part</b> <b>quality</b> typically required of aerospace applications.RTM uses a closed mold commonly made of aluminum. A fiber [...] "layup" [...] such as graphite is placed into the mold. The mold is closed, sealed, heated, and placed under vacuum. Heated resin is injected into the mold to impregnate the fiber layup. Having the mold heated and under vacuum, as in Vacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Molding (VARTM) assists the resin flow. The mold is then held at a temperature sufficient to cure the resin.Current RTM technology produces lightweight parts with excellent mechanical properties. With these qualities, composite materials are gaining wide use {{in a variety of}} structural and non-structural applications common in aerospace and aviation. RTM is one method of fabricating these composite structures.|$|E

Therefore {{it is significant that}} a precise definition of the examined competencies is given.A qualitatively good potential analysis is based on a solid preparation, requiring a certain period of time. Potential analyses of single candidates require one day whereas the analysis of a group needs up to three days.According to the mentioned time and preparation aspect, it becomes obvious that both the Human resources and the candidates need to be prepared and introduced to the topic of potential analysis. Furthermore it is important that candidates have the possibility to get feedback and an explanation where their strengths and weaknesses are situated.|$|E

Examples include methods and software for monitoring spindle bearing health based on vibration and motor current, a cloud based monitoring architecture for relating tool wear health to <b>part</b> <b>quality,</b> and numerous works on monitoring the health condition of a machine tool feed axis. A low cost and practical method for monitoring the machine tool feed axis was demonstrated in a production environment, in which only controller signals were used to detect the early symptoms of pulley degradation prior {{two weeks before the}} pulley axis failed. For automotive manufacturing, there has recent developments on monitoring the health condition of industrial robots, using available controller signals such as motor current; this approach represents a practical approach for monitoring a fleet of industrial robots. Methods based on frequency analysis and classification algorithms for detecting the early symptoms of surge for air compressors have also been successfully demonstrated and implemented for an automotive manufacturing plant. Data mining and advanced analytical approaches have also been developed for continuous manufacturing production lines and semiconductor manufacturing applications. In terms of success in the manufacturing sector for PHM solutions, there is some economic numbers that can be reported. For example, the National Science Foundation funded in independent economic impacts study on Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRC) and surveyed 5 industrial members of the Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems; the 5 companies (predominantly manufacturing applications) reported a savings of over $855 Million U.S dollars based on the successful implementation of the predictive monitoring and PHM solutions.|$|E
