One of the Insular Cases, Balzac involved a Puerto Rico newspaper publisher who was <b>prosecuted</b> <b>for</b> libel but denied a jury trial, a Sixth Amendment {{protection under the}} constitution.

5|$|In July 2012 it was {{reported}} that police have been given the power to issue £50 on-the-spot fines for littering, cycling outside designated areas and for dog fouling offences.

Others however {{note that this}} last sentence, passed in 1919, was not in fact related to his wartime dealings, but merely to his fraudulent activities, and that only by coincidence did Bogdan-Pitești share a prison with the convicted collaborationist journalists (Arghezi, Karnabatt, Ioan Slavici).|$|E
50|$|The Finns {{initially}} {{thought that}} the trials would be for conventional war crimes. However, as the Moscow Declaration of October 30, 1943 made clear, the Allied powers intended to <b>prosecute</b> <b>for</b> other actions as well.|$|R

5|$|A letter dated 26 September 1985 {{from the}} {{assistant}} director of public prosecutions who prepared the case against Bamber suggests that Mugford not be <b>prosecuted</b> <b>for</b> the burglary, the cheque fraud, and for a further offence of selling cannabis.

5|$|Chandler {{was found}} guilty of the murders, and was sentenced to death on November 4, 1994. He {{maintained}} his innocence, and continued to pursue legal appeals while on Florida's Death Row. He admitted to the Madeira Beach incident but said the sex was consensual, and that the victim changed her mind during the act. Since Chandler had already been sentenced to death for the Rogers family murders, and prosecutors did not want to subject Blair to the emotional trauma of a rape trial, he was never <b>prosecuted</b> <b>for</b> Blair's rape.|$|E
5|$|Conditions in {{the casual}} wards were worse {{than in the}} {{relieving}} rooms and deliberately designed to discourage vagrants, who were considered potential trouble-makers and probably disease-ridden. Vagrants who presented themselves {{at the door of}} a workhouse were {{at the mercy of the}} porter, whose decision it was whether or not to allocate them a bed for the night in the casual ward. Those refused entry risked being sentenced to two weeks of hard labour if they were found begging or sleeping in the open and <b>prosecuted</b> <b>for</b> an offence under the Vagrancy Act 1824.|$|E

The release of the four accused men was authorised by Patrick Cowper, the local minister, who had been involved with the initial witchcraft allegations and the torture and confinement of the alleged witches. Despite instructions from the Privy Council that another committee should look into the events, no suspects were ever <b>prosecuted</b> <b>for</b> the murder.|$|E

5|$|Drysdale also {{oversaw the}} first civil {{litigation}} trial, {{in which the}} owners of the two ships sought damages from each other. His decision (27 April 1918) found Mont-Blanc entirely at fault. Subsequent appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada (19 May 1919), and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London (22 March 1920), determined Mont-Blanc and Imo were equally to blame for navigational errors that led to the collision. No party was ever convicted for any crime or otherwise successfully <b>prosecuted</b> <b>for</b> any actions that precipitated the disaster.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the first}} trial, freed slave Olaudah Equiano brought {{news of the}} {{massacre}} {{to the attention of}} the anti-slavery campaigner Granville Sharp, who worked unsuccessfully to have the ship's crew <b>prosecuted</b> <b>for</b> murder. Because of the legal dispute, reports of the massacre received increased publicity, stimulating the abolitionist movement in the late 18th and early 19th centuries; the Zong events were increasingly cited as a powerful symbol of the horrors of the Middle Passage of slaves to the New World.|$|E
