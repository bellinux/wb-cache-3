25|$|Before {{the strike}} began (and perhaps {{while it was}} going on), some miners {{proposed}} sending a delegation to the capital, Bucharest, to discuss their problems with {{the leadership of the}} Romanian Communist Party, but this option was discarded as they <b>probably</b> <b>thought</b> any split to two locations would fatally undermine their cause. During the pre-strike period and just as the strike began, certain of the sectoral party chiefs who obstructed the miners' efforts were verbally and even physically assaulted by the miners.|$|E
25|$|Chappell, the {{grandson}} of Victor Richardson, had no doubt been weaned on tales of the Bodyline tour by his grandfather, {{one of the few}} Australian batsmen to fight it out with Larwood and his support bowlers. Forty years later, {{and it was time to}} pay back the Poms. When Keith Fletcher deflected a ball on to his cap and crumpled in a heap as it dropped just short of cover point, Ian Chappell <b>probably</b> <b>thought</b> his grandafther would approve if he had been alive to witness the carnage. One can only hope that the reaction of Vic Richardson – a combative, but essentially a cheerful, sporting cricketer – would have surprised Chappell.|$|E
25|$|The Carthaginian {{leadership}} <b>probably</b> <b>thought</b> Rome {{had been}} defeated and invested little manpower in Sicily. With a small force {{and no money}} to hire new troops, Hamilcar’s strategic goal probably was to maintain a stalemate, as he had neither the resources {{to win the war}} nor the authority to peacefully settle it Hamilcar was in command of a mercenary army composed of multiple nationalities and his ability to successfully lead this force demonstrates his skill as field commander. He employed combined arms tactics, like Alexander and Pyrrhus, and his strategy was similar to the one employed by Quintus Fabius Maximus in the Second Punic War, ironically against Hannibal, the eldest son of Hamilcar Barca, in Italy during 217 BC. The difference was that Fabius commanded a numerically superior army to his opponent, had no supply problems, and had room to manoeuvre, while Hamilcar was mostly static, had a far smaller army than the Romans and was dependent on seaborne supplies from Carthage.|$|E

The Securitron forces capture Edgecrusher in the conclusion. This last song has a very melancholic feel to it. The lyrics are desperate; they are Edgecrusher's words (or <b>probably</b> <b>thoughts)</b> from the jail. We can feel his fear and despair: he lost his battle against {{machines}} and failed in saving mankind.|$|R
25|$|Because {{the book}} was {{published}} anonymously, speculation on the authorship naturally began {{as soon as it}} was released. Many people were suspected, including, Charles Darwin ("I ought to be much flattered & unflattered"), the geologist Charles Lyell, the phrenologist George Combe, as well as many of the people whose work the book often cited. Early on, Sir Richard Vyvyan, the Tory leader of the parliamentary opposition to the Reform Bill, was a popular suspect. Vyvyan held interests in natural philosophy, phrenology, and Lamarckian evolution. Only three years earlier he had privately printed his own evolutionary cosmology, a copy of which he sent to the English anatomist Richard Owen. The latter likely explains the discrepancy between Owen's critical letter to William Whewell on the Vestiges and his flattering letter to the author, whom he <b>probably</b> <b>thought</b> to be Vyvyan. It was even suggested at one point that Prince Albert might have secretly written it. Adam Sedgwick, as well as others, initially thought that the work was likely written by a woman, either Harriet Martineau or the Countess Ada Lovelace. A feminine authorship was thought to explain all of the book's scientific failings.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} of the issues {{surrounding}} Socrates’ conviction, the nature of his affiliation with the Thirty Tyrants is far from straightforward. During the reign of the Thirty, many prominent Athenians who were opposed to the new government left Athens. Robin Waterfield asserts that “Socrates would have been welcome in oligarchic Thebes, where he had close associates among the Pythagoreans who flourished there, and which had already taken in other exiles.” Given the availability of a hospitable host outside of Athens, Socrates, at least in a limited way, chose to remain in Athens. Thus, Waterfield suggests, Socrates’ contemporaries <b>probably</b> <b>thought</b> his remaining in Athens, even without participating in the Thirty’s bloodthirsty schemes, demonstrated his sympathy for the Thirty’s cause, not neutrality towards it. This is proved, Waterfield argues, by the fact that after the Thirty were no longer in power, anyone who had remained in Athens during their rule was encouraged to move to Eleusis, the new home of the expatriate Thirty. Socrates did oppose the will of the Thirty on a few specific occasions. Plato’s Apology has the character of Socrates describe one such instance. He says that the Thirty ordered him, along with four other men, to fetch a man named Leon from Salamis so that the Thirty could execute him. Socrates simply did not answer this order, while the other four men did go to Salamis to get Leon.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{a positive response}} from reviewers. They disagreed over how well Paltrow was used, but generally praised the Brittany–Santana and Kurt–Burt storylines. The Atlantic Kevin Fallon deemed [...] "Sexy" [...] an episode of mixed messages, one which treated the issues it raised with [...] "an appropriate amount of levity", but failed to [...] "play the nuances of the [...] argument as delicately as it <b>probably</b> <b>thought</b> it did." [...] His Atlantic co-writer Patrick Burns criticized the series for glorifying a risqué subject, [...] "then half-heartedly attempt to hammer home a moral." [...] Meghan Brown, also writing for The Atlantic, called it a [...] "solid episode with some strong character moments." [...] Time James Poniewozik felt that the episode [...] "began clumsily, lacked subtlety, involved some embarrassing moments" [...] and focused too much on Paltrow, but as it continued, [...] "achieve {{a few moments of}} delight and honest emotion". Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times described it as [...] "incredibly comprehensive and enjoyable to boot", and IGN Robert Canning said it [...] "avoided preaching and teaching and instead just had some fun and let guest star Gwyneth Paltrow steal all the scenes". Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Glee continues its climb, delicately and successfully marrying actual sex lessons with camp and humor".|$|E

500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review for AllMusic, Erlewine—the website's senior editor—claimed that New York Dolls {{was a more}} quintessential proto-punk album {{than any of the}} Stooges' releases because of how it [...] "plunders history while celebrating it, creating a sleazy urban mythology along the way". David Fricke argued that it was a more definitive glam rock album than David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust (1972) or anything by Marc Bolan because of how the band [...] "captured both the glory and sorrow of glam, the high jinx and wasted youth, with electric photorealism". In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Joe Gross called it an [...] "absolutely essential" [...] record and [...] "epic sleaze, the sound of five young men shaping the big city in their own scuzzy image". Sylvain attributed its influence on punk rock to how Rundgren recorded his guitar through the left speaker and Thunders' guitar on the right side, an orientation which he said younger bands such as the Ramones and the Sex Pistols adopted. Rundgren was amused by how the record became considered a precursor to the punk movement: [...] "The irony is that I wound up producing the seminal punk album, but I was never really thought of as a punk producer, and I never got called by punk acts. They <b>probably</b> <b>thought</b> I was too expensive for what they were going for. But the Dolls didn't really consider themselves punk." ...|$|E

[...] Its conclusion stated [...] "Sluggish gameplay, somewhat washed out colors and textures". IGN praised the replayability, and stated that the sound is faithful to the PC version. Gamezilla criticized the PlayStation 2 version's lack of multiplayer support compared to the PC version along with Game Informer, who said despite its flaws, the game [...] "holds its own {{as one of the best}} FPSs out there." [...] On the other hand, the port scored 3 out of 10 in the television show The Electric Playground (now EP Daily), with the reviewer lauding the audio and graphics but feeling that the controls could have been better implemented, stating: [...] "Control, or lack thereof, is the biggest thorn in the side of Unreal Tournament. The game simply does not play well with the Dual Shock controller. Epic has implemented a dual analog layout (one stick controls movement while the other stick controls aim) which sounds good in theory, but is horrid in practice. We tried to use the Dual Shock layout for a solid hour and ended up doing nothing more than walking into walls and spinning around wildly. The other Unreal Tournament contestants <b>probably</b> <b>thought</b> that our character was possessed." ...|$|E
