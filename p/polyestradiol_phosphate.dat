25|$|Estrogens {{have been}} used in the {{treatment}} of prostate cancer. The estrogens that {{have been used}} include diethylstilbestrol, fosfestrol (diethylstilbestrol diphosphate), ethinylestradiol, ethinylestradiol sulfonate, <b>polyestradiol</b> <b>phosphate,</b> and estradiol undecylate, as well as the combined estrogenic and nitrogen mustard alkylating antineoplastic agent estramustine phosphate. Newer estrogens with improved tolerability and safety like GTx-758 have also been studied. Estrogens are effective in the treatment of prostate cancer because they are functional antiandrogens. They both suppress testosterone concentrations to castrate levels via their antigonadotropic activity and they reduce the percentage of free and bioavailable testosterone by increasing sex hormone-binding globulin production and levels. Estrogens {{have been found to be}} equivalent in effectiveness to androgen deprivation therapy with castration and nonsteroidal antiandrogens. However, they significantly increase cardiovascular mortality, and for this reason, are now little used in prostate cancer. Although the most commonly employed estrogens like diethylstilbestrol and ethinylestradiol are associated with increased cardiovascular mortality, it is notable that certain estrogens, namely <b>polyestradiol</b> <b>phosphate,</b> have been found not to do so; this is attributed to different degrees of effect of the various estrogens on hepatic protein synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Estradiol, estrone, and estriol {{have all}} been {{approved}} as pharmaceutical drugs and are used medically.

50|$|The {{estrogen}} agonist diethylstilbestrol (DES) is occasionally used {{to treat}} prostate cancer through suppression of testosterone production. It was previously used {{in the treatment of}} breast cancer, but has been replaced by more effective and less toxic agents. Estrace is an estrogen which was also formerly used for anti-androgen therapy of prostate cancer. <b>Polyestradiol</b> <b>phosphate</b> is a long-actig derivative of estradiol that is applied as an intramuscular injection.|$|E

50|$|<b>Poly{{estradiol}}</b> <b>phosphate</b> (PEP) (INN, BAN) (brand name Estradurin), {{also known}} as estradiol polymer with phosphoric acid or as estradiol 17β-phosphate polymer, is a synthetic, steroidal estrogen and an estrogen ester {{in the form of}} a polymer - specifically, the 17β-phosphate ester polymer of estradiol - which is used in the treatment of prostate cancer. It is administered via intramuscular injection once a month and acts as a very long-lasting prodrug of estradiol. PEP was introduced by Pfizer in 1957 and has been marketed in the United States and throughout Europe. It is no longer available in the U.S.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} C17β and/or C3 ester prodrugs of {{estradiol}}, such as estradiol acetate, estradiol benzoate, estradiol cypionate, estradiol dipropionate, estradiol enanthate, estradiol undecylate, estradiol valerate, and <b>polyestradiol</b> <b>phosphate</b> (an estradiol ester in polymeric form), among many others, {{have been developed}} and introduced for medical use as estrogens. Estramustine phosphate is also an estradiol ester, but with a nitrogen mustard moiety attached, and is used as an alkylating antineoplastic agent {{in the treatment of}} prostate cancer. Cloxestradiol acetate and promestriene are ether prodrugs of estradiol that have been introduced for medical use as estrogens as well, although they are little known and rarely used.|$|E
50|$|Although {{infrequently}} used {{in modern}} times and although synthetic estrogens like diethylstilbestrol and ethinylestradiol have been more commonly used, estradiol {{is used in the}} treatment of prostate cancer and is similarly effective to other therapies such as androgen deprivation therapy with castration and antiandrogens. It is used {{in the form of the}} long-lasting injected estradiol prodrugs <b>polyestradiol</b> <b>phosphate</b> and estradiol undecylate, and has also more recently been assessed in the form of transdermal estradiol patches. Estrogens are effective in the treatment of prostate cancer by suppressing testosterone levels into the castrate range, increasing levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and thereby decreasing the fraction of free testosterone, and possibly also via direct cytotoxic effects on prostate cancer cells. Parenteral estradiol is largely free of the cardiovascular side effects of the high oral dosages of synthetic estrogens that were used previously. In addition, estrogens may have advantages relative to castration in terms of hot flashes, sexual interest and function, osteoporosis, and cognitive function and may offer significant benefits in terms of quality of life. However, side effects such as gynecomastia and feminization in general may be difficult to tolerate or unacceptable for many men.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: We {{determined}} how serial {{measurements of}} prostate specific antigen and alkaline phosphatase {{can be used}} to predict survival early in the course of hormone treated metastatic prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was based on a prospective randomized trial of 915 patients with metastatic prostate carcinoma designed to compare parenteral estrogen (<b>polyestradiol</b> <b>phosphate)</b> vs total androgen blockade. We included 697 men who survived at least 6 months and had complete serial measurements of prostate specific antigen and alkaline phosphatase. Six models were constructed based on prostate specific antigen and alkaline phosphatase at start, and after 6 months of treatment, alkaline phosphatase flare and relative prostate specific antigen velocity. We constructed time dependent receiver operating characteristic curves with corresponding area under the curve to predict death from prostate cancer within 3 years. RESULTS: The best variables to predict outcome were alkaline phosphatase at 6 months (AUC 0. 79 for <b>polyestradiol</b> <b>phosphate</b> and 0. 72 for total androgen blockade), alkaline phosphatase at baseline (AUC 0. 70 for <b>polyestradiol</b> <b>phosphate</b> and total androgen blockade) and prostate specific antigen at 6 months (AUC 0. 70 for <b>polyestradiol</b> <b>phosphate</b> and total androgen blockade). Prostate specific antigen and alkaline phosphatase levels 6 months after start of treatment give better prediction of survival than baseline levels. CONCLUSIONS: Alkaline phosphatase at start of treatment and alkaline phosphatase and prostate specific antigen after 6 months {{can be used to}} predict survival of hormone treated metastatic prostate cancer...|$|E
40|$|In a {{study of}} the morphologic effects of various steroid hormones on human uterine {{endometrium}} and endometriotic tissue, specimens from 6 women were transplanted subcutaneously into 24 nude mice. In each case, specimens collected simultaneously were transplanted to 4 mice, endometrium to one lateral abdominal wall and endometriotic tissue to the other. All mice were given <b>polyestradiol</b> <b>phosphate</b> subcutaneously the first day after operation. After a 2 -week interval, of each 4 mice, 1 mouse was given <b>polyestradiol</b> <b>phosphate,</b> 1 medroxyprogesterone acetate, 1 danazol, and 1 no further injections. This treatment continued for 8 weeks, after which the mice were killed and the grafts extirpated. Histologic changes in the grafts varied according to the treatment schedule but were very similar in both types of tissue. Our findings suggest that histologic differences between endometrium and endometriotic tissue seen under natural conditions may, at least partly, be due to variations in environmental factors...|$|E
40|$|Paraffin-embedded {{sections}} of 76 human breast tissue specimens were analyzed for estrogen receptors (ER) and endogenous bound estrogen (ER-E). Preincubation of sections with <b>polyestradiol</b> <b>phosphate</b> {{was followed by}} stabilization of the complex with glutaraldehyde. The bound hormone was then visualized by the peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) technique with antiestradiol as the primary antiserum. Normal breast tissue and benign proliferations were consistently positive for ER and ER-E. All specimens were examined for free and bound receptors in cytoplasm and nuclei. Among the carcinomas examined, a high correlation {{was found between the}} presence of ER by the PAP method and by the biochemical analysis of cytosol preparations. The PAP method, requiring no special preparation of surgical specimens, overcomes many of the disadvantages of the cytosol method and adds the advantage of independent evaluation of nuclear and cytoplasmic estrogen binding sites...|$|E
30|$|Robinson et al. {{compared}} the alternatives of orchiectomy and maximal androgen blockage with 1  mg diethylstilbestrol (DES) in 1995 and declared {{no difference in}} terms of progression rate and survival between the two groups (Robinson et al. 1995). In another study conducted by Mikkola et al., orchiectomy and parental <b>polyestradiol</b> <b>phosphate</b> were compared and no difference was reported in terms of progression and survival follow-up for 2  years (Mikkola et al. 1998). Laufer et al. found no benefits in the use of combined androgen blockade (CAB) with medical or surgical castration (Laufer et al. 2000). In addition, a non-steroidal antiandrogen for metastatic PCa was investigated in 20 randomized trials by Crawford et al. which led to the finding that there is a 5 % improvement in the percentage of men surviving 5  years (30 % vs. 25 %) with combined androgen blockade with nonsteroidal antiandrogens, as well as improvements in progression-free survival at 1  year (Crawford et al. 1989).|$|E
40|$|In a histologic {{study of}} human {{endometrium}} transplanted into nude mice, eutopic endometrium from each of 8 women was transplanted subcutaneously to 4 nude mice, 1 of which was treated with <b>polyestradiol</b> <b>phosphate,</b> 1 with MPA, 1 with danazol, and 1 of which was left untreated as a control. Grafts were removed after varying intervals of up to 57 days. Residual histologically evaluable endometrial tissue was found in 32 of the 96 grafts (33 %). None of the extirpated grafts had the same histologic pattern as the eutopic endometrium. Besides confirming that human endometrium can be transplanted into nude mice, {{our findings suggest that}} grafts react histologically {{in the same way as}} eutopic human endometrium to hormone treatment. The specific stroma seems to be crucial to a graft's capacity to respond to hormonal stimuli, and its replacement by fibrous tissue was accompanied by glandular epithelial changes very similar to those seen in human endometriotic lesions...|$|E
40|$|Serum {{concentrations}} of lipoprotein (a) [Lp (a) ] were determined in {{two groups of}} elderly males suffering from prostatic carcinoma, who were randomized to treatment with estrogen (n = 15) or orchidectomy (n = 16). Estrogen was given as oral ethinylestradiol, 150 micrograms daily, combined with intramuscular <b>polyestradiol</b> <b>phosphate,</b> 80 mg/mo. The baseline levels were similar in both groups, but 6 mo after initiation of therapy, serum Lp (a) levels were decreased approximately 50 % in the estrogen-treated group (P less than 0. 001) {{in contrast to a}} 20 % increase (P less than 0. 01) in the orchidectomized group. Concomitantly, LDL cholesterol decreased by 30 % and HDL cholesterol increased by almost 60 % in the estrogen-treated patients. There was no relationship between the change in LDL cholesterol and Lp (a) reduction. In conclusion, Lp (a) levels in males were found to drastically decrease upon estrogen treatment and to increase after orchidectomy, suggesting that sex hormones, and particularly estrogens, exert a regulatory role on the serum Lp (a) level in man...|$|E
40|$|One hundred {{consecutive}} patients aged up to 75 {{with newly}} diagnosed {{cancer of the}} prostate suitable for hormonal treatment were included in a controlled study of the cardiovascular effects of oestrogen versus orchidectomy. In all cases pre-existing cardiovascular morbidity was excluded. Of the 100 patients, 91 were strictly randomised to receive either oestrogen (n = 47) or orchidectomy (n = 44) and 9 (6 given oestrogen, 3 orchidectomy) either chose their own treatment (five cases) or had it selected for them by the urologist (four). Oestrogen was given in the lowest recommended dosage in Sweden [...] namely, as 160 mg <b>polyestradiol</b> <b>phosphate</b> intramuscularly every month {{for the first three}} months, then 80 mg monthly, plus ethinyloestradiol 1 mg by mouth daily for the first two weeks, then 150 micrograms daily. At entry to the study the two treatment groups showed no difference in demographic characteristics or conventional risk factors for cardiovascular disease. During the first year, however, 13 (25 %) of the patients given oestrogen suffered major cardiovascular events as compared with none of the patients after orchidectomy. Patients in the oestrogen treatment group who did not have minor signs of atherosclerosis at entry to the study suffered a similar incidence of cardiovascular complications to those who did have these signs at entry. The substantially increased risk of cardiovascular complications in patients given oestrogen for prostatic cancer warrants careful consideration when choosing treatment for this disorder...|$|E
