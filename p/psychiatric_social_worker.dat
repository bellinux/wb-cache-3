40|$|Social work {{is one of}} {{the core}} mental health professions. With a {{dominance}} of a biological model in psychiatry, the scope of social factors has been relatively marginal. Social factors have been argued to be social work ́s area of expertise. <b>Psychiatric</b> <b>social</b> work is challenged to articulate its unique knowledge and valuable contribution to the field of mental health care since they are coexisting with other more well-established professions. This qualitative study explores how <b>psychiatric</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> and psychiatrists in Goa, India, perceive social work's unique knowledge and its contribution to the field of mental health care. It further explores <b>psychiatric</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> understanding of <b>social</b> factors in relation to mental illness. The empirical material was collected through twelve semi-structured interviews with ten <b>psychiatric</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> and two psychiatrists working in different mental health care settings in Goa. The results show that the main <b>psychiatric</b> <b>social</b> work contributions were described as raising awareness about mental illness and their functioning as a bridge between units. The result further shows a difficulty (among <b>psychiatric</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers)</b> to articulate <b>psychiatric</b> <b>social</b> work's unique knowledge, but during the interviews a specific in-depth knowledge emerged as well as a focus on psychiatric knowledge. Our findings showed that <b>psychiatric</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> understood <b>social</b> factors in terms of social relations. The results are analyzed with Foucault's theory of discourse, Polanyi's theory of tacit knowledge and Ingleheart’s modernization theory. ...|$|R

40|$|Seeking {{to align}} {{psychiatric}} practice with general medicine following {{the inauguration of}} the National Health Service, psychiatric hospitals in post-war Britain deployed new treatments designed to induce somatic change, such as ECT, leucotomy and sedatives.
