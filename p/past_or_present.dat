5|$|Mimas is the {{smallest}} and least massive of the inner round moons, although its mass is sufficient to alter the orbit of Methone. It is noticeably ovoid-shaped, having been made shorter at the poles and longer at the equator (by about 20km) by the effects of Saturn's gravity. Mimas has a large impact crater one-third its diameter, Herschel, situated on its leading hemisphere. Mimas has no known <b>past</b> <b>or</b> <b>present</b> geologic activity, and its surface is dominated by impact craters. The only tectonic features known are a few arcuate and linear troughs, which probably formed when Mimas was shattered by the Herschel impact.|$|E
5|$|By 2012 {{the scandal}} had {{developed}} {{into one of}} the biggest and longest-lived loss-concealing financial scandals in the history of corporate Japan; it had wiped 75–80% off the company's stock market valuation, led to the resignation of much of the board, investigations across Japan, the UK and US, the arrest of 11 <b>past</b> <b>or</b> <b>present</b> Japanese directors, senior managers, auditors and bankers of Olympus for alleged criminal activities or cover-up, and raised considerable turmoil and concern over Japan's prevailing corporate governance and transparency and the Japanese financial markets. Woodford received a reported £10 million ($16 m) in damages from Olympus for defamation and wrongful dismissal in 2012; around the same time, Olympus also announced it would shed 2,700 jobs (7% of its workforce) and around 40 percent of its 30 manufacturing plants by 2015 to reduce its cost base.|$|E

5|$|The entire {{district}} is densely developed, primarily residential in its {{northern and southern}} portions, with commercial use concentrated in central blocks near Monument Square. The only significant open spaces within it are the one-block Washington Park near its southern end and Seminary Park, the main quad at Russell Sage. Most of the major streets and the central area of the district are lined with multi-story dwellings that are primarily commercial but {{with a mix of}} office and residential space on their upper floors. On the side streets, there are smaller-scale residential townhouses. Institutional use is limited to Russell Sage, a few churches, RPI's buildings and governmental structures like the county courthouse and post office. No industrial use, <b>past</b> <b>or</b> <b>present,</b> is within the district, with the notable exception of the Gurley Building, and even that has been scaled back in recent years.|$|E

50|$|Even {{without knowing}} whether time {{travel to the}} past is {{physically}} possible, the grandfather paradox can be explored from a logical perspective. The paradox is a logical contradiction that stems from changing the <b>past</b> (<b>or</b> the <b>present,</b> <b>or</b> the future) from the way it is: if an event has occurred one way, there is no possibility for the event to have occurred a different way. Then, logically, changing the <b>past</b> (<b>or</b> the <b>present,</b> <b>or</b> the future) from what it is results in a contradiction, which means changing the past is impossible. There still exists the logical possibility of travelling {{back in time and}} setting events the way they are, for example a time traveller intending to kill their own grandfather but instead killing someone who is not their grandfather.|$|R

5000|$|The {{construction}} [...] "have/has" [...] + morphologically altered verb (usually {{with the}} suffix -"ed") indicates {{a combination of}} tense and aspect: For example, [...] "have taken'" [...] indicates a present viewing of a <b>past</b> <b>or</b> <b>past</b> and <b>present</b> event, so the continuing relevance of the event is an aspectual feature of the construction. The event in the past could be either stative, habitual, or perfective aspect, but not progressive.|$|R

25|$|Although {{planetary}} geologists {{are interested}} in studying all aspects of other planets, a significant focus is to search for evidence of <b>past</b> <b>or</b> <b>present</b> life on other worlds. This has led to many missions whose primary or ancillary purpose is to examine planetary bodies for evidence of life. One {{of these is the}} Phoenix lander, which analyzed Martian polar soil for water, chemical, and mineralogical constituents related to biological processes.|$|E
25|$|The {{team has}} a zero-tolerance {{approach}} to doping.

Previous team members such as team doctor Geert Leinders, sports director Steven de Jongh and coach Bobby Julich have all left the team when their involvement in doping prior to working with Sky became known.|$|E
