A complex-number form of Fourier series is also commonly used. The concrete formulae above are consequences of a more general mathematical duality called Pontryagin duality. Applied to the group R, it yields the classical Fourier transform; an application in physics are reciprocal lattices, where the underlying group is a finite-dimensional real vector space endowed with the additional datum of a lattice encoding positions of atoms in crystals.|$|E

25|$|While Laplace's {{version of}} {{determinism}} {{is based on}} general terms, Boscovich's uses <b>physical</b> <b>terms,</b> like position, velocity, direction and centre of mass. Boscovich also (correctly) suggests that the continuity of force is a necessary assumption for determinism, and he presented it in strict mathematical form. In short, Boskovich's determinism is more physical, while Laplace's determinism is more metaphysical, placing it in harmony with Leibniz's metaphysics.|$|E

40|$|A {{recently}} developed equation of state, which combines the <b>physical</b> <b>term</b> {{of the classical}} SRK EoS with the association term based on the perturbation theory of Wertheim, called the Cubic Plus Association Equation of State (CPA EoS) (Kontogeorgis et al.

The CPA EoS performs very well in all cases using the conventional van der Waals one-fluid mixing rules in {{the parameters of the}} <b>physical</b> <b>term</b> and a temperature-independent interaction parameter. The performance of the CPA EoS is compared to that of the conventional SRK EoS and UNIFAC models, and with another association model, the ESD EoS of Suresh and Elliott [2]. The CPA EoS gives much better results than the two conventional models and results comparable to those obtained with the ESD model. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R

25|$|In August 1615 Bilson {{was made}} {{a member of the}} Privy Council. In fact, though this was the high point of Bilson's career as courtier, and secured by Somerset's influence, he had been led to expect more earlier that summer. Somerset had been importunate to the point of pushiness on behalf of Bilson, hoping to secure him a higher office, and had left Bilson in a false {{position}} and James very annoyed. This misjudgement was a major step in Somerset's replacement in favour by George Villiers, said to have happened in <b>physical</b> <b>terms</b> under Bilson's roof at Farnham Castle that same August. Bilson died in 1616 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.|$|E
50|$|Quasi-solid or semisolid is the <b>physical</b> <b>term</b> for {{something}} whose state lies between a solid and a liquid.

In general, a nutating plate is carried on a skewed bearing on the main shaft and does not itself rotate, whereas a swashplate is fixed to the shaft and rotates with it.

25|$|The {{concept of}} Heaven in Islam differs {{in many respects}} to the concept in Judaism and Christianity. Heaven is {{described}} primarily in <b>physical</b> <b>terms</b> {{as a place where}} every wish is immediately fulfilled when asked. Islamic texts describe immortal life in Heaven as happy, without negative emotions. Those who dwell in Heaven are said to wear costly apparel, partake in exquisite banquets, and recline on couches inlaid with gold or precious stones. Inhabitants will rejoice in the company of their parents, spouses, and children. In Islam if one's good deeds outweigh one's sins then one may gain entrance to Heaven. Conversely, if one's sins outweigh their good deeds they are sent to hell. The more good deeds one has performed the higher the level of Heaven one is directed to. It has been said that the lowest level of Heaven, the first one, is already over one-hundred times better than the greatest life on Earth. The highest level is the seventh Heaven. Houses are built by angels for the occupants using solid gold.|$|E
500|$|Before the 1980s, it was {{uncommon}} for Japanese women {{to perform on}} traditional instruments, including taiko, as their participation had been systematically restricted. In Ondekoza {{and in the early}} performances of Kodo, women performed only dance routines either during or between taiko performances. Thereafter, female participation in kumi-daiko started to rise dramatically, and by the 1990s, women equaled and possibly exceeded representation by men. While the proportion of women in taiko has become substantial, some have expressed concern that women still do not perform in the same roles as their male counterparts and that taiko performance continues to be a male-dominated profession. For instance, a member of Kodo was informed by the director of the group's apprentice program that women were permitted to play, but could only play [...] "as women". Other women in the apprentice program recognized a gender disparity in performance roles, such as what pieces they were allowed to perform, or in <b>physical</b> <b>terms</b> based on a male standard.|$|E
500|$|Since {{the dawn}} of Newtonian science with its vision of simple {{mechanical}} principles governing the entire universe, some philosophers have been tempted {{by the idea that}} consciousness could be explained in purely <b>physical</b> <b>terms.</b> The first influential writer to propose such an idea explicitly was Julien Offray de La Mettrie, in his book Man a Machine (L'homme machine). [...] His arguments, however, were very abstract. [...] The most influential modern physical theories of consciousness are based on psychology and neuroscience. Theories proposed by neuroscientists such as Gerald Edelman and Antonio Damasio, and by philosophers such as Daniel Dennett, seek to explain consciousness in terms of neural events occurring within the brain. Many other neuroscientists, such as Christof Koch, have explored the neural basis of consciousness without attempting to frame all-encompassing global theories. At the same time, computer scientists working in the field of artificial intelligence have pursued the goal of creating digital computer programs that can simulate or embody consciousness.|$|E

40|$|Physical {{decomposition}} of the non-Abelian gauge field has recently solved the two-decade-lasting {{problem of a}} meaningful gluon spin. Here we extend this approach to gravity and attack the century-lasting problem of a meaningful gravitational energy. The metric is unambiguously separated into a pure geometric term which contributes null curvature tensor, and a <b>physical</b> <b>term</b> which represents the true gravitational effect and always vanishes in a flat space-time. By this decomposition the conventional pseudo-tensors of the gravitational stress-energy are easily rescued to produce definite physical result. Our decomposition applies to any symmetric tensor, and has interesting relation to the transverse-traceless (TT) decomposition discussed by Arnowitt, Deser and Misner, and by York.

2500|$|In <b>physical</b> <b>terms,</b> a {{shock wave}} {{originates}} {{from the point}} of contact. [...] As this shock wave expands, it decelerates and compresses the impactor, and it accelerates and compresses the target. Stress levels within the shock wave far exceed the strength of solid materials; consequently, both the impactor and the target close to the impact site are irreversibly damaged. [...] Many crystalline minerals can be transformed into higher-density phases by shock waves; for example, the common mineral quartz can be transformed into the higher-pressure forms coesite and stishovite. [...] Many other shock-related changes take place within both impactor and target as the shock wave passes through, and some of these changes can be used as diagnostic tools to determine whether particular geological features were produced by impact cratering.|$|E
