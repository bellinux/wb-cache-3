40|$|This paper {{contains}} {{results from}} compatibility studies between AeroMACS and other systems {{operating in the}} same or adjacent frequency bands. These systems are RLAN, AMT, MLS and FSS feeder links. For compatibility with the terrestrial systems, the minimum distance to interferer is calculated, i. e. the minimum distance an interfering transmitter can be from a victim receiver without degrading the system performance beyond a permitted limit. For compatibility with FSS feeder links, the number of AeroMACS systems that may be installed in Europe without causing <b>harmful</b> <b>interference</b> to non-GEO satellite feeder link receivers is calculated. The results {{presented in this paper}} indicate that both MLS and AMT may cause <b>harmful</b> <b>interference</b> to AeroMACS if no precautions are made, while this is unlikely to happen when it comes to RLANs. Concerning compatibility with FSS feeder links, more than about 400 airports in Europe must be equipped with large AeroMACS installations to <b>potentially</b> cause <b>harmful</b> <b>interference</b> to FSS systems...|$|R

5000|$|Daoism is a {{philosophy}} and later also {{developed into a}} religion based on the texts the Tao Te Ching (Dào Dé Jīng; ascribed to Laozi) and the Zhuangzi (partly ascribed to Zhuangzi). The character Dao 道 (Dao) literally means [...] "path" [...] or [...] "way". However, in Daoism it refers more often to a meta-physical term that describes a force that encompasses the entire universe but which cannot be described nor felt. All major Chinese philosophical schools have investigated the correct Way to go about a moral life, but in Taoism it takes on the most abstract meanings, leading this school to be named after it. It advocated nonaction (wu wei), the strength of softness, spontaneity, and relativism. Although {{it serves as a}} rival to Confucianism, a school of active morality, this rivalry is compromised and given perspective by the idiom [...] "practise Confucianism on the outside, Taoism on the inside."Most of Taoism's focus is on what is perceived to be the undeniable fact that human attempts to make the world better actually make the world worse. Therefore, it is better to strive for harmony, minimising <b>potentially</b> <b>harmful</b> <b>interference</b> with nature or in human affairs.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Recent FCC {{proceedings}} {{have considered}} the notion of unlicensed device operation in licensed bands. Licensed users are concerned about <b>harmful</b> <b>interference</b> while unlicensed device manufacturers are concerned that <b>harmful</b> <b>interference</b> is an imprecise design concept. This paper addresses two elements to these concerns. First, it develops an explicit model of <b>harmful</b> <b>interference</b> {{to be included in}} unlicensed device rules. Such a model provides explicit bounded protection to the licensed user while providing assurances and performance goals to the unlicensed device manufacturers. Second, it presents an analytic model for assessing <b>harmful</b> <b>interference</b> that not only provides quantitative analysis, but, also provides insight into how factors such as directional antennas, power control, and licensed channel avoidance strategies affect the aggregate interference. Further, it suggests that complex factors such as unlicensed device modulation schemes can be captured in a simple measurement. These ideas are applied to the notice of proposed rulemaking on Unlicensed Operation in the TV Broadcast Bands.

40|$|Abstract—With the {{transition}} to digital terrestrial television (DTV) in the U. S. scheduled to be complete by 2009, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has issued a notice of proposed rule making (NPRM) that, if adopted, would allow transmission by unlicensed devices on frequencies of vacated television channels. The FCC is required by statute to avoid <b>harmful</b> <b>interference</b> to licensed TV channels. This paper addresses two of the core questions related to the proposed introduction of unlicensed transmissions in the vacated TV channels: Do the proposed rules provide DTV stations adequate protection from interference from these devices? If not, what rules must be adopted to avoid <b>harmful</b> <b>interference</b> to terrestrial DTV service from these devices?

40|$|Background: Older {{people living}} in aged-care {{facilities}} are prescribed more medications than those living in their own homes. Thus, increasing their risk of <b>potentially</b> <b>harmful</b> drug interactions. Few studies have investigated potential drug interactions in residents of aged-care facilities. Aim: To determine the prevalence of <b>potentially</b> <b>harmful</b> drug interactions in long-term residents of aged-care facilities. Method: <b>Potentially</b> <b>harmful</b> drug interactions were investigated using dispensing data from residents of 26 aged-care facilities who received one or more medications from July 2008 to June 2010. Drug interactions analysed were chosen based on their inclusion at the highest severity rating in at least 3 of 4 international drug information resources. Data were compared to findings from a cohort of Australian veterans. Results: <b>Potentially</b> <b>harmful</b> drug interactions were identified for 6. 1 % of the 3876 residents included in the study. A substantially higher incidence than previously reported in Australian veterans (1. 5 %) and certain overseas populations. Interactions involving warfarin, amiodarone, verapamil, lithium and methotrexate had the highest prevalence in aged-care residents, and generally a higher prevalence than in the Australian veteran population. Conclusion: <b>Potentially</b> <b>harmful</b> drug interactions were more prevalent in aged-care residents than in an Australian veteran population. 4 page(s...|$|R

Due to the increasing economic importance of harmful algal blooms, there is need to carry out an inventory of <b>potentially</b> <b>harmful</b> algal species that are present in the Kenyan coastal waters. Phytoplankton samples were collected along the Kenya Coast from 2009 - 2010 and analyzed for species abundance. A total of 39 taxa of <b>potentially</b> <b>harmful</b> algae were encountered over the study period. <b>Potentially</b> <b>harmful</b> algal taxa with high abundance were Chaetoceros sp., Nitzschia sp., Coscinodiscus sp., Pseudo-nitzschia sp., Rhizosolenia sp., Anabaena sp., Protoperidinium sp., Oscillatoria sp. and Trichodesnium sp. whereas the taxa with lowest abundances were Fibrocapsa sp., Chrysochromulina sp., Umezakia sp., Dinophysis sp. and Aphanizomenom sp.
