40|$|In {{this article}} we will show {{how to make a}} (semi-deterministic) <b>photon</b> <b>gun</b> by modifying the {{spontaneous}} decay in a photonic band-gap material. With the help of an intensity-dependent Kerr nonlinearity an excited atom or ion can undergo a transition from inhibited to strongly enhanced spontaneous decay; switched by the application of a strong off-resonant field. We will explore the feasibility of making such a device using Er^ 3 + ions that produce single photons at the important telecommunication wavelength of 1. 55 μm...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{electron}} analog of the single <b>photon</b> <b>gun.</b> On demand single electron injection in a quantum conductor was obtained using a quantum dot connected to the conductor via a tunnel barrier. Electron emission is triggered by application of a potential step which compensates the dot charging energy. Depending on the barrier transparency the quantum emission time ranges from 0. 1 to 10 nanoseconds. The single electron source should prove useful {{for the implementation of}} quantum bits in ballistic conductors. Additionally periodic sequences of single electron emission and absorption generate a quantized AC-current...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we propose to build a (semi-) {{deterministic}} <b>photon</b> <b>gun</b> by modifying the spontaneous decay in a photonic band-gap material. We show that such a device allows for deterministic and unidirectional single-photon emission with a repetition rate {{of the order of}} 100 kHz. We describe a specific realization of the 1 D band-gap model by means of a 3 D photonic-crystal heterostructure and the feasability of implementing such a device using Er 3 + ions that produce single photons at the telecommunication wavelength of 1. 55,m, important for many applications...|$|E
5000|$|WR-03 - a {{brand new}} design. Removes the lock-on feature and forces the player to use a {{powerful}} <b>photon</b> chain <b>gun.</b> Its primary weapons are small guided missiles that swarms the enemies but is weak in terms of hitting power. In the original arcade version, this craft must be unlocked.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a practical {{implementation of a}} (semi-deterministic) <b>photon</b> <b>gun</b> based on stimulated Raman adiabatic passage pumping and the strong enhancement of the photonic density of states in a photonic band-gap material. We show that this device allows deterministic and unidirectional production of single photons with a high repetition rate {{of the order of}} 100 kHz. We also discuss specific 3 D photonic microstructure architectures in which our model can be realized and the feasibility of implementing such a device using Er^ 3 + ions that produce single photons at the telecommunication wavelength of 1. 55 μm.
