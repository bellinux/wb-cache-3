5|$|Breckinridge began reforms {{immediately}} and zealously. He secured the General Assembly's {{passage of a}} two-cent property tax for education. The tax was subject to voter approval, and Breckinridge worked hard to <b>publicize</b> the issue. His efforts paid off, as the tax passed by almost a two-to-one margin. Continuing to <b>publicize</b> needs and push legislators to action, Breckinridge enjoyed the support of {{five of the six}} governors under whom he served. Only John L. Helm, who opposed a state-funded school system, challenged him, but Helm's veto of a Breckinridge educational bill was overridden in the General Assembly. Breckinridge's reforms manifested tangible results. From 1847 to 1850, educational spending increased from $6,000 to $144,000. By 1850, only one out of every ten school age children did not attend school.|$|E

25|$|The Werther effect {{not only}} predicts an {{increase}} in suicide, {{but the majority of}} the suicides will take place in the same or a similar way as the one <b>publicized.</b> The more similar the person in the <b>publicized</b> suicide is to the people exposed to the information about it, the more likely the age group or demographic is to die by suicide. The increase generally happens only in areas where the suicide story was highly <b>publicized.</b> Upon learning of someone else's suicide, some people decide that action may be appropriate for them as well, especially if the <b>publicized</b> suicide was of someone in a similar situation as them.|$|R

40|$|Context: <b>Publicized</b> sobriety {{checkpoint}} programs deter alcohol-impaired {{driving by}} stopping drivers systematically {{to assess their}} alcohol impairment. Sobriety checkpoints were recommended in 2001 by the Community Preventive Services Task Force for reducing alcohol-impaired driving, based on strong evidence of effectiveness. Since the 2001 review, attention to alcohol-impaired driving as a U. S. public health problem has decreased. This systematic review was conducted to determine if available evidence supports the effectiveness of <b>publicized</b> sobriety checkpoint programs in reducing alcohol-impaired driving, given the current context. The economic {{costs and benefits of}} the intervention were also assessed. Evidence acquisition: This review focused on studies that evaluated the effects of <b>publicized</b> sobriety checkpoint programs on alcohol-involved crash fatalities. Using Community Guide methods, a systematic search was conducted for studies published between July 2000 and March 2012 that assessed the effectiveness of <b>publicized</b> sobriety checkpoint programs.
