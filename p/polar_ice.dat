5|$|A <b>polar</b> <b>ice</b> cap, or <b>polar</b> <b>ice</b> sheet, is a high-latitude {{region of}} a planet or moon that is covered in ice. Ice caps form because high-latitude regions receive less energy as solar {{radiation}} from the sun than equatorial regions, resulting in lower surface temperatures.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I explore {{potential}} relationships {{between humans and}} Martian <b>polar</b> <b>ices.</b> Martian ices contain within them multimillion year histories of atmospheric, geological and maybe even biological processes. <b>Polar</b> <b>ices</b> will have many scientific uses, {{as well as providing}} resources for human explorers. Their hydrogen atoms may be used to make methane fuel by combination with carbon atoms from atmospheric carbon dioxide. It would be possible to use the ice as a source of water and also of oxygen in the otherwise anoxic atmosphere. Martian <b>polar</b> <b>ices</b> {{could be used as a}} shield by human explorers: by covering a research station with ice, high energy solar particles could be absorbed, protecting explorers from potentially damaging radiation exposure. Finally, Martian ices provide a substratum over which scientific and exploratory expeditions could traverse on their way to deep field sites and the geographic poles themselves. Martian <b>polar</b> <b>ices</b> have the potential to open a new and unique chapter in the long relationship between humans and ice...|$|R

50|$|A {{satellite}} radar-altimeter is a nadir-looking radar {{with very}} high range resolution, which measures the ocean surface topography with an accuracy {{in the order}} of few centimeters. Additionally, analysis of the echo amplitude and shape can extract information about the wind speed and wave height, respectively.Some radar-altimeters (like CryoSat/SIRAL) employ synthetic aperture and/or interferometric techniques: their reduced footprint allows mapping of rougher surfaces like <b>polar</b> <b>ices.</b>|$|R
5|$|Due to the {{importance}} of the CryoSat mission for understanding global warming and reductions in <b>polar</b> <b>ice</b> caps, a replacement satellite was proposed. The development of CryoSat-2 was authorised in February 2006, less than five months after the failure.|$|E
5|$|CryoSat-2 is {{operated}} {{as part of}} the CryoSat programme to study the Earth's <b>polar</b> <b>ice</b> caps, which is itself part of the Living Planet programme. The CryoSat-2 spacecraft was constructed by EADS Astrium, and was launched by ISC Kosmotras, using a Dnepr carrier rocket, on 8 April 2010. On 22 October 2010, CryoSat-2 was declared operational following six months of on-orbit testing.|$|E
5|$|During the ice ages of {{the last}} two million years the Tibetan plateau and the Himalayas have been covered by the {{expanded}} <b>polar</b> <b>ice</b> cap several times. As the ice moved it eroded the rock, filling the river canyons with gravel. In some sections the rivers have cut through the gravel and flow swiftly over bedrock, and in some areas large boulders have fallen into the rivers and formed rapids.|$|E

5|$|In 1644, the Italian Jesuit Daniello Bartoli {{reported}} seeing two darker patches on Mars. During the oppositions of 1651, 1653 and 1655, when the planet made its closest {{approaches to the}} Earth, the Italian astronomer Giovanni Battista Riccioli and his student Francesco Maria Grimaldi noted patches of differing reflectivity on Mars. The first person to draw a map of Mars that displayed terrain features was the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens. On November 28, 1659 he made an illustration of Mars that showed the distinct dark region now known as Syrtis Major Planum, and possibly one of the <b>polar</b> <b>ice</b> caps. The same year, he succeeded in measuring the rotation period of the planet, giving it as approximately 24 hours. He made a rough estimate of the diameter of Mars, guessing that it is about 60% {{of the size of}} the Earth, which compares well with the modern value of 53%. Perhaps the first definitive mention of Mars's southern <b>polar</b> <b>ice</b> cap was by the Italian astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini, in 1666. That same year, he used observations of the surface markings on Mars to determine a rotation period of 24h 40m. This differs from the currently-accepted value by less than three minutes. In 1672, Huygens noticed a fuzzy white cap at the north pole.|$|E

5|$|The Köppen {{classification}} {{depends on}} average monthly values of temperature and precipitation. The {{most commonly used}} form of the Köppen classification has five primary types labeled A through E. Specifically, the primary types are A, tropical; B, dry; C, mild mid-latitude; D, cold mid-latitude; and E, polar. The five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as rain forest, monsoon, tropical savanna, humid subtropical, humid continental, oceanic climate, Mediterranean climate, steppe, subarctic climate, tundra, <b>polar</b> <b>ice</b> cap, and desert.|$|E

5|$|The first {{telescopic}} {{observation of}} Mars was by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Within a century, astronomers discovered distinct albedo {{features on the}} planet, including the dark patch Syrtis Major Planum and <b>polar</b> <b>ice</b> caps.

In general, ice cores from non-polar locations contained larger numbers and species of cultivable bacteria than samples from <b>polar</b> <b>ices,</b> presumably due to the closer proximity of terrestrial biological ecosystems and exposed landscape.

5|$|Nansen {{first began}} to {{consider}} the possibility of reaching the North Pole by using the natural drift of the <b>polar</b> <b>ice</b> when, in 1884, he read the theories of Henrik Mohn, the distinguished Norwegian meteorologist. Artifacts found on the Greenland coast had been identified as coming from the lost US Arctic exploration vessel Jeannette, which had been crushed and sunk in June 1881 {{on the opposite side of}} the Arctic Ocean, off the Siberian coast. Mohn surmised that the location of the artefacts indicated the existence of an ocean current, flowing from east to west all the way across the polar sea, possibly over the pole itself. A strong enough ship might therefore enter the frozen Siberian sea, and drift to the Greenland coast via the pole.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1928, she {{assisted}} in the search effort for the wrecked airship Italia, which had crashed on the <b>polar</b> <b>ice</b> northeast of Svalbard. In addition, Roald Amundsen, who had also joined the search effort, went missing himself. Strassbourg arrived in Tromsø, Norway, on 19 June, to search for both Italia and Amundsen's aircraft. The ship's bow was not designed to operate in an Arctic environment, and so the crew had to continually fix wood planks to the hull {{to protect it from}} the ice. While refueling from the tanker Durance, Strassbourg took on two FBA 17 seaplanes to assist in the search effort. On 30 August, Strassbourg located one of the floats from Amundsen's aircraft, confirming the loss of the plane. The search effort was called off on 17 September, and Strassbourg returned to Brest by way of Reykjavík, arriving back in France by mid October.|$|E
5|$|At {{atmospheric}} pressure, {{molecular nitrogen}} condenses (liquefies) at 77K (−195.79°C) and freezes at 63K (−210.01°C) into the beta hexagonal close-packed crystal allotropic form. Below 35.4K (−237.6°C) nitrogen assumes the cubic crystal allotropic form (called the alpha phase). Liquid nitrogen, a colourless fluid resembling water in appearance, but with 80.8% of the density (the density of liquid nitrogen at its boiling point is 0.808g/mL), {{is a common}} cryogen. Solid nitrogen has many crystalline modifications. It forms a significant dynamic surface coverage on Pluto and outer moons of the Solar System such as Triton. Even at the low temperatures of solid nitrogen it is fairly volatile and can sublime to form an atmosphere, or condense back into nitrogen frost. It is very weak and flows {{in the form of}} glaciers and on Triton geysers of nitrogen gas come from the <b>polar</b> <b>ice</b> cap region.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of Mars is eccentric, its {{apparent}} magnitude at opposition from the Sun can range from −3.0 to −1.4. The minimum brightness is magnitude +1.6 when the planet is {{in conjunction with the}} Sun. Mars usually appears distinctly yellow, orange, or red; the actual color of Mars is closer to butterscotch, and the redness seen is just dust in the planet's atmosphere. NASA's Spirit rover has taken pictures of a greenish-brown, mud-colored landscape with blue-grey rocks and patches of light red sand. When farthest away from Earth, it is more than seven times farther away than when it is closest. When least favorably positioned, it can be lost in the Sun's glare for months at a time. At its most favorable times—at 15- or 17-year intervals, and always between late July and late September—a lot of surface detail can be seen with a telescope. Especially noticeable, even at low magnification, are the <b>polar</b> <b>ice</b> caps.|$|E
5|$|Mars is {{the only}} planet in the Solar System on which deserts have been identified. Despite its low surface {{atmospheric}} pressure (only 1/100 of that of the Earth), the patterns of atmospheric circulation on Mars have formed a sea of circumpolar sand more than 5 million km² (1.9million sq mi) in area, much larger than deserts on Earth. The Martian deserts principally consist of dunes {{in the form of}} half-moons in flat areas near the permanent <b>polar</b> <b>ice</b> caps in the north of the planet. The smaller dune fields occupy the bottom of many of the craters situated in the Martian polar regions. Examination of the surface of rocks by laser beamed from the Mars Exploration Rover have shown a surface film that resembles the desert varnish found on Earth although it might just be surface dust. The surface of Titan, a moon of Saturn, also has a desert-like surface with dune seas.|$|E
5|$|Water is a {{chemical}} substance that {{is composed of}} hydrogen and oxygen and is vital for all known forms of life.

On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large water bodies, with 1.6% of water below ground in aquifers and 0.001% {{in the air as}} vapor, clouds, and precipitation. Oceans hold 97% of surface water, glaciers, and <b>polar</b> <b>ice</b> caps 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%. Additionally, a minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.|$|E
