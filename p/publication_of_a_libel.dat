50|$|The <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> obscene <b>libel</b> was <b>an</b> offence {{under the}} common law of England.

50|$|In 1841 Edward Moxon {{was found}} guilty <b>of</b> the <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> blasphemous <b>libel</b> (Percy Bysshe Shelley's Queen Mab), the {{prosecution}} having been instituted by Henry Hetherington, who had previously been condemned to four months imprisonment for a similar offence, and wished to test the law under which he was punished. In the case of Cowan v Milbourn (1867) the defendant had broken his contract to let a lecture-room to the plaintiff, on discovering that the intended lectures were to maintain that the character of Christ is defective, and his teaching misleading, and that the Bible is no more inspired than any other book, and the court of exchequer held that the <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> such doctrine was blasphemy, and the contract therefore illegal. On that occasion the court reaffirmed the dictum of Lord Chief Justice Hale, that Christianity {{is part of the}} laws of England.The commissioners on criminal law (sixth report) remarked that although the law forbade all denial of the being and providence of God or the Christian religion, it is only when irreligion assumes the form <b>of</b> <b>an</b> insult to God and man that the interference of the criminal law took place.|$|R

5000|$|This section {{allowed the}} {{defendant}} {{to prove the}} truth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>libel</b> as <b>a</b> valid defence in criminal proceedings, but only if it also be demonstrated that <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> the libel was to the [...] "Public Benefit". Proving the statement's truth had previously been allowed only in civil libel defences inasmuch as the criminal offence against {{the public at large}} was considered to be provoking <b>a</b> breach <b>of</b> peace via printing malicious statements rather than the defamation per se; the truth or falsity of the statement had therefore been considered irrelevant in criminal proceedings before the Act.|$|R

500|$|In Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co.

50|$|A {{more serious}} charge which Healy repeated, and {{apparently}} thought credible, was that O'Brien once took a bribe {{to influence the}} outcome <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>libel</b> action; such <b>a</b> charge <b>of</b> corruption is almost without precedent {{in the history of}} the Irish judiciary.

5000|$|People v. Spielman (1925) upheld same statute {{as the one}} in Beauharnais. In {{this case}}, <b>publications</b> defamed members <b>of</b> the Knights of Columbus, falsely {{assigning}} an oath to them. In this case the defendant was found guilty <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>libel</b> on both “the membership of the American Legion and certain named members of that organization.” [...] The holding that individual members were libeled relied on doctrine from the Osborne case. Though these individual members were not named in the publication, their ties to the legion gave them adequate claim to <b>a</b> criminal <b>libel</b> offense. These three cases played a large role in solidifying the American conception of group libel law as it was interpreted in the Beauharnais case.|$|R
