500|$|John Locke in his Essays on the Law of Nature {{argued that}} the {{widespread}} fact of human conscience allowed a philosopher to infer the necessary existence of objective moral laws that occasionally might contradict those of the state. Locke highlighted the metaethics problem of whether accepting a statement like [...] "follow your conscience" [...] supports subjectivist or objectivist conceptions of conscience as a guide in concrete morality, or as a spontaneous revelation of eternal and immutable principles to the individual: [...] "if conscience be a proof of innate principles, contraries may be innate principles; since some men with the same bent of conscience prosecute what others avoid." [...] Thomas Hobbes likewise pragmatically noted that opinions formed {{on the basis of}} conscience with full and honest conviction, nevertheless should always be accepted with humility as potentially erroneous and not necessarily indicating absolute knowledge or truth. William Godwin expressed the view that conscience was a memorable consequence of the [...] "perception by men of every creed when the descend into the scene of busy life" [...] that they possess free will. Adam Smith considered that it was only by developing a critical conscience that we can ever see what relates to ourselves in its proper shape and dimensions; or that we can ever make any <b>proper</b> <b>comparison</b> between our own interests and those of other people. John Stuart Mill believed that idealism about the role of conscience in government should be tempered with a practical realisation that few men in society are capable of directing their minds or purposes towards distant or unobvious interests, of disinterested regard for others, and especially for what comes after them, for the idea of posterity, of their country, or of humanity, whether grounded on sympathy or on a conscientious feeling. Mill held that certain amount of conscience, and of disinterested public spirit, may fairly be calculated on in the citizens of any community ripe for representative government, but that [...] "it would be ridiculous to expect such a degree of it, combined with such intellectual discernment, as would be proof against any plausible fallacy tending to make that which was for their class interest appear the dictate of justice and of the general good." ...|$|E

Module-trait relationships revealed that almost all 9 modules had different SCI-induced expression patterns depending on the genotype (Fig.  2 D). To better evaluate expression changes of each module at different time points post SCI, 21 additional WT SCI samples were collected from 1, 3, 7, 14, 28 and 42 d post-injury for RNAseq. Averaged expression of the top 30 hub-genes from the above 9 modules was used to plot the time course of these modules post-injury (Fig.  2 E). Bar plots were added to demonstrate module dynamic changes in WT and SCID samples before and 6 weeks after SCI.
