Thus the whole shape of the walls' mass being square, it is well, still {{for the sake of}} contrast, to oppose it not only by the element of curvature, in the ring, and lines of the roof below, but by that of sharpness; hence the pleasure which the eye takes in the projecting point of the roof. Also, because the walls are thick and sturdy, it is well to contrast their strength with weakness; therefore we enjoy the evident decrepitude of this roof as it sinks between them. The whole mass being nearly white, we want a contrasting shadow somewhere; and get it, under our piece of decrepitude. This shade, with the tiles of the wall below, forms another <b>pointed</b> <b>mass,</b> necessary to the first by the law of repetition. Hide this inferior angle with your finger, and see how ugly the other looks. A sense of the law of symmetry, though you might hardly suppose it, has some share in the feeling with which you look at the battlements; there is a certain pleasure in the opposed slopes of their top, on one side down to the left, on the other to the right. Still less would you think the law of radiation {{had anything to do with}} the matter: but if you take the extreme point of the black shadow on the left for a center, and follow first the low curve of the eaves of the wall, it will lead you, if you continue it, to the point of the tower cornice; follow the second curve, the top of the tiles of the wall, and it will strike the top of the right-hand battlement; then draw a curve from the highest point of the angled battlement on the left, through the points of the roof and its dark echo; and you will see how the whole top of the tower radiates from this lowest dark point. There are other curvatures crossing these main ones, to keep them from being too conspicuous. Follow the curve of the upper roof, it will take you to the top of the highest battlement; and the stones indicated at the right-hand side of the tower are more extended at the bottom, in order to get some less direct expression of sympathy, such as irregular stones may be capable of, with the general flow of the curves from left to right.|$|E
50|$|Armor-piercing {{rifle and}} pistol {{cartridges}} are usually {{built around a}} penetrator of hardened steel, tungsten, or tungsten carbide, and such cartridges are often called 'hard-core bullets'. Aircraft and tank rounds sometimes use a core of depleted uranium. The penetrator is a <b>pointed</b> <b>mass</b> of high-density material {{that is designed to}} retain its shape and carry the maximum possible amount of energy as deeply as possible into the target. Depleted-uranium penetrators have the advantage of being pyrophoric and self-sharpening on impact, resulting in intense heat and energy focused on a minimal area of the target's armor. Some rounds also use explosive or incendiary tips to aid in the penetration of thicker armor. High Explosive Incendiary/Armor Piercing Ammunition combines a tungsten carbide penetrator with an incendiary and explosive tip.|$|E

The problem of finding an optimal angle of launching a <b>point</b> <b>mass</b> in a medium with quadratic drag force is considered. An equation for determining a value of this angle is obtained.

40|$|A {{gravitational}} lens {{system can be}} perturbed by "rogue systems" in angular proximities but at different distances. A <b>point</b> <b>mass</b> perturbed by another <b>point</b> <b>mass</b> {{can be considered as}} a large separation approximation of the double scattering two <b>point</b> <b>mass</b> (DSTP) lens. The resulting effective lens depends on whether the perturber is closer to or farther from the observer than the main lens system. The caustic is smaller than that of the large separation binary lens when the perturber is the first scatterer; the caustic is similar in size with the large separation binary lens when the perturber is the last scatterer.

It is readily seen that the underlying measures in two recently-proposed methods for estimating the m frequencies, θj, of a discrete-time trigonometric signal using Szegö polynomials are of this form. We prove existence of Szegö polynomial limits associated with a general class of weakly convergent measures, and prove that for convolution of <b>point</b> <b>masses</b> with the Poisson kernel, which underlies one of the recently-proposed methods, the limit has as a factor the Szegö polynomial {{with respect to a}} related measure, which we specify.
