Annular ring <b>patch</b> <b>antennas</b> are reported to reduce antenna size. In this paper, several novel compact probe-fed annular-ring microstrip <b>patch</b> <b>antennas</b> are presented. In {{order to reduce the}} antenna size and provide a suitable input impedance match, two techniques are employed; the insertion of strips into the annular ring and placing a cross-slot into the ground plane. The proposed annular-ring <b>patch</b> <b>antennas</b> with a cross-slotted ground plane yield a much smaller size for a given frequency and are easily matched to 50 Ohms. These novel <b>patch</b> <b>antennas</b> can effectively be reduced by about 55 percent in size compared to conventional annular-ring <b>patch</b> <b>antennas.</b> The antenna can be designed for single band circular-polarization, dual-band circular polarization, triple band, or wideband operation, depending on parameter selection. Some significant advantages are evident for these structures, such as the centre-frequency exhibiting weak dependence on the position of the feedpoint as well as compact size. Good circularly polarized properties and wide CP bandwidths are obtained for these compact antennas. The multiband versions can provide small frequency ratios.

40|$|Conventional singly-fed {{circularly polarised}} (SFCP) {{microstrip}} <b>patch</b> <b>antennas</b> have inherent disadvantages: (i) limited impedance bandwidth and (ii) very narrow axial-ratio bandwidth.

Over the past decades, a number of bandwidth broadening techniques have been proposed by patch researchers.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{original work}} on the broadband and multiband matching of microstrip <b>patch</b> <b>antennas.</b> Microstrip <b>patch</b> <b>antennas</b> suffer from many constraints on their performance. One major restriction is their narrow impedance bandwidth. An effective method to resolve this is adding more resonators to the antenna structure to achieve multi-resonance and hence wider bandwidth. Structures such as circular, square and triangular <b>patch</b> <b>antennas</b> may support two orthogonal resonant modes or polarisations. This allows excitation of an additional resonance beside the fundamental. With the correct coupling between the resonant modes, the impedance bandwidth can be significantly increased. The equivalent circuit of such structures is {{similar to those used}} in microwave filter design. Using techniques normally employed in filter synthesis, the equivalent circuits can be generated, and aid in finding the couplings and dimensions of the specified antenna requirement. The bandwidth of circular microstrip <b>patch</b> <b>antennas</b> is significantly increased by exciting two modes on a single circular microstrip antenna, and four modes using two stacked circular microstrip patches. In this work, the designs are also extended into multimode antennas achieving multi-frequency operation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
