The strain does not contain marker genes typical of hospital-associated isolates responsible for clinical infections and is susceptible to clinically relevant antibiotics, except for kanamycin which is considered of no concern. There were no adverse effects seen in calves when Cylactin® was administered at a 100 -fold overdose. Consequently, Cylactin® is considered safe <b>for</b> calves <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and <b>for</b> rearing at the recommended dose. This conclusion was extended to kids <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and rearing.

The identity of the six strains was established. As no antibiotic resistance of concern was detected and as five of the strains qualify for the Qualified Presumption of Safety approach to safety assessment, their use is presumed safe for target species and consumers. The Enterococcus faecium strain is not a recognised pathogen for animals and as the additive did not adversely affect growth of chickens or piglets, Probiotic LACTINA® is considered safe for the target species up to 1 x 1010 CFU/kg feed. The E. faecium strain does not contain marker genes typical of hospital-associated isolates responsible for clinical infections. The metabolic pathways of E. faecium are well known.

40|$|The {{additive}} hydroxy-analogue of selenomethionine {{consists of}} synthetic R,S- 2 -hydroxy- 4 -methylselenobutanoic acid (HMSeBA) and {{is intended to}} be used as a source of the essential trace element selenium for all animal species/categories. Based on data from tolerance studies in chickens and turkeys <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and piglets, the additive is considered as safe for all species/categories up to the maximum authorised total selenium level in complete feed. After being absorbed, HMSeBA is metabolised to selenomethionine; consequently, no residues of the compound itself occur in animal tissues and products. Compared with inorganic selenium sources, the use of HMSeBA in animal nutrition would result in a similar increase in selenium deposition in animal tissues/products as that resulting from selenised yeast. To ensure consumer safety from consumption of food originating from animals supplemented with HMSeBA, the FEEDAP Panel concluded that selenium supplementation from the additive should not exceed a maximum of 0. 2 mg Se/kg complete feed. The additive should be regarded as an eye irritant, but should not be classified as skin irritant or skin sensitiser. Inhalation exposure poses a hazard to users; the FEEDAP Panel concludes, therefore, that the formulation and conditions of use of the solid form of the additive should minimise user exposure by inhalation. The use of HMSeBA in feed does not pose an additional risk to the environment, compared to other sources of selenium for which it will substitute, as long as the maximum authorised content in feedingstuffs is not exceeded. Based on the response of plasma glutathione peroxidase activity and the plasma/liver concentration of selenium in chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and <b>pigs</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening,</b> the FEEDAP Panel considers that HMSeBA is an efficaceous source of selenium for all animal species/categories.

Considering {{the purity of the}} L-selenomethionine (L-SeMet) under application and the metabolic pathways of SeMet, the FEEDAP Panel considers the use of L-SeMet as safe for all animal species, provided that the maximum total selenium level authorised in feed is respected. The use of in animal nutrition is expected to result in a similar increase in selenium deposition in animal tissues/products as that resulting from other sources of SeMet. To ensure consumer safety from consumption of food originating from animals fed L-SeMet, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that dietary selenium supplementation from the additive should not exceed a maximum of 0. 2 mg Se/kg complete feed.

40|$|The additive, {{based on}} a single {{bacterial}} strain (DSM 11798), is intended for use in feeds <b>for</b> <b>pig</b> to reduce the epoxide group of contaminating trichothecene mycotoxins to a less toxic metabolite. To establish an identity for the strain a phylogenetic analysis was made based on the genomic sequence of the strain and 24 genome sequences available for the family Coriobacteriaceae. The three approaches used consistently suggested an assignment to a new taxonomic unit within the family Coriobacteriaceae. The Panel accepts that a new species and/or genus {{may have to be}} established. In the interim the deposition of the bacterium in a European culture collection is sufficient to ensure that any authorisation would apply only to the additive under application. Based on the results of a tolerance study the additive is considered safe <b>for</b> piglets and <b>pigs</b> <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> at the maximum dose proposed. The live organism is not expected to present a hazard for consumers and the negative findings in a series of genotoxicity and oral toxicity tests indicates that toxic metabolites are not produced. Since the additive is expected to act only by the biotransformation of trichothecene mycotoxins to less toxic forms, no hazards for consumers would arise from the use of the additive in animal production. The additive was non-irritant to eyes and skin and was not a skin sensitiser, but the potential for respiratory sensitization cannot be excluded. As the strain has a very limited capability to survive in aerobic conditions, its use in animal production is unlikely to introduce an environmental concern.

Con estos resultados se concluye que la dieta suplementada con BS tiene un efecto positivo sobre la morfometría intestinal en cuyes de engorde, siendo evidentes mejoras en la relación L/P de los tres segmentos intestinales, apoyándose en vellosidades más largas y criptas menos profundas, siendo esta respuesta más consistente para el T 5...|$|R
50|$|Frankfurt's Forest District ranged over 22.123 morgen (4480 hectare). The City Forest, {{belonging}} to Frankfurt since 1372, {{was the most}} important part of the district. It was situated south of the river Main, stretching out over almost 40 square kilometers. The Riederwald, located south of Bornheim, as well as the exclave Hohemark in Taunus, which had been part of Niedererlenbach, Bonames, Niederursel and Dortelweil, also belonged to the forest district. While the use of forests <b>for</b> <b>pig</b> <b>fattening</b> became less important, the wood harvest was one of the major economic factors.

It is presently authorised for use with chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> at a minimum dose of 1 x 107 CFU/kg of complete feedingstuffs. The applicant is now seeking authorisation for use with chickens reared for laying, ducks <b>for</b> <b>fattening,</b> quails, pheasants, partridges, guinea fowl, pigeons, geese <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and ostriches. B. subtilis is a species that is considered by EFSA to be suitable for Qualified Presumption of Safety (QPS) approach to safety assessment. The sensitivity to antibiotics {{and the absence of}} toxigenic potential qualified the strain for QPS status. On this basis the product can be presumed safe for chickens reared for laying, ducks <b>for</b> <b>fattening,</b> quails, pheasants, partridges, guinea fowl, pigeons, geese <b>for</b> <b>fattening,</b> and ostriches, <b>for</b> consumers of products derived from thes...|$|R

This product is authorised for use in chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> as a zootechnical additive, functional group of digestibility enhancers. The applicant seeks for {{the extension of the}} use of the additive to chickens reared for laying and to minor poultry species <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> at a dose range of 50 to 100 alpha-galactosidase units and of 285 to 570 glucanase units per kg feed (corresponding to 50 to 100 mg additive/kg feed). In a previous evaluation the additive was shown to be safe in chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> at a dose of 100 galactosidase and 570 glucanase units per kg feed. The FEEDAP Panel considers that this conclusion can be extended to chickens reared for laying. Given the margin of safety established for the major species, these conclusions can be extrapolated to minor poultry species <b>for</b> <b>fattening.</b> The potential of the product to be efficacious when used in chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> was previously established at the dose of  50 U galactosidase and 285 U glucanase per kg feed. The FEEDAP Panel considers that this conclusion applies to chickens reared for laying.

40|$|A {{total of}} 152 pig farms were {{randomly}} selected from the five provinces in South Korea. During the experiment, the average temperature and relative humidity was 24. 7 °C and 74 % in summer and 2. 4 °C and 53 % in winter, respectively. The correlation between floor space allowance (FSA) and productivity index was analyzed, including non-productive sow days (NPD), number of weaners (NOW), survival rate (SR), appearance rate of A-grade pork (ARA), and days at a slaughter weight of 110 kg (d-SW) at different growth stages. The objectives of the present study were i) to determine the effect of FSA on the pig productivity index and ii) to suggest the minimum FSA <b>for</b> <b>pigs</b> based on scientific baseline data. For the pregnant sow, NPD could be decreased if pregnant sows were raised with a medium level (M) of FSA (3. 10 to 3. 67 m 2 /head) while also keeping the pig house clean which improves hygiene, and operating the ventilation system properly. For the farrowing sows, the NOW tended to decrease as the FSA increased. Similarly, a high level of FSA (H) is significantly negative with weaner SR of farrowing sows (p-value = 0. 017), indicating this FSA tends to depress SR. Therefore, a FSA of 2. 30 to 6. 40 m 2 /head (very low) could be appropriate for weaners because a limited space can provide a sense of security and protection from external interruptions. The opposite trend was observed that an increase in floor space (> 1. 12 m 2 /head) leads to increase the SR of growing <b>pigs.</b> <b>For</b> the <b>fattening</b> <b>pigs,</b> H level of FSA was negatively correlated with SR, but M level of FSA was positively correlated with SR, indicating that SR tended to increase with the FSA of 1. 10 to 1. 27 m 2 /head. In contrast, ARA of male fattening pigs showed opposite results. H level of FSA (1. 27 to 1. 47 m 2 /head) was suggested to increase productivity because ARA was most affected by H level of space allowance with positive correlation (R 2 = 0. 523). The relationship between the FSA and d-SW of fattening pigs was hard to identify because of the low R 2 value. However, the farms that provided a relatively large floor space (1. 27 to 1. 54 m 2 /head) during the winter period showed d-SW was significantly and negatively affected by FSA...|$|R
40|$|Miya-Gold is an {{additive}} containing viable spores of {{a single}} strain of Clostridium butyricum as the active agent. It is presently authorised for use in diets for weaned piglets, minor weaned porcine species, chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and minor avian species <b>for</b> <b>fattening.</b> The applicant is now seeking to reduce the minimum authorised dose from 5 x 108 CFU/kg feed to 2. 5 x 108 CFU/kg feed when used with chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> and all minor avian species (except laying birds) and to extend this authorisation to chickens reared for laying. The safety for the consumers, users of the product and the environment has been previously assessed by EFSA {{and found that it}} did not raise concerns. In a previous opinion the FEEDAP Panel concluded that the additive is safe <b>for</b> chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> when used at the then recommended dose. The Panel considers that this conclusion can be extended to chickens reared for laying. This conclusion can be taken to apply to the revised dose for all of species under application. The data from three trials made with chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> confirmed the effectiveness of the additive when used at the currently authorised dose of 5 x 108 CFU/kg feed. Effects with the reduced dose of 2. 5 x 108 CFU/kg feed were less clear and showed significantly positive results in only two of the five trials in which this dose was tested. However, a meta-analysis made by pooling results from the five trials showed significant gains in final body weight and improved feed conversion indicating that the additive had some potential to improve performance of chickens <b>for</b> <b>fattening</b> at the lower dose.
