40|$|Re-authorization of <b>processed</b> <b>animal</b> <b>proteins</b> (PAPs) in EU, {{derived from}} {{by-products}} of human food production, could increase manufacturing of proteins for feed ingredients {{and reduce the}} need of imported proteins mainly of plant origin. The PAPs production is largely done by the rendering process during which authorized animal by-products are heat treated to extract valuable protein and animal fat, ensuring sterilizing conditions of raw incoming materials. Proteins exposure to certain processing conditions induces two important chemical changes, racemization of amino acids and formation of cross-linked amino acid. These changes are associated with appreciable reduction of protein digestibility and nutritional value. The {{aim of this study}} was to verify the effect of heat treatment on amino acid racemization in <b>processed</b> <b>animal</b> <b>proteins</b> of poultry origin and related nutritional implications by evaluation of their in vitro digestibility. The results reported confirm the detection of racemized amino acids in <b>processed</b> <b>animal</b> <b>proteins,</b> especially D-aspartic acid, as realistic indicators of thermal treatments during PAP manufacturing. In our results, the severe (115 °C) and prolonged heat treatment (180 minutes) revealed a D-Asp content of 28. 1 %. Prolongation of temperature treatment (20, 30 and 180 min, at 115 °C) significantly (P< 0. 05) affects in vitro protein digestibility, which decrease from 86. 0 %, in no-treated sample, to 78. 3 % and 79. 1 % after 20 and 30 min, respectively, and to 76. 3 % after 180 min. The processing conditions applied during PAPs preparations and the racemization of proteins amino acids may reasonably be involved in the loss of protein quality...|$|E

The EU Council Decision of 4 December 2000 forbade use of <b>processed</b> <b>animal</b> <b>protein</b> to make feeds for cattle, swine, and poultry. Meat and bone meal (MBM) is rich in macro- and microelements {{as well as in}} organic substance, and hence it can be a viable alternative to mineral fertilizers containing N and P. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of increasing doses of MBM applied every second year as an organic fertilizer on maize (Tea mays L.) grown for grain. A two-factorial field experiment with a randomized block design was carried out in 20102011, in north-eastern Poland. Experimental factor I was MBM dose (2. 0, 3. 0, 4. 0, and 5. 0 Mg ha- 1 applied every second year), and experimental factor II was the year of the study (two consecutive years). Increasing MBM doses applied every second year increased maize grain yield and improved grain plumpness, in comparison with mineral fertilization. The highest yield-forming effect was observed when MBM was applied at 3 Mg ha- 1. Macronutrient uptake by maize plants and macronutrient concentrations in maize grain were affected by the year of the study rather than MBM dose. The results of a 2 -yr experiment indicate that MBM is a valuable source of N and P for maize grown for grain, and that it is equally or more effective when compared with mineral fertilizers...|$|R

40|$|Directive 2003 / 126 /EC {{defines the}} method for the {{determination}} of constituents of animal origin for official control of feedingstuffs. One of the hardest problems for microscopist is the differentiation between mammalian and poultry bones {{on the basis of}} some characteristics as colour and borders of the fragments, shape and density of osteocyte lacunae. The shape of osteocyte lacuna in poultry and mammals is often described in different way, elliptic or roundish according with the Author(s). The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the characteristics of lacunae in chicken bones of different type. For this purpose, smashed fragments and histological sections of the same bone were compared in order to evaluate the microscopic aspect of lacunae in different breaking and trimming planes. According to the observations carried out, it was possible to infer that chicken osteocyte has a biconvex lens shape; however the different arrangement and some size variation of the osteocytes in the several bone segments influence the microscopic features of corresponding lacunae. Chicken bone is made of a parallel-fibered tissue, without osteons. This structure probably determines the plane fracture of the bone and consequently the different aspect of lacunae (from spindle-shaped to elliptic-roundish) we can see in chicken derived PAP (<b>processed</b> <b>animal</b> <b>protein).</b> For example, in the fragments obtained from smashed diaphysis, the prevalence of spindle-shaped lacunae is depending on the preferential breaking of the bone along longitudinal plane. Likewise, for the epiphysis, being made mostly by bone trabeculae with strange directions, the breaking happens along different planes, creating lacunae of various shape. Performing the official check of animal feedingstuffs, the presence of bone fragments with roundish or elliptic osteocyte lacunae induces the analyst to thinking that the meat and bone meal comes respectively from mammals and poultry or vice versa depending to the reference Author(s); apart from the final evaluation (also based on some other features of the fragments), it is important to consider that the chicken bones could show lacunae of different shapes (spindle, elliptic and roundish), in accordance with the type and the breaking of the involved skeleton segments...|$|R
