25|$|There {{were three}} {{suggested}} reaction mechanisms of the Baeyer–Villiger oxidation {{that seemed to}} fit with observed reaction outcomes. These three reaction mechanisms can really be split into two pathways of peroxyacid attack - on either the oxygen or the carbon of the carbonyl group. Attack on oxygen could lead to two possible intermediates: Baeyer and Villiger suggested a dioxirane intermediate, while Georg Wittig and Gustav Pieper suggested a peroxide with no dioxirane formation. Carbon attack was suggested by Rudolf Criegee. In this pathway, the <b>peracid</b> attacks the carbonyl carbon, producing what {{is now known as}} the Criegee intermediate.|$|E

40|$|Background/Aims: Protein {{tyrosine}} phosphatases {{are crucial}} enzymes controlling numerous physiological and pathophysiological events {{and can be}} regulated by oxidation of the catalytic domain cysteine residue. <b>Peracids</b> are highly oxidizing compounds, and thus may induce inactivation of PTPs. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the inhibitory effect of <b>peracids</b> with different length of hydrocarbon chain on the activity of selected PTPs. Methods: The enzymatic activity of human CD 45, PTP 1 B, LAR, bacterial YopH was assayed under the cell-free conditions, and activity of cellular CD 45 in human Jurkat cell lysates. The molecular docking and molecular dynamics were performed to evaluate the <b>peracids</b> binding to the CD 45 active site. Results: Here we demonstrate that <b>peracids</b> reduce enzymatic activity of recombinant CD 45, PTP 1 B, LAR, YopH and cellular CD 45. Our studies indicate that <b>peracids</b> are more potent inhibitors of CD 45 than hydrogen peroxide (with an IC 50 value equal to 25 nM for peroctanoic acid and 8 µM for hydrogen peroxide). The experimental data show that the inactivation caused by <b>peracids</b> is dependent on hydrocarbon chain length of <b>peracids</b> with maximum inhibitory effect of medium-chain <b>peracids</b> (C 8 -C 12 acyl chain), which correlates with calculated binding affinities to the CD 45 active site. Conclusion: <b>Peracids</b> are potent inhibitors of PTPs with the strongest inhibitory effect observed for medium-chain <b>peracids...</b>|$|R

Those <b>peracids</b> were formed in situ, by the Candida antarctica lipase-B-assisted perhydrolysis of carboxylic acids ranging from C 2 to C 18, in hydrogen peroxide solution. The addition of <b>peracids</b> with 4 - 8 carbons in their alkyl chains {{led to the}} formation of two regioisomers, with the prevalence of hydroxyesters bearing a primary free hydroxyl (4 c- 4 e). This prevalence became more pronounced when <b>peracids</b> with longer alkyl chains (C 10 -C 18) were used. In this case, only isomers 4 f- 4 h were formed.

40|$|Because {{of great}} {{environmental}} pressures, the cellulose industry {{has studied the}} potential of use of new bleaching agents among which peroxymonosulfuric acid and peracetic acid stand out. This survey summarizes the results of various laboratory investigations using <b>peracids</b> to delignify eucalyptus kraft pulps. The effect of a step using peroxymonosulfuric acid followed by a D-Eo-D sequence [free of elemental chlorine] was studied and compared {{with the use of}} peracetic acid and mixtures of these two acids. It was shown that a mixture of peroxymonosulfuric acid and peracetic acid reduced more lignin (measured as kappa index) than the individual <b>peracids,</b> and reduced more hexenuronic acid than peracetic acid with less degradation of the cellulose than with peroxymonosulfuric acid.
