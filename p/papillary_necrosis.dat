25|$|The {{specific}} kidney injuries {{induced by}} analgesics are renal <b>papillary</b> <b>necrosis</b> and chronic interstitial nephritis. They appear {{to result from}} decreased {{blood flow to the}} kidney, rapid consumption of antioxidants, and subsequent oxidative damage to the kidney.

This condition was dubbed analgesic nephropathy and was attributed to phenacetin, although no absolute causative role was demonstrated. With further reports of the increased risk of kidney injury with prolonged and excessive phenacetin use, however, phenacetin was banned in several countries between the 1960s and 1980s.|$|E
50|$|Definitive {{diagnosis}} of TEN often requires biopsy confirmation. Histologically, early TEN shows scattered necrotic keratinocytes.

40|$|Catastrophic antiphospholipid {{syndrome}} (CAPS) {{is a rare}} autoimmune condition, {{which has}} been associated with a high mortality rate. However, with current management that includes a combination of anticoagulation, glucocorticoid administration, and plasma exchange, mortality rate has declined. Despite survival improvement with new generation immunosuppressive agents, their mechanisms of action are poorly defined, and CAPS is still considered a high-risk complication in patients known with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Herein, we present a case of a 79 -year-old male who presented with a myocardial infarct and renal failure secondary to CAPS following a splenectomy for immune thrombocytopenia. Regardless of rapid combination of first-line treatment and rituximab therapy, the patient developed lethal cardiogenic shock secondary to mitral valve <b>papillary</b> muscle <b>necrosis.</b> Discussion of the pathophysiology and avenues of future therapies in CAPS are reported...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 209 {{consecutive}} neonate and infant autopsies were reviewed with {{special attention to}} <b>papillary</b> muscle <b>necrosis</b> (PMN) of the heart. Associated major pathological findings were analysed {{for the evaluation of}} significant pathological accompaniments of PMN. PMN was found in 52 cases among 171 (30. 4 %) neonates and major pathological accompaniments were bronchopneumonia, hyaline membrane disease, hypoxic neuronal change, sepsis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and acute tubular necrosis, among which hypoxic neuronal change and ATN had a statistically significant higher incidence when compared with the control group. (p < 0. 005). PMN was found in 13 cases among 38 (34. 2 %) infants and accompaniments were congenital heart disease, sepsis, bronchopneumonia, DIC and hypoxic neuronal change, all of which showed no difference from the control group in incidence. The results imply that PMN is a kind of organ damage in stressed subjects regardless of age, {{that it is not a}} special form of myocardial injury in any specific age group including the newborn period, and is possibly of different pathogenesis and significance...|$|R
25|$|Aspirin {{and other}} NSAIDs are inhibitors of the cyclooxygenases. In the kidney, this {{inhibition}} results in decreased PGE2 concentration causing {{a reduction in}} blood flow. Because {{blood flow to the}} kidney first reaches the renal cortex (outside) and then the renal medulla (inside), the deeper structures of the kidney are most sensitive to decreased blood flow. Thus the innermost structures of the kidney, known as the renal papillae, are especially dependent on prostaglandin synthesis to maintain adequate blood flow. Inhibition of cyclooxygenases therefore rather selectively damages the renal papillae, increasing the risk of renal <b>papillary</b> <b>necrosis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Beethoven's kidneys had {{calcareous}} growths in them, {{indicating that}} he was likely developing renal <b>papillary</b> <b>necrosis</b> (RPN), a common result of analgesic abuse (it is known that he used large amounts of various drugs obtained from his brother Johann, a pharmacist). Diabetes is also a cause of RPN, and scholars have not ruled {{out the possibility that}} the composer had diabetes mellitus. His spleen was swollen to twice the normal size and he had portal hypertension, all consistent with end-stage liver failure. He also appears to have had severe pancreatitis, as the doctors described his pancreas as [...] "shrunken and fibrous", with the exit duct being very thin and narrowed. Large amounts of reddish fluid had accumulated in Beethoven's abdomen, likely from spontaneous bacterial infections mixed with some blood. This was possibly a result of draining fluid from his abdomen in his last days, a practice that frequently caused infection and often death of the patient in a time before antibiotics and bacterial pathology were known.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} cause, almost any {{condition}} that involves ischemia {{can lead to}} renal <b>papillary</b> <b>necrosis.</b> A mnemonic for the causes of renal <b>papillary</b> <b>necrosis</b> is POSTCARDS: pyelonephritis, obstruction of the urogenital tract, sickle cell disease, tuberculosis, cirrhosis of the liver, analgesia/alcohol abuse, renal vein thrombosis, diabetes mellitus, and systemic vasculitis.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of normal human skin with low-fluence CO 2 laser irradiation was studied using a three-phase approach. In phase one, freshly excised skin was observed immediately after impact. In phase two, skin irradiated 2 h prior to excision was studied. In phase three, human volunteers were irradiated and biopsied at time zero, 24 h and 48 h. Seventy-five sites were exposed and 60 biopsies were performed. The earliest histologic changes {{were observed in}} the 6 – 10 J/cm 2 fluence (radiant exposure) range and these changes included spindle and vacuolar changes in the basal layer of the epidermis. Papillary dermal coagulation was present {{to a maximum of}} 0. 03 mm. At fluences of 10 – 25 J/cm 2, superficial dermal necrosis (0. 06 – 0. 08 mm) was observed. At fluences above 25 J/cm 2, transepidermal necrosis was present with increasing <b>papillary</b> dermal <b>necrosis</b> that was in proportion to the energy density delivered. At 2 h, basal vacuolar changes were accompanied by diffuse keratinocytic cell death where contact was maintained between the epidermis and dermis, while where separation occurred limited keratinocytic death was observed. The earliest changes occurred at lower threshold fluences (4 – 6 J/cm 2). After 24 h, these doses resulted in extensive epidermal necrosis with focal acute inflammatory infiltrates. At 48 h, the degree of epidermal “slough” was proportional to the energy density delivered and was maximal with a fluence of 5. 7 J/cm 2 delivered whereas with a fluence of 3. 8 J/cm 2 thin slough (0. 02 mm) was observed. These findings suggest that low-dose CO 2 laser irradiation may provide a new approach to selectively damage the epidermis with minimal dermal damage...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Brucellosis is {{a common}} {{zoonosis}} in Iran, transmitted to humans by direct contact with infected animal materials like fleece, animal excrement, leather, butchery or by the consumption of contaminated animal products (e. g. fresh cheese, unpasteurized milk or dairy products, and raw meat and raw liver that is consumed semi-roasted by kebab sellers in Iran. Case Presentation: A 21 -year-old woman presented with respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema from severe acute mitral valve regurgitation {{in the setting of}} acute Brucella endocarditis. She was found to have a ruptured anterolateral <b>papillary</b> muscle from <b>necrosis</b> caused by corroding large vegetations on the anterior mitral valve leaflet. Conclusions: This occurrence is an exceptionally rare phenomenon, in Brucella mitral endocarditis. Urgent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed large mobile vegetation on the anterior papillary muscle with severe mitral valve regurgitation. The patient underwent mitral valve replacement. During valve replacement surgery, anterior mitral valve vegetation and rupture of the AL-PM were confirmed. We also considered that prolonged post-operative antibiotic treatment was indicated in our patient to protect the newly implanted prosthetic valves...|$|R
40|$|Although {{germline}} mutations of met proto-oncogene {{on human}} chromosome 7 q 31 - 34 {{have been known}} as useful molecular markers of hereditary papillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the expression of MET, a product of met proto-oncogene, has not been fully studied in sporadic RCC, along with its clinical significance. We investigated the expression of MET by immunohistochemistry in 182 cases of renal neoplasm encompassing 145 RCC, 25 urothelial carcinomas of renal pelvis, and 12 oncocytomas. MET was diffusely and strongly expressed in 90 % of papillary RCC, all collecting duct carcinomas, and 92 % of urothelial carcinomas of renal pelvis. On the contrary, clear cell RCC, chromophobe RCC, and oncocytomas were negative or focally positive for MET expression. In clear cell RCC, MET expression {{was positively correlated with}} high nuclear grade, presence of infiltrative growth, tumoral <b>necrosis,</b> <b>papillary</b> architecture, sarcomatoid component, tumoral involvement of the renal pelvis or ureter, involvement of the calyx, and lymphatic invasion. In conclusion, diffuse and strong expression of MET in papillary RCC and collecting duct carcinoma might be helpful in discriminating from the other subtypes of RCC with tubular or papillary growth. In case of MET expression observed in clear cell RCC, it might correlate with those clinicopathological parameters implying aggressive behavior...|$|R

40|$|Definition of asphyxia. Asphyxia is a Greek {{term and}} means loss of pulse (1). There {{is no clear}} {{definition}} of the term, though perinatal asphyxia or birth asphyxia often is defined as impaired placental- or pulmonary oxygen delivery to the neonate. As a consequence the neonate {{is going through a}} period of hypoxaemia and hypercapnia with a subsequent respiratory and metabolic acidosis (1). In clinical work, the diagnosis of perinatal asphyxia predominantly is based on its consequences, and there is a general agreement that a combination of perinatal stress (i. e. fetal bradycardia, acidosis, low Apgar scores), multiple organ affection and neurological symptoms (i. e. hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy) are required for the diagnosis (2). Cardiac abnormalities in perinatal asphyxia. Myocardial performance may vary subsequent to asphyxia. The cardiac dysfunction is often underdiagnosed and requires a high index of suspicion to detect (3; 4). The clinical picture varies from brady- or tachycardia to cardiogenic shock (1; 5). Myocardial failure subsequent to asphyxia was first reported in 1961 (6). The authors described a group of asphyxiated neonates with left ventricular (LV) heart failure within the first 24 hours of life. A decade later three term infants were reported with a syndrome of acute LV failure accompanied by cyanosis and pulmonary and systemic venous congestion (7). Rowe et al. (8) classified the cardiac abnormalities following asphyxia in 1978, broadly as: 1) Transient myocardial ischaemia of the newborn 2) Transient mitral regurgitation of the newborn 3) Transient tricuspid regurgitation of the newborn 4) Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn Increased pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and tricuspid regurgitation is the most common, and although the cardiac abnormalities were described as separate clinical entities, {{it is important to understand}} that the distinction may not be clear, and there is much overlap in the pathogenesis. In severely asphyxiated neonates post-mortem autopsies have showed ischemic <b>papillary</b> muscle <b>necrosis</b> and diffuse subendocardial left ventricular (LV) necrosis secondary to perinatal asphyxia (9; 10). Aetiology The aetiology of asphyxia in the newborn is multifactorial, including abruption or infarction of the placenta, excessive uterine contraction, fetal or maternal bleeding, and compression of the umbilical cord. Infection is contributing to its severity, and the clinical picture in severe asphyxia may present similar to what is seen in severe congenital heart disease, thus it is mandatory to evaluate these neonates by echocardiography to exclude congenital heart disease...|$|R

This is especially pronounced in young, ill, or stressed horses which are less able to metabolize the drug.

50|$|The {{recommended}} dosing has a {{low risk}} profile when taken occasionally in a well hydrated state. As with all medications containing paracetamol (acetaminophen), concomitant use with alcohol carries a significant risk of hepatotoxicity. The combination of paracetamol with aspirin also creates the risk of renal <b>papillary</b> <b>necrosis</b> if large doses are taken chronically. This is because paracetamol yields a toxic metabolite that can accumulate in the kidney while aspirin works to deplete the glutathione stores necessary to oxidize it. Additionally, chronic aspirin usage is associated with increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.|$|E

This is seen most commonly when NSAIDs are used long-term, if they are used at a dose that is higher than recommended, or if two different NSAIDs are used in combination (a method known as “stacking”). Stacking has been shown to have no benefit in reducing pain and a much greater chance of producing toxicity. Some NSAIDs can decrease proteoglycan synthesis, especially in cases of cartilage that is already diseased, which can worsen joint disease.
