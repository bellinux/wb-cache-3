25|$|In animal {{models of}} cardiac disease, {{functions}} of beta-catenin have been unveiled. In a guinea pig model of aortic stenosis and left ventricular hypertrophy, beta-catenin {{was shown to}} change subcellular localization from intercalated discs to the cytosol, despite {{no change in the}} overall cellular abundance of beta-catenin. vinculin showed a similar profile of change. N-cadherin showed no change, and there was no compensatory upregulation of plakoglobin at intercalated discs in the absence of beta-catenin. In a hamster model of cardiomyopathy and heart failure, cell-cell adhesions were irregular and disorganized, and expression levels of adherens junction/intercalated disc and nuclear pools of beta-catenin were decreased. These data suggest that a loss of beta-catenin {{may play a role in}} the diseased intercalated discs that have been associated with cardiac muscle hypertrophy and heart failure. In a rat model of myocardial infarction, adenoviral gene transfer of nonphosphorylatable, constitutively-active beta-catenin decreased MI size, activated the cell cycle, and reduced the amount of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes and cardiac myofibroblasts. This finding was coordinate with enhanced expression of pro-survival proteins, survivin and Bcl-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor while promoting the differentiation of cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. These findings suggest that beta-catenin can promote the regeneration and healing process following myocardial infarction. In a spontaneously-hypertensive heart failure rat model, investigators detected a shuttling of beta-catenin from the intercalated disc/sarcolemma to the nucleus, evidenced by a reduction of beta-catenin expression in the membrane <b>protein</b> <b>fraction</b> and an increase in the nuclear fraction. Additionally, they found a weakening in the association between glycogen synthase kinase-3β and beta-catenin, which may indicate altered protein stability. Overall, results suggest that an enhanced nuclear localization of beta-catenin may be important in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy.|$|E

50|$|Enzymatic {{hydrolysis}} {{similar to}} the body's natural digestive process provides the most efficient breakdown of the proteins into smaller fractions termed peptides which can then {{be separated from the}} oil and non-digested proteins during liquid phase processing. Subsequent steps of solids and oil removal through various mechanical separation techniques are required to create a final fish <b>protein</b> <b>fraction</b> with acceptable organoleptic properties for use in human food. Minimization of odor through the elimination of fat and oil from the <b>protein</b> <b>fraction,</b> as well as separating out the lowest molecular weight protein fractions from the larger fractions all serve to create a refined fish protein. Some processes utilize solvents to extract the fat but these can result in dangerous handling and potential residual issues. The final step in producing the product is typically spray drying, which involves atomizing the liquid protein in a hot air chamber resulting in rapid evaporation of the water and a fine powder falling {{to the bottom of the}} chamber for removal. Spray drying is different from typical oven dehydration used in animal grade fish meal production in that spray drying will not denature the <b>protein</b> <b>fraction</b> resulting in a higher quality protein product for human consumption.|$|E

Albumin and glutelin- 1 fractions were the predominant proteins in the two Nigella species studied in terms of protein content and percent protein yield. Free phenolics were extracted from the isolated <b>protein</b> <b>fractions</b> by methanol treatment at either 25 C or 60 C followed by acid and base hydrolysis to obtain bound phenolics. The free and bound phenolic composition was assessed by RP-HPLC. The highest phenolic content was observed in the free phenolic extract at 25 C (FP- 25 C) in glutelin- 2 of both Nigella species. The free and bound phenolics of the <b>protein</b> <b>fractions</b> were tested for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidant activities. The greatest ACE inhibitory activities were seen for the free and bound phenolic extracts obtained from glutelin- 2 and globulin fractions of both Nigella species. The highest antioxidant activities were observed in the extracted phenolics from glutelin- 1 and globulin from N. damascena and albumin from N. arvensis. Only a weak correlation was seen between the phenolic content of the isolated <b>protein</b> <b>fractions</b> and the ACE inhibitory and antioxidant activities. The present study indicates that phenolic eprotein complexes in the Nigella species have significant antioxidant and ACE inhibitory properties although the bioactivities of the <b>protein</b> <b>fractions</b> are not closely related to their total phenolic content...|$|R

40|$|N THE PRECEDING PAPER (1), it was {{observed}} that the ratio of sulfur to protein in human serum varied widely in health and disease. This was shown to be {{due to the fact that}} the various <b>protein</b> <b>fractions</b> of serum contained different amounts of sulfur. The total sulfur value of serum depended, therefore, upon the relative amounts of these various <b>protein</b> <b>fractions</b> present in human serum. In order to evaluate the significance of the variation in sulfur con-tent found in abnormal serum protein components, it was first neces-sary to establish a set of normal values for the distribution of sulfur in the <b>protein</b> <b>fractions</b> of serum obtained from the healthy adult. To achieve this end, paper electrophoresis was performed on sera obtained from 16 healthy adults.

Only warm season grasses were used in Exp. 2. Leaves were harvested from greenhouse-grown plants, placed in polyester bags, and incubated up to 48 h in situ in three ruminally fistulated steers fed diets of warm season grass hay. The rate of protein disappearance for switchgrass (. 037 h-l) was slower (P 3 ̆c. lo) than that for big bluestem (. 110 h-l). Big bluestem and smooth bromegrass (. l 69 h-l) disappeared at similar rates, whereas switchgrass disappeared more slowly (P 3 ̆c. 05) than smooth bromegrass in Exp. 1.
