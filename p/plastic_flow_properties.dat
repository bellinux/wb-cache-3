The <b>plastic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>property</b> of solid solution single crystals {{was found to}} be clearly different among a three-temperature range (low, intermediate and high temperature ranges) whose boundaries were dependent on the strain rate. From the observed property, we conclude that the deformation in the low temperature range is controlled by the Peierls mechanism, in the intermediate temperature range by the dynamic strain aging and in the high temperature range by the solute atmosphere dragging mechanism. The work softening tends to become less evident with an increasing experimental temperature and with a decreasing strain rate. The temperature and strain rate dependence of the critical resolved shear stress is the strongest in the high temperature range.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, many {{computational}} studies have explored {{the mechanics of}} instrumented normal indentation. In contrast, very few studies have investigated quantitative aspects of frictional sliding contact in the elasto-plastic regime. In this thesis, a new framework was developed to establish relationships between the frictional sliding response, material properties and contact parameters. Dimensional analysis enabled to define scaling variables and dimensionless functions. Finite element methods were used to simulate the process of steady-state frictional sliding and evaluate the dimensionless functions. In frictional sliding, the representative plastic strain {{was found to be}} more than four times as large as in normal indentation. Further comparison with indentation indicated a three fold increase in the maximum pile-up height and an increased influence of the strain hardening on hardness. Experimental studies were conducted with and without a liquid lubricant in selected material systems. Quantitative agreements with numerical predictions were observed in all cases. The strong influence of the strain hardening exponent on the pile-up height was illustrated from frictional sliding results obtained in copper and copper-zinc specimens of different grain sizes. (cont.) Also, the influence of hardening characteristics was illustrated by preparing two microstructures of an aluminum alloy to have the same indentation hardness. These materials with same indentation hardness showed significantly different hardness and pile-up in frictional sliding. Experiments were also carried out on nanocrystalline nickel and alloys of different grain sizes. The addition of tungsten did not change significantly the strain hardening behavior of nanocrystalline nickel but it did stabilize significantly the microstructure in repeated pass experiments. A reverse algorithm was developed to extract <b>plastic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>properties</b> from the frictional sliding response. This algorithm uses the scratch hardness and pile-up measurements to estimate yield strength and strain hardening exponent. Based on sensitivity analysis, the accuracy on these estimates is significantly improved as compared to reverse algorithms for instrumented indentation, especially for the strain hardening exponent.

40|$|International audienceModel dual-phase microstructures were {{developed}} to decouple the effect of martensite volume fraction and martensite hardness on the plastic behavior of dual-phase steels. The martensite volume fraction ranges from 11 % to 37 %, involving two levels of martensite hardness. The yield strength and tensile strength increase with increasing martensite volume fraction, while the uniform elongation decreases. The martensite hardness has a weak impact on the initial yield strength, but it significantly affects the flow behavior for sufficiently large martensite volume fraction. Increasing the hardness of the martensite leads to higher tensile strength combined with only a limited impact on uniform elongation, resulting in an improved strength/ductility balance. The experimental results are successfully captured using finite element based micromechanical analysis. Among others, periodic cell calculations show very good predictive capabilities of the overall plastic response when the stage-IV hardening of the ferrite is taken into account.

Especially in steels, the temperature transition {{is accompanied by}} a strong increase of the measured fracture toughness over a certain temperature range and strong scatter in the toughness data in this transition regime. The change in fracture modes is affected by dynamic interactions between dislocations and the inhomogeneous stress fields of notches and small cracks. In the present work a dislocation dynamics model for the ductile-brittle-transition is proposed, which takes those interactions into account. The model can explain an increase with temperature of apparent toughness in the quasi-brittle regime and different levels of scatter in the different temperature regimes.

The dual-phase metal under consideration is composed {{of a network of}} Inconel- 601 fibres infiltrated by pure aluminium. Hence, both phases exhibit elastic-plastic behaviour and are continuous in the three dimensions of space. The fibre network presents a large morphological anisotropy that is reflected in the mechanical response of the composite. The modelling is based on Eshelby's equivalent inclusion theory. Strain partitioning between the phases is computed incrementally based on tangent operators derived from the isotropic response of individual phases. Assessment of the model relies on extensive experimental data. Uniaxial tensile tests, involving measurement of the Lankford coefficient, have been performed at various temperatures on samples containing different volume fractions of fibres. Measurement of the phase stresses by neutron diffraction supplements the information provided by the macroscopic stress-strain curves. It is demonstrated that predictions are valid only when the micro-macro averaging scheme accounts for the co-continuous character of the constitutive phases. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a systematic {{experimental study of}} the relative contributions of the martensite volume fraction, morphology and carbon content to the overall strength and ductility of dual-phase steels. To this end, model dual-phase steels combining three volume fractions of martensite, three martensitic carbon contents, and three arrangements of the phases were generated by suitable control of the heat treatments. The microstructures include long and short elongated, as well as equiaxed martensitic islands. The yield and tensile strengths increase with both the amount of martensite and its carbon content. The ductility in general increases with the volume fraction of martensite at constant martensitic carbon content, and conversely increases with the martensitic carbon content for a fixed volume fraction of martensite. Departure from the general trend is observed for combinations of a large volume fraction of martensite with a large martensitic carbon content, and is attributed to damage-induced softening or fracture.
