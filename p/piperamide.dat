40|$|This thesis {{examined}} the {{supercritical carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) extraction (SFE) of targeted secondary metabolites from selected natural products. Phytochemical characterization and determination of biological efficacy was completed using advanced analytical methods and in-vivo bio-assays. More than 500 SFE extracts were generated and characterized. Sample preparation (particle size, moisture content) and extraction parameters (pressure, temperature and flow rate) were investigated {{and the ability of}} SFE to extract specific biosynthetic classes of compounds was evaluated. Where warranted, pilot scale studies were conducted for larger scale biological trials. SFE of the neotropical vine, Souroubea sympetala, a traditional medicine used for a culture bound syndrome related to anxiety, resulted in an extract rich in betulinic acid (5. 54 +/- 0. 24 mg/g) determined by HPLC-APCI/MS. When subjected to validated rodent anxiety behavioral assays (e. g. elevated plus maze (EPM)) the SFE extract demonstrated significant anxiolysis (anti-anxiety) compared to the vehicle control, with a 50 % increase in time spent in open arms and a 73 % increase in unprotected head dips observed. The significant in-vivo anxiolysis observed provides scientific support for the ethnobotanical use of this traditional medicine and a promising lead for a natural health product (NHP) to treat anxiety. Systematic variation of SFE parameters (pressure and temperature) on pyrethrum (Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium) oleoresin, a natural insecticide, resulted in a residue free pyrethrin concentrate, suitable for organic agricultural applications. The highest pyrethrin concentration (0. 531 g/g) and highest ratio of pyrethrins I (pyrethrin I, cinerin I, jasmolin I) to pyrethrins II (pyrethrin II, cinerin II, jasmolin I) (PI:PII = 1. 95) was obtained at 40 °C; 10 MPa while 40 °C; 30 MPa produced the lowest pyrethrin concentration (0. 436 g/g) and lowest ratio of PI:PII (1. 87). Total pyrethrin recovery was highest at 40 °C; 30 MPa (8. 39 g pyrethrins) vs. 40 °C; 10 MPa (6. 96 g pyrethrins). The insecticidal activity of the SFE extracts of the pyrethrum oleoresin was confirmed (> 70 % mortality at 48 h) using the Colorado potato beetle (CPB) a major pest of agriculture. SFE of piperamides from black pepper (Piper nigrum), a promising botanical insecticide and synergist, was successful at pressures above 30 MPa and temperatures greater than 50 ˙C with total yields greater than 7. 87 % (CV < 0. 10) and <b>piperamide</b> concentrations greater than 150 mg/g (CV < 6. 0). Flow rate, sample size, and particle size were optimized at 5 L/min, 10 g, and 1 mm mesh respectively. Insecticidal activity corroborated dose dependent <b>piperamide</b> bioactivity. Extract from 10 MPa; 60 °C (42. 38 mg/g) produced 10. 0 +/- 6. 8 (24 h) and 13. 3 +/- 6. 7 % (48 h) mortality. Extract from 35 MPa; 40 °C (148. 56 mg/g) produced 70. 0 +/- 10. 0 (24 h) and 73. 3 +/- 8. 4 % (48 h) mortality. Northern shrimp (Pandelus borealis) by-products extracted by SFE (35 MPa; 40 °C) generated a deep red oil rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), specifically eicosapentaenoic acid EPA (7. 8 +/- 0. 06 %) and docosahexaenoic acid DHA (8. 0 +/- 0. 07 %). Optimization of pressure (60 MPa), temperature (80 °C), moisture (13 %), particle size (0. 85 mm), and flow rate (9 L/min) resulted in a more efficient extraction without significantly changing concentrations of EPA and DHA. Pilot scale studies confirmed experimental data and supports further investigation of commercial production of an omega - 3 (o- 3) concentrate from Northern shrimp by-products...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} <b>piperamides</b> (PA) 8 a-j were designed, {{synthesized}} and evaluated for their antimicrobial and anticonvulsant activity.

40|$|We {{describe}} herein {{an evaluation}} of the trypanocidal effect of eight <b>piperamides</b> (1 - 8) isolated from Piper tuberculatum bearing dihydropyridone, piperidine, and isobutyl moieties against epimastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas` disease. Based on such results, three hydrogenated and two hydrolyzed derivatives (10 - 14) were prepared and evaluated as well. The dihydropyridone amides (1 - 3) displayed higher anti-trypanosomal activity. The (Z) -piplartine (1) showed higher activity with a 50 % inhibition concentration (IC(50)) value of 10. 5 mu M, almost four times more potent than the positive control, benznidazole (IC(50) = 42. 7 mu M), and should be further evaluated as a suitable hit for the design of new antiprotozoal agents.

40|$|The EtOH {{extracts}} of {{the leaves}} of Margraviaceae, a relatively rare Central American vine for which ethnobotanical reports suggested possible anti-anxiety properties, showed significant anti-anxiety activity in animal models for anxiety. Subsequent bioassay-guided fractionation of these extracts yielded an EtOAc active fraction (f 1). Further bioassay-directed chromatography of (f 1), led to the isolation of betulinic acid (3) as the bioactive constituent in 0. 01 % of dry weight. Six known pentacyclic triterpenoids [(1 a), (1 b), (2 a), (2 b), (4), (5 a) ], six known flavonoids [(6), (7), (8 a), (8 b), (9), (10) ], chondrillasterol (11), linolenic acid (12) and a porphyrin type compound (13) were also isolated. When (3) was administered at 0. 5 mg per kg (possibly less) {{in a variety of}} rat and mouse model assays, the activity of (3) was comparable to that of Valium, the most famous member of the benzodiazepines family. Synthetic derivatives of (3) were prepared and evaluated for anti-anxiety activity. Several of the simple esters appear to have ideal properties as new drug Candidates. In particular, betulinic acid methyl ester or methyl betulinate (3 a) exhibited anti-anxiety activity superior to (3). The activity profile of (3 a) is such that (3 a) can be considered a viable drug candidate. An excellent relay synthesis of (3) from another closely related natural product betulin (14), that is abundantly available in Eastern Ontario, was developed. Radioactive 3 H-labelled betulinic acid methyl ester (3 a″) was also prepared in order to facilitate identification of relevant anti-anxiety receptors and the mechanism of action of the compound. This is important since (3) showed no significant binding to any of the 40 anti-anxiety receptors currently implicated in anxiety. Therefore, it appears to act as an anti-anxiety agent via a new mode of action. * In a second project, the active components of a member of the Piperaceae or Pepper family (P. tuberculatum) from Costa Rica, were isolated and their structures characterized as 5, 6 -dihydropiperlonguminine (25), 5, 6 -dihydropiperine (26), piperine (27) and piperlonguminine (28). Extracts from this neotropical plant had been previously demonstrated by our biology collaborators, Professor Arnason's group, to be strongly insecticidal towards a variety of pests including mosquitoes, earwigs and white grubs. Moreover, the P. tuberculatum extracts were as effective as the well-documented Asian (P. nigrum) and African (P. guineense) Piper species. <b>Piperamides</b> (25) [...] (28) were synthesized in sufficient amounts to allow extensive evaluation of their insecticidal properties. Experiments with these <b>piperamides</b> showed that the tertiary and quaternary mixtures have greater-than-additive toxicity compared to single compounds or binary mixtures. That is, these <b>piperamides</b> synergize each other. Compound (25) was the most acutely toxic in mosquito larvae bioassays. The field trials to date indicate a high potential for the development of an effective, relatively inexpensive botanically based insecticide. Radioactive 3 H-labelled piperine (27 ″) was also synthesized for toxicokinetic studies. *Please refer to dissertation for diagrams...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{highlights}} the practical {{application of a}} Piper-based botanical insecticide for controlling insect pests {{of the home and}} garden in urban areas in eastern Canada and northeastern North America. Biopesticides, including botanicals, can offer a safe and effective alternative to conventional insecticides for controlling major insect pests within an IPM program. Secondary compounds from the Piperaceae family, specifically the abundant isobutyl amides and lignans, have shown promise for insecticidal applications. A method for extraction and HPLC-MS analysis of Piper spp. was developed in order to allow quick and accurate measure of <b>piperamide</b> levels in P. nigrum, P. tuberculatum, West African Guinea pepper, P. guineense Schum and Thonn, and in less recognized species from Central America. Extraction of leaf and peppercorn material with 50 : 50 ethyl acetate and water provided a greater than 80 % recovery of spiked piperine. HPLC analysis using a binary gradient of acetonitrile and water provided a clean separation of the major amide peaks between 5 and 12 min. The use of APCI-MS improved the detection limit 10 fold below the 2 -ng limit of the HPLC-DAD method. Extracts from P. nigrum, P. guineense and P. tuberculatum were tested for efficacy against insects from five orders. Among the insect pests tested, the most sensitive species were, in order of increasing lethal concentration: Eastern tent caterpillar, Malacosoma americanum F. < European pine sawfly larvae, Neodiprion sertifer Geoffroy < spindle ermine moth larvae, Yponomeuta cagnagella Hubner < Viburnum leaf beetle larvae, Pyrrhalta viburni Paykull < stripped cucumber beetle adult, Acalymma vittatum Fabrcius < Colorado potato beetle adult, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) < Japanese beetle adult, Popillia japonica Newman < hairy chinch bug, Blissus leucopterus hirtus Montandon. Greenhouse trials revealed that the pepper formulations also had a repellent activity thus protecting plant leaves from: (1) herbivory by lily leaf beetles, Lilioceris lilii (Scopoli) adults and larvae, and striped cucumber beetle, Acalymma vittatum F. adults and (2) oviposition by European corn borer, Ostrina nubilalis (Hubner). When an insecticide resistant strain of potato beetle larvae was tested with the P. tuberculatum extract, there was less than a two fold tolerance ratio compared to the 22 -fold tolerance ratio to cypermethrin, a pyrethroid. An in vitro polysubstrate monoxygenase (PSMO) enzyme assay, using the substrate methoxyresorufin O-demethylation (MROD), determined that piperine, is responsible for inhibition of that specific enzyme. A subsequent toxicokinetic study determined that piperine is quickly eliminated from the exoskeleton (t 1 / 2 = 16. 5 h) and hemolymph (t 1 / 2 = 12 h) of the adult American cockroach Periplaneta americana L. after a topical application.

40|$|Gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors are {{the major}} {{inhibitory}} neurotransmitter receptors in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). These heteropentameric transmembrane proteins act as chloride ion channel upon activation by the endogenous ligand γ-amino butyric acid (GABA). Until now, 11 distinct GABAA receptor subtypes have been identified in the human brain. They differ in their subunit stoichiometry, tissue localization, functional characteristics, and pharmacological properties. Many CNS depressant drugs, such as the benzodiazepines exert their action via enhancement of the GABAergic neuronal inhibition. However, therapy may be accompanied by unwanted side-effects and specific clinical action is precluded {{due to the lack of}} GABAA receptor subtype selectivity. In a preliminary screen the lipophilic extracts of Piper nigrum fruits, Angelica pubescens roots, Acorus calamus roots, Biota orientalis leaves and twigs, and Kadsura longipedunculata fruits had shown positive GABAA receptor modulating activity in an in vitro functional, automated two-microelectrode voltage clamp assay with Xenopus laevis oocytes, which transiently expressed α 1 β 2 γ 2 S GABAA receptors. Aiming at the discovery of new scaffolds which act at the GABAA receptor, the active constituents of these five plant extracts were identified by means of an HPLC-based activity profiling approach. In total, we discovered 28 secondary metabolites with positive GABAA receptor modulating properties belonging to the structural classes of coumarins, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, phenylpropanes, <b>piperamides,</b> and lignans. Their structures were elucidated by a combination of powerful analytical methods such as HPLC-PDA-TOF-MS, highly sensitive microprobe NMR, and for chiral compounds, polarimetry and ECD. Determination of relative and absolute configuration was supported by conformational analysis and quantum chemical calculations. Furthermore, three yet unknown natural products could be identified. HPLC-based activity profiling with P. nigrum enabled the identification of 13 structurally related <b>piperamides</b> with minimum amount of extract. This allowed us to draw preliminary structure activity considerations for the scaffold of piperine, which was the main α 1 β 2 γ 2 S GABAA receptor modulator in this plant (EC 50 : 52. 4  ±  9. 4  μM, maximal stimulation of GABA induced chloride currents (IGABA) by 302...|$|R
40|$|A {{new group}} of {{alkaloids}} emerged in 1819 following the isolation of piperine from the fruits of Piper nigrum. Since then, {{a large number of}} these compounds now referred to as piperine-type alkaloids or alkamides or <b>piperamides</b> have been isolated commonly from species belonging to the genus piper (piperaceae) which have worldwide geographical distribution. As a result of the traditional uses of piper species as spices in foods and in phytomedicines globally a number of their extractives and indeed the constituent amides have been screened for pharmacological properties. The biogenesis of the amides has been investigated and a number of synthetic pathways have been developed to make them readily available for biological studies. It has now been established that piperine and its analogues are potential pesticides and possess a number of medicinal properties. They are regarded as universal enhancers in pesticide and drug formulations. This review enhances our knowledge of these amides and paves way for further work. </p...|$|R

Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the in vitro antiparasitic effect of plant extracts on Haemonchus contortus in sheep and the in vivo effect on Strongyloides venezuelensis in Rattus norvegicus. The plant extracts from Piper tuberculatum, Lippia sidoides, Mentha piperita, Hura crepitans and Carapa guianensis, produced at different research institutions, were chemically analyzed and evaluated through the egg hatch test (EHT) and larval development test (LDT) in H. contortus.
