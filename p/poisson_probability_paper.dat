40|$|Abstract [...] Three {{methods for}} {{numerical}} transient analysis of Markov chains, the modified Jensen's method (Jensen's method with steady-state detection {{of the underlying}} DTMC and computation of <b>Poisson</b> <b>probabilities</b> using the method of Fox and Glynn [1]), a third-order L-stable implicit Runge-Kutta method, and a second-order L-stable method, TR-BDF 2, are compared. These methods are evaluated {{on the basis of}} their performance (accuracy of the solution and computational cost) on stiff Markov chains. Steady-state detection in Jensen's method results in large savings of computation time for Markov chains when mission time extends beyond the steady-state point. For stiff models, computation of <b>Poisson</b> <b>probabilities</b> using traditional methods runs into underflow problems. Fox and Glynn's method for computing <b>Poisson</b> <b>probabilities</b> avoids underflow problems for all practical problems and yields highly accurate solutions. We conclude that for mildly stiff Markov chains, the modified Jensen's method is the method of choice. For stiff Markov chains, we recommend the use of the L-stable ODE methods. If low accuracy (upto eight decimal places) is acceptable, then TR-BDF 2 method should be used. If higher accuracy is desired, then we recommend third-order implicit Runge-Kutta method. 1...|$|R

40|$|Solar flares {{occur in}} complex sunspot groups, {{but it remains}} unclear how the {{probability}} of pro- ducing a flare of a given magnitude relates to {{the characteristics of the}} sunspot group. Here, we use Geostationary Operational Environment Satellite X-ray flares and McIntosh group classifications from solar cycles 21 and 22 to calculate average flare rates for each McIntosh class and use these to deter- mine <b>Poisson</b> <b>probabilities</b> for different flare magnitudes. Forecast verification measures are studied to find optimum thresholds to convert <b>Poisson</b> flare <b>probabilities</b> into yes/no predictions of cycle 23 flares. A case is presented to adopt the true skill statistic (TSS) as a standard for forecast comparison over the commonly used Heidke skill score (HSS). In predicting flares over 24 hr, the maximum values of TSS achieved are 0. 44 (C-class), 0. 53 (M-class), 0. 74 (X-class), 0. 54 (?M 1. 0), and 0. 46 (?C 1. 0). The maximum values of HSS are 0. 38 (C-class), 0. 27 (M-class), 0. 14 (X-class), 0. 28 (?M 1. 0), and 0. 41 (?C 1. 0).
