In such contexts, sound often functions as a metaphor for mystical revelation, instability, forbidden desires, disorder, formlessness, the unknown, unconscious and extra-human, a representation of immaterial worlds.

40|$|The {{treatment}} {{of drinking water}} is advocated to {{reduce the incidence of}} child diarrhea. However, evaluating the impact of water treatment with only observational data leads to biased estimates since it could be the occurrence of child diarrhea that induced the household to treat their drinking water. To deal with the possible simultaneity between the {{treatment of}} drinking water and the incidence of child diarrhea, we specify non-recursive two-equation causal models and apply it on a sub-sample of households with children below five years old from the Philippine National Demographic and Health Surveys. In the treatment effects model, we find that the treatment of drinking water reduces by 5. 2 percentage points the proportion of under- 5 children afflicted with diarrhea. In the instrumental-variable probit model, we find that households have a higher propensity to sterilize their drinking water by 1. 2 percentage points given a one percentage point increase in the proportion of under- 5 children with diarrhea. Ignoring the simultaneity yields the misleading result that water treatment increases the incidence child diarrhea. These results underscore the need to insure the quality of drinking water at the point of use and not just at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>source...</b>|$|E

However, despite these advantages, the information generated from the mobile phone-based NTD MIS has yet to be used to support decentralised decision-making. Even with improved technology and political will, the biggest hindrance to local usage of information for health planning is the lack of synthesised and analysed health information from the district and national levels to the villages.

We design the fire detection system using four flame sensors in the fire fighting robot, and program the fire detection and fighting procedure using sensor based method. The fire fighting robot is equipped with four thermistors/flame sensors that continuously monitor the temperature. If the temperature increases beyond the predetermined threshold value, buzzer sounds to intimate the occurrence of fire accident and a warning message {{will be sent to}} the respective personnel in the industry and to nearby fire station with the GSM module provided to it. Fire Fighting Robot continuously monitors the temperature at four sensors and if fire accident is true, the robot moves to the direction to which the temperature is recorded to be the relatively maximum among the four sensors and extinguishes the fire with water pump provided to it. After extinguishing the fire it comes back to its initial position. It is more advantageous than a smoke detector as it can extinguish the fire at the inception than waiting for an object to burn and produce smoke.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a new litmus paper test (DipTest) for detecting Escherichia coli (E. coli) in water samples by performing enzymatic reactions directly on the porous paper substrate. The paper strip consists of a long narrow piece of cellulose blotting paper coated with chemoattractant (at bottom edge), wax hydrophobic barrier (at the top edge), and custom formulated chemical reagents (at reaction zone immediately below the wax hydrophobic barrier). When the paper strip is dipped in water, E. coli in the water sample is attracted toward the paper strip due to a chemotaxic mechanism followed by the ascent along the paper strip toward the reaction zone due to a capillary wicking mechanism, and finally the capillary motion is arrested at {{the top edge of}} the paper strip by the hydrophobic barrier. The E. coli concentrated at the reaction zone of the paper strip will react with custom formulated chemical reagents to produce a pinkish-red color. Such a color change on the paper strip when dipped into water samples indicates the presence of E. coli contamination in potable water. The performance of the DipTest device has been checked with different known concentrations of E. coli contaminated water samples using different dip and wait times. The DipTest device has also been tested with different interfering bacteria and chemical contaminants. It has been observed that the different interfering contaminants do not have any impact on the DipTest, and it can become a potential solution for screening water samples for E. coli contamination at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>source...</b>|$|E

It examines the social climate of provincial nobles along with their views on government officials. Studying diaries dated {{by the end of}} the eighteenth century is particularly relevant for history, literature and culture studies. This allows us to understand historical events and the socio-cultural background of the century under analysis more fully. Since diaries and other private materials written by famous politicians and government officials may seem insufficient for more detailed analysis, we need to take into account unpublished and scientifically undescribed materials written by average representatives of Russian society. The article presents description of the diary from the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>source</b> criticism as well as its potential for analyzing daily life of nobles and provincial cities in the end the eighteenth century. Petr Oznobishin’s diary allows us to clarify details of Morteza Qoli Khan Qajar’s biography, the remarkable Persian politician. Despite elaborate preparations for the war against Persia, he managed to invite Russian provincial officials of all ranks to receptions. The examining of Petr Oznobishin’s diary provides valuable information regarding ‘natsionalny vopros’ (nationalist problem) in the Russian Empire as well as cooperation of various ethnicities in the south of the country and the way Russian nobles perceived their activity. With the help of P. N. Oznobishin’s notes, which he took from September to December in 1796, daily life of Russian noble government officers and officials is examined in terms of its peculiar features. ...|$|E

40|$|Heavy metals have {{widespread}} {{industrial uses}} {{and have been}} found in increasing quantities as contaminants in all components of the biosphere. Water and sediment of rivers near industrial areas such as the Juru River in Penang and Langat River in Selangor are polluted with heavy metals. Thus, rapid and fast methods to detect the presence of heavy metals in the environment are necessary. Existing instrumental methods such as atomic absorption and emission spectrometry are very sensitive but the sole use of these instruments for heavy metal detection is extremely expensive, needs a skillful person to operate and is not amenable to near-real-time analysis. The best scenario for routine biomonitoring of heavy metals is the marriage between instrument- and bioassays. Currently, the USEPA has recognized whole cell-based bioassays such as as PolytoxTM and Microtox® for the detection of heavy metals. Unfortunately these cell-based assays cannot be used as real-time or near real-time assays in the field as they require bulky incubators. Near-real-time monitoring of heavy metals giving results in less than one hour is very useful in environmental CSI (Criminal Scene Investigation) or ECSI where temporal and spatial concentrations of heavy metals in running waters are a challenge to environmentalists to pinpoint heavy metals POS (<b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>source)</b> for legal purposes. Enzyme-based inhibitive assays are simple, rapid and fast and could be developed for near real-time assays. We have developed an inhibitive assay system –Xenoassay® based on proteases for the assay of heavy metals.

Filtration dilutes and spreads the inoculum onto a solid culture surface. Experiments were conducted to determine the optimum inoculum size, microbial permeability through filter papers, and ability to exclude vaginal epithelial cells. The filter paper dilution system was compared to the standard streak method to detect bacteriuria in specimens submitted to the diagnostic laboratory. The sensitivity and specificity of the filter paper dilution system for detection of high-count (≥ 104 CFU/ml) gram-negative bacteriuria in 487 urine specimens were 98. 2 and 97. 4 %, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for gram-positive bacteriuria in 404 urine specimens were 91. 2 and 99. 2 %, respectively. Low-count gram-negative bacteriuria (< 104 CFU/ml) was detected by the filter paper dilution system in five of nine specimens (55. 6 %). In addition, the filter paper dilution system was able to detect gram-negative bacteria in 12 of 41 (29. 3 %) mixed cultures. Lactobacillus and Gardnerella organisms in urine specimens were excluded by the filter paper dilution system. Only three of eight Candida sp. isolates were detected at counts of ≥ 104 CFU/ml.

Carbon nanostructures; ranging from vertically aligned multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), graphenated carbon nanotubes (g-­CNTs) to carbon nanosheets (CNS); were synthesized using a MPECVD system. The nanostructures were characterized by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy. In addition to employing commonly used electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), a new technique was developed to evaluate the energy and power density of individual electrodes. This facilitated comparison {{of a variety of}} electrode materials without having to first develop complex device packaging schemes. It was found that smaller pore size and higher density of carbon foliates on a three-dimensional scaffold of carbon nanotubes increased specific capacitance. A design of experiments (DOE) study was conducted to explore the parametric space of the MWCNT system. A range of carbon nanostructures of varying morphology were obtained. It was observed that the capacitance was dependent on defect density. Capacitance increased with defect density. A BDD electrode was characterized for use in a module designed to disinfect human liquid waste {{as a part of a}} new advanced energy neutral, water and additive-free toilet designed for treating waste at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>source.</b> The electrode was utilized in a batch process system that generated mixed oxidants from ions present in simulated urine and inactivated E.

40|$|Much {{research}} has been done on aflatoxins since their discovery in the 1960 ’s where it was concluded that aflatoxins have carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic and immunosuppressive properties. Aflatoxin M 1 exists in milk and since milk is a major component of the diet of infants, the maximum permissible limit set by the EU is 50 parts per trillion (ng L - 1). Current methods of analysis for aflatoxin M 1 is primarily based around techniques such as HPLC and TLC which require extensively trained operators and equipped laboratories. Using antibodies as receptors in an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the analysis costs can be reduced and simplified, however, an equipped laboratory is still required. Hence {{there is a need for}} a low cost, rapid, portable instrument which is easy to use at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>source</b> for the detection of aflatoxin M 1. This thesis describes the development of affinity sensors to meet these requirements. Firstly the design and optimisation of an ELISA method was carried out, utilising a commercially sourced monoclonal antibody. Once the antibodies suitability for sensing aflatoxin M 1 was determined the antibody was successfully employed as the receptor for a screen printed HRP/TMB based immunosensor. Upon the analysis of milk it was observed that milk caused extensive interference and through a series of chemical extractions the interference was attributed to whey proteins in the milk with suspicion towards a- lactalbumin. A simple pre-treatment technique of adding calcium chloride was performed and the interference from the whey proteins was removed. The resulting immunosensor achieved a sensitivity of 39 ng L - 1 (Figure 3. 26), however, poor reproducibility was observed due to the screen printed electrode production (%CV = 21 % variance for screen printed electrode production). Gold cell on a chip microelectrode arrays were used to replace the screen printed electrodes and the successful covalent attachment of the antibody to the microelectrode array through PDITC cross linking compound was monitored using atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. It was shown that the majority of the antibodies during immobilisation orientate in a ‘side on’ orientation and therefore a cheap capture polyclonal antibody was first immobilised before the addition of the sensing anti-aflatoxin M 1 monoclonal antibody. Using the microelectrode array an improvement of the sensitivity as well as a reduction of the milk interference was shown. Sensitivity was improved to 8 ng L - 1 in milk (Figure 4. 23). Further work was performed to substitute the fragile antibody used in the sensing layer for a robust synthetic peptide receptor. Initially a virtual library of synthetic peptides was created using de novo design techniques in silico. Further computational techniques were performed to determine the best peptide from the library. This peptide had a sequence of PVGPRP. From literature a peptide (LLAR) was reported with affinity for aflatoxin B 1. This sequence along with the de novo design peptide was synthesised and tested using a host of techniques and immobilisation chemistries such as optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy (OWLS), BIAcore and enzymatic techniques using EDC/NHS, glutaraldehyde and BS 3 cross linking methods. The affinity of both peptides to aflatoxin M 1 was demonstrated however further work is required to quantify the affinity and to incorporate the peptides into the microelectrode array.

40|$|Ensuring {{access to}} safe {{drinking}} water is a key strategy for reducing waterborne illness. The WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) differentiates between unimproved and improved sources to universally classify water access. This classification, however, {{is based on the}} type and location of the water source and {{does not take into account}} water quality; even sources classified as improved can have compromised water quality and pose a health risk from waterborne illness. One type of improved water source in urban settings is piped drinking water on premises. However, the presence of a piped connection gives little information about the quality, quantity and frequency of water delivery. Even in settings with centralized water treatment, piped water distribution systems are vulnerable to performance deficiencies that can cause (re) contamination of treated water and plausibly lead to increased risk of gastrointestinal illness (GII) in consumers. It is well established that large system disruptions in piped water networks can cause GII outbreaks. We hypothesized that routine network problems can also contribute to background levels of waterborne illness and conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the impact of distribution system deficiencies on endemic GII. We reviewed published studies that compare direct tap water consumption to consumption of tap water re-treated at the point of use (POU) and studies of specific system deficiencies such as breach of physical or hydraulic pipe integrity and lack of disinfectant residual. In settings with network malfunction, consumers of tap versus POU-treated water had increased GII (IDR = 1. 34, 1. 00 - 1. 79). The subset of non-blinded studies showed a marked association between GII and tap versus POU-treated water consumption (IDR = 1. 52, 1. 05 - 2. 20); there was no association in studies that blinded participants to their POU water treatment status (IDR = 0. 98, 0. 90 - 1. 08). Among studies focusing on specific network deficiencies, increased GII was associated with temporary water outages (RR = 3. 26, 1. 48 - 7. 19) as well as chronic outages in intermittently operated distribution systems (OR = 1. 61, 1. 26 - 2. 07). These findings suggest that tap water consumption is associated with GII in malfunctioning distribution networks. System deficiencies such as water outages increase the risk of GII, presenting a potential health risk for consumers served by piped water networks. Additionally, intermittent delivery of piped water is a common form of water supply in low-income countries. Intermittent supply can lead to waterborne illness through contamination of water in pipelines or in household storage, use of unsafe water sources during intermittencies and limited water availability for hygiene. To assess the health impact of intermittent water delivery as a particular type of breach of hydraulic pipe integrity, we conducted a matched cohort study to assess the impact of switching from intermittent to continuous water supply in Hubli-Dharwad, India, on child diarrhea and mortality, and severe waterborne illness in tap water consumers. We used multivariate matching to match continuous supply areas to intermittent supply areas with comparable baseline characteristics in Hubli-Dharwad. We followed 3919 households with children under five over 15 months. In continuous supply areas, we observed 42 % reduction in the percentage of households with at least one case of typhoid fever since the program was implemented (CIR = 0. 58, 0. 41 - 0. 78) and potentially 49 % reduction in the percentage of households with death of a child under the age of two (CIR = 0. 51, 0. 22 - 1. 07). Consistently with these reductions, our findings also suggested reductions in seven-day prevalence of diarrhea (PR = 0. 93, 0. 83 - 1. 04) blood or mucus in stool (PR = 0. 78, 0. 60 - 1. 01) in children under five in continuous supply areas. These reductions were more pronounced in low-income households (diarrhea PR = 0. 89, 0. 76 - 1. 04; blood/mucus PR = 0. 63, 0. 46 - 0. 87). The effect of rainfall on the impact of continuous supply on child waterborne illness was inconclusive. Our findings indicate that switching from intermittent to continuous water supply reduced waterborne illness in Hubli-Dharwad. Another type of improved water source, commonly used in rural settings, is tubewells that draw groundwater from shallow aquifers. Shallow tubewells are the primary drinking water source for the majority of rural Bangladeshis. While groundwater is often considered microbiologically safe, fecal contamination has been detected in tubewell water, typically at low concentrations at the source and at higher levels at the point of use. The magnitude of the waterborne disease burden associated with consumption of tubewell water is not well understood. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess whether improving the microbial quality of tubewell drinking water by household water treatment and safe storage would reduce diarrhea in children < 2 y in rural Bangladesh. We randomly assigned 1800 households into one of three arms: chlorine plus safe storage, safe storage and control. We longitudinally followed households with monthly visits for one year to promote the products and collect health outcomes. Both interventions had high uptake in the study population. Safe storage, alone and in combination with chlorination, reduced heavy contamination of stored water. In the chlorine plus safe storage arm, 2 % of stored water samples had E. coli concentrations exceeding 100 CFU/ 100 mL, compared to 7 % in the safe storage arm and 21 % in the control arm. Compared to controls, diarrhea prevalence in children < 2 y was reduced by 36 % in the chlorine plus safe storage arm (PR = 0. 64, 0. 55 - 0. 73) and 31 % in the safe storage arm (PR = 0. 69, 0. 60 - 0. 80); there was no difference between the two intervention arms (PR = 0. 92, 0. 79 - 1. 08). Our findings suggest that safe storage significantly improved drinking water quality and reduced child diarrhea in rural Bangladesh. There was no added benefit from combining safe storage with chlorination. Taken together, this body of evidence confirms previous findings that, even for water sources categorized as improved by the JMP, there are water quality problems that can pose a public health threat. Our findings highlight deteriorations in water quality associated with deficiencies in the distribution and handling of drinking water from the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>source</b> to the point of consumption, rather than contamination at the water source. These findings suggest that efforts to improve drinking water quality should place emphasis on preventing contamination at each step of the chain leading from the water source to the point of consumption, including the distribution system and household storage containers, to maximize the protection against waterborne illness...|$|E
