These disorders are often undertreated and may affect mothers and children’s health. This study investigates the relation between antenatal maternal depression, anxiety and children’s early cognitive development among 1380 two-year-old children and 1227 three-year-old children. MethodsIn the French EDEN Mother-Child Cohort Study, language ability was assessed with the Communicative Development Inventory at 2 {{years of age and}} overall development with the Ages and Stages Questionnaire at 3 years of age. Multiple regressions and structural equation modeling were used to examine links between depression, anxiety during pregnancy and child cognitive development.

Antenatal maternal depression was not associated with child development, except when antenatal maternal anxiety was also present. Both <b>postnatal</b> maternal <b>depression</b> and parental stimulation appeared to play mediating roles in the relation between antenatal maternal anxiety and children’s cognitive development.

30|$|Current evidence, {{from both}} human and animal studies suggest that {{perinatal}} adversity, stress, and inflammation; genetic and epigenetic changes; and hormonal dysregulation, including changes in hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, play key roles {{in the development of}} perinatal reproductive mood disorders (Gluckman and Hanson 2006; Matthews and Meaney 2005; Meaney 2010; Osborne and Monk 2013; Monk et al. 2012; Meltzer-Brody 2011).

40|$|Early {{postnatal}} discharge {{is itself}} {{not a new}} concept. Its first recorded use was in New Orleans, 1942, when postnatal mothers were discharged soon after birthing to relieve pressure on crowded hospital situations.  Since then, the effects of early postnatal discharge on mothers and babies have been widely studied, but the research has primarily focused on the safety to mothers and babies of going home early. Lock’s study took as its focus the experience of mothers who elected early discharge. The women who participated in that study (a mixed group of first-, second- and third-time mothers), had chosen to take early discharge before they went into hospital. The project tracked their experiences, and provided a reflective evaluation made about six weeks after coming home. Much of the focus in early childhood and community settings is {{on the health of}} the infant. While this is clearly important, the physical, emotional and social needs of the mother must not be overlooked. This paper will briefly describe some of the common physical problems and social stresses experienced {{in the first six months}} after birth.

No published studies, however, have simultaneously: (i) controlled for co-occurring prenatal risks that may influence maternal prenatal anxiety and depression; (ii) compared the relative contributions of prenatal and postnatal maternal anxiety and depression on child functioning; and (iii) assessed a full range of child psychopathology and functioning to determine the relative effects of prenatal and <b>postnatal</b> anxiety and <b>depression</b> in the mother. |Using 3, 298 mother-offspring pairs, the authors examined these factors in a single-path analytic model.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Speech sound {{disorders}} (SSD) are {{the most}} prevalent childhood communication disorders. Many cases of SSD have an unknown origin. The study investigated the effect of prenatal maternal depression on the offspring's speech sound production. METHOD: Data from 26 mother–child dyads {{were included in the}} study. Prenatal maternal depression was assessed by a validated questionnaire during the third trimester of pregnancy. Speech sound production ability was assessed {{in terms of the number}} of atypical (non-developmental) speech errors produced in a standardized speech assessment when the children were 2 -years-old. RESULTS: Six of the mothers’ questionnaires suggested depression, whereas 20 were within normal limits. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that prenatal depression uniquely accounted for 30. 8 % of the variance in speech sound acquisition after controlling for the child's sex and <b>postnatal</b> maternal <b>depression</b> level. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal prenatal depression was significantly associated with more atypical speech errors in the offspring at 2 years.

We estimated potential associations between reports of pre-, peri-, and <b>postnatal</b> stress and <b>depression</b> severity in outpatients (N =  473) diagnosed with depression, anxiety or somatoform disorders by their family physician. We retrospectively assessed pre-, peri-, and postnatal stress and measured depression severity as well as recent life stress using questionnaires. First, we estimated if depression severity was predicted by pre-, peri- and/or postnatal stress using multiple regression models. Second, we compared pre- and postnatal stress levels between patient subgroups of different degrees of depression severity, performing multilevel linear modeling. Third, we analyzed if an association between postnatal stress and current depression severity was mediated by recent life stress. We found no associations of pre-, or perinatal stress with depression severity (all p >  0. 05). Higher postnatal stress was associated with higher depression severity (p <  0. 001). Patients with moderately severe and severe depression reported higher levels of postnatal stress as compared to patients with none to minimal, or mild depression (all p <  0. 05). Mediation analysis revealed a significant indirect effect via recent life stress of the association between <b>postnatal</b> stress and <b>depression</b> severity (p <  0. 001).

40|$|The study {{investigated}} prospectively {{the effect of}} prenatal mental health problems in terms of anxiety and depression on speech sound acquisition in 26 mother-child dyads. Prenatal anxiety and depression were assessed using validated screening tools during late pregnancy.

Multiple regression analyses illustrated that prenatal depression uniquely explained 30. 8 % of the variance in speech sound acquisition after controlling for the child’s sex and <b>postnatal</b> maternal <b>depression</b> level. However, the regression model for the anxiety measures was not significant. In conclusion, clinical level of prenatal depression was significantly associated with more atypical phonological patterns. The current findings contribute to the understanding of the etiology of functional speech sound disorders (SSD). At the clinical level, prenatal depression maybe taken as a risk factor for SSD and the importance of enhancing mental health in pregnant women with depression is empathized.

The MINI-Plus and anxiety and depression measures were re-administered at 7 months postpartum. The Parenting Stress Index was also administered at this time. Significant associations were found between maternal 'affectionless control' and prenatal and postnatal symptom measures of anxiety and depression, p values < 0. 005.

40|$|Background The {{relationship}} of <b>postnatal</b> (postpartum) <b>depression</b> (PND) to episodes of depression occurring {{at other times}} is not well understood. Despite {{a number of studies}} of clinical presentation, there is little consistency in the literature. We have undertaken within- and between-individual comparisons of the clinical presentation of postnatal (PN) and non-postnatal (NPN) depressive episodes in women with recurrent depression. Method In a sample of well-characterized, parous women meeting DSM-IV and ICD- 10 criteria for recurrent major depressive disorder, the clinical presentation of episodes of major depression with onset within 4 weeks of giving birth (PND group, n= 50) were compared with (i) the non-postnatal episodes of women with PND, and (ii) episodes of major depression in parous women who had not experienced episodes of mood disorder in relation to childbirth (NPND group, n= 132). In addition, the non-postnatal episodes of the PND group of women were compared with the depressive episodes of the NPND group. Results The small number of differences found between PN and NPN depressive episodes, such as reduced early morning wakening in postnatal episodes, are likely to be explicable by the context of having a new baby rather than by any difference {{in the nature of the}} underlying depression. Conclusions The results do not point to substantial differences in clinical presentation between episodes of major depression occurring in relation to childbirth and at other times. Other avenues of research are therefore required to demonstrate a specific relationship between childbirth and depression...|$|R
40|$|<b>Postnatal</b> {{maternal}} <b>depression</b> {{is associated}} with poorer child emotional and behavioral functioning, but {{it is unclear whether}} this occurs following brief episodes or only with persistent depression. Little research has examined the relation between postnatal anxiety and child outcomes. The present study examined the role of postnatal major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) symptom chronicity on children’s emotional and behavioral functioning at 24 months. Following postnatal screening mothers (n = 296) were identified as having MDD, GAD, MDD and GAD, or no disorder at 3 months postnatal; the average age was 32. 3 (SD = 5. 0), 91. 9 % self-identified as Caucasian, and 62. 2 % were married. Maternal disorder symptom severity was assessed by questionnaires and structured interview at 3, 6, 10, 14, and 24 months postpartum. At 24 months, child emotional negativity and behavior were assessed using questionnaires and by direct observation. Latent trait-state-occasion modeling was used to represent maternal disorder symptom chronicity; both stable trait and time-specific occasion portions of maternal symptomatology were examined in relation to child outcomes. Only the stable trait portion of maternal MDD and GAD symptom severity were related to maternal report of child behavior problems and higher levels of emotional negativity. Persistent maternal MDD, but not GAD, symptom severity was related to higher levels of child emotional negativity as measured observationally. These data suggest that children’s behavior problems and emotional negativity are adversely affected by persistent maternal depression, and possibly anxiety. This has implications for interventions to prevent negative effects of postnatal psychopathology on children...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Preterm {{birth is}} {{associated}} with lower cognitive functioning. One potential pathway is <b>postnatal</b> parental <b>depression.</b> The authors assessed depressive symptoms in mothers and fathers after preterm birth, and identified the impacts of both prematurity and parental depressive symptoms on children's early cognitive function. METHOD: Data were from the nationally representative Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (n = 5350). Depressive symptoms at 9 months were assessed by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD) and children's cognitive function at 24 months by the Bayley Short Form, Research Edition. Weighted generalized estimating equation models examined {{the extent to which}} preterm birth, and mothers' and fathers' postnatal depressive symptoms impacted children's cognitive function at 24 months, and whether the association between preterm birth and 24 -month cognitive function was mediated by parental depressive symptoms. RESULTS: At 9 months, fathers of very preterm (< 32 weeks gestation) and moderate/late preterm (32 - 37 weeks gestation) infants had higher CESD scores than fathers of term-born (≥ 37 weeks gestation) infants (p value =. 02); preterm birth was not associated with maternal depressive symptoms. In multivariable analyses, preterm birth was associated with lower cognitive function at 24 months; this association was unaffected by adjustment for parental depressive symptoms. Fathers', but not mothers', postnatal depressive symptoms predicted lower cognitive function in the fully adjusted model (β = - 0. 11, 95 % confidence interval, - 0. 18 to - 0. 03). CONCLUSION: Fathers of preterm infants have more postnatal depressive symptomology than fathers of term-born infants. Fathers' depressive symptoms also negatively impact children's early cognitive function.

Participants completed questionnaires at 39 weeks gestation and 3 weeks after birth. Questionnaires measured demographic details, expected/actual infant characteristics, symptoms of anxiety and depression and the mother-baby bond (postpartum only). It was found that there was a significant difference between expectations and evaluations, with infants being perceived as less fussy, more adaptable and dull than they were expected to be. Both expectations of the baby and evaluation of the baby had a significant effect on the mother-baby bond. Women who expected their infant to have a more difficult temperament and then evaluated them, similarly reported a poorer mother-baby bond postpartum.

In both groups haematological parameters significantly increased without differences between the groups. EPDS score improved in both groups, but in the group A, the EPDS decrease was significantly larger (p< 0. 05) {{in comparison to the}} group B. This effect is mainly evident in subjects with a basal EPDS ≥ 12. An early examination of psychological condition could select "p. w. " with a high susceptibility to neuronal changes occurring postpartum. Vit&min favourably modulates brain functions antagonizing the evolution to "p. d". © 2013 Informa UK Ltd.

40|$|Abstract Background Increasing {{evidence}} suggests that <b>postnatal</b> paternal <b>depression</b> is associated with adverse emotional, behavioural and cognitive outcomes in children. Despite this, few studies have determined the prevalence of fathers’ depressive symptoms {{during the first few}} years of their children’s lives and explored what factors are related to these symptoms. We estimated the prevalence and examined associated risk factors of paternal depressive symptoms in a nationally representative sample of fathers with children aged between 9  months and 7  years old from the Millennium cohort study. The risk factors examined were maternal depressive symptoms, marital conflict, child temperament, child gender, paternal education, fathers’ ethnic background, fathers’ employment status, family housing, family income and paternal age. Methods Secondary data analysis was conducted using the UK Millennium cohort study, which consisted of data from England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland of families with infants born in the year 2000 / 2001. Data from four sweeps were used from when children in the cohort were aged 9  months, 3, 5 and 7  years old (n[*]=[*] 5155 – 12, 396). Results The prevalence of paternal depressive symptoms over time was 3. 6  % at 9  months, 1. 2  % at 3  years old, 1. 8  % at 5  years and 2. 0  % at 7  years (using Kessler cut-off points to categorise high depressive symptoms vs low depressive symptoms). Linear regression trends (using continuous measures of depressive symptoms) indicated that both paternal and maternal depressive symptoms decreased over time, suggesting similar patterns of parents’ depressive symptoms after the birth of a child, but the decrease was more evident for mothers. Paternal depressive symptoms were consistently associated with fathers’ unemployment, maternal depressive symptoms and marital conflict. Socioeconomic factors such as rented housing when child was 9  months and low family income when child was 5 and 7  years were also associated with higher paternal depressive symptoms. Conclusions Paternal depressive symptoms decreased among fathers when their children were aged between 9  months to 3  years old. Paternal unemployment, high maternal depressive symptoms and high marital conflict were important risk factors for paternal depressive symptoms. In light of our findings, we would recommend a more family centred approach to interventions for <b>depression</b> in the <b>postnatal</b> period...|$|R
