5|$|In halides, {{berkelium}} {{assumes the}} oxidation states +3 and +4. The +3 state is most stable, especially in solutions, and the tetravalent halides BkF4 and Cs2BkCl6 are only {{known in the}} solid phase. The coordination of the berkelium atom in its trivalent fluoride and chloride is tricapped trigonal <b>prismatic,</b> with a coordination number of 9. In the trivalent bromide, it is bicapped trigonal <b>prismatic</b> (coordination 8) or octahedral (coordination 6), and in the iodide it is octahedral.|$|E
5|$|Curium ions {{are hard}} Lewis acids and thus form most stable {{complexes}} with hard bases. The bonding is mostly ionic, {{with a small}} covalent component. Curium in its complexes commonly exhibits a 9-fold coordination environment, within a tricapped trigonal <b>prismatic</b> geometry.|$|E

5|$|Given its mythical {{connection}} with sailing and orchids, the name Pleione is {{often associated with}} grace, speed and elegance. Some of the finest designs in racing yachts have the name Pleione, and the recent Shanghai Oriental Art Center draws its inspiration from an orchid. Fat Jon in his new album Hundred Eight Stars has a <b>prismatic</b> track dedicated to 28 Tauri.|$|E
5|$|Perry {{began the}} <b>Prismatic</b> World Tour on May 7, 2014 at the Odyssey Arena in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The {{first leg of}} the tour also {{featured}} performances in Scotland and England that month. The second leg was announced on January 15, 2014, consisting of concerts in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. The leg ran from June to October 2014.|$|E
5|$|Prionodesmacea have a <b>prismatic</b> and nacreous shell structure, {{separated}} mantle lobes, poorly developed siphons, and hinge {{teeth that}} are lacking or unspecialized. Gills range from protobranch to eulamellibranch. Teleodesmacea {{on the other}} hand have a porcelanous and partly nacreous shell structure; Mantle lobes that are generally connected, well developed siphons, and specialized hinge teeth. In most, gills are eulamellibranch.|$|E
5|$|According to the parataxonomic {{system used}} to {{classify}} fossil eggs, Gobioolithus is {{classified in the}} oofamily Gobioolithidae, which, in turn, is classified in the <b>prismatic</b> morphotype (also called the neognath morphotype) of the ornithoid basic type. A cladistic analysis performed by Varricchio and Barta (2015) (pictured below) found Gobioolithus to be a sister taxon to Styloolithus. However, they considered Styloolithus different enough from Gobioolithus to warrant its excluslion from Gobioolithidae.|$|E
5|$|Group 18 Structure 2 is on {{the east}} side of the plaza. Its {{earliest}} phase dates to the Late Preclassic. The Preclassic remains consist of a low north wall running east-west. A later construction phase was built over this. It consisted of a rectangular platform that supported a bench. A small pyrite disc was found near the front wall. Obsidian <b>prismatic</b> blades were found on top of the platform, together with pieces of a thin earthenware bowl. Burial 69 was found in front of the base of the platform.|$|E
5|$|Other organothorium {{compounds}} are not well-studied. Tetrabenzylthorium, Th(CH2C6H5), and tetraallylthorium, Th(C3H5)4, are known, {{but their}} structures {{have not been}} determined and they decompose slowly at room temperature. Thorium forms the monocapped trigonal <b>prismatic</b> anion 3−, heptamethylthorate, which forms the salt 3 (tmeda = Me2NCH2CH2NMe2). Although one methyl group is only attached to the thorium atom (Th–C distance 257.1pm) and the other six connect the lithium and thorium atoms (Th–C distances 265.5–276.5pm) they behave equivalently in solution. Tetramethylthorium, Th(CH3)4, is not known, but its adducts are stabilised by phosphine ligands.|$|E
5|$|Panavision's first product—the Super Panatar {{projection}} lens—debuted in March 1954. Priced at $1,100, it {{captured the}} market. The Super Panatar was a rectangular box that {{attached to the}} existing projection lens with a special bracket. Its variable <b>prismatic</b> system allowed a range of film formats to be shown from the same projector with a simple adjustment of the lens. Panavision improved on the Super Panatar with the Ultra Panatar, a lighter design that could be screwed directly {{to the front of}} the projection lens. Panavision lenses gradually replaced CinemaScope as the leading anamorphic system for theatrical projection.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium(V) {{fluoride}} forms {{white crystals}} where protactinium ions {{are arranged in}} pentagonal bipyramids and coordinated by 7 other ions. The coordination is the same in protactinium(V) chloride, but the color is yellow. The coordination changes to octahedral in the brown protactinium(V) bromide and is unknown for protactinium(V) iodide. The protactinium coordination in all its tetrahalides is 8, but the arrangement is square antiprismatic in protactinium(IV) fluoride and dodecahedral in the chloride and bromide. Brown-colored protactinium(III) iodide has been reported where protactinium ions are 8-coordinated in a bicapped trigonal <b>prismatic</b> arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Some locally-made items {{included}} <b>prismatic</b> obsidian blades and a polished nodule of iron pyrite {{for use as}} a mirror. Other {{items included}} weapons and instruments for navigation. A mariner's astrolabe is the oldest such instrument with a confirmed date. Pewter objects from England were found and stoneware from Cologne, Germany. In the end about 1,500 artifacts were retrieved from the San Esteban, 85% of them from the conglomerates.|$|E
5|$|Stela 13 {{dates to}} the Late Preclassic. It is badly damaged, having been broken in two parts. It is carved in early Maya style and bears a design {{representing}} a stylised serpentine head, very similar to a monument found at Kaminaljuyu. Stela13 was erected {{at the base of}} the south side of Structure7A. At the base of the stela was found a massive offering of more than 600 ceramic vessels, 33 <b>prismatic</b> obsidian blades, as well as other artifacts. The stela and the offering are associated with the Late Preclassic royal tomb known as Burial1.|$|E
5|$|Structure 61, Mound61A and Mound61B {{are all on}} {{the east}} side of Terrace5, on the San Isidro plantation. Structure61 was built during the Early Classic and is dressed with stone, it was built upon an earlier {{construction}} dating to the Late Preclassic. Stela68 was found at the base of Mound61A near to a broken altar. Structure61 and its associated mounds may have been used to control access to the city during the height of its power, Mound61A was reused during the Postclassic occupation of the site. Early Classic finds from Mound61A include four ceramic vessels and four obsidian <b>prismatic</b> blades.|$|E
5|$|The luster of {{a diamond}} is {{described}} as 'adamantine', which simply means diamond-like. Reflections on a properly cut diamond's facets are undistorted, due to their flatness. The refractive index of diamond (as measured via sodium light, 589.3nm) is 2.417. Because it is cubic in structure, diamond is also isotropic. Its high dispersion of 0.044 (variation of refractive index across the visible spectrum) manifests in the perceptible fire of cut diamonds. This fire—flashes of <b>prismatic</b> colors seen in transparent stones—is perhaps diamond's most important optical property from a jewelry perspective. The prominence or amount of fire seen in a stone is heavily influenced by the choice of diamond cut and its associated proportions (particularly crown height), although the body color of fancy (i.e., unusual) diamonds may hide their fire to some degree.|$|E
5|$|A Late Preclassic tomb {{has been}} excavated, {{believed}} to be a royal burial. This tomb has been designated Burial1; it was found during excavations of Structure7A and was inserted into the centre of this Middle Preclassic structure. The burial is also associated with Stela13 and with a massive offering of more than 600 ceramic vessels and other artifacts found at the base of Structure7A. These ceramics date the offering {{to the end of the}} Late Preclassic. No human remains have been recovered but the find is assumed to be a burial due to the associated artifacts. The body is believed to have been interred upon a litter measuring , which was probably made of wood and coated in red cinnabar dust. Grave goods include an 18-piece jade necklace, two earspools coated in cinnabar, various mosaic mirrors made from iron pyrite, one consisting of more than 800 pieces, a jade mosaic mask, two <b>prismatic</b> obsidian blades, a finely carved greenstone fish, various beads that presumably formed jewellery such as bracelets and a selection of ceramics that date the tomb to AD100–200.|$|E
5|$|In acidic aqueous solution, thorium {{occurs as}} the tetrapositive aqua ion 4+, which has tricapped {{trigonal}} <b>prismatic</b> molecular geometry: at pH<3, the solutions of thorium salts {{are dominated by}} this cation. The Th4+ ion is {{the largest of the}} tetrapositive actinide ions, and depending on the coordination number can have a radius between 0.95and1.14Å. It is quite acidic due to its high charge, slightly stronger than sulfurous acid: thus it tends to undergo hydrolysis and polymerisation (though to a lesser extent than Fe3+), predominantly to 6+ in solutions with pH 3 or below, but in more alkaline solution polymerisation continues until the gelatinous hydroxide Th(OH)4 forms and precipitates out (though equilibrium may take weeks to be reached, because the polymerisation usually slows down before the precipitation). As a hard Lewis acid, Th4+ favours hard ligands with oxygen atoms as donors: complexes with sulfur atoms as donors are less stable and are more prone to hydrolysis.|$|E
5|$|In the foundry, Joule is able {{to analyze}} the <b>prismatic</b> core. She can make out voices coming from the core – {{including}} her father's – thus deducing {{that it is a}} transmission of sorts. Heading to Eden Tower to decrypt the core's transmission, she agrees to meet Kai there. Once reunited, they are ambushed by Victor. Kai stays behind to provide Joule the time to escape. She finds a lost crawler filled with parietal art indicating that Victor had manipulated the other corebots to attack the maintenance habitats. Corebot Duncan enters, lamenting the death of his human companion, and unites with Joule against Victor. Joule approaches Eden Tower to activate it, only to be faced with Victor and his minions. She learns that the ships, once orbiting Far Eden while waiting for its terraforming to complete, are long gone, having been destroyed by Victor. He throws Kai's prosthetic leg to the ground, proclaiming him dead. Finally, Joule bests Victor in combat and activates the terraforming system, materializing a hologram of her father from parts of memories hidden in the cores. In the end, it becomes clear that Kai survived his confrontation with Victor.|$|E
5|$|Mammals are {{a diverse}} class of animals, mostly {{terrestrial}} {{but some are}} aquatic and others have evolved flapping or gliding flight. They mostly have four limbs but some aquatic mammals have no limbs or limbs modified into fins and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings. The legs of most mammals are situated below the trunk, which is held well clear of the ground. The bones of mammals are well ossified and their teeth, which are usually differentiated, are coated in a layer of <b>prismatic</b> enamel. The teeth are shed once (milk teeth) during the animal's lifetime or not at all, {{as is the case}} in cetaceans. Mammals have three bones in the middle ear and a cochlea in the inner ear. They are clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete sweat. Some of these glands are specialized as mammary glands, producing milk to feed the young. Mammals breathe with lungs and have a muscular diaphragm separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs. The mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate. Nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea.|$|E
5|$|On the Pacific Coast ElBaúl Stela1 {{features}} a date in its hieroglyphic text that equates to 36 AD. It depicts a ruler bearing a sceptre or a spear {{with a double}} column of hieroglyphic text before him. At Takalik Abaj are two stelae (Stela2 and Stela5) depicting the transfer of power from one ruler to another; they both show two elaborately dressed figures facing {{each other with a}} column of hieroglyphic text between them. The Long Count date on Stela2 dates it to the 1st centuryBC at the latest, while Stela5 has two dates, the latest of which is 126 AD. The stela was associated with the burial of a human sacrifice and other offerings. Stela13 at Takalik Abaj also dates to the Late Preclassic; a massive offering of more than 600 ceramic vessels was found at its base, together with 33 obsidian <b>prismatic</b> blades and other artefacts. Both the stela and the offering were associated with a nearby Late Preclassic royal tomb. At Cuello in Belize, a plain stela was raised around 100 AD in an open plaza.|$|E
5|$|Steadily {{rising sea}} levels then further {{isolated}} this little island, which is entirely of volcanic origin. It {{consists of a}} basement of tuff, underneath colonnades of a black fine-grained Tertiary basalt, overlying which is a third layer of basaltic lava without a crystalline structure. By contrast, slow cooling of the second layer of basalt resulted in an extraordinary pattern of predominantly hexagonal columns which form the faces and walls of the principal caves. The lava contracted towards each {{of a series of}} equally spaced centres as it cooled and solidified into <b>prismatic</b> columns, a process known as columnar jointing. The columns typically have three to eight sides, six being most common. The columns are also divided horizontally by cross joints. These columnar jointed sections represent the tops and bottoms of individual lava flows. Between these sections lie regions of much more chaotic jointing, known as the entablature. The origin of the entablature is unknown, but could be due to flooding of the lava flow, causing much more rapid cooling, or the interaction of stress fields from the two regions of columnar jointing as they approach one another.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} layers at Mummy Cave {{yielded a}} few <b>prismatic</b> stone blades dating to about 7300BC. Several layers contained no artifacts and were defined by soot layers. By layer6 the first parallel-oblique points appeared. By Layer8, roughly corresponding to 6500BC, the cultural evidence became continuous. Layers8, 9, 10 and 12 produced lanceolate or leaf-shaped projectile points {{which have been}} interpreted as corresponding to Angostura-style points. This implies that the inhabitants of Mummy Cave during this era were big-game hunters from the Great Plains who adapted to the mountain environment. In layer16, radiocarbon dated to 5630BC, {{a new type of}} point appeared. These Blackwater side-notched points implied the arrival of a group from eastern Nebraska or western Iowa, replacing the previous group which may have moved to the north. The presence of such points suggests a connection with the Simonsen Site in northeastern Iowa, which has been dated to the Early Archaic period. This transition coincided with the climatic shift to the Altithermal. Side-notched points recovered from layers21, 24 and 28 imply a return of the previous inhabitants; the easterners had moved on to the central Columbian Plateau.|$|E
