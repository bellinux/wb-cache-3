5|$|As Ophelia was {{predicted}} to pass near southeast New England, the NHC issued tropical storm warnings {{for much of}} the south Massachusetts and Rhode Island coastlines. In Atlantic Canada, considerable preparations were taken for Ophelia, <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> of memories of Hurricane Juan of the 2003 season, which had caught the authorities off-guard. Ophelia prompted the Canadian Hurricane Centre's first ever tropical storm warnings which were canceled when Ophelia became extratropical.|$|E
5|$|He went to Saudi Arabia from 4 to 6 November {{in hopes}} of obtaining {{financial}} aid and securing trade agreements. However, leaked cables revealed increasingly strained relations between Zardari and Saudi royalty, <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> of Saudi distrust of Zardari and preference for Sharif. Weaker cooperation led to decreased oil subsidies {{as part of a}} broader Saudi policy of withholding monetary assistance.|$|E
5|$|It was the {{influence}} of Playford's mother Elizabeth that contributed to his relative Puritanism and social habits. She was a devout Baptist Christian, and it was <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> of her that he publicly abstained from alcohol, smoking, and gambling throughout his lifetime. However, despite her influence on his social habits, he did not regularly attend church like his family.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} [...] "Manhattan cocktail" [...] was {{a mix of}} [...] "American Whiskey, Italian Vermouth and Angostura bitters". During Prohibition (1920-1933) Canadian whisky was <b>primarily</b> used <b>because</b> it was available.|$|R

5000|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines use Babbitt metal which is <b>primarily</b> tin-based <b>because</b> it can withstand cyclic loading. Lead-based Babbitt tends to work-harden and develop cracks {{but it is}} suitable for constant-turning tools such as sawblades.|$|R
5|$|<b>Primarily</b> <b>because</b> of its Genesis bundling, Sonic the Hedgehog {{contributed to}} the console's {{popularity}} in North America. During October–December 1991, the Genesis outsold the Super NES by a two-to-one ratio, and at its January 1992 peak claimed 65 {{percent of the market}} for 16-bit consoles. Although Nintendo eventually again overtook Sega, {{this was the first time}} since December 1985 that the company did not lead the console market.|$|E
5|$|River Oaks {{has been}} the subject matter of {{scholarly}} studies, <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> its significant contributions to Houston's history and development as an elite suburban community. The community was the site of the 1972 murder of Dr. John Hill (later described in Thomas Thompson's novel, Blood and Money). River Oaks was the home of Jeff Skilling before he began serving a 25-year prison sentence for his involvement in the Enron scandal.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia {{has great}} human and {{economic}} costs. It {{results in a}} decreased life expectancy by 10–25years. This is <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> of its association with obesity, poor diet, sedentary lifestyles, and smoking, with an increased rate of suicide playing a lesser role. Antipsychotic medications may also increase the risk. These differences in life expectancy increased between the 1970s and 1990s.|$|E
50|$|Đinđić {{had made}} many enemies {{domestically}} throughout {{his political career}} <b>primarily</b> of <b>because</b> of his regard as being pro-Western and his hard-line policies on organized crime. Đinđić extradited Slobodan Milošević to the ICTY in 2001.|$|R
50|$|Steel is an alloy of {{iron and}} other elements, <b>primarily</b> carbon. <b>Because</b> of its high tensile {{strength}} and low cost, {{it is a major}} component in buildings, infrastructure, tools, ships, automobiles, machines, appliances, and weapons.|$|R
30|$|Finally, Bucher (2017) {{remarks that}} the FEARS index is <b>primarily</b> {{interesting}} <b>because</b> of its cross-sectional features at daily and weekly horizons. We, therefore, do not suspect {{that it will}} be useful for our portfolio strategies addressing much longer horizons.|$|R
5|$|The Bay Area {{is one of}} {{the wealthiest}} regions in the United States, due, primarily, to the {{economic}} power engines of San Jose, San Francisco, and Oakland. The Bay Area city of Pleasanton has the second-highest household income in the country after New Canaan, Connecticut. However, discretionary income is very comparable {{with the rest of the}} country, <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> the higher cost of living offsets the increased income.|$|E
5|$|The {{more massive}} the star, the shorter its lifespan, <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> massive stars have greater {{pressure}} on their cores, {{causing them to}} burn hydrogen more rapidly. The most massive stars last an average of a few million years, while stars of minimum mass (red dwarfs) burn their fuel very slowly and can last tens to {{hundreds of billions of}} years.|$|E
5|$|Whereas bismuth is most {{available}} {{today as a}} byproduct, its sustainability is more dependent on recycling. Bismuth is mostly a byproduct of the smelting of lead, and also of tungsten and copper production. Recycling bismuth is difficult in many of its end uses, <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> of scattering.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{the various}} {{theoretical}} advantages of PCI-X 2.0 and its backward compatibility with PCI-X and PCI devices, {{it has not}} been implemented on a large scale (...)

50|$|The {{only known}} {{occurrence}} of Marrite {{is the type}} locality of the Lengenbach quarry in Binntal, Valais, Switzerland. It is <b>primarily</b> formed <b>because</b> of hydrothermal activity, which involves water and high temperatures. Marrite is predominately found in dolomite along {{with a variety of}} other sulfosalts.|$|R
50|$|Urine {{analysis}} is <b>primarily</b> used <b>because</b> of its low cost. Urine drug testing {{is one of}} the most common testing methods used.

5|$|Eric Foner (2010) {{contrasts}} the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast who saw slavery as a sin, {{with the}} conservative Republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress. Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> it violated the republicanism principles of the Founding Fathers, especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the Declaration of Independence.|$|E
5|$|Greinke {{agreed to}} a six-year free agent {{contract}} with the Los Angeles Dodgers worth $147 million, on December 8, 2012. The deal, which was finalized on December 10, was the largest ever for a right-handed pitcher {{at the time it}} was signed. It was surpassed a year later by Félix Hernández's seven-year $175 million contract extension with the Seattle Mariners. Greinke later claimed that he chose the Dodgers over the Texas Rangers, who also were pursuing him, <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> they offered more money.|$|E
5|$|HD 154672 is {{a yellow}} subgiant (spectral type G3 IV). It is about 65 parsecs {{away from the}} Sun that is larger than, but of a similar mass to, the Sun. However, HD 154672 is much older. The star is very metal-rich, {{which is one of}} the reasons why it was {{targeted}} for a planet search by the N2K Consortium, which discovered the gas giant planet HD 154672 b using Doppler Spectroscopy; the discovery was reported in October 2008. The N2K collaboration chose HD 154672 <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> it aimed to discover the correlation between a star's metallicity and the mass of orbiting planets.|$|E

5|$|In August 1918, a more {{virulent strain}} {{appeared}} simultaneously in Brest, France; in Freetown, Sierra Leone; {{and in the}} U.S. in Boston, Massachusetts. The Spanish flu also spread through Ireland, carried there by returning Irish soldiers. The Allies of World War I came {{to call it the}} Spanish flu, <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> the pandemic received greater press attention after it moved from France to Spain in November 1918. Spain was not involved in the war and had not imposed wartime censorship.|$|E
5|$|Metals make {{relatively}} good conductors of heat, <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> the delocalized electrons {{are free to}} transport thermal energy between atoms. However, unlike electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity of a metal is nearly independent of temperature. This is expressed mathematically by the Wiedemann–Franz law, which states that the ratio of thermal conductivity to the electrical conductivity {{is proportional to the}} temperature. The thermal disorder in the metallic lattice increases the electrical resistivity of the material, producing a temperature dependence for electric current.|$|E
5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, the animal keepers were issued with rifles to deal with any dangerous animals who might escape if the gardens were bombed. A night shift was introduced to watch over the animals 24hours a day. A list of dangerous animals that was drawn up included 13lions, 6tigers, 2leopards, 1cheetah, 2tigons, 3other small cats and several bears. Although the zoo's administrators succeeded in convincing the local authorities that any danger from the animals was minimal, <b>primarily</b> <b>because</b> the perimeter walls were so high, the keepers were replaced in their sharp-shooting role by soldiers who patrolled the grounds armed with tommy guns.|$|E
50|$|Signed {{into law}} in 1975 by President Ford, this act was {{designed}} to cut the energy demand. Although this act <b>primarily</b> enacted <b>because</b> of oil shocks in the 1970s, it also encouraged programs, research and projects which dealt with alternative fuels. The Secretary of Energy was instructed to report feasibility and progress on this matter to Congress.|$|R
50|$|A {{possible}} evolutionary {{explanation for}} averageness is koinophilia, in which sexually-reproducing animals seek mates with <b>primarily</b> average features, <b>because</b> extreme and uncommon features {{are likely to}} indicate disadvantageous mutations.|$|R
