5000|$|A major {{application}} of <b>petrophysics</b> is in studying reservoirs for the hydrocarbon industry. Petrophysicists are employed to help reservoir engineers and geoscientists understand the rock {{properties of the}} reservoir, particularly how pores in the subsurface are interconnected, controlling the accumulation and migration of hydrocarbons. [...] Some of the key properties studied in <b>petrophysics</b> are lithology, porosity, water saturation, permeability and density. A key aspect of <b>petrophysics</b> is measuring and evaluating these rock properties by acquiring well log measurements - in which a string of measurement tools are inserted in the borehole, core measurements - in which rock samples are retrieved from subsurface, and seismic measurements. These studies are then combined with geological and geophysical studies and reservoir engineering to give a complete picture of the reservoir.|$|E

30|$|It {{is known}} that the change of {{porosity}} can better reflect the diagenesis effect on reservoir <b>petrophysics</b> by control factors analysis. The variation of porosity, as the control factor of permeability model, {{can be used as}} the characterization parameter of the model. In this study, the stratum has been classified into six kinds of electrofacies. A cluster is regarded as a distinct electroface reflecting formation hydrology, lithology, and diagenetic properties. By <b>petrophysics</b> analysis, a qualitative understanding is obtained by statistical description. It is understood that the electrofacies properties can be used as an important independent variable of permeability modeling on reservoir <b>petrophysics,</b> but there is a certain overlapping zone in pore-permeability distribution. No obvious and concrete boundary can be observed between different electrofacies. The electrofacies classification cannot be used as a single parameter to estimate permeability. SNK(Student–Newman–Keuls) method in multivariate variance analysis is used to verify and evaluate comparisons quantitatively for different electrofacies (Barr et al. 1977). If you draw a statistically significant conclusion, and further infer which groups are different, which groups are not different, or whether all groups are different, SNK method can quantitatively evaluate the difference of permeability between different electrofacies, and explain the relationship between electrofacies and permeability statistically. With Table  3, we can see similar conclusions with the descriptive analysis of <b>petrophysics</b> statistics analysis. N column represents the sample number and the values in subset are the calculated P values (Demuth 2006) in statistics. P value is the probability that a sample observation or more extreme result will occur when the null hypothesis is true. The dataset are divided into three subsets. Elec 1 and Elec 2 have similar <b>petrophysics,</b> so do Elec 4 and Elec 5. Elec 3 and Elec 6 have obvious overlapping behavior and Elec 5 also has {{a little bit of this}} behavior. This shows that there are some common <b>petrophysics</b> characteristics in different electrofacies, but the <b>petrophysics</b> have a wide fuzzy area and the electrofacies can be proved to be a very important discrete parameter that can reflect the permeability.|$|E
30|$|The {{accuracy}} rate of permeability calculation in the interval of 1230  m and 1275 – 1300  m {{is the highest}} with the core permeability (see Fig.  22). The main reason is that <b>petrophysics</b> characteristics in the overlying strata are significant with a larger thickness and between clear boundaries of electrofacies; the calculated permeability retains the lowest degree of accuracy with core permeability in the interval of 1250 – 1270  m with the <b>petrophysics</b> of the layer in middle permeability, low permeability and ultra-low permeability at the same time. More types, thin thickness and rapid changes in electrofacies and the complicated <b>petrophysics</b> characteristics of Elec 6 as the main component in the interval leads the logging response to be greatly affected by the adjacent layer with unmatched penetration information of the corresponding layer that cannot be correctly indicated.|$|E
30|$|Digenesis mainly {{consists}} of compaction, cementation, dissolution and metasomatism. The first three contributes {{more on the}} <b>petrophysics</b> of reservoir because metasomatism causes {{little effect on the}} <b>petrophysics</b> due to the slight extent of development and the small amount of generation. It {{can be seen from the}} micro-observation that the cementation of the reservoir is carbonate cementation. As is shown in Fig.  8, carbonate cementation is colored by red. Quartz grains in gray or white and other quartz grains with asphaltene in black or dark gray and long shape feldspar can also be seen.|$|E
30|$|From above cross-plot {{analysis}} (Figs.  8, 9), it {{is clear}} that the conditioned data are consistent, as the data from all the wells are following the same trend in the cross-plots. Hence, no normalization is required for using this data as input to <b>petrophysics</b> and rock physics studies.|$|E
30|$|Feature {{engineering}} {{is a typical}} work to determine the main effect factors and characterize the factor as a parameter in model (Qian et al. 2016). The first task {{is to figure out}} the main control factors of permeability. In general (Zeng and Li 2009), the <b>petrophysics</b> of the reservoir is controlled by the particle size, sorting, and diagenesis if no significant development of fracture is involved in the characteristics. (Abbaszadeh et al. 1996). The main factors that affect the <b>petrophysics</b> of oil reservoirs can be inferred by the convergence or divergence of the differential between porosity and permeability. If φ–K transforms in electrofacies is nearly overlapping and exhibiting minimal divergence in trend, homogenization by Diagenetic modification (Skalinski and Kenter 2015) may be inferred as a significant contributor to the fluid flow characteristics of the reservoir.|$|E
30|$|According to logging data analysis, {{the main}} factors {{affecting}} reservoir permeability are the homogenization effect caused by diagenesis. The cementation effect is not {{strong in the}} area. The <b>petrophysics</b> are mainly related {{to the effect of}} compaction and dissolution, and the change of pore value caused by diagenesis is used to characterize the transformation effect of diagenesis.|$|E
30|$|This step {{ensures that}} the {{required}} data are available in support of <b>petrophysics</b> and rock physics activities; it deals with improving well data which involve gaps correction and other unavoidable problems with gathered data. It also accounts for up-scaling when the need arises. The stage is an intensely visual process, requiring visualization tools and interactive manipulation widgets to make the process smooth, easy, and accurate.|$|E
30|$|With {{the quest}} for {{hydrocarbon}} prospects in frontier deep water settings characterized by complex rock fabric, detailed reservoir characterization is essential for accurate field management and production optimization. The presence of multi-pore architecture within such depositional environment makes their description from <b>petrophysics</b> very complex. Numerous models {{have been reported in}} the literature for permeability and flow units characterization utilizing various parameters for improved petrophysical evaluation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Study on Formation Type II is so {{few that}} affect on tapping the {{potential}} [2]. Analyzing <b>petrophysics</b> of Formation Type I and II by mercury injection curve normalization, it’s vital to developing method choice on tapping {{the potential of}} Formation Type II. Capillary pressure curves (Pc-curves) from conventional Mercury Injection are hard to analyze and compare because of various shapes. To get typical capillary pressure curves for Formation Type I and II, the curves from Mercury Injection is processed by Function J, and the J function curves and normalized Pc-curves for tabulated thin layers, tabulated thick layers and un-tabulated layers in Formation Type I and II, compare and analyze the influence of permeability on the shape of J function curves and normalized Pc-curves; compare the influence {{of different kinds of}} layers with the same permeability order of magnitude on the shape of J function curves and normalized Pc-curves, i. e. the influence of other factors except permeability, to get some visual identification methods and analyze the <b>petrophysics</b> difference between Formation Type I and II which is shown on Pc-curves...|$|E
40|$|The {{porosity}} in rock can {{be quantified}} and characterized {{using a variety of}} direct methods including imbibition methods, mercury injection, gas expansion, petrography, X-ray tomography, and image analysis. However many of them can be complex and more expensive than petrographic image analysis. In the oil industry, it is a common practice to use the indirect methods such as well-logs and seismic to identify rock properties like porosity and permeability. However, these methods do not always represent the physical reality and need to be calibrated with direct measurements. For that reason, the main objective of this project is to assess the efficiency and precision of petrographic image analysis to provide useful data for <b>petrophysics</b> studies. In order to face this problem, a database comprised of 400 high-resolution images of thin section slides extracted from carbonate rock samples is classified. Once classified, the samples are subjected to experimental methods of measuring porosity using petrographic imaging software. The results demonstrate the suitability of the methods to provide reliable data for <b>petrophysics</b> studies...|$|E
30|$|Reservoir {{characterization}} {{is defined}} as a combined technology using geostatistics, geophysics, <b>petrophysics,</b> geology, and reservoir engineering data to provide detailed description of the reservoir for better reservoir development planning to attain the highest recovery at minimum cost and reduce to a minimum uncertainty in production forecasts (Haldorsen and Damsleth 1993; Phillips 1996). Practical reservoir characterization for compartmentalized heterogeneous reservoirs still represents a real challenge for shaly formations and very difficult endeavor in the oil industry.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} two new sensors {{for measuring}} permeability and acoustic properties on slabbed core samples in the <b>petrophysics</b> laboratory. Prototypes were built {{to demonstrate that}} the new techniques are viable. The permeability sensor is the first non-contact, high spatial resolution, permeameter ever to have been developed; it has been called a micro-permeameter. It was calibrated using both synthetic and real rock samples. The collected data were compared with results from the industry-standard CoreLab PDPK- 400 mini-permeameter. The comparison shows that the new micro-permeameter is much faster than the CoreLab instrument. In addition, the new micro-permeameter is more sensitive to permeability changes and yet still makes more repeatable measurements. The uniqueness of the new micro-permeameter project resulted in the granting of US patent No. 6715341 (see Appendix D). The acoustic sensor developed is laser-based for the excitation stage only, and piezoelectric-based for the detection stage. The laser was tuned to generate acoustic waves in the rock without harming the rock surface. The new experimental method is comparable with exploration seismic surveys, but unique in the <b>petrophysics</b> laboratory. As a result, seismic software may be used to analyse the collected data. A significant discovery was made that not only was the new laser-acoustic system able to identify the standard direct-wave events, but also it reflected and refracted events never identified in <b>petrophysics</b> laboratory before. The standard velocity measurements for the pressure- wave (Yp) and the shear-wave (Ys) may now be made with a far greater accuracy than is possible with the established single-path method. Furthermore, the accuracy may now be measured statistically, rather than as an estimate. Direct measurements of amplitude-versus-offset (AYO) phenomena, which are impossible with the established method, may now be made. The results could be used to calibrate exploration seismic data, with fewer assumptions than the standard approach. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

3000|$|<b>Petrophysics</b> {{typically}} transforms {{measurements of}} GR, resistivity, and porosity into reservoir properties. Rock physics transmutes petrophysical results into Vp and Vs, and RHOB. Fluid substitution {{based on the}} Gassmann model is a tool used to map the variation of density at different saturation levels, inferring changes in seismic response. In this study, we presented an integrated analysis of <b>petrophysics</b> and fluid substitution of the Datta sands at the Chanda Oil Field, in northwest Pakistan. Based on the petrophysical interpretation of two wells, reservoir sand packages at the Datta sand level were identified. The crossover formed by density and neutron log, with corresponding sonic values, confirms the hydrocarbon presence in the sand packages. The modeled seismic response (velocities and density) for different saturation levels at the Datta sands predicts {{a significant increase in}} Vp as compared to Vs, which remain unaffected, and a decrease in density. This identified variation can be demonstrated using synthetic seismograms, which can be tied to the seismic data to map the saturation level of the subsurface. Such comparisons may be helpful during the development phase of a hydrocarbon field in minimizing the risk of well failure due to increased water saturation in the subsurface. The main conclusions derived from this study are: [...]...|$|E
