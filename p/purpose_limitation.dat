40|$|While student privacy {{has been}} a public issue for half a century, its {{contours}} change in response to social norms, technological capabilities, and political ideologies. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) seeks to prevent inaccurate or inappropriate information about students from being incorporated into pedagogical, academic, and employment decisionmaking. It does so by con- trolling who can access education records and, broadly, for what purposes. New education technologies take advantage of cloud computing and big data analytics to collect and share an unprecedented amount of information about students in class- rooms. Schools rely on outside, often for-profit, entities to provide these innovative tools. With the shift from education records to student data systems, privacy protection through access control {{does not account for}} the possibility that authorized recipients, or even educators themselves, might use student data for commercial or other non-educational purposes. Both FERPA and new state reforms rely on education <b>purpose</b> <b>limitations</b> as a compromise that allows schools to outsource data-reliant functions while addressing stake- holder concerns. However, current regulations define “education purposes” as information practices conducted on be- half of schools or pursuant to their authorization. Accordingly, they provide more procedural than substantive constraints. As with student privacy protections based on controlling access to education records, modern technological affordances limit the protection provided by education <b>purpose</b> <b>limitations.</b> Data-driven education tools change the nature of student information, the structure and method of school decisionmaking, and the creation of academic credentials. Broad education <b>purpose</b> <b>limitations</b> provide limited protection under these circumstances because they (1) treat education and non-education purposes as binary and mutually exclusive; (2) presume data practices serving education purposes align with students’ academic interests; (3) overlook the ethical complications created by “beta” education; (4) neglect the pedagogical effects of computerized instructional tools; and (5) discount the impact of data-driven technology on education itself.

This study {{was aimed at}} documenting the views and expectations of pregnant women concerning prenatal sonogram {{as well as their}} level of awareness of its <b>purpose,</b> <b>limitations</b> and safety in a predominantly Moslem society. A survey was carried out on a convenience sample of 150 patients referred from ante-natal clinics for prenatal sonogram, by administering semi-structured questionnaires. The results show that 61. 3 % of the women had prenatal sonogram, with little or no information about the <b>purpose,</b> capabilities and <b>limitations</b> of the procedure. 24. 7 % had neither formal western nor Islamic educational background that may have influenced their perceptions. Most of the women (81. 3 %) were sponsored by either government or their husbands, 72. 7 % perceived sonogram to be affordable and 63. 4 % viewed sonographic results as reliable. The perceived main reasons for having a prenatal sonogram were to determine the expected date of delivery and foetal well-being, and to obtain reassurance of maternal health. Sex determination and number of foetuses were the least considered reasons. The study indicates that providing pregnant women with adequate information and sensitising them to the <b>purpose</b> and <b>limitations</b> of sonograms is necessary to guarantee its rational utilisation.

40|$|Abstract: This paper puts {{forward a}} {{verification}} method for compound purposes and compound {{reasons to be}} used during <b>purpose</b> <b>limitation.</b> When it is absolutely necessary to collect privacy related information, {{it is essential that}} privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) protect access to data – in general accomplished by using the concept of purposes bound to data. Compound purposes and reasons are an enhancement of purposes used during <b>purpose</b> <b>limitation</b> and binding and are more expressive than purposes in their general form. Data users specify their access needs by making use of compound reasons which are defined in terms of (compound) purposes. Purposes are organised in a lattice with purposes near the greatest lower bound (GLB) considered weak (less specific) and purposes near the least upper bound (LUB) considered strong (most specific). Access is granted based on the verification of the statement of intent (from the data user) against the compound purpose bound to the data; however, because purposes are in a lattice, the data user is not limited to a statement of intent that matches the purposes bound to the data exactly – the statement can be a true reflection of their intent with the data. Hence, the verification of compound reasons against compound purposes cannot be accomplished by current published verification algorithms. Before presenting the verification method, compound purposes and reasons, as well as the structures used to represent them, and the operators that are used to define compounds is presented. Finally, some thoughts on implementation are provided...|$|E

40|$|The authors analyze {{innovations}} in data processing {{as a result}} of developments such as 'big data' and the 'Internet of Things' and discuss why these developments undermine the effectiveness and legitimacy of the current as well as upcoming EU data protection regime, thereby focusing on the private sector. The authors undertake a detailed analysis of key data processing principles used in the European data protection regime (<b>purpose</b> <b>limitation,</b> informational self-determination and data quality) and argue that due to social trends and technological developments the principle of <b>purpose</b> <b>limitation</b> should be abandoned as a separate criterion. Also, other principles (such as consent and the performance of an agreement) should no longer be recognised as independent legal grounds to legitimize data processing. The authors propose, instead, a test based on whether there is a legitimate interest for data collection and processing (as well as further processing) of data. The authors argue that such a test will provide for a more effective data protection regime that will have more legitimacy than the assessment under the existing legal regime that is primarily based on the purposes for which data may be collected and further used. Based on their analysis, the authors develop a framework to be used by companies as the principal (and only) test for the whole life cycle of personal data processing (collection, use, further use and destruction of data). This test has been drafted {{in such a way that}} it enables companies to comply with the new requirements under the upcoming EU General Data Protection Regulation, that will become effective in 2018.

40|$|This {{article is}} only {{available}} in Dutch. Many chains process personal data {{although it is}} not always crystal clear this is the case, for example when techniques such as pseudonyzing of number systems are used. Processing personal data is required to fulfill several requirements originating in the privacy law, such as <b>purpose</b> <b>limitation,</b> necessity, proportionality and data protection. An exchange of information which is developed under the theory of Chain Computerization largely fulfills these requirements. The chain analysis, the method of analyse of the theory, addresses multiple requirements. Despite this, it neglects two important elements of privacy, namely legality and self determination of the persons involved. In case these elements are neglected, the risk grows that an exchange of information develops conflicts with the law or is not considered to be acceptable by the organisations or persons involved. It may reduce the effectiveness of the cooperation. To apply to the privacy requirements, the chain analyses may be extended with several questions to determine risks in an early stage, providing the opportunity to mitigate these risks. ...|$|E
