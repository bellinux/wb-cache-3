40|$|A {{document}} {{discusses the}} creation of a high-voltage power supply (HVPS) that is able to contain voltages up to - 20 kV, keep electrical field strengths to below 200 V/mil (approximately equal to 7. 87 kV/mm), and can provide a 200 -nanosecond rise/fall time focus modulator swinging between cathode potential of 16. 3 kV and - 19. 3 kV. This HVPS can protect the 95 -GHz, pulsed extended interaction klystron (EIK) from arcs/discharges from all sources, including those from within the EIK fs vacuum envelope. This innovation has a multi-winding pulse transformer design, which uses new winding techniques to provide the same delays and rise/fall times (less than 10 nanoseconds) at different potential levels ranging from - 20 kV to - 16 kV. Another feature involves a high-voltage printed-wiring board that was corona-free at - 20 kV DC with a 3 - kV AC swing. The corona-free multilayer high-voltage board is used to simulate fields of less than 200 V/mil (approximately equal to 7. 87 kV/mm) at 20 kV DC. Drive techniques for the modulator FETs (field-effect transistors) (four to 10 in a series) were created to change states (3, 000 -V swing) without abrupt steps, while still maintaining required delays and transition times. The packing scheme includes a <b>potting</b> <b>mold</b> to house a ten-stage modulator in the space that, in the past, only housed a four-stage modulator. Problems keeping heat down were solved using aluminum oxide substrate in the high-voltage section to limit temperature rise to less than 10 while withstanding - 20 kV DC voltage and remaining corona-free...|$|E

For two years (1910-1912) master potter Frederick Rhead taught there; later the potter Albert Solon taught there. Thrown and <b>molded</b> <b>pots</b> were produced, usually with a matte finish.|$|R
40|$|A {{process for}} bonding {{elastomeric}} material to a metal part includes coating a heat curable adhesive on {{the surfaces of}} the metal part to be bonded. The metal part is placed in a mold, a bottom plate and an upper transfer pot of a transfer molding machine is preheated to a predetermined cure temperature. A predetermined quantity of uncured elastomeric material is loaded into the transfer <b>pot.</b> The <b>mold</b> containing the adhesive coated metal part is clamped to the bottom plate, and almost contemporaneously, the uncured elastomeric material is pressed into the mold while maintaining heat and pressure in the mold for a time sufficient to vulcanize and thereby cure the elastomeric material simultaneously with the adhesive, whereby contacting surfaces of the metal part are strongly bonded to the vulcanized elastomeric material...|$|R

50|$|Hermetic vs. Water-Proof vs. Water-Resistant {{refers to}} the {{coupling}} seal between the contacts, connector insert and body. A true hermetic connector provides an airtight seal and can support and maintain positive pressure or a vacuum. Waterproof connectors prevent liquid ingress when immersed {{using a variety of}} methods (e.g., <b>molding,</b> <b>potting</b> and encapsulating) to prevent water intrusion at high hydrostatic pressures. Water resistant implies that a coupled connector will prevent water ingress that can lead to shorting in shallow standing water or rain. Typically this is achieved by inserting rubber gaskets and compression seals at the contract region {{as well as at the}} cable entry.|$|R

5000|$|From time to time, the slug galley is {{transferred}} to the composing table to be set in the form, and once the press run is completed and the slugs removed from the form, they are tossed into the ‘hell box’ for remelting into new ingots. At intervals the lead is remelted and the oxidized metal (dross) skimmed off. As part of this process, ‘plus metal’ is added {{in the form of}} small ingots to replenish that portion of the alloyed metals that was lost by the formation of dross (by oxidization of the metal in the machine's pot or during the remelting stage). The type metal is poured into ingot molds: small molds for manually feeding the metal <b>pots</b> or larger <b>molds</b> for the metal feeders. (In the latter case, special attention must be given the ‘eye’ end as it has to support the weight of the entire ingot; failure often results in it dropping into the pot and splashing molten metal everywhere.) ...|$|R
2500|$|While Pakimé pottery is {{inspired}} by pre-Hispanic pottery, {{it is not an}} exact copy. Unlike other parts of Mexico, the pottery tradition broke completely here sometime during the colonial period. The current residents do not consider themselves to be the descendents of the Casas Grandes culture nor do their traditions tie to it. No one before Quezada's generation was involved with pottery. This has allowed the potters to experiment and test the limits of form and design, unlike many other Mexican potters who are constrained by generations of tradition. However, Quezada's recreation is interesting because he recreated two of the basic potting techniques from the pre-Hispanic period, the coil and molding methods. The raw clay is dug with a pick and shovel in the rugged foothills outside the town. It is cleaned by soaking it in water until it can be poured through a sieve. White clay is a favorite to work with but many colors are used. A potter's wheel is not used. The bottom of the <b>pot</b> is <b>molded</b> and the upper part is created by the coil method. When the pot is dry, it is rubbed with a stone or other hard object to make it shine. This can take days. Pots are fired on the open ground using wood and manure for fuel. Paints are made with mineral pigments collected locally. The pigments are ground into a powder using a metate grinding stone, then mixed with clay to [...] make a milky fluid paint. Many use traditional colors such as red, white and earth tones, but brighter colors have also been used. Brushes are made from dog, cat and even human hair.|$|R
40|$|Extruded pellets {{were made}} based on deoiled rice bran and paddy husk using {{glycerol}} and cashew nut shell liquid as plasticizer. Effects of incorporation levels of glycerol (GL, 6 to 14 %) and cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL, 6 to 14 %) {{on the physical}} and functional characteristics of extruded pellets based on deoiled rice bran and paddy husk powders were studied. For A 3 samples (12 % GL) radial expansion (RE- 1. 052), bulk density (BD- 0. 697 g/cm 3), water solubility index (WSI- 13. 000 %), water binding capacity (WBC- 5. 237 %) and hardness (HD- 498. 253 N) were observed. However, in case of B 3 samples (12 % CNSL), radial expansion (RE- 1. 019), bulk density (BD- 0. 567 g/cm 3), water solubility index (WSI- 15. 037 %), water binding capacity (WBC- 4. 785) and hardness (HD- 495. 027 N) were observed. Results indicated that GL and CNSL {{had a significant effect}} on physical and functional properties of the pellets. The results suggest that deoiled rice bran and paddy husk powder can be plasticized with glycerol and cashew nut shell liquid for the development of durable pellets using extrusion technology to be used further for the development of biodegradable <b>molded</b> <b>pots...</b>|$|R
40|$|An iron {{silicate}} (fayalite) based slag {{is formed}} in the secondary copper smelting process. This slag contains substantial amount of ZnO, CaO and Al 2 O 3 and minor components such as Na 2 O, PbO, MgO and Cr 2 O 3. This slag is of great importance to the copper smelting process and the entire production loop. The phase relations and the viscosity of the slag system at the smelting condition influences the process in both kinetic and thermodynamic ways. The cooling process has {{a great impact on}} the final microstructure of the solidified slag and further affects the following slag valorization applications. It is reported by the copper recycling industry that the copper smelting slag often has a high viscosity which may lead to problems in slag tapping. In the present study, the copper slag was observed in-situ with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). It was found that solid precipitation at the tapping temperature is the main reason of the increasing viscosity. In order to solve this problem, the phase relations in the industrial slag system ZnO-“FeO”-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -CaO (CaO/SiO 2 = 0. 05, Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 = 0. 15) were investigated by quenching samples after reaching equilibrium at 1423 K (1150 °C) under iron saturation. The equilibrium composition of the phases was determined with electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA). The effect of individual components, such as FeO, ZnO and CaO on the phase equilibrium of the slag system has been quantitatively studied. A high temperature rheometer system has been employed to study the rheological behavior of the industrial slag with iron saturation. Non-Newtonian behavior has been observed and the effect of the major components (FeO, ZnO and CaO) on the rheological property of the slag system has been investigated. The crystallization behavior of both ZnO containing slag (FeO-ZnO-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -CaO, FeO/SiO 2 = 2, ZnO = 9 wt. %, Al 2 O 3 = 5 wt. %, CaO = 1 wt. %) and ZnO free slag (FeO-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -CaO, FeO/SiO 2 = 1. 6, Al 2 O 3 = 5 wt. %, CaO = 1 wt. %) under various cooling rates was observed in-situ by CLSM. Continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagrams were constructed. The influence of the individual components of the slag, e. g. FeO, CaO and Al 2 O 3 on the crystallization behavior of the fayalite slag was systematically studied via water quenching experiments followed by a detailed EPMA-WDS micro-chemical analysis. Industrial scale experiments were carried out to study the cooling process of the copper smelting slag. The slag was cooled in an iron <b>pot,</b> a copper <b>mold,</b> a steel plate and quenched with water flow. XRF, XRD and EPMA were employed to characterize the slag. The cooling process was simulated with the software COMSOL, the temperature profile and the cooling rate were calculated. The relation between the cooling history and the microstructure of the solidified slag was investigated. Based on the experimental data, suggestions were given to the industry, including the modification of the slag chemical composition and the cooling process, in order to decrease the risk of problematic operation and to adapt the slag in higher added value utilizations. status: publishe...|$|R
