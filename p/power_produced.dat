The surplus <b>power</b> <b>produced</b> by domestic microgenerators can, in some jurisdictions, be {{fed into the}} network and sold to the utility company, producing a retail credit for the microgenerators' owners to offset their energy costs.|$|E
5|$|The cost of Nevada Solar One is in {{the range}} of $220–250million. The <b>power</b> <b>produced</b> is {{slightly}} more expensive than wind power, but was less than photovoltaic (PV) power. As photovoltaics became less expensive, some proposed CSP projects have been converted to photovoltaics projects.|$|E
5|$|Since 1969, the Hyatt {{plant has}} worked in tandem with an {{extensive}} pumped-storage operation comprising two offstream reservoirs west of Oroville. These two facilities are collectively known as the Oroville-Thermalito Complex. Water is diverted into the upper Thermalito reservoir (Thermalito Forebay) via the Thermalito Diversion Dam on the Feather River. During periods of off-peak power use, surplus energy generated at Hyatt is used to lift water from Thermalito's lower reservoir (the Thermalito Afterbay) to the forebay, which releases water back into the afterbay to generate up to 114 MW of power at times of high demand. The Hyatt and Thermalito plants produce an average of 2.2 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity each year, {{about half of the}} total <b>power</b> <b>produced</b> by the SWP's eight hydroelectric facilities.|$|E

5|$|With steam, mass-produced steel plate, and {{exploding}} shells, European gunships {{permitted the}} New Imperialism of the 19th century, forcing open access to Africa, China, Korea, and Japan for their merchants on favorable terms. Although internal politics hampered Chinese modernization, American naval <b>power</b> <b>produced</b> a major reform in Japan which bore fruit during the 1905 Battle of Tsushima when the Japanese {{were able to}} decisively defeat Russia. The great navies initially focused their efforts on constructing great dreadnoughts and battleships, but these fought inconclusively in the First World War. By contrast, the much cheaper German U-boats showed that submarines could cripple shipping even in waters nominally controlled by the enemy. Convoys, intelligence, and airborne ASW won a hard-fought victory in the Second World War's Battle of the Atlantic, but developments in applied physics meant that by the 1960s nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines were being maintained on constant patrol as a second-strike force along with {{a second set of}} hunters intended to counter them. Meanwhile, the battles of the Mediterranean and Pacific theaters of the war had shown that air power was capable of overcoming the strongest warships.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of wind {{power in the}} United States has been supported primarily through a production tax credit (PTC), which pays producers {{on the amount of}} electric <b>power</b> <b>produced.</b> On January 1, 2013 the production tax credit was extended for another year.|$|E
25|$|The {{ratio of}} fusion <b>power</b> <b>produced</b> to x-ray {{radiation}} lost to walls {{is an important}} figure of merit.

25|$|In a {{study from}} 1997, Delaware Solid Waste Authority found that, for same amount of {{produced}} energy, incineration plants emitted fewer particles, hydrocarbons and less SO2, HCl, CO and NOx than coal-fired power plants, but more than natural gas–fired power plants.

This is to be achieved mainly through the construction of wind farms and a number of hydroelectric stations.|$|E
25|$|Ships can bypass Niagara Falls {{by means}} of the Welland Canal, which was {{improved}} and incorporated into the Saint Lawrence Seaway in the mid-1950s. While the seaway diverted water traffic from nearby Buffalo and led to the demise of its steel and grain mills, other industries in the Niagara River valley flourished {{with the help of the}} electric <b>power</b> <b>produced</b> by the river.

50|$|The {{key to this}} is {{that workers}} {{exchange}} their labor power {{in return for a}} means of subsistence. In this example, the means of subsistence has not changed; therefore the wage is still only 3 dollars per day. Notice that while the labor only costs the capitalist 3 dollars, the labor <b>power</b> <b>produces</b> 12 hours worth of socially necessary labor time. The secret of surplus value resides in {{the fact that there is}} a difference between the value of labor power and what that labor <b>power</b> can <b>produce</b> in a given amount of time. Labor <b>power</b> can <b>produce</b> more than its own value.|$|R

25|$|A locomotive's {{control system}} is {{designed}} so that the main generator electrical power output is matched to any given engine speed. Given the innate characteristics of traction motors, {{as well as the}} way in which the motors are connected to the main generator, the generator will produce high current and low voltage at low locomotive speeds, gradually changing to low current and high voltage as the locomotive accelerates. Therefore, the net <b>power</b> <b>produced</b> by the locomotive will remain constant for any given throttle setting (see power curve graph for notch 8).|$|E
25|$|Assuming {{complete}} tritium burn-up, {{the reduction}} in the fraction of fusion energy carried by neutrons would be only about 18%, so that the primary advantage of the D-D fuel cycle is that tritium breeding would not be required. Other advantages are independence from scarce lithium resources and a somewhat softer neutron spectrum. The disadvantage of D-D compared to D-T is that the energy confinement time (at a given pressure) must be 30 times longer and the <b>power</b> <b>produced</b> (at a given pressure and volume) would be 68 times less.|$|E
25|$|Denmark was {{a pioneer}} in {{developing}} commercial wind power during the 1970s, and today a substantial share of the wind turbines {{around the world are}} produced by Danish manufacturers such as Vestas and Siemens Wind Power along with many component suppliers.

In 2012 the Danish government adopted a plan to increase the share of electricity production from wind to 50% by 2020, and to 84% in 2035. Denmark had the 6th best energy security in the world in 2014.|$|E
