The compressor was instrumented with high-response wall pressure modules and a static <b>pressure</b> <b>disc</b> probe for in-flow measurement, and a split-fiber probe for simultaneous measurements of velocity magnitude and flow direction. The data acquired to-date have indicated that a single fully developed stall cell rotates about the flow annulus at 50. 6 % of the rotor speed. The stall phenomenon is substantially periodic at a fixed frequency of 8. 29 Hz. It was determined that the rotating stall cell extends throughout the entire compressor, primarily in the axial direction. Spanwise distributions of the instantaneous absolute flow angle, axial and tangential velocity components, and static pressure acquired behind the first rotor are presented {{in the form of}} contour plots to visualize different patterns in the outer (midspan to casing) and inner (hub to mid-span) flow annuli during rotating stall.

Fifteen caprine lumbar discs with 5 mm of vertebral bone on either side were compressed by 1 Hz sinusoidal load for 4. 5 h. After preload, 'High' (130 ± 20 N) or 'Low' (50 ± 10 N) loads were alternated every half hour. Continuous intradiscal pressure measurement was performed with a pressure transducer needle. Each disc showed a linear relationship between axial compression and intradiscal pressure (R (2) > 0. 91). The intercept of linear regression analysis declined over time, but the gradient remained constant. Disc height changes were correlated to intradiscal pressure changes (R (2) > 0. 98) : both decreased during High loading, and increased during Low loading. In contrast, compressive stiffness increased during High loading, and was inversely related to intradiscal pressure and disc height.

Six human lumbar cadaveric {{functional}} spine units (FSU) were loaded in the neutral position with 600 N compression. Nucleus pressure measurements were obtained at 0 Nm, 0. 5 Nm, 1. 0 Nm and 2 Nm torsion torque. Posterior elements were removed and pressure measurements were repeated at the same torsion torques for the disc body unit (DBU). The pressure in the nucleus was measured by pulling a pressure probe through the disc along a straight path in the midsagittal plane. Results. There was {{no statistically significant difference}} of nucleus <b>pressure</b> or intervertebral <b>disc</b> height with different torsion torques among or between the FSU 2 ̆ 7 s and DBU 2 ̆ 7 s.

Therefore {{it is essential to}} have a suitable and effective condition monitoring system to assess the conditions of power transformers well in advance to maintain the reliability of the power system by averting unexpected expensive failures. Conventional condition. monitoring techniques do not conclusively indicate mechanical conditions of the transformer such as winding movement, loss ·of clamping <b>pressure,</b> <b>disc</b> movements etc. which can take place during handling and transport, short circuit forces, faults in the power system network near the transformer or a high voltage stress which affects inductance or capacitance. This project thesis deals with Frequency Response' Analysis technique for condition monitoring of power transformers, which is suitable for detecting the deformation of transformer windings. A mathematical model for obtaining frequency response characteristics has been developed for 'a typical transformer, and the effect of variation of parameters on frequency response has been examined. Case studies based on frequency response tests on typical 31. 5 MVA, 132 / 33 kV grid transformers have been presented. Case studies reveal that any mechanical deformation in the transformer winding is clearly reflected in the frequency response characteristics. The frequency response characteristics obtained in the field for different aged power transformers are found to be somewhat similar in nature to those obtained analytically using ladder network equivalent circuit...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose that}} the {{prevalence}} of bipolarity in Young Stellar Objects {{is due to the}} fine tuning that is required for spherical accretion of an ambient medium onto a central node. It is shown that there are two steady modes that are more likely than radial accretion, each of which is associated with a hyperbolic central point in the meridional stream lines, and consequently with either an equatorial inflow and an axial ejection or vice versa. In each case the stream lines pass through a thick accretion torus, which is better thought of as a standing pressure wave rather than as a relatively inert Keplerian structure. We base our arguments on a simple analytic example,which is topologi cally generic,wherein each bipolarmode is created by the rebound of accreting matter under the action of the thermal,magnetic,turbulent and centrifugal pressures created in the flow. In both bipolar modes the presence of non-zero angular momentum implies axial regions wherein the pressure is first reduced below the value at infinity and then becomes negative, where the solution fails because rotating material can not enter this region without suction. The model thus has empty stems where the activity of the central source must dominate. So the basic engine of the bipolar flow discussed here is simply the rebound of freely falling material from a thick <b>pressure</b> <b>disc</b> into an axial low pressure region. The low mass,high velocity outflow must be produced in this region by an additional mechanism. This is reminiscent of the cored apple structure observed recently in the very young bipolar source VLA 1623. Comment: PostScript, 10 page...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of glaucoma in rural Central India. METHODS: The population-based Central India Eye and Medical Study is a population-based study performed in a rural region of Central India. The study included 4711 subjects (aged 30 + years). A detailed ophthalmic and medical examination was performed. Glaucoma was defined by glaucomatous optic disc morphology, and in a second step, by the criteria of the International Society of Geographical and Epidemiological Ophthalmology (ISGEO). RESULTS: Optic disc photographs were available for 4570 (97. 0 %) subjects. Glaucoma was detected in 122 subjects (51 unilateral) (2. 67 % (95 %CI: 2. 20, 3. 14). Glaucoma prevalence for the age groups of 30 - 39 yrs, 40 - 49 yrs, 50 - 59 yrs, 60 - 69 yrs, 70 - 79 yrs, and 80 + years was 0. 54 % (95 %CI: 0. 11, 0. 98), 1. 03 % (95 %CI: 0. 49, 1. 57), 1. 40 % (95 %CI: 0. 58, 2. 23), 6. 62 % (95 %CI: 4. 92, 8. 31), 8. 71 % (95 %CI: 5. 55, 11. 75), and 14. 3 % (95 %CI: 4. 13, 24. 4), respectively. In multivariable analysis, glaucoma was associated with higher age (P< 0. 001), lower body mass index (P =  0. 025), lower blood hemoglobin concentration (P =  0. 03), higher intraocular pressure (P< 0. 001), disc hemorrhages (P< 0. 001), higher prevalence of myopic retinopathy (P< 0. 001), lower level of education (P =  0. 03), longer axial length (P< 0. 001), thinner retinal nerve fiber layer (P< 0. 001), higher vertical cup/disc diameter ratio (P< 0. 001), and narrow anterior chamber angle (P =  0. 02). Ratio of open-angle glaucoma to angle-closure glaucoma was 7. 7 : 1 (1. 93 % (95 %CI: 1. 64, 2. 22) to 0. 24 % (95 %CI: 0. 14, 0. 34)). Using the ISGEO criteria, glaucoma prevalence was 2. 8 % (95 %CI: 2. 3, 3. 3) with a less clear association with older age.

Associated factors were older age, lower body mass index, lower blood concentration of hemoglobin, lower level of education, higher intraocular <b>pressure,</b> <b>disc</b> hemorrhage, myopic retinopathy, and longer axial length.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{have been}} some {{disagreements}} on the comparison of <b>disc</b> <b>pressures</b> in the standing and sitting postures in literature. Most research on in vivo pressure needle measurement found higher <b>disc</b> <b>pressure</b> in sitting than in standing. The <b>disc</b> <b>pressure</b> data can help to advocate better postures for clinical advice. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of this paper is}} to develop a procedure to study the compressive load on intervertebral joint in the standing and sitting postures through the approach of motion capture and musculoskeletal modeling. METHODS: The marker data of six subjects performing various standing and sitting postures was obtained during the motion capture experiment and used to train the musculoskeletal model with an enhanced discretized spine developed for subject in the inverse and forward simulations. RESULTS: Compressive loads on L 3 -L 4 and L 4 -L 5 joints are found higher in upright sitting than in upright standing. Slumped sitting, cross-legged sitting and flexion sitting can introduce higher compressive loads on intervertebral joints compared with upright sitting. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate the effects of standing and sitting postures on the spinal joint loads. The results can provide doctors and therapists with more information on clinical advice on better postures for people with spinal problems...|$|R

However, some important issues {{still need to be}} addressed to quantify the role of MRI in discs; in particular no systematic investigation {{of the role of the}} physical dimensionless parameters of the problem on the dimensionless transport has been undertaken yet. For completeness, we first generalize existing results on the marginal stability limit in the presence of both viscous and resistive dissipation, exhibit simple scalings for all relevant limits, and give them a physical interpretation. We then re-examine the question of transport efficiency through numerical simulations in the simplest setting of a local, unstratified shearing box, with the help of a pseudo-spectral incompressible 3 D code; viscosity and resistivity are explicitly accounted for. We focus on the effect of the dimensionless magnetic field strength, the Reynolds number and the magnetic Prandtl number.
