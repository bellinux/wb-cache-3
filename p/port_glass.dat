40|$|International audienceThe deeper {{understanding}} of the factors that affect the dimensionless figure of merit, ZT, and the use of new synthetic methods has recently {{led to the development of}} novel systems with improved thermoelectric performances. Albeit up to now with ZT values lower than the conventional bulk materials, semiconducting glasses have also emerged as a new family of potential thermoelectric materials. This paper reviews the latest advances on semiconducting glasses for thermoelectric applications. Key examples of tellurium-based glasses, with high Seebeck coefficients, very low thermal conductivities and tunable electrical conductivities, are presented. ZT values as high as 0. 2 were obtained at room temperature for several tellurium-based glasses with high copper concentrations, confirming chalcogenide semiconducting glasses as good candidates for high-performance thermoelectric materials. However, the temperature stability and electrical conductivity of there <b>ported</b> <b>glasses</b> are still not good enough for practical applications and further studies are still needed to enhance them...|$|R
40|$|A {{study has}} been {{conducted}} to determine the feasibility of applying gas reburn to glass tanks for NOx emissions control. Three model furnaces representing the main furnace types were evaluated: a 250 ton per day end <b>port</b> container <b>glass</b> furnace, a 500 ton per day side <b>port</b> flat <b>glass</b> furnace, and a 125 ton per day recuperative fiber glass furnace. The evaluation consisted of conceptual reburn system designs, a thermal analysis, an estimate of NOx removal achievable, and an economic analysis. It was found that NOx reductions {{on the order of}} 80 percent may be expected for the regenerative glass furnaces, and 65 percent for the recuperated furnace. The cost of control is estimated to be 25 to 33 {{percent of the cost of}} oxy-fuel. Potential complications are an estimated increase on the order of 200 graden F in gas temperatures throughout the regenerator and a decrease in fuel efficiency of up to 10 to 12. 4 percent...|$|R
60|$|So we drank, {{measuring}} out {{the water}} in a little india-rubber cup which we had with us. It held about as much as a <b>port</b> wine <b>glass,</b> and each of us drank, or rather slowly sipped, three cupfuls; we who felt as though we could have swallowed a gallon apiece, and asked for more.

50|$|By about 710, in {{the middle}} of Ine's reign, the trading {{settlement}} of Hamwic had become established on {{the west bank of the}} river Itchen; the site is now part of the modern city of Southampton. The goods traded at this <b>port</b> included <b>glass</b> vessels, and finds of animal bones suggest an active trade in hides. Further evidence of trade comes from finds of imported goods such as quernstones, whetstones, and pottery; and finds of sceattas from the town include Frisian coins. Specialist trades carried on in the town included cloth-making, smithying, and metalworking. It is not known whether Ine took an interest in Hamwic, but some of the goods he favoured, including luxuries, were imported there, and the merchants would probably have needed royal protection. The total population of Hamwic has been estimated at 5,000, and this high population itself implies Ine's involvement, since no-one but the king would have been able to arrange to feed and house such a large group of people.|$|R

5000|$|Located 1.5 km {{from the}} main city Venice, Italy, Murano has been a {{commercial}} port since {{as far back as}} the 7th century.

Murano glass is the largest proportion of Venetian glass.|$|R
60|$|I {{had to go}} to work at {{his picture}} again, and to paint him entirely different.

Men who have seen the world, and been sworn at Highgate; who are used to tavern life; up to all the tricks of tapsters, and knowing in the ways of sinful publicans. Free-livers on a small scale; who are prodigal within the compass of a guinea; who call all the waiters by name, touzle the maids, gossip with the landlady at the bar, and prose over a pint of <b>port,</b> or a <b>glass</b> of negus, after dinner.|$|R
5000|$|Occasionally {{housings}} {{might be}} advertised as [...] "waterproof housings" [...] rather than underwater housings. Waterproof housings {{are not intended}} for deep water use, but rather are splash protection housings for use around the pool, in rain, or to protect if dropped overboard. At the most they are for very shallow activities - usually not more than about 1 or 2 metres / 3 to 6 feet in depth. One manufacturer offers a plastic bag type housing with a watertight seal, and a <b>glass</b> <b>port</b> front. The flexible bag allows some modest camera control, but when taken deeper the air inside the bag compresses from the pressure and makes the controls nearly impossible to operate. These bags are usually limited to shallow snorkeling activities and damage to the bag may cause irreparable flooding damage.|$|R

The fused silica mirrors currently undergoing testing in the SIRTF are sunk into a liquid He reservoir with copper straps, whose individual strands are soldered to small silver spots diffused throughout the unfigured side of the mirror to accomplish fast conductive cooling. Optical access to the cold mirror is by means of a small <b>glass</b> <b>port</b> in the vacuum chamber. An interferometer is used to examine the mirror figure throughout the cool-down.

Finally, a cluster of cooler but still self-luminous, high-density debris is observed to travel at 1. 8 cm/{mu}s. Additional experiments were carried out to study the plasma flow and reconvergence inside the liner cavity by inserting a diverting disk along the axis of implosion.

50|$|Monturiol had {{originally}} {{wanted to build}} his pressure hull out of metal {{in the interests of}} strength but he and his financial backers lacked sufficient funds, so he instead settled for wood, with which he was familiar since his father was a cooper. The pressure hull was constructed from olive wood, supported with oak rings, and covered in 2 mm of copper, and measured 4 m long, 2 m at its highest, and 1 m wide. Monturiol calculated that it should be able to maintain its integrity to a depth of 500 m, although he only rated it to 50 m for the sake of safety. The outer streamlined hull was 7 m long, 2.5 m high, and displaced 10 tonnes. Several thick <b>glass</b> <b>ports</b> were installed on the sides, top, and bow of the Ictineo; these were semi-conical in shape so that water pressure would tend to force them more firmly into their seats and so avoid leaks.|$|R
50|$|There are optical {{problems}} with using cameras inside a watertight housing. Because of refraction, the image {{coming through the}} <b>glass</b> <b>port</b> will be distorted, especially with wide-angle lenses. A dome-shaped or fish-eye port corrects this distortion. Most manufacturers make these dome ports for their housings, often designing them {{to be used with}} specific lenses to maximize their effectiveness. The Nikonos series allowed the use of water-contact optics—lenses designed to be used submerged, without the ability to focus correctly when used in air. There is also a problem with some digital cameras, which do not have sufficiently wide lenses built in; to solve this, there are housings made with supplementary optics in addition to the dome port, making the apparent angle of view wider. Some housings work with wet-coupled lenses, which are screwed on to the outside of the lens port and increase the field of view; these lenses may be added or removed under water, allowing both macro and wide-angle photography on the same dive.|$|R
25|$|This IFV variant is {{essentially}} a Fahd 240, fitted with a dual-weapon turret that has a 12.7mm machine gun and a 7.62mm machine gun. The addition of a turret requires a third crewman, the gunner, {{but it does not}} affect the Fahd 240's passenger capacity. The turret is the French BTM-208 turret, produced under license from the French SAMM company. It is air-tight, and provides NBC protection. It incorporates and aiming telescopic periscope, forward–observation, rotating mirror periscope in co-axial alignment with weapons, and five or six bullet-proof <b>glass</b> <b>ports</b> insuring all-round vision and ballistic protection. 200 rounds are provided for the 7.62mm machine gun, and another 100 for the 12.7mm machine gun. Elevation limits are -8 and +45, the turret provides 360 degrees of traversion for the weapons. The vehicle has a rotating seat, and an armored hatch for the turret. The machine guns can be fired by means of a foot pedal, freeing the gunner's hands. A central console groups control switches and warning lights governing weapon selection. The addition of a turret increases the vehicle height to 2.85 meters.|$|R
