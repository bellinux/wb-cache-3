5|$|The Solomon Islands skink (Corucia zebrata), {{also known}} as <b>prehensile-tailed</b> <b>skink,</b> monkey-tailed skink, giant skink, zebra skink, and monkey skink, is an {{arboreal}} species of skink endemic to the Solomon Islands archipelago. It is the largest known extant species of skink.|$|E
500|$|The Solomon Islands skink {{was first}} {{described}} by John Edward Gray in 1855 as Corucia zebrata. [...] The generic name Corucia {{derives from the}} Latin word [...] coruscus meaning [...] "shimmering". [...] This is in reference to Gray's description of [...] "a play of colors effect from the body scales". [...] Its specific name zebrata is a Latinized form of the word zebra, {{in reference to the}} animal's zebra-like stripes. [...] Some of its common names (<b>prehensile-tailed</b> <b>skink,</b> monkey-tailed skink, monkey skink) refer to its fully prehensile tail which the species uses as a fifth limb for climbing.|$|E
500|$|The Solomon Islands skink has a long, slender body, strong, short legs, and a {{triangular}} shaped head with small round eyes. [...] The skink {{has a strong}} crushing jaw but the teeth are small and used for eating plant material. [...] Its prehensile tail helps it maneuver from branch to branch with ease and gives the skink its more common names: monkey-tailed skink, <b>prehensile-tailed</b> <b>skink,</b> or monkey skink. Male Solomon Islands skinks {{tend to have a}} broader head and a more slender body shape than do female skinks. [...] Males have a [...] "V"-shaped pattern of scales just aft of the cloacal opening, which is not present in female skinks.|$|E
50|$|The Adaptations exhibit {{features}} {{animals that}} have {{in some way}} adapted to their surroundings in nature with a main focus on nocturnal adaptions. Animals include North American river otters, ocelots, Egyptian fruit bats, fennec foxes, naked mole rats, <b>prehensile-tailed</b> <b>skinks,</b> seahorses, and Hoffmann's two-toed sloths.|$|R
50|$|As part of {{conservation}} programs, the Utica Zoo has housed Mexican wolves, red pandas, white-naped cranes, white-handed gibbons, Mexican spider monkeys, golden lion tamarins, golden-headed lion tamarins, California sea lions, <b>prehensile-tailed</b> <b>skinks,</b> collard peccaries and snowy owls. Its current collection includes African lions, Hartmann's mountain zebras, and California sea lions, and the petting zoo features Nigerian dwarf goats.|$|R
50|$|Early 2013 saw {{the opening}} of a new meerkat {{enclosure}} alongside the currently under construction reptile and small mammal building. In late March 2013, a new jungle gym for children to play in was built next door the safari skyride, replacing an exhibit that once held Indian muntjacs, Stanley cranes, and African spurred tortoises. The Indian muntjacs have been moved to a non-public area, the Stanley cranes had moved to the Safari Ride and the African spurred tortoises had moved near the orangutan island. In mid-April 2013, a Baird's tapir and a Ruppell's griffon vulture were added to the zoo, and can be seen in a safari-ride preserve area. A capybara was added to the South America yard in late April 2013. In 2015 phase 1 of the Reptile Building opened to the public to view various reptiles and amphibians, including the Komodo dragon. In August 2016, a new serval exhibit opened adjacent to the bat exhibit. The zoo will have new animals include pygmy hippos and giant anteaters on Summer 2017. On June 26, the reptile house was expanded with a new hallway containing 13 additional exhibits for 15 new species including rhino iguanas, rhino rat snakes, Madagascar tree boas, <b>prehensile-tailed</b> <b>skinks,</b> Dominican mountain boas, veiled chameleons, and emerald tree boas. Later this year, the African clawless otters will move to a new home near the playground, and two new primate islands similar to the existing ones holding chimpanzees and orangutans will be made to be viewed from the Safari Train Ride.|$|R

40|$|Field {{observations}} of Sanford 2 ̆ 7 s Sea-Eagle Haliaeetus (leucogaster) sanfordi were {{obtained in the}} Solomon Islands (Choiseul, Tetepare, Rendova, Kolombangara, and Vella Lavella) from January 2006 to October 2011. Sanford 2 ̆ 7 s Sea-Eagles were encountered in coastal, lowland and montane forests (to 1100 m above sea-level), open human-modified habitats, and along a river through primary rainforest. Prédation or attempted prédation was observed on soaring Glossy Swiftlets Collocalia esculenta, Solomons Flying-foxes Pteropus rayneri leaving their roosts and a <b>Prehensile-tailed</b> <b>Skink</b> Corucia zebrata. Ecological release may explain this eagle 2 ̆ 7 s wide habitat and dietary niche in the Islands, but other evidence (morphology, vocalisations) suggests that lumping it with the White-bellied SeaEagle H. leucogaster, on limited DNA evidence, may be premature...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Prehensile-Tailed</b> <b>Skink</b> (Corucia zebrata) (Scincidae) is {{endemic to}} the Solomon Archipelago, where it inhabits all major islands. The species is {{evolutionarily}} distinct and diverged from its nearest relatives during the Oligocene. To expand on the limited information available {{with respect to}} the life history and ecology of C. zebrata in the wild, we explored the species' prevalence to group living and the fine-scale genetic structure of a large and isolated population. Fifty-one lizards were sampled in a 900 -ha study plot within a larger area of continuous rain forest on Ugi Island in the Solomon Islands, an area that represents approximately 20 % of the C. zebrata habitat on the island. Using information from eight polymorphic DNA microsatellite loci, we conducted Bayesian assignment analysis and pairwise kinship estimates between individual lizards. No geographically induced subpopulation structure was detected. The majority of lizards were not found in immediate proximity of other individuals; however, pairwise kinship analysis showed that lizards located less than 150 m from each other were likely to share alleles identical by descent and, thus, were more related than by chance. Additionally, we found indications that individual lizards have moved several kilometers within the study area. We have uncovered information on dispersal and genetic structure in a large population of C. zebrata, a species whose natural habitat across the Solomon Archipelago is increasingly fragmented and degraded because of unsustainable logging.
