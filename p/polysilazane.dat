50|$|The liquid-ammonia-procedure was {{developed}} by Commodore/KiON for <b>polysilazane</b> synthesis. It calls for adding chlorosilane or chlorosilane mixtures simultaneously to an excess of liquid ammonia. The resulting ammonium chloride dissolves in the liquid ammonia and phase separates from the <b>polysilazane.</b> Two immiscible liquids form. This allows for the simple isolation of pure <b>polysilazane</b> from the liquid ammonia/ammonium chloride solution. The patented procedure is used today by AZ Electronic Materials {{in the manufacture of}} polysilazanes.|$|E
50|$|Polysilazanes are {{polymers}} {{in which}} silicon and nitrogen atoms alternate {{to form the}} basic backbone. Since each silicon atom is bound to two separate nitrogen atoms and each nitrogen atom to two silicon atoms, both chains and rings of the formula R^1R^2Si-NR^3_\mathit{n} occur. R^1-R^3 can be hydrogen atoms or organic substituents. If all substituents R are H atoms, the polymer is designated as Perhydropolysilazane, Polyperhydridosilazane or Inorganic <b>Polysilazane</b> (H2Si-NH). If hydrocarbon substituents are bound to the silicon atoms, the polymers are designated as Organopolysilazanes. Molecularly, polysilazanes R^1R^2Si-NH_\mathit{n} are isoelectronic with and close relatives to Polysiloxanes R^1R^2Si-O_\mathit{n} (silicones).|$|E
50|$|Polysilazanes are colorless to {{pale yellow}} liquids or solid materials. Conditional of manufacturing, the liquids often contain {{dissolved}} ammonia {{that can be}} detected by smell. The average molecular weight can range from a few thousand to approximately 100,000 g/mol while the density normally lies around 1 g/cm3. The state of aggregation and the viscosity are both dependent on the molecular mass and the molecular macrostructure. Solid polysilazanes are produced by chemical conversion of the liquid materials (crosslinking of smaller molecules). The solid materials can be fusible or unmeltable and can be soluble or insoluble in organic solvents. As a rule, <b>polysilazane</b> solids behave as thermosetting polymers, but in some cases, thermoplastic processing is possible.|$|E

50|$|With contact {{to water}} or moisture, <b>polysilazanes</b> {{decompose}} {{more or less}} quickly. Water molecules attack the silicon atom and the Si-N bond is cleaved. The R3Si-NH-SiR3 forms R3Si-NH2 and HO-SiR3 which can further react (condensation) to form R3Si-O-SiR3 (siloxanes). The rate of the reaction with water (or other OH containing materials like alcohols) depends on the molecular structure of the <b>polysilazanes</b> and the substituents. Perhydropolysilazane H2Si-NH n will decompose very quickly and exothermically with contact to water while <b>polysilazanes</b> with large substituents react very slowly.|$|R

5000|$|Physical and {{chemical}} properties of pre-ceramic polymers can be varied {{in a wide}} range by chemical modifications. This is crucial for the production of ceramic fibers, an important topic both at universities and in industrial research. Silicon carbide fibers made from polycarbosilanes were the first to be used for reinforcement of ceramic matrix composites. The production of silicon nitride fibers from perhydropolysilazane was described by Tonen Corp. {{at the end of the}} 1980s. Dow Corning modified the HPZ polymer as a precursor for SiCN fibers, and Hoechst AG did successful experiments with VT50. More recently, G. Singh at Kansas State University demonstrated synthesis of boron-modified <b>polysilazane</b> for synthesis of Si(B)CN functionalized carbon nanotubes, which were stable in air up to 1000 C. The PDC-CNT composites are being explored for applications such as damage resistant coatings for high power laser thermal detectors [...] as well as Li-ion battery anodes.|$|E
50|$|Polysilazanes are not vaporizable {{because of}} strong intermolecular forces. Heating polysilazanes results in {{crosslinking}} to form higher molecular weight polymers. At temperatures of 100-300 °C, further crosslinking of the molecules takes place with evolution of hydrogen and ammonia. If the <b>polysilazane</b> contains further functional {{groups such as}} vinyl units, additional reactions can take place. In general, liquid materials will be converted to solids as the temperature increases. At 400-700 °C, the organic groups decompose with the evolution of small hydrocarbon molecules, ammonia and hydrogen. Between 700 and 1200 °C a three-dimensional amorphous network develops containing Si, C and N ("SiCN ceramics") with a density of ca. 2 g/cm3. A further temperature increase can result in crystallization of the amorphous material {{and the formation of}} silicon nitride, silicon carbide and carbon. This so-called pyrolysis of the polysilazanes produces ceramic materials from low-viscosity liquids with very high yield (up to 90%). Due to the organic groups that are often used to give good polymer processability, ceramic yield is normally in the range of 60-80%.|$|E

In contrast to these fire-retardants, <b>polysilazanes</b> act as ceramizing agents. <b>Polysilazanes</b> are suitable fire-retardants for resin transfer molding due to their low viscosity. Both burning behavior and glass transition temperature (T-g) are investigated as important application properties. In contrast to state-of-the-art fire-retardant formulations polysilazane-based thermosetting hybrid resins burn with high intensity and fast extinction.

50|$|Taking {{advantage}} of their reaction with moisture and polar surfaces, <b>polysilazanes</b> are used as coating materials. Many metals, glass, ceramics or plastics with OH groups on the surface are easily wetted by <b>polysilazanes.</b> Reaction of Si-N with OH leads {{to the formation of}} Si-O-metal bonds generating good adhesion of the coating to the substrate. The “free” surface of the coating can react with humidity thereby creating a siloxane-like structure with excellent “easy to clean” properties.

40|$|Cu(In,Ga) Se 2, {{in short}} CIGS, solar cells have {{received}} considerable attention among photovoltaic solar cells {{because of their}} high conversion efficiency, flexibility and lightweight. The challenge in CIGS technology nowadays {{is not only to}} enhance performances but also to find low cost processing options. The use of CIGS modules built from monolithic interconnected cells on steel sheets is a promising solution; however it requires an additional dielectric layer interposed between the substrate and the entire active stack. Thus, the focus of this thesis was to elaborate a novel dielectric systems prepared on steel substrates and to optimize molybdenum layers as contacts for the fabrication of “high temperature” flexible CIGS solar cells. <b>Polysilazane</b> hybrid polymers were identified and explored to act as a dielectric layer for CIGS solar cells. Coatings were performed on stainless steel substrates using a straightforward “bar coating” deposition method which is suitable for industrial rolling processes. The problem with <b>polysilazane</b> coatings is that they often suffer from thermal instability and cracking due to the high annealing temperature required for growing the CIGS absorbing layer. Indeed, our thermal analysis reveals an important mass loss of around 25 wt. % for type of <b>polysilazane</b> we use. The mass reduction was assigned to chemical transformations of the polymer evidenced by volatilization of different gases and evolution of solvent. Such degradations show a severe weakening of the dielectric strength of <b>polysilazane</b> coatings. It was shown that polysilazanes can be stabilized after annealing at 550 °C. <b>Polysilazane</b> single layers with a thickness below 2 µm are crack-free even after annealing but, unfortunately do not fulfill the dielectric requirements. Single layers with a thickness higher than 2 µm systematically cracked after annealing. With a subtle combination of three layers of <b>polysilazane</b> and a sputtered SiOxAly layer we succeeded in growing a crack-free dielectric stack with total thickness of more or less 4 µm. Constant voltage stress measurements performed on metal-insulating-metal capacitors reveal that such dielectric stacks can tolerate an applied voltage of 1000 V before annealing and 500 V after annealing at 500 °C. Optimization of Mo films was then performed on dielectric stacks and a method to produce crack-free and well-adhered Mo films was established. Two solutions were found and each solution was obtained by combining two different layers. Both solutions pass adhesion testing and exhibit very low sheet resistance required for Mo back contacts. The interface between a set of Mo films and <b>polysilazane</b> was also studied. There seems to be a link between Mo-O-Si covalent bonds and good adhesion at the interface. Adhesion loss observed for some Mo/polysilazane samples occurred due to decohesion in <b>polysilazane</b> itself. The decohesion is assigned to the weakening of <b>polysilazane</b> due to the formation of molybdenum carbide at the interface. Finally, the analysis of steel modified by ultra-thin <b>polysilazane</b> reveals the presence of Cr-O-Si and Fe-O-Si covalent bonds which may explain the good adhesion observed with polysilazane/steel samples.
