5|$|Just {{before her}} death, Oliver had been shortlisted for the 2006 Clemenger Contemporary Art Award. In the year following, Oliver was amongst 60 artists <b>profiled</b> <b>in</b> Sonia Payes' book Untitled: Portraits of Australian Artists, while in 2008 her final works were {{included}} in the Adelaide Biennale of Australian Art. The secondary art market, meanwhile, was returning six-figure sums for her works at auction; in 2007 a record for Oliver's work was set when Skein (2004) went under the hammer for $192,000. By 2010, Sydney Biennale chairman Luca Belgiorno-Nettis was reported to have paid $300,000 for one of Oliver's sculptures, titled Tracery. In 2011, Sydney's College of Fine Arts announced that its new sculpture studio would be named after Oliver.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the mechanisms involved {{in the development of}} saturation <b>profiles</b> <b>in</b> soil. A series of laboratory tests were conducted to monitor the saturation <b>profiles</b> <b>in</b> four types of soil under various rainfall conditions. The understanding <b>in</b> saturation <b>profile</b> is essential to predict the shear strength of soil, particularly for slope stability problem. The study showed that the saturation <b>profile</b> <b>in</b> soil could be effectively monitored through a fabricated soil column model. The effect of rainfall pattern on the saturation profile of coarse-grained soil is relatively insignificant. Conversely, the saturation <b>profile</b> <b>in</b> fine-grained soil could be significantly altered when the soil is subjected to a prolonged rainfall. It is believed that the findings from the present study could lead to better understanding of saturation <b>profile</b> <b>in</b> soil, and subsequently contributing efforts in mitigating rainfall-induced slope failure...|$|R

5|$|Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1927, Dworsky {{lived in}} the Twin Cities and Sioux Falls, South Dakota before {{attending}} the University of Michigan. Dworsky was a four-year starter for Fritz Crisler's Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1945 to 1948. He played linebacker, fullback, and center for the Michigan Wolverines and was a key player on the undefeated 1947 and 1948 Michigan football teams that won consecutive national championships. The 1947 team, anchored by Len Ford, Alvin Wistert, Dworsky and Rick Kempthorn, {{has been described as}} {{the best team in the}} history of Michigan football. Dworsky won a total of six varsity letters at Michigan, four in football and two in wrestling where he competed in the heavyweight division. Dworsky is among the famous Jews in football, and has been extensively <b>profiled</b> <b>in</b> encyclopedic Jewish publications. Dworsky married the former Sylvia Ann Taylor on August 10, 1957.

5|$|In 1978, Avery {{leaves the}} Chronicle, {{and moves to}} the Sacramento Bee. Graysmith {{persistently}} contacts Toschi about the Zodiac murders, and eventually impresses the veteran detective with his knowledge of the case. While Toschi cannot directly give Graysmith access to the evidence, he provides contact names of other police departments in other counties where Zodiac murders occurred. Armstrong transfers from the San Francisco Police homicide division, and Toschi is demoted for supposedly forging a Zodiac letter. Graysmith continues his own investigation, which is <b>profiled</b> <b>in</b> the Chronicle, and he allows himself to be interviewed on television about his book-in-progress concerning the case. He begins receiving anonymous phone calls with heavy breathing. Because of his immersion in the case, Graysmith loses his job and his wife Melanie leaves him, taking their children with her. Graysmith acquires more information that points to Allen as the Zodiac, and although circumstantial evidence seems to indicate his guilt, the physical evidence, such as fingerprints and handwriting samples, do not implicate him.|$|E
