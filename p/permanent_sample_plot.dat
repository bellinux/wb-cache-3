40|$|Quantitative {{study of}} the <b>permanent</b> <b>sample</b> <b>plot</b> (PSP) {{database}} can provide insights into growth, mortality and recruitment processes driving forest dynamics. Modelling the dynamics of forest growth and yield provides opportunities for optimising silvicultural systems and generating accurate growth and yield estimates, which are fundamental to sustainable forest management. This paper will outline model development based on analysis of a large native forest <b>permanent</b> <b>sample</b> <b>plot</b> database in Papua New Guinea. We quantify the competitive influences affecting individual tree growth and mortality, and build predictive models for growth and mortality based on a hierarchical Bayesian modelling methodology. This method allows the parameterisation of a global model with species-specific parameters; therefore, species-level growth and mortality traits are preserved in model predictions, even for rare species. We examine a range of spatial and non-spatial competition indexes for the data, and conclude that a simple non-spatial competition index (basal area of competing trees within 20 metres of the subject) adequately characterises competitive influences on growth and mortality. In future work, species-specific model parameters {{can be used as}} the basis of a forest simulation system (see [URL] for developments) to improve the design and intensity of selectiveharvesting regimes at the community and the concession level.

The {{calculation procedure}} is based on treewise expansion factors and the division of trees sampled into state/measurement classes. Nine classes were required for variable size plots and six for fixed size plots. A relascope plot with basal-area factor 1 (m 2 /ha) proved to be most efficient for estimating basal-area at a given time and a fixed size circular plot with radius 10 m for estimating basal-area increment over a given time period. The main problems were related to the estimation of non-measurable variables, e. g., the initial diameters of ingrowth trees, i. e., trees having passed the threshold size during the measurement period.

The idea is to estimate all parameters of the sub-models of a growth simulator simultaneously in such a way that, when simulation begins from the diameter distribution at the first measurement occasion, it yields a similar ending diameter distribution as measured in the second measurement occasion. The method was applied to Pinus patula <b>permanent</b> <b>sample</b> <b>plot</b> data from Kenya.

The effects of both site quality class and drainage phase were stronger on pine mires than on spruce mires, most probably due to the longer fertility gradient and large potential free growing space in the former group.
