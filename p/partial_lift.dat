50|$|Local {{production}} {{is estimated at}} 7 million chickens in 2005, which represents a 33% increase compared to 2004. Chicken meat production represents about 75% of this production, and total industrial production of chicken meat has increased to 9,200 tons in 2005, representing a 26% increase compared to 2004. Traditional production (home production) is difficult to evaluate but could be estimated at 8,000 tons of meat. Preliminary government reports suggest that these trends will continue in 2006 with significant increase in local production of chicken meat. However, these trends also suggest that the production of eggs will decrease significantly {{as the result of}} the competing chicken meat, and professionals fear that the sector might not be able to meet Senegal's needs in chicken eggs, which may prompt a <b>partial</b> <b>lift</b> of the ban.|$|E
50|$|It was {{announced}} in May 2009 that TAAG had passed IATA inspections. In , TAAG received permission to operate flights to Europe under restricted conditions, as it was allowed to fly only into Portugal and using only its three Boeing 777s. This <b>partial</b> <b>lift</b> of the ban made TAAG the only Angolan airline that was permitted to operate into the EU. After nearly two years of being banned from EU airspace, TAAG deployed its own aircraft on the European corridor immediately. TAAG then returned the Boeing 747-400 to South African Airways. In November 2009, the European Commission extended the permission to TAAG's four Boeing 737-700s. Also in November 2009, TAAG restarted services to Havana; many Cuban doctors and teachers reside in Angola and the flight exists to help transport them. In late March 2010, restrictions over TAAG operations were relaxed again following the announcement the airline could fly its Boeing 777-200ERs and 737-700s to all European airports.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies market {{discipline}} on banks by depositors in Japan. We {{stress the importance}} of depositors ’ selection of banks, which together with regulatory and supervisory schemes can strengthen corporate governance in banking. The effectiveness of depositor discipline is, however, weakened by the existence of deposit insurance system. In order to examine the effectiveness of depositor discipline in Japan, we use a sample of 120 banks during the period FY 1998 to FY 2001, and find that depositors’ tendency to select banks based on asset risk exposure clearly strengthened ahead of the <b>partial</b> <b>lift</b> of the freeze on the payoff system (April 2002). At the same time, depositors, expecting “too-big-to-fail ” policy by the government, tended to opt for larger banks regardless of their risk exposures and performance. The latter selection mechanism, however, would not offer good discipline on banks. Makeshift solutions to containing banking crises such as delaying the full introduction of the payment system and promoting bank mergers may invite further moral hazard among banks and potentially lead to destabilization of the financial system...|$|E
40|$|In {{multicellular}} organisms, one-cell-thick monolayer {{sheets are}} the simplest tissues, yet they play crucial roles in physiology and tissue engineering. Cells within these sheets are tightly connected {{to each other}} through specialized cell-adhesion molecules that typically cluster into in discrete patches called cell-cell junctions. Working together, these junctional organelles glue cells to their neighbors, integrate the cytoskeletons into a mechanical syncytium and transduce a variety of mechanical signals. Human bodies offer many vivid illustration of how a cell sheet physiology changes considerably during development and diseases, as shown in epidermal blistering and certain cardiomyopathy. Despite the extensive molecular and clinical work on cell junctions, relevant in vitro experimental data are often masked by cell-substrate interactions {{due to a lack}} of suitable experimental methods. It is therefore important to develop novel in vitro methods for characterizing how junctional proteins, as well as tightly associated cytoskeletal proteins, may modulate various cellular behaviors, such as viability and apoptosis, cell-cell adhesiveness and tissue integrity. Control over cell viability is a fundamental property underlying numerous physiological processes. Cell-cell contact is likely to play a significant role in regulating cell vitality, but its function is easily masked by cell-substrate interactions, thus remains incompletely characterized. In the first part of this thesis, we developed an enzyme-based whole cell sheet lifting method and generated substrate- and scaffold-free keratinocyte (N/TERT- 1) cell sheets. Cells within the suspended cell sheets have persisting intercellular contacts and remain viable, in contrast to trypsinized cells suspended without either cell-cell or cell-substrate contact, which underwent apoptosis at high rates. Suppression of junctional protein plakoglobin weakened cell-cell adhesion in cell sheets and suppressed apoptosis in suspended, trypsinized cells. These results demonstrate that cell-cell contact may be a fundamental control mechanism governing cell viability and that the plakoglobin is a key regulator of this process. The study also laid groundwork for subsequent characterization and manipulation of viable cell sheets for cell sheet engineering purpose. Cell sheet engineering, characterized by harvest of cultured cell monolayer as a scaffold-free sheet, was recently developed. Particularly, cell sheet engineering based cardiac tissue engineering has emerged as an alternative method for the repair of damaged heart tissue. Such an engineered cell sheet offers a new way to study cell junctions when substrate interactions are no longer dominant. While this method is promising, it is limited by the fragility and shrinkage of the sheets as well as the lack of information regarding the characteristics of such sheets. In next part of the thesis we pursued two related research projects by developing a novel partial-lift method to generate strong, unshrunk substrate-free and scaffold-free cell sheets, first using skin cells and then refined and expanded to cardiac cells. The rationales for this approach are the ease with which skin cells can be manipulated, the similarities in cell junctions between skin and cardiac cells, and their potential clinical applications. These partially-lifted cell sheets engage primarily in cell-cell interactions, yet are amenable to biological and chemical perturbations and, importantly, mechanical conditioning. This simple yet powerful method was then deployed to test the hypothesis that the lifted cells would exhibit substantial reinforcement of key cytoskeletal and junctional components at cell-cell contacts, and that such reinforcement would be enhanced by mechanical conditioning. Results further demonstrate that the mechanical strength and cohesion of the substrate-free cell sheets strongly depend on the integrity of the actomyosin cytoskeleton and expression of the junctional protein plakoglobin. Moreover, our results showed that dissociating cell-substrate interactions and implementing mechanical conditioning enhances contraction, calcium signaling, alters viscoelastic property, and thus improves the functional cell-cell coupling in the cardiac sheets. In sum, this thesis represents a first systematic examination of junctional regulation of cell viability and mechanical conditioning on cells with primarily cell-cell interactions. The information gained from this study will help advance our understanding of cell-cell interactions and improve cell sheets biomechanical properties. For tissue engineering purposes, our dispase-based partial-lift cell sheet harvesting method has the advantage of being biocompatible, easily applicable, rapidly collectable and stretchable, compared to currently available techniques. This simple yet powerful <b>partial</b> <b>lift</b> technique has enormous potential for fabricating clinically applicable skin and cardiac tissues...|$|E

40|$|Fuel direct {{injection}} {{represents one of}} the key turning points {{in the development of the}} Diesel engines. The appeal of this solution has been growing thanks to the parallel advancement in the technology of the injection hardware and in the knowledge of the physics involved in the spray formation and combustion. In the present thesis, the effect of <b>partial</b> needle <b>lift</b> and injection rate shaping has been investigated experimentally using a multi-orifice Diesel injector. Injection rate shaping is one of the most attractive alternatives to multiple injection strategies but its implementation has been for long time impeded by technological limitations. A novel direct-acting injector prototype made it possible to carry out the present research: this injector features a mechanical coupling between the nozzle needle and the piezo-stack actuator, allowing a fully flexible control on the nozzle needle movement and enabling <b>partial</b> needle <b>lift</b> as well as the implementation of alternative injection rate shapes typologies. Different optical diagnostics were applied to study the spray development and combustion in a novel continuous flow test chamber that allows an accurate control on a wide range of thermodynamic conditions (up to 1000 K and 15 MPa). In addition, hydraulic characterization tests were carried out to analyze the fuel flow through the injector nozzle. <b>Partial</b> needle <b>lift</b> has been found to affect the injection event, reducing the mass flow rate (as expected) but also causing a reduction in the effective orifice area and an increase on the spreading angle. Moreover, at this condition, higher hole-to-hole dispersion and flow instabilities were detected. Needle vibrations caused by the needle interactions with fuel flow and by the onset of cavitation in the needle seat are likely the causes of this behavior. Injection rate shaping has a substantial impact on the premixed phase of the combustion and on the location where the ignition takes place. Furthermore, the results proved that the modifications in the internal flow caused by the <b>partial</b> needle <b>lift</b> are reflected on the ignition timing. On the other hand, the analysis of the experimental data through a 1 D spray model revealed that an increasing mass flow rate (e. g. ramp or boot injection rate profiles) causes an increase in the fuelair equivalence ratio at the lift-off length and a consequent higher soot formation during the diffusive phase of the combustion. Finally, the wide range of boundary conditions tested in all the experiments served to draw general conclusions about the physics involved in the injection/combustion event and, in some cases, to obtain statistical correlations.
