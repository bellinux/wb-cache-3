25|$|Treating with alkali {{produces}} Dutch-process cocoa powder, {{which is}} less acidic, darker, and more mellow in flavor than what is generally available {{in most of the}} world. Regular (nonalkalized) cocoa is acidic, so when cocoa is treated with an alkaline ingredient, generally potassium carbonate, the pH increases. This process can be done at various stages during manufacturing, including during nib treatment, liquor treatment, or <b>press</b> <b>cake</b> treatment.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the in vitro degradation and total gas production of different oil seed <b>press</b> <b>cakes</b> from a biodiesel production chain gas {{through the use of}} a semi-automatic technique of gas production in vitro. The treatments consisted of substituting elephant grass in increasing levels, 0 %, 30, 50 and 70 %, with the byproducts of Gossyypium hirsutum, Ricinus communis, Moringa oleifeira, Jatropha curcas and Helianthus annus. The oil seed <b>press</b> <b>cakes</b> of Moringa oleifeira had the highest rate of in vitro degradation of dry matter compared with other foods but did not result in a higher final volume of gases production. Gossyypium hirsutum, Pinh&# 227;o manso curcas and Ricinus communis showed a higher in vitro degradability of similar dry matter. The highest total gas production was obtained by the oil seed <b>press</b> <b>cakes</b> of Helianthus annus. The oil seed <b>press</b> <b>cakes</b> of Moringa oleifeira can replace elephant grass up to 70 % and therefore reduce both greenhouse gas emissions and energy loss for the animal...|$|R
5000|$|Some foods whose {{processing}} creates <b>press</b> <b>cakes</b> are olives for {{olive oil}} (pomace), peanuts for peanut oil, coconut flesh for coconut cream and milk (sapal), grapes for wine (pomace), apples for cider (pomace), and soybeans for soy milk (used to make tofu) (this is called okara) or oil. Other common <b>press</b> <b>cakes</b> come from flax seed (linseed), cottonseed, and sunflower seeds. However, some specific kinds may be toxic, and are rather used as fertilizer, for example cottonseed contains a toxic pigment, gossypol, {{that must be}} removed before processing.|$|R

5000|$|In crude {{olive oil}} production, the {{traditional}} system, i.e. pressing, and the three-phase system produce a <b>press</b> <b>cake</b> and {{a considerable amount}} of waste water while the two-phase system, which is mainly used in Spain, produces a paste-like waste called [...] "alperujo" [...] or [...] "two-phase pomace" [...] that has a higher water content and is more difficult to treat than traditional solid waste. The water content of the <b>press</b> <b>cake,</b> composed of crude olive cake, pomace and husk, is about 30 percent if it is produced by traditional pressing technology and about 45-50 percent using decanter centrifuges. The <b>press</b> <b>cake</b> still has some oil that is normally recovered in a separate installation. The exhausted olive cake is incinerated or used as a soil conditioner in olive groves.|$|E

40|$|Sub-Saharan West Africa lacks {{of natural}} resources, {{especially}} for energy production. By-products of agro-industry as cashew nut shells (CNS), jatropha (Jc) and shea (Sc) <b>press</b> <b>cakes</b> {{were identified as}} available resources for energetic valorisation. These biomasses are characterised by high extractive contents (cashew nut shell liquid/CNSL or triglycerides) which are the reason for toxic fumes during combustion. The thesis investigated the feasibility of flash pyrolysis as alternative process for these resources, more specifically {{the impact of the}} extractives on yields, the composition and the stability of flash pyrolysis oils. The feedstock were derived into samples covering the whole range of extractive contents (from de-oiled <b>press</b> <b>cakes,</b> ~ 0 wt%; to pure extractives, 100 wt%) which were characterised and pyrolysed in two laboratory devices (TGA and tubular furnace), then by applying flash pyrolysis conditions in a fluidised bed reactor. No significant interaction in-between the solid matrix and the extractives during pyrolysis were observed but different products were identified. CNSL volatises between 250 and 320 °C, several phenolic compounds and typical compounds of crude CNSL were found to be present in the pyrolysis oil. In contrast, triglycerides are entirely decomposed at 380 to 420 °C to give linear hydro-carbon chains. Some interaction products of the triglycerides with proteins were identified. Additionally, the experiments with the pilot plant have shown operational difficulties in the fluidised bed, which are linked to specific properties of the <b>press</b> <b>cakes.</b> Thus, further optimisations of process conditions are suggested. To overcome the observed phase separation of the pyrolysis oils mixtures with other biofuels were studied. The obtained emulsions are more homogeneous but the physical stability is still insufficient despite the addition of surfactants. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

2500|$|The {{incoming}} sewage {{ran through}} a catch pit, which removed large debris, {{and into the}} precipitation tanks. Liquid {{was removed from the}} top, and sludge from the bottom. The sludge was mixed with lime in three sludge pits, and then <b>pressed</b> into <b>cakes.</b> Initially, the works produced around 738 tons of <b>pressed</b> <b>cake</b> per week. Some 50 tons a day were sold as fertiliser, with the rest being carried by the railway to the old river bed for dumping. The liquid flowed along an open channel to [...] of land, which was used for land filtration, before the treated effluent was discharged into the Ship Canal. The process was inadequate for the volumes entering the works, and the canal became increasingly polluted. Consideration was given to discharging the effluent into the tidal River Mersey, by construction of a culvert to Randall's sluices, near Warrington, or treating it by the use of septic tanks and double-contact bacteria beds. The second option was chosen, as the first would have reduced the flow in the Ship Canal.|$|R
50|$|The initial {{installation}} produced vegetable oil from palm kernels, seeds, nuts and fruits with <b>press</b> <b>cakes</b> as a byproduct, all sold as animal feed.

The oil industry {{at the time was}} characterized by a few large, international corporations and Aarhus Oliefabrik followed this pattern. The company bought production facilities and established subsidiaries across Europe, especially England, while trade companies and trade posts were established in countries producing the necessary raw materials.|$|R
