40|$|Background: Recent reviews {{suggest that}} {{enhancing}} fitness and functional capacity prior to surgery can accelerate post-surgery recovery and reduce mortality. However, {{the effect of}} <b>pre-surgical</b> <b>exercise</b> interventions in cancer patients is not fully explained. The aim {{of this paper is}} to systematically review the available literature regarding pre-surgery exercise training interventions in cancer patients and examine their effects on physiological outcomes as well as quality of life (QOL) and length of hospital stay. Methods: Relevant studies were identified through a search on MEDLINE, PreMEDLINE, AMED, MEDLINE Daily Update, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs that had some form of physical exercise undertaken prior to surgery were included. Descriptive characteristics such as participant characteristics, study design, types of cancer, length of study, and primary outcomes were extracted. Methodological rigour was assessed using a modified Delphi List. Due to the heterogeneity and the dearth of pre-surgical studies, we were limited to a systematic review rather than a meta-analysis. Results: Eighteen studies were included consisting of a total of 966 participants. Lung cancer studies were the predominant group represented. Most of the studies prescribed an aerobic intervention programs done prior to surgery. Mode, frequency, duration, and intensity of exercise intervention varied across the different cancer groups. The majority of studies showed preliminary positive change in clinical outcomes with significant improvements in the rate of incontinence, functional walking capacity and cardiorespiratory fitness. Conclusion: <b>Pre-surgical</b> <b>exercise</b> may benefit cancer patients through positive effects on function and physical capacity. Surgical oncologists may consider <b>pre-surgical</b> <b>exercise</b> interventions as a potential adjuvant therapy to improve patients 2 ̆ 7 outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Prostatectomy is an {{effective}} and a common treatment for localised prostate cancer. Despite a reduction in prostate cancer mortality, this procedure has negative implications to physical function, continence and sexual health. Exercise {{has been shown to}} counteract this spectrum of associated disorders. Hence, exercise as an intervention strategy can reduce many adverse effects. Effective investigation into the relationship between <b>pre-surgical</b> <b>exercise</b> and the adverse effects of surgery has the potential to provide cancer survivors with faster recovery and better quality of life...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Strategies {{to improve}} {{pre-operative}} cardiopulmonary fitness could positively impact recovery aftersurgery. This {{study investigated the}} feasibility of pre-operative vigorous intensity aerobic interval exercise inbladder cancer patients prior to radical cystectomy (RC). Methods: A total of 60 patients were randomised (1 : 1) to an exercise or control group following a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). The exercise group wasoffered twice-weekly pre-operative supervised vigorous intensity aerobic interval exercise in addition tostandard treatment, whilst the controls received standard treatment only. A repeat CPET was undertaken beforesurgery and post-operative recovery outcomes were recorded. Results: Over half of the 112 eligible patientsapproached in the clinic were recruited to the study (53. 5 %), with 52 of the 60 recruited patients (87 %) attending both pre-operative CPETs and post-operative recovery data being available for 55 of the patients(92 %). Patients attended a median of 8 (range: 1 - 10) exercise sessions over a pre-operative period of 3 - 6 weeks. Improvements in peak values of oxygen pulse (P= 0. 001), minute ventilation (P= 0. 002) and power output(P< 0. 001) were observed at the follow-up CPET in the exercise group versus controls {{and there were no}} adverseevents. Although this feasibility study was not powered to detect changes in post-operative recovery outcomes,there were marginal (non-significant) differences in favour of the exercise group in post-operative Clavien-Dindo score and need for High Dependency Unit inotropic support. Conclusions: Vigorous intensity aerobicinterval exercise could be an effective strategy for improving pre-operative physiological reserve and postoperativerecovery outcomes in bladder cancer patients undergoing RC. Implications for Cancer Survivors:Bladder cancer patients respond well to <b>pre-surgical</b> interval <b>exercise</b> and the improvements in cardiopulmonaryfitness variables could have important implications for post-operative recuperation after RC...|$|R

40|$|Background: This thesis {{describes}} a three-year mixed methods study which {{aimed to develop}} and test the feasibility of an exercise intervention {{for people who are}} surgically treated for lung cancer. The study employed the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) as an underpinning theoretical framework in order to focus on the behaviour change components necessary for such kind of intervention. It used an inductive approach to aid the development of the intervention using guidance from the Medical Research Council (MRC) on developing and evaluating complex interventions. Methods: The study was split into two phases with three parts. Phase one part one consisted of a systematic review examining the literature on exercise intervention for people who are surgically treated for lung cancer. Part two comprised a qualitative study examining the attitudes and beliefs of key stakeholders (patients and health professionals) on exercise for the population under study. The results from phase one informed the development of a three week <b>pre-surgical</b> <b>exercise</b> intervention carried out in phase two. Feasibility and acceptability were measured alongside other secondary outcomes to explore the feasibility of implementing the intervention. Results: The results from the review illustrated the infancy of the field under study and provided evidence for the need for further investigation of key stakeholders’ attitudes and beliefs. The qualitative study, which included 23 participants, added to the results from the review and indicated that the design of an exercise intervention for this population should be multifaceted, for example including the option for both supervised centre-based group exercise and home-based exercise such as walking. Fourteen participants were recruited to the three week <b>pre-surgical</b> <b>exercise</b> intervention implemented in phase two. The results concerning feasibility of the intervention designed were mixed. Overall recruitment rate was low (33...|$|E
40|$|Abstract : Optimal {{physical}} activity (PA) interventions {{are needed to}} increase PA in individuals with severe obesity, and optimize the results of bariatric surgery (BS). The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the feasibility and effect of in-home <b>Pre-Surgical</b> <b>Exercise</b> Training delivered via telehealth (TelePreSET) in subjects awaiting BS. Six women following the TelePreSET were compared to the women from a previous study (12 performing the PreSET in a gymnasium and 11 receiving usual care). In-home TelePreSET (12 -weeks of endurance and strength training) was supervised twice weekly using videoconferencing. Physical fitness, quality of life, exercise beliefs, anthropometric measures, and telehealth perception were assessed before and after 12 -weeks. Satisfaction was evaluated with questionnaires at the end of the intervention. The TelePreSET participants attended 96 % of the exercise sessions, and were very satisfied by the TelePreSET. The baseline telehealth perception score was high, and increased significantly after the intervention. The TelePreSET group significantly increased their physical fitness compared to the usual care group. No significant change was noted in other outcomes. The TelePreSET is feasible and seems effective to improve the physical fitness of women awaiting BS. Further studies will confirm beneficial effects of this innovative mode of delivery...|$|E
40|$|The {{advancement}} of perioperative medicine {{is leading to}} greater diversity and creativity for pre-surgical interventions implemented to reduce patient surgical risk and enhance post-surgical recovery. Of these pre-surgical interventions, the prescription of preoperative exercise training is gathering momentum as a realistic means for enhancing patient surgical outcome. Indeed, the general benefits of exercise training {{have the potential to}} preoperatively optimise several pre-surgical risks factors, including cardiorespiratory function, frailty and cognitive function. Any exercise programme incorporated into the preoperative pathway of care needs to be effective and time-efficient, in that substantial fitness gains are possible in the often short period of time between the decision for surgery to operation (e. g. 4 weeks). Fortunately, there is a large volume of research describing effective and time-efficient exercise training programmes within the discipline of sports science. Accordingly, the objective of our commentary is to synthesise contemporary exercise training research, both from non-clinical and clinical populations, with an overarching aim of informing the development of effective and time-efficient <b>pre-surgical</b> <b>exercise</b> training programmes. The development of such exercise training programmes requires the careful consideration of several key principles, namely frequency, intensity, time, type and progression of exercise. Therefore, in light of the gathering evidence demonstrating the effectiveness and time-efficiency of high-intensity interval training - which involves brief bouts of intense exercise interspersed with longer recovery periods - the principles of exercise training programme design will be discussed in the context of high-intensity interval training programmes. Other issues pertinent to the development, implementation and evaluation of preoperative exercise training programmes, such as individual exercise prescription, training session monitoring and potential barriers and risks to high-intensity exercise are also discussed. The evidence presented suggests that individually prescribed and supervised high-intensity interval training programmes, encompassing a variety of exercise modes represent an effective and safe means of exercise therapy prior to surgery...|$|E
