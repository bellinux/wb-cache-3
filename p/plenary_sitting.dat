Later, in {{an address}} to 27 EU leaders, Hans-Gert Poettering declared: [...] "Only last Monday, at its <b>plenary</b> <b>sitting,</b> the European Parliament condemned in the strongest possible terms the appalling murderous attack on a school in Jerusalem and the latest acts of violence perpetrated by Hamas and other Palestinian extremists. The bombardment of Israel from the Gaza Strip must stop. This kind of resistance is terrorism and cannot, therefore, {{be the subject of}} negotiations. At the same time, ignoring the population of Gaza and supplying them with only the barest humanitarian necessities cannot be part of a workable, long-term solution." ...|$|E

This gives well {{qualified}} young people with {{a strong interest in}} politics from the USA and Central, Eastern and South Eastern Europe the opportunity to gain first-hand experience of Germany’s system of parliamentary government. The scheme involves five month placements with Members of the German Bundestag. The participants are introduced to the wide variety of tasks carried out in a Member’s office. For example, they may find themselves drafting speeches, articles and letters or doing preparatory work for <b>plenary</b> <b>sittings.</b> The exchange programmes of the German Bundestag are conceived of as exciting ways of teaching young people about the significance of friendly cooperation based on shared political and cultural values. The scholarship-winners are chosen by the German Bundestag’s independent selection panel.|$|R

However, the role of parliamentary decision making in this area has gradually emerged as a topic for constitutional discussion in the house of commons. The {{decision to go to war}} in Iraq in 2002 − 3 is considered to have been a culmination point for the role of parliament in decision making about the deployment of troops abroad and the use {{of military}} force. In addition to the need for international authorisation, the decision to go to war was preceded by a clear parliamentary preference for a domestic mandate for participation, delivered by means of a vote in the house of commons. This article argues that, as a result of this emphasis on domestic political authorisation, the royal prerogative (the residual powers of the sovereign that are exercised by the ministers of the government) has been subjected to broader discussion in <b>plenary</b> <b>sittings</b> since the Second World War. Furthermore, this constitutional debate continued after the invasion of Iraq had begun and the operations against Iraq's conventional forces had turned into insurgency warfare...|$|R
