We show that maternally expressed VegT controls the pattern of <b>primary</b> <b>germ</b> <b>layer</b> specification in Xenopus embryos. Reduction of the maternal store completely alters the fates of {{different regions of the}} blastula so that animal cell fate is changed from epidermis and nervous system to epidermis only, equatorial cell fate is changed from mesoderm to ectoderm, and vegetal cell fate is changed from endoderm to mesoderm and ectoderm. Vegetal cells lose their capacity both to form endoderm and to release mesoderm-inducing signals. These results show that a single maternally expressed gene controls the patterning of the Xenopus blastula...|$|E
40|$|SummaryHuman {{embryonic}} stem cells (hESCs) rely on fibroblast growth factor and Activin-Nodal signaling to maintain their pluripotency. However, Activin-Nodal signaling is also known to induce mesendoderm differentiation. The mechanisms by which Activin-Nodal signaling can achieve these contradictory functions remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Smad-interacting protein 1 (SIP 1) limits the mesendoderm-inducing effects of Activin-Nodal signaling without inhibiting the pluripotency-maintaining effects exerted by SMAD 2 / 3. In turn, Activin-Nodal signaling cooperates with NANOG, OCT 4, and SOX 2 to control the expression of SIP 1 in hESCs, thereby limiting the neuroectoderm-promoting effects of SIP 1. Similar results were obtained with mouse epiblast stem cells, implying that these mechanisms are evolutionarily conserved and may operate in vivo during mammalian development. Overall, our results reveal the mechanisms by which Activin-Nodal signaling acts through SIP 1 to regulate the cell-fate decision between neuroectoderm and mesendoderm in the progression from pluripotency to <b>primary</b> <b>germ</b> <b>layer</b> differentiation...|$|E

During MZT, maternally supplied mRNAs are degraded while zygotic transcripts are synthesized to either reinforce the already specified cell fate or to trigger new cell identity.

This leads to the impaired ability of the ectodermal progenitors to respond to factors regulating brain patterning and their eventual loss by apoptosis. XSeb 4 R protein binds specifically to the 3 ′UTR of Sox 3 mRNA. XSeb 4 R gain-of-function in ectodermal explants reveals increased stability of the maternal Sox 3 transcripts, associated with a robust Sox 3 protein production.

40|$|Background: The {{evolutionary}} {{origin of}} gastrulation-defined as a morphogenetic event {{that leads to}} the establishment of germ layers-remains a vexing question. Central to this debate is the evolutionary relationship between the cell layers of sponges (poriferans) and eumetazoan germ layers. Despite considerable attention, it remains unclear whether sponge cell layers undergo progressive fate determination akin to eumetazoan <b>primary</b> <b>germ</b> <b>layer</b> formation during gastrulation. Results: Here we show by cell-labelling experiments in the demosponge Amphimedon queenslandica that the cell layers established during embryogenesis have no relationship to the cell layers of the juvenile. In addition, juvenile epithelial cells can transdifferentiate into a range of cell types and move between cell layers. Despite the apparent lack of cell layer and fate determination and stability in this sponge, the transcription factor GATA, a highly conserved eumetazoan endomesodermal marker, is expressed consistently in the inner layer of A. queenslandica larvae and juveniles. Conclusions: Our results are compatible with sponge cell layers not undergoing progressive fate determination and thus not being homologous to eumetazoan germ layers. Nonetheless, the expression of GATA in the sponge inner cell layer suggests a shared ancestry with the eumetazoan endomesoderm, and that the ancestral role of GATA in specifying internalised cells may antedate the origin of germ layers. Together, these results support germ layers and gastrulation evolving early in eumetazoan evolution from pre-existing developmental programs used for the simple patterning of cells in the first multicellular animals...|$|E

40|$|Germ layer {{formation}} and patterning of the embryonic axes {{are two of}} the earliest and most highly conserved processes in vertebrate development. In the frog, Xenopus laevis, <b>primary</b> <b>germ</b> <b>layer</b> specification divides the embryo into three prospective territiories; animal pole ectoderm, marginal zone mesoderm and vegetal pole endoderm. Nodal signals from the vegetal hemisphere of the embryo induce mesoderm in the overlying marginal zone, and contribute to formation of the dorsal organizer, which patterns the dorsal-ventral organization of the germ layers. Nodal expression must be carefully regulated to ensure normal germ layer specification and organizer formation. Here I have used molecular and embryological approaches in Xenopus to describe two novel mechanisms of Nodal transcriptional regulation by Fox family transcription factors. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies have demonstrated that FoxD 3 is sufficient to induce Nodal expression and mesoderm induction, and is required for Nodal expression in the organizer. FoxD 3 activates Nodal through transcriptional repression of Nodal inhibitors. Groucho corepressors physically interact with FoxD 3, and cooperate with FoxD 3 in Nodal activation. A second Fox family protein, Fast 1 /FoxH 1, was previously implicated in the activation of nodal target genes and in Nodal autoregulation. I have found a novel role for Fast 1 in Nodal pathway regulation in which Fast 1 and Groucho corepressors form a complex that represses the transcription of mutiple Nodal genes in the early embryo. Thus, I have identified new roles for both FoxD 3 and Fast 1, and the transcriptional cofactor Groucho, in the regulation of Nodal signaling and mesoderm formation. ...|$|E
40|$|In ecdysozoan protostomes, {{including}} arthropods and nematodes, transcription {{factors of}} the GATA family specify the endoderm: Drosophila dGATAb (ABF/Serpent) and Caenorhabditis elegans END- 1 play {{important roles in}} generating this <b>primary</b> <b>germ</b> <b>layer.</b> end- 1 is the earliest expressed endoderm-specific gene known in C. elegans and appears to initiate the program of gene expression required for endoderm differentiation, including a cascade of GATA factors required for development and maintenance of the intestine. Among vertebrate GATA proteins, the GATA- 4 / 5 / 6 subfamily regulates aspects of late endoderm development, but a role for GATA factors in establishing the endoderm is unknown. We show here that END- 1 binds to the canonical target DNA sequence WGATAR with specificity {{similar to that of}} vertebrate GATA- 1 and GATA- 4, and that it functions as a transcriptional activator. We exploited this activity of END- 1 to demonstrate that establishment of the vertebrate endoderm, like that of invertebrate species, also appears to involve GATA transcriptional activity. Like the known vertebrate endoderm regulators Mixer and Sox 17, END- 1 is a potent activator of endoderm differentiation in isolated Xenopus ectoderm. Moreover, a dominant inhibitory GATA-binding fusion protein abrogates endoderm differentiation in intact embryos. By examining these effects in conjunction with those of Mixer- and Sox 17 β-activating and dominant inhibitory constructs, we further establish the likely relationships between GATA activity and these regulators in early development of the vertebrate endoderm. These results suggest that GATA factors may function sequentially to regulate endoderm differentiation in both protostomes and deuterostomes...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The embryo of the {{crustacean}} Parhyale hawaiensis has a total, unequal and invariant early cleavage pattern. It specifies cell fates {{earlier than}} other arthropods, including Drosophila, as individual blastomeres of the 8 -cell stage are {{allocated to the}} germ layers and the germline. Furthermore, the 8 -cell stage is amenable to embryological manipulations. These unique features make Parhyale a suitable system for elucidating germ layer specification in arthropods. Since asymmetric localization of maternally provided RNA is a widespread mechanism to specify early cell fates, we asked whether this is also true for Parhyale. A candidate gene approach did not find RNAs that are asymmetrically distributed at the 8 -cell stage. Therefore, we designed a high-density microarray from 9400 recently sequenced ESTs (1) to identify maternally provided RNAs and (2) to find RNAs that are differentially distributed among cells of the 8 -cell stage. RESULTS: Maternal-zygotic transition takes place around the 32 -cell stage, i. e. after the specification of germ layers. By comparing a pool of RNAs from early embryos without zygotic transcription to zygotic RNAs of the germband, we {{found that more than}} 10 % of the targets on the array were enriched in the maternal transcript pool. A screen for asymmetrically distributed RNAs at the 8 -cell stage revealed 129 transcripts, from which 50 % are predominantly expressed in the early embryonic stages. Finally, we performed knockdown experiments for two of these genes and observed cell-fate-related defects of embryonic development. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to Drosophila, the four <b>primary</b> <b>germ</b> <b>layer</b> cell lineages in Parhyale are specified during the maternal control phase of the embryo. A key step in this process is the asymmetric distribution {{of a large number of}} maternal RNAs to the germ layer progenitor cells...|$|E

Spemann 2 ̆ 7 s organizer patterns the <b>primary</b> <b>germ</b> <b>layers</b> to establish the anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes. To better understand vertebrate axis formation, I have characterized molecular events that generate the <b>primary</b> <b>germ</b> <b>layers</b> and Spemann 2 ̆ 7 s organizer. I have characterized {{the role of the}} maternal transcription factor VegT and the TGFβ family member Nodal in the regulation of early endodermal and mesodermal gene expression. Also, I have demonstrated the ability of the endoderm-specific transcription factor Sox 17 α to prevent the expression of mesodermal genes in response to Nodal signals. My results suggest that direct regulation of Sox 17 α by VegT establishes the endoderm, distinct from the mesoderm, by preventing the expression of mesodermal genes in response to Nodal signals. Finally, I have characterized the cooperation between vegetal TGFβ signals, known to regulate endoderm and mesoderm formation and Siamois, a Wnt target gene, in generation of the organizer. These data support a model in which the organizer forms in the region of overlap between maternal Wnt signals, localized to the dorsal side of the embryo, and TGFβ signals present in the vegetal hemisphere. While the distinct responses of the three <b>germ</b> <b>layers</b> to the influence of Spemann 2 ̆ 7 s organizer are critical for proper axis formation, my results indicate that establishment of Spemann 2 ̆ 7 s organizer is dependent on the signals that generate the endoderm and mesoderm. ...|$|R

Embryogenesis occurs by unequal cleavage of blastomeres to form a solid blastula consisting micro- and macromeres; multipolar migration of the micromeres {{to the surface of the}} embryo results in a bi-layered embryo and is interpreted as gastrulation. Polarity of the embryo is determined by the movement of pigment-containing micromeres to one pole of the embryo; this pole later becomes the posterior pole of the swimming larva. The bi-layered larva has a fully differentiated monociliated outer cell layer, and a solid interior of various cell types surrounded by dense collagen. The pigmented cells at the posterior pole give rise to long cilia that are capable of responding to environmental stimuli. Larvae settle on their anterior pole. Fluorescent labeling of the monociliated outer cell layer with a cell-lineage marker (CMFDA) demonstrates that the monociliated cells resorb their cilia, migrate inwards, and transdifferentiate into the choanocytes of the juvenile sponge, and into other amoeboid cells. The development of the flagellated choanocytes and other cells in the juvenile from the monociliated outer layer of this sponge 2 ̆ 7 s larva is interpreted as the dedifferentiation of fully differentiated larval cells-a process seen during the metamorphosis of other ciliated invertebrate larvae-not as inversion of the <b>primary</b> <b>germ</b> <b>layers.</b> These results suggest that the sequences of development in this haplosclerid demosponge are not very different than those observed in many cnidarians...|$|R

Nanog in turn prevents neuroectoderm differentiation induced by FGF signalling and limits the transcriptional activity of the Smad 2 / 3 cascade, blocking progression along the endoderm lineage.

To address the function of PTIP in ES cells, we generated ES cell lines from a floxed ptip allele and deleted PTIP function with Cre recombinase. The ptip −/− ES cell lines exhibited a high degree of spontaneous differentiation to trophectoderm and a loss of pluripotency. Reduced levels of Oct 4 expression and H 3 K 4 methylation were observed. Upon differentiation, ptip −/− embryoid bodies showed reduced levels of marker gene expression for all three <b>primary</b> <b>germ</b> <b>layers.</b> These results suggest that the maintenance of H 3 K 4 methylation is essential and requires PTIP function during the in vitro propagation of pluripotent ES cells.

40|$|AbstractAmphibian holoblastic {{cleavage}} {{in which}} all blastomeres contribute {{to any one of}} the three <b>primary</b> <b>germ</b> <b>layers</b> has been widely thought to be a developmental pattern in the stem lineage of vertebrates, and meroblastic cleavage to have evolved independently in each vertebrate lineage. In extant primitive vertebrates, agnathan lamprey and basal bony fishes also undergo holoblastic cleavage, and their vegetal blastomeres have been generally thought to contribute to embryonic endoderm. However, the present marker analyses in basal ray-finned fish bichir and agnathan lamprey embryos indicated that their mesoderm and endoderm develop in the equatorial marginal zone, and their vegetal cell mass is extraembryonic nutritive yolk cells, having non-cell autonomous meso-endoderm inducing activity. Eomesodermin (eomes), but not VegT, orthologs are expressed maternally in these animals, suggesting that VegT is a maternal factor for endoderm differentiation only in amphibian. The study raises the viewpoint that the lamprey/bichir type holoblastic development would have been ancestral to extant vertebrates and retained in their stem lineage; amphibian-type holoblastic development would have been acquired secondarily, accompanied by the exploitation of new molecular machinery such as maternal VegT...|$|R
40|$|Extracellular purines and pyrimidines play {{major roles}} during embryogenesis, organogenesis, {{postnatal}} development and ageing in vertebrates, including humans. Pluripotent stem cells can differentiate into three <b>primary</b> <b>germ</b> <b>layers</b> of the embryo {{but may also}} be involved in plasticity and repair of the adult brain. These cells express the molecular components necessary for purinergic signalling, and their developmental fates can be manipulated via this signalling pathway. Functional P 1, P 2 Y and P 2 X receptor subtypes and ectonucleotidases {{are involved in the}} development of different organ systems, including heart, blood vessels, skeletal muscle, urinary bladder, central and peripheral neurons, retina, inner ear, gut, lung and vas deferens. The importance of purinergic signalling in the ageing process is suggested by changes in expression of A 1 and A 2 receptors in old rat brains and reduction of P 2 X receptor expression in ageing mouse brain. By contrast, in the periphery, increases in expression of P 2 X 3 and P 2 X 4 receptors are seen in bladder and pancreas...|$|R
