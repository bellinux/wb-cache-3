40|$|Abstract The {{refractory}} oxides MgO and Al 2 O 3 are {{the most}} commonly used insulator/filler materials in solid-media pressure assemblies. These oxides react with one another at high temperatures and pressures, forming a well-defined layer of spinel (MgAl 2 O 4) at the contact. The spinel layer widens in proportion to the square root of time at a rate that also depends systematically upon temperature and pressure. On the basis of 44 piston-cylinder runs spanning 1, 200 – 2, 000 C and 1. 0 – 4. 0 GPa, we present a general relationship describing the width (DX) of the spinel layer as a function of time (t, in s), temperature (T, in K) and pressure (P, in GPa) : DX 8 : 58 1011 exp 48865 =T 2 : 08 p 1 = 2 t 1 = 2. If the pressure and duration of an experiment are known (as is usually the case) this calibration makes it possible to calculate the temperature to within a few degrees at any location in a solid-media assembly where MgO and Al 2 O 3 are in contact (at T above 1, 200 C) – simply by measuring the width of the spinel layer with an optical microscope. Application of this ‘‘reaction-progress’’ thermometer to the 13 - and 19 -mm diameter <b>piston-cylinder</b> <b>assemblies</b> used in the RPI lab confirms gener-ally parabolic axial T gradients with acceptably broad hot spots. Three-dimensional maps of the 19 -mm as-sembly reveal a radial component to the thermal field, with somewhat higher temperatures near the graphite heating element (i. e., a saddle-shaped hot region). Two exploratory experiments in a multi-anvil apparatus at 14 GPa (1, 700 and 1, 975 C) confirm that the reaction-progress technique will work at pressures well above 4 GPa. The piston-cylinder-based calibration predicts DX to within a factor of two in the two multi-anvil runs, and relative changes in T along the assembly can be readily mapped. However, additional high-pressure cal-ibration points will be needed before the thermometer can be used in quantitative multi-anvil applications. The spinel reaction-progress thermometer is easily imple-mented, and should allow other researchers to map the thermal structures of their own assemblies in a single experiment with one thermocouple...|$|R

This results in the sample experiencing a pressure lower than expected, given the applied force of the piston. Although the effect is generally compensated for by applying a 'friction' correction, there have been wide variations in the corrections applied {{for some of the}} harder cell materials. We have determined friction correction factors for a range of cell assemblies commonly used in our laboratory relative to select well-characterized phase equilibria. Single-sleeve NaCl cells require, using the piston-in technique, very small corrections of the order - 0. 05 GPa for 12. 7 mm diameter, and less for larger diameter assemblies. Four separate calibrations of the single sleeve 12. 7 mm BaCO 3 cell show that it requires a correction of - 9 %. This factor is entirely independent of temperature and pressure within the range 1000 to 1600 °C and 1. 5 to 3. 2 GPa. This result is in contrast to the results of Fram and Longhi (1992) who claim that the correction for BaCO 3 cells is highly dependent on pressure. For the assemblies included in this study there is an increase in the pressure correction required in the order of 12. 7 mm diameter NaCl-pyrex - 3 %; 19 mm talc-pyrex - 3. 6 %; 12. 7 mm BaCO 3 - 9 % and 12. 7 mm BaCO 3 -silica glass - 13 %...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Washington State UniversityIn this study, work on {{developing}} {{a small scale}} internal combustion engine operating on a four-stroke principle is conducted. To mitigate the parasitic losses, a complaint engine concept is proposed in which the <b>piston-cylinder</b> <b>assembly</b> {{is replaced by a}} flexible cavity. This approach offers various advantages, such as mitigating friction and blow-by losses, fuel-flexibility, and a simpler design. The study encompasses mathematical modeling, feasibility analysis, and testing of a prototype engine. A physics-based lumped-parameter model is developed to predict the engine performance for a range of equivalence ratios at various load conditions in both open and closed cycle operations. The open and closed cycle results showed similarities. For instance, both the cycles showed that for a fixed load, increasing the heat input results in increase of stroke length and efficiency. However, the predictions from the cycles differed numerically in terms of efficiency, operating frequency etc. For example, the indicated thermal efficiencies obtained from open and closed cycles were 38. 4 % and 47. 6 %, respectively. It has been realized that when modeling the compliant engine in a more realistic way, an open cycle would be more appropriate. The open cycle results highlight some unique features of the complaint engine. For instance, the engine volume excursions are found to be dependent on the heat input or equivalence ratio and load condition. To ascertain the feasibility of a practical engine, super compliant structures fabricated from metals and, or composites that can sustain extreme pressures and temperatures are evaluated. In addition, a prototype engine is realized to practically demonstrate the compliant engine concept. The engine is motored to estimate the parasitic losses at resonant operation, and the results are presented {{in the form of an}} energy flow diagram. The results showed that friction losses associated with the flexible cavity are less than that in a <b>piston-cylinder</b> <b>assembly.</b> An example simulation based on open cycle with practical engine parameters showed that the ratio of friction work to indicated work is about 8 %; less than targeted 10 %.

The accurate determination of equilibrium properties needs a homogeneous temperature within the sample and transient experiments often require a defined thermal gradient.

To this end, the temperature distribution within various different <b>piston-cylinder</b> <b>assembly</b> designs was modeled with a specially designed 3 D-Finite-Difference (3 D-FD) program and compared to laboratory observations. For the 3 D-FD simulation, the temperature and pressure dependence of the thermal properties of piston-cylinder-assembly materials (NaCl, CaF 2, pyrophyllite, Au, graphite, NiCr-alloy) was considered. Furthermore, the T-dependent resistivity of graphite was used to model the local heat generation of the graphite heater.

40|$|Lunar petrology, {{most notably}} the absense of hydrous {{minerals}} (such as micas and amphiboles) {{and the lack of}} Fe 2 O 3, imply a low oxygen activity for the Moon. The anhydrous nature of the Moon is consistent with observed depletions in volatile elements compared to the Earth. Recent analytical developments have led to the re-investigation of lunar samples. In volcanic products, heterogeneous water contents in volcanic glass beads olivine-hosted melt inclusions and in the accessory phase apatite indicate a wetter lunar interior than previously thought. Analysis of lunar apatite has produced OH contents as high as 12000 ppm and volatile contents of olivine-hosted melt inclusions appear to be similar to terrestrial mid-ocean ridge basalts values. However, analysis of Cl isotope compositions from a range of lunar rocks (basalts, glasses, apatite grains) identified a Cl fractionation 25 times larger than on Earth. This has been interpreted as reflecting a relatively dry lunar interior. The coupled nature of Cl and H, together with this high fractionation of Cl has been used to suggest the Moon’s mantle has H values as low as 10 ppb. To calculate the volatile contents of lunar melts, the partitioning behaviour of volatiles into apatite must be considered. Very little work has been done on the partition of volatiles under lunar conditions, however to fully constrain the H content of the magmatic source regions based on apatite grain measurements, determination of accurate partition coefficients is required. Experimental work using a <b>piston-cylinder</b> <b>assembly</b> at VU, University Amsterdam, is being carried out to derive these partition coefficients for volatiles (F, OH, Cl) between apatite and melts. Measurements of the volatile contents in experimental synthesised apatites are being carried out using a Cameca NanoSIMS 50 L ion probe at the Open University. Primary experiments have looked at the temperature effect of F partitioning into apatite. This experimental work will be combined with measurements of Cl, F, and OH concentrations as well as Cl and H isotope compositions in mare basalts.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to combine computational flow modelling, flow visualization and point measurements of mean flow and turbulence properties to obtain a better, more detailed, understandýing {{of the effects of}} alternative throttling devices on mixture preparation and turbulence generation in spark ignition engines. In so doing, it also seeks to assess the wider diagnostic potential of flow field computational techniques in internal combustion engine designs. Full-scale models, comprising simplified representations of the induction tract, throttling device, inlet valve and cylinder, have been manufactured in Perspex for steady-state water analogy tests. The resulting photographs of flow tracers in a variety of viewing planes provide a clear, but qualitative, picture of the princi - pal features of the flow in the models under study. The essentially qualitative data obtained from water analogy tests are complemented by limited hot wire velocity measurements at particular stations in the Perspex models, with air replacing the water as the flow medium. These data, supplemented by information in the literature, provide the framework for comparisons with an extensive computational simulation of induction flows which are performed using the general purpose PHOENICS code developed by CHAM. These studies include both transient and steady state predictions. The statistically stationary turbulent flow field through alternative induction system throttling devices -a conventional butterfly valve and a variable geometry ramp restriction- are modelled computationally and compared with water analogy flow visualization. The principal flow field characteristics are satisfactorily reproduced, including in particular the extent of the recirculation zone in the lee of the throttle and the relative persistence of the turbulence generated downstream for varying throat apertures. That generated by the two-dimensional variable geometry ramp is predicted to be both higher and persist beyond the inlet valve into the cylinder producing discernible swirl at high throttle settings. The limited quantitative comparisons with hot wire velocity measurements lend further support to the more detailed aspects of the computational predictions. Finally, comparisons are made between PHOENICS predictions and Laser-Doppler measurements of velocity for transient flow inside an axisymmetric motored <b>piston-cylinder</b> <b>assembly,</b> for different valve seat angles, reported in the literature. The agreement is again very encouraging, reinforcing the view that general purpose computer codes of the kind investigated can {{play an important role in}} detailed design assessment and evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Three bio-butanol fuel {{atomization}} and combustion technologies were considered, namely butanol electrostatic sprays, butanol non-premixed flames, and butanol kinetic modeling {{in view of}} the emergence of methods of production of this fuel from biological sources. Butanol electrospray (e-spray) phenomenology was investigated through high-speed visualization and compared with the corresponding electrosprays of ethanol, heptane and butanol-containing mixtures. Electrospray structure was probed using Phase Doppler Anemometry and both droplet size and velocity measurements were obtained for sprays of butanol and butanol-containing fuel blends. These results indicated an unstable and polydisperse electrospray behavior for most conditions. Several factors were identified as responsible for this unstable behavior and were investigated experimentally. These included: e-spray menisci oscillations, instabilities initiating the droplet break-up, secondary droplet break-up because of high Weber numbers and finally stability of butanol electrical conductivity with applied voltage. Stable butanol electrosprays were achieved within a narrow region of low flow rates and a non-dimensional analysis was performed in order to develop an empirical expression correlating the dimensionless average diameter, flow rate and applied voltage. Butanol non-premixed flames were studied in a counter-flow burner configuration. Major combustion species were measured using line Raman imaging and K-type thermocouples were used in order to perform temperature scans across the flame. Also, extinction strain rates were measured as a function of overall stoichiometry. Butanol flames were compared with flames of methane (which is not oxygenated) as well as ethanol which is a currently widely employed biofuel and with butanol-methane mixture flames. It was shown that butanol flames could sustain higher strain rates at extinction than ethanol flames but significantly smaller than methane flames. For the strongly diluted flames under consideration, it was shown that temperature followed a very closely linear relation with nitrogen concentration. For the same nitrogen concentration, butanol exhibited lower temperatures at the same overall stoichiometry and heat release, because of the higher average molecular weight of the fuel stream. In addition, the possibility of estimating the scalar dissipation rate at the stoichiometric surface χstoich was investigated through a measurement of the mixing layer thickness. It was proven that approximating the mixing layer thickness through the gradient of the mixture fraction at the stoichiometric surface, offered a good estimation of χstoich. Butanol kinetic modeling was studied in a zero-dimensional <b>piston-cylinder</b> <b>assembly</b> and a MATLAB code was used in order to solve the energy conservation and species equations. Pressure and temperature results were provided as a function of time, along with mol fractions of major species and combustion intermediates. The same calculation was performed for ethanol and n-heptane. It was shown that butanol peak pressures and temperatures were lower than the corresponding values for the other two fuels and that its autoignition occurred after a longer time interval...|$|E
40|$|Turbulent {{swirling}} and tumbling flow currents are dominating {{phenomena in}} {{the internal combustion engine}} systems. These occurrences have great influence on the quality of fuel-air mixture and combustion. Concerning the employment of the CFD (Computation Fluid Dynamics) methods for relevant flow simulations, the LES (Large Eddy Simulation) method {{is becoming more and more}} the computational tool in the field of engine design and optimization, thanks to its predictive capability to better estimate the rotational characteristics and cycle-to-cycle variations. This method com- pensates the disadvantages of classical RANS (Reynolds Averaging Navier- Stokes) models of turbulence by resolving the instantaneous flow structures. However, it is accompanied by uncertainties concerning the required mesh resolution. The hybrid eddy-resolving methods, which gain increased popularity in the CFD community, are conceptualized to combine the advantageous characteristics of RANS and LES. This leads to an advanced modeling strategy for complex flow configurations at higher Reynolds numbers. On one hand, the large flow structure is captured in accordance with the applied grid spacing; furthermore, the small structures are computed by an appropriately modified RANS model of turbulence. In the present work, an eddy-resolving model, denoted as ”Very Large Eddy Simulation” (VLES) according to Speziale (1998), is formulated and validated. The validations are preliminary carried out by computing some important generic configurations as decay of homogeneous isotropic turbulence (Tavoularis et al. (1997); underlying the basic turbulence law concerning its natural decay), plane channel flow (Moser et al. (1999); most important representative of wall-bounded flow configurations for studying the near-wall turbulence) and flow over a periodical arrangement of two-dimensional hills (Temmermann et al. (2003); separation at a curved continuous surface) to check the model’s predictive capabilities. Furthermore, a real three-dimensional swirling flow in a vortex tube with different shapes of outlet orifices (investigated experimentally by Grundmann et al., 2012) and a generic <b>piston-cylinder</b> <b>assembly</b> focusing on the compression of a tumbling vortex generated during the intake phase (experiment by Borèe et al., 2001) were computed to examine whether the relevant flow properties can be correctly captured computationally. Finally, an industrial engine system (not accounting for the spray and combustion) for which the experimental reference is provided by Baum et al. (2013) is considered for the final validation to see the suitability of the turbulence models formulated presently for the application in internal combustion engines. Compared to both the Partially Averaged Navier-Stokes (PANS) and RANS methods (the four-equation k-ζ-f model of Hanjalić et al., 2004, was used as the RANS constituent in the present hybrid scheme; in addition the pure LES and RANS computations, the latter employing the same model as the PANS and VLES, have been performed), the present eddy-resolving model exhibits better reproduction of the corresponding reference data. The VLES, which suppresses the modeled turbulent properties to the level of subgrid-scale explicitly by appropriately modifying the turbulent viscosity model, is especially capable of triggering the fluctuation in the entire flow region, whereas PANS shows a too diffusive representation. These features enable the calculation to preserve the LES operating mode in the configurations where the employment of a RANS model is not satisfactory. Furthermore, the VLES method utilizes the currently computed (instantaneous) values without having to extract the averaged properties. This also avoids the problem the PANS method has in the time-dependent calculation of flows with moving boundaries...|$|E
