5000|$|Charcuterie is {{the branch}} of cooking devoted to <b>prepared</b> <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> such as bacon, ham, sausage, terrines, galantines, pâtés, and confit, {{primarily}} from pork. Originally intended {{as a way to}} preserve meats before the advent of refrigeration, these preparations are prepared today for the flavours that are derived from the preservation processes. In 15th century France, local guilds regulated tradesmen in the food production industry in each city. The guilds that produced charcuterie were those of the charcutiers. The members of this guild produced a traditional range of cooked or salted and dried meats, which varied, sometimes distinctively, from region to region. The only [...] "raw" [...] meat the charcutiers were allowed to sell was unrendered lard. The charcutier prepared numerous items, including pâtés, rillettes, sausages, bacon, trotters, and head cheese.|$|R

For instance, for projects 2 (2006) and 10 (2011), both in the turkey industry, investment for the latter project is greater at 29 % (Table[*] 2), though production volume is lower (23 %) and the additional cost of the <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> <b>plant</b> (Table[*] 3) accounts for only 4 % of the total investment.

40|$|Cooked <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> {{are often}} post-contaminated {{because of a}} {{packaging}} and/or slicing step after the pasteurisation process. The shelf life is therefore limited and can be extended by adding Na-lactate. A previously developed model for the spoilage of gas packed cooked <b>meat</b> <b>products,</b> including temperature, water activity and dissolved CO 2 as independent variables, was extended with a fourth factor: the Na-lactate concentration in the aqueous phase of the <b>meat</b> <b>product.</b> Models were developed for the maximum specific growth rate mu(max) and the lag phase lambda of the specific spoilage organism Lactobacillus sake subsp. carnosum. Quadratic response surface equations were compared with extended Ratkowsky models. In general, response surface equations fitted the experimental data best {{but in the case}} of mu(max), the response surface model predicted illogical growth behaviour at low water activities and high Na-lactate concentrations. A extensive product validation of the mathematical models was performed by means of inoculated as well as naturally contaminated industrially <b>prepared</b> cooked <b>meat</b> <b>products.</b> The deviations of the experimentally determined versus predicted growth parameters in inoculated cooked <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> were in general small. Both types of models were also able to predict the shelf life of naturally contaminated cooked <b>meat</b> <b>products,</b> except for pate where an under-estimation of the shelf life was predicted by the response surface equations.

40|$|Resistance to cephalosprins {{due to the}} {{production}} of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) or plasmid mediated AmpC beta-lactamases is increasingly found in infections in humans outside the hospital. The genes encoding for these beta-lactamases are located on mobile DNA (plasmids), which can be transferred between bacterial species. Although the source of these bacteria is unknown, a food-borne source cannot be excluded. From 2003 to 2007 cefotaxime resistance increases in bacteria from broilers, but not in isolates from calves, pigs and dairy cows. Cefotaxime resistance is indicative for the presence of ESBLs or plasmid mediated AmpC beta-lactamases. Molecular typing of the resistance genes and the plasmids of Escherichia coli and Salmonella isolates from broilers revealed the presence of a variety of ESBL/AmpC genes: blaCTX-M- 1, blaCTX-M- 2, blaTEM- 52, blaSHV- 2, blaTEM 20, blaACC- 1 and blaCMY- 2, located on plasmids: IncI 1, IncHI 2 /P, IncK and some untypeable plasmids. A study performed at 26 broiler farms and a study performed in the broiler production pyramid showed that ESBL/AmpC-producing isolates were ubiquitous present. All 26 broiler farms contained broilers with ESBL-producing Escherichia coli in their faeces. Also in faeces of broiler farmers ESBL/AmpC producers were frequently found (33 % against 10 % described in the general population). ESBL/AmpC-producing isolates were also present at every level in the broiler production pyramid. In addition, in a study on three broiler farms, ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli were found in the environment of two of four poultry houses before arrival of the broilers at the broiler farm. At arrival, not all broilers carried ESBL/AmpC-producing isolates, but within one week these isolates could be cultured from faeces of all 25 broilers tested. blaCTX-M- 1 and blaTEM- 52 on IncI 1 plasmids were also found in bacteria isolated from infections in Dutch patients and subtyping of IncI 1 plasmids revealed that 19 % of the E. coli infections in Dutch patients was due to genetically identical resistance genes and plasmids as found in the broiler isolates. In addition, 94 % of broiler meat purchased at different stores in the Netherlands contained similar ESBL-producing bacteria. This shows a high potency of transfer via food to humans. ESBL/AmpC-producing isolates were also found among 2 % of bacteria causing clinical infections in companion animals and horses. ESBL/AmpC genes found in these isolates are partly similar to the ones found in broilers, but also include types found more often in humans, which shows another possible route of these bacteria to humans. Due to the potential threat to human health it is important to control the spread of ESBL/AmpC-producing isolates in the broiler production pyramid. This is feasible by preventing transmission from the top {{to the bottom of the}} broiler production pyramid, by identifying risk factors leading to the presence of ESBL/AmpC-producing isolates, by reducing the selection pressure imposed by the use of antimicrobials and by preventing local recirculation within subsequent flocks. In the meantime hygienic measures at slaughterhouses, hygienic standards in <b>preparing</b> <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> at retail and hygienic measures taken in the kitchen by the consumer are important measures to reduce the possibility of obtaining these isolate...|$|R

A high prevalence (40 %) of L. monocytogenes {{was found in}} cold-smoked <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> compared with other heat-treated ready-to-eat <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> (0. 7 %) available in retail markets in Latvia. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and serotyping were applied to analyse the diversity of L. monocytogenes isolates present in ready-to-eat (RTE) <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> and meat-processing <b>plants.</b> A high genetic diversity was seen among L. monocytogenes isolates from cold-smoked <b>meat</b> <b>products,</b> suggesting the existence of various sources of contamination at different production stages in the meat-processing environment. The manufacture of cold-smoked <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> involves no processing steps to eliminate L. monocytogenes, thus, contamination of the raw meat and contamination during processing can both contribute to L. monocytogenes in the finished product. Logistic multivariable regression model was successfully applied to identify the main factors associated with L. monocytogenes contamination during the manufacturing of cold-smoked pork <b>products.</b> <b>Meat</b> brining by injections was a significant factor (odds ratio 10. 66; P< 0. 05) for contamination of products with L. monocytogenes. Of the cold-smoked meat-processing plant environmental samples, most contaminated sites were associated with brining machine and brining area. Long cold-smoking times (≥ 12 h) also had a significant predictive value (odds ratio 24. 38; P< 0. 014) for a sample testing positive for L. monocytogenes. A genetically diverse population of L. monocytogenes entered the meat-processing plant, where {{only some of the}} strains colonized and established a persistent microbial community within the plant over a 5 -year period. L. monocytogenes PFGE types belonging to serotypes 1 / 2 a and 4 b were isolated from imported, defrosted, raw pork from Germany and Belgium in meat-processing plant B. In total, two L. monocytogenes PFGE types originating from raw meat were found also in finished RTE cold-smoked pork products, whereas one PFGE type was recovered later only from the meat-processing environment. One of the L. monocytogenes PFGE types, belonging to serotype 1 / 2 c, was isolated from RTE cold-smoked <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> and from the feeding teeth of the brining machine, thus showing that improper cleaning, disinfection and poor hygiene design of the brining machine may cause L. monocytogenes contamination over time. Post-package pasteurization of high- and low-fat content cooked sausages at temperatures higher than 55 °C was found to be an effective method of post-process thermal treatment to reduce contamination of L. monocytogenes. However, heating to 55 °C, 60 °C and 62. 5 °C may not be practical in the meat industry because the process takes too long to reach a 3 -log reduction. The formulation of high-fat content RTE cooked sausages may require modification to maintain product quality. During the 10 -year study period the overall incidence of listeriosis in Latvia was 0. 4 per 100 000 population, with the highest incidences recorded in 2000 and 2002 (1. 5 and 0. 7 per 100 000 population, respectively). The highest incidence of listeriosis in Latvia was observed in 2000, which significantly exceeded incidence levels in all Baltic and Nordic countries, and was the highest among all EU member states during the same period. A marked clustering of human listeriosis cases was observed from September to December 2000, possibly indicating one large outbreak. The lack of serotyping and molecular typing methods for subtyping of L. monocytogenes isolates in the present surveillance system {{is one of the main}} reasons why there have been no officially documented listeriosis outbreaks in Latvia to date. Measures to allow the application of appropriate actions at the food industry level need to be implemented to prevent or significantly reduce the real burden of foodborne listeriosis in Latvia. Listeria monocytogenes on elintarvikeperäinen patogeeni, joka voi aiheuttaa listerioosin ihmisille ja eläimille. Listerioosi on suhteellisen harvinainen, mutta vakava tauti, johon sairastuvat yleensä syntymättömät lapset, vanhukset ja vastustuskyvyltään heikentyneet henkilöt. Listerioosille on ominaista korkea kuolleisuus (20 - 30 %) ja se on yksi eniten kuolemia aiheuttavista elintarvikeperäisistä taudeista kehittyneissä maissa. Listeria monocytogeneksen esiintyvyyttä, kulkeutumista ja lämmönsietoa tutkittiin lihatuotteissa ja lihanjalostuslaitoksissa. Lisäksi tutkittiin listerioosi-tapausten kehityssuuntaa Latviassa kymmenen vuoden aikana 1998 - 2007. Latviassa vähittäismyynnissä olevissa kylmäsavustetuissa lihatuotteista todettiin korkea L. monocytogeneksen esiintyvyys (40 %) verrattuna muihin lämpökäsiteltyihin sellaisenaan syötäviin lihatuotteisiin (0, 7 %). Kylmäsavustetuista lihatuotteista eristettiin geneettisesti vaihtelevia L. monocytogenes kantoja, mikä viittaa saastumiseen useista lähteistä tuotannon eri vaiheissa. Listerioosi on Latviassa ilmoitettava tartuntatauti, mutta elintarvikkeista ja kliinisistä näytteistä eristettyjä L. monocytogeneksia ei säännöllisesti kerätä ja tyypitetä. Tämä rajoittaa listerioosi-epidemioiden tunnistamista ja viivyttää tarkoituksenmukaisten toimenpiteiden aloittamista elintarviketuotannossa, jotta voitaisiin estää tai huomattavasti vähentää listerioosi-tapauksia...|$|R
