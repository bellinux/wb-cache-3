40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the feasi-bility and safety of vena cava filter (VCF) placement via percutaneous puncture of the great saphenous vein (GSV) in the prevention of pulmonary embolisms. Using ultrasound positioning, VCF placement via percutaneous puncture of the GSV was performed on 12 patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremities. Transcatheter thrombolysis was conducted simultaneously. The postoperative filter posi-tion, puncture wound recovery and fluency of the GSV were observed. All filters were successfully released, with accurate positioning. No hematoma was observed at the <b>puncture</b> <b>point</b> during the perioperative period. In certain patients, local petechiae appeared around the <b>puncture</b> <b>point</b> during the thrombolysis period, which did not require special treatment.

40|$|This is {{a report}} of blood access <b>puncture</b> <b>point</b> pseudoaneurysms which {{occurred}} in two hemodialysis patients. Case 1 : A 58 -year-old male had been undergoing hemodialysis treatment since June, 1975. In January, 1981 a subcutaneous mass had developed at the blood access <b>puncture</b> <b>point</b> above the previously superficialized left femoral artery. An operation was performed in February, 1981 and the mass was dissected. The same artery has been used since the operation for blood access without any problems. The dimensions of the egg-shaped dissected mass were 3. 5 X 4 X 2. 5 cm. A histological diagnosis of {{the wall of the}} mass showed that it was a pseudoaneurysm. Case 2 : A 48 -year-old female had been undergoing hemodialysis treatment since September, 1983. The left basilic vein, connected to the brachial artery, has been used for blood access. In April, 1984, a subcutaneous mass had developed at the blood access <b>puncture</b> <b>point</b> and an operation was performed within a few days. Operative findings revealed that the mass was a capsulized infected hematoma with a smooth but extremely thin and easily ruptured surface, and the section of the basilic vein surrounded by the mass showed evidence of necrotic change due to compression. The brachial artery was resutured at the region where it was previously connected to the basilic vein without disturbance of arterial blood flow. In July, 1985, an operation was performed in which a new blood access was constructed in the left thigh by superficializing the femoral artery and connecting its side {{to the end of the}} saphenous vein.

40|$|Percutaneous {{liver biopsy}} is the gold {{standard}} among clinician 2 ̆ 7 s tool to diagnose and guide subsequent therapy for liver disease. Ultrasound image guidance is being increasingly used to reduce associated procedural risks but post–biopsy complications still persist. The major and most common complication is hemorrhage, which is highly unpredictable and may sometimes lead to death. Though the risk of mortality is low, it is too high for a diagnostic procedure. Post-biopsy care and additional surgical intervention to arrest hemorrhage make liver biopsy a costly procedure for health care delivery systems. Non-invasive methods to stop bleeding exist like electro–cautery, microwave, lasers, radio frequency, argon–beam, and High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU). All the methods except HIFU require direct exposure of the needle puncture site for hemostasis. HIFU is an ultrasound modality and uses mechanical sound waves for focused energy delivery. Ultrasound waves are minimally affected by tissue attenuation and focus internal targets without direct exposure. Human error in focusing HIFU renders it unusable for a medical procedure especially when noninvasive. In this project we designed and developed an ultrasound guided prototype robot for accurate HIFU targeting to induce hemostasis. The robotic system performs percutaneous needle biopsy and a 7. 5 cm focal length HIFU is fired at the <b>puncture</b> <b>point</b> when the needle tip retracts to the liver surface after sample collection. The robot has 4 degrees of freedom (DOF) for biopsy needle insertion, HIFU positioning, needle angle alignment and US probe image plane orientation. As the needle <b>puncture</b> <b>point</b> is always in the needle path, mechanically constraining the HIFU {{to focus on the}} needle reduced the required functionality significantly. Two mini c-arms are designed for needle angle alignment and US probe image plane orientation. This reduced the contact foot print of the robot over the patient providing a greater dexterity for positioning the robot. The robot is validated for HIFU hemostasis by a series of experiments on chicken breasts. HIFU initiated hemorrhage control with robotic biopsy ensures arrest of post-biopsy hemorrhage and decreases patient anxiety, hospital stay, morbidity, time of procedure, and cost. This can also be extended to other organs like kidneys, lungs etc. and has widespread implications such as control of hemorrhage in post-biopsies in patients with reduced ability for hemostasis. This research opens a greater scope for research for automation and design making it a physician friendly tool for eventual clinical use...|$|E
40|$|Radiofrequency {{ablation}} (RFA) is {{a crucial}} alternative treatment for liver cancer with the advantages of minimal invasion and a fast prognosis.

The optical surgery navigation system in the RFA presents a promising approach for solving the localization problem in the puncturing process, which greatly increases puncture accuracy and has overcome the disadvantages of traditional RFA surgery. In addition, the use of multiple electrodes in the RFA (multi-probe RFA) is proposed and is applied clinically to deal with large tumors. In this study, we present a multi-probe RFA model using the finite element method (FEM) combined with a self-developed optical surgical navigation system.

The retrieved material was stained by May-Grünwald-Giemsa stain. Results. Among 12 patients were 10 men (83 %). We confirmed 4 lung cancers (33 %), 2 mediastinal tumors (16 %), 4 benign lesions of lungs (33 %), 1 benign lesion of mediastinum (8 %) and 1 undetermined lung lesion (8 %). The sensitivity of CT-guided TNB of lungs and mediastinum was estimated 84. 6 %. The procedures were complicated with 4 pneumothoraces (31 %).
