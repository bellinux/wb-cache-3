30|$|In this work, the {{suspension}} properties for a rapid transit rail vehicle are characterized with multi-body dynamic model of 31 {{degrees of freedom}} (dof). The model accounts for all suspension elements and their degrees of freedom of a rapid transit vehicle. The lateral acceleration is used as the measure for the passenger ride comfort throughout this work. Lateral viscous dampers at <b>primary</b> <b>suspensions</b> and the longitudinal anti-yaw dampers at secondary suspension had negligible effect on the passenger ride quality, and hence, these two suspension elements are neglected in the final model. The remaining secondary lateral suspension properties are estimated by varying {{the suspension}} parameters while keeping the remaining other parameters the same and by simulating of responses of lateral stroke and lateral acceleration of the car body. Finally, the selected suspension parameters are checked against stability {{with the use of}} a 3 D multi-body dynamic model and the acceleration response of a rapid transit vehicle is obtained for the optimized suspension properties.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a model-based strategy for condition monitoring of suspensions in a railway bogie. This approach {{is based on}} recursive least-square (RLS) algorithm focusing on the ‘Input-output’ model.

The identification of the suspension parameter is achieved by establishing the relationship between the excitation and response of a bogie. A fault detection method for vertical <b>primary</b> <b>suspensions</b> of one bogie is illustrated as an example of this scheme. Numerical simulation results from the rail vehicle dynamics software ‘ADTreS’ are utilized as ‘virtual measurements’, considering a trailed car of Italian ETR 500 high-speed train. The test data from an E 464 locomotive are also employed to validate the feasibility of this strategy for the real situation. Results of the parameter identification performed indicate that estimated suspension parameters are consistent or approximate with the values for reference, thereby supporting the application of this fault diagnosis technique to the future condition monitoring system of the rail vehicle suspensio...|$|R

40|$|Magnetorheological (MR) fluids {{provide an}} elegant means to enhance {{vibration}} control in <b>primary</b> vehicle <b>suspensions.</b> Such fluids can rapidly modify their flow characteristics {{in response to}} a magnetic field, so they can be used to create semi-active dampers. However, the behaviour of MR dampers is inherently non-linear and as a consequence, the choice of an effective control strategy remains an unresolved problem. Previous research has developed a method to linearize the damper's force/velocity response, to allow implementation of classical control techniques. In the present study, this strategy is used to implement skyhook damping laws within <b>primary</b> automotive <b>suspensions.</b> To simulate the vehicle suspension, a two-degree-of-freedom quarter car model is used, which is excited by realistic road profiles. The controller performance is investigated experimentally using the hardware-in-the-loop-simulation (HILS) method. This experimental method is described in detail and its performance is validated against numerical simulations for a simplified problem. The present authors demonstrate that feedback linearization can provide significant performance enhancements in terms of passenger comfort, road holding, and suspension working space compared with other control strategies. Furthermore, feedback linearization is shown to desensitize the controller to uncertainties in the input excitation such as changes in severity of the road surface roughness...|$|R
