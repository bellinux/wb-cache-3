25|$|In {{order to}} avoid {{over-fertilization}} issues, such as nitrogen burn, vermicompost can be diluted as a tea 50:50 with water, or as a solid can be mixed in 50:50 with <b>potting</b> <b>soil.</b>|$|E
25|$|Seeds grow well in {{a compost}} or <b>potting</b> <b>soil</b> mix – even as a potted indoor plant. Pitaya cacti usually {{germinate}} after between 11 and 14 days after shallow planting. As they are cacti, overwatering is a concern for home growers. As their growth continues, these climbing plants will find something to climb on, which can involve putting aerial roots down from the branches {{in addition to the}} basal roots. Once the plant reaches a mature 10 pounds in weight, the plant may flower.|$|E
25|$|The avocado tree can {{be grown}} {{domestically}} and used as a (decorative) houseplant. The pit germinates in normal soil conditions or partially submerged in a small glass (or container) of water. In the latter method, the pit sprouts in four to six weeks, at which time it is planted in standard houseplant <b>potting</b> <b>soil.</b> The plant normally grows {{large enough to be}} prunable; it does not bear fruit unless it has ample sunlight. Home gardeners can graft a branch from a fruit-bearing plant to speed maturity, which typically takes four to six years to bear fruit.|$|E
30|$|The {{fermented}} COME {{was applied}} to the soil after 20  days of fermentation at the rates of 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200  g per 5 -kg soil (with the first-mentioned rate serving as control). These five treatments were replicated four times, giving a total of 20 <b>potted</b> <b>soils</b> arranged in a Completely Randomized Design (CRD), whereby the <b>potted</b> <b>soils</b> were staggered irrespective of treatment and replication.

25|$|Pontiac fever {{was named}} for Pontiac, Michigan, where the first case was recognized. In 1968, several workers at the county's {{department}} of health came down with a fever and mild flu symptoms, but not pneumonia. After the 1976 Legionnaires' outbreak in Philadelphia, the Michigan health department re-examined blood samples and discovered the workers had been infected with the newly identified Legionella pneumophila. An outbreak caused by Legionella micdadei in early 1988 in the UK became known as Lochgoilhead fever. Since that time, other species of Legionella that cause Pontiac fever have been identified, most notably in New Zealand, in 2007 where Legionella longbeachae was discovered. The New Zealand outbreak also {{marked the first time}} Pontiac fever had been traced to <b>potting</b> <b>soil.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Sweden, farmers use dried peat {{to absorb}} {{excrement}} from cattle that are wintered indoors. The most important property of peat is retaining moisture in container soil {{when it is}} dry while preventing the excess of water from killing roots when it is wet. Peat can store nutrients {{although it is not}} fertile itself– it is polyelectrolytic with a high ion-exchange capacity due to its oxidized lignin. Peat is discouraged as a soil amendment by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, England, since 2003. While bark-based peat-free <b>potting</b> <b>soil</b> mixes are on the rise, particularly in the U.K., peat remains an important raw material for horticulture in Canada, as well as parts of the United States. However, it is recommended to treat peat thermally, e.g., through soil steaming in order to kill pests and reactivate nutrients.|$|E

[...] Bare-root bulbs do best planted in a pot only slightly larger than the circumference of the bulb in well-drained, organic mix (such as sterilized <b>potting</b> <b>soil</b> plus coir fiber, or equal amounts of peat moss, sand and humus), with one third of the bulb visible above the surface of the soil and two thirds buried.|$|E

40|$|Weeds {{can act as}} {{reservoir}} {{hosts of}} a range of pests and diseases. Information and knowledge on the host status of weeds to common pests and diseases can be used to develop integrated weed and pest management strategies. As part of a survey on the distribution and diversity of root-knot nematodes on crops in Fiji, the root-knot nematode host status of weeds was also studied. Weeds growing in root-knot nematode infested farms (n  =  189) and bioassay <b>pot</b> <b>soil</b> samples (n  =  277) were identified, and their host status was determined {{on the basis of a}} root gall and egg-mass index scale from 0 to 5. A total of 45 weed species were recorded as potential weed hosts of root-knot nematodes with a gall index from 1 to 5. Using the weed and tomato bioassay method, a total of 11 nonhost weed species were recorded with a gall index of 0, relative to infected tomato growing in <b>pot</b> <b>soil</b> samples. Common weeds infected by root-knot nematodes on farms and in bioassay <b>pot</b> <b>soil</b> included slender amaranth, old world diamond-flower, tropic ageratum, sicklepod, mimbra, balsamapple, purple bushbean, little ironweed, ivy gourd, and cutleaf groundcherry. The presence of egg masses on the weed hosts indicated their ability to sustain root-knot nematode populations and, thus, their potential to act as reservoir hosts...|$|R

30|$|The above poor {{performance}} of spinach in COME-amended <b>potted</b> <b>soils</b> started from emergence; while it took seeds sown {{in the control}} only 4  days to emerge, it took those in <b>potted</b> <b>soils</b> amended with 50 and 100  g of the effluent over 6  days to emerge, {{and there was no}} emergence at all where higher rates were applied. Similar results for palm oil-mill effluent were reported by Kittikun et al. (2000) and Osaigbovo and Orhue (2011) who attributed their observation to the oily nature of the effluent. The oily nature of the fermented COME might have impaired aeration of the soil which led to poor germination and performance of spinach. In addition, with a C/N ratio of approximately nine resulting to the release of excess nitrogen, the subsequent release of excessive ammonia may have impeded germination and the development of seedlings.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Phospho-gypsum, {{a primary}} waste {{by-product}} in phosphate fertilizer manufacturing industry {{and a potential}} source of electron acceptors, such as mainly of sulfate and a trace amount of iron and manganese oxides, was selected as soil amendment for reducing methane (CH 4) emissions during rice cultiva-tion.

CH 4 flux from the <b>potted</b> <b>soil</b> with rice plant was measured along with soil Eh and floodwater pH during the rice cultivation period. CH 4 emission rates measured by closed chamber method decreased with increasing levels of phospho-gypsum application, but rice yield markedly increased up to 10 Mg ha- 1 of the amendment. At this amendment level, total CH 4 emissions were reduced by 24 % along with 15 % rice grain yield increment over the control. The decrease in total CH 4 emission may be attributed due to shifting of electron flow from methanogenesis to sulfate reduction under anaerobic soil conditions...|$|R
40|$|Bioremediated {{soils are}} usually {{disposed}} of after meeting legislated guidelines defined by chemical and ecotoxicity tests. In many countries including Australia, ecotoxicity tests {{are not yet}} mandatory safety requirements. This study investigated the biotreatment of weathered hydrocarbon-contaminated soils in 12 -week laboratory-based microcosms. Monitored natural attenuation resulted in ? 43 % reduction of total petroleum hydrocarbon contaminant to 5503 mg/kg (C 16 C 35), making the soil suitable for disposal as waste under current guidelines (pesticide and metal contents within safe limits). 16 S rDNA (universal and AlkB) and ITS-based DGGE fingerprints showed stable and adapted microbial communities throughout the experimental period. However, ecotoxicology assays showed 100 % mortality of earthworms (Eisena fetida) in <b>potting</b> <b>soils</b> containing < 50 % (< 2751 mg/kg, legally safe in situ concentrations) contaminated soil over 14 days. Up to 70 % reduction in radish (Raphanus sativus) seed germination was observed in <b>potting</b> <b>soils</b> containing < 10 % contaminated soil (< 550 mg/kg, legally safe ex situ concentrations for soil disposal into residential areas).
