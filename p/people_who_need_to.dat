25|$|Several obituaries {{describe}} Liberati's professional experience, {{highlighting the}} main features of his work and the ideas he supported. He believed that within a health system, research should {{be an integral part}} of its mission, especially where lack of commercial interests prevents the possibility of private investment, and that researchers should concentrate on what is relevant to patients, not to their careers or to drug companies. Moreover, he strongly believed that developing alliances with consumers is necessary for setting research priorities, and that research results should be easily accessible to <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> make decisions about their own health.|$|E
500|$|The modern ao dai {{turned up}} several years ago. However, the ao dai {{was a concern}} of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> wear it as a uniform such as: teacher, flight attendance, receptionists. It {{was not until the}} end of the year 2016 did the modern ao dai become so popular with {{hundreds}} of new designs. It is modified in the collar, the sleeves or the length of two flaps. Furthermore, instead of wearing pants with the ao dai, people nowadays prefer to wear culottes and skirts inside it. Not only the change in designs, people also use different materials for the modern ao dai like silk, brocade fabric or voile fabric.|$|E
50|$|Another {{theme is}} that society is {{influenced}} heavily by ignorance, jealousy and fear. Lawrence {{saw himself as}} a liberator for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> enjoy and experience life without fear or shame.|$|R
50|$|Przhevalsky {{not only}} disdained Chinese ethnic groups, he also viewed the eight million non-Chinese peoples of Tibet, Turkestan, and Mongolia as uncivilized, {{evolutionarily}} backwards <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be freed from Chinese rule. Przhevalsky reportedly killed {{a number of}} Tibetan nomads.|$|R
500|$|The Conservative Party leader David Cameron {{said that}} Choudary [...] "is {{one of those}} <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be looked at seriously {{in terms of the}} {{legality}} of what he's saying because he strays, I think, extremely close to the line of encouraging hatred, extremism and violence." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{response}} to the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, Cardin questioned the legality of military style assault weapons stating that [...] "in my observations in Maryland, I don't know too many <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> have that type of weapon {{in order to do}} hunting in my state or to keep themselves safe." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blue light, principally around 460 to 480nm, {{suppresses}} melatonin, {{proportional to}} the light intensity and length of exposure. Until recent history, humans in temperate climates were exposed to few hours of (blue) daylight in the winter; their fires gave predominantly yellow light. The incandescent light bulb widely used in the 20th century produced relatively little blue light. [...] Light containing only wavelengths greater than 530nm does not suppress melatonin in bright-light conditions. Wearing glasses that block blue light in the hours before bedtime may decrease melatonin loss. Use of blue-blocking goggles the last hours before bedtime has also been advised for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> adjust to an earlier bedtime, as melatonin promotes sleepiness.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Anderson {{participated in}} the SBS doco-reality show Go Back To Where You Came From, in which six Australians, each with differing {{opinions}} on Australia's asylum seeker debate, were taken on a journey to which refugees have taken to reach Australia. At {{the outset of the}} series Anderson says that [...] "boat people" [...] who arrive in Australia illegally should be sent back to their countries of origin: [...] "If you come here illegally, I don't care about your story, first thing you do is you turn around and go back." [...] Later in the series, after having met with refugees from Afghanistan who settled in Melbourne as well as visiting war-torn Kabul, Anderson softened his stand on the subject: [...] "Now I've been here and spoken to people, I don't want to turn away refugees, I don't want to turn away <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be reunited with their families. I don't want that. Who would want that? [...] I don't want people to go on suffering needlessly, when we can give them somewhere safe to be. But I don't want them to come to Australia in boats." ...|$|E
50|$|Legally, Sweden {{is an open}} society. The Principle of Public Access {{says that}} all {{information}} kept by public authorities must be available for anyone except in certain cases. Specifically, anyone's address, income, taxes etc. are available to anyone. This makes fraud easier (the address is restricted only for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> hide).|$|R
50|$|Pottery {{was used}} in trade for food in low-productive farming areas. This helped {{supplement}} the diets of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> barter for food - and allowed those with very productive lands to focus on farming. For instance, Chaco Canyon area produced large amounts of surplus food which was traded for pottery.|$|R

50|$|The {{arrival of}} the railway in 1931 stimulated the {{development}} of the East Hills district. Prior to this, the district was rural. There was a soldiers' settlement at Milperra which consisted mostly of poultry and horticultural enterprises. The only public transportation was bus service to Bankstown railway station on the Bankstown line from various locations throughout the district, which posed a great inconvenience <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> visit the Sydney CBD for work.|$|R
50|$|Some arts in Dunhuang {{show the}} rituals that people used {{as part of}} Buddhism. In China, people often {{regarded}} icons of the Buddha as sacred objects with magical potency. Because of the unknown dangers on the Silk Road, <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> pass through would pray to the statues or portraits of the Buddha {{in order to receive}} the conferment of a blessing. Due to the high demand of trading along the Silk Road, the worship of Buddhism was thriving in Tang times.|$|R

5000|$|Six {{months after}} the passage of Law 121, an {{addendum}} was passed that legalized sterilization of “the insane, idiots, degenerates, or those demented {{to such a degree that}} their defect is considered incurable or hereditarily transmissible.” With the help of medical professionals, the Section of Eugenics and Mental Health was in charge of identifying <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be sterilized. While this law passed, it is not clear whether or not individuals were actually sterilized due to the lack of clarity in medical and historical records.|$|R
50|$|In July 2009, VDOT closed 19 of its rest {{areas around}} the state, leaving some {{stretches}} of highway, such as the heavily traveled and often congested I-95 northbound between Washington, D.C. and Richmond, a distance of 106 mi, without a rest stop. Drivers complained that <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> use the restroom would have nowhere to go. VDOT countered that the I-95 corridor is highly developed, and many businesses have restrooms, and that closing the rest stops would save VDOT 9 million dollars toward its 2.6 billion dollar budget deficit.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} IDEFs {{were developed}} {{since the mid-1970s}} {{for the purpose of}} enhancing communication among <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> decide how their existing systems were to be integrated. IDEF0 was designed to allow a graceful expansion of the description of a systems' functions through the process of function decomposition and categorization of the relations between functions (i.e., in terms of the Input, Output, Control, and Mechanism classification). IDEF1 was designed to allow the description of the information that an organization deems important to manage in order to accomplish its objectives.|$|R

50|$|The term 'digital nervous system' {{is kind of}} an {{interesting}} one. The analogy, of course, is to the biological nervous system where you always have the information you need.
