5000|$|Holochroal {{eyes are}} {{compound}} eyes with many tiny lenses (sometimes more than 15,000, each 30-100μm, rarely larger). [...] They are {{the oldest and}} most common type of trilobite eye, and found in all orders of trilobite from the Cambrian to the Permian periods. Lenses (composed of calcite) covered a curved, kidney-shaped visual surface in a hexagonal close <b>packing</b> <b>system,</b> with a single corneal membrane covering all lenses. Unlike in schizochroal eyes, adjacent lenses were in direct contact with one another. Lens shape generally depended on cuticle thickness. The lenses of trilobites with thin cuticles were thin and biconvex, whereas those with thick cuticles had thick lenses, which in extreme cases, could be thick columns with the outer surface flattened and the inner surface hemispherical. Regardless of lens thickness, however, the point at which light was focused was roughly the same distance below the lens.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this paper, we {{deal with}} {{a certain type of}} {{automated}} food <b>packing</b> <b>system</b> with n hoppers. The system repeats throwing some amount of foods into empty hoppers to make all hoppers full of foods, and collecting the foods from several hoppers to pack them into a single package. We treat foods thrown into each hopper as an item i with an integer weight wi. Given a set I of n items in the hoppers, the <b>packing</b> <b>system</b> chooses a subset I ′ (⊆ I) of items, and puts them into a package so that the total weight of items is at least a specified target weight B. The <b>packing</b> <b>system</b> then throws new items into the empty hoppers, and the set I is updated to be the union of the remaining items in I − I ′ and the new items. Repeating such packing operations, it produces a large number of packages one by one. In the <b>packing</b> <b>system,</b> an item may stay {{for a long time in}} some hopper until it is chosen for packing. To avoid such a situation, we introduce a priority γi for each item i, and formulate the problem of choosing a subset I ′ as a bi-criteria discrete optimization problem in which one objective is to minimize ∑ i∈I ′ wi such that ∑ i∈I ′ wi ≥ B must be satisfied, and the other is to maximize ∑ i∈I ′ γi. In this paper, we propose an O(n 2 wmax) time algorithm based on dynamic programming to obtain a nondominated solution, where wmax is an upper bound on the weight of an item. We also report the results on computational experiments conducted to examine the performance of the proposed approach...|$|E

In this study three different ways of delivering disposables for a laminectomy procedure were considered: 1) multiple distributors of disposables, 2) single distributor of disposables, and 3) the <b>pack</b> <b>system</b> (CDS by Medline). The first comparison was of multiple distributors vs. a single distributor with a cost difference of $ 90. 08 per procedure and $ 18, 916. 80 annually, multiple distributor costing less.

40|$|Minimum {{void ratio}} or maximum packing density is an {{important}} soil property in geotechnical engineering. It apply to volume change tendency control, fluid conductivity control and particles movement. Previous researchers have attempted to predict maximum packing density by empirical/graphic method, rock correction method, alpha method. Based on the concepts of F. de Larrard in concrete mixture research, we have developed a mathematic model that can predict the minimum void ratio for soils {{with a wide range}} of particle size. Probability density function-lognormal distribution was tested and used to provide a reasonable representation for soils with a range of grain-size distribution. We incorporate the lognormal distribution in the mathematical model, and predict the minimum void ratio for various types of soil gradations. The validity of the model is evaluated. The evaluation of the model is also performed on several sets of data in the literature, which include binary <b>packing</b> <b>system</b> of steel balls, ternary <b>packing</b> <b>system</b> of spheres, mixtures of round and crushed aggregates, and soils containing gravelly sand with silt.

One model assumes a hexagonal packing pattern of the neighboring fibers whereas the other assumes that the neighboring fibers are packed in a square pattern.

The cooling process of the composite was simulated and then a transverse loading is applied to the composite.

40|$|International audienceA {{datacenter}} can {{be viewed}} as a dynamic bin <b>packing</b> <b>system</b> where servers host applications with varying resource requirements and varying relative placement constraints. When those needs are no longer satisfied, the system has to be reconfigured. Virtualization allows to distribute applications into Virtual Machines (VMs) to ease their manipulation. In particular, a VM can be freely migrated without disrupting its service, temporarily consuming resources both on its origin and destination. We introduce the Bin Repacking Scheduling Problem in this context. This problem is to find a final packing and to schedule the transitions from a given initial packing, accordingly to new resource and placement requirements, while minimizing the average transition completion time. Our CP-based approach is implemented into Entropy, an autonomous VM manager which detects reconfiguration needs, generates and solves the CP model, then applies the computed decision. CP provides the awaited flexibility to handle heterogeneous placement constraints and the ability to manage large datacenters with up to 2, 000 servers and 10, 000 VMs...|$|E

It is found that the granule morphology is the decisive factor affecting the performance and type of connectivity among granules. Therefore, granule morphology parameter is also the decisive factor affecting the parameter of connectivity performance of granule. The size of contact area between granules, the value of granule expansion coefficient and the granule size (distance) are the major parameters affecting the connectivity performance among granules. Considerable difference exists in performance between point-contact type and surface-contact type. The connectivity performance of point-contact type is subject to the effect of the acting force among the granules to a certain extent, while that of surface-contact type is far less influenced by the acting force.
