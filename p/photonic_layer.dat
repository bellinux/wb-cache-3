The integration of a <b>photonic</b> <b>layer</b> on an electronic circuit has been studied with three routes. For combined fabrication at the front end level, several building blocks using a silicon on insulator rib technology have been developed: slightly etched rib waveguide with low (0. 1 [*]dB/cm) propagation loss, a high speed and high responsivity Ge integrated photodetector and a 10 [*]GHz Si modulators. Next, a wafer bonding of silicon rib and stripe technologies was achieved above the metallization layers of a CMOS wafer. Last, direct fabrication of a <b>photonic</b> <b>layer</b> at the back-end level was achieved using low-temperature processes with amorphous silicon waveguide (loss 5 [*]dB/cm), followed by the molecular bonding of InP dice and by the processing in microelectronics environment of InP μsources and detector...|$|E

The ability of the occluded Pluronic P 123 mesostructures to solubilize guest molecules made these films ideal host matrices for organic dyes and molecular assemblies, possessing substantial nonlinear susceptibilities. These films were explored for use as the <b>photonic</b> <b>layer</b> in all-optical time-to-space converters and proved successful at increasing the optical response of the intercalated dyes {{to a point that}} would make these composite films applicable for use as the <b>photonic</b> <b>layer.</b> Recording of a dynamical grating in a single-pulse regime has been obtained. Since the dynamical grating exhibits the fast relaxation time (up to 10  ns), the nonlinear mechanism represents an electronic excitation of the photosensitive molecules. As far as the dye molecules are distributed in nanoporous silica, a model of ‘gas of molecular dye’ may be rightly used in order to consider nonlinear optical properties in the nanostructured hybrid films. We suppose that further improvement of the nonlinear optical nanomaterials may follow on the way to embed additional inclusions, which will not promote the heat accumulation in the host matrix and will lead to effective dissipation of the heat energy.|$|E

In this case, as Rh 6 G has its strong absorption and fluorescence in the visible region, it is often necessarily taken to minimize the self-assembly aggregation process between individual dye molecules.|$|E

Intercalation of dyes within a silica matrix tends to enhance their photophysical properties as a result of isolation within the photochemically stable inorganic micro-environment. In such an environment, the number of deactivation pathways, which are available for return to the ground state after photoexcitation, is substantially reduced for the majority of dyes.

The development of elementary passive and active components (including detectors and modulators), which are mainly fabricated on the silicon on insulator platform for CMOS-compatible fabrication, has reached such a performance level that the integration challenge of silicon photonics with microelectronic circuits should be addressed. Since crystalline silicon can only be grown from another silicon crystal, {{making it impossible to}} deposit in this state, the optical devices are typically limited to a single layer.

40|$|In many {{applicative}} fields, fiber-optic {{devices are}} bound to be replaced by their integrated counterparts, which offer large benefits in terms of costs, size, robustness, and suitability for mass-production. Indeed, integrated technologies make use of fabrication processes, similar to those that have been employed in electronics for several decades, enabling the realization of many different components and functionalities that can be gathered together on a small photonic chip. However, a strong limitation of conventional integrated optical technologies is that they are inherently planar. This means that only architectures lying on a common <b>photonic</b> <b>layer</b> can be fabricated, whereas structures extending in a full 3 D space are not generally allowed. To circumvent this limit, a discrete number of photonic layers can be stacked, as it happens in electronics, even though in integrated optics, vertical connections are much more tricky and only a few guiding layers can be reasonably overlapped...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—DCAF is a {{directly}} connected arbitration free photonic crossbar that {{is realized}} by {{taking advantage of}} multiple <b>photonic</b> <b>layers</b> connected with <b>photonic</b> vias. In order to evaluate DCAF we developed a detailed implementation model for the network and analyzed the power and performance on a variety of benchmarks, including SPLASH- 2 and synthetic traces. Our results demonstrate that the overhead required by arbitration is non-trivial, especially at high loads. Eliminating the need for arbitration, sizing the buffers carefully and retransmitting lost packets when there is contention results in a 44 % reduction in average packet latency without additional power overhead. We also use an analytical model for ScaLAPACK QR decomposition and find that a 64 processor DCAF could outperform a 1024 node cluster connected with 40 Gbps links on matrices up to ∼ 500 MB in size.

30|$|With {{using the}} dynamic {{holography}} on thin nanostructures films, the spatial switching with high contrast comes naturally owing to two features: (i) multiple diffraction orders appear due to diffraction of writing beams on the induced dynamical grating and (ii) {{the existence of}} the diffraction depends on the intensity of writing beams, what is general for nonlinear optical materials. Except for that, the spatial beam multiplexing may be carried out by means of the diffraction of a weak probe beam on a stable phase grating. In this case, the number of the diffraction orders and their intensities are defined by a form of the grating, i.e., its period, the phase modulation depth, and the shape of the profile of the line [15]. The recent growth in network-connected devices has lead to an increasing demand on the telecommunications network to interconnect these devices with the possible lowest data transfer delay. Thus far, the materials that have shown the most promise to be used as the thin-film <b>photonic</b> <b>layer</b> are either the molecular beam epitaxy grown semiconductors or the neat organic dye films [16]. Organic films are certainly a more cost-effective photonic material since they can be readily fabricated at room temperature, using spin or dipcoating techniques. Such films have been shown to have excellent transmission characteristics and optical responses well into the subpicosecond domain. But these films tend to suffer from poor photostability, which limits their use as the <b>photonic</b> <b>layer.</b> The best active layer material would be one that combines high photostability of the semiconductors and the ease of fabrication as well as the transmission characteristics of organic films. A proven method to fabricate such hybrid materials is by incorporating suitable organic dyes into optically inert inorganic matrices. This can be made using several different methods, but the sol-gel method has been the most extensively applied over the years [17, 18]. In this method, the fabrication of glass-like materials is passed through the hydrolysis and condensation of the desired metal alkoxide. By far, the most widely fabricated inorganic matrices are silicate based, due to the excellent physical and optical properties of the resultant materials.|$|E

InP integrated photonic circuits offer high-performance amplifiers, switches, modulators, detectors, and de/multiplexers in the same wafer-scale processes.
