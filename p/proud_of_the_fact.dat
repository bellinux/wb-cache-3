25|$|Sirius Black, nicknamed Padfoot {{because his}} Animagus form takes {{the shape of}} a dog, is the last heir to the House of Black, a once notable pure-blood Wizarding family. He is the older brother of Regulus Arcturus Black and a cousin of Narcissa Malfoy, Andromeda Tonks, and Bellatrix Lestrange. He {{rejected}} his family's pure-blood elitism and reverence for the Dark Arts. In contrast to his home life, Sirius greatly enjoyed life at Hogwarts. He was <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he was the only Black to be sorted into Gryffindor. He was inseparable from his best friend James 'Prongs' Potter and befriended Remus 'Moony' Lupin and Peter 'Wormtail' Pettigrew.

Major Günther Capito had joined the unit in the spring of 1943. Capito was a former bomber pilot who had {{retrained}} on fighters. After scoring his fifth victory, Capito asked to be Hartmann's wingman. Hartmann refused initially, believing Capito was insufficiently trained on Messerschmitts.

Seaborg was <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the Cal Bears won their first and only National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) basketball championship in 1959, while he was chancellor. The football team also won the conference title and played in the Rose Bowl that year.

500|$|Contraception {{was legal}} in the United States {{throughout}} most of the 19th century, but in the 1870s a social purity movement grew in strength, aimed at outlawing vice in general, and prostitution and obscenity in particular.Engelman, pp. 13–14. Composed primarily of Protestant moral reformers and middle-class women, the Victorian-era campaign also attacked contraception, which was viewed as an immoral practice that promoted prostitution and venereal disease. Anthony Comstock, a postal inspector and leader in the purity movement, successfully lobbied for the passage of the 1873 Comstock Act, a federal law prohibiting mailing of [...] "any article or thing designed or intended for the prevention of conception or procuring of abortion" [...] as well as any form of contraceptive information. Many states also passed similar state laws (collectively known as the Comstock laws), sometimes extending the federal law by outlawing the use of contraceptives, as well as their distribution. Comstock was <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he was personally responsible for thousands of arrests and the destruction of hundreds of tons of books and pamphlets.|$|E
500|$|In March 2013 Mendes said {{he would}} not return to direct the next film in the series, then known as Bond 24; he later recanted and {{announced}} that he would return, as he found the script and the plans for the long-term future of the franchise appealing. Nicolas Winding Refn would later reveal that he turned down an offer to direct the movie. In directing Skyfall and Spectre, Mendes became the first director to oversee two consecutive Bond films since John Glen directed The Living Daylights and Licence to Kill in 1987 and 1989. Dennis Gassner returned as the film's production designer, while cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema took over from Roger Deakins. In July 2015 Mendes noted that the combined crew of Spectre numbered over one thousand, making it a larger production than Skyfall. Craig is listed as co-producer. He considered the credit a high point of his career, saying [...] "I'm just so <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that my name comes up somewhere else on the titles." ...|$|E
500|$|Lodge {{compensated}} for the setback by helping secure the position of Assistant Secretary for Theodore Roosevelt, a brash and aggressive New Yorker. Long and Roosevelt did not get along: in addition to personality differences, Roosevelt pushed a view to aggressively modernize and expand the Navy against Long's more studied and conservative approach. He preferred to expand the Navy gradually. As the nation's global interests grew, Long committed himself to the nation's peaceful growth in line with McKinley's policies. As {{a result of his}} disagreements with Roosevelt, Long took steps to control his subordinate. Roosevelt, on the other hand, sought ways to spur Long into action, writing [...] "I only wish that I could poison his mind so as to make him a shade more truculent in international matters". He also chafed against Long's policy of deferring much of the department's work to its permanent bureau chiefs, which resulted in constraints on the flow of information the administration received. Long was somewhat <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he knew little of the detail of naval affairs, commenting that he was [...] "a civilian who does not know the stem from the stern of a ship".|$|E

They were financially backed by Cilla Black and her husband Bobby Willis, Managing Director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Beatles' Apple Corps Peter Brown, and lawyer James Vallance-White. Nutters was the first shop on Savile Row to pioneer 'open windows' and had bold displays created by the then unknown Simon Doonan, resulting in the shop helping modernise <b>the</b> perception <b>of</b> Savile Row. Nutters of Savile Row dressed the entire social spectrum from <b>the</b> Duke <b>of</b> Bedford and Lord Montagu, to Mayor of San Francisco Willie Brown, to Mick and Bianca Jagger, Elton John and the Beatles. Their designs included Bianca Jagger's wedding suit and the costumes for the 1989 Batman film including those worn by Jack Nicholson. Tommy Nutter was <b>proudest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that <b>the</b> suits worn by three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Beatles on <b>the</b> front cover <b>of</b> Abbey Road were made by Nutters. Nutter left the business in 1976 {{and went to work}} at Kilgour, leaving Edward Sexton to continue running the business. Nutter died from complications arising from HIV/AIDS on 17 August 1992 at the Cromwell Hospital in London. Edward Sexton continues to work at his premises on Beauchamp Place, Knightsbridge.|$|R

The Neals initially planned to have Steve Dunn train and show Rebel, but he was concentrating on another horse and Rebel was paired with Steve's father, Bud Dunn. Dunn entered Rebel in the 1992 Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration, where the pair won the preliminary class before entering the World Grand Championship. Dark Spirit's Rebel was the favorite {{in a class of}} 13 horses, and when he won <b>the</b> record crowd <b>of</b> 28,000 began screaming his name. The win was the first World Grand Championship for 74-year-old Dunn, who had been training horses for over 40 years. In an interview after the win, Frank Neal noted that, while he was <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> owning a World Grand Champion, [...] "We are even <b>prouder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that our horse finally enabled Bud Dunn to accomplish this." [...] The owners also commented that 13 was a lucky number for Dark Spirit's Rebel; he was the 13th horse purchased at Harlinsdale Farm's 13th production sale, had the 13th stall in Dunn's stable, and arrived in Shelbyville, Tennessee (location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Celebration) 13 days before the World Grand Championship, among other examples.After his show career, Dark Spirit's Rebel sired a limited number of foals.

60|$|<b>The</b> woods <b>of</b> Fontainebleau {{stand to}} Paris in {{somewhat}} the same relation that Windsor Great Park stands to London; only, the scenery is more forest-like, {{and the trees}} are big and antique looking. By <b>the</b> outskirts <b>of</b> this great wood stands <b>the</b> pretty hamlet <b>of</b> Barbizon, a single long street of small peasant cottages, built with the usual French rural disregard of beauty or cleanliness. At <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> street, in a little three-roomed house, the painter and his wife settled down quietly; and here they lived for twenty-seven years, long after Millet's name had grown to be famous in <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> contemporary French painting. An English critic, who visited the spot in <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> Millet's greatest celebrity, was astonished to find the painter, whom {{he had come to}} see, strolling about the village in rustic clothes, and even wearing the sabots or wooden shoes which are in France <b>the</b> social mark <b>of</b> <b>the</b> working classes, much as the smock-frock used once to be in the remoter country districts of England. Perhaps this {{was a little bit of}} affectation on Millet's part--a sort <b>of</b> <b>proud</b> declaration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that in spite of fame and honours he still insisted upon counting himself a simple peasant; but if so, it was, after all, a very pretty and harmless affectation indeed.
