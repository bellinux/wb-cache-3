5|$|Although HTC has {{developed}} several notable Android devices, {{such as the}} Dream—the first publicly released Android device, it failed {{to capitalize on the}} first-mover advantage, and has struggled financially in recent years due to the increasing market share captured by other vendors such as Samsung and Apple. In some markets, HTC released numerous carrier-specific phones and relied heavily on wireless providers to promote its products, a strategy that was unsuccessful in the face of Samsung and Apple’s strong marketing efforts. The company’s flagship phone in 2012, the One X, received critical acclaim from reviewers, but was commercially unsuccessful {{in the wake of the}} Galaxy S III and the iPhone 5. In response, the company <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> bigger risks with their next flagship device to make it stand out among its competitors, and also <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a more direct role in promoting its products—doubling its marketing budget for 2013.|$|E

5|$|As the Tsaress <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{personal}} {{care of the}} church, the church has no parish, {{and there is no}} belltower to call the congregation to divine service. But she died before the construction ended, so the church was never cared for by Elizabeth Petrovna. After Elizabeth's death, the Kiev court took no interest maintaining in the church, last consecrated in 1767. Later, there were not enough funds to maintain the church, which left the maintaining of the church to private and voluntary funds, such as Andrey Muraviov.|$|E
5|$|Astana was {{at first}} not invited to the Giro. Six days before the race began, RCS Sport (the {{organizers}} of the Giro) went back on the decision to exclude Astana and extended them a late invitation. This change of heart was at least partly contingent on Contador, Leipheimer, and Klöden participating in the race. Having thought for two months prior {{that they would not}} compete in the Giro, most of Astana's riders had <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a break during the Tour of Italy, and Contador was actually vacationing on a beach when Bruyneel called him to tell him the team was headed to the Giro.|$|E

5|$|In 1959, {{a charismatic}} Ugandan named John Okello arrived in Pemba, {{working as a}} {{bricklayer}} and in February 1963 moved to Zanzibar.

The building had been sold for £130million in 1989, with construction <b>planned</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> three years, built by John Laing. SIS ultimately became the occupiers of the building.
