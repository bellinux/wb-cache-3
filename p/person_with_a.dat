5|$|Sultan Iskandar is {{reputed to}} have been a staunch disciplinarian, with {{willingness}} to occasionally voice personal opinions on governmental issues. On the personal side, subjects who have personally approached the Sultan in his later years described him as a <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> warm and generous personality. However, past critics had also argued that Sultan Iskandar was a <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> turbulent temper. These claims were made by citing records of past notorious incidents, which include an experience of being disinherited from being the Tunku Mahkota of Johor (or Crown Prince in English) by his father, in 1961, as well as a series of alleged criminal acts occurring between the 1970s and the 1990s which were published in the press and provoked widespread moral outrage within the Malaysian public.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{steps for}} {{evaluating}} a <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage are obtaining a medical history and performing a physical examination. The diagnosis cannot, however, {{be made on}} clinical grounds alone and in general medical imaging and possibly a lumbar puncture is required to confirm or exclude bleeding.|$|E

5|$|On 18 January 2007, Kobasa et al.

This may explain why the 1918 flu had its surprising effect on younger, healthier people, as a <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> stronger immune system would potentially have a stronger overreaction.|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} {{of pain in}} <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> intellectual disability (ID) is often a difficult undertaking complicated by idiosyncratic reactions or vague descriptions. The <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ID may also be unable to verbally communicate their discomfort. For the carer who knows the individual <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ID, knowing how they respond to painful stimuli assists the carer to detect new instances of pain. The emergency nurse is unlikely to have met the <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ID and therefore detecting pain by observing behaviour or using self-report measures is unlikely to succeed. There have been some attempts to categorise behavioural responses to pain by people <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ID, however, {{they have not been}} developed into a useful assessment tool. Emergency nurses must therefore rely on the person who knows the <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ID. [URL]...|$|R

5|$|Because the {{ketogenic}} diet {{alters the}} body's metabolism, it is a first-line therapy {{in children with}} certain congenital metabolic diseases such as pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) deficiency and glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome, which prevent the body from using carbohydrates as fuel, leading to a dependency on ketone bodies. The ketogenic diet is beneficial in treating the seizures and some other symptoms in these diseases and is an absolute indication. On the other hand, it is absolutely contraindicated {{in the treatment of}} other diseases such as pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, porphyria and other rare genetic disorders of fat metabolism. A <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disorder of fatty acid oxidation is unable to metabolise fatty acids, which replace carbohydrates as the major energy source on the diet. On the ketogenic diet, their body would consume its own protein stores for fuel, leading to ketoacidosis, and eventually coma and death.|$|E
5|$|Both {{environmental}} factors and genetics {{are associated with}} alcoholism with about half the risk attributed to each. A <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> parent or sibling with alcoholism is {{three to four times}} more likely to be alcoholic themselves. Environmental factors include social, cultural, and behavioral influences. High stress levels, anxiety, as well as inexpensive easily accessible alcohol increases risk. People may continue to drink partly to prevent or improve symptoms of withdrawal. A low level of withdrawal may last for months following stopping. Medically, alcoholism is considered both a physical and mental illness. Both questionnaires and certain blood tests may detect people with possible alcoholism. Further information is then collected to confirm the diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|Goffman's book Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity (1963) {{examines}} how, {{to protect}} their identities when they depart from approved standards of behavior or appearance, people manage impressions of themselves – mainly through concealment. Stigma pertains to the shame that a person may feel {{when he or she}} fails to meet other people's standards, and to the fear of being discredited – which causes the individual not to reveal his or her shortcomings. Thus, a <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> criminal record may simply withhold that information from fear of being judged by whomever that person happens to encounter.|$|E
5|$|MS is not {{considered}} a hereditary disease; however, a number of genetic variations {{have been shown to}} increase the risk. Some of these genes appear to have higher levels of expression in microglial cells than expected by chance. The probability of developing the disease is higher in relatives of an affected <b>person,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> greater risk among those more closely related. In identical twins both are affected about 30% of the time, while around 5% for non-identical twins and 2.5% of siblings are affected with a lower percentage of half-siblings. If both parents are affected the risk in their children is 10 times that of the general population. MS is also more common in some ethnic groups than others.|$|E
5|$|On May 1, 2004, a 53-year-old, 5' 2", 230lb (104.5kg) {{man from}} Bloomfield, Connecticut, {{fell out of}} his coaster seat during the last turn and was killed. Reports show that the ride {{attendant}} had not checked that the guest's ride restraint was secure as his girth was too large for the T-bar-shaped ride restraint to close properly. The victim's family said that due to his various medical conditions, such as cerebral palsy, he shouldn't {{have been allowed to}} ride. The park stated that the federal Americans with Disabilities Act forbids them from denying a ride to a <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disability as long as the person can get on the ride by themselves.|$|E

Meanwhile, Roxas, Sora's Nobody, is trapped in a virtual simulation of Twilight Town, created by DiZ to merge Roxas with his original self to restore Sora's power. DiZ's plans are threatened when Nobodies led by Axel, Roxas's former friend in Organization XIII, infiltrate the virtual town. However, Roxas is able to repel the Nobodies and finally merges with Sora. Sora, Donald, and Goofy wake up in the real Twilight Town and meet King Mickey and Yen Sid, who send them on another journey. Their goal is to find Riku and figure out the plans of Organization XIII, who control the Nobodies—the empty shell left over when a <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> strong heart is turned into a Heartless.

5|$|The author {{noted that}} the {{character}} of Lavi was popular with fans, placing third in a poll (behind Allen and Kanda) despite infrequent appearances in later story arcs, and she promised that Lavi would return. The story arc involving Alma Karma, featuring several characters, was difficult for the author; as a result, the next arc in which Allen leaves the Black Order contained fewer characters per chapter due to its different format. The character of Apocryphos was introduced to hint at the Heart, a plot element briefly described in a past storyline which would later reappear. Due to Jump Square (the manga's magazine at the time) readership—older men, rather than children—Hoshino found Allen the most difficult character to write. She does not want Allen's problems in recent story arcs to lead to portraying him as a troubled teenager, preferring to show him as a cheerful <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> balance of strength and sorrow. After D.Gray-man dark narrative, Hoshino plans to write more lighthearted series in the future.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{it being}} a simpler project due to the {{original}} art being reusable {{turned out to be}} untrue: because so much time had passed since the original's release, there were multiple parts that had to be reworked, leading to a process similar to creating a whole new game from scratch. All character graphics were redone, special effects were changed, and certain animations were added, such as sleeping animations. Some item placements were changed, the overall difficulty was adjusted, and some characters' battle statistics were altered; one such instance was making Kechi stronger than Oryu, due to it being perceived as illogical that a <b>person</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sword would be weaker than a person fighting with her bare hands.|$|E
