30|$|SEM {{revealed}} {{the increase in}} the size of bacterial cells in the presence of Cd 2 + which clearly indicated the biosorption of Cd 2 +. It was further confirmed by EDX and FTIR. The characteristic peaks of carboxyl, amino and phosphate groups appearing in FTIR analysis confirmed the presence of these moieties in bacterium and the shift in these peaks was used to address the binding of Cd 2 + with bacterium. In short, the peaks at 1635 and 1538 /cm recognized the presence of amide linkage, and the shift in these peaks to 1647 and 1552 /cm respectively was due to chemical interaction of Cd 2 + with amide group of bacterium. It is presumed that cadmium mainly adsorbed on bacterium by interacting with nitrogen atoms of amide groups. The peaks appearing in range of 1000 – 1320 /cm represented the presence of carbon and phosphorous containing oxygen atoms, and suppression in intensity of these peaks indicated their interaction with Cd 2 + (Parikh and Chorover 2006). The peak at 1047 and 1157 /cm recognized the presence of carbonyl group and the shift in these peaks and transmittance level was due to chemical interaction of Cd 2 + with carbonyl moieties. Addition to this, the <b>percentage</b> <b>transmittance</b> of peaks in FTIR spectra of bacterium treated with cadmium, was considerably less significant than those of control bacterium.

For E 2, two of the 0. 8 -mm-thick discs were covered with dentin (1. 2 - and 1. 4 -mm-thick) and two with dentin + enamel (1. 5 -mm-thick). The 1. 1 -mm-thick specimens were submitted to the same veneering procedures. Specimens were evaluated by UV-Vis transmittance analysis and the <b>percentage</b> of <b>transmittance</b> was recorded. Irradiance through each specimen was evaluated with a quartz-tungsten-halogen (QTH), used in continuous or intermittent exposure modes, or a blue lightemitting diode (LED). Data were analyzed by Dunnett???s test, ANOVA and Tukey???s test at 5 % significance level. Exposure through ceramic decreased the irradiance for all ceramics. Irradiance through EST was significantly higher than through EMP. For E 2, reduction in irradiance depended on the core and/or veneer thickness. The QTH intermittent mode showed higher irradiance than the continuous mode, and both showed higher irradiance than LED. The ceramic significantly influenced irradiance and transmittance, which were found to decrease with the increase in thickness...|$|R
40|$|Six {{mushroom}} samples (Ganoderma lucidum, Cordyceps militaris, Lignosus rhinocerotis, Pleurotus giganteus, Pleurotus floridanus and Auricularia polytricha) {{were screened}} for their anticoagulant activity. Mushroom samples provided were freeze-dried and blended into powder form. Different concentrations of aqueous mushroom extracts {{were added to}} one ml of fresh bovine blood and well mixed. From the observations, among the six mushroom samples, only two samples namely A. polytricha and L. rhinocerotis showed anticoagulant activities in the preliminary screening. Crude extracts of A. polytricha and L. rhinocerotis were tested for their In-vitro anti-platelet activity using fresh human blood. Platelet rich plasma 1. 3 x 108 {{was obtained from the}} fresh human blood and the platelet aggregation activity was measured using spectrophotometer in <b>percentage</b> of <b>transmittance</b> values. Adenosine diphosphate was used to induce platelet aggregation in the study. Five concentrations (5 mg/mL, 10 mg/mL, 15 mg/mL, 20 mg/mL and 25 mg/mL) of crude mushroom extracts were tested. Anti-platelet activity was shown in L. rhinocerotis crude extract. The crude sample was then dialysed using dialysis tubing 12 kDa in distilled water overnight. The proteins were then precipitated out using acetone and the in-vitro anti-platelet activity test was performed again. The protein precipitated also showed anti-platelet aggregation activity in the study. Then, aqueous two phase system (ATPS) was done using 4 g of polyethylene glycol 50...|$|R
