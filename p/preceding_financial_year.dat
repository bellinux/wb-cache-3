30|$|As {{this debate}} was going on, {{as to which}} {{database}} to use, India {{was going through a}} reformation in its CSR arena.

Keeping this transformation in view, the criteria for inclusion in the research was narrowed down to the selection criteria as laid down by the Government under Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013.

5000|$|The {{introduction}} of earnings-related unemployment and sickness benefits significantly reduced inequalities between those in work {{and those who}} were unemployed. In 1964, the net income received by the average wage earner, when on unemployment or sickness benefit, was only 45% of what he received at work, whereas by 1968 the figure had increased to 75%. The earnings-related supplement for unemployment benefits was made available to those who had earned at least £450 in the previous financial year. The supplement was paid after a twelve-day waiting period, and the rate was one-third the amount by which the average weekly earnings (up to £30) exceeded £9. The earnings-related supplement was based on the assertion that a person's commitments for mortgages, rents, and hire purchase agreements were related to their normal earnings and could not be adjusted quickly when experiencing a loss of normal income. As a result of this supplement, the total benefit of a married man with two children went up by 52%, and that of a single man by 117.% The duration was limited to 26 weeks, while the total benefit was restricted to 85% of average weekly earnings in the <b>preceding</b> <b>financial</b> <b>year.</b> From 1965 to 1970, including Earnings Related Supplement, unemployment or sickness benefits as a percentage of net income at average earnings rose from 27% to 53.3% for a single person, 41.2% to 65.2% for a married couple, and from 49.3% to 72.7% for a married couple with two children. According to one study, the {{introduction of}} earnings-related unemployment benefits increased the unemployment income “of a typical married man with two children from 40 percent to 60 percent of average employment income.” ...|$|E

40|$|The Competition Act 89 of 1998 (Competition Act), {{contains}} merger review {{provisions that}} establish a mandatory merger filing regime for merger transactions {{that meet the}} statutory definition of a merger {{as well as the}} prescribed thresholds for notification. 1 The mandatory merger requirements are contained in section 13 (1) (b) and section 13 A(3), of the Competition Act. These sections prohibit any party from implementing a merger without the approval of the respective competition authority. Section 13 and 13 A read with 59 (1) (d) (vi) grants the Competition Tribunal (Tribunal), a competition regulator that is established in terms of section 26 (1) of the Act, the power to impose an administrative fine on the parties that contravene the provisions of sections 13 and 13 A. Section 59 (2) reads, An administrative penalty imposed in terms of subsection (1) may not exceed 10 % of the firm s annual turnover in the Republic and its exports from the Republic during the firm s <b>preceding</b> <b>financial</b> <b>year.</b> The prescribed administrative fine {{is the same as the}} fine that the Tribunal might impose on companies that are found guilty of engaging in prohibited practices contained in Chapter 2, which relates to, inter alia, cartel conduct 2 or abuse of dominance 3 or price discrimination. 4 By not making a distinction between the fines imposed for anti-competitive conduct under chapter 2, the Competition Act illustrates how important it is for merging companies to not implement the merger transaction without the approval of the competition authority. Despite the possibility of sanctions by the Tribunal and the imposition of a maximum fine of 10 %, of the companies turnover of the previous financial year, the Competition Act does not provide a definition or an explanation of what implementation means. A definition of the term implementation is important for two reasons, firstly it helps the merging companies to avoid conduct that contravenes section 13 and 13 A(3) and secondly, it ensures that the competition authorities are able to effectively use merger review to prevent conduct that facilitates or creates anti-competitive markets. The question that this dissertation seeks to answer is, what does implementation means for purpose of merger review? This dissertation considered the merger review provisions that are applied in the European Union s (EU) legislations and the case law of the European Commission (EU) to find out how the term implementation has been defined in the EU. A comparison of the EC merger control regime and the South African merger control regime assisted to identify possible similarities and differences that might assist to find the definition of the tern implementation. This dissertation identified factors, in the considered EU decisions, which are important for merger review in the South African context as these factors assist to understand how the merging companies might avoid contravening the South African Competition Act in the context of a merger. The factors identified in the EU decisions include, inter alia, merger agreement, control, jurisdiction and effects in South Africa. Although these factors are not exhaustive, the competition authorities need to consider all factors together when determining what implementation means. When applying the above factors to South African merger review it can be concluded that, implementation for purpose of merger review entails the enforcement of the terms of a merger agreement or terms of reference of the merger agreement, to the extent that such conduct constitute control either by way of majority shares or by way of influencing the business of the company being acquired. The enforcement of such merger agreement terms must take place in South Africa and do not necessarily need to have any direct effects on competition.
