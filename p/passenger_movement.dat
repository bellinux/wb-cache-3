25|$|The {{detailed}} report {{would have the}} line begin at Martinsried (the southwest extension to the current U6 line) and continue to Implerstraße, which would be expanded from three-track to four-track platforms. The existing service tunnel between Implerstrasse and Theresienwiese would be extended to two tracks, and at Theresienwiese the U9 would share platforms with the U4/U5 lines;. The station would be rebuilt from two-track to four-track platforms with wider platforms to reduce overcrowding and speed up <b>passenger</b> <b>movement.</b> From Theresienwiese, a new tunnel would spur toward its own platform underneath Central Station, continue to a new station Pinakotheken, then on to Giselastraße where it would rejoin the U3/U6 line in a station expanded from two-track to four-track platforms. The tunnel between there and Münchner Freiheit also would be built out from two tracks to four; and from Münchner Freiheit station, the U9 would continue to the current end of the U6, Garching-Forschungszentrum, while the U6 would terminate sooner at Fröttmaning.|$|E

An early development in this area was Oriel Chambers in Liverpool, England. It was only five floors high. Further developments led to the world's first skyscraper, the ten-story Home Insurance Building in Chicago, built in 1884–1885. While its height is not considered very impressive today, it was at that time.
