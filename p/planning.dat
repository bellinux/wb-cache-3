5|$|Conventional {{real estate}} {{development}} and urban <b>planning</b> activities are subject to conflicting interests and positional bargaining. The integrative negotiation approach emphasises mutual gains. The approach has been applied in land use <b>planning</b> and environmental management, but has not {{been used as a}} coordinated approach to {{real estate development}}, city design, and urban <b>planning.</b> Urban design management involves reordering the chain of events in the production of the built environment according to the principles of integrative negotiation. Such negotiation can be used in urban development and <b>planning</b> activities to reach more efficient agreements. This leads to integrative developments and more sustainable ways to produce the built environment.|$|E

5|$|On 31 December 2014, Modi {{announced}} that the <b>Planning</b> Commission had been scrapped. It was replaced with a body called the National Institution for Transforming India, or NITI Aayog. The <b>Planning</b> Commission was {{a legacy of the}} Indian Independence movement, although critics said that it was slowing economic growth. The move had the effect of greatly centralising the power previously with the <b>planning</b> commission in the person of the prime minister. It also reduced the extent of control individual states had over their financial allocation from the union government, and unlike the <b>planning</b> commission, it does not have the power to allocate funds. The <b>planning</b> commission had received heavy criticism in previous years for creating inefficiency in the government, and of not filling its role of improving social welfare: however, since the economic liberalisation of the 1990s, it had been the major government body responsible for measures related to social justice.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} <b>plan</b> {{execution}} on agents/robots in highly dy-namic environments. Besides a formal semantics of <b>plan</b> execution and a repre-sentation of <b>plans</b> as programs, we introduce {{the concept of}} <b>plan</b> invariants. <b>Plan</b> invariants are similar to loop invariants in imperative programs in {{that they have to}} be true during the whole <b>plan</b> execution cycle. Once a <b>plan</b> invariant fails the <b>plan</b> execution is stopped and other <b>plans</b> that are more appropriate in the current context are considered for execution instead. The use of <b>plan</b> invariants allows for an early detection of problems. <b>Plan</b> assumptions that are required for a <b>plan</b> to succeed are explicitly represented by <b>plan</b> invariants. ...|$|R

5|$|The <b>planning</b> {{system is}} {{critical}} to the viability and operation of GA aerodromes. With many cities lacking scheduled air transport services between them, and with GA access to commercial airports becoming increasingly difficult and expensive, a viable network of aerodromes supporting GA air transport operations is regarded as an important national issue. However, there is no unified national <b>planning</b> policy specific to GA aerodromes, and <b>planning</b> decisions relating to these are based on local issues that are not required to consider the national impact. Because aircraft are excluded from noise control legislation, the only recourse for people affected by aircraft noise is through the <b>planning</b> process, and this issue is the principal factor on which the majority of <b>planning</b> decisions relating to GA land use are made. GA is a specialist subject often unfamiliar to Local <b>Planning</b> Authorities, and most <b>planning</b> decisions relating to GA either refuse permission, or grant it with restrictive conditions. Little Gransden is just one example of a GA airfield required to comply with <b>planning</b> restrictions on the number of movements permitted, thereby inhibiting further development. Such restrictions, if poorly conceived, can make GA operations unviable or even unsafe.|$|E

25|$|Although {{acquisition}} <b>planning</b> can {{be useful}} to governments, there are several problems that must be considered.
