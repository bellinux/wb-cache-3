Of 1,200 men sent from Danzig, only 300 returned. Between 203 and 211 brothers of the Order were killed, out of 270 that participated in battle, including much of the Teutonic leadership—Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen, Grand Marshal Friedrich von Wallenrode, Grand Komtur Kuno von Lichtenstein, Grand Treasurer Thomas von Merheim, Marshal of Supply Forces Albrecht von Schwartzburg, and ten of the komturs. Markward von Salzbach, Komtur of Brandenburg (Ushakovo) and Heinrich Schaumburg, voigt of Sambia, were executed by order of Vytautas after the battle. The bodies of von Jungingen and other high-ranking officials were transported to Marienburg Castle for burial on 19 July. The bodies of lower-ranking Teutonic officials and 12 Polish knights were buried at the church in Tannenberg. The rest of the dead were buried in several mass graves. The highest-ranking Teutonic official to escape the battle was Werner von Tettinger, Komtur of Elbing (Elbląg).|$|E

2500|$|In 1996, David Neumark and William Wascher reexamined Card and Krueger's result using {{administrative}} <b>payroll</b> <b>records</b> from {{a sample}} of large fast food restaurant chains, and reported that minimum wage increases were followed by decreases in employment. An assessment of data collected and analyzed by Neumark and Wascher did not initially contradict the Card and Krueger results, but in a later edited version they found a four percent decrease in employment, and reported that [...] "the estimated disemployment effects in the payroll data are often statistically significant at the 5- or 10-percent level {{although there are some}} estimators and subsamples that yield insignificant—although almost always negative" [...] employment effects. Neumark and Wascher's conclusions were subsequently rebutted in a 2000 paper by Card and Krueger. A 2011 paper has reconciled the difference between Card and Krueger's survey data and Neumark and Wascher's payroll-based data. The paper shows that both datasets evidence conditional employment effects that are positive for small restaurants, but are negative for large fast-food restaurants. A 2014 analysis based on panel data found that the minimum wage reduces employment among teenagers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{an approach to}} detect hints on procurement fraud. It was developed {{within the context of}} a European Union project on fraud prevention. Procurement fraud is a special kind of fraud that occurs when employees cheat their own employers by executing or triggering bogus payments. The approach presented here is based on the idea to learn a similarity measure that compares an employee (or <b>payroll)</b> standing-data <b>record</b> to a creditor record, in order to detect creditors that are suspiciously similar to employees. To this ends, it combines several simple similarity measures like address similarity or spacial similarity using a weighting scheme. The weights, that is the overall similarity function, are learned from user input specifying whether a particular pair of payroll and creditor data records are similar. Key words: similarity measure learning, fraud detection, health care...|$|R
