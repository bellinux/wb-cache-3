40|$|Traditionally, health {{interventions}} {{implemented in}} Pakistan {{have been designed}} to increase the supply of maternal health services, but have not focused on reaching the <b>poorest</b> <b>women</b> or on providing high-quality services. Demand-side barriers to the utilization of health services are substantial in Pakistan, as are supply-side constraints to the provision of quality health care. This study uses data from the Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey 2006 – 07 to develop a profile of the <b>poorest</b> <b>women</b> in Pakistan in order to understand demand-side barriers to accessing maternal health care. The study shows stark differences in human capital, material and demographic resources between the <b>poorest</b> <b>women</b> and other women. It illustrates how these differences translate into low levels of service utilization among the <b>poorest</b> <b>women.</b> The purpose of the study is to stimulate a discussion of both the difficulty and the importance of reaching the <b>poorest</b> <b>women</b> with high-quality maternal health interventions. The findings from several pilot projects in Pakistan suggest that the <b>poorest</b> <b>women</b> can be reached at disproportionately higher rates than non-poor women through targeted, community-based, interventions. There is little demonstrable evidence, however, that high-quality care has been provided through these interventions. Evidence-based approaches, which have the potential to overcome financial and sociocultural barriers to service utilization, should be scaled up as soon as possible. However, measures should be taken to ensure that the quality of care provided through these interventions is adequate and able to lead to significant reductions in mortality...|$|R
5|$|For many <b>poor</b> <b>women</b> and {{men whose}} work hours {{have reached the}} point where they cannot cut back on leisure time anymore to make time for {{domestic}} and paid work, work intensity is an issue because they often intensify their work time by doing two or more activities at once, such as taking care of children while cooking. Work intensity can lead to many negative health consequences, such as lack of sleep, stress, and lack of recreation.|$|E
5|$|The social {{rigidity}} of the 1950s {{and early}} 1960s encountered a backlash as social movements {{to improve the}} standing of African Americans, the <b>poor,</b> <b>women,</b> and gays all became prominent. Of the latter two, the gay rights movement and the feminist movement connected after a violent confrontation occurred in New York City in the 1969 Stonewall riots. What followed was a movement characterized by a surge of gay activism and feminist consciousness that further transformed the definition of lesbian.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Mary Dennett focused {{her efforts}} on the peace movement, but she {{returned}} to the birth control movement in 1918. She continued to lead the NBCL, and collaborated with Sanger's NYWPC. In 1919, Dennett published a widely distributed educational pamphlet, The Sex Side of Life, which treated sex as a natural and enjoyable act. However, in the same year, frustrated with the NBCL's chronic lack of funding, Dennett broke away and formed the Voluntary Parenthood League (VPL). Both Dennett and Sanger proposed legislative changes that would legalize birth control, but they took different approaches: Sanger endorsed contraception but only under a physician's supervision; Dennett pushed for unrestricted access to contraception.Engelman, pp. 113–115. Sanger, a proponent of diaphragms, was concerned that unrestricted access would result in ill-fitting diaphragms and would lead to medical quackery.McCann (1994), pp. 71–72 gives examples that show Sanger's fears were justified. Dennett was concerned that requiring women to get prescriptions from physicians would prevent <b>poor</b> <b>women</b> from receiving contraception, and she was concerned about a shortage of physicians trained in birth control. Both legislative initiatives failed, partly because some legislators felt that fear of pregnancy {{was the only thing that}} kept women chaste. In the early 1920s, Sanger's leadership position in the movement solidified because she gave frequent public lectures, and because she took steps to exclude Dennett from meetings and events.|$|E
