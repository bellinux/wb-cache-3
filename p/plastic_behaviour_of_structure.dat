40|$|The problem {{related to}} the {{computation}} of bounds on plastic deformations for structures in plastic shakedown condition (alternating plasticity) is studied. In particular, reference is made to structures discretized by finite elements constituted by elastic perfectly plastic material and subjected to a special combination of fixed and cyclic loads. The load history is known during the steady-state phase, but it is unknown during the previous transient phase; so, as a consequence, {{it is not possible}} to know the complete elastic plastic structural response. The interest is therefore focused on the computation of bounds on suitable measures of the plastic strain which characterizes just the first transient phase of the structural response, whatever the real load history is applied. A suitable structural model is introduced, useful to describe the elastic <b>plastic</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> the <b>structure</b> in the relevant shakedown conditions. A special bounding theorem based on a perturbation method is proposed and proved. Such theorem allows us to compute bounds on any chosen measure of the relevant plastic deformation occurring at the end of the transient phase for the structure in plastic shakedown; it represents a generalization of analogous bounding theorems {{related to the}} elastic shakedown. Some numerical applications devoted to a plane steel structure are effected and discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} investigates the {{influence}} that polar material response has on the <b>plastic</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> thin-walled <b>structures</b> made <b>of</b> ideal fibre-reinforced materials (Spencer, 1972); or, equivalently, on the response of thin-walled fibrous composites within the first branch of the matrix dominated form (MDM) of the bimodal theory of plasticity (Soldatos, 2011; Dvorak and Bahei-El-Din, 1987). The plasticity studies mentioned above assume that fibres are infinitely thin and, therefore, perfectly flexible. They possess no bending stiffness and, hence, their negligible bending resistance cannot influence the developed stress state, which is accordingly described by a symmetric stress tensor. In contrast, the present study considers that if fibres resistant in bending are embedded in a material at high volume concentrations, their flexure produces couple-stress and, {{as a result of}} this kind <b>of</b> polar material <b>behaviour,</b> the stress tensor becomes non-symmetric. Under plane stress conditions that dominate <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> thin-walled <b>structures,</b> the stress-space and, therefore, conditions of plastic yield and relevant yield surfaces are thus four-dimensional. However, shapes and properties of initial yield surfaces relevant to the f 1 -branch of MDM are studied comprehensively by considering their projection on particular planes of such a four-dimensional stress-space. It then becomes easier understood that, in the regime of polar material response, a thin-walled <b>structure</b> made <b>of</b> ideal fibre-reinforced material deforms plastically when suitable combinations of shear stress values are reached simultaneously, rather than when only one of two unequal shear stress components reaches some maximum absolute value. Thus, polar material plasticity dismisses the conventional concept of material yield stress in shear and replaces it with a pair of two independent yield moduli. Existence of the latter is perceived as a theoretical justification of the expectation that, due to the presence of fibres, two rather than one shear yield parameters of the composite should be present and accountable for. The non-zero values of those parameters are shown to exert paramount influence on the form of the yield surface of the ideal fibre-reinforced material of interest...|$|R
40|$|The modes <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> a {{representative}} two-bar assembly with unequal areas and lengths under the simultaneous action of sustained mechani- al load and cyclic thermal gradient are investigated analytically. Three types <b>of</b> material <b>behaviour</b> are used: perfect plasticity, linear kinematic hardening and linear isotropic hardening. These simple models exhibit much <b>of</b> the <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> interest in design of structural components subjected to repeated thermal loads: elastic shakedown, reversed plasticity and ratcheting. The analyses provide closed form expressions for the mechanical-thermal load bounds {{of the various}} regimes of deformation. The cyclic <b>plastic</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> the <b>structure</b> is developed and analytical results are derived for the transient and steady state values of plastic strain. The results are applicable {{for a wide range}} of geometrical, material and loading parameters. Comparisons between perfect plasticity, kinematic and isotropic hardening models provide qualitative estimates of the cyclic inelastic <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> actual structural components which can be simulated by means of a two-bar assembly. The results also point out those load combinations at which thermal ratcheting experiments are more likely to yield the most useful informations. In the field of new constitutive relations, a single state variable theory of inelastic deformation is developed on the basis of the Bailey-Orowan concept of creep as the outcome of two competing mechanisms: strain hardening and thermal softening. The resulting theory is capable of representing primary creep, creep recovery, there reemergence of primary creep following a sudden increase in stress, effects of rest periods and past deformation history and strain rate sensitivity. The theory is not capable, however, of reproducing the features <b>of</b> material <b>behaviour</b> under reversed loading conditions. An attempt to describe the cyclic phenomena of metals on the basis of the two-state variable concept is presented. The material behaviour is characterized by means of the current size of the yield surface and a dimensionless parameter which represents the shape of the plastic hardening curve. The transient growth laws for these two parameters are developed from phenomenological data on annealed OFHC copper. The predictions of the model are in close agreement with the experimental cyclic hardening <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> copper. The model is used to obtain the inelastic response of a two-bar assembly subjected to cyclic thermal load and the results are compared to the closed form solutions of linear hardening models. Finally, a modification is suggested to the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> the proposed model in the light of recent work on the application of the state variable concept to the theory of plasticity. It is argued that the second parameter in the model should be taken as the current coordinates of the yield surface of the material...|$|R

However, {{the current state of}} research regarding temperature dependent material parameters for the description <b>of</b> the <b>plastic</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> magnesium sheet alloys is scarce in literature and accurate statements concerning yield criteria and appropriate characterization tests to describe the <b>plastic</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> a magnesium sheet alloy at elevated temperatures in deep drawing processes are to define.

40|$|During seismic events, {{the gravity}} loads may cause a {{reduction}} of the lateral stiffness of structures; inelastic deformations combined with horizontal loads (P-Δ effect) can bring {{to a state of}} dynamic instability that obviously influences building safety. Especially for flexible structures, the P-Δ effect amplifies structural deformations and resultants stresses, and thus may represent a source of sideway collapse. Since this type of collapse is the result of progressive accumulation of plastic deformation on structural components, the specific objective of this works is to study this effect on a three floor metallic frame (made of aluminium alloy). A non-linear finite element (FE) model of the frame has been developed to study the dynamic non-linear <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> the <b>structure,</b> and compare it with the experimental results obtained from a scaled model <b>of</b> the real <b>structure.</b> The FE model, where a simple isotropic hardening behaviour was assumed for the material, was not able to reproduce the real <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> the <b>structure.</b> Rather, the correct description <b>of</b> the cyclic <b>plastic</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> the material was essential for the numerical analysis <b>of</b> the <b>structure.</b> The characterization <b>of</b> the non-linear <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> the material was made by cyclic tension–compression tests on material specimen, from which the coefficients of Chaboche's model were properly calibrated.
