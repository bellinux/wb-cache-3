Gale asks Gus about the blue meth being produced by chemist Walter White (Bryan Cranston), who at this <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> yet working for Gus. Gus explains he has reservations about hiring Walter, but Gale insists Gus hire {{him because of}} his superior product.|$|E

The value for this is commonly set at 0.1 or 0.2% plastic strain. The offset value is given as a subscript, e.g., Rp0.2=310 MPa. High strength steel and aluminum alloys do not exhibit a yield point, so this offset yield point is used on these materials.|$|E

25|$|If K is a field, {{then the}} ring R = K/(x2,xy) (the {{coordinate}} ring {{of a line}} with an embedded <b>point)</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> Cohen–Macaulay. This follows, for example, by Miracle Flatness: R is finite over the polynomial ring A = K, with degree 1 over points of the affine line Spec A with y ≠ 0, but with degree 2 over the point y = 0 (because the K-vector space K/(x2) has dimension 2).|$|E

25|$|Systematic {{sampling}} (also {{known as}} interval sampling) relies on arranging {{the study population}} according to some ordering scheme and then selecting elements at regular intervals through that ordered list. Systematic sampling involves a random start and then proceeds with the selection of every kth element from then onwards. In this case, k=(population size/sample size). It {{is important that the}} starting <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> automatically the first in the list, but is instead randomly chosen from within the first to the kth element in the list. A simple example would be to select every 10th name from the telephone directory (an 'every 10th' sample, also referred to as 'sampling with a skip of 10').|$|E
25|$|In the Master Agreement, LGE {{required}} Intel to {{give its}} customers {{notice that the}} patent license does not extend to any product made by combining a licensed Intel microprocessor product with any other product (for example, a computer containing the Intel microprocessor products). The Master Agreement also provided that its breach would {{have no effect on}} the License Agreement and would not be grounds for its termination. Apparently, LGE was willing to allow Intel’s customers to combine the microprocessor products with products not licensed by LGE, but only upon payment of a further royalty to LGE for the right to do so. This <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> discussed in the Court’s opinion, which recites the facts only in very limited terms because the record was under seal to protect trade secrets.|$|E
25|$|In {{relation}} to this interpretation, William Empson suggests that Katherina was originally performed {{by an adult}} male actor rather than a young boy. He argues that the play indicates on several occasions that Katherina is physically strong, and even capable of over-powering Petruchio. For example, this is demonstrated off-stage when the horse falls on her as she is riding to Petruchio's home, and {{she is able to}} lift it off herself, and later when she throws Petruchio off a servant he is beating. Empson argues that the <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> that Katherina is, as a woman, weak, but that she is not well cast in the role in life which she finds herself having to play. The end of the play then offers blatant irony when a strong male actor, dressed as a woman, lectures women on how to play their parts.|$|E

25|$|Warning {{signs are}} often used where sight {{distance}} is insufficient. The US MUTCD requires Stop Ahead, Yield Ahead or Signal Ahead signs at intersections where the traffic control device is not visible from a distance equal to the stopping sight distance at speed of approaching traffic. Hill Blocks View signs can be used where crest vertical curves restrict sight distance. However, many jurisdictions still expect drivers to use ordinary care regarding conditions readily apparent to a driver, without the prompting of a sign. The care and focus ordinarily required of a driver against certain types of hazards may be somewhat amplified on roads with lower functional classification. The probability of spontaneous traffic increases proportionally to the density of access points, and this density should be readily apparent to a driver even when a specific access <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>not.</b> For this reason, full corner sight distance is almost never required for individual driveways in urban high-density residential areas, and street parking is commonly permitted within the right-of-way.|$|E
25|$|It {{can also}} be shown that if an extreme <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a maximum point of the {{objective}} function then there is an edge containing the point so that the objective function is strictly increasing on the edge {{moving away from the}} point. If the edge is finite then the edge connects to another extreme point where the objective function has a greater value, otherwise the objective function is unbounded above on the edge and the linear program has no solution. The simplex algorithm applies this insight by walking along edges of the polytope to extreme points with greater and greater objective values. This continues until the maximum value is reached or an unbounded edge is visited, concluding that the problem has no solution. The algorithm always terminates because the number of vertices in the polytope is finite; moreover since we jump between vertices always in the same direction (that of the objective function), we hope that the number of vertices visited will be small.|$|E
25|$|Steinitz' {{original}} proof involved {{finding a}} sequence of Δ-Y and Y-Δ transforms that reduce any 3-connected planar graph to K4, the graph of the tetrahedron. A Y-Δ transform removes a degree-three vertex from a graph, adding edges between all of its former neighbors if those edges did not already exist; the reverse transformation, a Δ-Y transform, removes the edges of a triangle from a graph and replaces them by a new degree-three vertex adjacent to the same three vertices. Once such a sequence is found, it can be reversed to give {{a sequence of}} Δ-Y and Y-Δ transforms that build up the desired polyhedron step by step starting from a polyhedron. Each Y-Δ transform transform in this sequence can be performed by slicing off a degree-three vertex from a polyhedron. A Δ-Y transform can be performed by removing a triangular face from a polyhedron and extending its neighboring faces until {{the point where they}} meet, but only when that triple intersection point of the three neighboring faces is on the correct side of the polyhedron; when the triple intersection <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> on the correct side, a projective transformation of the polyhedron suffices to move it to the correct side. Therefore, by induction on the number of Δ-Y and Y-Δ transforms needed to reduce a given graph to K4, every polyhedral graph can be realized as a polyhedron.|$|E

They were {{probably}} preserved in situ (without post-mortem transportation), although this <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> universally accepted. The assemblage, while less diverse than the Ediacara- or Nama-types, resembles Carboniferous suspension-feeding communities, which may suggest filter feeding – by most interpretations, the assemblage is found in water too deep for photosynthesis. The low diversity may reflect the depth of water – which would restrict speciation opportunities – or it may just be too young for a rich biota to have evolved. Opinion is currently divided between these conflicting hypotheses.|$|E

500|$|Valve {{does not}} release any sales figures for its Steam service; it only {{provides}} {{the data to}} companies with games on Steam, which they cannot release without permission because of a non-disclosure agreement with Valve. However, Stardock, the previous owner of competing platform Impulse, estimated that as of 2009, Steam had a 70% share of the digital distribution market for video games. In early 2011, Forbes reported that Steam sales constituted 50–70% of the [...] market for downloaded PC games and that Steam offered game producers gross margins of 70% of purchase price, compared with 30% at retail. Steam's success has led to some criticism because of its support of DRM and for being an effective monopoly. Free Software Foundation founder Richard Stallman commented on the issue following the announcement that Steam would come to Linux; he said that while he supposes that its release can boost GNU/Linux adoption leaving users better off than with Microsoft Windows, he stressed that he sees nothing wrong with commercial software but {{that the problem is}} that Steam is unethical for not being free software and that its inclusion in GNU/Linux distributions teaches the users that the <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> freedom and thus works against the software freedom that is his goal.|$|E
