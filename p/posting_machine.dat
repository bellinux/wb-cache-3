40|$|AbstractEquality sets of finite sets of homomorphisms are {{studied as}} part of formal {{language}} theory. Some particular equality sets, called Mergek(k-COPY), are investigated. These languages are combinatorially difficult, and are full semiAFL generators of the recursively enumerable sets, and are semiAFL generators of the class MULTI-RESET, provided k ⩾ 3. To accomplish this characterization, equality sets are related to multihead and multitape <b>Post</b> <b>machines</b> operating in real time. A <b>Post</b> <b>machine</b> has a one-way input tape and Post tapes as storage tapes, which in the multihead version are scanned {{from left to right}} by a write head and several read heads. By simulating <b>Post</b> <b>machines</b> by multiple reset machines, and vice versa, several new characterisations of the class MULTI-RESET are obtained, and it is shown that for multihead and multitape <b>Post</b> <b>machines</b> linear time is no more powerful than real time, and two Post tapes or, alternatively, three heads on one Post tape are as powerful as any finite number of heads or tapes.

40|$|We {{establish}} a lower bound of $ 2 ^n$ conditional branches for deciding the satisfiability of the conjunction of any two Boolean formulas from a set called a full representation of Boolean functions of $n$ variables - a set containing a Boolean formula to represent each Boolean function of $n$ variables. The contradiction proof first assumes that {{there exists a}} <b>Post</b> <b>machine</b> (<b>Post's</b> Formulation 1) that correctly decides the satisfiability of the conjunction of any two Boolean formulas from such a set by following an execution path that includes fewer than $ 2 ^n$ conditional branches. By using multiple runs of this <b>Post</b> <b>machine,</b> with one run for each Boolean function of $n$ variables, the proof derives a contradiction by showing that this <b>Post</b> <b>machine</b> is unable to correctly decide the satisfiability of the conjunction {{of at least one}} pair of Boolean formulas from a full representation of $n$-variable Boolean functions if the machine executes fewer than $ 2 ^n$ conditional branches. This lower bound of $ 2 ^n$ conditional branches holds for any full representation of Boolean functions of $n$ variables, even if a full representation consists solely of minimized Boolean formulas derived by a Boolean minimization method. We discuss why the lower bound fails to hold for satisfiability of certain restricted formulas, such as 2 CNF satisfiability, XOR-SAT, and HORN-SAT. We also relate the lower bound to 3 CNF satisfiability. The lower bound does not depend on sequentiality of access to the boxes in the symbol space and will hold even if a machine is capable of non-sequential access.

40|$|A {{method for}} making a glass-to-metal seal is described. A domed metal {{enclosure}} having a machined seal ring is fitted to a glass <b>post</b> <b>machined</b> to a slight taper and to a desired surface finish. The metal part is then heated by induction in a vacuum. As the metal part heats and expands relative to the glass post, the metal seal ring, possessing a higher coefficient of expansion than the glass post, slides down the tapered post. Upon cooling, the seal ring crushes against the glass post forming the seal. The method results in a glass-to-metal seal possessing extremely good leak resistance, while the parts are kept clean and free of the contaminants...|$|R

The research reported here concentrates on DLD process and focuses on machining investigation, e. g. cutting speed and tool wear.
