5000|$|Modern beveled {{glass is}} machine made. The {{automation}} of this traditionally hand made craft was {{facilitated by the}} development of plastic based metal deburring wheels which provided adequate smoothing of the ground glass face without the difficulties involved with traditional aluminum oxide and natural sandstone smoothing stones. The best natural smoothing stones came from a quarry in Newcastle, England and would be round wheels with a central hole several feet in diameter and 8" [...] thick. The stone's quality was dictated by the consistency of the sandstone, as any imperfection would scratch the glass being smoothed. These large stones would smooth the rough scratches created by the grinding process. The type of grinding and smoothing equipment depended upon whether one was creating straight line, outside or inside curved bevels. Outside curves and straight lines are ground on a flat rotating platter covered in a thin slurry of silicon carbide and water. Inside curves were ground on a silicon carbide grinding wheel of appropriate grit with water running on the wheel. Smoothing the ground face was done using the Newcastle stone for outside curves and straight line bevels and a cone shaped <b>polishing</b> <b>wheel</b> of relatively fine grit aluminum oxide. Despite the advantages of the plastic smoothing wheels, the crispness of the bevel edge is superior on the stone smoothed traditionally beveled pieces and can distinguish hand made beveled glass. The final step was polishing the beveled face using a felt covered wheel with a slurry of water and optical polishing powder. It was not uncommon to have pieces with a combination of outside and inside curve as well as straight line bevels. The objective was to have an even bevel width, even edge thickness with no facets in the bevel face and a crisp bevel edge. In the early 1900s in USA it was not uncommon to see beveled oval door glass 5' in length with 2" [...] wide bevels on 3/8" [...] thick plate glass. Creating such bevels required two craftsmen working as a team.|$|E

Different combinations of finishing wheels {{and polishing}} wheels are tested to optimize their selection.

The performance of the <b>polishing</b> <b>wheel</b> is the key for a good final surface quality.

The PPP machine exploits this insight and utilizes an oblique grinding technique that obviates the traditional trade-off between MRR and planarization efficiency. High speed grinding with cubic boron nitride (CBN) wheels are industrially attractive options for hard-to-machine metallic alloys, due to their low cost, reliability, reduced thermal damage and superior workpiece surface finish. However, thermal issues and transient behavior of the grinding wheel wear directly affect the workpiece surface integrity and tolerances. This thesis investigates the topological evolution of an electroplated CBN grinding wheel, characterization of its wear and life expectancy, when utilized in nickel-based alloy grinding. Depth profiling, digital microscopy and scanning electron microscopy are utilized to investigate topological evolution and mechanisms of grit failure. The results are used to elucidate the statistical evolution of the grinding wheel surface. It is found that when a grit is pulled out, load redistribution commences in its neighboring domain, with localized rapid grit wear. The unique experimental findings are used to develop a novel phenomenological model for the progressive wheel wear, including the combination of grit pullout (Stage I) and grit wear (Stage II). For Stage-I, the model employs the grinding kinematics, thermal shock to the grit-wheel interface, Paris law type fatigue approach. For Stage-II, Preston type wear approach is employed. The molding framework is utilized to infer electroplated CBN grinding wheels’ life expectancy for the high speed grinding and high efficiency deep grinding (HEDG) processes. The model provides the process design domain for different grinding process parameters, while maintaining a targeted wheel life, and averting potential damage of the workpiece...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRecent {{research}} has shown that a phase transformation of the diamond to a different form of carbon is involved when diamonds are polished in the traditional fashion. The question as to how this phase transformation is activated and maintained to produce high wear rates is of great technological interest since it may radically change the way we view the processing of diamond. This paper describes the use of Raman spectroscopy to examine debris produced on the diamond <b>polishing</b> <b>wheel,</b> both during its preparation and during polishing. In addition, polished diamond surfaces were examined for the possible existence of non-diamond surface layers in an attempt to identify material removal mechanisms. Raman spectroscopy proves ideal for these analyses because its relatively high spatial resolution is well suited to the analysis of small wear features and debris particles, and because of the wealth of information it reveals about chemical structure. This level of structural information has been lacking in previous analyses of diamond polishing debris. In addition to the non-diamond carbon found in the wear debris, significant quantities of two iron oxides – magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and hematite (α-Fe 2 O 3) were also found. An interesting observation was that a transformation from magnetite to hematite could be induced either by using high power laser excitation, or by frictional heating during polishing. It is suggested that some of the Raman peaks previously attributed to lonsdaleite might better be explained by the presence of these oxides...|$|E
