Its two largest and most visible schools are the Srikula (family of Sri), strongest in South India, and the Kalikula (family of Kali), which prevails in northern and eastern India.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{generators}} {{mounted on}} each of the E-3's four engines provide the one megawatt of electrical <b>power</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> required by the E-3's radars and other electronics. Its pulse-Doppler radar (PD) has a range of more than 250mi (400km) for low-flying targets at its operating altitude, and the pulse (BTH) radar has a range of approximately 400mi (650km) for aircraft flying at medium to high altitudes. The radar, combined with an SSR, and electronic support measures (ESM), provides a look down capability, to detect, identify, and track low-flying aircraft, while eliminating ground clutter (radar) returns.|$|E

5|$|Within a {{few years}} of the end of World War II, the United States {{deactivated}} all of its remaining battleships and placed them in the United States Navy reserve fleets. Most of these ships were eventually scrapped, but the four Iowa-class battleships were not, and on several occasions {{one or more of these}} four battleships were reactivated for naval gunfire support. The U.S. Navy has held onto the four Iowa-class battleships long after the upkeep and maintenance of operating and maintaining a battleship and the arrival of aircraft and precision guided munitions led other nations to scrap their big-gun fleets. Congress was largely responsible for keeping the four Iowa-class battleships in the United States Navy reserve fleets and on the Naval Vessel Register as long as they did. The lawmakers argued that the battleships' large-caliber guns had a useful destructive <b>power</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> lacking in the smaller, cheaper, and faster guns mounted by U.S. cruisers and destroyers.|$|E

25|$|Insertion loss: The {{transformers}} themselves commonly reduce {{total power}} {{applied to the}} loudspeakers, requiring the amplifier to be some ten to twenty percent {{more powerful than the}} total <b>power</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> intended to be applied to the loudspeakers. Typical transformer insertion loss measurements are taken at 1,000 Hz {{in order to make the}} transformer's specifications appear as good as possible. Using this method, typical insertion losses are about 1 dB, a 20% power loss. Unfortunately, most of the power in voice-application audio systems is below 400 Hz, meaning that insertion loss at lower frequencies would be greater. The best transformers reduce mid-band frequencies by 0.5 dB (approximately 10% power loss) or less, resulting in a ten watt loudspeaker drawing 11.1 watts from the amplifier.|$|E
25|$|Fractals are {{different}} from other geometric figures {{because of the way}} in which they scale. Doubling the edge lengths of a polygon multiplies its area by four, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old side length) raised to the power of two (the dimension of the space the polygon resides in). Likewise, if the radius of a sphere is doubled, its volume scales by eight, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old radius) to the power of three (the dimension that the sphere resides in). But if a fractal's one-dimensional lengths are all doubled, the spatial content of the fractal scales by a <b>power</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not necessarily an integer. This power is called the fractal dimension of the fractal, and it usually exceeds the fractal's topological dimension.|$|E
500|$|The {{transformative}} {{power of}} the song was investigated by journalist Bill Moyers in a documentary released in 1990. Moyers was inspired {{to focus on the}} song's power after watching a performance at Lincoln Center, where the audience consisted of Christians and non-Christians, and he noticed that it had an equal impact on everybody in attendance, unifying them. James Basker also acknowledged this force when he explained why he chose [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] to represent a collection of anti-slavery poetry: [...] "there is a transformative <b>power</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> applicable... : the transformation of sin and sorrow into grace, of suffering into beauty, of alienation into empathy and connection, of the unspeakable into imaginative literature." ...|$|E

500|$|Haas {{notes the}} absence of any {{suggestion}} of physical bases of <b>power,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> defensive construction. There is no evidence of warfare [...] "of any kind or at any level during the Preceramic Period". Mutilated bodies, burned buildings, and other tell-tale signs of violence are absent, and settlement patterns are completely non-defensive. The evidence of the development of complex government in {{the absence of}} warfare is in marked contrast to archaeological theory, which suggests that human beings move away from kin-based groups to larger units resembling [...] "states" [...] for mutual defense of often scarce resources. A vital resource was present: arable land generally, and the cotton crop specifically, but the move to greater complexity was apparently not driven by the need for defense or warfare.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{revolves}} around a {{central theme of}} language—written and spoken, truth and myth—and the power inherent {{in all of its}} forms, a <b>power</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> often only present in the deconstruction of communication. González Echevarria argues that [...] "Dr. Francia's fear of the pasquinade, his abuse of [...] his constant worry about writing all stem from {{the fact that he has}} found and used the power implicit in language itself. The Supreme defines power as being able to do through others what we are unable to do ourselves: language, being separate from what it designates, is the very embodiment of power, for things act and mean through it without ceasing to be themselves. Dr. Francia has also realized that he cannot control language, particularly written language, that it has a life of its own that threatens him." ...|$|E
500|$|Both Domingo Faustino Sarmiento's Facundo and José Marmol's Amalia, {{published}} in the nineteenth century, were precursors to the twentieth century dictator novel; however, [...] "all fictional depictions of the Latin American 'strong-man', have an important antecedent in Domingo Faustino Sarmiento's Facundo, a work written as a sociolodical treatise". Facundo is an indirect critique of Juan Manuel de Rosas's dictatorship, directed against the actual historical figure, Juan Facundo Quiroga, but is also a broader investigation into Argentine history and culture. Sarmiento's Facundo has remained a fundamental fixture because of the breadth of its literary exploration of the Latin American environment. In Facundo, Sarmiento criticizes the historical figure Facundo Quiroga, a provincial caudillo, who like Rosas (dictator of Argentina from 1829 to 1853) was opposed to the enlightened ideas of progress. After returning from exile, Sarmiento worked to reinvent Argentina, eventually becoming president himself from 1868 to 1874. Sarmiento's analysis of Facundo Quiroga {{was the first time}} that an author questioned how figures like Facundo and Rosas could have maintained such absolute power, and in answering this question, Facundo established its place as an inspirational text to later authors. Sarmiento perceived his own power in writing Facundo as [...] "within the text of the novel, it is the novelist, through the voice of omniscience, who has replaced God", thereby creating the bridge between writing and <b>power</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> characteristic of the dictator novel.|$|E
