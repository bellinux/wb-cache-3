40|$|IntroductionAcute {{arterial}} thrombosis causes endothelial dysfunction due to decreased {{nitric oxide}} bioactivity. Increased arginase activity may modulate intracellular L-arginine levels, the substrate for nitric oxide. The {{purpose of this}} study was to identify the role of arginase in endothelial dysfunction in cell culture and in the vasomotor response of arteries exposed to thrombus. MethodsRat aortic endothelial cells were exposed to thrombin at different time points. The cell extract was analyzed by immunoblotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Adult male rats underwent infrarenal aortic thrombosis by clip ligature for 1 hour. Infrarenal aortic <b>ring</b> <b>segments</b> were harvested and placed in physiologic buffer baths, and a force transducer was used to measure endothelial-dependent relaxation (EDR) and endothelial-independent relaxation (EIR). Arginase blockade was performed by incubating infrarenal aortic <b>ring</b> <b>segments</b> with arginase inhibitors for 1 hour before measuring EDR. Whole tissue extracts also underwent immunoblot analysis. The EDR and EIR curves were compared with analyses of variance. ResultsA 6. 76 ± 1. 4 -fold induction in arginase I message levels (P =. 001) was found in rat aortic endothelial cells exposed to thrombin (30 U/mL), and arginase I protein levels increased 2. 1 times. The eight infrarenal aortic <b>ring</b> <b>segments</b> exposed to thrombosis for 1 hour had diminished EDR curves compared with 14 nonthrombosed normal segments (controls). The maximum (± SEM) EDR (acetylcholine 10 − 5 M dose) in control infrarenal aortic <b>ring</b> <b>segments</b> was 108 % ± 4. 3 % compared with 63 % ± 6. 2 % for thrombosed infrarenal aortic <b>ring</b> <b>segments</b> (P <. 001). Exposure to arterial thrombosis resulted in a 3. 8 -times increase in arginase I protein levels in infrarenal aortic <b>ring</b> <b>segments.</b> Preincubation of nine infrarenal aortic <b>ring</b> <b>segments</b> with the nonspecific (difluoromethylornithine) and six with specific ([S]-[2 -boronoethyl]-L-Cysteine-HCl [BEC]) arginase inhibitor for 1 hour significantly increased the maximum EDR compared with untreated thrombosed segments (104 ± 5. 2, 108 ± 7. 6 vs 63 % ± 6. 2, P <. 001). EDR curves for difluoromethylornithine- and BEC-treated infrarenal aortic <b>ring</b> <b>segments</b> were superimposed on control EDR curves. The EIR and the vasoconstriction with norepinephrine for all groups were similar. ConclusionEndothelial cells exposed to thrombin have increased arginase I messenger RNA and protein levels. Arterial thrombosis causes endothelial dysfunction without affecting smooth muscle responsiveness. Arginase blockade can lead to normalization of arterial vasomotor function. Clinical relevanceAcute arterial thrombosis may lead to endothelial dysfunction, manifested clinically by vasospasm and rethrombosis after initially successful thrombectomy or thrombolysis. We have identified that the key enzyme, arginase, which modulates levels of the nitric oxide precursor, L-arginine, is increased in arterial thrombosis. Thrombin, a component of thrombus, increases arginase levels, which may lead to decreased nitric oxide bioavailability. These studies indicate that arginase blockade restores endothelial function in arteries exposed to thrombosis. This work may lead to therapeutic alternatives including L-arginine supplementation or arginase blockade for patients with acute ischemia...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the oldest}} science {{problems}} - possibility of the perpetuum mobile is discussed. The interest to this problem was provoke a result, published in J. Low Temp. Phys. 112, 227 (1998); cond-mat/ 9811148, which contradicts to the second law of thermodynamics. According to this result, the thermal fluctuations can induce a voltage with direct component in a inhomogeneous superconducting ring at an unaltered temperature corresponded to the resistive transition of the <b>ring</b> <b>segment</b> with the lowest critical temperature. This result arises from obvious statements: 1) the switching of a <b>ring</b> <b>segment</b> l_b {{into and out of}} the normal state, while the rest of the <b>ring</b> (<b>segment</b> l_a) remains superconducting, can induced a voltage with dc component (It is shown that, in spite of the wide spread opinion, this statement is correct because the superconductivity is a macroscopic quantum phenomena); 2) the thermal fluctuations switch the mesoscopic <b>ring</b> <b>segment</b> l_b with lowest critical temperature T_sb {{into and out of the}} normal state at T ≃ T_sb, while the rest of the ring remains superconducting if T_sa > T ≃ T_sb.

It is shown that from two type of the perpetuum mobile, only type "b" and only in quantum systems is possible. According to the presented interpretation, the total entropy, as the measure of the chaos, may be systematically reduced in some quantum system because a "switching" between the classical and quantum mechanics is possible.

Objective: To compare visual, refractive, and corneal aberrometric outcomes in keratoconic eyes implanted with intracorneal <b>ring</b> <b>segments</b> (ICRS) implantation using either a mechanical or a femtosecond laser-assisted procedure. Design: Retrospective, consecutive case series. Participants: A total of 146 consecutive eyes of 106 patients with the diagnosis of keratoconus (68 unilateral and 39 bilateral) were included. Two groups were created according to the surgical technique used for corneal tunnelization: Mechanical group (mechanical tunnelization, 63 eyes) and Femtosecond group (femtosecond laser-assisted tunnelization, 83 eyes). Intracorneal <b>ring</b> <b>segments</b> implantation was indicated because {{of the existence of}} reduced best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) or contact lens intolerance. Methods: Intracorneal <b>ring</b> <b>segments</b> implantations were performed by 6 surgeons following the same protocol except for the incision location. A total of 55 eyes were implanted with Intacs (Addition Technology, Inc, Fremont, CA) and 8 eyes were implanted with KeraRings (Mediphacos, Belo Horizonte, Brazil) in the Mechanical group, and 25 eyes were implanted with Intacs and 58 eyes were implanted with KeraRings in the Femtosecond group. Mean follow-up was 10. 66 ± 8. 20 months, ranging from 1 month to 24 months. Main Outcome Measures: Uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), BSCVA, refraction, keratometry, and root mean square (RMS) for different kinds of corneal aberrations. Results: By reporting only for statistically significant changes, UCVA improved in both groups at 6 months (P≤ 0. 02) and BSCVA improved in the Femtosecond group (P 0. 63, P≤ 0. 04). Conclusions: Intracorneal <b>ring</b> <b>segments</b> implantation using both mechanical and femtosecond laser-assisted procedures provide similar visual and refractive outcomes.
