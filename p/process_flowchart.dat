50|$|This {{neuroscience}} tool {{was incorporated}} into the HPM method for its numerous applications: (a) defining a process, (b) standardizing a process, (c) communicating a process, (d) identifying bottlenecks or waste in a process, (e) solving a problem, and (f) improving a <b>process.</b> <b>Flowcharts</b> provide a useful and straightforward visual reference for all members of an organization. Utilizing <b>flowcharts</b> offers increased <b>process</b> transparency and decreased ambiguity, often resulting in an increase to overall workplace efficiency.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{there are}} several of these classifications. For example, Andrew Veronis (1978) named three basic types of flowcharts: the system flowchart, the general flowchart, and the {{detailed}} flowchart. That same year Marilyn Bohl (1978) stated [...] "in practice, two kinds of flowcharts are used in solution planning: system flowcharts and program flowcharts...". More recently Mark A. Fryman (2001) stated {{that there are more}} differences: [...] "Decision flowcharts, logic flowcharts, systems flowcharts, product <b>flowcharts,</b> and <b>process</b> <b>flowcharts</b> {{are just a few of}} the different types of flowcharts that are used in business and government".|$|R

40|$|The aim {{of process}} mining is to {{identify}} and extract process patterns from data logs to reconstruct an overall <b>process</b> <b>flowchart.</b> As business processes {{become more and more}} complex {{there is a need for}} managers to understand the processes they already have in place. To undertake such a task manually would be extremely time consuming so the practice of process mining attempts to automatically reconstruct the correct representation of a process based on a set of process execution traces. This paper outlines an alternative approach to business process mining utilising a Genetic Programming (GP) technique coupled with a graph based representation. The graph based representation allows greater flexibility in the analysis of <b>process</b> <b>flowchart</b> structure and offers the possibility of mining complex business processes from incomplete or problematic event logs. A number of event logs have been mined by the GP technique featured in this paper and the results of the experimentation point towards the potential of this novel process mining approach...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} has explored environmental sustainability related literature and has performed {{a case study}} analysis on a timber and building material wholesale company relating to its environmental aspects. Published work focuses on either environmental management systems (EMS) or environmental performance evaluation (EPE). The integration of these two aspects has not been paid sufficient attention. It {{is important to consider}} the integration between EMS and EPE in pursuing environmental sustainability. This can be achieved by adopting a systematic approach and developing and applying a suitable EPE model. Balanced Scorecard (BSC) is a well applied performance evaluation and improvement approach. Some applications of BSC have been made to evaluate the overall sustainability performance, where environmental sustainability has been taken into consideration, but not the sole focus. Therefore, this {{research has}} generated a <b>process</b> <b>flowchart</b> framework which can be used for companies to achieve environmental sustainability. An environmental BSC model with identified environmental strategic objectives is also developed in this research. The links of these environmental strategic objectives across different levels are illustrated in an environmental strategic mapping.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the modification {{of an existing}} process configuration train for Bio-SNG production using an indirectly-heated circulating fluidized bed gasifier. Taking the process design of the Gothenburg Biomass Gasification (GoBiGas) project, we investigate four modifications to the process design in order to analyze what the potential effect from implementation of the results from state-of-the-art research activities on bio-syngas conversion is. Firstly, aromatic compounds are converted into Bio-SNG. Secondly, olefin hydration and hydrodesulfurization units are combined in a high-temperature hydrodesulfurization unit. Thirdly, the methanation section is modified and the pre-reformer unit in the syngas conditioning section is eliminated. Finally, H 2 S and CO 2 removal are combined in the same unit. In order to provide a comprehensive comparison of current GoBiGas process and the configuration investigated in this work, <b>process</b> <b>flowcharts</b> and energy and material balances are provided.

40|$|A {{product or}} system {{development}} {{process is a}} kind of complex system, arguably even more complex than the system it produces. Yet, the models and tools used by systems engineers and program managers to plan and manage technical work—such as <b>process</b> <b>flowcharts,</b> Gantt charts, work breakdown structures, and text-rendered procedures—are less sophisticated and capable than the ones used to design the product system. When used, the various process models are often challenged to incorporate and maintain synchronized program informa-tion—e. g., they may be created by different subgroups in a program and based on different assumptions, and they may diverge as a program proceeds. Recently, architecture frameworks (AFs) have been used to help manage the complexity in engineered systems. An AF provides a portfolio of views of a complex system, each of which describes it partially and in a format meaningful to its users and their particular needs. This paper proposes the application of AF concepts to the management of the work done to develop a complex system product. The pieces of work and their relationships constitute a complex process. A portfolio of integrated and synchronized views of a single process model would seem to be preferable to the current state—a number of disparate and uncoordinated management models. This paper introduces a new application of AFs to development processes and suggests this area as one for furthe...|$|R

40|$|Stimulated by {{the success}} of {{management}} innovation in the manufacturing industry – culminating in lean production, many homebuilders attempt to model the construction process on manufacturing. Currently, much of the focus has been on the use of factory-built structural components, which reflects the inherent characteristics of the residential construction industry that medium and large homebuilders construct high volumes of houses with a similar structure. However, many such attempts failed due to operation management problems. This paper presents a hybrid approach that combines process flowcharting and simulation for helping prefabricators analyze and improve their production process. In the research, the <b>process</b> <b>flowchart</b> and process activity chart are used to identify opportunities for process improvement, and simulation models are built in Simphony, a Special Purpose Simulation (SPS) tool, to do what-if analysis and to predict productivity.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we report on}} a new {{technique}} to attain superhydrophilicity in high aspect ratio through-silicon vias (TSVs) for void-free and uniform copper electroplating. Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) is used to deposit a conformal layer of TiN {{on the surface of}} a silicon substrate and onto the sidewalls of vias etched in this substrate. A superhydrophilic film is obtained by oxidizing the TiN in oxygen plasma and by exposing the oxidized TiN to UV light. This results in a decrease of the contact angle to 5 ° and even lower. Next, the superhydrophilic material is integrated in a <b>process</b> <b>flowchart</b> for high aspect ratio TSVs. For the electrical characterization cross-Kelvin structures were fabricated and connected {{on both sides of the}} wafer by a bottom-up copper electroplating technique. The obtained TSVs exhibit a low average resistance of 50 mO, which is very suitable for RF signal transmission. The low thermal budget of the ALD process and the solely dry technology employed to achieve the superhydrophilicity, make the developed process suitable for integration in via-last flowchart schemes for advanced 3 D interconnects...|$|E

40|$|Technological {{advancement}} {{and demand}} for economic growth are driving product innovation in the construction industry. However there is concern that the industry lacks the mechanisms to effectively implement new products. Recent studies have developed a method for identifying and evaluating the risks which impact on new technology adoption and two constructs were generated for improving implementation rates. The aim is to investigate whether the constructs can be integrated to develop a practical tool for use by project stakeholders desirous to generate innovation. Process modelling, statistical analysis and failure mode and effect analysis are used to align the constructs into a test model (TM). Three rounds of Delphi gain a consensus on the TM outputs and the results produce the innovation management model (IMM). The IMM is a simple <b>process</b> <b>flowchart</b> which establishes the prioritized sequence of stakeholder activities required to implement a new technology at key stages in the project process. The IMM has implications for selection of procurement methods and will instil confidence in stakeholders to adopt new technologies.

40|$|International audienceRNAi using siRNA {{is a very}} {{powerful}} tool for functional genomics to identify new drug targets and biological pathways. Although their use in epithelial cells is relatively easy and straightforward, transfection in other cell types is still challenging. The authors report the optimization of transfection conditions for Raw 267. 4 macrophage cells. The herein described procedure makes use of automated confocal microscopy, enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) -expressing macrophages, and fluorescently labeled siRNAs to simultaneously quantify both siRNA uptake and silencing efficiency. A comparison of 10 commercial transfectants was performed, leading to the selection of the transfectant giving the highest reproducible knock-down effect without inducing cell toxicity or cell activation. Several buffers used for siRNA/lipid complex assembly were tested, and such a study revealed the crucial importance of this parameter. In addition, a kinetics study led to the determination of the optimal siRNA concentration and the best time window for the assay. In an original approach aimed at simultaneously optimizing both the high-throughput screening process and biological factors, optimal reagent volumes and a <b>process</b> <b>flowchart</b> were defined to ensure robust silencing efficiencies during screening. Such an account should pave the way for future genome-wide RNAi research in macrophages and present an optimization procedure for other "hard-totransfect" cell lines...|$|E
40|$|Low Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) {{and high}} levels of {{uncertainty}} make it challenging to develop cost estimates of new technologies in the R&D phase. It is however essential for NASA to understand the costs and benefits associated with novel concepts, in order to prioritize research investments and evaluate the potential for technology transfer and commercialization. This paper proposes a framework to perform a cost-benefit analysis of a technology in the R&D phase. This framework was developed and used to assess the Advanced Near Net Shape Technology (ANNST) manufacturing process for fabricating integrally stiffened cylinders. The ANNST method was compared with the conventional multi-piece metallic construction and composite processes for fabricating integrally stiffened cylinders. Following the definition of a case study for a cryogenic tank cylinder of specified geometry, data was gathered through interviews with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), with particular focus placed on production costs and process complexity. This data served as the basis to produce <b>process</b> <b>flowcharts</b> and timelines, mass estimates, and rough order-of-magnitude cost and schedule estimates. The scalability of the results was subsequently investigated to understand the variability of the results based on tank size. Lastly, once costs and benefits were identified, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to assess the relative value of these achieved benefits for potential stakeholders. These preliminary, rough order-of-magnitude results predict a 46 to 58 percent reduction in production costs and a 7 -percent reduction in weight over the conventional metallic manufacturing technique used in this study for comparison. Compared to the composite manufacturing technique, these results predict cost savings of 35 to 58 percent; however, the ANNST concept was heavier. In this study, the predicted return on investment of equipment required for the ANNST method was ten cryogenic tank barrels when compared with conventional metallic manufacturing. The AHP study results revealed that decreased final cylinder mass and improved quality assurance were the most valued benefits of cylinder manufacturing methods, therefore emphasizing the relevance of the benefits achieved with the ANNST process for future projects...|$|R
