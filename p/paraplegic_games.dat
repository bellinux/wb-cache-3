500|$|In 1963, the SARB {{took the}} step of {{copyrighting}} the Springbok emblem and Springbok colours as a badge under the Heraldry Act to pre-empt any other sporting body copyrighting it. The board initially declared, it {{was happy to}} share the Springbok colours providing that they were only awarded to white amateur sportspeople representing South Africa internationally. It was also an attempt to try and stop the South Africa national rugby league team from using the colours, though Rugby League South Africa circumvented this by developing {{their own version of}} the Springbok colours. Later legislation in 1971 was passed in order to enforce apartheid so that only white South Africans could be awarded Springbok colours though this later extended to those deemed as [...] "honorary whites". This came after three black Africans were awarded Springbok colours for competing in the World <b>Paraplegic</b> <b>Games.</b> Later {{as a result of the}} legislation, Glen Popham was not awarded Springbok colours following winning a gold medal in Karate in the 1969 South African Games alongside his white team, as his race was officially classified as Coloured which the South African National Olympic Committee were not aware of prior. As non-whites were not eligible to be selected for South African national sports teams, the Springbok colours came to be viewed as a symbol of white supremacy in apartheid South Africa because they were only awarded to white sportspeople.|$|E
