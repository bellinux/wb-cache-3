We start from quantitative issues (progressive quantities of agrifood <b>product</b> <b>exchanges)</b> to qualitative ones (with reference to the balance level), deducting the knowledge of policies on product quality in the market competitiveness. On such basis may be configured exchanges and twodimensional involvements of the production volume ↔commercial agrifood <b>product</b> <b>exchanges...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a semantic-mediation architecture that enables standards-based interoperability between heterogeneous supply-chain applications. The architecture was implemented using a state-of-the-art semantic-mediation toolset for design-time and run-time integration tasks. The design-time tools supported a domain ontology definition, message annotations, message schema transformations, and reconciliation rules specifications. The run-time tools performed <b>exchanges,</b> transformations, and <b>reconciliations</b> of the <b>messages.</b> The architecture supports a supply-chain integration scenario where heterogeneous automotive manufacturing supply-chain applications exchange inventory information.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is the {{analysis}} of fishery <b>products</b> <b>exchange</b> between the EU and its Mediterranean partners. In order to delineate more clearly the framework of trade in fish products among the Mediterranean countries, EU and non-EU members, countries under analysis (only those with a Mediterranean shore) will be divided into 4 groups:  PMM, EU Mediterranean members (France, Greece, Italy, Spain, Cyprus, Malta and Slovenia);  PCM, candidate Mediterranean countries (Croatia and Turkey);  PPCM, potential candidate Mediterranean countries (Albania and Montenegro);  PTM, third Mediterranean countries (Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Syria, Palestinian Authority and Tunisia). In addition to the more recent political agreements (enlargement processes and membership) the analysis will take into account the partnership processes involving the EU, on one hand, and some Mediterranean partners: the Euro - Mediterranean partnership (PEM) and the Stabilization and Association process (PSA) that the EU has launched with the countries of the Mediterranean south-east (from North Africa to the Middle-East) in the first case, and with the countries of south-eastern Europe (Balkans), in the second case. The study focuses on the fishery <b>products</b> <b>exchange</b> using, as sources, UN-Comtrade data (for the international trade) and Eurostat data (for the EU trade). The analysis will pay attention both on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of trade. From the analysis it is expected to identify the main trends of exchange, the effects of the liberalisation processes on the fish <b>products</b> <b>exchange</b> and any <b>product</b> specialisation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{reviews the}} {{development}} of the standards for access to external product libraries in relation to procurement and <b>product</b> data <b>exchange.</b> Procurement accounts for 70 - 85 % of the value of a building project and hence it is vitally important for the data exchange required to support these processes to be streamlined. <b>Product</b> data <b>exchange</b> between applications is equally important for streamlining the specification, design and construction and maintenance of a building facility. A considerable amount of effort within the Architecture/Engineering/Construction and Facilities Management (A/E/C/FM) has gone into developing standards for <b>product</b> data <b>exchange.</b> Manufacturers and suppliers have supported {{the development of}} procurement related standards. With the developments in XML-based standards the technology is now available for developing cost-effective solutions that meet the requirements of both procurement and <b>product</b> data <b>exchange.</b> The paper evaluates the existing and emerging standards and discusses the issues arising from the development of standards for access to product libraries and possible ways forward. ...|$|R
