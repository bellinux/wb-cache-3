40|$|Emotionally {{negative}} stimuli {{serve as}} a mechanism of biological preparedness to enhance attention. We hypothesized that emotionally negative stimuli would also serve as motivational priming to increase attention resources for subsequent stimuli. To that end, we tested 11 participants in a dual sensory modality task, wherein emotionally negative pictures were contrasted with emotionally neutral pictures and each picture was followed 600 ms later by a tone in an auditory oddball paradigm. Each trial began with a picture displayed for 200 ms; half of the trials began with an emotionally negative picture {{and half of the}} trials began with an emotionally neutral picture; 600 ms following picture presentation, the participants heard either an oddball tone or a standard tone. At the end of each trial (<b>picture</b> followed by <b>tone),</b> the participants categorized, with a button press, the <b>picture</b> and <b>tone</b> combination. As expected, and consistent with previous studies, we found an enhanced visual late positive potential (latency range= 300 - 700 ms) to the negative picture stimuli. We further found that compared to neutral pictures, negative pictures resulted in early attention and orienting effects to subsequent tones (measured through an enhanced N 1 and N 2) and sustained attention effects only to the subsequent oddball tones (measured through late processing negativity, latency range= 400 - 700 ms). Number pad responses to both the <b>picture</b> and <b>tone</b> category showed the shortest response latencies and greatest percentage of correct picture-tone categorization on the negative picture followed by oddball tone trials. Consistent with previous work on natural selective attention, our results support the idea that emotional stimuli can alter attention resource allocation. This finding has broad implications for human attention and performance as it specifically shows the conditions in which an emotionally negative stimulus can result in extended stimulus evaluation...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{demonstrate}} {{a solution to}} use cameras to download data to cell phones {{as an alternative to}} existing wireless (CDMA/GPRS, BlueTooth), infrared or cable connections.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{the current}} climate of {{increasing}} awareness, patients are demanding more knowledge about forthcoming operations. The patient information accounts for a considerable part of the physician's daily clinical routine. Unfortunately, {{only a small percentage}} of the information is understood by the patient after solely verbal elucidation. To optimise information delivery, different auxiliary materials are used. METHODS: In a prospective study, 52 consecutive stationary patients, scheduled for an elective lumbar disc operation were asked to use a web-based audiovisual patient information system. A combination of <b>pictures,</b> text, <b>tone</b> and video about the planned surgical intervention is installed on a tablet personal computer presented the day before surgery. All patients were asked to complete a questionnaire. RESULTS: Eighty-four percent of all participants found that the audiovisual patient information system lead to a better understanding of the forthcoming operation. Eighty-two percent found that the information system was a very helpful preparation before the pre-surgical interview with the surgeon. Ninety percent of all participants considered it meaningful to provide this kind of preoperative education also to patients planned to undergo other surgical interventions. Eighty-four percent were altogether "very content" with the audiovisual patient information system and 86...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{describe}} a novel data transfer scheme {{that uses the}} camera in a smart phone as an alternative data channel. The data is encoded as a sequence of 2 -D barcode images, displayed on a flat panel display, acquired by the camera, and decoded in real time by the software embedded in device. The decoded data is written to a file. Compared with existing data channels, such as CDMA/GPRS, cables, Bluetooth, and Infrared, our method relies on visual communication and does not require special hardware or data plans. Users only need to point the camera at a monitor displaying the VCode to download. Technical challenges to overcome include correction of perspective distortion, compensation for contrast variation, and efficient implementation of small footprint software into a mobile device. We address these challenges and present our solution in detail. We have implemented a prototype which allows users to download various types of files successfully, including <b>pictures,</b> ring <b>tones</b> and Java games onto camera phones running Symbian and Windows Mobile platforms. We discuss the limitations of our solution and outline future work to overcome these limitations. Index Terms—Error correction coding., image processing, multimedia communication...|$|R
40|$|Most {{printers}} {{and some}} display devices are bilevel (black or white) {{and therefore not}} capable of reproducing continuous <b>tone</b> <b>pictures.</b> Digital halftoning algorithms transform digital gray scale images into bilevel ones which {{give the appearance of}} containing various shades of gray. A halftoning algorithm is presented in which novel concepts are combined resulting in an output image in which moirk patterns are suppressed and, at the same time, the edges are enhanced. Various other artifacts associated with the halftoning process, such as contouring due to coarse quantization or to textural changes, are also absent from the output images in the proposed scheme. The algorithm separates the image into many small clusters which are processed independently and, therefore, it is capable of parallel implementation. 1...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{electrophysiological}} {{studies have}} investigated {{the time course of}} semantic, syntactic, and phonological encoding in European language spoken production, such as English or Dutch. The present study investigated the time course of tonal and orthographic encoding during Chinese word production. Participants were shown pictures and carried out a dual-choice Go/noGo decision based on tonal information (whether a <b>picture</b> name was <b>tone</b> 1 or 2, or tone 3 or 4) or orthographic information (whether or not the picture name was written with a left-right structure character). Analyses of N 200 effects and LRPs (lateralized readiness potentials) indicated that tonal information was retrieved prior to orthographic information. These results imply that orthographic codes are unlikely to contribute to phonological encoding in spoken word production. Furthermore, a late effect for the N 200 in the Go/noGo=tone condition was observed, which may be related to internal self-monitoring of suprasegmental information.

5000|$|Rudy Rupak was 25 {{years old}} at the time he {{produced}} this film, making him Canada's youngest film producer at the time. The project was meant to be both a video game and movie. The film was directed by John Shepphird of Teenage Bonnie and Klepto Clyde fame. Rudy credits Quebec producer Claudio Castravelli and his company, Taurus 7, for rescuing the film on the first day of pre-production when the initial bank rejected Columbia Tri-Star's contract because at that point the company was changing ownership from a US company to becoming a part of Sony. The script, written by Rudy Rupak and James Salisko, was considered too edgy and made reference to things like X games and extreme sports. Columbia <b>Pictures</b> however <b>toned</b> down what would have been a PG-13 movie into a PG one given the pressures of an election year when Bob Dole was bent on chastising Hollywood for its alleged immorality. Scenes like peeing onto skiers from a chair lift, and skating on a blunt (marijuana) shaped board were scrapped. Rupak's efforts to sell a video game based on Snowboarding never materialized. Rudy Rupak went on to produce two other feature films including She's Too Tall and The Final Goal which was directed by Paul Kassar, the director of the Keifer Sutherland [...] "24".|$|R

In this method, the complexity of every pixel in picture is computed, then a neibourhood is defined to compute the complexity of every pixel, and then the complexity of every pixel is computed in the neibourhood. Placing data in the monotonous areas of halftone can explain the presence of hidden data. A method has been represented that surveys the position of every pixel neibouring others and prevents including in monotonous areas. If that was a complicated one, steganography bit after stonehalf will be hidden after scrolling the whole, the process of spreading error will be done.

30|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the transparency of the annotations, I nonetheless share Thompson’s (2014 : 64) notion of connecting the analysis to particular (strings of) words. Earlier, I defined a case of appraisal as a coherent unit of meaning that may consist of a phrase or a sentence; however, {{for the sake of}} clarity, it should not extend to multiple sentences or whole paragraphs. With too long units, there is an increased risk of ambiguity and over-interpretation; moreover some significant details might get ignored if the analysis only focused on the big <b>picture.</b> The overall <b>tone</b> of the text can be identified as generally positive or negative but determining how evaluation actually builds up within a text requires a much more focused approach. It is the level of wording where the evaluation is grounded, and the alternation and the dynamic between different types of appraisal is revealed by the systematic quantitative study of each instance.|$|R
50|$|Zespół Filmowy Xs first {{production}} {{was the second}} film of enfant terrible Andrzej Żuławski, Diabeł (The Devil). This film - a lavish and diabolically surrealistic depiction {{of the effects of}} the aftermath of the Kościuszko Uprising and the Third Partition of Poland on a once noble-family in a bleak, wintry Polish countryside - was met immediately with stern condemnation from the Polish cultural authorities. The film existed under a state of suppression until 1987, when the film was finally released after the hardline of the government softened due to increasing pressure from within to open the society. This <b>picture</b> set the <b>tone</b> for the bulk of Zespół Filmowy Xs output: challenging pictures with high artistic standards. The fallout from Diabełs suppression earned greater scrutiny for the team from the authorities, Żuławskis departure for France and a climate of relaxed control, and exclusion of the team from cinemas, which had the effect of relegating for a time all the teams production to television.|$|R

40|$|Does {{producing}} a word slow {{performance of a}} concurrent, unrelated task? In 2 experiments, 108 participants named <b>pictures</b> and discriminated <b>tones.</b> In Experiment 1, pictures were named after cloze sentences; the durations of the word-production stages of lemma and phonological word-form selection were manipulated with high- and low-constraint cloze sentences and high- and low-frequency-name pictures, respectively.

All manipulations, except the phoneme-selection manipulation, delayed tonediscrimination responses as much as picture-naming responses.
