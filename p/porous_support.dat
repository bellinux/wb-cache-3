In the case of DEAE-Sepharose CL- 6 B and histidine-immobilized agarose (Table  2), concentrations of LPS in the recovered solution were higher than those in the <b>porous</b> <b>supports</b> bearing lipid membranes.

30|$|Polymeric lipid {{membranes}} of N-octadecylchitosan, {{which consists}} of 70  mol% of 2 -(octadecylamino)- 2 -deoxy-d-glucopyranose, 17  mol% of 2 -amino- 2 -deoxy-d-glucopyranose, and 13  mol% of 2 -acetamido- 2 -deoxy-d-glucopyranose, were covalently immobilized to carboxylated <b>porous</b> <b>supports</b> composed of chitosan and used for the adsorption of pyrogenic lipopolysaccharide. When human serum albumin solution, including 5  mg mL- 1 of albumin and 5.6  ng mL- 1 of lipopolysaccharide, was passed through a column packed with the resulting <b>porous</b> <b>supports</b> bearing lipid membranes assembled in nanoscale, lipopolysaccharide was removed to as low as a detection limit of 0.020  ng mL- 1 with a quantitative recovery of protein. On the other hand, {{in the case of}} directly N-octadecylated <b>porous</b> <b>supports</b> having cationic and hydrophobic ligands which are not assembled as lipid membranes, lipopolysaccharide could not be removed to the detection limit and protein recovery was lower than the <b>porous</b> <b>supports</b> bearing lipid membranes. The difference above as well as difference from conventional adsorbents suggested that the selectivity was attributable to an interaction between the cationic lipid membranes of N-octadecylchitosan and lipopolysaccharide as well as protein. The <b>porous</b> <b>supports</b> bearing lipid membranes were stable in 0.5  M NaOH and 0.1  M HCl at ambient temperature.

50|$|This plastic is {{also used}} to produce air {{separation}} membranes for generating nitrogen. The PPO is spun into a hollow fiber membrane with a <b>porous</b> <b>support</b> layer and a very thin outer skin. The permeation of oxygen occurs from inside to out across the thin outer skin with an extremely high flux. Due to the manufacturing process, the fiber has excellent dimensional stability and strength. Unlike hollow fiber membranes made from polysulfone, the aging process of the fiber is relatively quick so that air separation performance remains stable throughout the life of the membrane. PPO makes the air separation performance suitable for low temperature (35-70F)(2-21C) applications where polysulfone membranes require heated air to increase permeation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Ionic liquids {{are widely}} used in {{supported}} ionic liquid membranes technology, especially in gas separation and purification processes. This work characterizes the ability of ionic liquids to wet commercially available <b>porous</b> <b>supports</b> used for such purposes. Characterization of supports and membrane phases {{was carried out in}} order to determine factors influencing wetting process. Experimental method based on capillary rise is widely used for porous media characterization (i. e. pore radius, contact angle). Measurements of penetration distance or liquid mass are two main experimental methods, in which the Washburn equation is a basic instrument to analyze the obtained results. However, polymeric <b>porous</b> <b>supports</b> do not meet Washburn assumptions and the method is loaded with human errors, so the sessile drop method was used. The rate of wetting influences swelling effects and therefore changes in permeation path during gas separation processes are observed. Influence of ionic liquids structure on wetting and swelling of <b>porous</b> <b>supports</b> was investigated. The families of 1 -alkyl- 3 -methylimidazolium (Cnmim), ammonium (Nnnnn), 1 -alkyl- 1 -methylpyrrolidinium (CnPyrr) and 1 -alkylpyridinium (CnPy) compounds with variable alkyl chain lengths in cation structures and changeable anions were taken into account in wetting and swelling experiments...|$|R

50|$|Agroinfiltration is {{a method}} used in plant biology and {{especially}} lately in plant biotechnology to induce transient expression of genes in a plant, or isolated leaves from a plant, or even in cultures of plant cells, {{in order to produce}} a desired protein. In the method a suspension of Agrobacterium tumefaciens is introduced into a plant leaf by direct injection or by vacuum infiltration, or brought into association with plant cells immobilised on a <b>porous</b> <b>support</b> (plant cell packs), whereafter the bacteria transfer the desired gene into the plant cells via transfer of T-DNA. The main benefit of agroinfiltration when compared to the more traditional plant transformation is speed and convenience, although yields of the recombinant protein are generally also higher and more consistent.|$|E
5000|$|Despite their {{excellent}} catalytic capabilities, enzymes {{and their}} properties must be improved prior to industrial implementation in many cases. Some aspects of enzymes {{that must be}} improved prior to implementation are stability, activity, inhibition by reaction products, and selectivity towards non-natural substrates. This may be accomplished through immobilization of enzymes on a solid material, such as a <b>porous</b> <b>support.</b> [...] Immobilization of enzymes greatly simplifies the recovery process, enhances process control, and reduces operational costs. Many immobilization techniques exist, such as adsorption, covalent binding, affinity, and entrapment. Ideal immobilization processes should not use highly toxic reagents in the immobilization technique to ensure stability of the enzymes. After immobilization is complete, the enzymes are introduced into a reaction vessel for biocatalysis.|$|E
50|$|Industrial {{applications}} of membranes require hundreds {{to thousands of}} square meters of membranes and therefore {{an efficient way to}} reduce the footprint by packing them is required. Membranes first became commercially viable when low cost methods of housing in ‘modules’ were achieved. Membranes are not self-supporting. They need to be stayed by a <b>porous</b> <b>support</b> that can withstand the pressures required to operate the NF membrane without hindering the performance of the membrane. To do this effectively, the module needs to provide a channel to remove the membrane permeation and provide appropriate flow condition that reduces the phenomena of concentration polarisation. A good design minimises pressure losses on both the feed side and permeate side and thus energy requirements. Leakage of the feed into the permeate stream must also be prevented. This can be done through either the use of permanent seals such as glue or replaceable seals such as O-rings.|$|E
30|$|Specific {{interaction}} for LPS of the <b>porous</b> <b>supports</b> bearing lipid membranes {{seems to}} be useful in a forthcoming issue. Antibody drugs with superior efficacy have been developed intensively {{in the last few}} decades. However, since they are produced by mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary, their cost is very expensive and needs to be reduced. For this issue, intensive researches have been continued for production of antibody drugs using microorganisms such as E. coli[17]. Although protein A chromatography is useful to recover antibody drugs from preparations, further chromatography is necessary to obtain the required purity for their clinical use. It is likely that production of antibody drugs by E. coli leads to a further requirement of selective removal of LPS. Considering the selectivity for LPS of the <b>porous</b> <b>supports</b> bearing lipid membranes, their application for purification of antibody drugs is interesting.|$|R
