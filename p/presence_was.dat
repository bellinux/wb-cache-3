40|$|<b>Presence</b> {{research}} <b>is</b> {{a rather}} new field within the scientific community. The term <b>presence</b> <b>is</b> still not defined {{once and for}} all {{and there are a lot}} of different approaches to choose from in order to measure the experience of presence. An interesting aspect of <b>presence</b> <b>is</b> if and how it is related to subjective duration. In this paper, we will present an experiment which we have conducted in order to find out how subjective duration and <b>presence</b> <b>are</b> related. We have found that <b>presence</b> <b>is</b> closely connected to the amount of concrete or abstract processing performed by an individual, that <b>presence</b> <b>is</b> highly subjective and that under certain conditions, when the subjective experience of presence increases, the experienced duration also increases...|$|R

5|$|During this period, Albin was {{involved}} in a political controversy regarding succession to an earldom. An alleged papal bull, dated 13 December 1255, had named Bishop Albin as a papal mandatory, along with Robert de Stuteville, with instructions to investigate Alan Durward's claim to the earldom of Mar; however, the bull was denounced as a forgery on 28 March 1257, after Durward's rivals had seized power. During the months preceding this denunciation, Albin was once again out of Scotland; on 4 March 1257 his <b>presence</b> <b>was</b> once again recorded at Durham.|$|E

5|$|President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who had {{recently}} returned from a diplomatic visit to the United Nations, visited {{the site of the}} explosion on August 7.

5|$|The {{area known}} as Croatia today was {{inhabited}} throughout the prehistoric period. Fossils of Neanderthals dating to the middle Palaeolithic period have been unearthed in northern Croatia, with the most famous and the best presented site in Krapina. Remnants of several Neolithic and Chalcolithic cultures were found in all regions of the country. The largest proportion of the sites is in the river valleys of northern Croatia, and the most significant cultures whose <b>presence</b> <b>was</b> discovered include Starčevo, Vučedol and Baden cultures. The Iron Age left traces of the early Illyrian Hallstatt culture and the Celtic La Tène culture.|$|E
5|$|The icy Galilean moons, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, all {{generate}} induced magnetic {{moments in}} response to changes in Jupiter's magnetic field. These varying magnetic moments create dipole magnetic fields around them, which act to compensate {{for changes in the}} ambient field. The induction is thought to take place in subsurface layers of salty water, which are likely to exist in all of Jupiter's large icy moons. These underground oceans can potentially harbor life, and evidence for their <b>presence</b> <b>was</b> {{one of the most important}} discoveries made in the 1990s by spacecraft.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the notion that}} <b>presence</b> may <b>be</b> considered as a selection mechanism that organizes the stream of sensory data into an environmental gestalt or perceptual hypothesis about current environment. A par-ticular environmental gestalt results in scan-sensing {{of the world in}} a particular pattern reminiscent of saccades and fixations in eye scan paths. The environment hypothesis is continually reverified or else a break in <b>presence</b> oc-curs. <b>Presence</b> <b>is</b> therefore compared to visual hypothe-sis selection in the work of Richard Gregory and Law-rence Stark. The implications for measurement are discussed, and it is concluded that physiological measures indicating breaks in <b>presence</b> <b>are</b> worthy of study, and that the study of <b>presence</b> <b>is</b> also the study of what maintains an environmental gestalt. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{supernova}} SN 1006 {{appeared in}} the southern constellation of Lupus during the year 1006 CE. This was the brightest recorded star ever {{to appear in the}} night sky, and its <b>presence</b> <b>was</b> noted in China, Egypt, Iraq, Italy, Japan and Switzerland. It may also have been noted in France, Syria, and North America. Egyptian physician, astronomer and astrologer Ali ibn Ridwan gave the brightness of this star as one-quarter the brightness of the Moon. Modern astronomers have discovered the faint remnant of this explosion and determined that it was only 7,100 light-years from the Earth.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} {{service in}} 1916, Provence {{and her sisters}} {{were assigned to the}} 1st Division of the 1st Battle Squadron, with Provence as the fleet flagship. The three ships remained in the unit {{for the remainder of the}} war. They spent the majority of their time at Corfu to prevent the Austro-Hungarian fleet from attempting to break out of the Adriatic. The fleet's <b>presence</b> <b>was</b> also intended to intimidate Greece, which had become increasingly hostile to the Triple Entente. Later in the war, men were drawn from their crews for anti-submarine warfare vessels. As the Austro-Hungarians largely remained in port for the duration of the war, Provence saw no action during the conflict. Indeed, she did not leave port at all for the entirety of 1917. In April 1919, she returned to Toulon. The French Navy intended to send the ship to the Black Sea to join operations against the Bolsheviks, but a major mutiny prevented the operation. She and Lorraine went to Constantinople in October 1919, where they formed the core of the Eastern Mediterranean Squadron.|$|E

5|$|After {{the border}} reopened, the British {{government}} reduced the {{military presence in}} Gibraltar by closing the naval dockyard. The RAF <b>presence</b> <b>was</b> also downgraded; although the airport officially remains an RAF base, military aircraft are no longer permanently stationed there. The British garrison, which had been present since 1704, was withdrawn in 1990 following defence cutbacks {{at the end of}} the Cold War. A number of military units continue to be stationed in Gibraltar under the auspices of British Forces Gibraltar; the garrison was replaced with locally recruited units of the Royal Gibraltar Regiment, while a Royal Navy presence is continued through the Gibraltar Squadron, responsible for overseeing the security of Gibraltar's territorial waters. In March 1988 a British military operation against members of the Provisional IRA (PIRA) planning a car bomb attack in Gibraltar ended in controversy when the Special Air Service shot and killed all three PIRA members.|$|E
5|$|As {{a sophomore}} {{in the fall}} of 1995, he was moved up to the varsity {{basketball}} team from the junior varsity due to injuries. As a junior, his <b>presence</b> <b>was</b> significant enough that one opposing team practiced with a coach holding a broom in the air to simulate playing against him. He helped his team reach the Class 4A-state Region II final. As a junior in baseball, Young threw a no-hitter against McKinney High School in Spring 1997. However, he missed {{a large part of the}} season after getting off to a 6–0 start because of a stress fracture in his foot. Nonetheless, he was already considered a top professional prospect, and he was named as one of seven Highland Park players on the all-district team.

5|$|As {{the use of}} English in worship {{services}} spread, {{the need for a}} complete uniform liturgy for the Church became evident. Initial meetings to start what would eventually become the Book of Common Prayer were held in the former abbey of Chertsey and in Windsor Castle in September 1548. The list of participants can only be partially reconstructed, but it is known that the members were balanced between conservatives and reformers. These meetings were followed by a debate on the Eucharist in the House of Lords which took place between 14 and 19 December. Cranmer publicly revealed in this debate that he had abandoned the doctrine of the corporeal real presence and believed that the Eucharistic <b>presence</b> <b>was</b> only spiritual. Parliament backed the publication of the Prayer Book after Christmas by passing the Act of Uniformity 1549; it then legalized clerical marriage.|$|E
