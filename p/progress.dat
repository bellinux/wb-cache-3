40|$|SummaryInterstitial {{lung disease}} (ILD) {{associated}} with amyopathic dermatomyositis (ADM) {{is a rare}} and sometimes fatal condition whose clinical features are not well understood. The goal {{of this study was}} to clarify the characteristics of ILD based on its development. Eighteen patients diagnosed with ILD associated with ADM were assigned to 1 of 2 groups: (1) a rapidly <b>progressing</b> group, which included patients who developed abnormal lung findings within 1 month of being diagnosed with ADM (n= 9); or (2) a slowly <b>progressing</b> group, which including patients who developed lung findings greater than 1 month after diagnosis of ADM (n= 9). Serum creatine phosphokinase and C-reactive protein levels were higher in the rapidly <b>progressing</b> group than in the slowly <b>progressing</b> group. Further, arterial pH was higher and PaO 2 /FIO 2 was lower in the rapidly <b>progressing</b> group than in the slowly <b>progressing</b> group. On thoracic high-resolution CT, traction bronchiectasis was present in 4 of the 9 rapidly <b>progressing</b> patients but not in any patients of the slowly <b>progressing</b> group. All 9 slowly <b>progressing</b> patients survived with proper treatment, but only 4 of the 9 rapidly <b>progressing</b> patients survived. In ADM, appropriate investigations are likely required for the early diagnosis of ILD. Our data suggest that ILD associated with ADM can be classified into 2 clinical subtypes based on the time course of pulmonary involvement. Patients with rapid progression in respiratory symptoms should undergo intensive treatment as soon as possible to promote favorable outcomes...|$|R
