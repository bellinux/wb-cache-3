30|$|Outsourcing data to <b>external</b> <b>providers</b> {{has gained}} {{momentum}} {{with the advent}} of cloud computing. Encryption allows data confidentiality to be preserved when outsourcing data to untrusted <b>external</b> <b>providers</b> that may be compromised by attackers. However, encryption has to be applied in a way that still allows the <b>external</b> <b>provider</b> to evaluate queries received from the client. Even though confidential database-as-a-service (DaaS) is still an active field of research, various techniques already address this problem, which we call confidentiality preserving indexing approaches (CPIs). CPIs make individual tradeoffs between the functionality provided, i.e., the types of queries that can be evaluated, the level of protection achieved, and performance.|$|R

30|$|With the {{increasing}} number of mobile applications and the popularity of cloud computing, the combination of these two techniques that named mobile cloud computing (MCC) attracts great attention listed by in recent years [1, 2]. MCC is a service that allows mobile users constrained with resources to adaptively adjust processing and storing capabilities by transparently partitioning and offloading the computationally intensive and storage demanding jobs on traditional cloud resources by providing ubiquitous wireless access [2]. In the former mobile computing paradigm, there are some problems such as resource scarcity, frequent disconnections, and mobility. With the support of MCC, the aforementioned problems can be addressed and the mobile users can achieve seamless access and handover for services, since mobile applications are executed on resource <b>providers</b> <b>external</b> to the mobile device.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In Utility Computing {{business}} model, {{the owners}} of the computing resources negotiate with their potential clients to sell computing power. The terms of the Quality of Service (QoS) and the economic conditions are established in a Service-Level Agreement (SLA). There are many scenarios in which the agreed QoS cannot be provided because of errors in the service provisioning or failures in the system. Since providers have usually different types of clients, according to their relationship with the provider or by the fee that they pay, it is important to minimize the impact of the SLA violations in preferential clients. This paper proposes a set of policies to provide better QoS to preferential clients in such situations. The criterion to classify clients is established according to the relationship between client and <b>provider</b> (<b>external</b> user, internal or another privileged relationship) and the QoS that the client purchases (cheap contracts or extra QoS by paying an extra fee). Most of the policies use key features of virtualization: Selectiv...|$|R

40|$|Background: English health-care commissioners {{from the}} NHS need {{information}} to commission effectively. In {{the light of}} new legislation in 2012, new ‘external’ organisations were created such as commissioning support units (CSUs), public health departments moved into local authorities and ‘external’ provider organisations such as commercial and not-for-profit agencies and freelance consultants were encouraged. The aim of this research from 2011 to 2014 was to study knowledge exchange between these <b>external</b> <b>providers</b> and health-care commissioners to learn about knowledge acquisition and transformation, the role of <b>external</b> <b>providers</b> {{and the benefits of}} contracts between <b>external</b> <b>providers</b> and health-care commissioners. Methods: using a case study design, we collected data from eight cases, where commercial and not-for-profit organisations were contracted. We conducted 92 interviews with <b>external</b> <b>providers</b> (n?=? 36), their clients (n?=? 47) and others (n?=? 9), observed 25 training events and meetings and collected various documentation including meeting minutes, reports and websites. Using constant comparison, data were analysed thematically using a coding framework and summaries of cases. Results: in juggling competing agendas, commissioners pragmatically accessed and used information to build a cohesive, persuasive case to plot a course of action, convince others and justify decisions. Local data often trumped national or research-based information. Conversations and stories were fast, flexible and suited to the continually changing commissioning environment. Academic research evidence was occasionally explicitly sought, but usually came predigested via National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guidance, software tools and general practitioner clinical knowledge. Negative research evidence did not trigger discussions of disinvestment opportunities. Every commissioning organisation studied had its own unique blend of three types of commissioning models: clinical commissioning, integrated health and social care and commercial provider. Different types of information were privileged in each model. Commissioners regularly accessed information through five main conduits: (1) interpersonal relationships; (2) people placement (embedded staff); (3) governance (e. g. Department of Health directives); (4) ‘copy, adapt and paste’ (e. g. best practice elsewhere); and (5) product deployment (e. g. software tools). Interpersonal relationships appeared most crucial in influencing commissioning decisions. In transforming knowledge, commissioners undertook repeated, iterative processes of contextualisation using a local lens and engagement to refine the knowledge and ensure that the ‘right people’ were on board. Knowledge became transformed, reshaped and repackaged in the act of acquisition and through these processes as commissioners manoeuvred knowledge through the system. <b>External</b> <b>providers</b> were contracted for their skills and expertise in project management, forecast modelling, event management, pathway development and software tool development. Trust and usability influenced clients’ views on the usefulness of <b>external</b> <b>providers,</b> for example the motivations of Public Health and CSUs were more trusted, but the usefulness of their output was variable. Among the commercial and not-for-profit agencies in this study, one was not very successful, as the NHS clients thought that the <b>external</b> <b>provider</b> added little of extra value. With another, the benefits were largely still notional and with a third views were largely positive, with some concerns about expense. Analysts often benefited more than those making commissioning decisions. Conclusions: <b>external</b> <b>providers</b> who maximised their use of the different conduits and produced something of value beyond what was locally available appeared more successful. The long-standing schism between analysts and commissioners blunted the impact of some contracts on commissioners’ decision-making. To capitalise on the expertise of <b>external</b> <b>providers,</b> wherever possible, contracts should include explicit skills development and knowledge transfer component...|$|R
