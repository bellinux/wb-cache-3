These included North Grange, Meaux Abbey (1957-58), Clarendon Palace, Salisbury, in {{the early}} 1960s, Ramsey Abbey, Cambridgeshire (1967-68) and Haverholme Priory, Lincolnshire, in 1970. At Clarendon she organised the lifting of two <b>pavements</b> <b>and</b> a 13th-century kiln previously uncovered by Tancred Borenius and had them transported to the museum where, a few years later, she created a new gallery for <b>pavements</b> <b>and</b> kilns. In 1978 she was given an MBE. Eames retired from the British Museum in 1980, having completed and published her major work.|$|R

5|$|In a {{case study}} of the Los Angeles Basin, {{simulations}} showed that even when trees are not strategically placed in these urban heat islands, they can still aid in minimization of pollutants and energy reduction. It is estimated that with this wide-scale implementation, the city of Los Angeles can annually save $100M with most of the savings coming from cool roofs, lighter colored <b>pavement,</b> <b>and</b> the planting of trees. With a citywide implementation, added benefits from the lowering smog-level would result in at least one billion dollars of saving per year.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s Dutch elm disease (Ceratocystis ulmi) {{killed off}} all the elms that once {{populated}} the park and crab apples were planted to replace the elms along the pedestrian mall. After deteriorating over the decades Washington Park saw a revival in the 1990s and 2000s with the flower beds being restored to their original specifications, the pedestrian mall removed of <b>pavement</b> <b>and</b> widened to its original dimensions with disease-resistant elms planted to form a canopy, the King Fountain relit at night, and the lilac shrub border around {{the periphery of the}} park being restored.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} coastal Orange County streams, the {{watershed}} of Aliso Creek is now heavily urbanized. With 70percent {{of the original}} land surface now underneath impermeable surfaces such as <b>pavement</b> <b>and</b> buildings, far more runoff now enters the creek—not only inducing an increased year-round flow, but much larger rainy season flows. In the 1920s and 1930s, devastating floods wreaked havoc on much of southern California; the Los Angeles Flood of 1938 was the most famous flooding episode of this period.|$|E

5|$|A {{feature of}} central York is the Snickelways, narrow {{pedestrian}} routes, {{many of which}} led towards the former market-places in <b>Pavement</b> <b>and</b> St Sampson's Square. The Shambles is a narrow medieval street, lined with shops, boutiques and tea rooms. Most of these premises were once butchers' shops, and the hooks from which carcasses were hung and the shelves on which meat was laid out can still be seen outside some of them. The street also contains the Shrine of Margaret Clitherow, {{although it is not}} located in the house where she lived. Goodramgate has many medieval houses including the early 14thcentury Lady Row built to finance a Chantry, {{at the edge of the}} churchyard of Holy Trinity church.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Variscan mountain-building, the Mendip area now {{comprises}} at least four anticlinal fold structures, with an east-west trend, each with a core of older Devonian sandstone and Silurian volcanic rocks. The latter are quarried for use in road construction and as a concrete aggregate. The Mendips were considerably higher and steeper 200 to 300million years ago, and subsequent erosion has resulted in a range of surface features including gorges, dry valleys, screes, swallets and others typical of karst landscapes. These are complemented underground by a large number of caves both beneath the plateau and {{at the base of the}} southern escarpment. Wookey Hole is one example of the caves of the area. There are also areas of limestone <b>pavement</b> <b>and</b> other karst features. Dissolution of the limestone produced many of the gorges including Cheddar Gorge and Burrington Combe. Springs are a common feature of the eastern part of the hills, a number of which have associated tufa deposits.|$|E
5|$|Further {{construction}} of the motorway was suspended by {{the onset of the}} Croatian War of Independence. In October 1991, a part of the motorway between Novska and Nova Gradiška became inaccessible to the government of the Republic of Croatia due to military occupation of the area by the forces of the so-called SAO Western Slavonia. Consequently, the NovskaNova Gradiška section was closed to all traffic. On December 21, 1994, negotiations led to the reopening of that section for transit traffic. However, the section remained unsafe for use as intermittent violence continued until May 1995, when the area was overrun by the Croatian army. Inspection of the motorway section carried out at the time revealed damage to a viaduct carrying the motorway over the ZagrebSisakVinkovci railroad and a local road near Novska. Besides the overall lack of maintenance during the period, the <b>pavement</b> <b>and</b> a number of flyovers were damaged by artillery bombardments, and the flyover approach embankments were damaged where trenches were dug.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) calls John Doggett (Robert Patrick) {{to inform}} {{him about the}} case and says {{she will not be}} joining him, due to personal matters. Doggett visits the crime scene, where he meets up with his boss, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi). Skinner tells him about the cult and how the victims died. Leeds' body is found in his car, but his partner, Stedman, is missing, along with cult leader Anthony Tipet (Keith Szarabajka): the man with the third eye. The FBI later finds Stedman at his locked-up condo with a fatal blow to the head. Meanwhile, Tipet is searching for a pharmacist and stumbles into a phone booth to call an unnamed person. When a tramp asks him for change, Tipet attacks the tramp, trapping him in the <b>pavement</b> <b>and</b> axing his forehead.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} causes {{of an urban}} heat island (UHI); for example, dark {{surfaces}} absorb significantly more solar radiation, which causes urban concentrations of roads and buildings to heat more than suburban and rural areas during the day; materials commonly used in urban areas for <b>pavement</b> <b>and</b> roofs, such as concrete and asphalt, have significantly different thermal bulk properties (including heat capacity and thermal conductivity) and surface radiative properties (albedo and emissivity) than the surrounding rural areas. This causes {{a change in the}} energy budget of the urban area, often leading to higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas. Another major reason is the lack of evapotranspiration (for example, through lack of vegetation) in urban areas. With a decreased amount of vegetation, cities also lose the shade and cooling effect of trees, and the removal of carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|A snow sweeper uses brushes {{to remove}} thin layers of snow from the {{pavement}} surface. Snow sweepers are used after plowing {{to remove any}} remaining material missed by the larger vehicles in areas with very low snow-tolerance, such as airport runways and racing tracks, as the flexible brushes follow the terrain better than the rigid blades of snowplows and snow blowers. These brushes also allow the vehicle to be used on the tactile tiles found at traffic lights and tram stops, without damaging the delicate surface. Unlike other winter service vehicles, snow sweepers do not compress the snow, leaving a rough, high friction, surface behind them. This makes snow sweepers the most efficient method of snow removal for snow depths below 10centimetres (4in). Snow deeper than this however can clog the brushes, and most snow sweepers cannot be used to clear snow deeper than 15centimetres (6in). A more advanced version of the snow sweeper is the jet sweeper, which adds an air-blower just behind the brushes, in order to blow the swept snow clear of the <b>pavement</b> <b>and</b> prevent the loosened snow from settling.|$|E

5|$|After the war, of course, {{the roads}} were all bad. There were cobbles from the moment you left Paris, or Senlis where we started in those days. There'd be {{stretches}} of surfaced roads and often there'd be a cycle path or a <b>pavement</b> <b>and</b> sometimes a thin stretch of something smoother. But you never knew where was best to ride and you were for ever switching about. You could jump your bike up on to a pavement but that got harder the more tired you got. Then you'd get your front wheel up but not your back wheel. That happened to me. And then you'd go sprawling, of course, and you could bring other riders down. Or they'd fall off and bring you down with them. And the cycle paths were often just compressed cinders, which got soft {{in the rain and}} got churned up by so many riders using them and then you got stuck and you lost your balance. And come what may, you got covered in coal dust and other muck. No, it's all changed and you can't compare then and now.|$|E
