40|$|Proposed {{cutbacks in}} {{government}} science funding have caused many {{to expect that}} the rate of scientific progress will significantly decline. Before the magnitude of the decline can be estimated, a preliminary question must be answered: what {{is the extent to which}} <b>private</b> <b>funding</b> of science may be expected to fill the gap left by the declining government funding? Using data on government and <b>private</b> <b>funding</b> of science, preliminary estimation indicates that past government funding of science has not "crowded out" <b>private</b> <b>funding</b> of science. If this finding is supported by further research, it would indicate that <b>private</b> <b>funding</b> could not be expected to replace lost federal funding of science.
