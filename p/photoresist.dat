25|$|Photoengraving uses a {{photomask}} and developer to selectively {{remove a}} UV-sensitive <b>photoresist</b> coating and thus create a <b>photoresist</b> mask. Direct imaging techniques are sometimes used for high-resolution requirements. Experiments {{were made with}} thermal resist.|$|E
25|$|The {{invention}} of chemically-amplified <b>photoresist</b> by Hiroshi Ito, C. Grant Willson and J.M.J. Fréchet at IBM c. 1980 that was 5-10 times {{more sensitive to}} ultraviolet light. IBM introduced chemically amplified <b>photoresist</b> for DRAM production in the mid-1980s.|$|E
25|$|In the process, an X-ray {{sensitive}} polymer <b>photoresist,</b> typically PMMA, {{bonded to}} an electrically conductive substrate, {{is exposed to}} parallel beams of high-energy X-rays from a synchrotron radiation source through a mask partly covered with a strong X-ray absorbing material. Chemical removal of exposed (or unexposed) <b>photoresist</b> results in a three-dimensional structure, which can be filled by the electrodeposition of metal. The resist is chemically stripped away to produce a metallic mold insert. The mold insert {{can be used to}} produce parts in polymers or ceramics through injection molding.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{the high}} {{efficiency}} of absorption of EUV by <b>photoresists,</b> heating and outgassing become primary concerns. Organic <b>photoresists</b> outgas hydrocarbons while metal oxide <b>photoresists</b> outgas water and oxygen and metal (in a hydrogen ambient); the last is uncleanable. [...] The carbon contamination is known to affect multilayer reflectivity while the oxygen is particularly harmful for the ruthenium capping layers on the EUV multilayer optics.|$|R
30|$|However, <b>photoresists</b> have weaker {{cross-linking}} at an edge {{than at the}} center. At edges, cross-linked <b>photoresists</b> can {{be easily}} damaged during the RIE process if the etching time is long enough. In that case, the cross-linked <b>photoresists</b> at the edge areas can be crushed by the reactive ions after {{the formation of the}} Ti protruded cylinders. This allows the protruded cylinders to be converted into conical islands by increasing the dry etching time, as shown in Figure  2 a.|$|R

25|$|The {{degree of}} {{photoelectron}} emission from the layer underlying the EUV <b>photoresist</b> {{has been shown}} to affect the depth of focus. Unfortunately, hardmask layers tend to increase photoelectron emission, degrading the depth of focus.|$|E
25|$|Sodium acetate {{is used in}} {{the textile}} {{industry}} to neutralize sulfuric acid waste streams and also as a <b>photoresist</b> while using aniline dyes. It is also a pickling agent in chrome tanning and helps to impede vulcanization of chloroprene in synthetic rubber production. In processing cotton for disposable cotton pads, sodium acetate is used to eliminate the buildup of static electricity.|$|E
25|$|Initially PCBs were {{designed}} manually {{by creating a}} photomask on a clear mylar sheet, usually at two or four times the true size. Starting from the schematic diagram the component pin pads were {{laid out on the}} mylar and then traces were routed to connect the pads. Rub-on dry transfers of common component footprints increased efficiency. Traces were made with self-adhesive tape. Pre-printed non-reproducing grids on the mylar assisted in layout. To fabricate the board, the finished photomask was photolithographically reproduced onto a <b>photoresist</b> coating on the blank copper-clad boards.|$|E
50|$|Negative <b>photoresists</b> are {{composed}} of a poly(cis-isoprene) matrix, xylene solvent, and bis-arylazide as the photoactive compound. Negative <b>photoresists</b> react to light by polymerizing. The unexposed portions can be removed by using a developer solution. negative resist has better adhesion and is great for features greater than 2 µm in size.|$|R

40|$|Stripping {{high-dose}} ion-implanted (HDI) <b>photoresists</b> {{is considered}} {{as one of the}} most challengeable processes in the semiconductor manufacturing due to the difficulty of both removing crust (or carbonized layer) formed during the ion implantation and preventing the silicon recess after subsequent cleaning. The HDI <b>photoresists</b> are conventionally removed by using a two-step process...|$|R
25|$|Photolithography {{involves}} {{exposing a}} light source to a photoresist-coated silicon wafer; a mask with the desired pattern is {{place between the}} light source and the wafer, thereby selectively allowing light to filter through and create the pattern on the <b>photoresist.</b> Further development of the wafer brings out the pattern in the <b>photoresist.</b> Photolithography performed in the near-UV is often viewed as the standard for fabricating topographies on the micro-scale. However, because the lower limit for size {{is a function of}} the wavelength, this method cannot be used to create nanoscale features. In their 2005 study, Mahoney et al. created organized arrays of polyimide channels (11µm in height and 20–60µm in width) were created on a glass substrate by photolithography. Polyimide was used because it adheres to glass well, is chemically stable in aqueous solution, and is biocompatible. It is hypothesized that the microchannels limited the range of angles that cytoskeletal elements within the neurite growth cones could accumulate, assemble, and orient. There was a significant decrease in the number of neurites emerging from the soma; however, there was less decrease as the range of angles over which the neurites emerged was increased. Also, the neurites were on average two times longer when the neurons were cultured on the microchannels versus the controls on a flat surface; this could be due to a more efficient alignment of filaments.|$|E
25|$|Bitumen {{was used}} in early {{photographic}} technology. In 1826 or 1827, it was used by French scientist Joseph Nicéphore Niépce to make the oldest surviving photograph from nature. The bitumen was thinly coated onto a pewter plate which was then exposed in a camera. Exposure to light hardened the bitumen and made it insoluble, so that when it was subsequently rinsed with a solvent only the sufficiently light-struck areas remained. Many hours of exposure in the camera were required, making bitumen impractical for ordinary photography, but from the 1850s to the 1920s it was in common use as a <b>photoresist</b> {{in the production of}} printing plates for various photomechanical printing processes.|$|E
25|$|In {{semiconductor}} {{research and}} industry, PMMA aids as a resist in the {{electron beam lithography}} process. A solution consisting of the polymer in a solvent is used to spin coat silicon and other semiconducting and semi-insulating wafers with a thin film. Patterns on this {{can be made by}} an electron beam (using an electron microscope), deep UV light (shorter wavelength than the standard photolithography process), or X-rays. Exposure to these creates chain scission or (de-cross-linking) within the PMMA, allowing for the selective removal of exposed areas by a chemical developer, making it a positive <b>photoresist.</b> PMMA's advantage is that it allows for extremely high resolution patterns to be made. Smooth PMMA surface can be easily nanostructured by treatment in oxygen radio-frequency plasma and nanostructured PMMA surface can be easily smoothed by vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) irradiation.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{report the}} effects on {{pluripotent}} stem cells proliferation of an antimony salt in chemically amplified negative <b>photoresists</b> (e. g., SU- 8, TMMR) commonly used in MEMS fabrications. Since antimony and its derivatives are suspected to be toxic for mammalian cells including mESCs (mouse embryonic stem cells) and hiPSCs (human induced pluripotent stem cells), {{but it has not}} yet been investigated. Irrespective of antimony in <b>photoresists,</b> mESCs and hiPSCs cultured on <b>photoresists</b> coated with Matrigel were able to form their colonies and maintain at an undifferentiated state for 7 -day culture. The successful 7 -day culture is suggested to be ability for investigations of stem cells culture in microfluidic systems...|$|R
5000|$|Throughout his career, Trefonas {{has focused}} on {{materials}} science and the chemistry of photolithography. By understanding the chemistry of <b>photoresists</b> used in lithography, {{he has been able}} to develop anti-reflective coatings and polymer <b>photoresists</b> that support finely-tuned etching used in the production of integrated circuits. These materials and techniques make it possible to fit more circuits into a given area. [...] Over time, lithographic technologies have developed to allow lithography to use smaller wavelengths of light. Trefonas has helped to overcome a number of apparent limits to the sizes that are achievable, developing <b>photoresists</b> that are responsive to 436-nm and 365-nm ultraviolet light, and as small as 193 nm deep.|$|R
2500|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} {{is used for}} very fine resolution photolithography, a procedure wherein a chemical called a <b>photoresist</b> is exposed to UV radiation that has passed through a mask. The exposure causes chemical reactions {{to occur in the}} <b>photoresist.</b> After removal of unwanted <b>photoresist,</b> a pattern determined by the mask remains on the sample. Steps may then be taken to [...] "etch" [...] away, deposit on or otherwise modify areas of the sample where no <b>photoresist</b> remains.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fabrication}} of high-aspect-ratio structures requires {{the use of}} a <b>photoresist</b> able to form a mold with vertical sidewalls. Thus the <b>photoresist</b> must have a high selectivity and be relatively free from stress when applied in thick layers. [...] The typical choice, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is applied to the substrate by a glue-down process in which a precast, high-molecular-weight sheet of PMMA is attached to the plating base on the substrate. The applied <b>photoresist</b> is then milled down to the precise height by a fly cutter prior to pattern transfer by X-ray exposure. Because the layer must be relatively free from stress, this glue-down process is preferred over alternative methods such as casting. [...] Further, the cutting of the PMMA sheet by the fly cutter requires specific operating conditions and tools to avoid introducing any stress and crazing of the <b>photoresist.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Some non-chemical uses include {{removal of}} hair from animal hides and {{photography}} developing solutions. In the semiconductor industry, hydroxylamine {{is often a}} component in the [...] "resist stripper", which removes <b>photoresist</b> after lithography.|$|E

30|$|The {{developed}} {{methods have}} several advantages {{in comparison with}} the existing methods of interference lithography on chalcogenide <b>photoresists.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Unlike optical lithography, {{there are}} {{multiple}} exposure limits, identified as the top dose, bottom dose, and critical dose, whose values must be determined experimentally for a proper exposure. [...] The exposure must be sufficient {{to meet the requirements}} of the bottom dose, the exposure under which a <b>photoresist</b> residue will remain, and the top dose, the exposure over which the <b>photoresist</b> will foam. [...] The critical dose is the exposure at which unexposed resist begins to be attacked. [...] Due to the insensitivity of PMMA, a typical exposure time for a [...] thick PMMA is six hours. [...] During exposure, secondary radiation effects such as Fresnel diffraction, mask and substrate fluorescence, and the generation of Auger electrons and photoelectrons can lead to overexposure.|$|E
2500|$|Antireflective {{coatings}} {{are often}} used in microelectronic photolithography to help reduce image distortions associated with reflections off {{the surface of the}} substrate. [...] Different types of antireflective coatings are applied either before or after the <b>photoresist,</b> and help reduce standing waves, thin-film interference, and specular reflections.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{its high}} {{refractive}} index of 2.45 and its large Knoop hardness compared to organic photoresists, As2S3 {{has been investigated}} for the fabrication of photonic crystals with a full-photonic band-gap. [...] Advances in laser patterning techniques such as three-dimensional direct laser writing (3-D DLW) and chemical wet-etching chemistry, has allowed this material {{to be used as}} a <b>photoresist</b> to fabricate 3-D nanostructures.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} better cover the surface of substrate, <b>photoresists</b> are {{required}} to possess relatively low surface tension.|$|R
40|$|A {{lithography}} machine {{designed for}} laser direct writing of metawsation in ASIC's and MCM, {{and the associated}} practical process are described. To demonstrate the feasibility of the laser direct writing, the last level of metallisation on a bipolar ASIC has been drawn.

It {{is widely used}} to strip <b>photoresist</b> in TFT-LCD 'flat panel' displays and advanced packaging applications (such as wafer-level packaging / solder bump patterning). [...] It also used in biopreservation especially stem cell banking. DMSO is an effective paint stripper, being safer {{than many of the}} others such as nitromethane and dichloromethane.|$|E
2500|$|In manufacturing, an {{undercut}} {{is a special}} type of recessed surface. In turning, it refers to a recess in a diameter. In machining, it refers to a recess in a corner. In molding, it refers to a feature that cannot be molded using only a single pull mold. In printed circuit board, construction {{it refers to the}} portion of the copper that is etched away under the <b>photoresist.</b> In welding, it refers to undesired melting and removal of metal near the weld bead.|$|E
2500|$|UV LIGA {{utilizes}} {{an inexpensive}} ultraviolet light source, like a mercury lamp, to expose a polymer <b>photoresist,</b> typically SU-8. [...] Because heating and transmittance {{are not an}} issue in optical masks, a simple chromium mask can be substituted for the technically sophisticated X-ray mask. [...] These reductions in complexity make UV LIGA much cheaper and more accessible than its X-ray counterpart. [...] However, UV LIGA is not as effective at producing precision molds and is thus used when cost must be kept low and very high aspect ratios are not required.|$|E
