500|$|The DB9 {{has been}} adapted {{for use in}} sports car racing by Aston Martin Racing, a {{collaboration}} between Aston Martin and Prodrive. Called the DBR9, the car debuted in 2005. It retains the DB9's 5.9 L V12 engine basic parts, but the car has been extensively modified to decrease its weight {{as well as to}} improve performance. Most of the car's aluminium body panels have been replaced with carbon fibre panels, and several external features, like a front splitter and a rear wing, have been added to increase the car's downforce. Inside, the DB9's interior has mostly been scrapped to save weight. Likewise, though the suspension's layout remains the same, it has been improved to racing specifications. The brakes are upgraded to Brembo carbon-carbon disks and six-piston calipers. The transmission in the DBR9 is a Xtrac six-speed sequential manual, containing a Salisbury friction-plate limited-slip differential, and the <b>prop</b> <b>shaft</b> is also made of carbon fibre. The engine modifications allow the car to develop [...] and [...] of torque; that power, in addition to the lost weight, allows the DBR9 can go from 0 to [...] in 6.4 seconds.|$|E
2500|$|In {{rear-wheel drive}} {{automobiles}} the central drive shaft (or <b>prop</b> <b>shaft)</b> engages the differential through a hypoid gear(ring and pinion). The ring gear {{is mounted on}} the carrier of the planetary chain that forms the differential. [...] This hypoid gear is a bevel gear that changes {{the direction of the}} drive rotation.|$|E
2500|$|New {{low-drag}} {{disc brakes}} were featured as standard equipment. A five-speed manual transmission joined the options list. The optional automatic transmission received wider gear ratios for better fuel economy. All received as standard equipment the [...] "Select Drive" [...] {{system that could}} be changed between all-wheel drive and two-wheel drive for a potential increase in fuel economy. The system put the front axle and <b>prop</b> <b>shaft</b> into the gas-saving freewheeling mode from the driver's seat. The Series 30 sedan was no longer available with the Sport package.|$|E
50|$|Complementary to {{the nuclear}} {{component}} there are two conventional boilers, installed as a backup in case of reactor failure. Both components are capable of driving two geared steam turbines, generating 120,000 hp (89 MW) at two <b>prop</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{constant}} velocity joint used to make modern articulated drive shafts was unheard of as yet and even the simpler Hooke-type universal joint wasn't yet in common use. Thornycroft's usual practice for <b>prop</b> <b>shafts</b> {{at the time was}} to use a flexible leather disk joint. To save weight, the axle casings were cast in aluminium.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the service}} began on 30 June 2011, {{preparation}} of the Argyll Flyer had been held up by broken rear <b>prop</b> <b>shafts.</b> As an interim measure the cruise boat [...] was leased from Clyde Cruises to start the service. She suffered breakdowns during the first day, then continued in interim service alongside the other two ferries for a short period.|$|R
2500|$|When {{used in this}} way, a {{differential}} couples {{the longitudinal}} input shaft (or <b>prop</b> <b>shaft)</b> to the pinion, which in turn drives the transverse ring gear of the differential. This also works as reduction gearing. On rear wheel drive vehicles the differential may connect to half-shafts inside an axle housing, or drive shafts that connect to the rear driving wheels. Front wheel drive vehicles tend to have the engine crankshaft and the gearbox shafts transverse, and with the pinion {{on the end of}} the main-shaft of the gearbox and the differential enclosed in the same housing as the gearbox. There are individual drive-shafts to each wheel. A differential consists of one input, the drive shaft, and two outputs which are the two drive wheels, however the rotation of the drive wheels are coupled to each other by their connection to the roadway. [...] Under normal conditions, with small tire slip, the ratio of the speeds of the two driving wheels is defined by the ratio of the radii of the paths around which the two wheels are rolling, which in turn is determined by the track-width of the vehicle (the distance between the driving wheels) and the radius of the turn.|$|E

5000|$|In April 2015, [...] had {{problems}} with her <b>prop</b> <b>shaft</b> which delayed the introduction of her additional Arran summer sailings, leaving Caledonian Isles to carry all the traffic and run additional sailings at night.|$|E
50|$|Only half {{tracks were}} able to operate in these conditions, but {{removing}} them from their combat role for supply duties was not feasible, so {{it was decided to}} produce half-tracked versions of standard Opel, Daimler-Benz, Alfa-Romeo and Ford trucks (lorries) by removing their rear axles, truncating the <b>prop</b> <b>shafts</b> and connecting them to redundant Panzer I track assemblies. Heavier trucks (4 tons payload) were fitted with Panzer II track assemblies.|$|R
5000|$|It {{had more}} than sixteen {{patented}} features, including the IRD or Intermediate Reduction Drive, which acted as a front differential and fixed ratio transfer; the VCU or viscous-coupling, which reacts to the differing rotational speed of the <b>prop</b> <b>shafts,</b> allowing varying torque across itself; and the Hill Descent Control system, which was then implemented {{in the rest of}} the Land Rover range and even in the first generation BMW X5. (BMW was the parent company of Rover Group at the time of the introduction of this model).|$|R
60|$|A {{few days}} after {{reaching}} this decision, he discovered the tracks of two lions {{in the neighborhood of}} Mt. Everett. The hounds were put on the trail and followed it into an abandoned coal shaft. Jones recognized this as his opportunity, and taking his lasso and an extra rope, he crawled into the hole. Not fifteen feet from the opening sat one of the cougars, snarling and spitting. Jones promptly lassoed it, passed his end of the lasso round a side <b>prop</b> of the <b>shaft,</b> and out to the soldiers who had followed him. Instructing them not to pull till he called, he cautiously began to crawl by the cougar, with the intention of getting farther back and roping its hind leg, so as to prevent disaster when the soldiers pulled it out. He accomplished this, not without some uneasiness in regard to the second lion, and giving the word to his companions, soon had his captive hauled from the shaft and tied so tightly it could not move.|$|R
50|$|In British English, {{the term}} {{transmission}} {{refers to the}} whole drivetrain, including clutch, gearbox, <b>prop</b> <b>shaft</b> (for rear-wheel drive), differential, and final drive shafts. In American English, however, the term refers more specifically to the gearbox alone, and detailed usage differs.|$|E
50|$|The CA {{utilised}} {{a contemporary}} powertrain layout. This {{consisted of a}} front-mounted longitudinally-oriented internal combustion engine, and rear-wheel drive. The 3-speed gearbox was mounted immediately behind the engine, and torque was transmitted to a live rear axle via an open tubular <b>prop</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E
50|$|Large Fast {{electric}} boats over 2 feet {{in length}} tend to use surface piercing props.The <b>prop</b> <b>shaft</b> is almost horizontal {{with only a few}} degrees of down angle. This reduces wet drag of the shaft and ensures that most of the thrust goes to push the boat forward.|$|E
60|$|It {{was not the}} entreaty made by {{her aunt}} that an early day should be fixed for the {{marriage}} which made Mary Lowther determine that she would yet once more attempt to drag the wagon. She could have withstood such entreaty as that, and, had the letter gone no further, would probably have replied to it by saying that no day could be fixed at all. But, with the letter there came an assurance that Walter Marrable had forgotten her, was about to marry Edith Brownlow, and that therefore all ideas of love and truth and sympathy and joint beating of mutual hearts, {{with the rest of}} it, might be thrown to the winds. She would marry Harry Gilmore, and take care that he had good dinners, and would give her mind to flannel petticoats and coal for the poor of Bullhampton, and would altogether come down from the pedestal which she had once striven to erect for herself. From that high but tottering pedestal, <b>propped</b> up on <b>shafts</b> of romance and poetry, she would come down; but there would remain for her the lower, firmer standing block, of which duty was the sole support. It was no doubt most unreasonable that any such change should come upon her in consequence of her aunt's letter. She had never for a moment told herself that Walter Marrable could ever be anything to her, since that day on which she had by her own deed liberated him from his troth; and, indeed, had done more than that, had forced him to accept that liberation. Why then should his engagement with another woman have any effect with her either in one direction or in the other? She herself had submitted to a new engagement,--had done so before he had shown any sign of being fickle. She could not therefore be angry with him. And yet, because he could be fickle, because he could do that very thing which she had openly declared her purpose of doing, she persuaded herself,--for a week or two,--that any sacrifice made to him would be a sacrifice to folly, and a neglect of duty.|$|R
50|$|A drive shaft, driveshaft, driving shaft, {{propeller}} shaft (<b>prop</b> <b>shaft),</b> or Cardan shaft is a mechanical component for transmitting torque and rotation, usually used to connect other {{components of a}} drive train that cannot be connected directly because of distance or the need to allow for relative movement between them.|$|E
50|$|In {{rear-wheel drive}} {{automobiles}} the central drive shaft (or <b>prop</b> <b>shaft)</b> engages the differential through a hypoid gear(ring and pinion). The ring gear {{is mounted on}} the carrier of the planetary chain that forms the differential. This hypoid gear is a bevel gear that changes {{the direction of the}} drive rotation.|$|E
50|$|Scania-Vabis’ new truck, {{unlike the}} older models, sported modern {{facilities}} like an overhead valve engine, four-speed gear box bolted {{directly to the}} clutch and the engine, <b>prop</b> <b>shaft</b> drive, pneumatic tires and a covered cab. The truck could reach the dizzying top speed of 40 kph mph, a doubling compared to its predecessors.|$|E
5000|$|The car was {{powered by}} a four-cylinder 1221 cc ohv {{water-cooled}} engine producing at maximum power [...] at 4,200 rpm. The four-speed gear-box included synchromesh on the top three ratios, power being delivered to the rear wheels via a jointed <b>prop</b> <b>shaft.</b> Top speeds of between 90 km/h (56 mph) and 105 km/h (65 mph) were quoted.|$|E
50|$|The Westfall Sport uses a {{welded steel}} tube {{fuselage}} with fabric covering. It was originally {{equipped with a}} model A Ford engine. The prototype used a radiator with a hole cut out for the <b>prop</b> <b>shaft,</b> but later changed to a modified OX-5 radiator below the cowling. A second prototype was built with a 65 hp. LeBlond engine in 1935.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{water is}} 600 times more dense than air, {{it is not}} {{practical}} to attach a long thin aircraft type propeller to a boat's <b>prop</b> <b>shaft</b> due to material strength and other factors (e.g. [...] "prop walk"). Larger props, however, are more efficient overall, and having the top blades of a surface piercing prop spinning in the air reduces load.|$|E
5000|$|The car was {{powered by}} a four-cylinder 1213 cc ohv {{water-cooled}} engine producing at maximum power [...] at 4,200 rpm. The four-speed gear-box included synchromesh on the top three ratios, power being delivered to the rear wheels via a jointed <b>prop</b> <b>shaft.</b> Front suspension: Independent using transverse leaf springs. Rear suspension: independent using transverse leaf springs with floating half-axles. Top speed: 105 km/h.|$|E
50|$|The car uses a donor pack from a BMW 3 Series. The donor pack {{includes}} differential, half-shafts, brakes, <b>prop</b> <b>shaft,</b> {{steering column}} and lower steering shaft and if required, engine and gearbox. The large engine bay helps accommodate most engines, including 2.0-litre Cosworth, BMW straight six and Rover V8. The chassis comes with BMW engine mounts already welded to the chassis to ease fitment.|$|E
50|$|The car was {{powered by}} a four-cylinder 1089 cc OHV {{water-cooled}} engine producing at maximum power 32 hp at 4,200 rpm. The four-speed gear-box included synchromesh on the top two ratios, power being delivered to the rear wheels via a jointed <b>prop</b> <b>shaft.</b> Front suspension: Independent using transverse leaf springs. Rear suspension: independent using transverse leaf springs with floating half-axles. Top speed:100 km/h; (62 mph).|$|E
50|$|The {{transmission}} was {{a permanent}} {{four wheel drive}} system, with a high and low range transfer box, locking centre differential at the transfer box. Similarly {{to the rest of}} the Land Rover range, the handbrake acts on the transmission at the back of the transfer box, therefore locking the rear <b>prop</b> <b>shaft</b> or both front and rear prop shafts if the central differential lock is engaged.|$|E
5000|$|The car was {{powered by}} a 1221 cc four-cylinder ohv {{water-cooled}} engine delivering [...] of output, inherited from its predecessor, and which later also {{found its way into}} the company’s Octavia model. The four-speed gear-box included synchromesh on the top three ratios, power being delivered to the rear wheels via a jointed <b>prop</b> <b>shaft.</b> A top speed of 100 km/h (63 mph) was quoted.|$|E
50|$|They also {{entered the}} 24 Hours of Le Mans {{with the help}} from Vitaphone Racing Team. The Vitaphone team where not allowed to race their Maserati MC12 as it didn't pass the ACO's {{technical}} regulations so they raced the DBR9 along with Strakka during Le Mans. Leventis and Hardman shared the car with Alexandre Negrão. The car retired with <b>prop</b> <b>shaft</b> failure after 82 laps around the Circuit de la Sarthe.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to keep costs down}} Riley entered into an {{agreement}} with Briggs bodies to produce a steel (non coach-built) body for a newly designed chassis. This new chassis was introduced in 1936 and incorporated such features as Girling rod operated brakes and a <b>prop</b> <b>shaft</b> final drive for the Nine (though the 12 hp variant retained the torque tube). The Briggs body was named the Merlin and was available alongside the last nine Kestrel variant, also built on the [...] "Merlin" [...] chassis.|$|E
5000|$|New {{low-drag}} {{disc brakes}} were featured as standard equipment. A five-speed manual transmission joined the options list. The optional automatic transmission received wider gear ratios for better fuel economy.

The system put the front axle and <b>prop</b> <b>shaft</b> into the gas-saving freewheeling mode from the driver's seat. The Series 30 sedan was no longer available with the Sport package.|$|E
50|$|A {{stuffing}} box of a sailboat {{will have a}} stern tube that's slightly bigger than the <b>prop</b> <b>shaft.</b> It will also have packing nut threads or a gland nut. The packing is inside the gland nut and creates the seal. The shaft is wrapped by the packing {{and put in the}} gland nut. Through tightening it onto the stern tube, the packing is compressed, creating a seal against the shaft. Creating a proper plunger alignment is critical for correct flow and a long wear life. Stuffing box components are of stainless steel, brass or other application-specific materials.|$|E
50|$|When {{used in this}} way, a {{differential}} couples {{the input}} shaft (or <b>prop</b> <b>shaft)</b> to the pinion, which in turn runs on the ring gear of the differential. This also works as reduction gearing. On rear wheel drive vehicles the differential may connect to half-shafts inside an axle housing, or drive shafts that connect to the rear driving wheels. Front wheel drive vehicles tend to have the pinion {{on the end of}} the main-shaft of the gearbox and the differential is enclosed in the same housing as the gearbox. There are individual drive-shafts to each wheel.|$|E
5000|$|All {{these cars}} are based around the TC3's solid transmission, which uses two bevel-geared {{differentials}} (or [...] "diffs"), with a <b>prop</b> <b>shaft</b> connecting them. On the BJ4, JConcepts used AE diff cases and diffs, and modified the shaft {{to include a}} slipper unit. Since then, JConcepts has updated the BJ4 to the Worlds-winning 'Worlds' edition. In Summer 2006, JConcepts [...] "turned the drawings over to Team Associated, which took over and fine-tuned the design for fit and finish" [...] (RC Driver magazine, Dec. 2007). The Associated B44 debuted at the 2007 EP Off-Road World Championships, where it not only qualified on top, but took all three podium positions.|$|E
5000|$|Transmission {{is through}} a single -inch clutch plate along with a 4-speed-and-reverse gear box. The hand brake {{operated}} a transmission brake attached to the rear end of the gear box. A conventional Hardy Spicer <b>prop</b> <b>shaft</b> connected it to the axle. The rear axle is a worm and wheel with underslung worm, making for a low floor. Ratios 5.25, 5.75, 6.25/1. The brakes are Lockheed hydraulic acting on -inch drums with one leading and one trailing shoe on all 4 wheels. The petrol tank is at the rear, unlike Super 7’s which had a gravity tank. Fuel was pumped either by Autovac or SU Petrolift.|$|E
50|$|This type {{of joint}} {{has also been}} used on drive shafts. Farm {{tractors}} and lawn and garden equipment have often used them in this application, and even some higher-power applications, such as some 1960s race cars, featured them. In automobile and truck <b>prop</b> <b>shaft</b> designs, they have now mostly been replaced by constant-velocity joints or driveshafts with pairs of universal joints. Rear-wheel drive cars have commonly used a lengthwise propeller shaft with a rubber doughnut joint at the gearbox end (limited movement) and a universal joint at the rear axle (greater movement), or vice versa. This gives articulation where needed, but also stops some of the vibration being transmitted into the body.|$|E
5000|$|Gondola's {{evolution}} continues. Early {{in service}} {{the engine was}} significantly modified by Roger Mallinson of Windermere, a local steam boat engine manufacturer, as it was very noisy and broke down too often. He effectively re-built it to achieve the sweetly running unit that now allows her to run reliably and on time. Today she {{is powered by a}} twin cylinder 90 degree [...] "V" [...] steam engine, with a slip eccentric reverse system and a double-acting slide valve arrangement. It develops a maximum torque of about 8,000 N·m (5,900 lb·ft) at the <b>prop</b> <b>shaft,</b> turning the 36" [...] diameter propeller at some 150-160 rpm to give a hull cruising speed of about 8 knots (9 mph or 15 km/h).|$|E
