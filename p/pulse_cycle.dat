These irrigation devices pump salt water solution through a tube, {{in connection with}} a nasal adapter tip designed to seal against the nostril. Some of these machines allow adjustment of water volume/speed by use of an adjustment dial which regulates pump speed and volume per minute. Most of these motorized machines use a pulsatile or pulsating water pumping action at a relatively low, predetermined fixed pulse cyclic rate, designed to match the normal wave rate of healthy, unobstructed nasal cilia.

The algorithm {{is motivated by}} the results of a recent study on the perceived pitch of alternate <b>pulse</b> <b>cycles</b> in speech [1]. The algorithm employs a logarithmic frequency scale and a spectrum shifting technique to obtain the amplitude summation of harmonics and subharmonics, respectively. Through comparing the amplitude ratio of subharmonics and harmonics with the pitch perception results, the pitch of normal speech as well as speech with alternate <b>pulse</b> <b>cycles</b> (APC) can be determined..

40|$|Hand–arm {{vibration}} syndrome is a vascular disease of occupational origin and {{a form of}} secondary Raynaud's phenomenon. Chronic exposure to hand-held vibrating tools may cause endothelial injury. This study investigates the biomechanical forces involved in the transduction of fluid vibration in the endothelium. Human endothelial cells were exposed to direct vibration and rapid low-volume fluid oscillation. Rapid low-volume fluid oscillation was used to simulate the effects of vibration by generating defined temporal gradients in fluid shear stress across an endothelial monolayer. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK 1 / 2) phosphorylation and endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) release were monitored as specific biochemical markers for temporal gradients and endothelial response, respectively. Both vibrational methods were found to phosphorylate ERK 1 / 2 in a similar pattern. At a fixed frequency of fluid oscillation where the duration of each <b>pulse</b> <b>cycle</b> remained constant, ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation increased with the increasing magnitude of the applied temporal gradient. However, when the frequency of flow oscillation was increased (thus decreasing the duration of each <b>pulse</b> <b>cycle),</b> ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation was attenuated across all temporal gradient flow profiles. Fluid oscillation significantly stimulated ET- 1 release compared to steady flow, and endothelin- 1 was also attenuated {{with the increase in}} oscillation frequency. Taken together, these results show that both the absolute magnitude of the temporal gradient and the frequency/duration of each <b>pulse</b> <b>cycle</b> {{play a role in the}} biomechanical transduction of fluid vibrational forces in endothelial cells. Furthermore, this study reports for the first time a link between the ERK 1 / 2 signal transduction pathway and transmission of vibrational forces in the endothelium...|$|E
