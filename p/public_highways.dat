5|$|Highway16 {{was one of}} {{the first}} roads taken over by the {{expanding}} Department of <b>Public</b> <b>Highways</b> in 1918. The important corridor between the Trans-provincial Highway (Highway2) and Ottawa was known as the Prescott Highway. In 1925, the road was given a numerical designation to supplement the name.|$|E

This roadway, which followed a significant portion of Sherk's Road and the Garrison Road, in addition to a concession road built west from Port Colborne and north through Wainfleet village, was designated as Highway3A.|$|E

King case, which involved the 23 miles of the Raquette River between Colton, New York and Raymondville, at an average width of 18 rods (297 feet). The legislature had attempted to declare the river a <b>public</b> <b>highway</b> by eminent domain in 1850, but had not provided appropriate compensation to affected riparian owners. A watermill owned by the defendant King detained plaintiff Morgan’s logs in 1854. Morgan claimed the river was a <b>public</b> <b>highway</b> and therefore King should pay him for his logs.

5|$|Forms of {{traditional}} football have been played throughout Europe and beyond since antiquity. Many of these involved {{handling of the}} ball, and scrummage-like formations. These archaic forms of football, typically classified as mob football, would be played between neighboring towns and villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams, who would clash in a heaving mass of people struggling to drag an inflated pig's bladder by any means possible to markers {{at each end of}} a town. By some accounts, in some such events any means could be used to move the ball towards the goal, as long as it did not lead to manslaughter or murder. These antiquated games went into sharp decline in the 19th century when the Highway Act 1835 was passed banning the playing of football on <b>public</b> <b>highways.</b>|$|E
5|$|Winter service {{vehicles}} are operated by both {{government agencies and}} by private subcontractors. Public works in areas which regularly receive snowfall usually maintain a fleet of their own vehicles or pay retainers to contractors for priority access to vehicles in winter, while cities where snow is a less regular occurrence may simply hire the vehicles as needed. Winter {{service vehicles}} in the United Kingdom are the only road-going vehicles entitled to use red diesel. Though the vehicles still use <b>public</b> <b>highways,</b> {{they are used to}} keep the road network operational, and forcing them to pay extra tax to do so would discourage private contractors from assisting with snow removal on public roads. Winter service vehicle drivers in the United States must hold a Class A or Class B commercial driver's license. Although some agencies in some areas, such as the US state of Minnesota, allow winter service vehicle drivers to operate without any extra training, most provide supplemental lessons to drivers to teach them the most effective and safe methods of snow removal. Many require that trainee drivers ride-along with more experienced drivers, and some even operate specially designed driving simulators, which can safely replicate dangerous winter driving conditions. Other organisations require that all staff have a recognised additional licence or certificate—the United Kingdom Highways Agency for example requires that all staff have both a City & Guilds qualification and a supplemental Winter Maintenance Licence.|$|E

50|$|Plans {{for this}} eastern {{extension}} of State Highway 470 gained {{momentum in the}} 1980s, as Denver moved forward with {{plans for a new}} international airport in its corridor. Recognizing the highway's development potential, a number of local governments joined together to create the E-470 <b>Public</b> <b>Highway</b> Authority, a quasi-governmental entity that would construct the highway. In 1987, the <b>Public</b> <b>Highway</b> Authority Law was passed by the Colorado State Legislature, giving the E-470 <b>Public</b> <b>Highway</b> Authority the power to do everything needed to plan, design, finance, construct, and operate the toll highway. The highway would be financed through tolls, a relative rarity in the western U.S.|$|R

His enjoyment of motoring made him an advocate of funding for <b>public</b> <b>highways.</b> He was also an avid baseball fan, and in 1915 became the first sitting president to attend and throw out the first ball at a World Series game. Wilson had been a center fielder during his Davidson College days and was the Princeton team's assistant manager.

25|$|Special curatores for a term seem to {{have been}} {{appointed}} on occasion, even after the institution of the permanent magistrates bearing that title. The Emperors who succeeded Augustus exercised a vigilant control over the condition of the <b>public</b> <b>highways.</b> Their names occur frequently in the inscriptions to restorers of roads and bridges. Thus, Vespasian, Titus, Domitian, Trajan, and Septimius Severus were commemorated in this capacity at Emérita. The Itinerary of Antoninus, which was probably a work of much earlier date, republished in an improved and enlarged form, under one of the Antonine emperors, remains as standing evidence of the minute care which was bestowed on the service of the public roads.|$|E
25|$|Regional Clubs in the UK {{break down}} into two groups, {{competitive}} and non-competitive. The non-competitive clubs activities generally relate to social events, off road driving or green laning on un-surfaced <b>public</b> <b>highways</b> or 'pay and play' days at off road centres. Competitive clubs are a phenomenon almost exclusively {{found within the}} UK, who {{as well as the}} non-competitive activities detailed above run competitive events such as Tyro, Road Taxed Vehicle (RTV) and Cross Country Vehicle (CCV) trials, winch and recovery challenges or speed events such as Competitive Safaries. All UK competitive events are run within the framework of rules created by the Motor Sports Association (MSA) with further vehicle specific rules applied by the host club or association. Outside of the UK regional clubs are independent and mostly non-competitive.|$|E

25|$|With the {{establishment}} of the provincial highway network on February 26, 1920, the Department of <b>Public</b> <b>Highways,</b> predecessor to today's Ministry of Transportation of Ontario, sought to establish a network of reliable roads through {{the southern part of the}} province. Through July and August 1920, a highway east of Ottawa to Pointe-Fortune at the Quebec boundary, known as the Montreal Road, was assumed by the department. This original routing of Highway17 followed what is now Montreal Road, St Joseph Boulevard, and the Old Montreal Road eastward out of Ottawa; Laurier Street through Rockland; Regional Road55 and 26 between Clarence and Plantagenet; Blue Corner Road and Bay Road (Regional Road 4) to L'Original; John Street, Pharand Street, Eliza Street, Front Road and Main Street to Hawkesbury; the shore of the Ottawa River between Hawkesbury and Pointe-Fortune, and Regional Road17 elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Because it {{involved}} crossing <b>public</b> <b>highways</b> and acquiring land {{from a number}} of different owners a Light Railway Order made under the Light Railways Act 1896 was necessary and application for this was made in November 1925. A Public Inquiry was held by the Light Railway Commissioners in the Assembly Rooms at New Romney on 15 and 16 January 1926. The Minister of Transport indicated his intention to approve the application on 19 February 1926 and The Romney, Hythe & Dymchurch Light Railway Order 1926 was made on 26 May. This incorporated the Romney, Hythe & Dymchurch Light Railway Company as a statutory public utility undertaking, gave it powers to construct and work the proposed railway and also included compulsory purchase powers over the land required (which ultimately had to be used to acquire six plots of land on the proposed route).|$|E
25|$|Motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) are {{consistently}} {{the leading cause}} of work-related fatalities in the U.S. A total of 8,173 workers died in work-related MVCs on <b>public</b> <b>highways</b> from 2003 to 2008, representing 24% of all work-related fatalities for the period. The annual average fatality rate was 0.9 deaths per 100,000 workers. Workers employed in the trucking industry accounted for the greatest number (2,320) and highest rate of highway transportation deaths (19.6 per 100,000 workers). Other U.S. industries with high fatality rates due to work-related MVCs were logging (11.7 per 100,000 workers), wholesale distribution of petroleum products (8.6), waste management (8.5), support activities for mining (7.9), and taxi and limousine services (6.8). The majority of work-related MVC fatalities occurred among occupants of trucks (67% of deaths), especially tractor-trailers (34% of deaths). Nearly half of all fatalities were collisions between two or more vehicles (49%), and 19% were non-collision incidents, especially jack-knifed trucks and overturned vehicles.|$|E
