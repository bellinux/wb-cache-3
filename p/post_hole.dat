500|$|In 1994, in {{response}} to illegal metal detecting near the hoard find, a follow-up excavation of the field {{was carried out by}} the Suffolk County Council Archaeological Service. The hoard burial hole was re-excavated, and a single <b>post</b> <b>hole</b> at the southwest corner was identified; this may have been the location of a marker post to enable the depositors of the cache to locate and recover it in the future. Soil was removed in [...] spits for analysis in the area [...] around the find spot, and metal detectors were used to locate metal artefacts. This excavation recovered 335 items datable to the Roman period, mostly coins but also some box fittings. A series of late Bronze Age or early Iron Age post holes, which may have formed a structure, were found. However, no structural features of the Roman period were detected.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} auger type <b>post</b> <b>hole</b> diggers. These are {{generally}} easier to use, {{and they can}} be used to a much greater depth, as the hole can be dug as deep as {{the entire length of the}} shaft. More importantly, they form a much neater hole, with a well-defined circumference. However, the very fact that the person doing the digging is guaranteed a perfect hole with an auger <b>post</b> <b>hole</b> digger is also its greatest weakness: any given auger style <b>post</b> <b>hole</b> digger can only dig one size hole—a hole with the same diameter as the auger's screw.|$|E

5000|$|A {{post office}} called Grubville {{has been in}} {{operation}} since 1853. The community was named after the occupation of a local [...] "grubber" [...] (i.e. <b>post</b> <b>hole</b> digger).|$|E
50|$|Compact utility {{tractors}} require special, smaller implements than full-sized agricultural tractors. Very common implements {{include the}} box blade, the grader blade, the landscape rake, the <b>post</b> <b>hole</b> digger (or <b>post</b> <b>hole</b> auger), the rotary cutter (slasher or a brush hog), a mid- or rear-mount finish mower, a broadcast seeder, a subsoiler and the rototiller (rotary tiller). In northern climates, a rear-mounted snow blower is very common; some smaller CUT models {{are available with}} front-mounted snow blowers powered by mid-PTO shafts. Implement brands outnumbere tractor brands, so CUT owners have {{a wide selection of}} implements.|$|E

50|$|Excavations at Manor Farm in Lower Pennington found {{evidence}} of medieval settlement including hearths, ditches gullies and <b>post</b> <b>holes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Three {{parallel}} rows of <b>post</b> <b>holes</b> {{indicated a}} rectangular structure 23.5 m by 5 m, probably a timber hall {{similar to the}} Neolithic long house found at Balbridie. Smaller <b>post</b> <b>holes</b> and stake holes define eight to twelve round or oval structures, possibly round houses, as well as six gully-defined structures with numerous stake-holes. A large oval feature, approximately 1.8 m by 1.2 m, contained heavily retired pottery shards and is thought {{likely to have been}} a kiln. Possible ritualistic landscape features include a massive post-pit and <b>post</b> <b>holes</b> or pits forming arcs. At the west edge of the site, adjacent to Station Brae, part of a probable palisade was found. Medieval finds included a trackway, ditches, pits and remains of numerous structures including kilns and a 4 m diameter wattle and daub walled granary.|$|R

50|$|Commonly {{referred}} to as <b>Post</b> <b>Hole</b> Diggers and Earth Augers, Tractor PTO Augers are implements {{used in conjunction with}} a tractor's Power Take Off drive, and a tractor's 3 point hitch.|$|E
50|$|There are {{different}} kinds of <b>post</b> <b>hole</b> diggers. The pictured type is jabbed into {{the ground in the}} open position until the blades are buried. At that point the handles are pulled apart to close the tool and grab the chunk of soil loosened. They are then pulled out of the ground with the chunk of soil. The process is repeated until the hole is deep enough, or until the hole is so deep and narrow that the handles can no longer be pulled apart fully. This is one of the weaknesses of this kind of <b>post</b> <b>hole</b> digger.|$|E
50|$|The dig site {{consists}} {{of large numbers}} of pits and <b>post</b> <b>holes</b> whose associated material has been subdivided typologically into five phases.|$|R
50|$|Four of {{the halls}} are simple, {{rectangular}} areas which {{are defined by}} their single row of <b>post</b> <b>holes.</b> Another, Hall No. 2, was {{more complex than the}} others, having an internal division and double post-holes along the length. No. 7 was also different because it was built from a sleeper beam and larger <b>post</b> <b>holes,</b> while Hall No. 5 cannot be clearly defined because it lay in area that had seen multiple features rebuilt on top of it.|$|R
50|$|Evidence of Saxon {{settlement}} was unearthed in 2001 and finds evidencing mediaeval occupation include large <b>post</b> <b>holes</b> and a post-Roman ditch filled with pottery fragments.|$|R
50|$|The {{dominant}} features at los Guachimontones are circular stepped pyramids in {{the middle}} of circular building complexes. The 60 ft tall pyramid at Circle 2 has 13 high steps leading to an upper level, which was then topped with another 4 high steps. A <b>post</b> <b>hole</b> was located at the very highest level, most likely for Volador ceremonies. The pyramids may also have supported small temples.|$|E
50|$|In a multi-occupant site it {{is almost}} {{impossible}} to differentiate the artifacts of one family from another except. There is one deposit of artifacts that has been attributed to the Crowd family occupation and dates to the period from 1842 to 1860. This is the lower portion of a <b>post</b> <b>hole</b> located between the house and the well, part of whose contents seem to be sandwiched into the occupation years of the Crowd family.|$|E
50|$|An auger {{used for}} digging post holes is called an 'earth auger', 'handheld power earth drill', 'soil auger', or 'mechanized <b>post</b> <b>hole</b> digger'. This kind of auger {{can be a}} {{manually}} turned, handheld device, or powered by an electric motor or internal-combustion engine, possibly attached to a tractor (being provided with power by the tractor engine's power take-off as shown). Handheld augers {{can also be used}} for making holes for garden planting.|$|E

50|$|Excavations {{carried out}} under Denis Grant King, from 1959 onwards, turned over some good {{examples}} of Iron Age drystone walling, and found remains of a much earlier structure that existed at the north east entrance, indicated by drystone revetments within the northern rampart. In a second stage the entrance was remodelled and widened. At the north west entrance, four staggered post holes were uncovered {{as well as a}} cylindrical cavity 0.66m deep, interpreted as a gate <b>post</b> <b>hole.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Building D1 was {{described}} by Hope-Taylor as being an example of [...] "strange incompetence" [...] due to the various mistakes that apparently occurred during its construction. Although likely intended to be rectangular, from the <b>post</b> <b>hole</b> evidence {{it is apparent that}} the finished result was rhomboidal, and it appears that not long after construction, the building collapsed or was demolished, to be replaced by another hall, which also exhibited various structural problems such as wonky walls.|$|E
50|$|In {{the next}} stage, using the {{specific}} bur, dentist prepares an additional circle {{ring around the}} tooth canal. The post and core can then be constructed either by a direct technique or by an indirect technique. In the direct technique a pattern is fabricated in the mouth using either inlay wax or a burn out resin (e.g. Duralay) which is then sent to the laboratory for casting. For the direct technique, which is more widely used, an impression is taken using a matched plastic impression post placed in the prepared <b>post</b> <b>hole.</b>|$|E
50|$|There is some {{evidence}} to support the treaty hypothesis, based on the grave finds of the period. For example, the excavation of one of the cemeteries, at Rookery Hill at Bishopstone, East Sussex, yielded late Roman or insular Roman metalwork including a Quoit Brooch Style buckle, which would indicate settlement here to the early 5th century.Subsequent excavations revealed a considerable area of Saxon buildings. Of the 22 buildings excavated three were sunken huts, 17 are rectangular founded on individual <b>post</b> <b>holes,</b> one is represented by <b>post</b> <b>holes</b> between which are beam slots, and one by eight single large posts.|$|R
50|$|The {{architecture}} of phases A and B (8200-7500 BC, calibrated) is characterised by circular wattle and daub structures, with <b>post</b> <b>holes</b> {{cut into the}} bedrock. Some deep pits may have served as wells.|$|R

50|$|Between 1992 and 1996, a {{reconstruction}} of the village was completed in Bland County, Virginia, near the original site. The life-sized reconstruction {{is based on the}} <b>post</b> <b>hole</b> pits, postal stain and post molds that were uncovered during the survey, which indicated a pallisaded enclosure and some dozen circular buildings. Several Native American graves of various ages and genders were also discovered, some placed inside the pallisades, and some placed outside the enclosure. These grave sites are accurately positioned and marked in the reconstructed village, along with a description of the burial position and any grave goods also discovered.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of {{plans to build a}} road through the middle of the castle site, archaeological {{excavations}} took place in 1976 and 1982. These uncovered moats and a <b>post</b> <b>hole.</b> The pottery that was discovered was dated to the 13th and 14th century. Inside the rampart shards of pottery from the 9th to the 11th century were also found along with evidence of a storage building. This could have been related to Old Ahlden (Alt Ahlden) recorded in 1295, which fell into ruin and whose remains may later have been used to build the castle ramparts.|$|E
50|$|In the two frescos of the Pauline Chapel, The Crucifixion of St. Peter and The Conversion of Saul, Michelangelo {{has used}} the various groups of figures to convey a complex narrative. In the Crucifixion of Peter {{soldiers}} busy themselves about their assigned duty of digging a <b>post</b> <b>hole</b> and raising the cross while various people look on and discuss the events. A group of horrified women cluster in the foreground, while another group of Christians is led by a tall man to witness the events. In the right foreground, Michelangelo {{walks out of the}} painting with an expression of disillusionment.|$|E
