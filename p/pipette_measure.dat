Material and Method: This descriptive study was carried out on 99 mothers while they bought prescribed OPA for their children from a pharmacy in Istanbul. The method of OPA preparation of each mother was observed. The amount of the prepared suspension was measured with 10 ml glass <b>pipettes.</b> <b>Measured</b> doses in the range of ± 1 ml of the prescribed dose were accepted as the correct dose. Results: Twenty-seven point three percent of the mothers' measurements were underscaled and 2 % of their measurements were overscaled compared to the required amounts (p< 0. 001). High educational status and using a syringe for scaling was found to be related with a correct dose measurement of OPA. Consclusion: We conclude that mothers who participated in this study were not able to prepare OPA appropriately, with less than or over the required dose.

However, after the process of extraction the solution turns brown due to tannins that contained in the stevia leaf. Oneof the processto eliminate tanninfrom the solution is by using activated carbon to absorb tannins. Materials used in this research is dried stevia leaves, water, activated carbon, and citric acid.

40|$|In {{this study}} we tested the {{hypothesis}} that extracellular ATP regulates {{the function of the}} pericyte-containing retinal microvessels. Pericytes, which are more numerous in the retina than in any other tissue, are abluminally located cells that may adjust capillary perfusion by contracting and relaxing. At present, knowledge of the vasoactive molecules that regulate pericyte function is limited. Here, we focused on the actions of extracellular ATP because this nucleotide is a putative glial-to-vascular signal, as well as being a substance released by activated platelets and injured cells. In microvessels freshly isolated from the adult rat retina, we monitored ionic currents via perforated-patch <b>pipettes,</b> <b>measured</b> intracellular calcium levels with the use of fura- 2, and visualized microvascular contractions with the aid of time-lapse photography. We found that ATP induced depolarizing changes in the ionic currents, increased calcium levels and caused pericytes to contract. P 2 X 7 receptors and UTP-activated receptors mediated these effects. Consistent with ATP serving as a vasoconstrictor for the pericyte-containing microvasculature of the retina, the microvascular lumen narrowed when an adjacent pericyte contracted. In addition, the sustained activation of P 2 X 7 receptors inhibited cell-to-cell electrotonic transmission within the microvascular networks. Thus, ATP not only affects the contractility of individual pericytes, but also appears to regulate the spatial and temporal dynamics of the vasomotor response...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the mechanisms by which angiotensin II alters the physiology of the pericyte-containing microvasculature of the retina. Despite evidence that this vasoactive signal regulates capillary perfusion by inducing abluminal pericytes to contract and thereby microvascular lumens to constrict, little is known about the events linking angiotensin exposure with pericyte contraction. Here, using microvessels freshly isolated from the adult rat retina, we monitored pericyte currents via perforated-patch <b>pipettes,</b> <b>measured</b> pericyte calcium levels with fura- 2 and visualized pericyte contractions and lumen constrictions by time-lapse photography. We found that angiotensin activates nonspecific cation (NSC) and calcium-activated chloride channels; the opening of these channels induces a depolarization that is sufficient to activate the voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) expressed in the retinal microvasculature. Associated with these changes in ion channel activity, intracellular calcium levels rise, pericytes contract and microvascular lumens narrow. Our experiments revealed that an influx of calcium through the NSC channels is an essential step linking the activation of AT 1 angiotensin receptors with pericyte contraction. Although not required in order for angiotensin to induce pericytes to contract, calcium entry via VDCCs serves to enhance the contractile response of these cells. In addition to activating nonspecific cation, calcium-activated chloride and voltage-dependent calcium channels, angiotensin II also causes the functional uncoupling of pericytes from their microvascular neighbours. This inhibition of gap junction-mediated intercellular communication suggests a previously unappreciated complexity in the spatiotemporal dynamics of the microvascular response to angiotensin II...|$|R

Due to high inaccuracies at volumes {{of less than}} 1 [mu]L, a nanoliter pipette could truly change the way people research. This experimental nanoliter pipette uses a regulating CAM mechanism and a diaphragm to displace small amounts of fluid. The CAM mechanism {{has the ability to}} be adjusted to different steps, each of which controls the amount of working fluid to be displaced in a sealed chamber. In response to this, the diaphragm displaces a smaller volumetric amount of fluid outside the chamber. A deamplification ratio is defined by the ratio of the volume displaced by the diaphragm to the volume displaced by the CAM mechanism. The deamplification ratio is adjustable by changing the setting of the variable CAM mechanism or exchanging different tip assemblies which hold different sized diaphragms.

40|$|Cyclic GMP (cGMP) is the {{intracellular}} messenger that mediates phototransduction in retinal rods. As photoisomerizations of rhodopsin molecules {{are local}} events, the longitudinal diffusion of cGMP in the rod outer segment {{should be a}} contributing factor to {{the response of the}} cell to light. We have employed the truncated rod outer segment preparation from bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) and tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) to measure the cGMP diffusion coefficient. In this preparation, the distal portion of a rod outer segment was drawn into a suction <b>pipette</b> for <b>measuring</b> membrane current, {{and the rest of the}} cell was then sheared off with a glass probe, allowing bath cGMP to diffuse into the outer segment and activate the cGMP-gated channels on the surface membrane. Addition and removal of bath cGMP were fast enough to produce effectively step changes in cGMP concentration at the open end of the outer segment. When cGMP hydrolysis is inhibited by isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), the equation for the diffusion of cGMP inside the truncated rod outer segment has a simple analytical solution, which we have used to analyze the rise and decay kinetics of the cGMP-elicited currents. From these measurements we have obtained a cGMP diffusion coefficient of approximately 70 x 10 (- 8) cm 2 s- 1 for bullfrog rods and approximately 60 x 10 (- 8) cm 2 s- 1 for tiger salamander rods. These values are six to seven times lower than the expected value in aqueous solution. The estimated diffusion coefficient is the same at high (20 - 1000 microM) and low (5 - 10 microM) concentrations of cGMP, suggesting no significant effect from buffering over these concentration ranges...|$|R

Less force was required to separate doublets of L cells expressing nectin- 1 or nectin- 3 than to separate doublets of E-cadherin-expressing cells. Heterodimers formed between cells expressing nectin- 1 or nectin- 3 adhered more strongly than homodimers. Nectin- 3 that does not trans-interact with nectin- 1 inhibited E-cadherin-mediated adhesion.

Currently, pHi {{is believed to}} be the major signal in the chemosensitive (CS) response; however, a new model has been proposed suggesting that multiple factors (such as Ca++, CO 2, pHi, and pHo) contribute to the CS response. While there is evidence for a significant role of pHi in the CS response, we hypothesize that hypercapnic acidosis (HA) can still increase FR even with no change in pHi. To test this hypothesis, we developed a method to clamp pHi using rapid diffusion of the weak acid, acetic acid, through the cell membrane according to the relationship: pHi = pHo + log ([C 2 H 3 O 2] i/[C 2 H 3 O 2]o).

We assessed whether AP measurements in ventricular-like and atrial-like hiPSC-CMs could be improved through a simple, highly reproducible dynamic clamp approach to provide these cells with a substantial I-K 1 (computed in real time according to the actual membrane potential and injected through the patch-clamp <b>pipette).</b> APs were <b>measured</b> at 1 Hz using perforated patch-clamp methodology, both in control cells and in cells treated with all-trans retinoic acid (RA) during the differentiation process {{to increase the number}} of cells with atrial-like APs.

Furthermore, the variability of several AP parameters decreased upon I-K 1 injection. Computer simulations with models of ventricular-like and atrial-like hiPSC-CMs demonstrated the importance of selecting an appropriate synthetic I-K 1.

40|$|Many {{important}} biological {{activities like}} electrical impulses in nerve cells and cell metabolism are {{strongly related to}} the transport of molecules {{into and out of}} biological cells. Consequently, there is great interest in understanding these cellular transport mechanisms. The patch clamp technique gives a quantitative insight in cellular transport. This method generally uses a glass <b>pipette</b> to <b>measure</b> the electrochemical current across the cell membrane. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), on the other hand, has been applied to study the topography of membranes. To get a quantitative and qualitative comprehension of the cellular transport it would be advantageous to observe the topographic and local electrical information simultaneously. This could be achieved by a setup that combines the conventional patch clamp technique and AFM. However, the combination and implementation of these two techniques requires the contrivance of new tools. This thesis is devoted to the fabrication and characterization of such tools. In a first step the glass pipette used in patch clamp {{has been replaced by a}} planar sample support, which is more adapted to the requirements of AFM. The supports feature a nanometer scaled aperture in order to enable measurements on suspended membrane patches. Their electrical, mechanical and biological characteristics were investigated and designed to fit the requirements of the aimed application. In order to keep the biological cells functional, the experiments need to be performed in a liquid environment. Therefore a special conductive AFM probe allowing local electrical measurements in liquid environment has been designed and realized. The probe is electrically insulated except at the very apex of the tip, which has a radius of curvature smaller than 10 nm. The imaging quality of the probe has been assessed and nanometer lateral resolution on biological membranes has been achieved. The electrochemical behavior of the tip has been investigated by cyclic voltammetry. Moreover the probes were employed to perform combined AFM and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) experiments. It was possible to simultaneously acquire the topography and the electrochemical current images with a lateral resolution below 10 nm. Measurements through the submicron scaled aperture in the planar sample support were used to investigate the distance dependency of the electrochemical current. First measurements on biological cells absorbed on the planar sample support showed an excellent correlation between topography and electrochemical current. In order to gain a deeper insight into the relation between the tip geometry and the resulting electrochemical current and imaging resolution, a finite element simulation model has been built. The simulations agreed with the measurements and theory. This results proved the accuracy of the finite element model...|$|R

Whole-cell K+ currents and single ATP-dependent potassium (KATP) channels were analysed in inspiratory neurones. In cell-attached patches, KATP channels had a conductance of 75 pS and showed inward rectification. Their gating was voltage dependent and channel activity decreased with membrane hyperpolarization. Using Ca 2 +-containing <b>pipette</b> solutions the <b>measured</b> conductance was lower (50 pS at 1. 5 mM Ca 2 +), indicating tonic inhibition by extracellular Ca 2 +. KATP channel activity was reversibly potentiated during hypoxia. Maximal effects were attained 3 - 4 min after oxygen removal from the bath. Hypoxic potentiation of open probability {{was due to}} an increase in channel open times and a decrease in channel closed times. In inside-out patches and symmetrical K+ concentrations, channel currents reversed at about 0 mV. Channel activity was blocked by ATP (300 - 600 μM), glibenclamide (10 - 70 μM) and tolbutamide (100 - 300 μM). In the presence of diazoxide (10 - 60 μM), the activity of KATP channels was increased both in inside-out, outside-out and cell-attached patches. In outside-out patches, that remained within the slice after excision, the activity of KATP channels was enhanced by hypoxia, an effect that could be mediated by a release of endogenous neuromodulators. The whole-cell K+ current (IK) was inactivated at negative membrane potentials, which resembled the voltage dependence of KATP channel gating. After 3 - 4 min of hypoxia, K+ currents at both hyperpolarizing and depolarizing membrane potentials increased. IK was partially blocked by tolbutamide (100 - 300 μM) and in its presence, hypoxic potentiation of IK was abolished.

In addition, we measured the time-dependent binding and release of fluorescently labeled WGA to single erythrocytes with a laser microfluorometry system. The results showed that the stiffening of the erythrocyte membrane and binding of fluorescently labeled WGA to the membrane surface followed the same concentration and time dependencies. The threshold concentration for membrane stiffening was at approximately 0. 1 microgram/ml where the time course to reach equilibrium was close to 1 h. The maximal stiffening (almost 30 -fold over the normal membrane elastic modulus) occurred in concentrations greater than 2 micrograms/ml where the time to reach equilibrium took less than 1 min. The WGA binding also altered the normal elastic membrane behavior into an inelastic, plastic-like response which indicated that mechanical extension of the membrane caused an increase in cross-linking within the surface plane.
