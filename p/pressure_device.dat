25|$|For {{patients}} who cannot use a continuous positive airway <b>pressure</b> <b>device,</b> the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2014 granted pre-market approval for an upper airway stimulation system that senses respiration and delivers mild electrical stimulation to the hypoglossal nerve {{in order to}} increase muscle tone {{at the back of the}} tongue so it will not collapse over the airway. The device includes a handheld patient controller to allow it to be switched on before sleep and is powered by an implantable pulse generator, similar to one used for cardiac rhythm management. Approval for this active implantable neuromodulation device was preceded by a clinical trial whose results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.|$|E

30|$|While {{this study}} focused on hemorrhage, there is a {{theoretical}} benefit of EVA in other hemodynamic states that would benefit from a temporary increase in venous return. Other negative <b>pressure</b> <b>devices</b> have increased cardiac output in patients with Fontan physiology, cardiac tamponade, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation [22 – 24]. Moreover, by decreasing intrathoracic pressure, other negative <b>pressure</b> <b>devices</b> have increased cerebral drainage and increased cerebral perfusion [24, 25]. The increase in venous return and cerebral perfusion pressure are theoretical advantages for using EVA as a transtracheal rescue ventilation system during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Conversely, it may be problematic to use EVA as a ventilator strategy during airway surgery in patients with congestive heart failure. These patients {{are less likely to}} tolerate increases in preload and left ventricular afterload from EVA.|$|R

40|$|From {{a safety}} standpoint, {{regardless}} of plant or facility type, {{the most important}} pieces of equipment are the <b>pressure</b> relief <b>devices.</b> The most critical characteristics of a <b>pressure</b> relief <b>device</b> are its set pressure and the related relieving capacity. The Set Pressure of a <b>pressure</b> relief <b>device</b> is defined as that value of increasing inlet static pressure at which the discharge becomes continuous (ASME PTC 25 - 1994, Performance Test Codes). To preclude an unsafe overpressure situation, the set pressure of the <b>pressure</b> relief <b>device</b> must not exceed the {{maximum allowable working pressure}} of the equipment or system being protected. Because of testing facility limitations, size or pressure, pressure relief valves intended for elevated temperature service are often set using ambient temperature air. Adjustments are made to the ambient valve opening pressures to compensate for the temperature differences. The extent of the adjustments to the pressure relief valve set pressure is important to ensure the valve will provide the required overpressure protection at the elevated in-service temperature...|$|R

In these cases intermittent a pneumatic <b>pressure</b> <b>device</b> may be used or more simple compression stockings. Leg exercise will also be effective in promoting blood circulation in the legs.

40|$|AIM This study aims {{to compare}} the effect of three CPR prompt and {{feedback}} devices on quality of chest compressions amongst healthcare providers. METHODS A single blinded, randomised controlled trial compared a <b>pressure</b> sensor/metronome <b>device</b> (CPREzy), an accelerometer device (Phillips Q-CPR) and simple metronome {{on the quality of}} chest compressions on a manikin by trained rescuers. The primary outcome was compression depth. Secondary outcomes were compression rate, proportion of chest compressions with inadequate depth, incomplete release and user satisfaction. RESULTS The <b>pressure</b> sensor <b>device</b> improved compression depth (37. 24 - 43. 64 mm, p= 0. 02), the accelerometer device decreased chest compression depth (37. 38 - 33. 19 mm, p= 0. 04) whilst the metronome had no effect (39. 88 mm vs. 40. 64 mm, p= 0. 802). Compression rate fell with all <b>devices</b> (<b>pressure</b> sensor <b>device</b> 114. 68 - 98. 84 min(- 1), p= 0. 001, accelerometer 112. 04 - 102. 92 min(- 1), p= 0. 072 and metronome 108. 24 min(- 1) vs. 99. 36 min(- 1), p= 0. 009). The <b>pressure</b> sensor feedback <b>device</b> reduced the proportion of compressions with inadequate depth (0. 52 vs. 0. 24, p= 0. 013) whilst the accelerometer device and metronome did not have a statistically significant effect. Incomplete release of compressions was common, but unaffected by the CPR feedback devices. Users preferred the accelerometer and metronome <b>devices</b> over the <b>pressure</b> sensor <b>device.</b> A post hoc study showed that de-activating the voice prompt on the accelerometer device prevented the deterioration in compression quality seen in the main study. CONCLUSION CPR feedback devices vary in their ability to improve performance. In this study the <b>pressure</b> sensor <b>device</b> improved compression depth, whilst the accelerometer device reduced it and metronome had no effect...|$|R
