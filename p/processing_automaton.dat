40|$|Information about {{wheel loader}} usage {{can be used}} in several ways to {{optimize}} customer adaption. First, optimizing the configuration and component sizing of a wheel loader to customer needs can lead to a significant improvement in e. g. fuel efficiency and cost. Second, relevant driving cycles {{to be used in the}} development of wheel loaders can be extracted from usage data. Third, on-line usage identification opens up for the possibility of implementing advanced look-ahead control strategies for wheel loader operation. The main objective here is to develop an on-line algorithm that automatically, using production sensors only, can extract information about the usage of a machine. Two main challenges are that sensors are not located with respect to this task and that significant usage disturbances typically occur during operation. The proposed method is based on a combination of several individually simple techniques using signal <b>processing,</b> state <b>automaton</b> techniques, and parameter estimation algorithms. The approach is found to berobust when evaluated on measured data of wheel loaders loading gravel and shot rock...|$|R
40|$|Optimizing the {{configuration}} of a wheel loader to customer needs {{can lead to a}} significant increase in efficiency with respect to fuel economy, cost, component dimensioning etc. Experience show that even modest customer adaptation can save around 20 % of fuel cost. A key motivator for this work is that wheel loader manufacturers in general does not have full information about customer usage of the machine and the main objective here is to develop an algorithm that automatically, using only production sensors, extracts information about the usage of a machine at a specific customer site. Two main challenges are that sensors are not located with respect to this task and the significant usage disturbances that typically occur during operation. The proposed solution is a robust method, based on a mix of techniques using basic signal <b>processing,</b> state <b>automaton</b> techniques, and parameter estimation algorithms. A key property of the method is the method of combining, individually very simple, basic techniques in a scheme where robustness are introduced. The approach is evaluated on measured data of a wheel loader loading gravel and shot rock...|$|R
40|$|A tree {{automatic}} {{structure is}} a structure whose domain can be encoded by a regular tree language such that each relation is recognisable by a finite <b>automaton</b> <b>processing</b> tuples of trees synchronously. Words {{can be regarded}} as specific simple trees and a structure is word automatic if it is encodable using only these trees. The question naturally arises whether a given tree automatic structure is already word automatic. We prove that this problem is decidable for tree automatic scattered linear orderings. Moreover, we show that in case of a positive answer a word automatic presentation is computable from the tree automatic presentation. Comment: 19 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
40|$|A {{deterministic}} {{finite-state automaton}} (FSA) is an abstract sequential machine that reads the symbols comprising an input word {{one at a}} time. An FSA is symmetric if its output is independent of {{the order in which}} the input symbols are read, i. e., if the output is invariant under permutations of the input. We show how to convert a symmetric FSA A into an automatonlike divide-and-conquer process whose intermediate results are no larger than the size of A’s memory. In comparison, a similar result for general FSA’s has been long known via functional composition, but entails an exponential increase in memory size. The new result has applications to parallel processing and symmetric FSA networks.

40|$|AbstractWe {{introduce}} a new formal computational model designed for studying the information transfer among the generations of offspring-producing evolving machines — so-called autopoietic automata. These {{can be seen as}} nondeterministic finite state transducers whose “program” can become a subject of their own <b>processing.</b> An autopoietic <b>automaton</b> can algorithmically generate an offspring controlled by a program which is a modification of its parent’s program. Autopoietic automata offer a neat framework for investigating computational and complexity issues in the evolutionary self-reproducing processes. We show that the computational power of lineages of autopoietic automata is equal to that of an interactive nondeterministic Turing machine. We also prove that there exists an autopoietic automaton giving rise to an unlimited evolution, provided that suitable inputs are delivered to individual automata. However, the problem of sustainable evolution, asking whether for an arbitrary autopoietic automaton and arbitrary inputs there is an infinite lineage of its offspring, is undecidable...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Weighted automata map input {{words to}} {{numerical}} values. Applications of weighted automata include formal verification of quantitative properties, {{as well as}} text, speech, and image <b>processing.</b> A weighted <b>automaton</b> is defined {{with respect to a}} semiring. For the tropical semiring, the weight of a run is the sum of the weights of the transitions taken along the run, and the value of a word is the minimal weight of an accepting run on it. In the 90 ’s, Krob studied the decidability of problems on rational series defined with respect to the tropical semiring. Rational series are strongly related to weighted automata, and Krob’s results apply to them. In particular, it follows from Krob’s results that the universality problem (that is, deciding whether the values of all words are below some threshold) is decidable for weighted automata defined with respect to the tropical semiring with domain ∪ {∞}, and that the equality problem is undecidable when the domain is ∪ {∞}. In this paper we continue the study of the borders of decidability in weighted automata, describe alternative and direct proofs of the above results, and tighten them further. Unlike the proofs of Krob, which are algebraic in their nature, our proofs stay in the terrain of state machines, and the reduction is from the halting problem of a two-counter machine. This enables us to significantly simplify Krob’s reasoning, make the undecidability result accessible to the automata-theoretic community, and strengthen it to apply already to a very simple class of automata: all the states are accepting, there are no initial nor final weights, and all the weights on the transitions are from the set {− 1, 0, 1 }. The fact we work directly with the automata enables us to tighten also the decidability results and to show that the universality problem for weighted automata defined with respect to the tropical semiring with domain ∪ {∞}, and ≥ 0 in fact even with domain ∪ {∞}, is PSPACE-complete. Our results thus draw a sharper picture about the decidability of decision problems for weighted automata, in both the front of containment vs. universality and the front of the ∪ {∞} vs. the ∪ {∞} domains. ...|$|R
