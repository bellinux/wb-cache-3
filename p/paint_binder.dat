5000|$|The Modern Paints Project is a {{collaborative}} research project {{that began in}} response to the various new materials that contemporary artists are using in their work. Major collaborators include the Tate London, The National Gallery in Washington, DC, the Smithsonian Museum Conservation Institute, and several other international and domestic museums and cultural institutions. After 1920, cellulose nitrate was successfully converted into a form that {{could be used as a}} <b>paint</b> <b>binder.</b> Following this, the paints that artists were using were constantly changing and were composed of synthetic binders. While these various paints were utilized by several artists in the 20th century and up to the present day, the knowledge regarding how well any of these modern paints would withstand the passing of time is still extremely limited. Research is needed to determine the extent of the probable deterioration. [...] In 2004, Thomas Learner, a senior conservation scientist at the Tate, London, published the findings of his research into the types of techniques currently being used to test and learn more about the synthetic resins and materials used in many modern commercial paints.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, {{acrylic paint}} is very elastic, which {{prevents}} cracking from occurring. Acrylic <b>paint's</b> <b>binder</b> is acrylic polymer emulsion - as this <b>binder</b> dries, the <b>paint</b> remains flexible.|$|R
30|$|Concerning the <b>paint</b> <b>binder’s</b> distribution, SEM–EDS {{analysis}} in different layers, {{suggests that the}} two binders, polysaccharide and proteinaceous, may have been applied as mixture and not separately as binder and varnish.|$|R

40|$|A noncontact {{technique}} is described that uses atomic oxygen, generated under low {{pressure in the}} presence of nitrogen, to remove soot and charred varnish from the surface of a painting. The process, which involves surface oxidation, permits control of the amount of surface material removed. The effectiveness of the process was evaluated by reflectance measurements from selected areas made during the removal of soot from acrylic gesso, ink on paper, and varnished oil paint substrates. For the latter substrate, treatment also involved the removal of damaged varnish and <b>paint</b> <b>binder</b> from the surface...|$|E
30|$|It is {{generally}} {{extremely difficult to}} detect and identify <b>paint</b> <b>binders</b> on architectural elements from archaeological contexts, since the organic components of the polychromy have usually deteriorated due to its exposure to the elements, in contrast to, e.g. material from tombs, which has been better protected from the environment.|$|R
30|$|The {{absence of}} protein {{components}} in the other fragments needs to {{be interpreted with caution}} because of the different analytical method used for analysis. However, the possibility that different <b>paint</b> <b>binders</b> (plant gums in certain areas and plant gum in mixture with/coated by a protein material in others) were specifically used in combination with specific pigments should be taken into consideration and needs to be explored further by focusing on pigment identification in combination with identification of binding media.|$|R
30|$|PHAs can be {{processed}} in existing polymer-processing equipment {{and can be}} converted into injection-molded components: film and sheet, fibers, laminates, and coated articles; nonwoven fabrics, synthetic paper products, disposable items, feminine hygiene products, adhesives, waxes, <b>paints,</b> <b>binders,</b> and foams. Metabolix has received FDA clearance for use of PHAs in food contact applications. These materials are suitable {{for a wide range}} of food packing applications including caps and closures, disposable items such as forks, spoons, knives, tubs, trays, and hot cup lids, and products such as housewares, cosmetics, and medical packaging (Philip et al. 2007).|$|R
30|$|Honey and beeswax was readily {{available}} in ancient Egypt {{and would have been}} available as a <b>paint</b> <b>binder.</b> Among the earliest evidence of beekeeping is a relief in the 5 th Dynasty sun temple of Niuserra at Abu Gurob, which depicts beehives and honey harvesting [31]. However, so far there are only few attestations of its use as a binder. A filling material from a 21 st Dynasty sarcophagus was bound by an unknown gum mixed with honey and a paint sample from the same artefact was apparently bound with honey alone [27, 32].|$|E
30|$|Considering the {{evidence}} provided by these results, the best {{chances for a}} clear identification of the <b>paint</b> <b>binder</b> used in real manuscript illuminations {{are tied to the}} possibility of collecting spectra in areas painted with simple oxide and sulphide-based pigments such as minium, orpiment and vermillion, all three of which were used extensively by medieval and Renaissance illuminators. This is particularly true when the pictorial layer is thick enough to (at least partially) hide the parchment’s spectral contribution and/or when the paint layer has not been modelled with white carbonates.|$|E
30|$|Due to {{the high}} {{inorganic}} to organic ratio and the alteration processes of the organic materials (as suggested by the detection of calcium oxalate) {{it was not possible}} to identify spectral bands clearly ascribable to a <b>paint</b> <b>binder.</b> Some of the spectral features assigned to the inorganic components overlap with the absorption bands of polysaccharide materials (broad absorption between 3500 and 3000  cm− 1, absorptions around 1620 and 1100  cm− 1) and the absorption around 1558  cm− 1 might be interpreted as the amide II band of a protein material [64].|$|E
50|$|Pastels are a dry {{medium and}} produce {{a great deal of}} dust, which can cause {{respiratory}} irritation. More seriously, pastels use the same pigments as artists' paints, many of which are toxic. For example, exposure to cadmium pigments, which are common and popular bright yellows, oranges, and reds, can lead to cadmium poisoning. Pastel artists, who use the pigments without a strong <b>painting</b> <b>binder,</b> are especially susceptible to such poisoning. For this reason, many modern pastels are made using substitutions for cadmium, chromium, and other toxic pigments, while retaining the traditional pigment names.|$|R
30|$|For the dual-modal scanner a point-based FORS {{spectral}} radiometer {{was chosen}} to cover the 350 – 2500  nm at high spectral sampling (1 and 2  nm). The rationale for collecting spectra over this full range is because electronic transitions in the near UV/visible spectral region {{can be used to}} identify numerous inorganic and organic pigments. The spectral features in the 1000 – 2500  nm near-infrared region provide information on vibrational transitions (combination and overtone features) of various functional groups, such as hydroxyl, carbonate and methyl groups, allowing for more complete identification of pigments and even <b>paint</b> <b>binders</b> [7].|$|R
40|$|A {{chemical}} {{investigation of}} the organic <b>paint</b> <b>binders</b> of the Giant Buddhas of Bāmiyān was performed using an analytical approach based on mass spectrometry, combining traditional gas chromatography/mass spectrometry protocols with advanced proteomics methodologies. The research was carried out on a selection of rescued fragments. The data revealed the use of egg proteins as the <b>paint</b> <b>binders</b> of the original layers, {{in accordance with the}} traditional use of this proteinaceous medium in antiquity, spanning from the Mediterranean basin to the Far East, and already in the Bronze Age. Egg tempera was thus known to artists of the region in the first centuries AD, probably also due to the position of the Bāmiyān valley, which was connected to the Silk Road. Milk was found in the first historical overpaintings. A new proteomics approach was used, which was able to identify the source of the milk proteins present in the restoration layers, despite their age and degradation. In particular cow's and goat's milk were both found, in agreement with the documented presence of rich pastures in the Bāmiyān valley when the historical restorations were carried out. Investigating the materials of the Giant Buddhas not only enabled us to obtain isolated data on these invaluable works of art, which are now lost, but contributes to understanding the big "puzzle" of our past and the development of our culture, by implementing and supporting written sources, stylistic and anthropological studies with molecular data...|$|R

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether workable flesh-toned paints can be made from colourants from aphid insects and ivy gum using medieval gum and scale insect recipes. The processes of extracting pigment from the lesser-known ivy, wormwood and the giant willow aphids were explored, whilst <b>paint</b> <b>binder</b> and colourant was obtained from ivy plant gum. This work follows on experiences applying past practices derived from painters’ to illuminators’ technical manuals using similar processes once used for making colourants from historical scale insects, such as kermes and cochineal. The experimental reconstructions created by using selected locally sourced aphid insects and ivy gum, indicate that an aphid-stain and dye-based colourant which was fixed to calcium carbonate can form a successful paint source.|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to completely destroying artwork, fires in museums and public buildings can soil a displayed artwork {{with so much}} accumulated soot that {{it can no longer}} be used for study or be enjoyed by the public. In situations where the surface has not undergone extensive charring or melting, restoration can be attempted. However, soot deposits can be very difficult to remove from some types of painted surfaces, particularly when the paint is fragile or flaking or when the top surface of the <b>paint</b> <b>binder</b> has been damaged. Restoration typically involves the use of organic solvents to clean the surface, but these solvents may cause the paint layers to swell or leach out. Also, immersion of the surface or swabbing during solvent cleaning may move or remove pigment through mechanical contact, especially if the fire damage extends into the <b>paint</b> <b>binder.</b> A noncontact technique of removing organic deposits from surfaces was developed out of NASA research on the effects of oxygen atoms on various materials. Atomic oxygen is present in the atmosphere surrounding the Earth at the altitudes where satellites typically orbit. It can react chemically with surface coatings or deposits that contain carbon. In the reaction, the carbon is converted to carbon monoxide and some carbon dioxide. Water vapor is also a byproduct of the reaction if the surface contains carbon-hydrogen bonds. To study this reaction, NASA developed Earth-based facilities to produce atomic oxygen for material exposure and testing. A vacuum facility designed and built by the Electro-Physics Branch of the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field to provide atomic oxygen over a large area for studying reactions in low Earth orbit has been used to successfully clean several full-size paintings. (This facility can accommodate paintings up to 1. 5 by 2. 1 m. The atomic oxygen plasma is produced between two large parallel aluminum plates using a radiofrequency power source operating at roughly 400 W. Atomic oxygen is generated uniformly over this area at an operating pressure of 1 to 5 mtorr...|$|E
3000|$|The most {{critical}} {{consequence of the}} lack of data on the efficiency of the extraction methods of Roman <b>paint</b> <b>binders,</b> and the possible influence of microbial contamination, is the difficulty in knowing at this point whether some results are inaccurate, and to what extent, fomenting an overall uncertainty on Roman wall painting techniques. Such uncertainty can impact not only upon our knowledge of Roman art and technology, and the efficient use of resources in paint media studies, but also the conservation of the paintings, since the “knowledge of the original painting techniques [… is] essential in the implementation of appropriate conservation projects” [44 – 46]. 3 [...]...|$|R

In this article, we investigated the interaction between some commonly used fluorescent stains and protein-based <b>paint</b> <b>binders.</b> Beside fluorescence, we used for the first time circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) as a tool to reveal interactions in complex matrices relevant for the field of cultural heritage. We show that, in such cases, CPL provides unique information compared to more common techniques such as fluorescence and circular dichroism.

40|$|The tensile {{properties}} of latex paint films containing TiO 2 pigment were studied {{with respect to}} temperature, strain-rate and moisture content. The purpose of performing these experiments was to assist museums in defining safe conditions for modern paintings held in collections. The glass transition temperature of latex <b>paint</b> <b>binders</b> is {{in close proximity to}} ambient temperature, resulting in high strain-rate dependence in typical exposure environments. Time dependence of modulus and failure strain is discussed in the context of time–temperature superposition, which was used to extend the experimental time scale. Nonlinear viscoelastic material models are also presented, which incorporate a Prony series with the Ogden or Neo-Hookean hyperelastic function for different TiO 2 concentrations...|$|R
30|$|Plant resin has a {{large number}} of {{desirable}} characteristics, including water-resistance, anti-microbial and biocide properties, adhesiveness, and thermo-plasticity (i.e. its ability to become malleable when heated). It is used in Australia and Papua New Guinea for hafting heads onto shafts of composite tools, waterproofing baskets and bark buckets, caulking boats, and making and decorating ornamental items. Plant resin also burns well, has a pleasant aroma, and can be mixed with other materials, and thus is also used for illumination, incense, medicinal and narcotic purposes, and as a <b>paint</b> <b>binder</b> [10, 11]. Resin preserves relatively well and is periodically found in an archaeological context. While ethnographers have also recorded plant exudates such as polysaccharide gums, saps and latexes as useful products, resins are more likely to survive archaeologically as they are not water-soluble and are often contained by or adhered to long-lasting materials such as pottery, stone, obsidian or shell.|$|E
40|$|Effects of low Earth orbit (LEO) atomic oxygen were {{measured}} {{on a variety of}} spacecraft materials which obtained exposure on STS- 5. Material degradation dependency on temperature was found in one material. Of the five paints flown, only S 13 GLO was unaffected. Generally, the glossy paints became Lambertian and the diffuse coatings improved. Scanning electron microscope examinations indicated removal of urethane and epoxy <b>paint</b> <b>binder</b> materials. Reaction products were evident on the surfaces of Z 302 paint and Mylar. Thin films showed thickness losses ranging from negligible loss in Teflon to considerable loss in Mylar and Kapton. Glossy films such as black Kapton and white Tedlar became diffused. Kevlar 29 rope lost tensile strength and silver solar cell interconnect material oxidized. Oxidation on the backside of an elevated specimen indicated that reflections of oxygen atoms were occurring and that reflecting surfaces, probably Kapton, were not fully accommodating the incident atoms...|$|E
40|$|The thermal {{degradation}} of rabbit skin glue, a collagen-based proteinaceous material {{used as a}} <b>paint</b> <b>binder</b> in paintings, was investigated in this paper. Paint reconstructions of the glue on its own or mixed with azurite (Cu 3 (CO 3) 2 (OH) 2), calcium carbonate (CaCO 3), hematite (Fe 2 O 3 nH 2 O) and red lead (Pb 3 O 4) were analysed using a thermoanalytical approach. This method enabled us to investigate the interactions between the glue and pigments before and after artificial indoor light ageing. The study was carried out using differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetry and thermogravimetry/FTIR analysis already successfully employed to characterize the paint binders. The results highlighted that all the inorganic pigments interact with rabbit skin glue, thus decreasing the thermal stability of the binder.

30|$|The paintouts were {{prepared}} by brush coating natural parchment with different pigment/binder mixtures. Each pigment was bound with four different <b>paint</b> <b>binders,</b> chosen to simulate mediaeval and Renaissance illuminations: gum Arabic (GA), egg yolk (EY), egg white (albumen, EW) and whole egg (WE) were chosen. The pigments were also chosen to span the colour range of those {{most widely used}} in illuminations and included blue (azurite, ultramarine, indigo and smalt), yellow (lead–tin yellow I), red (vermilion, red lead, madder lake, lac lake), white (gypsum, chalk, lead white) and green (malachite, verdigris, green earth) ones. The paintouts’ thickness was not directly measured, but based on similar lab-made samples, the paint layers {{are estimated to be}} between 10 and 200 microns thick.|$|R
30|$|A {{research}} team {{with which the}} author has collaborated analysed <b>paint</b> <b>binders</b> in unrestored Roman wall paintings from Ampurias, Cartagena, and Baelo Claudia, Spain, dating from the first century BC to the second century AD [15]. In all the samples studied the paint medium was hypothesized to be emulsified beeswax. This study of paint samples randomly selected from different archaeological areas seems to point to extensive use in Roman murals of a binder made from emulsified wax. This extensive use seems to be confirmed by similar results obtained in a study {{carried out by the}} same group on unrestored Roman wall paintings from Mérida, Complutum and Marsala which will be discussed later. As in the case noted in the previous paragraph, these results are inconsistent with those found in the literature, as the presence of emulsified wax has not been reported in other studies.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study of pigment-binder systems painted on parchment, both in the form of reference samples prepared in the laboratory, and of medieval and Renaissance illuminated manuscripts, by means of contactless Fourier-transform mid-infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The research is aimed at validating external reflection FTIR (ER-FTIR) as a non-invasive method for the identification of <b>paint</b> <b>binders</b> in works of art on parchment. Based on a systematic FTIR investigation undertaken both in attenuated total reflection (ATR) and ER mode, we discuss the possibility to effectively discriminate between different binders, {{and the way in which}} the presence of a number of pigments can modify the spectral features of the pigment-binder system. The study reveals that gum Arabic can usually be discriminated from egg-based binders such as egg yolk and egg white, both in paintouts and in real artworks. Amongst all the pigments investigated, carbonates such as azurite and lead white are those that most significantly hinder the correct identification of the paint medium.|$|R
40|$|The "Terracotta Army" is a {{worldwide}} known archaeological finding in China. It {{is a part}} of the burial complex of the emperor Qin Shihuangdi (259 - 210 BC), which is still under excavation and study. The fact that the sculptures, chariots and weapons of the First Chinese Emperor's Terracotta Army were originally all painted in bright colours is still not widely known. The chemical characterisation of the paint medium was performed through an analytical procedure based on GC-MS. The proteinaceous binder was identified for the first time through a desalting procedure used in proteomics. The identification of egg as a <b>paint</b> <b>binder</b> is extremely interesting in terms of the historical significance of the work of art itself and important in terms of the method of conservation. Moreover it represents one of the first steps towards an understanding of the painting technique used on ancient sculptures in China, of which - despite their fame - nothing is yet known.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{insecticide}} dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) {{is widely}} used in indoor residual spraying (IRS) for malaria control owing to its longer residual efficacy in the field compared to other World Health Organization (WHO) alternatives. Suitable stabilization to render these alternative insecticides longer lasting could provide a less controversial and more acceptable and effective alternative insecticide formulations than DDT. Methods This study sought to investigate the reasons behind the often reported longer lasting behaviour of DDT by exposing all the WHO approved insecticides to high temperature, high humidity and ultra-violet light. Interactions between the insecticides and some mineral powders {{in the presence of}} an aqueous medium were also tested. Simple insecticidal paints were made using slurries of these mineral powders whilst some insecticides were dispersed into a conventional acrylic <b>paint</b> <b>binder.</b> These formulations were then spray painted on neat and manure coated mud plaques, representative of the material typically used in rural mud houses, at twice the upper limit of the WHO recommended dosage range. DDT was applied directly onto mud plaques at four times the WHO recommended concentration and on manure plaques at twice WHO recommended concentration. All plaques were subjected to accelerated ageing conditions of 40 °C and a relative humidity of 90 %. Results The pyrethroids insecticides outperformed the carbamates and DDT in the accelerated ageing tests. Thus UV exposure, high temperature oxidation and high humidity per se were ruled out as the main causes of failure of the alternative insecticides. Gas chromatography (GC) spectrograms showed that phosphogypsum stabilised the insecticides the most against alkaline degradation (i. e., hydrolysis). Bioassay testing showed that the period of efficacy of some of these formulations was comparable to that of DDT when sprayed on mud surfaces or cattle manure coated surfaces. Conclusions Bioassay experiments indicated that incorporating insecticides into a conventional <b>paint</b> <b>binder</b> or adsorbing them onto phosphogypsum can provide for extended effective life spans that compare favourably with DDT's performance under accelerated ageing conditions. Best results were obtained with propoxur in standard acrylic emulsion paint. Similarly, insecticides adsorbed on phosphogypsum and sprayed on cattle manure coated surfaces provided superior lifespans compared with DDT sprayed directly on a similar surface. </p...|$|E
30|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{of the use}} of animal glue in the preparatory layers and gum arabic in mixture {{with a small amount of}} another protein material to bind the paint layer is supported by the results of an investigation carried out on two Egyptian cartonnages, dated to the first century CE, in the Petrie Museum Collection [19]. Both cartonnages have a fine ground layer of pure calcite. ELISA (Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay) analysis of the fine calcite layer from one of the cartonnages indicated the presence of animal glue, while the analysis of the paint layer gave a weak response for animal glue, a weak response for plant gum (possibly acacia gum) and a stronger response for egg white. This indicates that animal glue was used for the preparatory layer, while egg and plant gum were used as binders of the paint layer, which consisted of green earth [68]. Acacia gum mixed with a little protein material was also identified as <b>paint</b> <b>binder</b> in a cartonnage from a broad collar that has been radio-carbon dated to 512 - 351 BCE [11].|$|E
40|$|A simple protocol, {{based on}} Bligh–Dyer (BD) {{extraction}} followed by MALDI-TOF-MS analysis, for fast identification of <b>paint</b> <b>binders</b> in single microsamples is proposed. For {{the first time}} it is demonstrated that the BD method is effective for the simultaneous extraction of lipids and proteins from complex, and atypical matrices, such as pigmented paint layers. The protocol makes use of an alternative denaturing anionic detergent (RapiGestTM) in order to improve efficiency of protein digestion and purification step. Detection of various lipid classes, such as triacylglycerols (TAGs) and phospholipids (PLs), and their oxidation by-products was accomplished, whereas proteins could be identified by peptide mass fingerprinting. The effect of pigments on ageing of lipids and proteins was also investigated. Finally, the proposed protocol was successfully applied to the study of a late- 15 th century Italian panel painting allowing the identification of various proteinaceous and lipid sections in organic binders, such as egg yolk, egg white, animal glue, casein, and drying oil. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the degradation of lipidic <b>paint</b> <b>binders</b> induced by irradiation with UV light (365 nm), exposure to urban air pollutants such as NOx and SO 2 and combinations of the various treatments. The characterisation of lipidic binders has been performed by a GC-MS procedure on a series of non-pigmented paint specimens prepared at the Opificio delle Pietre Dure-Firenze (Italy) and submitted to accelerated ageing. The results show that UV irradiation and exposure to NOx and SO 2 increased the polymerisation and cross-linking of the paint thus facilitating the cleavage of fatty acid chains as a result of progressed oxidation up to the formation of oxalic acid. The presence of oxalic, malonic, succinic, glutaric, adipic, pimelic, OH-octadecenoic acids and cholestenes describes the behaviour of aged paint layers. In samples of paintings by Cimabue, Raffaello and Boucher, oxalic acid and oxidised carboxylic acids have been found, confirming the results obtained in the paint specimens...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we {{characterized}} paint reconstructions using ovalbumin and casein as binders, and cinnabar (HgS) as a pigment, {{before and}} after artificial ageing. Egg and casein are common <b>paint</b> <b>binders</b> that were used historically in the technique of tempera painting. Despite extensive research on the identification of proteinaceous binders in paintings, {{there is a substantial}} lack of knowledge regarding the ageing pathway of their protein content, and their chemical interaction with inorganic pigments. Thermogravimetric analysis, infrared spectroscopy and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) were used to reveal the physico-chemical processes involved in the ageing of proteins in paintings. Taken together, the three techniques highlighted that proteins are subject to both cross-linking and hydrolysis upon ageing, and to a lesser extent, to oxidation of the side chains. Mercury-protein interactions were also revealed using a cold vapour generation atomic fluorescence spectrometer mercury-specific detector coupled to SEC. The study clearly showed that HgS forms stable complexes with proteins and acts as a sensitizer in cross-linking, hydrolysis and oxidation. RI Bramanti, Emilia/E- 1114 - 201...|$|R
