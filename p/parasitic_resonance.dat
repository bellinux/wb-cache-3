The response of the beam is sensed using both capacitive and piezoresistive transduction principles. The resonator consists of six parallel beams linked to a central anchor {{and a pair of}} symmetrical parallel beams that force the beams to vibrate in-phase. The mode suppression in the resonator is compared with other structures by finite element analysis (FEA). The relative distribution of strain energies in both the resonant structure and anchors and in both primary and secondary directions of vibration are proposed as figures of merit to compare this device to previously reported longitudinal mode beam resonators.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to design an active power factor {{correction}} (PFC) circuit for correcting a power factor of a switching power supplies. Various possible causes of bad AC mains power factor are discussed. Differences between linear and non-linear loads’ behaviour to AC mains are recognized and discussed. Various passive and active solutions for correcting current displacement and harmonic distortion are reviewed. Boost converter with quasi-resonant switching controlled by Texas Instruments’ UC 3855 is chosen for highest total power factor for given power level against other topologies and its high efficiency and lower EMI against traditional boost converter. Various circuit parameters are simulated using PSpice. Complete circuit diagram for an 1 kW output power level and worldwide mains voltage compatiblity is designed. After the device prototype was constructed, efficiency measurements were made and measured values are less than expected. This was apparently caused mainly due to absence of saturable reactor and implementation of resistive damping of the quasiresonant circuit’s <b>parasitic</b> <b>resonance.</b> Measured values of power factor are, however, very high and do meet the design expectations...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{selection}} of the preload bolt is often an afterthought {{in the design of}} Langevin type “sandwich” transducers, but quite often it is the root cause of failure for power ultrasonic applications. The main role of the preload bolt is to provide a “prestress” in the piezo stack to prevent interface “gapping” or tension in glued joints which can result in delamination. But {{as an integral part of}} a highly tuned dynamic system, the resulting <b>parasitic</b> <b>resonances</b> in these preload bolts, such as bending or longitudinal modes, are often difficult to predict and control. This research investigates many aspects of preload bolt design for achieving optimal transducer performance, including basic size and strength determination based on drive amplitude, as well as ensuring adequate thread engagement to the mating horn. Other aspects such as rule-of-thumb configuration and length guidelines to reduce <b>parasitic</b> <b>resonances</b> are also investigated. Optimizing the uniformity of stress in the piezoceramics is also considered, which is affected by end mass length, counterbores and proximity to threading. The {{selection of}} the bolt material based on stiffness is also investigated as related to electromechanical coupling. The investigation focuses solely on Langevin type transducers used for semiconductor wire bonding, and which are comprised of the common Navy Types I and III (PZT 4 and PZT 8) piezoelectric materials. Several metrics are investigated such as impedance, displacement gain, and electromechanical coupling factor.

In the proposed converter, resonant inductor is replaced with Linear Variable Inductor (LVI) that {{is controlled by}} output current. The soft switching operation range is increased and the dependency of ZVS operation on the load current is decreased. The required energy for ZVS operation at low current levels is obtained {{by means of the}} high value of the LVI. The value of LVI decreases approximately linearly with increasing current.

Generally, {{they are designed to}} have diode-like characteristics to shunt potentially harmful static charge away from thin gate-oxide insulators. These nonlinear junctions may also rectify radio-frequency signals coupled onto CMOS data lines from incidental or malicious sources of interference. The rectification process generates down-converted voltages that may cause spurious response in the CMOS such as logic errors, persistent latching (upset), or undesirable shifts in logic levels.

A flat-top cavity with a length of 700 mm and an outer diameter of 170 mm is capacitively coupled to a main resonator. A maximum peak harmonic voltage of 5 kV can be produced on a dee electrode by feeding power from a 10 kW transistor amplifier. A wide range of harmonic frequencies from 50 to 80 MHz is covered by the flat-top system. Three kinds of harmonic modes, fifth, seventh and ninth harmonics, are available to produce a flat-top voltage waveform in the whole fundamental frequency range between 6 and 18 MHz.

The neutrons will be generated by bombarding a tungsten target with protons accelerated to 96 % {{the speed of}} light by electromagnetic fields confined in 155 radio-frequency cavities along the world's most powerful linear accelerator. This thesis has been motivated by the strict control specifications on the amplitudes and phases of the accelerating electromagnetic fields. By considering the field control problem from an automatic control perspective, the thesis aims at improving the understanding of the problem and to explain important aspects of the control design. Throughout the thesis it has been helpful to model the cavity and RF system by complex-coefficient single-input single-output systems. The complex-coefficient representation was particularly useful for discussing: (1) the control design for cavities with <b>parasitic</b> <b>resonance</b> modes; (2) the effect of loop phase variations on feedback stability; (3) the directionality of the disturbances and the objective function. The thesis presents a non-standard parametrization and derivation of the cavity field dynamics that make it easier to relate the physical cavity process to the model, and simplifies the understanding of how the cavity parameters affect the achievable control performance. The control performance of simple PI(D) -controllers and general linear time-invariant controller was compared using the Youla parametrization and convex optimization; it was found that PI(D) -controllers in many cases achieved performance similar to the more general linear time-invariant controller; this indicates that simple PI(D) -controllers in many cases are an excellent choice for cavity field control.

Two 5 GHz 500 kW BeO pill-box type window prototypes have been manufactured in 2012 by the PMB Company, in close collaboration with CEA/IRFM. Both windows have been validated at low power, showing good agreement between measured and modeling, with a return loss better than 32 dB and an insertion loss below 0. 05 dB. This paper reports on the window RF design and the low power measurements. The high power tests up to 500 kW have been carried out in March 2013 in collaboration with NFRI. Results of these tests are also reported. In the current ITER LHCD design, 20 MW Continuous Wave (CW) of Radio-Frequency power at 5 GHz are expected to be generated and transmitted to the plasma. In order to separate the vacuum vessel pressure from the cryostat waveguide pressure, forty eight 5 GHz 500 kW CW windows are to be assembled on the waveguides at the equatorial port flange. For nuclear safety reasons, forty eight additional windows could be located in the cryostat section, to separate and monitor the cryostat waveguide pressure from the exterior transmission line pressure. These windows are identified as being one of the main critical components for the ITER LHCD system since first ITER LHCD studies [1] [2] [3] or more recently [4] [5], and clearly require an important R&D effort.

The section 2 of this paper reports the RF and mechanical design of a 5 GHz window. Some features of the mechanical design and the experimental RF measurements at low power are reported in section 3. High power results, made in collaboration with NFRI, are detailed in section 4. The development of CW windows is discussed in the conclusion. 2 -RF AND MECHANICAL DESIGN The proposed 5 GHz RF window is based on a pill-box design [2], i. e. a ceramic brazed in portion of a circular waveguide, connected on either side to a rectangular waveguide section.

This paper reports on the window RF design and the low power measurements. The high power tests up to 500 kW have been carried out in March 2013 in collaboration with NFRI. Results of these tests are also reported. In the current ITER LHCD design, 20 MW Continuous Wave (CW) of Radio-Frequency power at 5 GHz are expected to be generated and transmitted to the plasma. In order to separate the vacuum vessel pressure from the cryostat waveguide pressure, forty eight 5 GHz 500 kW CW windows are to be assembled on the waveguides at the equatorial port flange. For nuclear safety reasons, forty eight additional windows could be located in the cryostat section, to separate and monitor the cryostat waveguide pressure from the exterior transmission line pressure. These windows are identified as being one of the main critical components for the ITER LHCD system since first ITER LHCD studies [1] [2] [3] or more recently [4] [5], and clearly require an important R&D effort. In this context and even if the LHCD system {{is not part of the}} construction baseline, the CEA/IRFM {{is conducting}} a R&D effort in order to validate a design and the performances of these RF windows. In order to begin the assessment of this need, two 5 GHz 500 kW/ 5 s pill-box type windows prototypes have been manufactured in 2012 by the PMB Company in close collaboration with the CEA/IRFM [6]. The section 2 of this paper reports the RF and mechanical design of a 5 GHz window. Some features of the mechanical design and the experimental RF measurements at low power are reported in section 3. High power results, made in collaboration with NFRI, are detailed in section 4. The development of CW windows is discussed in the conclusion. 2 -RF AND MECHANICAL DESIGN The proposed 5 GHz RF window is based on a pill-box design [2], i. e. a ceramic brazed in portion of a circular waveguide, connected on either side to a rectangular waveguide section. Typical design rules of thumb of such device are circular section diameter about the same size of the diagonal of the rectangular waveguide (cf. FIGURE 1). Without taking into account the ceramic, the circular section length is approximately half a guided wavelength of the circular TE 11 mode, in order for the device to act as a half-wave transformer. Once optimized, taking into account the ceramic, matching is correct only for a narrow band of frequency and is very sensitive to the device dimensions and the ceramic relative permittivity. The heat losses in the ceramic, which have to be extracted by an active water cooling, depends on the inside electric field topology and of ceramic dielectric loss (loss tangent). Undesirable modes due to <b>parasitic</b> <b>resonances</b> can be excited in the ceramic volume, raising the electric field an...|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} of circuit quantum electrodynamics (c-QED), the {{coherent}} interaction of two-level systems (TLSs) with photons, confined in a superconducting microwave resonator, opens up new possibilities for quantum computing experiments. This thesis contributes {{to the expansion of}} c-QED tool-box with slow propagation line-based solutions for ubiquitous techniques, such as cryogenic Near Field Scanning Microwave Microscopy (NSMM), Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) spectroscopy and Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifier (TWPA). For NSMM, novel compact superconducting fractal resonators have been developed to be directly integrated on a scanning probe. We report NSMM operation based on a microwave high-Q resonator populated with less than 10 ^ 3 photons and demonstrate a capacitive sensitivity of 0. 38 aF/rtHz. The unique properties and the design flexibility of fractal resonators also boost their resiliency to strong magnetic fields for ESR studies. The reported high Q-factors above 10 ^ 5 in a magnetic field up to 0. 4 T translate into ESR sensitivity of 5 10 ^ 5 spins/rtHz. Furthermore, we demonstrate the operation of a practical TWPA based on a slow propagation fractal line. We achieve per unit length gain of > 0. 5 dB/cm and total gain of ~ 6 dB for a 10 cm long line. Due to a radically shortened line, the amplifier is less vulnerable to fabrication defects. Moreover, due to a successful impedance matching between the amplifier line and in/out terminals, the obtained gain vs frequency characteristic has only moderate ripples. To mitigate a common TWPA problem of coupling to <b>parasitic</b> ground plane <b>resonances,</b> we deploy a novel multilayer fabrication technology, which combines high and low kinetic inductance (KI) elements. Finally, we present an alternative implementation of a slow propagation line: a microstrip line with a thin film Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) Al 2 O 3 oxide. The resonator, based on a segment of a microstrip line, has a Q-factor on the order of 10 ^ 4 at single photon powers, reaching up to 10 ^ 5 at higher powers. As an additional functionality, we incorporate dc current control over KI so that the resonance frequency is tuned by 62 MHz range, which corresponds to a KI-related nonlinearity of 3 %...|$|R
