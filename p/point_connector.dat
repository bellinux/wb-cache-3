40|$|In this study, {{a unified}} design {{approach}} is assessed and {{proposed for the}} shear buckling verification of structural glass walls supported by non-ideal restraints. Based on the current trends of practice in buildings, the effect of (i) adhesive joints, (ii) metal frames with interposed adhesive joints or (iii) <b>point</b> mechanical <b>connectors</b> on the actual shear buckling behavior of the examined glass shear walls is properly investigated. The theoretical buckling resistance of the selected panels is first assessed by means of Finite-Element (FE) simulations, {{in the form of}} fundamental buckling shapes and Euler’s critical loads. Analytical fitting curves of general applicability are proposed, so that the classical formulations derived from shear buckling theories could be used for a rational estimation of the Euler’s critical loads, based on the restraints geometrical and mechanical features. As shown, the examined restraints have a fundamental role in the so predicted values and the assumption of ideal restraint configurations would unavoidably lead to unsafe, marked overestimations. Subsequently, the actual shear buckling resistance is also assessed, e. g., by taking into account the effects of possible initial geometrical imperfections, damage in glass or failure mechanisms in the restraints. Due to the implementation of accurate but computationally efficient FE models able to reproduce the desired mechanical effect of restraints, as well as any possible local damage in them, a rather close agreement is found with a standardized design buckling approach already in use for ideally simply supported glass shear walls only...|$|R
50|$|In {{mathematics}} and computer vision, the ridges (or the ridge set) of a smooth function of two variables are {{a set of}} curves whose points are, {{in one or more}} ways to be made precise below, local maxima of the function in at least one dimension. This notion captures the intuition of geographical ridges. For a function of N variables, its ridges are a set of curves whose points are local maxima in N − 1 dimensions. In this respect, the notion of ridge points extends the concept of a local maximum. Correspondingly, the notion of valleys for a function can be defined by replacing the condition of a local maximum with the condition of a local minimum. The union of ridge sets and valley sets, together with a related set of <b>points</b> called the <b>connector</b> set form a connected set of curves that partition, intersect, or meet at the critical points of the function.

In this research paper, the shear buckling response of glass shear walls is assessed by means of Finite-Element (FE) simulations and analytical methods. The role of (i) linear adhesive joints, (ii) metal frames with interposed adhesive joints or (iii) <b>point</b> mechanical <b>connectors</b> on the theoretical buckling resistance of these panels is first assessed (e. g. in the form of fundamental buckling shapes and Euler’s critical loads).

To check this methodology, it was analyzed the feasibility of upgrading a 400 kVRMS substation connector to operate at 765 kVRMS. However, both experimental and simulation results conducted according to the ANSI/NEMA CC 1 - 2009 standard concluded that although it passed the visual corona test, to ensure a wide safety margin it was desirable an improvement of the electrical behavior of such connector.

40|$|For self-reconfiguring modular robots the {{function}} to autonomously form and break connections between neighboring modules is a defining trait. Connectors must be strong, reversible, transmit power and signal, consume little power, {{and should be}} small and light enough for several to fit into each robot module. To make the modular robot system as versatile as possible, the connector should also be genderless, rotation agnostic, and tolerant to misalignment and positioning errors. Traditionally, connectors add significant mechanical complexity to each module. This thesis introduces two hardware components that implement {{different aspects of the}} modular robot connection process in small lightweight packages that contain no moving parts: The thermorheological valve is a device for directing fluid flow in order to selectively attract robot modules in a stochastic fluidic self-assembly system. Suitable thermorheological fluids are identified, the mechanical and thermal design of the valve is optimized, and demonstrations of mesoscale thermorheological valves are presented. The soldering connector is a connection mechanism for modular self-reconfiguring robots that forms solder joints by heating a low melting <b>point</b> alloy. The <b>connector</b> is mechanically strong, reversible, electrically conductive, only requires power when connecting and disconnecting, and supports ten to hundreds of connection cycles. Compared to other connection methods for modular robots the soldering connector, which is contained on a single printed circuit board, is very low in complexity, weight, size, and cost. Several designs of the connector are presented and evaluated and general guide- lines for application specific connector designs are provided. The thermorheological valve and soldering connector are then applied in the design of two modular robotic systems. The first proposed application is a fluidic self-assembly system of one-inch-sized, cube shaped modules that rely on stochastic external actuation to form predefined target shapes. Module prototypes and proof-of-concept experiments for this system are presented. A second application implements a system of 40 cube shaped modules that uses the self-soldering connector for self-reconfiguration.

40|$|The {{business}} {{markets of}} today are continuously becoming more globalized making {{the quality of}} delivered products and services more important for companies to achieve customer satisfaction and long-term business growth. One essential part of quality work {{is to reduce the}} costs of poor quality which is partially represented by yield loss. The purpose of this thesis was to investigate why yield loss occurs in manufacturing of radio base stations at Nanjing Communications and how it can be reduced. The work of the thesis was limited to one product group and carried out as an improvement project in accordance to the five phases of Six Sigma’s DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control). Yield loss of radio base stations at Nanjing Communications is measured {{at the end of the}} assembly process where 100 percent of the radio base stations are connected to automatic testing equipment and run through a series of automatic tests. A radio base station that fails to pass the first series of tests is considered a failed product and thereby contributes to yield loss. In the define phase the average yield loss for the past ten weeks was calculated as 83 percent and compared to the target level of 90 percent. A high-level understanding of the assembly and testing process was also created through a SIPOC map. The measure phase established a more detailed understanding of assembly and testing by creation of process flow charts for the whole process. A more detailed understanding of the test procedure was also developed by mapping the different connection interfaces between the radio base station and the test station. This description also made it clear that the test can be divided into test groups consisting of test points which in turn consist of individual test cases constituting measurement values and limits. The flow of information around the test process was also mapped to provide knowledge of where necessary data could be found and collected. The analyze phase started with a breakdown of yield loss where measurement values categorized as outliers were found to represent a large portion of yield loss. Looking into the outliers-category, radio base stations with no fault code given (products that have failed the first test and passed a retest without any action) was identified as interesting. Through brainstorming and an affinity diagram workshop, about causes to outliers with no fault code given, connection issues and different measurement values were highlighted for analysis. Further construction and analysis of Pareto charts showed that some interface connections and measurement values were more frequently involved in outliers with no fault code given. By looking into test points for relevant interface connections and combining these with measurement values the test point External Alarm Check was found relevant for root-cause analysis. An initial time series analysis of the occurrence of External Alarm Check did not lead to any clear root-causes. Through further investigation of the problem together with a test engineer in the production it was identified that the test point failure was caused by improper connection of two cables used during the test. Further analysis of what could cause this improper connection indicated problems with missing connection checks, routing of cables, fixing of test equipment, connector design, and maintenance routines. The analysis of this test point also highlighted problems related to unclear working routines and insufficient documentation of actions for products that pass a retest. Based on the findings the improve phase focused on developing improvement suggestions to minimize the impact from identified issues. Nanjing Communications were recommended to stabilize and align the test station environment, use connection checks for all test <b>points,</b> develop robust <b>connectors,</b> evaluate maintenance routines, standardize retest procedures, and ensure documentation of actions. At last the control phase emphasized the importance of communication between different production sites in relation to suggested improvements as well as ensuring that implemented improvements are standardized and documented for future work.
