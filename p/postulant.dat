5|$|In 1851, the House of Commons was petitioned by Craven Berkeley, who had {{previously}} sat as the member of parliament for Cheltenham. He claimed that his step-daughter, Augusta Talbot, {{had been forced to}} join the Franciscan Convent in Taunton as a <b>postulant</b> (the first stage to become a nun), rather than a pupil. Her father had died in 1839 and then her mother, after remarrying, died in 1841, and with the subsequent death of her brother, she was due to inherit £80,000. After the death of her mother, Talbot had been placed in the care of Francis Talbot, 5th Earl of Shrewsbury, her father's half-brother. Berkeley alleged that the Shrewsburys first attempted to marry her to François VII de La Rochefoucauld, and then when she refused, placed her at the Taunton convent against her will. The allegation followed that when Talbot became a nun, her inheritance, which was due to her in June 1852, would become property of the convent, or the greater Catholic church. Berkeley also protested that he and his daughter were not allowed to communicate with Talbot, though Thomas Wilde, 1st Baron Truro, the Lord Chancellor, noted that Berkeley had not tried to see Talbot for nine years. Lord Truro contacted Talbot, who stated that she was not a <b>postulant,</b> and she was amenable to his plans to remove her from the convent and place her in the care of a new guardian in London. He duly did so, and rejected Berkeley's petition, upon the basis of his previous lack of contact with Talbot.|$|E

50|$|All {{sisters were}} given a prayer rope upon {{entering}} the community with the obligation to recite the Jesus Prayer 100 times daily. <b>Postulants</b> did not wear the prayer rope externally, but those tonsured wore the prayer rope they received a second time at their tonsure on their left hand. <b>Postulants</b> wore a long white kerchief on their heads, which covered their foreheads completely. On Sundays and feast days the sisters wore white robes. The <b>postulants</b> wore gray robes.|$|R

Williamson entered the International Seminary of Saint Pius X at Écône, Switzerland, and in 1976 he was ordained a priest by Lefebvre.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} fourteen, Lúcia {{was sent}} to the school of the Sisters of Saint Dorothy in Vilar, near Porto. In 1928, she became a <b>postulant</b> at the Dorothean convent in Tui, just across the border in Spain. Lúcia {{continued}} to report private visions periodically throughout her life. In the mid-1930s the Bishop of Leiria encouraged Lúcia (now Sister María Lúcia das Dores) to write her memoirs, in the event that she might disclose further details of the 1917 apparitions.|$|E
25|$|Labre {{set off for}} La Trappe Abbey {{to apply}} to the Order, but did not come up to their requirements. He was under age, he was too delicate; he had no special recommendations. He later {{attempted}} to join the Carthusians and Cistercians, but each order rejected him as unsuitable for communal life. He was, for about six weeks, a <b>postulant</b> with the Carthusians at Neuville. In November 1769 he obtained admission to the Cistercian Abbey of Sept-Fonts. After a short stay at Sept-Fonts his health gave way, and it was decided that his vocation lay elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|In 1969, {{at the age}} of 50, he made a life-changing {{decision}} and entered the Community of the Resurrection. It had been thought that one day he would be made a bishop, but his earlier breakdown and now his entering religious life, ended any possibility of entering the episcopate. After more than two years as a <b>postulant,</b> he took his religious vows and officially became a monk on 1 January 1972. Having been the Dean of Trinity College when Prince Charles studied there, he was invited to the wedding of Charles and Diana in 1981. Williams composed and read one of the prayers used in the service.|$|E
25|$|From her childhood, Thérèse {{had dreamed}} of the desert to which God would some day lead her. Now she had entered that desert. Though she was now reunited with Marie and Pauline, {{from the first day}} she began her {{struggle}} to win and keep her distance from her sisters. Right at the start Marie de Gonzague, the prioress, had turned the <b>postulant</b> Thérèse over to her eldest sister Marie, who was to teach her to follow the Divine Office. Later she appointed Thérèse assistant to Pauline in the refectory. And when her cousin Marie Guerin also entered, she employed the two together in the sacristy.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} fourteen, Lúcia {{was sent}} to the school of the Sisters of St. Dorothy (Dorothean) in Vilar, a suburb of Porto, Portugal. In 1928 she became a <b>postulant</b> at the convent of the Sisters of St. Dorothy in Tui, Spain, near the border with Portugal. Lúcia {{continued}} to report private visions periodically throughout her life. She reported seeing the Virgin Mary again in 1925 in the convent. This time she said she was asked to convey the message of the First Saturdays Devotion. She said that a subsequent vision of Christ as a child reiterated this request. In 1929, Lúcia reported that Mary returned and repeated her request for the Consecration of Russia to her Immaculate Heart. She also reported an apparition in Rianxo, Galicia, in 1931, in which she said that Jesus visited her, taught her two prayers, and delivered a message to give to the church's hierarchy.|$|E

Mother Mary Cecilia of Jesus then heard a woman's voice telling her to kiss the <b>postulant's</b> eyes so that the latter will recover her sight. In the presence of Bishop Obviar, the Prioress lifted Castillo's veil and kissed the <b>postulant's</b> eyes. Immediately, the girl recovered her sight, and Bishop Obviar no longer doubted the apparitions.|$|R
25|$|She chose {{a spiritual}} director, a Jesuit, Father Pichon. At their first meeting, 28 May 1888, {{she made a}} general {{confession}} going back over all her past sins. She came away from it profoundly relieved. The priest who had himself suffered from scruples, understood her and reassured her. A few months later, he left for Canada, and Thérèse would {{only be able to}} ask his advice by letter and his replies were rare. (On 4 July 1897, she confided to Pauline, 'Father Pichon treated me too much like a child; nonetheless he did me a lot of good too by saying that I never committed a mortal sin.') During her time as a <b>postulant,</b> Thérèse had to endure some bullying from other sisters because of her lack of aptitude for handicrafts and manual work. Sister St Vincent de Paul, the finest embroiderer in the community made her feel awkward and even called her 'the big nanny goat'. Thérèse was in fact the tallest in the family, 1.62 metres (approx. 5'3"). Pauline, the shortest, was no more than 1.54m tall (approx.5').|$|E
500|$|Between 1874 and 1878 restorer Salvador Martinez Cubells was {{tasked with}} {{retouching}} the goat's horns {{and a number}} of the witches' faces. He removed more than [...] of landscape and sky {{to the right of the}} <b>postulant</b> witch, where the paint had been badly damaged. This alteration significantly shifted the work's centre of balance; the young woman was no longer near the middle of the composition, thus reducing both her prominence and the possibility that she is seen to be the focus of the work.|$|E
500|$|An {{old woman}} sits {{to the right}} of the goat; her back to the viewer. Her face is half hidden, and she wears a white-hooded headdress {{resembling}} a nun's habit. She sits alongside bottles and vials on the ground to her right. Art critic Robert Hughes wonders if they [...] "contain the drugs and philtres needed for the devilish ceremonies". The eyes of some figures are lined with white paint. The faces of the two main figures– the goat and the woman to the far right– are hidden. The woman is separated from the group, she is perhaps a <b>postulant</b> about to be initiated into the coven. She may represent Goya's maid and probable lover Leocadia Weiss, whose full-length portrait appears in the same series.|$|E

500|$|Discretionary trusts are trusts {{which require}} that the {{trustees}} exercise their powers, {{in the same way}} as a fixed trust, but allow some discretion in how to do so, in a similar manner to mere powers. Since trustees hold the discretionary power to choose how to act under an established boundary set out by the settlor of a trust, evidential certainty is not relevant and does not affect discretionary trusts anyway. The leading test of certainty of objects here is also the [...] "any given <b>postulant</b> test", applied to discretionary trusts in McPhail v Doulton. The courts attempted to mitigate this test in Re Baden’s Deed Trusts (no 2); however, all three judges of the Court of Appeal gave separate reasons. Stamp LJ had an approach based entirely on the facts, with no greater impact on certainty of objects. Sachs LJ took the approach that the burden of proof was on the claimants to prove they were beneficiaries, not on the trustees to prove the trust was valid. Megaw LJ, however, took the approach that a trust could be valid, even with uncertain beneficiaries, if there was a [...] "core number" [...] of beneficiaries who were certain. Megaw LJ's stand reflects the current position. Otherwise, trusts would have been failed if there is one individual who cannot be said to be the [...] "given postulant".|$|E
2500|$|Members of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence include {{people who}} {{identify}} {{with a variety}} of sexual orientations and genders, although the majority are gay men. [...] Joining an order mirrors the steps for joining an actual order of nuns. Potential members are encouraged to attend organizational meetings as aspirants, and told that if they are not intending to make a lifelong commitment they should seriously reconsider. After showing intent and being approved by the order, an aspirant is promoted to a <b>postulant</b> and is expected to learn {{about the history of the}} organization and continue to work behind the scenes for at least six months. Postulants are not allowed to wear nun's attire, but may instead dress in [...] "festive garb that fits in with Order", according to the Sisters' website. If the members approve of the <b>postulant,</b> a fully indoctrinated member may act as a sponsor and the <b>postulant</b> is promoted to a novice. Novices are allowed to wear white veils and whiteface make-up. This phase lasts another six months during which the novice is expected to work within the organization and plan an event. If three-fourths of the order agrees, the novice is promoted to a full member of the group.|$|E
2500|$|Thérèse's {{time as a}} <b>postulant</b> {{began with}} her welcome into the Carmel, Monday, 9 April 1888.

According to the monastery website, regarding the male monastic community, [...] "Usually, there are between 15 and 25 bhikkhus and samaneras in residence, living a contemplative, celibate, mendicant life according to the Vinaya and Dhamma. ... The community also consists of anagārikas, or white-robed <b>postulants</b> on the eight precepts, who {{after a year or}} two may be given samanera ordination." [...] The monastery's order of siladhara, or ten-precept nuns, dates from 1983; there are 10 or so members and a number of female <b>postulants</b> at Amaravati and at Chithurst Buddhist Monastery in West Sussex.|$|R

2500|$|Although {{the novice}} mistress, Sister Marie of the Angels, found Thérèse slow, the young <b>postulant</b> adapted well {{to her new}} environment. She wrote, [...] "Illusions, the Good Lord gave me the grace to have none on {{entering}} Carmel. I found religious life as I had figured, no sacrifice astonished me." [...] She sought above all {{to conform to the}} rules and customs of the Carmelites that she learnt each day with her four religious of the novitiate.|$|E
2500|$|Pascal {{fell away}} from this initial {{religious}} engagement and experienced {{a few years of}} what some biographers have called his [...] "worldly period" [...] (1648–54). [...] His father died in 1651 and left his inheritance to Pascal and Jacqueline, for whom Pascal acted as her conservator. [...] Jacqueline announced that she would soon become a <b>postulant</b> in the Jansenist convent of Port-Royal. [...] Pascal was deeply affected and very sad, not because of her choice, but because of his chronic poor health; he too needed her.|$|E
2500|$|Disliking the {{attention}} she was attracting, Bernadette {{went to the}} hospice school run by the Sisters of Charity of Nevers where {{she had learned to}} read and write. Although she considered joining the Carmelites, her health precluded her entering any of the strict contemplative orders. On 29 July 1866, with 42 other candidates, she took the religious habit of a <b>postulant</b> and joined the Sisters of Charity at their motherhouse at Nevers. Her Mistress of Novices was Sister Marie Therese Vauzou. The Mother Superior at the time gave her the name Marie-Bernarde in honor of her godmother who was named [...] "Bernarde".|$|E
