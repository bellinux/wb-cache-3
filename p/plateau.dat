40|$|Aspects of the geology of collisional <b>plateaus</b> {{formed by}} the {{thickening}} of continental crust are briefly reviewed. The history of studies of collisional <b>plateaus</b> is summarized, and igneous activity in collisional <b>plateaus</b> is discussed. Isostatic considerations pertaining to these <b>plateaus</b> are addressed, developing models of isostatic support of topography which illustrate the importance of compressional tectonics {{in the creation of}} high altitude <b>plateaus.</b> Possible analogous environments on Venus are considered. Finally, the paradox of extension associated with compression in the <b>plateaus</b> is discussed...|$|R
50|$|<b>Plateaus</b> {{can also}} be formed by the erosional {{processes}} of glaciers on mountain ranges, leaving them sitting between the mountain ranges. Water can also erode mountains and other landforms down into <b>plateaus.</b> Dissected <b>plateaus</b> are highly eroded <b>plateaus</b> cut by rivers and broken by deep narrow valleys. Computer modeling studies suggest that high <b>plateaus</b> may also be partially a result from the feedback between tectonic deformation and dry climatic conditions created at the lee side of growing orogens.|$|R

5|$|Croatian {{forces were}} {{hampered}} by an inadequate command structure, poor coordination and lack heavy weapons. The battle {{resulted in more}} than 200 combat deaths, and established lines of control which would remain unchanged until 1994, when the <b>plateau</b> was recaptured by the HVO. In 2012, Republika Srpska authorities charged seven Croats with war crimes committed at the <b>plateau</b> against civilians and prisoners of war. The next year, Croatian authorities charged 21 former JNA members with war crimes against HVO prisoners captured at the Kupres <b>Plateau.</b>|$|E
5|$|Geomorphologically, the {{mountain}} is a mesa-like outlier, {{that is to}} say, {{the remains of a}} <b>plateau</b> that has been otherwise eroded to leave only a single pillar of rock - weaker or fractured rocks (the so-called Jasneuf fault) between the current summit and the Vercors high <b>plateau</b> were eroded over time by over 400 metres, leaving the peak standing on its own. This has resulted in several unique features of Mont Aiguille, including the cliffs, which are almost identical to those on {{the eastern edge of the}} Vercors <b>Plateau</b> such as those on the edge of the Grand Veymont, which is the highest point of the range. Another feature resulting from this is the presence of meadows on the summit <b>plateau,</b> which are similar to those to the west on the rest of the Vercors <b>plateau.</b>|$|E
5|$|If the {{landings}} {{had gone}} to plan, the 11th Battalion {{was supposed to be}} crossing the <b>plateau</b> heading north. The 10th Battalion, south of the <b>plateau,</b> was to capture a Turkish trench and artillery battery behind Gun Ridge. The 9th Battalion, furthest south, was to attack the artillery battery at Gaba Tepe, and the 12th Battalion was the reserve, with 26th Jacob's Mountain Battery to establish their gun line on the <b>plateau.</b> Unknown to the ANZACs, the Turks had an artillery battery sited on 400 <b>Plateau.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{collection}} of <b>plateaus</b> constitute {{a large part}} of the plain. Among them are the Ōmiya, Musashino, Sagamino, and Jōsō <b>Plateaus.</b> These large <b>plateaus</b> are divided into smaller ones by shallow river valleys. One of the common features of the <b>plateaus</b> is that their surfaces are covered with a thick layer of loam of volcanic origin. Volcanic ashes from surrounding volcanoes, Mounts Asama, Haruna, and Akagi to the north and Mounts Hakone and Fuji to the southwest, are thought to have been deposited on these <b>plateaus.</b>|$|R

5|$|Subsequent uplift of the Colorado <b>Plateau</b> and tilting of the Markagunt <b>Plateau</b> started 13million years ago. This steepened {{the stream}} {{gradient}} of the ancestral Virgin River (Zion Canyon {{section of the}} park), and Taylor and La Verkin creeks (Kolob Canyons section of the park), causing them to flow and downcut faster into the underlying Markagunt <b>Plateau.</b> Downcutting continues to be especially rapid after heavy rainstorms and winter runoff when the water contains large amounts of suspended and abrasive sand grains. Uplift and downcutting are so fast that slot canyons (very narrow river-cut features with vertical walls), such as the Zion Narrows, formed.|$|E
5|$|The Antarctic <b>Plateau</b> was claimed for Norway by Roald Amundsen as the King Haakon VII <b>Plateau</b> {{when his}} {{expedition}} {{was the first}} to reach South Pole on 14 December 1911.

However, roughly the same area had been claimed by the British as the King Edward VII <b>Plateau,</b> which was in conflict with the Norwegian claim.

40|$|International audience: Several {{authors have}} {{discussed}} the existence of late-life fecundity <b>plateaus</b> in Drosophila melanogaster. However, all these studies have pooled flies to show such <b>plateaus.</b> Here, we have reanalyzed previously published fecundity results to know whether these <b>plateaus</b> exist at the individual level. We found that these <b>plateaus</b> are observed in ca 20 % of females and in more than 50 % if only the longer-lived flies are taken into account. We conclude that late-life fecundity <b>plateaus</b> are not a rare phenomenon when considering a whole cohort of flies and are very common in oldest flies...|$|R
5|$|The Australians on 400 <b>Plateau</b> had {{for some}} time been {{subjected}} to sniping and artillery fire and could see Turkish troops digging in on Gun Ridge. Around 13:00 a column of Turkish reinforcements from the 27th Infantry Regiment, in at least battalion strength, were observed moving along the ridge-line from the south. The Turks then turned towards 400 <b>Plateau</b> and advanced in extended order. The Turkish counter-attack soon forced the advanced Australian troops to withdraw, and their machine-gun fire caused them heavy casualties. It {{was not long before}} the attack had forced a wedge between the Australians on Baby 700 and those on 400 <b>Plateau.</b> The heavy Turkish fire onto Lone Pine forced the survivors to withdraw back to the western slope of 400 <b>Plateau.</b> At 14:25 Turkish artillery and small arms fire was so heavy that the Indian artillerymen were forced to push their guns back off the <b>plateau</b> by hand, and they reformed on the beach.|$|E

5|$|The entire Colorado <b>Plateau</b> {{then started}} to uplift from near sea level to several {{thousand}} feet (over a kilometer) in elevation.
