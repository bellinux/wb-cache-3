50|$|The early 1950s saw Dr. Bazeley at the University of Pittsburgh in the United States {{working with}} Jonas Salk {{and his team}} towards the {{production}} of a <b>Poliomyelitis</b> <b>vaccine.</b> With the success of that project, he returned to Australia to once again find himself given the task of pioneering {{the production of a}}n important new weapon against disease. Twenty-five million doses of Salk <b>Poliomyelitis</b> <b>vaccine</b> were produced at CSL in the 1950s and 1960s under Dr. Bazeley's leadership as director of the government institution. This led to widespread recognition. He was awarded a C.B.E.

40|$|The {{immunization}} {{status of}} the children of Traveller Gypsies presenting to two general practices and a paediatric accident and emergency department in east London between July 1988 and February 1990 was compared with that of a control group presenting to the same services. Study of parental reports and other records for 72 Traveller Gypsy children and 106 control children aged 10 months to six years revealed that Traveller Gypsy children had significantly lower completion rates for pertussis, measles, diphtheria/tetanus and <b>poliomyelitis</b> <b>vaccines</b> than the control group. The difference between the uptake of the first and third diphtheria/tetanus, pertussis and <b>poliomyelitis</b> <b>vaccines</b> was significantly greater among the Traveller Gypsy children than among the control group. The low immunization rates are due to poor access to services as well as rejection of certain vaccines by Traveller Gypsies. The 1990 general practitioner contract and reforms to the health service may result in decreased access for Traveller Gypsies unless steps are taken by family health services and district health authorities to meet the health care needs of this group. Possible solutions to this problem include outreach services to caravan sites, opportunistic immunization, better records and targeted health education...|$|R

The AlPO 4 method was found to be superior in precision to ultrafiltration, but the latter was more convenient for small samples. The AlPO 4 method usually gave about 10 %- 20 % lower D-antigen values than the filtration method, probably owing to incomplete elution of antigen from the precipitate...|$|R

40|$|Epidemiologic {{evidence}} for {{an association between}} vaccinations and atopy development is inconsistent. We evaluated the influence of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) combination vaccines in 6 -month-old infants on the prevalence of atopic disorders in 18 -month-old children. Methods: We used multistage, stratified systematic sampling to recruit 24, 200 mother–newborn pairs from the Taiwan national birth registration in 2005. Vaccination status was ascertained through official vaccine cards, while risk factors for atopic disorders were gathered by questionnaires at 6 months of age. Information about development of atopic dermatitis (AD) and recurrent wheezing was collected at 18 months of age. The relationship between atopic disorders and Hib combination vaccines, diphtheria–pertussis–tetanus–Hib and oral <b>poliomyelitis</b> <b>vaccines</b> (DPT-Hib&OPV) and DPT-Hib-inactivated <b>poliomyelitis</b> <b>vaccines</b> (DPT-Hib-IPV), were estimated by multiple logistic regression. Results: A total of 19, 968 children completed the follow-up and participated in the study. AD was noted in 1584 (7. 9 %) infants while recurrent wheezing was found in 1220 (6. 1 %) infants. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) (95 % CI) {{for the development of}} AD in the DPT-Hib&OPV and DPT-Hib-IPV vaccination groups were given as 1. 38 (1. 15 - 1. 65) and 1. 49 (1. 29 - 1. 72), compared to those without Hib vaccination (DTP&OPV vaccination). However, the association between DPT-Hib&OPV and DPT-Hib-IPV vaccinations and recurrent wheezing failed to reach statistical significance. Conclusion: There is a potential risk for AD after receiving Hib combination vaccines. Hib vaccination is important to the public health, and therefore the observation requires further investigations...|$|R
40|$|When {{stored at}} 4 C, or heated at 22 or 35 C {{followed}} by storage at 4 C, {{the potency of}} pertussis vaccines preserved with Merthiolate was more stable than the potency of vaccines preserved with benzethonium chloride or the parabens (methyl- and propyl-p-hydroxybenzoate). Without preservative, potency was more stable than {{in the presence of}} benzethonium chloride or the parabens, but less stable than when Merthiolate was present. The histamine-sensitizing factor of the vaccines likewise decreased with the loss of potency. The deleterious effect of benzethonium chloride and the absence of the stabilizing effect of Merthiolate were contributing factors, if not the sole cause, for the instability of pertussis vaccine in quadruple antigen vaccine (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis and <b>poliomyelitis</b> <b>vaccines)</b> ...|$|R
40|$|In {{tropical}} countries, seroconversion rates following oral poliomyelitis vaccination {{are frequently}} unsatisfactory. In {{an area of}} the Machakos district in Kenya, 4000 children under 5 years of age have been registered and are visited fortnightly by trained field staff as part of a comprehensive, population-based, longitudinal surveillance project. It was considered possible that <b>poliomyelitis</b> <b>vaccine,</b> given orally to children twice or three times at home, would produce satisfactory conversion rates. After collection of blood from a random sample of the children, vaccine was given twice to all children under 5 years of age. Blood was then collected a second time from a different sample of children. After a third dose of vaccine, a third blood collection followed. The percentages of the children that received vaccine each round were calculated and the sera tested for antibodies. It appeared that the mean titre was more strongly related to age than to the number of doses of <b>poliomyelitis</b> <b>vaccine</b> received. Improvement of herd immunity after two vaccine distributions was significant for a few age groups and for two types of vaccine only. In none of the groups was a significant improvement obtained by the third vaccine distribution.

40|$|On Feb 1, 2002, inactivated <b>poliomyelitis</b> <b>vaccines</b> {{replaced}} live-attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in New Zealand’s immunisation schedule, allowing systematic {{monitoring of}} OPV virus circulation. Findings of paediatric-inpatient surveillance indicate that 7 % of children excreted polioviruses before this switch, but none did so 1 month afterwards. Acute flaccid paralysis surveillance detected no poliovirus {{during and after}} the switch, whereas enterovirus surveillance detected poliovirus only once during the switch. Environmental surveillance identified polioviruses in sewage samples until May, 2002, after which they were detected infrequently. Intratypic differentiation and sequencing showed that all polioviruses were Sabin-like. Multiple surveillance methods hence showed that OPV strains did not persist for extended periods after a vaccine switch in a developed country with a temperate climate. Sequence homology with Sabin vaccine parent strains indicated that polioviruses detected more than 4 months after the switch were of recent origin, consistent with importation from OPV-using countries...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{study and}} compare the Japanese vaccine policy with the policy in the UK and to discuss factors that may explain the gap in vaccine {{availability}} between the two countries. MethodsWe analysed approval and immunisation programme data from Japan and the UK for 20 common vaccines, {{all of which were}} approved and available from the UK National Health Service. ResultsOf these 20 common vaccines, only four were introduced in Japan. Of the 16 unapproved vaccines, 11 were combination vaccines. Indications for the other five unapproved vaccines were the prevention of infection with meningococcus (3 vaccines) and pneumococcus (2 vaccines). Coverage of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and <b>poliomyelitis</b> <b>vaccines</b> was similar between the two countries whereas that of measles and rubella was higher in Japan. ConclusionsThese results show that there is still a large gap between Japan and the UK regarding access to 20 common vaccines and immunisation programmes. The keys to closing this gap include: (1) revision of vaccine regulations, (2) amendment of vaccine-related laws to secure funding and cooperation between professionals and public health authorities, and (3) improvement in the perception of vaccines among the general public and mass media...|$|R

40|$|Infection with {{poliovirus}} (a small, non-enveloped Picornavirus) {{can result}} in poliomyelitis, hallmarked by symptoms of paralysis which is caused by viral destruction of motor neurons.

50|$|MVD {{was first}} {{documented}} in 1967, when 31 people became ill in the German towns of Marburg and Frankfurt am Main, and in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The outbreak involved 25 primary MARV infections and seven deaths, and six nonlethal secondary cases. The outbreak was traced to infected grivets (species Chlorocebus aethiops) imported from an undisclosed location in Uganda {{and used in}} developing <b>poliomyelitis</b> <b>vaccines.</b> The monkeys were received by Behringwerke, a Marburg company founded by the first winner of the Nobel Prize in Medicine, Emil von Behring. The company, {{which at the time}} was owned by Hoechst, was originally set up to develop sera against tetanus and diphtheria. Primary infections occurred in Behringwerke laboratory staff while working with grivet tissues or tissue cultures without adequate personal protective equipment. Secondary cases involved two physicians, a nurse, a post-mortem attendant, and the wife of a veterinarian. All secondary cases had direct contact, usually involving blood, with a primary case. Both physicians became infected through accidental skin pricks when drawing blood from patients. A popular science account of this outbreak can be found in Laurie Garrett’s book The Coming Plague.|$|R

With children of foreign nationalities, the response rate was 66. 7 %, whereas the response rate of Swiss children was 90. 6 % (p < 0. 001). The response rate of children of a European nationality outside the European Union was especially poor (33. 3 %). The immunization rate with three doses of diphtheria, tetanus and <b>poliomyelitis</b> <b>vaccines</b> was 99. 4 %, and that of the pertussis vaccine was 93. 3 %.

40|$|Decision-making {{on the use}} of {{poliomyelitis}} vaccines in the WHO Expanded Immunization Programme, {{and particularly}} in the developing nations, needs to be based on an understanding of the epidemiology of poliomyelitis {{in different parts of the}} globe. Even with two safe and effective kinds of <b>poliomyelitis</b> <b>vaccine</b> available, poliomyelitis has by no means been eradicated from the world.

Killed-virus poliomyelitis vaccines have proved to be effective in certain countries that have used them exclusively; these are small countries with excellent public health systems, where coverage by the killed vaccine has been wide and frequent.

The goal of this study was to determine compliance with official standard immunization recommendations in pre-school and school-aged children in Basel, Switzerland, focusing on coverage rates and timely administration. Of a cohort of children entering kindergarten and third-grade primary school in Basel in 2001, 310 and 310, respectively, were identified in proportion to the overall age-appropriate populations in the four city districts. Foreign-born children were excluded. The data were extracted from immunization records provided voluntarily by parents. Coverage for three doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and <b>poliomyelitis</b> <b>vaccines</b> was 90 % for pertussis and Hib. The rates of age-appropriate booster doses were significantly lower, especially for pertussis and Hib (> 60 %). Cumulative coverage for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) was > 90 % for the first dose and 33 % for the second dose by 10 years of age. All immunizations were administered with significant delays. Coverage for the first three doses of DTP combination vaccines did not reach 90 % before 1 year of age and, for the first dose of MMR, a plateau just below 80 % was not reached before 3 years of age. Delayed administration of immunizations in childhood, as well as complete lack of booster doses in a significant fraction of children, with important implications for public health have been discovered in this study.
