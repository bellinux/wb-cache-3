40|$|The DSS Application is a {{computer}} program comprising a Windows version of the UNIX-based Decelerator System Simulation (DSS) coupled with an Excel front end. The DSS is an executable code that simulates the dynamics of airdropped cargo from first motion in an aircraft through landing. The bare DSS is difficult to use; the front end {{makes it easy to}} use. All inputs to the DSS, control of execution of the DSS, and postprocessing and plotting of outputs are handled in the front end. The front end is graphics-intensive. The Excel software provides the graphical elements without need for additional programming. Categories of input parameters are divided into separate tabbed windows. Pop-up comments describe each parameter. An error-checking software component evaluates combinations of parameters and alerts the user if an error results. Case files can be created from inputs, making it possible to build cases from previous ones. Simulation output is plotted in 16 charts displayed on a separate worksheet, enabling plotting of multiple DSS cases with flight-test data. Variables assigned to each plot can be changed. Selected input parameters can be edited from the <b>plot</b> <b>sheet</b> for quick sensitivity studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{power and}} {{potential}} of computer-aided design (CAD) {{is based on}} the ability to reuse and share information. This is particularly true in building design and construction, a field that involves extensive information and teamwork between a variety of consultants. CAD provides both a common medium of exchange and a tool for producing the documentation required for construction and management. The key to realizing the potential of CAD is using common organizing principles. In particular, standard organization of files and layers is essential for efficient work and communication. Virtually all CAD systems support the concept of layers. This function allows graphic information to be grouped for display or plotting purposes. Intelligent use of layers can reduce drawing time and improve drawing coordination. By turning selected layers on or off, a variety of different <b>plotted</b> <b>sheets</b> can be produced. The layer is the basic CAD tool for managing visual information. By making it possible to reuse information, layers reduce drawing time and improve coordination. Layers and the new class libraries and object data complement, rather than compete with each other. Using layers to manage the visual aspects of graphic entities, with class libraries and object data to store the non-graphic data, gives architects an efficient way to work in CAD...|$|R
5000|$|The United States Naval Academy {{announced}} that it was discontinuing its course on celestial navigation, considered to be one of its most demanding non-engineering courses, from the formal curriculum in the spring of 1998. It stated that a sextant is accurate to a three-mile (5 km) radius, while a satellite-linked computer can pinpoint a ship within 60 ft as long as the satellites are functioning correctly. Midshipmen continued to learn to use the sextant, but instead of performing a tedious 22-step mathematical calculation to plot a ship's position, midshipmen feed the raw data into a computer. The US Naval Academy continued to practice celestial navigation for members of the USNA Varsity Offshore Sailing Team (VOST) and competes in the celestial spinnaker division in the bi-annual Marion-Bermuda Race racing aboard the venerable Navy 44 sail training craft. The Naval Academy Sailing Squadron (NASS) that consists of both the Offshore Sail Training Squadron (OSTS) and VOST crews use both long forms with paper <b>plotting</b> <b>sheets</b> and electronic celestial applications. Celestial navigation certification is required to achieve the highest [...] "E" [...] qualification at NASS. In October 2015, citing concerns about the reliability of GPS systems in the face of potential hostile hacking, the USNA reinstated instruction in celestial navigation in the 2015-2016 academic year. At another federal service academy, the US Merchant Marine Academy, there was no break in instruction in celestial navigation as it is required to pass the US Coast Guard License Exam. It is also taught at Harvard, most recently as Astronomy 2.|$|R

Recently obtained bathymetric soundings from several new sources, most notably the Polar Duke site survey and the updated <b>plotting</b> <b>sheets</b> of the British and Argentine hydro-graphic offices, have substantially expanded the bathymetric data base for this still relatively underexplored region of the world's oceans (see Fig. 2). In addition, gravity anomalies de-rived from SEAS AT altimetry data (Haxby et al., 1983; Haxby and LaBrecque, 1986) have provided insight into the morphol-ogy of certain bathymetric features that are not as yet fully defined by bathymetric soundings alone (Fig. 3). It should be noted, however, {{that all of the}} features shown on the map are at least partly supported by existing bathymetric data; no features are derived from SEASAT data only. One of the difficulties in compiling a bathymetric map of this area is the advanced age of {{a large part of the}} data base. A great many of the ship tracks in the western South Atlantic are over 20 yr old and thus, predate the routine use of satellite navi-gation. As a result, navigation data from these cruises are fre-quently unreliable. In some cases, the navigation data can be corrected by judiciously correlating track crossings with higher quality navigation from more recent cruises; in places, however, we have discarded whole strings of soundings as too ambiguous for confident manipulation. During the period 1975 - 1978, the ARA Islas Orcadas (Ar-gentine Naval Hydrographic Service) carried out extensive geo-physical surveying in the South Atlantic under a joint progra...|$|R

40|$|Advisor: Ronald J. ZborayFROM HOLLYWOOD TO SHANGHAI: AMERICAN SILENT FILMS IN CHINAQian Zhang, PhDUniversity of Pittsburgh, 2009 AbstractMy {{dissertation}} re-constructs {{the history}} of Hollywood movies in 1920 s Shanghai through archival work in both China and the United States. Before that decade, film exhibition in China {{was little more than}} a novelty with limited social influence. The 1920 s saw a boom in American film production and attempts to develop foreign markets for it. Consequently, Hollywood films flooded into China, just ahead of the development of the local national film industry in the late 1920 s, and hence shaped the environment for that development. As heralds of a new medium with unprecedented capacity for shaping people's perceptions, beliefs, and viewpoints, American films were received and interpreted by Chinese audiences in a transnational context. My research is mostly based on rarely or never used primary sources both in the United States and China, mainly in archives including the U. S. official documents of the Department of State located at the National Archives, the special collection of the United Artists at the Wisconsin State Historical Society Library, indexed New York Times, and D. W. Griffith's unpublished documents such as D. W. Griffith Papers 1897 - 1954, 1927 Yearbook of Chinese Cinema, 1920 s fan magazines such as The Movie Guide, The China Film Pictorial, The Stage and Screen, The Photoplay World, Photoplay Pictorial, The Movie Magazine, and Cineograph, a collection of film <b>plot</b> <b>sheets,</b> and local popular magazines such as The Good Companion. Through my dissertation, I have found that the promotion and consumption of American films in 1920 s Shanghai did not result in a homogeneous American culture as the Chinese re-deployed, re-invented, and appropriated American films for local political, cultural, and social discourses. During that turbulent decade, Hollywood films played into the Chinese political discourse of nationalism and modernity. The modernity discourse was prominent in the Chinese filmic texts and extra-textual filmic spheres. Hollywood's impact on China can be examined by the reaction of the Chinese film industry toward American films, the changing lifestyle of Chinese locals, and their perception of American people and values...|$|R

50|$|The {{measured}} angle {{between the}} celestial {{body and the}} visible horizon {{is directly related to}} the distance between the celestial body's GP and the observer's position. After some computations, referred to as sight reduction, this measurement is used to plot a line of position (LOP) on a navigational chart or <b>plotting</b> work <b>sheet,</b> the observer's position being somewhere on that line. (The LOP is actually a short segment of a very large circle on the earth which surrounds the GP of the observed celestial body. An observer located anywhere on the circumference of this circle on the earth, measuring the angle of the same celestial body above the horizon at that instant of time, would observe that body to be at the same angle above the horizon.) Sights on two celestial bodies give two such lines on the chart, intersecting at the observer's position (actually, the two circles would result in two points of intersection arising from sights on two stars described above, but one can be discarded since it will be far from the estimated position—see the figure at example below). Most navigators will use sights of three to five stars, if they're available, since that will result in only one common intersection and minimize the chance for error. That premise is the basis for the most commonly used method of celestial navigation, and is referred to as the 'altitude-intercept method'.|$|R

40|$|An {{unconventional}} {{approach for}} obtaining a legally supportive, 2 D coordinate based cadastre is addressed. The proposed method considers natural selection or biological optimizations known as Genetic Algorithm (GA), {{which has been}} widely applied in solving complex computation problems {{in a variety of}} disciplines. This paper describes the implementation of GA in the cadastral domain employing its principle to achieve unique, accurate and homogeneous coordinates, with a standard deviation complying with Survey of Israel (SOI) requirements. The existing method of land property registration in Israel is based on a definition of a land unit (parcel), identified by a unique number within a registered block, and graphically plotted based on field measurements linked to the national coordinate system. The products of the ground measurements are recorded in field books, following which the block borderlines, parcel turning points (vertices) and additional details are <b>plotted</b> on field <b>sheets.</b> As a result, the current cadastral system is of an analog nature and deals with surface properties only. Due to an increasing number of urban centers, urban and land development projects, and the urgent need for a more accurate cadastre in the digital era, the transition to an analytica...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{investigate}} the use of low and medium temperature active solar energy systems for the disinfestation of greenhouse soils. Four flat plate solar collectors (low-temperature solar thermal energy devices) and six parabolic trough concentrators (medium-temperature solar thermal energy devices) were used to heat water, which, via a buried heat exchange system, was used to heat the soil of greenhouse plots. These treatments were compared to no solar (control) and solarized (using a 50 µm-thick transparent polyethylene <b>sheet)</b> <b>plots.</b> Experiments performed in the summers of 2004 and 2005 showed that: 1) the temperatures reached and the energy accumulated in the soil- and therefore the disinfestation capacity- were greater with either of the active solar treatments (40 - 60 ºC and 10. 222. 438 – 18. 102. 054 J, respectively) than with solarization (< 40 ºC and 6. 628. 760 J, respectively) and 2) the tem-peratures reached using the parabolic trough concentrators (50 - 60 ºC) were higher than those achieved with the flat plate solar collectors (40 - 50 ºC). The soil temperatures reached suggest these systems could be used to disinfest green-house soils. Additional key words: soil heating, soil treatment, solarization.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the design and {{construction}} of rolled-fill earth dams with the standard methods of practice, taking the Hirakud Dam as the basis. The field operations of the investigation to obtain observational information and to secure samples for the laboratory testing include observation of rain gauge and river gauge readings, taking river water samples, digging test pits, drilling grout holes, opening drifts, digging borrow pits and conducting detailed topographical surveys. Laboratory tests are conducted on the samples {{and the results are}} plotted in graphs. Rainfall and run-off statistics are plotted in graphs. Observational information of geology is <b>plotted</b> in log <b>sheets</b> and the field data of survey works is made use of for the preparation of the topographical maps. From the results of the investigation it is found that the Hirakud Dam has a firm foundation and there is sufficient quantity of material for the embankment at site. The annual rainfall is 47. 49 inches yielding a run-off of 50 million sore feet over a catchment area of 32, 200 square miles. The stability of the embankment is computed by the slip circle method and the seepage water from the flow net method. The dam is designed for 100 years with a reservoir capacity of 5. 98 million acre feet at the maximum water level elevation 625 feet, the bed level being elevation 500 feet. The dead storage is 2. 24 million acre feet corresponding to elevation 590 feet, and the maximum submerged area corresponding elevation 625 feet is 150, 380 acres. The minimum factor of safety for the upstream slope is 1. 68 and that for the downstream slope is 1. 19. The seepage water is 0. 264 cubic feet per lineal foot per year. The dam is to be constructed as per the design and the specifications. The compaction is attained by the mechanical effort at the optimum moisture content. The mechanical effort is influenced by the type of roller, its weight and the number of passes. Field control is affected by vigilant supervision, needle penetration, ring test and sand test. The construction is to be carried out according to a plan of seven stages. A comparison and contrast is drawn between the U. S. A. and India to bring out the inherent difficulties of construction operations of large dams in India. Importance is given to the sequence of the subject matter since no text book gives all the relevant portions as used in practice. Reference is given to the text books from which the formulas are taken so that a student who is interested in theory, derivation and explanation of the formulas may study the available literature. The procedures employed and the conclusions drawn are based on the experience, observation and the research study of the author both in India and the United States of America...|$|R
