2500|$|In propionic acidemia, a rare {{inherited}} genetic disorder, propionate {{acts as a}} metabolic toxin in liver cells by accumulating in mitochondria as propionyl-CoA and its derivative, methylcitrate, two {{tricarboxylic acid}} cycle inhibitors. [...] <b>Propanoate</b> is metabolized oxidatively by glia, which suggests astrocytic vulnerability in propionic acidemia when intramitochondrial propionyl-CoA may accumulate. Propionic acidemia may alter both neuronal and glial gene expression by affecting histone acetylation. [...] When propionic acid is infused directly into rodents' brains, it produces reversible behavior (e.g., hyperactivity, dystonia, social impairment, perseveration) and brain changes (e.g., innate neuroinflammation, glutathione depletion) {{that may be used}} as a means to model autism in rats.|$|E

40|$|Chiral epoxides-such as ethyl and methyl (S) - 3 -(oxiran- 2 -yl) <b>propanoates</b> ((S) - 1 a/ 1 b) -are {{valuable}} precursors in many chemical syntheses.
