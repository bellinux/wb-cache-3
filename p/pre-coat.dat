This not only traps fine particulates but also provides protection for the bag itself from moisture, and oily or sticky particulates which can bind the filter media.

The present work introduced the albumin <b>pre-coating</b> strategy that effectively prevented inorganic layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles with different sizes and interlayer anions from aggregation in phosphate buffer saline and cell culture medium solutions. We found that the key factors influencing the colloidal stability of albumin-coated LDHs included (1) the sequence and speed of reagent addition during the <b>pre-coating</b> process, (2) the albumin/LDH mass ratio, (3) the LDH particle size, and (4) anions intercalated in the LDH.

40|$|Antibodies {{to nuclear}} antigens (antinuclear {{antibodies}} or ANAs) are the serological hallmark of {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE). These antibodies bind diverse nuclear antigens that include DNA, histones and non-histone proteins as well as complexes of proteins with DNA and RNA. Because of the frequency of ANA expression in SLE, testing {{is an important component}} of clinical evaluation as well as determination of eligibility for clinical trials or utilization of certain therapies. Immunofluorescence assays have been commonly used for this purpose although this approach can be limited by issues of throughput, variability and difficulty in determining positivity. ELISA and multiplex assays are also useful approaches although these assays may give an incomplete picture of antibodies present. To develop a sensitive and quantitative ANA assay, we have explored an ELISA platform in which plates are pre-coated with a positively charged nucleic acid binding polymer (NABP) to increase adherence of antigens containing DNA or RNA. As a source of antigens, we have used supernatants of Jurkat cells undergoing apoptosis in vitro.

Comparison of the ELISA assay with the PLL <b>pre-coat</b> with a multiplex assay using the BioPlex® 2200 system indicated good agreement in results for a panel of lupus sera. Together, these studies indicate that a <b>pre-coat</b> with a positively charged polymer can increase the sensitivity of an ANA ELISA using as antigens molecules released from dead and dying cells.

Direct thermal printing produces an image when specific chemicals within the coating of thermal paper are heated. 5 Thermal printing technology was first developed in the late 1960 s, and its popularity grew in the 1980 s and 1990 s as it became more cost effective and versatile. This chapter describes {{the components of the}} thermal paper system, its associated equipment, process, and applications, as well as the alternative chemicals analyzed and considered in the alternatives assessment. 3. 1 Components of Thermal Paper Thermal paper is a highly engineered product that is coated with a thermal sensitive layer that reacts in the presence of heat to create the printed image. The following sections describe the key components of thermal paper development, including chemistry and manufacture. This information was useful in evaluating potential alternatives in this application. 3. 1. 1 Paper Thermal paper is a standard paper grade that has been coated with a thermal sensitive layer, also known as a thermal reactive layer (see Figure 3 - 1). A <b>pre-coat,</b> or base coat, is applied to the base paper and allows for high resolution by preventing the heat transfer through all of the paper‟s layers, and for smoothness. Applied to the <b>pre-coat</b> is a thermal layer that contains the necessary reactive components (see Section 3. 1. 2). Additionally, thermal paper may contain a protective top coat and/or back coat. Top coats may be used for some applications to protect thermal paper from mechanical stress or chemical reactions.

40|$|The {{clarification}} of biological feed stocks during {{the production of}} biopharmaceutical proteins is challenging when large quantities of particles must be removed, e. g. when processing crude plant extracts. Single-use depth filters are often preferred for clarification because they are simple to integrate {{and have a good}} safety profile. However, the combination of filter layers must be optimized in terms of nominal retention ratings to account for the unique particle size distribution in each feed stock. We have recently shown that predictive models can facilitate filter screening and the selection of appropriate filter layers. Here we expand our previous study by testing several filters with different retention ratings. The filters typically contain diatomite to facilitate the removal of fine particles. However, diatomite can interfere with the recovery of large biopharmaceutical molecules such as virus-like particles and aggregated proteins. Therefore, we also tested filtration devices composed solely of cellulose fibers and cohesive resin. The capacities of both filter types varied from 10 to 50 L m- 2 when challenged with tobacco leaf extracts, but the filtrate turbidity was ~ 500 -fold lower (~ 3. 5 NTU) when diatomite filters were used. We also tested pre coat filtration with dispersed diatomite, which achieved capacities of up to 120 L m- 2 with turbidities of ~ 100 NTU using bulk plant extracts, and in contrast to the other depth filters did not require an upstream bag filter. Single <b>pre-coat</b> filtration devices can thus replace combinations of bag and depth filters to simplify the processing of plant extracts, potentially saving on time, labor and consumables.

Furthermore, {{it is used to}} confirm the PbI 2 <b>pre-coating</b> influence on the perovskite infiltration into the mesoporous TiO 2 layer (mp-TiO 2) [32]. The PbI 2 <b>pre-coating</b> indeed do not interfere with the perovskite infiltration into the mp-TiO 2 (without PS) based on the BSE intensity comparison between Additional file 1 : Figure S 3 (b) and (c). This is further examined by the elemental mapping (SEM-EDS): the distributions of Pb and I are the same whether the PbI 2 <b>pre-coating</b> is performed or not (Additional file 1 : Figure S 4 (a) and (b)) and whether the TiO 2 layer is altered by the PS sacrificial template or not (Additional file 1 : Figure S 4 (b) and (c)). The BSE intensity and the EDS mapping confirm that the interfacial area between the perovskite and TiO 2 is decreased with the increased PS fraction, since the nanoparticulated-TiO 2 film consisting of ~ 20  nm-sized-nanoparticle has a larger internal surface than the TiO 2 film with the intended ~ 200 -nm micropores. The enlarged perovskite grain by PS incorporation is supported accordingly from the above results.|$|R

Compared to conventional AR-coatings, the nano-structures have a high potential for both cost reduction and increase of performance. A really cost-effective production of polymer films with AR-properties using this technology requires an in-line implementation of this process into a roll-to-roll equipment. The technology should include either a plasma source or an ion source. It allows high productivity, treatment of substrates with process widths of typical industrial web coaters (one meter and more) and can easily be adapted to existing web coaters. A source complying with all these requirements was detected: a dual magnetron with full poisoned (oxidized) targets. The hot negative oxygen ions created on the target surface treat the polymer surface and cause the development of stochastic nano structures.

In this study, we prepared composite resins with grooves that were 2 μm, 1 μm, and 500 nm wide and estimated the effect of <b>pre-coating</b> of some proteins, mainly mucin, on attachment and alignment of human gingival fibroblasts(HGF). In the cell attachment assay on mucin-coated grooves, the number of attached cells on mucin-coated planar or grooved composite resins was lower compared to that on both composite resins without <b>pre-coating</b> of mucin.

Thus it is imperative that an understanding as to the underlying mechanisms and the identification of the key factors involved in adverse effects are gained. In the alveoli, MWCNTs first interact with the pulmonary surfactant. At this interface, proteins and lipids of the pulmonary surfactant bind to MWCNTs, affecting their surface characteristics. Aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate if the <b>pre-coating</b> of MWCNTs with pulmonary surfactant has an influence on potential adverse effects, upon both (i) human monocyte derived macrophages (MDM) monocultures, and (ii) a sophisticated in vitro model of the human epithelial airway barrier. Both in vitro systems were exposed to MWCNTs either pre-coated with a porcine pulmonary surfactant (Curosurf) or not. The effect of MWCNTs surface charge was also investigated in terms of amino (−NH 2) and carboxyl (−COOH) surface modifications. Results <b>Pre-coating</b> of MWCNTs with Curosurf affects their oxidative potential by increasing the reactive oxygen species levels and decreasing intracellular glutathione depletion in MDM as well as decreases the release of Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). In addition, an induction of apoptosis was observed after exposure to Curosurf pre-coated MWCNTs. In triple cell-co cultures the release of Interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) was increased after exposure to Curosurf pre-coated MWCNTs. Effects of the MWCNTs functionalizations were minor in both MDM and triple cell co-cultures. Conclusions The present study clearly indicates that the <b>pre-coating</b> of MWCNTs with pulmonary surfactant more than the functionalization of the tubes is a key factor in determining their ability to cause oxidative stress, cytokine/chemokine release and apoptosis. Thus the coating of nano-objects with pulmonary surfactant should be considered for future lung in vitro risk assessment studies. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to decrease membrane fouling of a ceramic microfiltration system {{and at the same time}} increase the recovery. A conventional operation in micro- and ultrafiltration is an in-line coagulation and a frequent hydraulic backwash. The idea about these frequent backwashes is to limit the accumulation of fouling on the membrane. But the cake layer of iron or alum flocks can also protect the membrane for pore blocking and a frequent backwash can expose the membrane for particles that cause pore blocking. The frequent backwash is also using a lot of permeate. In this way the net flux is lower than the actual flux and the recovery can be as low as 60 to 70 %.

Tests have demonstrated the complete removal of particles 10 micrometers (also microns or µm) and larger with self-cleaning weavewire screen filters and particles 3 microns and larger with thread filter technology...|$|R
40|$|Background Increasing {{concern has}} been {{expressed}} regarding the potential adverse health effects that {{may be associated with}} human exposure to inhaled multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Thus it is imperative that an understanding as to the underlying mechanisms and the identification of the key factors involved in adverse effects are gained. In the alveoli, MWCNTs first interact with the pulmonary surfactant. At this interface, proteins and lipids of the pulmonary surfactant bind to MWCNTs, affecting their surface characteristics. Aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate if the <b>pre-coating</b> of MWCNTs with pulmonary surfactant has an influence on potential adverse effects, upon both (i) human monocyte derived macrophages (MDM) monocultures, and (ii) a sophisticated in vitro model of the human epithelial airway barrier. Both in vitro systems were exposed to MWCNTs either pre-coated with a porcine pulmonary surfactant (Curosurf) or not. The effect of MWCNTs surface charge was also investigated in terms of amino (−NH 2) and carboxyl (−COOH) surface modifications. Results <b>Pre-coating</b> of MWCNTs with Curosurf affects their oxidative potential by increasing the reactive oxygen species levels and decreasing intracellular glutathione depletion in MDM as well as decreases the release of Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). In addition, an induction of apoptosis was observed after exposure to Curosurf pre-coated MWCNTs. In triple cell-co cultures the release of Interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) was increased after exposure to Curosurf pre-coated MWCNTs. Effects of the MWCNTs functionalizations were minor in both MDM and triple cell co-cultures. Conclusions The present study clearly indicates that the <b>pre-coating</b> of MWCNTs with pulmonary surfactant more than the functionalization of the tubes is a key factor in determining their ability to cause oxidative stress, cytokine/chemokine release and apoptosis. Thus the coating of nano-objects with pulmonary surfactant should be considered for future lung in vitro risk assessment studies.

30|$|In Switzerland, four {{identical}} solar monocrystalline {{panels are}} used {{for the application of}} self-cleaning testing under natural weather conditions. <b>Pre-coating,</b> post-coating and extremity tests were conducted, respectively. Our experimental results reveal that the coated panel generated ~ 3.6  % more energy than that with uncoated panel in a post-coating test. In an extremity test, the coated panel generated ~ 5.4  % more energy than the one with an uncoated panel in short term test thanks to several major merits of the Nano-TiO 2 coating.|$|R
