25|$|The New Zealand scallop {{is a large}} fan-shaped shellfish, flat on {{one side}} and convex on the other. It lives on the bottom of coastal waters, 30 metres or more deep. Scallop spat-collecting bags are {{suspended}} during summer in coastal areas with high natural scallop settlement. The scallop larvae settle out of the plankton onto the fine feathery surface of the <b>plastic</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>bags.</b> The larvae are allowed to grow to a suitable size and are then released onto known natural scallop beds at densities of about six per square metre of sea floor. There, they are later harvested on a rotational basis by dredges. This technique has resulted in a marked increase and stabilising of the available annual catch. The Tasman scallop fishery, near collapse in the 1980s, recovered with re-seeding to a level where 747 tonnes were harvested in 2004.|$|R

The recruitment rate of juveniles of L. caudata was studied every 30 days over a year. The bivalve culture enclosures were suspended {{in the water column}} at two sites in the Gulf of Cariaco (northeastern Venezuela) characterized by different oceanographic and environmental conditions; Turpialito and an internal area of Laguna Grande del Obispo (LGO). Environmental variables including temperature, chlorophyll a, total (organic and inorganic) seston and wind intensity were recorded. The sea urchin Echinometra lucunter was placed on culture baskets as a predator (biocontrol). <b>Plastic</b> <b>mesh</b> cultivation <b>bags</b> were also tested as an alternative method to prevent or decrease the recruitment of these predators at Turpialito. The results showed a significantly higher number of predators at Turpialito than in the sheltered LGO site in May, June and July only. During the period of intense predator recruitment, principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that chlorophyll a, organic seston and wind strength were directly related to predator recruitment. During the period of less intense predator recruitment when wind intensity was lower, PCA showed that the same variables were directly related to predator recruitment whereas temperature showed an inverse relationship. In contrast, no relationship between recruitment of predators and environmental variables could be established for the LGO site. However, predator recruitment at LGO was significantly lower in the <b>plastic</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>bags</b> than in Spanish baskets, and {{in the presence of the}} sea urchin Echinometra lucunter.

The dicot species Bixa, Theobroma and Bertholletia clearly responded to a soil enrichment with nitrate. The results were statistically significant for Bixa (p < 0. 001). Theobroma and Bixa responded in a very similar way to the nutrient treatments. Bixa exploited the nutrient enriched soil patches most efficiently through its high root length density.

To examine effects {{of natural and}} artificial structure on the abundance of intertidal juvenile crabs, 2 experiments were conducted in Kingston Bay, Massachusetts, USA, from July to September, 2012. In the first experiment, structure was manipulated in a two-factor design that {{was placed in the}} high intertidal for 3 one-week periods to test for both substrate type (sand vs. rock) and {{the presence or absence of}} artificial structure (<b>mesh</b> grow-out <b>bags</b> used in aquaculture, ∼ 0. 5 m 2 with 62 mm 2 mesh openings).

Most green crabs were small (< 6 mm in carapace width) whereas H. sanguineus occurred in a wide range of sizes. In the second experiment, 3 levels of oyster-shell treatments were established using grow-out bags placed on a muddy sand substrate in the low intertidal zone: <b>mesh</b> grow-out <b>bags</b> without shells, grow-out bags with oyster shells, and grow-out bags containing live oysters. Replicate bags were deployed weekly for 7 weeks in a randomized complete block design.

To investigate the structure and composition of the aquatic invertebrate community during the process of leaf decomposition of two plant species present {{along the banks of the}} stream studied, 21 <b>plastic</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>bags</b> containing 2. 5 g (dry weight) of leaf matter from each species (Alchornea glandulosa (Vell) and Cabralea canjerana End. and Poeppig), for a total of 5. 0 g, were placed in the streambed. Three bags were removed after 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 48 and 96 days. The taxonomic density was negatively correlated with the remaining weight. The high density of collector organisms, such as Chironomidae, Oligochaeta and Amphipoda, on the last day of incubation, probably occurred due to the increased amount of fine organic matter in the more advanced decomposition stages. The highest &# 945; diversity (Shannon-Wiener) values were observed for the 3 rd and 96 th days of the experiment, while the &# 946; diversity values showed that these days presented the highest variation in the taxonomic composition, thus presenting a different faunistic composition. This study showed that the trophic structure and composition of aquatic invertebrates changes during the decomposition of leaf litter. The faunistic abundance and diversity observed in this study indicate that the entrance of material from plants growing along streams provides favorable conditions for the colonisation and establishment of invertebrates in lower-order streams, and thus points to the need to preserve riparian vegetation...|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} oyster culture in France {{consists}} of a succession of development phases with different species, followed by collapses caused by diseases. The indigenous species Ostrea edulis was replaced fi rst with Crassostrea angulata, then Crassostrea gigas. France is now the top producer and consumer of oysters in Europe, producing around 130, 000 tonnes of the cupped oyster C. gigas annually and a remaining 1, 500 tonnes of the fl at oyster O. edulis. Cupped oysters are produced all along the French coast from natural (80 %) and hatchery spat. Various structures are used to collect spat from the wild. After a growing-on period, oysters can be cultivated by three main methods: (i) on-bottom culture in the intertidal zone or in deep water; (ii) off-bottom culture in <b>plastic</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>bags</b> in the intertidal zone; or (iii) suspended culture on ropes in the open sea. The principal development {{that has taken place}} in culture techniques is the use of oysters produced in hatcheries, especially triploids. Almost all French oyster production is sold fresh and eaten raw straight from the shell. There is a strong seasonality in sales, with the most being made during the Christmas and New Year period. The abundant production and the lack of market organisation induce strong competition between the different production areas, causing prices to fall. In order to overcome this difficulty, oyster farmers have developed strategies of sales promotion and regional quality labelling. The hazards of production are numerous: environmental crises (microbiological pollution, toxic microalgae), unexplained mortality, overstocking etc. Recently, new problems with toxic algae have disrupted oyster sales. However, French oyster culture has many assets. These include a coastal environment offering favourable sites for mollusc growth and reproduction.

500|$|The Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is {{cultivated}} {{by similar}} methods but in larger volumes {{and in many}} more regions of the world. This oyster originated in Japan {{where it has been}} cultivated for many centuries. It is an estuarine species and prefers salinities of 20 to 25 parts per thousand. Breeding programmes have produced improved stock that is available from hatcheries. A single female oyster can produce 50–80 million eggs in a batch so the selection of broodstock is of great importance. The larvae are grown on in tanks of static or moving water. They are fed high quality microalgae and diatoms and grow fast. At metamorphosis the juveniles may be allowed to settle on PVC sheets or pipes, or crushed shell. In some cases, they continue their development in [...] "upwelling culture" [...] in large tanks of moving water rather than being allowed to settle on the bottom. They then may be transferred to transitional, nursery beds before being moved to their final rearing quarters. Culture there takes place on the bottom, in <b>plastic</b> trays, in <b>mesh</b> <b>bags,</b> on rafts or on long lines, either in shallow water or in the intertidal zone. The oysters are ready for harvesting in 18 to 30 months depending on the size required.|$|R

In order to restore nutrient content wood ash has been suggested as a fertiliser. Ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi arc involved in the nutrient uptake of forest trees and this study investigates the influence of intensive harvesting and wood ash fertilisation on the external EM mycelium in forest soil. Nylon <b>mesh</b> <b>bags</b> filled with sand were buried in September 1997 in field plots which had or had not been intensively harvested.

Organic mulches were used to enhance biological degradation of vine debris to reduce levels of B. cinerea primary inoculum the following season. Four mulch types (anaerobically and aerobically fermented marc (grape pressings), inter-row grass clippings and shredded office paper) were applied under ten-year-old Riesling vines in a ten-replicate randomized block design in New Zealand over two consecutive years. <b>Plastic</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>bags,</b> each containing naturally infected vine debris, were placed under vines on bare ground (control) and at the soil-mulch interface, in winter (July) 2003 and 2004. In each year, half the bags were recovered at flowering (December) and the remainder at leaf plucking (February), for assessment of B. cinerea sporulation from the vine debris and debris degradation rate. Bait lamina probes, which measure soil biological activity, {{were placed in the}} soil-mulch interface three weeks before each of the two bag-recovery dates in both years and were then removed and assessed at the same times as were the bags. All mulches led to a reduction in B. cinerea sporulation. This reduction was significantly correlated with elevated rates of vine debris decomposition and increased soil biological activity. Over both years, compared with the controls, all treatments gave a 3 - 20 -fold reduction in B. cinerea sporulation, a 1. 6 - 2. 6 -fold increase in vine debris degradation and in the two marc and the paper treatments, a 1. 8 - 4 -fold increase in activity of soil organisms. The mulches also altered vine characteristics and elevated their resistance to B. cinerea through changes to the soil environment. Functional soil biological activity, as measured by Biolog Ecoplates and bait lamina probes, was increased 2 - 4 times in the two marc and paper treatments, compared with the control, an effect relating to the elevated soil moisture and reduced temperature fluctuations under these mulches. Soil nutrient levels and the C:N ratios were also affected in these treatments. The mulched paper lowered vine canopy density by up to 1. 4 times that of the other treatments, an effect which probably led to elevated light penetration into the canopy and consequent increased canopy temperature, photosynthesis and lowered canopy humidity. These changes to soil and vine characteristics increased grape skin strength by up to 10 % in the paper treatment and sugar concentrations by 1. 2 - 1. 4 °Brix in the two marc and paper treatments. The severity of B. cinerea infections in the anaerobic marc, aerobic marc and paper treatments were reduced to 12 %, 3 % and 2. 2 % of the control, respectively, in field assessments averaged over two consecutive harvests. Cover crops mulched in situ had similar effects to those of the organic mulches, increasing soil biological activity and reducing B. cinerea primary inoculum and the severity of B. cinerea infection in grapes at harvest (2006). Inter-row phacelia and ryegrass were mulched in winter 2005 and compared with a bare ground control, under 10 -year-old Chardonnay vines in a ten-replicate randomized block design. Functional soil biological activity increased by 1. 5 - 4. 5 times in the two cover crop treatments compared with the control, an effect possibly related to elevated soil moisture in these treatments. This increase in soil moisture and soil biological activity increased vine debris degradation, reduced B. cinerea primary inoculum on the debris and decreased B. cinerea severity at flowering (December 2005) and harvest (April 2006).

This shows that EM fungi {{may play a role in}} ameliorating phosphorus limitation, but will probably not ameliorate potassium limitation. Fertilization with hardened wood ash has been suggested as a means of ameliorating nutrient depletion caused by WTH. The elemental content in EMM growing close to apatite and wood ash was investigated by studying the particle-induced X-ray emission from mycelial samples. The content of calcium increased in the EMM, indicating that the EMM had interacted with the apatite and wood ash. Some elements are taken up by EM fungi and transported to the host roots, but will not be taken up by the host tree and will instead accumulate in the EM roots. Rare-earth elements (REE) are examples of such elements and apatite also contains relatively high amounts of REE. The contents of light REE (La to Gd) were increased by 10 to 100 times in EM roots growing close to apatite-amended <b>mesh</b> <b>bags</b> compared with sand-filled <b>mesh</b> <b>bags.</b> In forest stands with a poor P status 6. 2 mu-g light REE accumulated in EM roots outside apatite-amended <b>mesh</b> <b>bags,</b> while the corresponding figure in forest stands with an adequate P status was 4. 2 mu-g. Apatite is the main source of phosphorus by weathering, and such an increase in the weathering rate could cover a quarter of the calculated P depletion induced by WTH in forests in southern Sweden, given that the amount of EM roots and EMM increase in the mineral soil in the forest...|$|R
30|$|For both experiments, double layered {{permeable}} nylon <b>mesh</b> <b>bags</b> of size 15  cm[*]×[*] 35  cm {{were prepared}} for seed burial to create the natural soil environment. In many of the earlier studies (e.g., Omami et al. 1999; Narwal et al. 2008) {{a large number of}} seeds mixed with soils were placed in small bags, usually 10  cm[*]×[*] 10  cm. However, high seed density in the <b>mesh</b> <b>bags</b> may influence seed mortality because of elevation of pathogen levels as it is higher than the natural density in the soil bank (Van Mourik, et al. 2005). In this experiment a more ideal proportion of soil to seed mixture was used as suggested by Teo-Sherrell et al. (1996). Accordingly, 50 seeds from the intended samples were mixed with 500  g of sieved soil in the <b>mesh</b> <b>bag.</b> The soil was collected at Melkassa Agricultural Research Center where the species was not grown for more than three years. Paper labels sealed in polythene bags were placed in each <b>mesh</b> <b>bag</b> for identification of samples during exhumation. In order to prevent loss of seeds from the bags and to avoid entrance of soils and other species weed seeds, the bags were tightly fastened and buried in horizontal position. The bags were buried with their colored strings extended to the outside of the soil for easy detection of the bags during exhumation as suggested by Van (2005). They were buried 50  cm apart from one another in a grid. The field was previously used for conducting other crop experiments and has been extensively disturbed. However, during the duration of the experiment it was kept undisturbed (no cultivation).|$|R

40|$|A {{substantial}} portion of the carbon (C) fixed by the trees is allocated belowground to ectomycorrhizal (EM) symbionts, but this fraction usually declines after fertilization. The aim {{of the present study was}} to estimate the effect of optimal fertilization (including all the necessary nutrients) on the growth of EM fungi in young Norway spruce forests over a three year period. In addition, the amount of carbon sequestered by EM mycelia was estimated using a method based on the difference in delta C- 13 between C- 3 and C- 4 plants. Sand-filled ingrowth <b>mesh</b> <b>bags</b> were used to estimate EM growth, and similar bags amended with compost made from maize leaves (a C- 4 plant) were used to estimate C sequestration. Fertilizers had been applied either every year or every second year since 2002 and the estimates of EM growth started in 2007. The application of fertilizer reduced EM growth to between 0 % and 40 % of the growth in the control plots at one site (Ebbegarde), while no significant effect was found at the other three sites studied. The effect of the fertilizer was similar in sand-filled and maize-compost-amended <b>mesh</b> <b>bags,</b> but the total production of EM fungi was 3 - 4 times higher in maize-compost-amended <b>mesh</b> <b>bags.</b> The fertilizer tended to reduce EM growth more when applied every year than when applied every second year. The amount of C sequestered in maize-compost-amended <b>mesh</b> <b>bags</b> collected from unfertilized treatments was estimated to be between 0. 2 and 0. 7 mg C g sand(- 1) at Ebbegarde and between 0. 2 and 0. 5 mg C g sand(- 1) at Grangshammar. This corresponds to between 300 and 1100 kg C per ha, assuming a similar production in the soil as in the <b>mesh</b> <b>bags.</b> Fertilization at the Ebbegarde site reduced carbon sequestration, which confirmed the results based on estimates of fungal growth (ergosterol levels). A correlation was found between fungal biomass and delta C- 13 in <b>mesh</b> <b>bags</b> amended with maize compost. Based on this, it was estimated that a fungal production of 1 mu g ergosterol corresponded to 0. 33 mg of sequestered carbon. In conclusion, the effect of the fertilizer on EM growth seemed to be dependent on the effect of the fertilizer on tree growth. Thus, at Ebbegarde, were tree growth was less stimulated by the fertilizer, EM growth was reduced upon fertilization. At other sites, where tree growth was more stimulated, the fertilizer did not influence EM growth. The large amounts of carbon sequestered during the experiment may be a result of fungal residues remaining in the soil after the death of the hyphae. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.
