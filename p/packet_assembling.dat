This research develops a new framework {{to manage the}} bandwidth in buffer-less slotted all-optical packet-switched networks suitable {{for the next generation}} IP networks where the quality of service must be addressed. We first present an ingress switch architecture along with a new control and signaling structure for the slotted-OPS network. Then we design different components of our ingress switch architecture including packet scheduling, retransmission management, and bandwidth access units. A class-based packet scheduling is designed to reduce the inter-transmission time from different source routers, and to provide packet differentiation so that fairness issues for DiffServ support are addressed and resolved. The contention problem at the core switch is studied. Inexpensive contention avoidance and resolution schemes in the optical domain are considered. For contention avoidance, we have used the software approach from the ingress switch, while for contention resolution we have analyzed the prioritized retransmission technique {{to limit the number of}} retransmissions, and to improve network throughput. We have also designed new algorithms in core switches to resolve contention for class-based traffic. A new contention-based DTDM (Distributed TDM) bandwidth access technique is designed in which the ingress switches can evenly distribute traffic among available wavelengths and fibers. It can shape the traffic which plays an important role in reducing loss rate when accessing a slotted all-optical OPS network. The DTDM technique is further improved in an integrated scheme in a slotted all-optical single-hop OPS network that can benefit from the positive aspects of the centralized reservation-based scheme during high traffic load. The AAPN (Agile All-Photonic Network) network using the integrated technique is illustrated as an example. In summary, all the above methods are utilized to build our OPS network architecture.

To address the optimal DBs size problem, we use an estimate of throughput obtained through individual TCP connections sharing a common router. The effect on synchronization is thus taken into account. A classical optimization technique is then applied to the resulting goodput formula to determine the optimal size.

40|$|Abstract — Optical burst {{switching}} (OBS) is a switching {{technique that}} was proposed as a hybrid switching technology {{to support the}} next generation Internet. In OBS, incoming IP <b>packets</b> are <b>assembled</b> into super-sized <b>packets</b> called data bursts. Burst contention is a well-known challenging problem in Optical Burst Switching (OBS) networks. Burst contention can be resolved using several approaches, such as wavelength conversion, buffering based on fiber delay line (FDL) or deflection routing Retransmission technique is used to reduce the Burst Loss Ratio (BLR) by deflecting dropped bursts. Segmentation also resolves contention by dividing the contended burst into smaller parts called segments. Combining deflection routing technique and retransmission technique outperforms both pure deflection and pure retransmission techniques to improve the performance. Previous work uses only static combination of retransmission and deflection of bursts to reduce contention. This paper proposes a dynamic protocol to resolve contention based on combining deflection, retransmission and delaying bursts to improve the OBS performance. Experiments were conducted to test the proposed protocol. The proposed technique was tested on complex models such as NSFNET and COST 238 topologies. Results show that the proposed protocol outperforms existing techniques in terms of burst lost ratio. Index Terms — OBS networks, contention resolution techniques, retransmission techniques...|$|R

40|$|Summary Optical burst {{switching}} (OBS) is {{the most}} favourable switching paradigm for future all-optical networks. Burst assembly is the first process in OBS and it consists of aggregating clients <b>packets</b> into bursts. <b>Assembled</b> bursts wait for an offset time before being transmitted to their intended destinations. Offset time is used to allow burst control packet reserve required resources prior to burst arrival. Burst assembly process and offset-time create extra delay in OBS networks. To make OBS suitable for real time applications, this extra latency needs to be controlled. This paper proposes and evaluates a novel offset time and burst assembly scheme to address this issue. Constant bit rate (CBR) traffic that has stringent end-to-end delay QoS requirements is used in this study. The proposed scheme is called hybrid offset-time and burst assembly algorithm (H-OTBA). The objective of the paper is achieved by controlling maximum burst transfer delay parameters of CBR. The proposed scheme was evaluated via network simulation. Simulation results demonstrate that, H-OTBA has effectively reduced end-to-end delay for CBR traffic compared with current solutions...|$|R

Depending on the core node’s switching technology, data bursts are required to have a minimum length. On the other hand, each IP packet in a burst has a time delay constraint, called maximum end-to-end delay, which determines the upper time limit before which the packet must reach its destination. Thus, a data burst cannot wait indefinitely until a sufficient number of IP <b>packets</b> are <b>assembled</b> and the minimum burst length requirement is met. In order to satisfy the packet maximum end-to-end delay requirement, many bursts will be timed out and released before they reach the minimumlength requirement. Under such circumstances, padding overhead must be added to these short bursts, called sub-bursts. Excessive padding results in high overhead and high data-burst blocking probability. One approach to minimize the amount of padding overhead, while maintaining the end-to-end delay requirement of IP packets, is to groom multiple sub-bursts together. That is, sub-bursts with different destinations are aggregated together at the edge node and transmitted as a single burst until they are separated at some downstream node. In this paper, we present an edge-node architecture enabling burst-grooming capability. We also develop two basic grooming approaches, namely No routing overhead (NoRO) and minimum total overhead (MinTO). Through a comprehensive simulation study, we show that, in general, our proposed grooming algorithms can significantly improve the performance compared to the case of no grooming. However, careful considerations must be given to network-loading conditions and the number of sub-bursts allowed to be groomed together. We show that although simple greedy algorithms can reduce network overhead, they may alter the traffic characteristics and increase its burstiness, resulting in high packet blocking probability.

40|$|Abstract — While network-level {{multicast}} {{has tremendous}} potential {{for increasing the}} efficiency of grouporiented applications, the adoption of network-level multicast has been tepid at best. In the absence of full multicast support in the network, group-oriented application developers are forced to turn to either Application-Level Multicast (ALM) or separate unicasts. Although ALM does introduce the basic efficiency of multicast, ALM requires active modifications to the application and {{does not provide a}} clear incentive for pursuing global networklevel multicast support. In this paper, we propose a novel concept entitled stealth multicast that allows for practical adoption of network-level multicast on a domain-wise basis rather than global scale. In the stealth multicast model, similar unicast <b>packets</b> are dynamically <b>assembled</b> into virtual groups for multicast transmission across the domain. At the edge of the domain, the packets are converted back to unicast, thus hiding the existence of stealth multicast from the external Internet. True to its namesake, stealth multicast operates in complete stealth, providing seamless interoperability without requiring any modifications to end-user applications nor requiring any inter-domain support. In this paper, we introduce the basic concepts of stealth multicast and show that the stealth multicast model can offer significant benefits in terms of bandwidth savings with minimal impact to the end-user QoS...|$|R
40|$|Three typical {{types of}} traffic demands in a core WDM network are assumed in this work, {{requiring}} single wavelength services, guaranteed-bandwidth IP services or best-effort IP services respectively. Each {{type of traffic}} is characterized by average holding time and average bandwidth. We considered the following two wavelength-routing (augmented with traffic grooming) approaches. The first approach is single-hop optical circuit-switching (or SHOCS) where any data (IP packets) is only groomed at its ingress node, and then routed to its egress node directly over one lightpath. The second approach we considered, called two-hop OCS (or THOCS), tries to facilitate more edge grooming via a two-hop routing. More specifically, it routes most of the data from its source to some intermediate nodes over existing lightpaths in the first step (hop), and then from an intermediate node to the final destination over another lightpath in the second step (hop). The third approach we consider, called Polymorphous Optical Burst Switching (or POBS) [3], grooms different types of traffic differently by using an integrated signaling framework to seamless support both OCS and OBS. It emulates OCS, and in particular SHOCS, for the wavelength services and guaranteed-bandwidth IP services by using traffic grooming at the source and establishing direct lightpaths to destinations. On the other hand, it emulates OBS for the best-effort IP services by <b>assembling</b> <b>packets</b> having the same destination into bursts and transmitting them without setting up a lightpath {{in an attempt to}} reduce signaling delay and achieve statistical multiplexing gains.

40|$|The {{demand of}} network {{capacity}} {{has been increasing}} steadily with more users than ever connected to the Internet through broadband access and the popularity of video based applications, such as YouTube. Optical wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) networks are expected to form the next-generation backbone network and to fulfill the insatiable appetite for bandwidth. Wavelength routed WDM optical networks offer the granularity of switching at a fiber, waveband, or a wavelength level. The finest granularity offered is at a wavelength level by provisioning lightpaths for different clients/services. All-optical packet switching is still deemed technically infeasible and its competitiveness as a backbone technology is debatable. Optical burst switching (OBS) presents itself as a promising technology for bridging the gap between optical wavelength switching and optical packet switching. OBS operates at the sub-wavelength level and is designed to improve the bandwidth utilization of wavelengths by exploring statistical multiplexing to deal with bursty traffic, and is therefore more resource efficient than optical wavelength switching. In OBS networks, arriving data packets (e. g., IP <b>packets)</b> are <b>assembled</b> at the ingress OBS nodes to form a data burst. A burst control packet (CP) is sent on a control channel ahead of the data burst to reserve resources and configure the switches along the route traversed by the data burst. In this dissertation, we will explore several important and challenging issues in OBS networks {{in order to improve}} the utilization of network resource. To reduce the switching overhead, small bursts may be groomed to reduce resource waste and switching penalty. We have studied the per-hop burst grooming problem where bursts with the same next hop may be groomed together to minimize the number of formed larger bursts and strike a proper balance between burst grooming and grooming cost, assuming all the network nodes have the grooming capability. In order to reduce computation overhead and processing delay incurred at the core nodes, we assume that grooming can only be performed at edge nodes and the core node can send a burst to multiple downstream links, that is, the core node has light-splitting capability. We have attempted to groom small bursts into larger bursts, and select a proper route for each large burst, such that total network resources used and/or wasted for delivering the small bursts is minimized. Optical signal transmission quality is subject to various types of physical impairment introduced by optical fibers, switching equipment, or other network components. The signal degradation due to physical impairment may be significant enough such that the bit-error rate of received signals is unacceptably high at the destination, rendering the signal not usable. Based on earlier work, we have studied scheduling and QoS provisioning problems in OBS networks, taking physical impairments into consideration. In the context of the JET signaling protocol, we have studied the burst scheduling problem and proposed three effective burst scheduling algorithms in OBS networks, taking into account physical impairment effects. Because the offset time of bursts varies in OBS networks, the voids or fragmentation on the channels in the outgoing links can severely degrade the network throughput and blocking probability performance, if not dealt with carefully. A signalling architecture called Dual-header Optical Burst Switching (DOBS) is proposed to reduce the scheduling algorithm complexity. We study the burst scheduling problem and propose an impairment aware scheduling algorithm in DOBS networks. QoS provisioning is an important issue in OBS networks. We have dealt with relative QoS support problem and proposed a QoS provisioning algorithm subject to the physical impairment constraints. A high-priority [...] ...|$|R
