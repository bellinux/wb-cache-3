This is the first attempt so far to quantify component fluxes with stable isotopes over the period of 3 weeks, enabling us to investigate the impact of environmental factors on the partitioned fluxes. Large variability in environmental conditions during the 3 -week measurement campaign led to strong changes in isotopic disequilibrium between assimilation and respiration, ranging from 1 to 5 %. Although this approach is still associated with large uncertainty, we found reasonable patterns in ecosystem respiration and assimilation, and a significant correlation of daytime respiration with soil temperature (R- 2 = 0. 48). The ratio of respiration to assimilation was highly variable on a day-to-day basis, ranging from 10 % to more than 25 %. This ratio was mainly controlled by soil temperature (R- 2 = 0. 61), indicating a strong sensitivity of ecosystem carbon dynamics to temperature changes and higher carbon uptake efficiency during cooler days.

We present the first evidence that an enclosed CAM-dominated soil and plant community exposed to a substantial day/night temperature difference (30 / 20 °C), exhibits a diel gas exchange pattern consisting of four consecutive phases with a distinct nocturnal CO 2 uptake. These phases were modulated by plant assimilation and soil respiration processes. Day-time stomatal closure of the CAM cycle during phase III was used to eliminate aboveground photosynthetic assimilation and respiration and thereby to estimate belowground plant plus soil respiration.

To assess the relative utility of the available methods, we studied an ecosystem associated with large CO 2 fluxes and maximal isotopic exchange. Three independent techniques were used to measure isotopic flux densities over an irrigated alfalfa field: (1) a combination of standard eddy covariance and flask sampling; (2) the flux-gradient method; and (3) hyperbolic relaxed eddy accumulation (HREA).

Field collected sediments were highly anoxic and the ratio of simultaneously extractable metal (ΣSEM) to acid volatile sulfide (AVS) was much less than one in these sediments. The majority (> 67 %) of Cd, Pb, and Zn were bound to AVS, thus their concentrations in the sediment porewater were low. In contrast, Ni was little bound to AVS due to its lower ratios of SEM-Ni to total Ni concentrations. For Cu, relatively high concentrations in the sediment porewater was found, and total organic carbon, AVS and other resistant sulfide phase were the controlling factors for sedimentary Cu <b>partitioning.</b> <b>Net</b> metal adsorption from gut juices to anoxic sediments was observed in metal extraction experiments, suggesting that AVS determined the bioaccumulation and potential bioavailability of most metals in these sediments. Extraction of metals from the oxidized sediments by the gut juices was mainly attributed to metal redistribution from AVS to other geochemical phases. The gut juices were the most effective solvent or extractant than the simple electrolyte solution [I (NaNO 3) = 0. 01 M] and the natural overlying water. Cd was more easily extracted from the oxidized sediments than Zn that tended to have a stronger binding affinity with Fe-Mn oxide, clay and organic matter.

40|$|Water stable {{isotopes}} {{are powerful}} tools for <b>partitioning</b> <b>net</b> into raw water fluxes such as evapotranspiration (ET) into soil evaporation (E) and plant transpiration (T). The isotopic methodology for ET partitioning {{is based on}} the fact that E and T have distinct water stable isotopic compositions, which in turn relies on the fact that each flux is differently affected by isotopic kinetic effects. An important work to be performed in parallel to field measurements is to better characterize these kinetic effects in the laboratory under controlled conditions. A soil evaporation laboratory experiment was conducted to retrieve characteristic values of the kinetic fractionation factor (αK) under varying soil and atmospheric water conditions. For this we used a combined soil and atmosphere column to monitor the soil and atmospheric water isotopic composition profiles at a high temporal and vertical resolution in a nondestructive manner by combining micro-porous membranes and laser spectroscopy. αK was calculated by using a well-known isotopic evaporation model in an inverse mode with the isotopic composition of E as one input variable, which was determined using a micro-Keeling regression plot. Knowledge on αK was further used in the field (Selhausen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany) to partition ET of catch crops and sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) during one growing season. Soil and atmospheric water isotopic profiles were measured automatically across depths and heights following a similar modus operandi as in the laboratory experiment. Additionally, a newly developed continuously moving elevator was used to obtain water vapor isotopic composition profiles with a high vertical resolution between soil surface, plant canopy and atmosphere. Finally, soil and plant samples were collected destructively to provide a comparison with the traditional isotopic methods.

The model {{is based on the}} <b>partition</b> of <b>net</b> radiation between the components of the canopy (vines, soil, and grass cover), considering that the vines and the undercover (soil plus grass cover) act separately and in parallel. Thus, the latent heat flux from the vines to the atmosphere (lTc) is determined from vine net radiation (Rnc) and sensible heat flux (Hc). The <b>partition</b> of <b>net</b> radiation (Rn) between the undercover (Rns) and the vines (Rnc) is made considering the exponential form for radiation extinction, with the coefficient of extinction being corrected with a factor dependent on the zenital solar angle (j) while leaf area index (LAI) is corrected with a clumping factor, Ω(φ). Sensible heat flux from the vines (Hc) is calculated from radiative temperature (Tc) considering that the fluxes from the different origins are independent and that there are two resistances in series between the canopy and the atmosphere: the leaf boundary layer resistance (raHc) and the aerodynamic resistance of the crop (raH). Besides the estimation of the daily values of transpiration, the model allows to study the evolution of the different components of the radiation balance throughout the day. The daily evolution of the evaporation fraction from the vines (FEc) can be approximated by a concave curve. Values of FEc > 1 show that, under certain circumstances and periods of the day, energy used for transpiration (lTc) is greater than crop net radiation, which indicates that there are exchanges of energy between the several components of the surface, namely when evaporative demand from the atmosphere is high and there are no soil water restrictions.

Our measurements across a permafrost thaw gradient, going from permafrost-dominated, well-drained palsas to intermediate permafrost sites dominated by Sphagnum spp. to wet sites with no underlying permafrost, dominated by Eriophorum angustifolium, show both large increases in productivity and CH 4 emissions as well as shifts in the CH 4 production pathway. Across this permafrost thaw gradient the isotopic composition of CH 4 becomes 13 C enriched, due to increased acetoclastic CH 4 production. While the palsa sites have no detectable CH 4 emissions, fluxes in the Sphagnum site have an average isotopic composition of - 79 ‰, a value indicative of CH 4 production dominated by CO 2 reduction, in contrast the isotopic composition of CH 4 produced in the Eriophorum sites ranged from - 71 to - 57 ‰, showing increased CH 4 production via the acetate pathway. We also observed an increase in acetoclastic methanogenesis as the growing season progressed. Together, these initial results suggest that thaw induced changes in hydrology and plant community composition increase peat lability, stimulating acetate fermentation and yielding increased methane emissions. We conclude that the biological controls on metabolic pathways of methanogenesis, though poorly represented in most ecosystem models, may nonetheless be important, in interaction with permafrost thaw dynamics, in determining future CH 4 emissions under changing climate...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} during the growing seasons of 1979, 1980 and 1981 to evaluate the microclimate of a soybean (Glycine max L., Merrill) canopy and to {{determine the influence of}} alterations in plant architectural characteristics on its mass and energy exchanges. A Clark cv. canopy was studied in 1979. Two Harosoy cv. isolines differing in leaf pubescence density were studied in 1980 and two Clark cv. isolines differing in leaf width were studied in 1981. Fluxes of CO(, 2), water vapor, sensible heat and momentum were measured by means of micrometeorological techniques. Crop water status was monitored by means of leaf water potential and stomatal resistance measurements. Soil moisture measurements were made gravimetrically and with a neutron probe. ^ Considerable variability was observed in the wind speed regime within the canopy. Wind speeds were greater between rows than within the row. A reversal in the wind speed gradient was also found to occur in the lower portion of the canopy within the row. Increasing turbulent mixing distorted the canopy shape and increased wind speeds in the canopy. ^ Canopy CO(, 2) fluxes did not indicate a light-saturated photosynthetic mechanism. CO(, 2) fluxes did, however, decrease dramatically as air temperatures exceeded 32 C and leaf water potentials dropped below - 1. 1 MPa. CO(, 2) -water flux ratios (CWFR) decreased with increases in net radiation and stomatal resistance. ^ A soybean isogene having increased leaf pubescence was found to have reduced water vapor exchange and increased sensible heat exchange. Leaf pubescence altered the <b>partitioning</b> of <b>net</b> radiation by facilitating the penetration of solar radiation into the canopy. Canopy CO(, 2) exchange, crop water status and turbulent mixing were unaffected by leaf pubescence whereas CWFR was improved. ^ A reduction in leaf width reduced water vapor exchange and increased sensible heat exchange. Net radiation, however, was not affected. The differential <b>partitioning</b> of <b>net</b> radiation was due to better penetration of solar radiation in the narrow-leaf canopy since it had a lower total leaf area. Better distribution of light also caused CO(, 2) exchange on a leaf area basis to be greater in that canopy. Furthermore, greater CWFR was observed over the narrow-leafed isoline. Turbulent mixing was greater over the normal isoline when both canopies were fully-developed. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{magnitude}} of fractionation during photorespiration {{and the effect}} on net photosynthetic 13 C discrimination (D) were investigated for three Senecio species, S. squalidus, S. cineraria, and S. greyii. Wedetermined the contributions of different processes during photosynthesis to D by comparing observations (Dobs) with discrimination predicted from gas-exchange measurements (Dpred). Photorespiration rates were manipulated by altering the O 2 partial pressure (pO 2) in the air surrounding the leaves. Contributions from 13 C-depleted photorespiratory CO 2 were largest at high pO 2. The parameters for photorespiratory fraction-ation (f), net fractionation during carboxylation by Rubisco and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (b), and mesophyll conduc-tance (gi) were determined simultaneously for all measurements. Instead of using Dobs data to obtain gi and f successively, which requires that b is known,we treated b, f, and gi as unknowns. Wepropose this as an alternative approach to analyzemeasurements under field conditions when b and gi are not known or cannot be determined in separate experiments. Good agreement between modeled and observedDwas achievedwith f 5 11. 6 & 6 1. 5 &, b 5 26. 0 & 6 0. 3 &, and gi of 0. 276 0. 01, 0. 256 0. 01, and 0. 226 0. 01 molm 22 s 21 for S. squalidus, S. cineraria, and S. greyii, respectively. We estimate that photorespiratory fractionation decreases D by about 1. 2 & on average under field conditions. In addition, diurnal changes inD are likely to reflect variations in photorespiration even at the canopy level. Our results emphasize {{that the effects of}} photorespirationmust be taken into account when <b>partitioning</b> <b>net</b> CO 2 exchange of ecosystems into gross fluxes of photosynthesis and respiration. Development of the theory linking the d 13 C signa-tures of plant CO 2 fluxes or organic material to leaf gas exchange (Farquhar et al., 1982) has led {{to a wide range of}} applications for crops and natural vegetation. For example, d 13 C data are used to study plant water use efficiency (Hobbie and Colpaert, 2004; Cernusak et al., 2008; Seibt et al., 2008) and respiration and secondary fractionation processes (Ghashghaie et al. ...|$|R
