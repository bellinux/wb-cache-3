5|$|Horizontal jumps (long {{jump and}} triple jump) and all throws must be {{initiated}} behind a line. In {{the case of}} horizontal jumps, that line is a straight line perpendicular to the runway. In the case of throws, that line is an arc or a circle. Crossing the line while initiating the attempt invalidates the attempt—it becomes a foul. All landings must occur in a sector. For the jumps, that is a sand filled pit, for throws it is a defined sector. A throw landing on the line {{on the edge of}} sector is a foul (the inside edge of the line is the outside edge of the sector). Assuming a proper attempt, officials measure the distance from the closest landing point back to the line. The measuring tape is carefully straightened to the shortest distance between the point and the line. To accomplish this, the tape must be perfectly perpendicular to the take off line in jumps, or is pulled through the center point of the arc for throws. The officials at the landing end of the tape have the zero, while the officials at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> measure and record the length. Whenever a record (or potential record) occurs, that measurement is taken (again) with a steel tape, and observed by at least three officials (plus usually the meet referee). Steel tapes are easily bent and damaged, so are not used to measure everyday competitions. For major competitions, each competitor gets three tries. The top competitors (usually 8 or 9 depending on that competition's rules or the number of lanes on the track) gets three more tries. At that level of competition, the order of competitors for those final three attempts are set—so the competitor in first place {{at the end of the}} third round is last, while the last competitor to qualify goes first. Some meets rearrange the competition order again for the final round, so the final attempt is taken by the leader at that point. At other competitions, meet management may choose to limit all competitors to four or three attempts. Whatever the format, all competitors get an equal number of attempts.|$|E

Possibly, micro-cracks existed earlier, and the cracks on the surface were maybe formed earlier or later than in the bulk material. A visible crack in a heavily sheared surface is quite subjective, and possibly, the tool displacement at crack initiation, that was also used in the FE simulations, was misinterpreted by a few tenth of a millimetre. Still, this would unlikely change the stress triaxiality to the magnitude that the observed spread would vanish or a clear trend become visible.|$|R

50|$|Detonating cord (also called {{detonation}} cord, detacord, det. cord, detcord, primer cord or sun cord) is a thin, flexible {{plastic tube}} usually filled with pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN, pentrite). With the PETN exploding {{at a rate}} of approximately 6400 m/s, any common length of detonation cord appears to explode instantaneously. It is a high-speed fuse which explodes, rather than burns, and is suitable for detonating high explosives. The velocity of detonation is sufficient to use it for synchronising multiple charges to detonate almost simultaneously even if the charges are placed at different distances from the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>initiation.</b> It is used to reliably and inexpensively chain together multiple explosive charges.

The comparison of the upstream regions for these transcriptional start sites shows {{the presence of a}} completely conserved trinucleotide sequence around the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> transcription <b>initiation</b> and a completely conserved octanucleotide sequence about 22 nucleotides upstream of it. These sequences are only moderately homologous to putative promoter elements for stable RNA genes in the closely related archaebacterium Thermoproteus tenax (1), but they are very similar to corresponding sequences in the distantly related archaebacterium Methanococcus vannielii (2).

40|$|Synapsis is {{the process}} by which paired {{chromosome}} homologues closely associate in meiosis before crossover. In the synaptonemal complex (SC), axial elements of each homologue connect through molecules of SYCP 1 to the central element, which contains the proteins SYCE 1 and - 2. We have derived mice lacking SYCE 2 protein, producing males and females in which meiotic chromosomes align and axes form but do not synapse. Sex chromosomes are unaligned, not forming a sex body. Additionally, markers of DNA breakage and repair are retained on the axes, and crossover is impaired, culminating in both males and females failing to produce gametes. We show that SC formation can initiate at sites of SYCE 1 /SYCP 1 localization but that these <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> cannot be extended in the absence of SYCE 2. SC assembly is thus dependent on SYCP 1, SYCE 1, and SYCE 2. We provide a model to explain this based on protein-protein interaction...|$|R

5000|$|In music a {{time point}} or timepoint (point in time) is [...] "an instant, {{analogous}} to a geometrical point in space". Because {{it has no}} duration, it literally cannot be heard, {{but it may be}} used to represent [...] "the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> of a single pitch, the repetition of a pitch, or a pitch simultaneity", therefore the beginning of a sound, rather than its duration. It may also designate the release of a note or the point within a note at which something changes (such as dynamic level). Other terms often used in music theory and analysis are attack point and starting point. Milton Babbitt calls the distance from one time point, attack, or starting point to the next a time-point interval, independent of the durations of the sounding notes which may be either shorter than the time-point interval (resulting in a silence before the next time point), or longer (resulting in overlapping notes). Charles Wuorinen shortens this expression to just time interval. Other writers use the terms attack interval, or (translating the German [...] "Einsatzabstand"), interval of entry, interval of entrance, or starting interval.|$|E

Approval of targeted and biological products corresponded with technological maturation, with first approval averaging 14 years after the established point and 44 years after initiation of associated technologies.

Efforts have mainly focussed on our ability to estimate the extent of damage induced by an explosive charge beyond an excavation boundary such as a final pit wall or beyond a tunnel or stope perimeter. This paper describes the latest developments of the Hybrid Stress Blasting Model (HSBM) and demonstrates the ability of the code to predict the three dimensional extent and shape of the damage zone from fully coupled explosive charges. Data obtained from controlled experiments and modelling results reported in this paper indicate that the zone of damage can be influenced by the <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> the explosive charge, its length and proximity to free face boundaries. Simple simulations of the potential damage envelopes from large diameter blastholes applying single and dual priming initiation are performed. The simulations included both confined and unconfined free faced conditions. Results show that the three dimensional damage envelopes are influenced by the direction of propagation and subsequent interaction of stress waves between initiation points. For example, the extent of surface damage from single toe initiation extends further behind the blasthole and this can be explained by a stress propagation broadening effect due to the close impedance matching between the explosive andthe simulated rock mass. Under similar conditions, when a mid and toe primer are fired simultaneously, the charge is dynamically split and the interaction between the two shorter detonation fronts causes an increase in the damage zone between these two primers. Further work is required to fully quantify the degree of damage within the predicted envelopes, in particular with regards to potential impacts on intact rock material properties, existing is continuities and overall weakening effects of the rock mass...|$|R

The model supported action potentials that shortened as they propagated away from the site of initiation and this was found to be largely independent of potassium channel inactivation.

The humanized EGFR-specific monoclonal antibody EMD 72000 has shown potent inhibitory activity in preclinical experiments and is under investigation in clinical studies. Using the human L 3. 6 pl pancreatic cancer cell line, we investigated whether the efficacy of EMD 72000 can be enhanced in combination with gemcitabine. Nude mice were orthotopically injected with L 3. 6 pl cells followed by biweekly treatment of 40 mg/kg EMD 72000 and 100 mg/kg gemcitabine (either alone or in combination). Under two treatment schedules we evaluated a) the influence <b>of</b> different time <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> single agent and combined treatment after tumor cell injection into nude mice and b) the influence of different treatment durations. In the first experiment, treatment was initiated at four different time-points after tumor cell injection (days 8 - 28). Exposure to EMD 72000 or gemcitabine alone resulted in detectable tumor shrinkage and reduced lymph node and liver metastases, however, these effects were enhanced in the EMD 72000 plus gemcitabine groups. Furthermore, combination treatment as well as EMD 72000 monotherapy led to a significant reduction of microvessel density and tumor cell proliferation in primary pancreatic tumors following immunohistochemical analysis for CD 31 and Ki 67, respectively. Overall, the effects were strongest when treatment was initiated at early time points after tumor cell injection. In a second experimental set-up, treatment was initiated at day 8 after tumor cell injection in all cases and stopped at four different time-points (days 15 - 33). Interestingly, there was no significant difference in the average tumor weight of the groups treated for short versus longer time periods. The treatment was most effective when given shortly after tumor cell injection, whereas the duration of the treatment appeared less important in this model. In conclusion, in this model the anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activity of EMD 72000 in combination with gemcitabine was substantially more effective than either treatment alone...|$|R

The two elements of the U 2 promoter which are located in the 5 ' flanking region of the gene, the DSE and the PSE, are shown to be essential but not sufficient for stable complex formation. Two additional elements are required. The first is a short gene-internal sequence; the second is the nucleotide at the normal <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>initiation,</b> which must be a purine. If this nucleotide is changed to a pyrimidine the site of initiation is altered and, concomitantly, the transcription complex formed on the mutant template remains unstable.

Equations are derived describing the accumulation of radioactivity hnRNA during continuous labelling assuming that nascent hnRNAs are stable and that hnRNAs decay with first-order kinetics only after completion of transcription. The effects of the transient stability of nascent hnRNAs on the kinetics of hnRNA turnover can become important when the half-life of the hnRNA is shorter than the time to transcribe an hnRNA from the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> to the point of termination.
