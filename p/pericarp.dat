These pomes incorporate (five) carpels and their accessory tissues forming the apple's core, surrounded by structures from outside the botanical fruit, the receptacle or hypanthium.

5|$|Like {{almost all}} amazons, the Puerto Rican amazon is a herbivore. Its diet {{consists}} of flowers, fruits, leaves, bark and nectar {{obtained from the}} forest's canopy. The species has been recorded to consume more than 60 different materials, although its diet was historically more varied due to its larger range. Among the items it consumes are the <b>pericarp</b> of the seeds of sierra palm (Prestoea montana), tabonuco (Dacryodes excelsa), and negra lora (Matayba domingensis); the fruits of bejuco de rana (Marcgravia sintenisii), camasey (Miconia sintenisii), cupey de altura (Clusia gundlachii), and palo de cruz (Rheedia portoricensis); the flowers of bejuco de rana, achiotillo (Alchornea latifolia), and Piptocarpha tetrantha; the leaves and twigs of cupeillo (Clusia grisebachiana), laurel sabino (Magnolia splendens), caimitillo verde (Micropholis garciniaefolia), and Piptocarpha tetrantha; the bark of bejuco de rana, cupeillo, and cachimbo cumun (Psychotria berteriana); and the buds of cuaba (Inga vera). It normally selects the fruits positioned {{directly in front of}} its eyes, picking them one at a time with some rare exceptions. When feeding, it uses a foot to pick up the food. The amazon feeds in a slow, paused manner taking 8–60seconds to consume separate items.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the possibility of bioethanol production from an indigenous fruit waste - pericaps of dragon fruit, the efficacy of several pretreatment methods on enzymatic digestibility of <b>pericarps</b> were investigated. Following that, the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSaF) of pretreated <b>pericarps</b> to ethanol was conducted by using instant dry yeast. From our study, {{it was observed that}} the total sugar yields obtained after enzymatic hydrolysis of thermally pretreated <b>pericarps</b> (0. 6 g/g) were higher than untreated <b>pericarps</b> powders (0. 28 g/g). By using thermally pretreated <b>pericarps</b> as biomass resource, ethanol concentration of 1. 5 g/L was achieved after 80 h of cultivation process. The ethanol yield of 27 % (% w/w initial dry weight of biomass) as recorded from the present study is lower compared to the theoretical yield of ethanol from pure glucose solution (51 % w/w glucose). Nevertheless, these results indicate that by applying thermal pretreatment, the <b>pericarps</b> of dragon fruit could be considered as an economically viable lignocellulosic material for production of fermentable sugars related to bioethanol production...|$|R

The structures of the polymeric proanthocyanidins isolated from Litchi chinensis were characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) coupled with high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) analysis. The spectra obtained through MALDI-TOF MS analysis revealed that the dominant A-type procyanidin polymers occurred in each polymer length with one or more A-type linkages. The polymeric proanthocyanidins of litchi fruit stones exhibited longer polymer length than those of fruit <b>pericarps,</b> with polymerization degrees up to 20 and 11 for fruit stones and <b>pericarps,</b> respectively. After depolymerization with toluene-a-thiol, HPLC-ESI-MS analysis showed that epicatechin and A-type dimer were the major constituent units, and the mean polymerization degrees were 15. 4 and 5. 8 for polymeric proanthocyanidins of fruit stones and <b>pericarps,</b> respectively. The antioxidant properties investigated using DPPH, ABTS and FRAP methods showed that the higher polymerization degree of polymeric proanthocyanidins from litchi fruit stones exhibited higher antioxidant activities than those from litchi <b>pericarps.</b> (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

25|$|While yellow maizes {{derive their}} color from lutein and zeaxanthin, in red-colored maizes, the kernel {{coloration}} {{is due to}} anthocyanins and phlobaphenes. These latter substances are synthesized in the flavonoids synthetic pathway from polymerisation of flavan-4-ols by the expression of maize <b>pericarp</b> color1 (p1) gene which encodes an R2R3 myb-like transcriptional activator of the A1 gene encoding for the dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (reducing dihydroflavonols into flavan-4-ols) while another gene (Suppressor of <b>Pericarp</b> Pigmentation 1 or SPP1) acts as a suppressor. The p1 gene encodes an Myb-homologous transcriptional activator of genes required for biosynthesis of red phlobaphene pigments, while the P1-wr allele specifies colorless kernel <b>pericarp</b> and red cobs, and unstable factor for orange1 (Ufo1) modifies P1-wr expression to confer pigmentation in kernel <b>pericarp,</b> as well as vegetative tissues, which normally do not accumulate significant amounts of phlobaphene pigments.

25|$|As the ovules {{develop into}} seeds, the ovary begins to ripen and the ovary wall, the <b>pericarp,</b> may become fleshy (as in berries or drupes), or form a hard outer {{covering}} (as in nuts). In some multiseeded fruits, {{the extent to}} which the flesh develops is proportional to the number of fertilized ovules. The <b>pericarp</b> is often differentiated into two or three distinct layers called the exocarp (outer layer, also called epicarp), mesocarp (middle layer), and endocarp (inner layer). In some fruits, especially simple fruits derived from an inferior ovary, other parts of the flower (such as the floral tube, including the petals, sepals, and stamens), fuse with the ovary and ripen with it. In other cases, the sepals, petals and/or stamens and style of the flower fall off. When such other floral parts are a significant part of the fruit, it is called an accessory fruit.

Total phenolic contents of the seeds and <b>pericarps</b> of the tropical fruits ranged from 104. 60 to 501. 95 mg/g DW. All extracts were found to have significant antioxidant activities.

Staining with annexin V-FITC/PI showed that this apoptosis occurred early in this cell type with 10. 0 % of the cells undergoing apoptosis. Tamarind seed extract might have potential anticancer activity which could be attributed, in part, to selectively inhibit the growth of CLS- 354 cells and induce apoptosis.

40|$|The candystripe {{variety of}} Sorghum bicolor {{displays}} a variegated pattern of red pigmented tissues in the <b>pericarps,</b> leaves, and stigmas. My dissertation encompasses different studies which are linked {{by a common}} theme [...] the investigation of transposable elements in sorghum. This work {{can be divided into}} three parts: a genetic characterization of the candystripe transposable element of sorghum, a molecular genetic study of two transposable elements cloned from sorghum, and a study of sorghum development utilizing the candystripe transposable element. In the first part of my study, I characterized the candystripe transposable element system and pigmentation genes involved in the candystripe phenotype. The variegated pattern appears to be caused by a transposable element inserted into the sorghum Y gene, producing an unstable allele, y-cs. I also found that the y-cs allele controls the pigmentation of the <b>pericarps,</b> leaves, and stigmas of candystripe sorghum plants. In the second part of my study, I molecularly isolated a putative transposable element from candystripe sorghum. This element is a homologue of the maize Activator transposable element family. This sorghum Activator homologue shares the consensus sequence for the 11 bp terminal inverted repeats of Activator elements, and also has 8 bp direct repeats. This homologue has a large deletion within the coding region of the transposase, and {{it appears to be a}} non-autonomous element similar to Ds. This region of Activator homology is adjacent to another region that appears to be an element with 150 nucleotide terminal inverted repeats, and appears to be similar to MITEs such as the Tourist element. The third part of my study was an investigation of sorghum vegetative and floral development utilizing the clonally-derived sectors of red tissue produced by the reversion of the y-cs allele. Through clonal analysis, I have determined that there is little compartmentalization of cell lineages in the sorghum apical meristem. The somatic tissues of the sorghum inflorescence and the vegetative structures share closely related cell lineages. However, the cell lineages of the gametophytic tissues of the inflorescence diverge from that of the somatic tissues of the <b>pericarps</b> early in the development of the panicle, and before the divergence of the <b>pericarps</b> and leaves.
