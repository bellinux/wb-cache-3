The names of the TSF and TSF-W are actually derived from the German term [...] "Tragkraftspritze" [...] which roughly translates into [...] "portable self powered pump". Those vehicles are crewed by a German Staffel (0/1/5/6), but the TSF and the TSF-W types provide enough equipment for a group (0/1/8/9).|$|E
40|$|The noise affects {{to working}} quality {{at the same}} degree as those to {{workforce}} and people health, therefore, appropriate noise control is indispensable. This study is aimed at evaluating of rockwool (5 cm) absorption coefficient and analyzing its effectivity on noise control. The room for simulation is equipped with known noise source. In this case a sound system instrument and <b>portable</b> <b>fire</b> <b>pump</b> were used. The tested noise frequencies were {{in the range of}} human hearing threshold for which an equalizer instrument was used to identify the sound frequencies. Based on this study, the rockwool absorption coefficients were 0. 8, 0. 96, 0. 98, 0. 82 for sound frequency of 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz and 4000 Hz respectively. By installing the rockwool on 37. 97 % of room area of 72 m 2, this rockwool was able to reduce the noise intensity by 10. 16 dBA, 10. 75 dBA, 10. 5 dBA, 9. 58 dBA, 9. 25 dBA for frequency of 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, 4000 Hz and multiple frequencies respectively. The rockwool is an effective sound absorber in noise control owing to have high absorption coefficient (almost unity) and ease for installment...|$|E

5000|$|In 1947 Leon Wosika and Eric Balje set up {{a second}} design line and {{developed}} a centrifugal-flow system that was much more compact than Solar's previous designs. Originally known as the MPM-45, the unit was delivered as the [...] "Mars". The Navy purchased the Mars to power <b>portable</b> <b>fire</b> fighting <b>pumps</b> on ships and gave it the designation T41. In 1956 the Navy turned to Solar to provide a slightly larger design to power a small helicopter, the Gyrodyne XRON-1. Solar Aircraft Company responded by developing a slightly larger version of the Mars, the [...] "Titan", which the Navy designated the T62. When the Navy abandoned development of Gyrodyne's XRON helicopter, Solar Aircraft Company adapted the Titan for service as an auxiliary power unit. Deliveries of this auxiliary power unit started in 1962. The Navy also had Solar adapt the Titan into a free-turbine version designated by the Navy as the T66, but this unit was never put into use. Solar Aircraft Company designed other versions of the basic Mars design, including the [...] Spartan, and the [...] Gemini.sdwIn the late 1950s, the Navy once again turned to Solar, this time for a larger [...] unit {{that would be used}} as an engine in a high-speed boat. The result was the axial-flow [...] "Saturn" [...] engine, which entered production in 1960. Solar started marketing the Saturn to industrial users needing a [...] unit for any role, and it {{went on to become the}} world's most widely used industrial gas turbine with some 4800 units in 80 countries. It remains in production today in two uprated and enhanced configurations. In order to make the system more attractive, Solar also started the design of various [...] "front ends" [...] that could be purchased as a complete unit with the Saturn. These included gas compressor sets, pump-drive packages and generator sets. These units, especially the gas compressors, are widely used in the natural gas industry as pumping units on pipelines.|$|R

5000|$|A jockey pump is a pump {{connected}} to a fire sprinkler system and is intended to maintain pressure in a fire protection piping system to an artificially high level so that the operation of a single fire sprinkler will cause a pressure drop which will be sensed by the <b>fire</b> <b>pump</b> automatic controller, causing the <b>fire</b> <b>pump</b> to start.
