40|$|Abstract. <b>Process</b> <b>maps</b> {{provide a}} {{holistic}} view of all processes {{of an organization}} by visualizing their essential relationships. The design of a <b>process</b> <b>map</b> is of central importance as many organizations create them {{at the start of}} a business process management (BPM) initiative to serve as a framework. Despite this importance, the design of <b>process</b> <b>maps</b> is still more art than science, essentially because there is no standardized modeling language available for <b>process</b> <b>map</b> design. In this paper, we address the research question of which concepts are currently used in <b>process</b> <b>maps</b> and how they are related to each other. To this end, we investigate 67 <b>process</b> <b>maps.</b> Our contribution is a meta-model for <b>process</b> <b>map</b> design which is grounded in actual usage. Furthermore, we discuss the importance of different concepts for <b>process</b> <b>map</b> design...|$|R
40|$|Background A <b>process</b> <b>map</b> is {{a diagram}} showing the {{sequential}} steps and decisions used {{to accomplish a}} procedure from start to finish. <b>Process</b> <b>maps</b> are a standard tool in continuous improvement efforts. They have not been used routinely in clinical trials although they are well suited to display trial processes. Purpose We present the use of <b>process</b> <b>maps</b> {{as a tool to}} visualize and to monitor the correctness of trial work flows. We show that <b>process</b> <b>maps</b> can be used to assure that trial processes are conducted according to the SOP. Methods We describe how a <b>process</b> <b>map</b> is made. We then derive <b>process</b> <b>maps</b> from two sources: the SOP and trial procedures as currently implemented. We compare these maps to each other, using the SOP maps as the gold standard, to check that work is done according to the written procedures. Results Eight <b>process</b> <b>maps</b> were produced from each source. 172 {{differences were found between the}} SOP maps and the walkthrough maps. Differences included the addition of extra steps, order errors, step mistakes, and ambiguities. Limitations These <b>process</b> <b>maps</b> focused only on clinic procedures, so interactions with other trial components were not considered. The maps were made after the trial started, which may have biased their content and use. Conclusion <b>Process</b> <b>maps</b> are a simple tool to check if clinical trial processes are operating as designed and offer an effective means to identify and correct such divergences. Further research should focus on using processmaps in the design phase of trials, analyzing the cost to benefit ratio for processmaps, and linking the analysis of the <b>process</b> <b>map</b> to monitor queries to quantify the improvement gained from using this technique.

40|$|The {{construction}} industry has witnessed serious {{efforts in the}} last few years through the consideration of the adoption of new procurement systems and production/manufacturing philosophies. However, <b>process</b> <b>maps</b> which can help organisations <b>map</b> their <b>processes</b> into some meaningful structure are still lacking. The product (building) is still the main focus in construction. In the manufacturing industry, most large organisations have <b>process</b> <b>maps</b> which can assist them in ensuring the delivery of products on time, within budget and to the right quality while capturing the best process practices. In construction, there had been some efforts to devise <b>process</b> <b>maps</b> such as the RIBA plan of work in the UK. This paper presents a <b>process</b> <b>map</b> based on principles used in the manufacturing industry. Knowledge was elicited from experts through a series of workshops and case studies. The results of some of these case studies, which have been used to assess the practicality of implementing this <b>process</b> <b>map</b> on real life projects, are presented. Finally, the IT required to support and enable the effective implementation of the <b>process</b> <b>map</b> is briefly described...|$|R

40|$|Background The Scottish Patient Safety Programme – Pharmacy in Primary Care {{collaborative}} {{has developed}} High Risk Medicine (HRM) Care Bundles (CB). These CBs, which are interventions that improve care processes and outcomes, focus on clinical assessment and patient education. Using quality improvement methods, {{these have been}} implemented in 28 community pharmacies in four health service regions – two focus on Warfarin and two on non-steroidal anti-inflammatories. The intent is for national roll out of a HRM CB, where a standardised process may act as a platform to accelerate uptake of pharmacoepidemiology findings into routine practice. Objective To develop a generic HRM CB <b>process</b> <b>map</b> to facilitate implementation. Methods Regional <b>process</b> <b>maps</b> were developed through data collection in four pharmacies, involving simulation of the CB process, staff interviews and documentation of resources. Following validation by the onsite pharmacist, commonalities among the <b>process</b> <b>maps</b> were collated to create a <b>process</b> <b>map</b> for each HRM. To develop a generic HRM <b>process</b> <b>map,</b> these were validated by 93 % (n= 26) of participating pharmacies. Consent was gained throughout. Ethical approval was not sought as this was service evaluation. Results Although some regional variation existed, the validation identified six core stages required for successful CB delivery: patient identification, clinical assessment, patients’ eligibility flagged, CB delivery, enrolling non-attending patients and documentation. The commonalities were sufficient to develop a generic <b>process</b> <b>map</b> encompassing staff and patients' journey, its integration into usual practice and resources utilised. Conclusion To maximise implementation success, the <b>process</b> <b>map</b> allows for targeted development of resources to facilitate each core stage. The feasibility of developing a generic <b>process</b> <b>map</b> suggests adaptability of the CB to varying clinical contexts, strengthening the CBs potential to facilitate national implementation of health informatics research. Safety concerns highlighted by pharmacoepidemiology studies could be addressed by adapting the CBs' content, allowing seamless translation of evidence into practice...|$|R
40|$|Business Process Management (BPM) {{is often}} adopted by {{organizations}} {{as a method}} to increase awareness and knowledge of their business processes. Business process modeling {{is used as a}} method to represent business processes in form of business process models. The number of organizations adopting BPM is quickly increasing. By this means, so is the number of business process models as result of a BPM initiative. Within a single organization the number of business process models often ranges from hundreds to even thousands. In order to handle such large amount of business process models, organizations structure them by the help of a process architecture. It includes a <b>process</b> <b>map,</b> which is considered as the top-most view of the process architecture where the organization's business processes and the relations between them are visually and abstractly depicted. The details of each business process shown on the <b>process</b> <b>map</b> are stored in the lower levels of the corresponding process architecture. The purpose of a <b>process</b> <b>map</b> is to provide an overview of how an organization operates as a whole without necessarily going into the process details. Therefore, the design of a <b>process</b> <b>map</b> is vital not only for the understanding of the company's processes, but also for the subsequent detailed process modeling. This is primarily because, a <b>process</b> <b>map</b> is often the result of the process identification phase of the BPM lifecycle, and is used as a foundation for the subsequent phases, where the detailed process modeling and process improvement takes place. Despite their importance, the design of <b>process</b> <b>maps</b> is still more art than science, essentially because there is no standardized modeling language available for <b>process</b> <b>map</b> design. As a result, we are faced with a high heterogeneity of <b>process</b> <b>map</b> designs from practice, although they all serve a similar purpose. This has accordingly been our main motivation for pursuing the research presented in this thesis. The research question for this thesis is the following: How to effectively model processes on an abstract level? In this thesis, we document the development of a language for designing <b>process</b> <b>maps.</b> In particular, we provide the following contributions. First, we present a holistic reference BPM framework. It is a consolidation of procedural frameworks introduced by prominent BPM researchers. The framework includes eleven BPM elements, each holding activities organizations need to consider when adopting BPM. Second, we provide a method for assessing cognitive effectiveness of <b>process</b> <b>maps</b> used in practice. For this, we follow the nine principles for cognitively effective visual notations introduced by Moody citemoody 2012 physics. In addition, we employ the cognitive fit theory to check whether the design of <b>process</b> <b>maps</b> has an effect on the BPM success in the respective organization. Second, we conduct a systematic literature review on the quality of modeling languages and models. We use the quality requirements we found as basis for developing the language for designing <b>process</b> <b>maps.</b> Third, we define the abstract syntax, semantics, and concrete syntax of the language for <b>process</b> <b>maps.</b> We follow an explorative method, hence we rely on empirical data for the language development. Accordingly, we reuse symbols in our language which have already been used in practice as part of <b>process</b> <b>maps.</b> We follow this approach in order to ensure the language will consist of elements already familiar to organizations. We evaluate the language by means of an experiment, in which we assess the effectiveness and efficiency of <b>process</b> <b>maps</b> designed using elements from our language against <b>process</b> <b>maps</b> that have not been designed using our language. Last, this thesis provides a method for testing the suitability of existing languages for specific purposes. (author's abstract...|$|R

40|$|As {{healthcare}} becomes information intensive technology increasingly {{plays an}} important role in managing patient care; information gathering and dissemination; and co-ordinating work.

40|$|Objective: The Scottish Patient Safety Programme – Pharmacy in Primary Care {{collaborative}} is {{a quality}} improvement initiative adopting the Institute of Healthcare Improvement Breakthrough Series collaborative approach. The programme developed and piloted High Risk Medicine (HRM) Care Bundles (CB), focused on warfarin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), within 27 community pharmacies over 4 NHS Regions. Each CB involves clinical assessment and patient education, although the CB content varies between regions. To support national implementation, {{this study aims}} {{to understand how the}} pilot pharmacies integrated the HRM CBs into routine practice to inform the development of a generic HRM CB <b>process</b> <b>map.</b> Methods: Regional <b>process</b> <b>maps</b> were developed in 4 pharmacies through simulation of the CB process, staff interviews and documentation of resources. Commonalities were collated to develop a <b>process</b> <b>map</b> for each HRM, which were used to explore variation at a national event. A single, generic <b>process</b> <b>map</b> was developed which underwent validation by case study testing. Results: The findings allowed development of a generic <b>process</b> <b>map</b> applicable to warfarin and NSAID CB implementation. Five steps were identified as required for successful CB delivery: patient identification; clinical assessment; pharmacy CB prompt; CB delivery; and documentation. The generic HRM CB <b>process</b> <b>map</b> encompasses the staff and patients' journey and the CB's integration into routine community pharmacy practice. Pharmacist involvement was required only for clinical assessment, indicating suitability for whole-team involvement. Conclusions: Understanding CB integration into routine practice has positive implications for successful implementation. The generic <b>process</b> <b>map</b> can be used to develop targeted resources, and/or be disseminated to facilitate CB delivery and foster whole team involvement. Similar methods could be utilised within other settings, to allow those developing novel services to distil the key processes and consider their integration within routine workflows to effect maximal, efficient implementation and benefit to patient care...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis was to define the {{manufacturing}} process of a camera application with included optics and its integration with electronics and verify the process information by Volvo Car Corporation’s (VCC’s) cost model and using it to calculate the total product cost. The method used to fulfill the purpose was divided into three phases, understanding the product, creating <b>process</b> <b>maps</b> and performing a cost calculation. By the use of literature studies, observations and interviews, necessary data needed to perform a cost calculation was included in specific <b>process</b> <b>maps.</b> The data was then used as input for VCC’s cost model to calculate the total product cost. By analyzing gathered information using the methods described above, three specific <b>process</b> <b>maps</b> with necessary data were created. These were a <b>process</b> <b>map</b> of lens manufacturing, a <b>process</b> <b>map</b> of lens barrel assembly and a <b>process</b> <b>map</b> of final assembly. When calculating the cost of all the components, {{the cost of the}} lenses was estimated using the specific lens manufacturing process. After calculating the cost of all the ingoing components, the cost of the lens barrel assembly was calculated. This cost was then used to calculate the cost of the final assembly with all ingoing components. The results showed that the total product cost was 72 €, the cost distribution showed that the lenses were the most expensive component constituting for approximately 72 % of the total product cost. When presenting information about the cost distribution of each process within lens manufacturing, it could be seen that the polishing process was the most costly operation of all. Due to lenses being the most expensive component in the product, it was recommended to do further research within optical manufacturing and to review the product requirements and specification regarding the optical system {{in order to reduce the}} total product cost...|$|R
