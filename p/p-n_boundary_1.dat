40|$|Recent {{experimental}} work on locally gated graphene layers resulting in p-n junctions have revealed quantum Hall effect in their transport behavior. We explain the observed conductance quantization which is fractional in the bipolar regime and integer in the unipolar regime {{in terms of}} quantum Hall edge modes propagating along and across the p-n interface. In the bipolar regime the electron and hole modes can mix at the <b>p-n</b> <b>boundary,</b> leading to current partition and quantized shot noise plateaus {{similar to those of}} conductance, while in the unipolar regime transport is noiseless. These quantum Hall phenomena reflect the massless Dirac character of charge carriers in graphene, with particle-hole interplay manifest in mode mixing and noise in the bipolar regime.

50|$|Detector {{and power}} {{rectifiers}} could not amplify a signal. Many {{efforts were made}} to develop a solid-state amplifier, but these were unsuccessful because of limited theoretical understanding of semiconductor materials. In 1922 Oleg Losev developed two-terminal, negative resistance amplifiers for radio; however, he perished in the Siege of Leningrad. In 1926 Julius Edgar Lilienfeld patented a device resembling a modern field-effect transistor, but it was not practical. R. Hilsch and R. W. Pohl in 1938 demonstrated a solid-state amplifier using a structure resembling the control grid of a vacuum tube; although the device displayed power gain, it had a cut-off frequency of one cycle per second, too low for any practical applications, but an effective application of the available theory. At Bell Labs, William Shockley and A. Holden started investigating solid-state amplifiers in 1938. The first p-n junction in silicon was observed by Russell Ohl about 1941, when a specimen was found to be light-sensitive, with a sharp boundary between p-type impurity at one end and n-type at the other. A slice cut from the specimen at the <b>p-n</b> <b>boundary</b> developed a voltage when exposed to light.|$|R

These facts follow from the fact that every homologically trivial 1 -chain C in S rationally cobounds an immersed surface with a sufficiently large multiple of ∂S. This is true even if S has no <b>boundary.</b> <b>1...</b>|$|R
