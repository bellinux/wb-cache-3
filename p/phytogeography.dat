5|$|Augustin Pyramus de Candolle also spelled Augustin Pyrame de Candolle (4 February 1778 – 9 September 1841) was a Swiss botanist. René Louiche Desfontaines {{launched}} de Candolle's botanical {{career by}} recommending him at an herbarium. Within {{a couple of}} years de Candolle had established a new genus, and he went on to document hundreds of plant families and create a new natural plant classification system. Although de Candolle's main focus was botany, he also contributed to related fields such as <b>phytogeography,</b> agronomy, paleontology, medical botany, and economic botany.|$|E

25|$|Heinrich Gustav Adolf Engler (25 March 1844 – 10 October 1930) was a German botanist. He {{is notable}} {{for his work}} on plant {{taxonomy}} and <b>phytogeography,</b> such as Die natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien (The Natural Plant Families), edited with Karl A. E. von Prantl.|$|E
25|$|He {{founded the}} journal Botanische Jahrbücher für Systematik, Pflanzengeschichte und Pflanzengeographie (Botanical Yearbook for Systematics, Plant Phylogeny and <b>Phytogeography,</b> ISSN 0006-8152), {{published}} in Leipzig, Germany, which has continued in publication from 1881 to the present.

It is significant for its contributions to plant systematics, and to African floristics and <b>phytogeography.</b>|$|E
500|$|... de Candolle {{spent the}} rest of his life in an attempt to {{elaborate}} and complete his natural system of botanical classification. de Candolle published initial work in his Regni vegetabillis systema naturale, but after two volumes he realized he could not complete the project on such a large scale. Consequently, he began his less extensive Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis in 1824. However, he was able to finish only seven volumes, or two-thirds of the whole. Even so, he was able to characterize over one hundred families of plants, helping to lay the empirical basis of general botany. Although de Candolle's main focus was botany, throughout his career he also dabbled in fields related to botany, such as <b>phytogeography,</b> agronomy, paleontology, medical botany, and economic botany.|$|E
500|$|Croatia can be {{subdivided}} {{between a}} number of ecoregions because of its climate and geomorphology, {{and the country is}} consequently one of the richest in Europe in terms of biodiversity. There are four types of biogeographical regions in Croatia: Mediterranean along the coast and in its immediate hinterland, Alpine in most of Lika and Gorski Kotar, Pannonian along the Drava and Danube, and continental in the remaining areas. Among the most significant are karst habitats; these include submerged karst, such as Zrmanja and Krka canyons and tufa barriers, as well as underground habitats. The karst geology has produced approximately 7,000 caves and pits, many of which are inhabited by troglobitic (exclusively cave-dwelling) animals such as the olm, a cave salamander and the only European troglobitic vertebrate. Forests are also significant in the country, as they cover [...] representing 46.8% of Croatia's land surface. The other habitat types include wetlands, grasslands, bogs, fens, scrub habitats, coastal and marine habitats. In terms of <b>phytogeography,</b> Croatia is part of the Boreal Kingdom; specifically, {{it is part of the}} Illyrian and Central European provinces of the Circumboreal Region and the Adriatic province of the Mediterranean Region. The World Wide Fund for Nature divides land in Croatia into three ecoregions—Pannonian mixed forests, Dinaric Mountains mixed forests and Illyrian deciduous forests. Biomes in Croatia include temperate broadleaf/mixed forest and Mediterranean forests, woodlands and scrub; all are in the Palearctic ecozone.|$|E
2500|$|Alongside his {{teachers}} Nicolás Angulo Espino and Arnaldo López Miranda, which he greatly admired (he {{named after the}} later a genus and the journal he founded) and constantly referred to both in daily life and teachings, he is [...] {{thought of as a}} pioneer of botany in Northern Peru. He considered fieldwork to be a major component of botanical research, and all his manuals, such as Fitogeografía General y del Perú ("General and Peruvian Phytogeography", six editions), were based on extensive fieldwork. All that fieldwork amounted to some 18 000 specimens distributed in Peruvian and American herbaria (mostly the Herbarium Antenor Orrego and the Herbarium Truxillense). He worked in multiple areas of botany, not only systematics, but also <b>phytogeography,</b> floristics and plant morphology.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phytogeography</b> {{is often}} {{divided into two}} main branches: {{ecological}} <b>phytogeography</b> and historical <b>phytogeography.</b> The former investigates the role of current day biotic and abiotic interactions in influencing plant distributions; the latter are concerned with historical reconstruction of the origin, dispersal, and extinction of taxa.|$|E
