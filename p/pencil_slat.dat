25|$|Kollam is {{the largest}} <b>pencil</b> <b>slat</b> {{manufacturing}} hub in India. There are more than 150 slat production units in the city employing roughly 5,000 persons. A {{good portion of the}} demand for pencil slats in the country is met by these units. 35% of the world's pencil slats are manufactured in Kerala. Of the 170 odd <b>pencil</b> <b>slat</b> manufacturing units in Kerala, 125 are based in and around Kollam district. These units export 160 loads of slats per month to companies across the world. This, according to slat manufacturers, is enough to make 200 million pencils per month. A slat is of 185mm length, 77mm width and 5.5mm thickness. Each load exported contains 300 bags with 900 slats bundled into each. On an average each month 150 loads of pencil slats are shipped to pencil factories based in Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai and various places in Gujarat. Over 30 countries depend on Kollam's <b>pencil</b> <b>slat</b> manufacturers for pencil making under different brand names. These factories are working with the support of their associations: the Kerala Slats Factories Association and the Kerala State Small Industries Association (KSSIA). Most of the important employees of these associations are from Kollam.|$|E

40|$|Jelutung wood (Dyera spp ­ Apocynaceae) {{has been}} {{the main source of}} <b>pencil</b> <b>slat</b> in Indonesia for more than 30 years. It can easily be peeled with pencil {{sharpener}} specially designed for children USAge. However the supply of jelutung wood is no longer sufficient to meet the rising demand for <b>pencil</b> <b>slat.</b> It is therefore necessary to search for substitute. Previous study with jelutung and other wood species indicated that the peelability of wood depend not only on wood density but also on anatomical structure. The occurrence of closely spaced parenchyma lines in jelutung enhances the ease of wood to be peeled. The closely spaced parenchyma lines acted as if they were chopped lines inside the wood tissue that made the wood peelable. So the prospective substitute should have similar parenchyma pattern with jelutung 2 ̆ 7 s. Nyatoh (Palaquium spp. ­ Sapotaceae) is known to have closely spaced parenchyma bands similar to that of jelutung 2 ̆ 7 s. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to find out whether or not nyatoh wood could be used for <b>pencil</b> <b>slat,</b> as a substitute for jelutung wood in pencil production. Sample of nyatoh wood (Palaquium obtusifolium Burck.) used in this experiment was obtained from Sulawesi. The sample was processed into pencil at PT Staedtler Indonesian factory in Serang, using 28 grade graphite lead. The peelability test were assisted by primary school student class II, llI, and IV, using simple rotary pencil sharpener. Pencils made of jelutung were used as controls. An independent test was used to analyze whether or not nyatoh wood is easy to be peeled, and whether or not the pee/ability depend on the age of the student and on the wood species used. The anatomical structure and the density of the wood sample were also observed. The result of experiment indicated that nyatoh wood with sample density ranges from 0. 40 ­ 0. 57 gr/cm 3 was easily peeled with pencil sharpener, either by primary school student class IV, and by class II as well. Further test also indicated that nyatoh had the same peelability with jelutung wood. So it is possible to use nyatoh wood as jelutung substitute in pencil production. Moreover, the colour of nyatoh is already reddish brown so it does not need staining with colour substance as usually being done to jelutung...|$|E

The District of Quilon (Kollam)in State of Kerala produce nearly 75 to 100 Truck Loads of <b>Pencil</b> <b>Slats.</b> Though this wood {{is not as}} good as Cedar, Geluthong, Linden for making Pencils, Indian Pencil Industry survive on this wood.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this project is to propose an intercontinental transport system for selected commodities from/to main destinations {{within the scope of}} business relations in a particular company, while speacial attention is paid to a detailed comparison of different logistic fields and their combination. Particularly the project deals with the import of <b>pencil</b> <b>slats</b> from China and there are three forms of transport compared by sea, railway and air. There where asked six respondents. The results show an intense competitive environment in this field. The individual forms of transport are considered especially in terms of expenses, time and also impact on environment...|$|R
