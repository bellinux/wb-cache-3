40|$|In {{order to}} define the effect of {{nutrient}} enrichment on trophic webs in an Andean mountain stream we performed an experiment using stable isotope ratios (δ 15 N and δ 13 C) to analyze different trophic compartments: 1) basal level: CPOM and biofilm; 2) <b>primary</b> <b>consumers</b> - macroinvertebrates: collector-gatherers (Heterelmis sp., Thraulodes sp. and Trichorythodes sp.), and collectorfilterers (Simulium sp.); 3) predators - fish (Oncorhynchus mykiss and Trichomycterus bogotensis). The average fractionation of nitrogen among the <b>primary</b> <b>consumers</b> with respect to CPOM was 4. 7, and 1. 7 with respect to biofilm.

40|$|Stable isotope {{analysis}} {{has been used}} to examine marine food webs since the 1980 s and has become a valuable tool for studying carbon sources and trophic structures in benthic food chains in the Arctic. Prior to the present study, no one has used stabile isotope analysis to test for a difference in the main carbon source or trophic structure along a depth gradient in the Arctic. Carbon sources (pelagic POM, sediment POM and macroalgae) and consumers (benthic filter feeders, deposit feeders, grazers, scavengers and predators and grazing zooplankton) were collected from Isfjorden, Svalbard, at depths ranging from 0 – 400 m. There was a big overlap in both δ 13 C and δ 15 N for most of the carbon sources sampled, making it difficult to identify one single food source to any of the depths. Most benthic <b>primary</b> <b>consumers</b> (filter-feeding bivalves and grazers) were enriched in δ 13 C relative to pelagic POM, sediment POM and the brown algae Chorda filum at all depths. Most <b>primary</b> <b>consumers</b> fell in between the fractionation rates of the two groups of brown algae (filter-feeding bivalves), or were enriched in δ 13 C relative to the isotopically lightest carbon source sampled in this study (grazers). This suggests that a) a mixture of multiple carbon sources constitute the diets of most <b>primary</b> <b>consumers,</b> and possibly the entire benthic food web, and b) the benthic <b>primary</b> <b>consumers</b> utilize one or more carbon sources not sampled in this study. The δ 15 N among <b>primary</b> <b>consumers</b> varied somewhat between stations, but this was not reflected higher up in the food chain. The biggest difference in δ 15 N was found for the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus sp., which is likely caused by different feeding strategies among specimens inhabiting shallow and deep waters...|$|R

50|$|Solar {{energy is}} fixed by the photoautotrophs, called primary producers, like green plants. <b>Primary</b> <b>consumers</b> absorb {{most of the}} stored energy in the plant through digestion, and {{transform}} it into the form of energy they need, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), through respiration. A part of the energy received by <b>primary</b> <b>consumers,</b> herbivores, is converted to body heat (an effect of respiration), which is radiated away and lost from the system. The loss of energy through body heat is far greater in warm-blooded animals, which must eat much more frequently than those that are cold-blooded. Energy loss also occurs in the expulsion of undigested food (egesta) by excretion or regurgitation.|$|R
50|$|The mean {{trophic level}} is {{calculated}} by assigning each fish or invertebrate species a number {{based on its}} trophic level. The trophic level {{is a measure of}} the position of an organism in a food web, starting at level 1 with primary producers, such as phytoplankton and seaweed, then moving through the <b>primary</b> <b>consumers</b> at level 2 that eat the primary producers to the secondary consumers at level 3 that eat the <b>primary</b> <b>consumers,</b> and so on. In marine environments, trophic levels range from two to five for the apex predators. The mean trophic level can then be calculated for fishery catches by averaging trophic levels for the overall catch using the datasets for commercial fish landings.|$|R

40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that regime shifts occur at several scales in ecosystems (from the spatiotemporal alternation of two species to large-scale, ecosystem-level rearrangements). Yet, the theoretical background for understanding these changes {{is far from}} clear. Since fishing down in marine ecosystems is well-documented trend, and its top-down cascading effects in food webs have been richly documented, it is a current question whether overfishing, in general, can also influence regime shifts at lower levels. We model simple marine ecosystems by dynamical food webs and investigate the probability of regime shifts emerging among <b>primary</b> <b>consumers.</b> We considered cases where {{only one of the}} <b>primary</b> <b>consumers</b> is persistent in the stationary state. By perturbing the death rates in the food web, we studied the circumstances when the previously persistent primary producer is indirectly changed by the previously non-persistent one. Whether and how regime shifts (e. g., change in <b>primary</b> <b>consumers)</b> can occur depends on (1) food web topology (presence of top-predator and alternative producer), (2) the relative strength of perturbation of primary consumers’ death rates, and (3) the dynamical parameters of the recovering consumer. We found that overfishing, food web topology and dynamical parameters together determine the probability of regime shifts. Thus, integrative and complex models are needed in multispecies fisheries...|$|R
40|$|Resource {{subsidies}} {{increase the}} productivity of recipient food webs and can affect ecosystem dynamics. Subsidies of prey often support elevated predator biomass which may intensify top-down control and reduce the flow of reciprocal subsidies into adjacent ecosystems. However, top-down control in subsidized food webs may be limited if <b>primary</b> <b>consumers</b> posses morphological or behavioral traits that limit vulnerability to predation. In forested streams, terrestrial prey support high predator biomass creating the potential for strong top-down control, however armored <b>primary</b> <b>consumers</b> often dominate the invertebrate assemblage. Using empirically based simulation models, we tested the response of stream food webs to variations in subsidy magnitude, prey vulnerability, {{and the presence of}} two top predators. While terrestrial prey inputs increased predator biomass (+ 12 %), the presence of armored <b>primary</b> <b>consumers</b> inhibited top-down control, and diverted most aquatic energy (, 75 %) into the riparian forest through aquatic insect emergence. Food webs without armored invertebrates experienced strong trophic cascades, resulting in higher algal (, 50 %) and detrital (, 1600 %) biomass, and reduced insect emergence (290 %). These results suggest prey vulnerability can mediate food web responses to subsidies, and that top-down control can be arrested even when predator-invulnerable consumers are uncommon (20 %) regardless o...|$|R
