40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{international}} best practices of <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation and to establish the common valuation concept, awareness and application of valuation methodology and valuation process for <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation in Malaysia. Using a qualitative approach, the content analyses were conducted from the international practices and current Malaysian implementation of <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation. A quantitative approach, via questionnaire, was distributed amongst the registered and probationary valuers in Malaysia to investigate their understanding and opinion relating to <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation based on their current practices. The significance {{of this research is}} the identification of international <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery practices and the understanding of current practices of <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation in Malaysia. It found the main issues impacting on <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation practices in Malaysia are the limited numbers of resources available either from scholars or practitioners. This is supported by the findings from the research survey which indicates that there are immediate needs for practical notes or guidelines to be developed and implemented to support the Malaysian valuers practising <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation.

5|$|Farming in Egypt was {{dependent}} on the cycle of the Nile River. The Egyptians recognized three seasons: Akhet (flooding), Peret (<b>planting),</b> <b>and</b> Shemu (harvesting). The flooding season lasted from June to September, depositing on the river's banks a layer of mineral-rich silt ideal for growing crops. After the floodwaters had receded, the growing season lasted from October to February. Farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields, which were irrigated with ditches and canals. Egypt received little rainfall, so farmers relied on the Nile to water their crops. From March to May, farmers used sickles to harvest their crops, which were then threshed with a flail to separate the straw from the grain. Winnowing removed the chaff from the grain, and the grain was then ground into flour, brewed to make beer, or stored for later use.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} and discuss on the <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation syllabus for higher learning education in Malaysia to ensure the practicality of the subject in the real market.

Most papers highlighted the methodologies but limited papers discussed on the <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation education. This paper will determine inputs for <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation guidance focussing on the syllabus set up and references for valuers interested in this area of expertise. A qualitative approach via content analysis is conducted to compare international <b>and</b> Malaysian <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> machinery valuation syllabus and suggest improvements for Malaysian syllabus.

5|$|Modern plant breeders {{develop new}} crop {{varieties}} to meet specific conditions.

The practical use of crop diversity goes back to early agricultural methods of crop rotation and fallow fields, where <b>planting</b> <b>and</b> harvesting one type of crop on a plot of land one year, and planting a different crop on that same plot the next year. This takes advantage of differences in a plant's nutrient needs, but more importantly reduces the buildup of pathogens.|$|E

5|$|The Song {{government}} provided {{tax incentives}} to farmers who tilled lands {{along the edges}} of lakes, marshes, seas, and terraced mountain slopes. Farming was made possible in these difficult terrains due to improvements in damming techniques and using chain pumps to elevate water to higher irrigation planes. The 10th century introduction of early-ripening rice that could grow in varied climatic zones and topographic conditions allowed for a significantly large migration from the most productive lands that had been farmed for centuries into previously uninhabited areas in the surrounding hinterland of the Yangzi Valley and Southeast China, which experienced rapid development. The widespread cultivation of rice in China necessitated new trends of labor and agricultural techniques. An effective yield from rice paddies required careful transplanting of rows of rice seedlings, sufficient weeding, maintenance of water levels, and draining of fields for harvest. <b>Planting</b> <b>and</b> weeding often required a dirty day of work, since the farmers had to wade through the muddy water of the rice paddies on bare feet. For other crops, water buffalos were used as draft animals for ploughing and harrowing the fields, while properly aged and mixed compost and manure was constantly spread.|$|E
5|$|The {{legacy of}} the Auld Alliance, and the {{beginnings}} of the grand tour, meant that French styles were particularly important in Scotland, although adapted for the Scottish climate. From the late seventeenth century the gardens at Versailles, with their formal avenues, parterres and fountains that stressed symmetry and order, were a model. After the Glorious Revolution Dutch influences were also significant, with uniform <b>planting</b> <b>and</b> topiary. Gardening books from the continent and England became widely available in this period and the first gardening book published in Scotland, John Reid's, Scots Gard'ner (1683), borrowed from John Evelyn's (1658) translation of Nicholas de Bonnefon's Le Jardinair françois (1651), adapting its ideas for Scottish conditions. In the late seventeenth century William Bruce put Scotland at the forefront of European garden design, lowering garden walls to incorporate the surrounding countryside into the vista. This allowed a focus on significant landscape features such as Bass rock at Balcaskie and Loch Leven Castle at Kinross. Alexander Edward (1651–1708) continued in the tradition established by Bruce, adding landscapes at houses including Hamilton Palace and Kinnaird castle, Angus. Grand schemes in the French tradition included James Douglas, 2nd Duke of Queensberry (1662–1711) reworking of the terraces at Drumlanrig Castle, which incorporated the Douglas family crest into the parterres design, and the militaristic earthworks undertaken for Field Marshal John Dalrymple, 2nd Earl of Stair (1679–1747) at Castle Kennedy, Wigtownshire. Earl of Mar's (1675–1732) palace at Alloa was the grandest realisation of the Versailles style gardens in Scotland: it included canals, parterres, statues and ornamental trees.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Public {{libraries}} are {{an important}} resource for communities. Access to <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> animal books impacts a communities’ ability to learn about their environment. In this study, the number of <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> animal books available to people through local libraries in northern Kentucky, and neighboring counties in Ohio and Indiana were counted and a survey assessing one’s preferences and likeliness to participate in conservation activities was distributed to local residents. Based on the collected data, a statistically significant relationship (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) was found between access to <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> animal books available at local libraries {{and the likelihood of}} people to participate in conservation activities. Further analysis was performed between the total number of shelved <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> animal books at local libraries, the total number of shelved juvenile <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> animal books and the shelved adult <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> animal books, and the total number of <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> animal books in libraries compared to the local household income and number of households near a library. This study found that people that read books about <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> animals were more likely to participate in conservation activities associated with their book preference. This study also found that people living in low-income communities with fewer households are less likely to participate in <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> animal conservation, as compared to higher-income communities with a higher number of households. Additionally, this study found that lower income areas have fewer <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> animal books on the library shelves than higher income areas. Consequently, study results suggest that if more <b>plant</b> <b>and</b> animal books were made available to low-income areas and areas of biological importance through libraries, people {{may be more likely to}} conserve the wildlife around them...|$|R
