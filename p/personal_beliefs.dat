40|$|Policy The National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) urges that <b>personal</b> <b>belief</b> {{exemptions}} {{be removed}} from state immunization laws and regulations.

NACCHO supports the continued availability of medical exemptions and acknowledges existing religious exemptions to school immunization requirements in accordance with state laws.

5|$|Like other {{rulers of}} the period, Henry donated to the Church and patronised various {{religious}} communities, but contemporary chroniclers did not consider him an unusually pious king. His <b>personal</b> <b>beliefs</b> and piety may, however, have developed {{during the course of}} his life. Henry had always taken an interest in religion, but in his later years he may have become much more concerned about spiritual affairs. If so, the major shifts in his thinking would appear to have occurred after 1120, when his son William Adelin died, and 1129, when his daughter's marriage teetered on the verge of collapse.|$|E
5|$|As a young man, Lincoln was a {{religious}} skeptic, or, {{in the words}} of a biographer, an iconoclast. Later in life, Lincoln's frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own <b>personal</b> <b>beliefs</b> or might have been a device to appeal to his audiences, who were mostly evangelical Protestants. He never joined a church, although he frequently attended with his wife. However, he was deeply familiar with the Bible, and he both quoted and praised it. He was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others. Lincoln never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs. However, he did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and, by 1865, was expressing those beliefs in major speeches.|$|E

It was founded in Cooper by Kentucky native William L. Mayo, who served as its president from its foundation until his death in 1917, and moved to Commerce after its original campus burned down in 1894. A popular school for active teachers seeking state certification or recertification, it was largely shaped by Mayo's own <b>personal</b> <b>beliefs</b> about education, which focused on participation and hands-on learning instead of memorization or rote learning.|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims to {{shed light}} on the role of religious, spiritual and secular beliefs in individuals’ {{recovery}} from problematic substance use in Scotland. The findings are based on semi-structured interviews with twenty individuals, living in Scotland, who had past experience of problematic substance use. The methodology was influenced by narrative theory and the analysis drew on a thematic narrative approach. It is suggested that individuals in recovery construct <b>personal</b> <b>belief</b> systems by drawing chiefly on established cultural <b>belief</b> systems. <b>Personal</b> <b>belief</b> systems are learned and reinforced through practice, notably, engaging with belief-orientated communities and practising personal rituals. Participants use their <b>personal</b> <b>belief</b> systems as frameworks to interpret and give meaning to fundamental experiences that were part of their recovery. <b>Personal</b> <b>belief</b> systems are also integral to the construction of identity in recovery, helping individuals to establish a new self or reclaim an idealised past self. While <b>personal</b> <b>belief</b> systems did not often fit within neat religious, spiritual or secular categories, those with religious and/or spiritual beliefs often stressed the importance of their beliefs and associated practices to their recovery. Secular existential beliefs were also important to some people. The implications of these findings are discussed in terms of research, policy and practice...|$|R

5|$|Kemp was {{considered}} {{the star of the}} 1992 Republican National Convention. In 1992 and 1993, Kemp {{was considered}} the favorite or co-favorite for the 1996 Presidential nomination. At the time of the 1994 mid-term elections, Kemp was widely anticipated to announce his candidacy for 1996, and his supporters wanted a formal announcement {{by the end of the}} year. In January 1995, Kemp's stated reason for not entering the 1996 Republican Party presidential primaries was that his <b>personal</b> <b>beliefs</b> were out of balance with the contemporary Republican political landscape: Kemp opposed term limits, he always preferred tax cuts to anything resembling a balanced budget amendment and, unlike most Republicans, favored federal incentives to combat urban poverty. In 1995, Gloria Borger noted Kemp was not in step with the 1994 Contract with America. Kemp also noted a distaste for the vast fundraising necessary for a Presidential campaign. Gergen stated that by 1996 the selection process had become so expensive, mean and personally invasive that it discouraged several top Republicans from running. In 1995, while the world awaited the campaign decision announcement by Colin Powell, Kemp had positive thoughts on the prospect of such a campaign.|$|E

She has argued that parents in the United States of America who refuse to vaccinate their children {{on the grounds of}} religion are abusing the law and are falsely presenting their reasons as religious, when they are actually based on a <b>personal</b> <b>belief.</b> Reiss points out that major religions actually support vaccination. Reiss suggests three possible solutions to the problem of people abusing religious exemptions: tightening the requirements for religious exemptions, stopping all non-medical exemptions, or only allowing <b>personal</b> <b>belief</b> exemptions. She has shown preference only for a <b>personal</b> <b>belief</b> exemption, albeit a narrow one which would require a demanding process to be granted.|$|R

25|$|Ramsey in {{his article}} disagrees with Keynes's {{approach}} as for him {{there is a difference}} between the notions of probability in physics and in logic. For Ramsey probability is not related to a disembodied body of knowledge but is related to the knowledge that each individual possesses alone. Thus <b>personal</b> <b>beliefs</b> that are formulated by this individual knowledge govern probabilities, leading to the notions of subjective probability and Bayesian probability. Consequently, subjective probabilities can be inferred by observing actions that reflect individuals' <b>personal</b> <b>beliefs.</b> Ramsey argued that the degree of probability that an individual attaches to a particular outcome can be measured by finding what odds the individual would accept when betting on that outcome.|$|E

Using two waves of data drawn from a large random sample of working adults in Switzerland, results showed that <b>personal</b> <b>belief</b> in a just world at time 1 indeed augmented perceptions of overall organizational justice, and this in turn increased job satisfaction at time 2, that is, 1 year later.
