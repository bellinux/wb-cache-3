40|$|In {{the past}} year the Social Security Administration (SSA), the Federal Reserve Bank, the World Bank, President Clinton, Vice President Gore, and <b>President-elect</b> <b>Bush</b> have all {{expressed}} the need to "save" Social Security. The seeming crisis is {{due in large part}} to what is termed the graying of the nation, the increased proportion of retirement aged individuals. a For the Social Security program to fulfill its goals of protecting seniors from poverty by providing a retirement income and insuring a retirement for future generations, the system requires dramatic change. The ultimate goal of this paper is to evaluate the proposed solutions to the Social Security problem, focusing specifically on creating individual retirement accounts and therefore creating an individual property right to Social Security. After focusing on the problems facing Social Security, the paper will analyze the Chilean private pension system as a model for US reform, look at public opinion on Social Security reform, and finally attempt to forecast the political feasibility of the proposed policy...|$|E

[...] It {{has been reported that}} Scooter Libby intercepted the letter. Sidney Blumenthal also reported on the letter Clare Wolfowitz wrote:This embittered letter remained a closely guarded secret, although a former high official of the CIA told me about it. Chris Nelson also reported it on April 16 in his widely respected, nonpartisan foreign policy newsletter: [...] "A certain Ms. Riza was even then Wolfowitz's true love. The problem for the CIA wasn't just that she was a foreign national, although that was and is today an issue for anyone interested in CIA employment. The problem was that Wolfowitz was married to someone else, and that someone was really angry about it, and she found a way to bring her complaint directly to the President. So when we, with our characteristic innocence, put Wolfowitz on our short-list for CIA, we were instantly told, by a very, very, very senior Republican foreign policy operative, 'I don't think so.' [...] " [...] The Daily Mail of London also reported on his wife's letter when Wolfowitz was appointed president of the World Bank in 2005.|$|R

40|$|At {{the dawn}} of the twenty-first century American historians are unusually {{qualified}} to advise on social policy. With the passage in 1996 of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, much of the nation s system of public assistance for the poor was given back to the states and localities. President Clinton promised to end welfare as we know it, and he did. But President Clinton did not abolish welfare: in dimensions financial, legal, administrative, and moral, too polyphonous to name here, the new system is trying to revive welfare as historians of the 1870 s know it. Likewise, with the inauguration of <b>President-elect</b> George W. <b>Bush,</b> the government s social services from poverty alleviation to drug abuse treatment will go, Bush promises, increasingly into the hands of faith-based groups. Of course the economic viability and the constitutionality of the faith-based subsidy is being challenged. And again, history offers ample precedent. The vision of the President-elect, and the immediate reactions against it, are reminiscent of the 1820 s and of the 1870 s 1900 s movement to organize charity. So it is especially fortunate that the historian David C. Hammack has published the essays and excerpts that comprise Making the Nonprofit Sector in the United States: A Reader. ...|$|R
5000|$|Jackson {{had some}} {{controversial}} interactions with Jewish leaders {{in his early}} years in office. In 1996, his message of unity and cooperation with the Jews was met with skepticism. In 1997, Jackson was criticized for stating simple disagreement with anti-Semitic remarks made by Louis Farrakhan {{while he was in}} New York City for the mayoral race; Jewish leaders were unsatisfied by Jackson's response to Farrakhan. In 1997, Newsweek mentioned Jackson in their list of 100 people to watch in the new century, dubbed [...] "the Century Club", and raised the question of whether he would be the first black president. Jackson criticized the Bill Clinton administration for working with Republicans and voted in dissent on several notable bills that were the products of compromise between Democrats and Republicans. Jackson preferred direct aid and debt relief to trade reform as a method of helping impoverished nations such as those of sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean Basin, fearing that relaxed trade regulations would possibly benefit corporations and exploit labor. He is also an opponent of incentives for corporations to invest in developing nations. He was outspoken on issues of minority hiring in information technology. Jackson voted against the impeachment of Bill Clinton, voting against all four articles of impeachment considered by the House.In late 2000, as word spread that <b>President-elect</b> George W. <b>Bush</b> intended to appoint both Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice and a third unnamed black to the United States Cabinet, Jackson sought to prevent blacks from supporting Bush as Bush planned to reach out to blacks.
