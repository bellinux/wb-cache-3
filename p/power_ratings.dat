5|$|Except for 1980, the Pinto was {{available}} {{with a choice}} of two engines. For {{the first five years of}} production, only four-cylinder inline engines were offered. Ford changed the <b>power</b> <b>ratings</b> almost every year.|$|E
5|$|The {{two-stage}} Merlin {{family was}} extended in 1943 with the Merlin 66 {{which had its}} supercharger geared for increased <b>power</b> <b>ratings</b> at low altitudes, and the Merlin 70 series that were designed to deliver increased power at high altitudes.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Merlin's {{technical}} improvements {{resulted from}} more efficient superchargers, designed by Stanley Hooker, {{and the introduction}} of aviation fuel with increased octane ratings. Numerous detail changes were made internally and externally to the engine to withstand increased <b>power</b> <b>ratings</b> and to incorporate advances in engineering practices.|$|E
50|$|Low-quality {{power supply}} {{manufacturers}} sometimes {{take advantage of}} this overspecification by assigning unrealistically high <b>power</b> supply <b>ratings,</b> knowing that very few customers fully understand <b>power</b> supply <b>ratings.</b>|$|R
50|$|Automakers in the U.S. {{switched}} from gross to net <b>power</b> and torque <b>ratings</b> in 1972 (coinciding {{with the introduction}} of low-compression engines); thus, it is difficult to compare <b>power</b> and torque <b>ratings</b> between 1971 and 1972.|$|R
50|$|The {{generator}} voltage (volts), frequency (Hz) and <b>power</b> (watts) <b>ratings</b> {{are selected}} {{to suit the}} load that will be connected.|$|R

25|$|Powertrain {{availability}} and <b>power</b> <b>ratings</b> were unchanged for 1984. The 350cuin diesel engine came standard {{with an automatic}} overdrive transmission when equipped in station wagons.|$|E
25|$|The Wright R-760 Whirlwind was {{a series}} of seven-cylinder {{air-cooled}} radial aircraft engines built by the Wright Aeronautical division of Curtiss-Wright. These engines had a displacement of 756in³ (12.4L) and <b>power</b> <b>ratings</b> of 225-350hp (168-261kW).|$|E
50|$|A TO-3 P (plastic case) {{version of}} the 2N3055 and its {{complementary}} device MJ2955 are available as the TIP3055 and TIP2955 respectively, with slightly reduced <b>power</b> dissipation <b>ratings.</b>|$|R

25|$|A hydro-electric station rarely {{operates}} at its full power rating over a full year; the ratio between annual average power and installed capacity rating is the capacity factor. The installed capacity {{is the sum}} of all generator nameplate <b>power</b> <b>ratings.</b>|$|E
25|$|EC135 P2+ (Marketing name EC135 P2i):Latest current {{production}} {{version with}} 498kW (667 shp) PW206B2 (new <b>power</b> <b>ratings</b> {{based on a}} FADEC software upgrade), plus a 2,910kg (6,415lbs) M.T.O.W. upgrade, extended component time between overhaul (TBOs), and {{a change in the}} main transmission lubricating oil.

5000|$|... #Caption: Critics of {{numerical}} wine {{ratings have}} {{contended that the}} popularity and marketing <b>power</b> of these <b>ratings</b> have contributed to a homogenization of wine styles being offered on the market.|$|R
5000|$|Starfighters can be {{stationed}} on planets or capital starships and {{are built}} in squadrons of 12 apiece. They can fight in fleet battles, and have bombardment <b>power</b> and detection <b>ratings.</b>|$|R
50|$|In a {{conventional}} power station, the DNC rating {{is simply the}} maximum rated output minus the power consumed onsite. It is sometimes termed the switchyard output, and takes no account of transmission losses in the grid, which may be considerable {{in the case of}} a remote hydro station for example. Most but not all quoted <b>power</b> station <b>ratings</b> are DNC ratings rather than the simple capacity of the alternators.|$|R
25|$|Resistors {{required}} to dissipate {{substantial amounts of}} power, particularly used in power supplies, power conversion circuits, and power amplifiers, are generally referred to as power resistors; this designation is loosely applied to resistors with <b>power</b> <b>ratings</b> of 1 watt or greater. Power resistors are physically larger and may not use the preferred values, color codes, and external packages described below.|$|E
25|$|Resistors {{with higher}} <b>power</b> <b>ratings</b> are {{physically}} larger and may require heat sinks. In a high-voltage circuit, attention must sometimes {{be paid to}} the rated maximum working voltage of the resistor. While there is no minimum working voltage for a given resistor, failure to account for a resistor's maximum rating may cause the resistor to incinerate when current is run through it.|$|E
25|$|Xenon short-arc lamps {{also are}} {{manufactured}} with a ceramic body and an integral reflector. They {{are available in}} many output <b>power</b> <b>ratings</b> with either UV-transmitting or blocking windows. The reflector options are parabolic (for collimated light) or elliptical (for focused light). They are used {{in a wide variety}} of applications, such as video projectors, fiber optic illuminators, endoscope and headlamp lighting, dental lighting, and search lights.|$|E
40|$|For a {{representative}} sample of U. S. consumers, we rank, correlate and explain ratings of concern toward eight food production and processing technologies (antibiotics, pesticides, artificial growth hormones, genetic modification, irradiation, artificial colors/flavors, pasteurization, and preservatives). Concern is highest for pesticides and hormones, followed by concern toward antibiotics, genetic modification and irradiation. We document standard relationships between many demographic, economic and attitude variables and the average concern level. Our main contribution is modeling relative levels of concern across technologies, where we find that key personal and household characteristics that yield little explanatory <b>power</b> for average <b>ratings</b> have sharp discriminatory <b>power</b> for relative <b>ratings.</b> Consumer/Household Economics,...|$|R
50|$|Drawworks {{can be used}} {{to hoist}} or lower several hundred {{thousand}} pounds of weight and can come in AC, DC or mechanical <b>power</b> units. Horsepower <b>ratings</b> for drawworks can also have a wide range, often ranging from 1000 HP to over 3000 HP.|$|R
5000|$|The Vortec 5300 LMG (VIN code [...] "0") is the flexible-fuel {{version of}} the LY5. <b>Power</b> and torque <b>ratings</b> for SUV and pickup truck {{applications}} {{are the same as}} each application's LY5 rating. Variable valve timing was added for the 2010 model year.|$|R
25|$|The Mercury's smaller {{size was}} aimed at fighter use and it powered the Gloster Gauntlet and its successor, the Gloster Gladiator. It was {{intended}} that the larger Pegasus would be for bombers but as the <b>power</b> <b>ratings</b> of both engines rose, the Mercury found itself being used in almost all roles. Perhaps its most famous use was in a twin-engine light bomber, the Bristol Blenheim.|$|E
25|$|A related type is {{the power}} film capacitor. The {{materials}} and construction techniques used for large power film capacitors mostly {{are similar to those}} of ordinary film capacitors. However, capacitors with high to very high <b>power</b> <b>ratings</b> for applications in power systems and electrical installations are often classified separately, for historical reasons. The standardization of ordinary film capacitors is oriented on electrical and mechanical parameters. The standardization of power capacitors by contrast emphasizes the safety of personnel and equipment, as given by the local regulating authority.|$|E
25|$|When {{one side}} holds two {{outposts}} {{they are able}} to go into the Delving of Frór, a dungeon area beneath the Ettenmoors. Outposts (smaller keeps) are also objects of combat. Two outposts must be taken to enter the Delving of Frór. Monsters and Heroes progress through 15 ranks in the Ettenmoors by defeating opponents. Higher ranks give access to better equipment and armour, health, and <b>power</b> <b>ratings.</b> Commendations are given for quest completion or enemy kills and also permit purchase of statistic improvements, skills, equipment and appearance. Raids and groups permit faster advancement.|$|E
50|$|Power {{handling}} {{defines the}} ability of a switch to handle power and is very dependent on the design and materials used. There are different <b>power</b> handling <b>ratings</b> for switches such as hot switching, cold switching, average power and peak power. Hot switching occurs when RF/microwave power is present at the ports of the switching {{at the time of the}} switching. Cold switching occurs when the signal power is removed before switching. Cold switching results in lower contact stress and longer life.|$|R
5000|$|The {{initially}} available {{variant of}} the D24 produced a DIN-rated motive power output of [...] at 4,500 revolutions per minute (rpm); and it generated a torque of 155 Nm at 2,800 rpm. Subsequent minor updates and revisions resulted in differing <b>power</b> and torque <b>ratings.</b>|$|R
25|$|Interest in {{the design}} had largely {{disappeared}} by then; piston engines with the same <b>power</b> or greater <b>ratings</b> were widely available, the Merlin for example had improved tremendously and was offering at least , and the military and aircraft builders were already starting to focus on jet engines.|$|R
25|$|High power mercury vapor {{black light}} lamps {{are made in}} <b>power</b> <b>ratings</b> of 100 to 1000 watts. These do not use phosphors, but rely on the {{intensified}} and slightly broadened 350375nm spectral line of mercury from high pressure discharge at between , depending upon the specific type. These lamps use envelopes of Wood's glass or similar optical filter coatings to block out all the visible light and also the short wavelength (UVC) lines of mercury at 184.4 and 253.7nm, which are harmful to the eyes and skin. A few other spectral lines, falling within the pass band of the Wood's glass between 300 and 400nm, contribute to the output.|$|E
25|$|Many {{arrangements}} of electrical contacts are used. Large lamps {{may have a}} screw base (one or more contacts at the tip, one at the shell) or a bayonet base (one or more contacts on the base, shell used as a contact or used only as a mechanical support). Some tubular lamps have an electrical contact at either end. Miniature lamps may have a wedge base and wire contacts, and some automotive and special purpose lamps have screw terminals for connection to wires. Contacts in the lamp socket allow the electric current {{to pass through the}} base to the filament. <b>Power</b> <b>ratings</b> for incandescent light bulbs range from about 0.1 watt to about 10,000 watts.|$|E
25|$|The engine line-up {{remained}} {{almost identical}} to the 1970 model year, with most models featuring the 250 CID I-6 as standard. Broughams, Squires and GTs continued to have the 302-2V as standard, while the Cobra was downgraded to a 351-4V as its standard engine. All engines, other than the 429s, saw a slight drop in compression, which also resulted in a drop in <b>power</b> <b>ratings.</b> High insurance rates for muscle cars, and increasing concerns for emission controls were likely the reason for Ford's changes to its engines. Other manufactures were following suit, including Torino's main competitor Chevrolet's Chevelle, which featured lower compression on all of its 1971 engines, while SS models had the 350 CID 2-barrel as its standard engine. Ram Air induction remained an option on the 351-4V, 429 CJ, and the 429 SCJ.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{investigate}} how the credit cycle affects {{the link between}} bond spreads and credit ratings. Using a simple model of the credit assessment process, we show that when the debt market is more opaque, the information content of ratings deteriorates, creating an incentive for investors {{to increase the amount}} spent on private information. We test this hypothesis empirically. Results show that when market opaqueness (proxied by the spread between Aaa- and Baa-rated bonds) increases, the explanatory <b>power</b> of <b>ratings</b> and other control variables deteriorates as investors increasingly price in non-public information...|$|R
50|$|The LZ1 {{is almost}} entirely based on its predecessor, the LFA, but with some revisions, such as {{including}} up-integrated electronic throttle control, long-life spark plugs, GM’s Oil Life System, Active Fuel Management and variable valve timing.
