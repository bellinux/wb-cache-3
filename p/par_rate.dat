5000|$|There is no [...] "set" [...] <b>par</b> <b>rate,</b> {{and there}} is a great deal of {{competition}} in the marketplace. Many lenders will only offer products to reputable brokers, and may pay those brokers more for their client loans, which are deemed higher quality in nature. In contrast, the brokers with a more checkered past may find themselves locked out from premium wholesalers and not have access to the best interest rates, products, or prices for loans. For this reason, the YSP is not a useful tool for comparing offers for financing from several different brokers. If broker A is anticipating a yield spread premium of 2% for a rate of 6.00% on a 30-year fixed, while broker B is anticipating a 1% yield spread premium for the same rate and terms, there is nothing in the disclosure to differentiate which would be more advantageous to the buyer. If anything, it may be assumed that broker A has either a better-run business, or has access to higher quality products than broker B. All lenders investigate their prospective broker partners, and the mortgage industry uses a watchdog group known as the Mortgage Asset Recovery Institute (MARI). Brokers with significant defaults, previous fraudulent acts, or shady loan officers will find themselves quickly on the MARI list and lose access to the most competitive offerings.|$|E

The Sapien 3 device (Edwards Life-sciences) is different than the prior devices released by the same manufacturer in that it has a skirt designed to prevent paravalvular leak, improved coaxial alignment, and more accurate positioning. AimsTo evaluate paravalvular aortic regurgitations after 30 -day after TAVI using the Edwards SAPIEN 3 prosthesis. MethodsProspective monocentric study including 66 high-risk or non-operable patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI using Edwards SAPIEN 3 prosthesis via transfemoral access, between September 2014 and March 2015. ResultsMean age of patient was 84 ± 7, 1 years (70 % female). The MDCT estimated an aortic annular diameter 25, 07 ± 2 mm. Mean logistic EuroSCORE was 15, 8 ± 10, 8. In our study, the device success rate was 98. 5 %. The pros-thesis has been deployed correctly in all cases and no failure of valve or embolization had occurred. Post TAVR, mean transaortic gradient decreased from 46, 0 ± 12, 33 mmHg to 8, 2 ± 3, 37 mmHg (p< 0. 001). No patient had moderate or severe PAR. At 30 days follow up, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed that the PAR was absent or trivial in 66 % of patients and mild in the remainder. Possible reasons for this low <b>PAR</b> <b>rate</b> include: 1) the outer polyethylene terephthalate sealing cuff, which enhances paravalvular sealing; 2) more accurate positioning; and 3) improved sizing with adjunctive MDCT.

PURPOSE: In {{advanced}} urothelial cancer, {{treatment with}} dose-dense methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (ddMVAC) {{results in a}} high response rate, less toxicity, and few dosing delays. We explored the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant ddMVAC with pegfilgrastim support in muscle-invasive urothelial cancer (MIUC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with cT 2 -cT 4, N 0 - 1, M 0 MIUC were enrolled. Four cycles of ddMVAC were administered, followed by radical cystectomy. The primary end point was pathologic response (PaR) defined by pathologic downstaging to ≤ pT 1 N 0 M 0. The study used Simon's optimal two-stage design to evaluate null and alternative hypotheses of <b>PaR</b> <b>rate</b> of 35 % versus 55 %. Secondary end points included toxicity, disease-free survival (DFS), radiologic response (RaR), and biomarker correlates, including ERCC 1. RESULTS: Between December 2008 and April 2012, 39 patients (cT 2 N 0, 33 %; cT 3 N 0, 18 %; cT 4 N 0, 3 %; cT 2 - 4 N 1, 43 %; unspecified, 3 %) were enrolled. Median follow-up was 2 years. Overall, 49 % (80 % CI, 38 to 61) achieved PaR of ≤ pT 1 N 0 M 0, and we concluded this regimen was effective. High-grade (grade ≥ 3) toxicities were observed in 10 % of patients, with no neutropenic fevers or treatment-related death. One-year DFS was 89 % versus 67 % for patients who achieved PaR compared with {{those who did not}} (hazard ratio [HR], 2. 6; 95 % CI, 0. 8 to 8. 1; P =. 08) and 86 % versus 62 % for patients who achieved RaR compared with those who did not (HR, 4. 1; 95 % CI, 1. 3 to 12. 5; P =. 009). We found no association between serum tumor markers or ERCC 1 expression with response or survival. CONCLUSION: In patients with MIUC, neoadjuvant ddMVAC was well tolerated and resulted in significant pathologic and radiologic downstaging. Toni K.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} a dynamic {{model of the}} capital structure of a firm in which debt is callable and where equity holders act strategically to force renegotiations of debt when the bankruptcy threat is imminent. Far away from the bankruptcy threat the equity holders use the call feature to replace the existing debt in order to increasing the tax advantage of debt. On the other hand, when the bankruptcy threat is imminent, we do not, as in the existing literature, assume that the existing debt is called. Both the lower and upper reorganization points are derived endogenously. The endogeneity of the lower boundary is similar in spirit to the strategic debt service models of e. g. Anderson and Sundaresan (1996) and Mella-Barral and Perraudin (1997). However, in our model the entire debt is renegotiated. It {{is not just the}} current coupon payment which is fine tuned. The problem of finding the value process for the firm’s assets is solved by allowing for a fixed number of restructuring options and looking at the limit as this number goes to infinity. We investigate how firm value, equity value, debt value, <b>par</b> coupon <b>rates,</b> leverage, and credit spreads change with the number of remaining renegotiation options left.

BackgroundThe inverse relationship of PAR occurrence and oversizing has been demonstrated for the Sapien XT but the incidence of PAR with comparable oversizing with the Sapien 3 is not known. MethodsSixty-one prospectively enrolled patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement with the Sapien 3 THV were compared with 92 patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement with the Sapien XT THV. Patients were categorized depending on the degree of MDCT area oversizing percentage: undersizing (below 0 %), 0 % to 5 %, 5 % to 10 %, and above 10 %. The primary endpoint was mild or greater PAR on transthoracic echocardiography. ResultsMild or greater PAR was present in 19. 7 % of patients (12 of 61) in the Sapien 3 group and in 54. 3 % of patients (50 of 92) in the Sapien XT group (p  10 % (p for interaction = 0. 54).

40|$|I study, {{develop and}} {{implement}} selected interest rate models. I begin with a simple categorization of interest rate models and with an explanation why interest rate models are useful. I explain and discuss the notion of arbitrage. I use Oldrich Vasicek's seminal model (Vasicek; 1977) to develop the idea of no-arbitrage term structure modeling. I introduce both the partial di erential equation and the risk-neutral approach to zero-coupon bond pricing. I briefly comment on affine term structure models, a general equilibrium term structure model, and HJM framework. I present the Czech Treasury yield curve estimates at a daily frequency from 1999 to the present. I use the parsimonious Nelson-Siegel model (Nelson and Siegel; 1987), for which I suggest a parameter restriction that avoids abrupt changes in parameter estimates and thus allows for the economic interpretation of the model to hold. The Nelson-Siegel model is shown to fit the Czech bond price data well without being over-parameterized. Thus, the model provides an accurate and consistent picture of the Czech Treasury yield curve evolution. The estimated parameters {{can be used to}} calculate spot <b>rates</b> and hence <b>par</b> <b>rates,</b> forward rates or discount function for practically any maturity. To my knowledge, consistent time series of spot rates are not available for the Czech economy. I introduce two estimation techniques of the short-rate process. I begin with the maximum likelihood estimator of a square root diff usion. A square root di usion serves as the short rate process in the famous CIR model (Cox, Ingersoll and Ross; 1985 b). I develop and analyze two Matlab implementations of the estimation routine and test them on a three-month PRIBOR time series. A square root diff usion is a restricted version of, so called, CKLS di ffusion (Chan, Karolyi, Longsta and Sanders; 1992). I use the CKLS short-rate process to introduce the General Method of Moments as the second estimation technique. I discuss the numerical implementation of this method. I show the importance of the estimator of the GMM weighting matrix and question the famous empirical result about the volatility speci cation of the short-rate process. Finally, I develop a novel yield curve model, which is based on principal component analysis and nonlinear stochastic di erential equations. The model, which is not a no-arbitrage model, can be used in areas, where quantification of interest rate dynamics is needed. Examples, of such areas, are interest rate risk management, or the pro tability and risk evaluation of interest rate contingent claims, or di erent investment strategies.

To derive this rate we observe that the theoretical price of a bond can be calculated as the present value of the cash flows to be received in the future.

40|$|Automatic c ontrol of {{industrial}} flotation cells and circuits presents {{a set of}} significant challenges due {{to the number of}} variables, the sensitivity of flotation cells to variation in these variables and the complexity of predicting flotation performance and/ or deve loping a strategy for optim isation. Air recovery, a measure of froth stability, has been shown to pass through a peak as flotation cell aeration increases. Furthermore, the air rate at which the Peak Air Recovery (PAR) is obtained results in optimal flot ation performance, whether improved concentrate grade, recovery or both grade and recovery. Peak air recovery, therefore, presents a clear optimising control strategy for the operat ion of flotation cells which is generic to all flotation cells regardless of position in the flotation circuit. In this study, a novel control system based on PAR is developed and demonstrated using a large continuous laboratory flotation cell. In this study, a direct search optimisation algorithm based on the GSS (generating s et search) methodology was developed using a 70 l continuous flotation cell operating with a two - phase system (surfactant solution and air only). Characterisation of the laboratory system showed that it was stable for up to 6 hours and exhibited a reprodu cible peak in air recovery.

One involves maintaining a borrowing portfolio using {{short and long}} term debt lines in order to maintain an average borrowing cost.

The data set of implied volatilities (Appendix I used for interest cap quoting and pricing) consists of volatilities for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10 year maturities; the data set is made up of daily closing mid-quotes for the period. We examine whether interest rate caps would be a better alternative for minimising interest rate risk as compared to a structure that combines a portfolio of rolling short-term debt with one of rolling long-term debt lines. Using principal component analysis (PCA) we explore the behaviour of, and the number of factors driving volatilities. As caps are quoted in terms of implied volatilities, and we know BlackÃŒs (1976) model is very sensitive to changes in these volatilities. We use PCA to examine the factors driving cap price volatilities. We explore the best way of using caps to manage interest rate risk. This should help us understand what factors affect cap prices and how many factors might be used in the interest rate models used to price interest rate derivatives such as caps and floors. We use Sharpe ratios to assess the relative borrowing costs of different strategies in relation to the volatility of their outcomes. We examine whether interest rate caps would be a more efficient method for minimising interest rate risk as compared to the a portfolio of loans.
