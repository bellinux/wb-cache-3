5|$|On {{the day of}} Germanicus' death {{his sister}} Livilla gave birth to twins by Drusus. The oldest was named Germanicus and died young. In 37, Germanicus' only {{remaining}} son Caligula became emperor and renamed September Germanicus {{in honor of his}} father. Many Romans, in the account of Tacitus, considered Germanicus to be their equivalent to King Alexander the Great, and believed that he would have easily surpassed the achievements of Alexander had he become emperor. In book eight of his Natural History, Pliny connects Germanicus, Augustus, and Alexander as fellow equestrians: when Alexander's horse Bucephalus died he named a city Bucephalia in his honor. Less monumental, Augustus' horse received a funeral mound, which Germanicus wrote a <b>poem</b> <b>about.</b>|$|E
