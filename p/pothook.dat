So we interfered the data sets of the Yeast histone Methylation modification and Acetylation {{which are measured by}} <b>Pothook</b> et al. We got 16 kinds of protein modification date sets in the whole genome. Then we processed the each of data sets by aligning, averaging and normalizing data around the TSS (about 1000 bp from upstream or downstream). After we grouped the whole genome histone modification data sets according to the Yeast genome transcription level data: one modified groups promote transcription, and the other modified groups inhibit transcription or are independent of transcription. In order to reveal the complex relationships between different transcriptional activity of genetically modified, we calculated the correlation among several modifications with two by algorithms–Pearson correlation analysis and MINE proposed by David N. Reshelf et al. We analyzed the results and got some non-linear relationship between histone modifications. We also found that the association between histone modifications stronger in the same modified group...|$|E
30|$|The {{coronavirus}} {{has a large}} genome {{of about}} 30  kb, while the overall size of the viral particle is comparable with that of other RNA virus (for coronavirus, ~ 85  nm in diameter; for human immunodeficiency virus, 120 – 170  nm in diameter, ~ 2  ×  9  kb genome size (Briggs et al., 2003); for human respiratory syncytial virus, 150 – 250  nm in diameter, ~ 15  kb genome size (Mejias and Ramilo, 2015)). It seems that the space inside the envelope would be inadequate for a coronavirus to encapsulate loosely packed RNPs. In a way similar to the eukaryotic cell genome packaging, coronaviruses package the genome to form a supercoiled dense structure (Fig.  2 I and 2 J) for their large genome packaging. Sequence alignments of the N proteins showed more than 24 % identity among different coronaviruses (Fig. S 4) and structural comparison of the coronavirus N proteins also showed high similarity. Thus the <b>pothook</b> shape subunit we observed could be a common building unit of all the coronaviruses for the assembly of their RNPs. Taking together, our results here provide new insight into {{our understanding of the}} coronavirus RNP assembly.|$|E
30|$|Crystal {{structural}} {{studies of}} the CTDs showed that the CTDs pack head to head into octamers (Fig.  2 E) and form a twin helix in the crystal (Chang et al., 2014). A putative model of the RNP was proposed based on the crystal packing of the CTDs. Based on our fitting result, we superimposed subunit densities onto the crystal CTD octamers and generated {{a model of the}} RNP (Fig.  2 F and 2 G). In the model we proposed, two subunits pack head to head into a helical filament. The width of the modeled filament is twice of the subunit (~ 15  nm). Distance between the repeating strands, which is the distance of the two arms of the <b>pothook,</b> is around 7  nm. The parameters of the modeled filament are consistent with our observation for the isolated RNP filament. The coronavirus N protein interact with RNA at multiple regions, including CTD, NTD and the LKR region (Chang et al., 2014). The residues at the positive charged groove of NTD are reported to be crucial for the N protein and RNA interaction in coronavirus (Chang et al., 2016). Based on these biochemical data and the surface electrostatic potential of the proposed model, we identified possible RNA binding sites of the N protein and proposed possible genomic RNA binding groove in the helical RNP model (Figs.  2 H and S 2 C).|$|E

40|$|Mapping has {{virtually}} been completed on the batholith (scale- 1 : 1320) {{and the next}} phase of the program will be to refine contacts, descriptions of rock units, and their relationships to one another. This will be done by carrying out detailed work on some of the mining properties. REGIONAL SETTING The Iron Mask batholith is a multiphase intrusion comprised of Iron Mask Hybrid, <b>Pothook,</b> Sugarloaf, and Cherry Creek units, each of which has several varietie! [...] The rocks are fine grained and fine porphyritic to coarse grained and are silica-poor rmging from gabbro to syenite composition with diorite predominating. Major systems of northwesterly, northerly, and northeasterly trending recurrilig fractures or faults controlled emplacement of various units of the Iron Mask batholith. The batholith was emplaced in a high level volcanic to subvolcanic environment, comagmatic with Nicola volcanic rocks and coeval with part of the upper Nicola succession. The batholith intruded volcanic and sedimentary rocks of the lower Nicola but the Cherry Creek unit occurs both as fragments within, and is in intrusive contact with, uppermost Nicola rocks. The Nicola and Iron Mask rocks are unconformably overlain by Tertiary sedinentary and volcanic rocks of the Kamloops Group. In many places on and along the flanks of the batholith the pre-Tertiary erosion surface appears nearly to coincide with the present day erosion surface. Erosional remnants of Tertiary volcanic rocks cap the higher hills and occur in places along their flanks. This pre-Tertiary erosional surface appears to have been very irregular although post-Tertiary faulting may have accentuated this apparent irregularity and resulted in local preservation of post-batholith rocks within the batholith.

2500|$|Originally, {{at the end}} of the Diele {{near the}} back of the farmhouse, was the Flett, an open kitchen and dining area that took up the entire width of the house. The open fireplace, about 1.5 metres across, was located in the middle of the Flett and was ringed with fieldstones. It was not like a hearth in other regions. Many types of cooking were not {{possible}} in this environment (*). Pots had to be high enough, in effect cauldrons, and were hung over the fire with <b>pothooks</b> attached to a wooden frame (Rahmen) hanging over the fireplace, often decorated with horses heads. At night an iron grid was pulled over the fire to prevent sparks, a practice known by the English term curfew. Well-to-do families had a candle arch (Schwibbogen) of masonry instead of a wooden frame. Smoke escaped through an opening in the roof on the gable, the Uhlenloch (also Eulenloch, literally: [...] "owl hole"). The open fireplace meant that such buildings were considered as a particular fire risk by early fire insurance firms. The open fire also provided some heat to the stalls and living quarters of the Hallenhaus. In this way, hay stored in the loft could be dried out and protected from vermin by the smoke. When the farmer's family and farm hands gathered for meal times, the best places were between the fireplace and the rooms. Because there was no partition between Diele and loft, winter temperatures in the Flett never rose above 12°C.|$|R
6000|$|Nevertheless Mr. Neefit {{resolved}} upon {{having his}} own way, {{and it was}} settled that Ralph Newton should be asked to come and eat a bit of dinner on next Sunday. Then there arose a difficulty as to the mode of asking him. Neefit himself felt {{that it would be}} altogether out of his line to indite an invitation. In days gone by, before he kept a clerk for the purpose, he had written very many letters to gentlemen, using various strains of pressure as he called their attention to the little outstanding accounts which stood on his books and were thorns in his flesh. But of the writing of such letters as this now intended to be written he had no experience. As for Mrs. Neefit, her skill in this respect was less even than that of her husband. She could write, no doubt. On very rare occasions she would make some expression of her thoughts with pen and ink to Polly, when she and Polly were apart. But no one else ever saw how slight was her proficiency in this direction. But Polly was always writing. Polly's <b>pothooks,</b> as her father called them, were pictures in her father's eyes. She could dash off straight lines of writing,--line after line,--with sharp-pointed angles and long-tailed letters, in a manner which made her father proud of the money which he had spent on her education. So Polly was told to write the letter, and after many expressions of surprise, Polly wrote the letter that evening. [...] "Mr. and Mrs. Neefit's compliments to Mr. Newton, and hope he will do them the honour to dine with them on Sunday next at five o'clock. Alexandrina Cottage, Sunday." ...|$|R
6000|$|But, {{since an}} {{imitation}} of the Greeks in this particular (the asking of questions being one chief privilege of freemen) is hardly to be hoped for, and our candidates will answer, whether they are questioned or not, I would recommend that these ante-electionary dialogues should be carried on by symbols, as were the diplomatic correspondences of the Scythians an Macrobii, or confined {{to the language of}} signs, like the famous interview of Panurge and Goatsnose. A candidate might then convey a suitable reply to all committees of inquiry by closing one eye, or by presenting them with a phial of Egyptian darkness to be speculated upon by their respective constituencies. These answers would be susceptible of whatever retrospective construction the exigencies of the political campaign might seem to demand, and the candidate could take his position {{on either side of the}} fence with entire consistency. Or, if letters must be written, profitable use might be made of the Dighton rock hieroglyphic or the cuneiform script, every fresh decipherer of which is enabled to educe a different meaning, whereby a sculptured stone or two supplies us, and will probably continue to supply posterity, with a very vast and various body of authentic history. For even the briefest epistle in the ordinary chirography is dangerous. There is scarce any style so compressed that superfluous words may not be detected in it. A severe critic might curtail that famous brevity of Cæsar's by two thirds, drawing his pen through the supererogatory veni and vidi. Perhaps, after all, the surest footing of hope is to be found in the rapidly increasing tendency to demand less and less of qualification in candidates. Already have statesmanship, experience, and the possession (nay, the profession, even) of principles been rejected as superfluous, and may not the patriot reasonably hope that the ability to write will follow? At present, there may be death in <b>pothooks</b> as well as pots, the loop of a letter may suffice for a bowstring, and all the dreadful heresies of Antislavery may lurk in a flourish.--H.W.] ...|$|R
60|$|Now {{this little}} building, {{and others like}} it, were an {{original}} kind of fortification invented by the founders of New England. They are the martello-towers that protect our coast. This was the great discovery of our Puritan forefathers. They were the first lawgivers who saw clearly and enforced practically the simple moral and political truth, that knowledge was not an alms {{to be dependent on}} the chance charity of private men or the precarious pittance of a trust-fund, but a sacred debt which the Commonwealth owed to every one of her children. The opening of the first grammar-school was the opening of the first trench against monopoly in church and state; the first row of trammels and <b>pothooks</b> which the little Shearjashubs and Elkanahs blotted and blubbered across their copy-books, was the preamble to the Declaration of Independence. The men who gave every man the chance to become a landholder, who made the transfer of land easy, and put knowledge within the reach of all, have been called narrow-minded, because they were intolerant. But intolerant of what? Of what they believed to be dangerous nonsense, which, if left free, would destroy the last hope of civil and religious freedom. They had not come here that every man might do that which seemed good in his own eyes, but in the sight of God. Toleration, moreover, is something which is won, not granted. It is the equilibrium of neutralized forces. The Puritans had no notion of tolerating mischief. They looked upon their little commonwealth as upon their own private estate and homestead, as they had a right to do, and would no more allow the Devil's religion of unreason to be preached therein, than we should permit a prize-fight in our gardens. They were narrow; in other words they had an edge to them, as men that serve in great emergencies must; for a Gordian knot is settled sooner with a sword than a beetle.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{was a nice}} boy to {{let loose}} in a school. I could speak {{as well as an}} actor, as far as {{pronunciation}} goes; but I could hardly read words of one syllabile; and as to writing, I couldn't make <b>pothooks</b> and hangers respectably. To this day, I can no more spell than old Ned Skene can. What was a worse sort of ignorance was that I had no idea of fair play. I thought that all servants would be afraid of me, and that all grown-up people would tyrannize over me. I was afraid of everybody; afraid that my cowardice would be found out; and as angry and cruel in my ill-tempers as cowards always are. Now you'll hardly believe this; but what saved me from going to the bad altogether was my finding out that I was a good one to fight. The bigger boys were given to fighting, and used to have mills every Saturday afternoon, with seconds, bottle-holders, and everything complete, except the ropes and stakes. We little chaps used to imitate them among ourselves as best we could. At first, when they made me fight, I shut my eyes and cried; but for all that I managed to catch the other fellow tight round the waist and throw him. After that it became a regular joke to make me fight, for I always cried. But the end of it was that I learned to keep my eyes open and hit straight. I had no trouble about fighting then. Somehow, I could tell by instinct when the other fellow was going to hit me, and I always hit him first. It's the same with me now in the ring; I know what a man is going to do before he rightly knows himself. The power that this gave me, civilized me. It made me cock of the school; and I had to act accordingly. I had enough good-nature left to keep me from being a bully; and, as cock, I couldn't be mean or childish. There would be nothing like fighting for licking boys into shape if every one could be cock; but every one can't; so I suppose it does more harm than good.|$|R
