5|$|By June President Habyarimana {{had come}} to view Hutu Power, rather than the {{mainstream}} opposition, as {{the biggest threat to}} his leadership. This led him to change tactics and engage fully with the Arusha <b>peace</b> <b>process,</b> giving it the impetus it needed to draw to a completion. According to Prunier, this support was more symbolic than genuine. Habyarimana believed that he could maintain power more easily through a combination of limited concessions to the opposition and RPF, than he could if Hutu Power were allowed to disrupt the <b>peace</b> <b>process.</b> The RPF enjoyed much greater leverage following their successful February campaign, and the government eventually agreed to their power-sharing demands. The RPF were allocated up to 40% of the troops in the proposed unified national armed forces, and 50% of the officer corps. With all details agreed, the Arusha Accords were finally signed on 4 August 1993 at a formal ceremony attended by President Habyarimana as well as heads of state from neighbouring countries.|$|E

40|$|The Varieties of Peace {{research}} program aims to analyze {{long-term effects of}} <b>peace</b> <b>processes</b> in conflicts that ended in the 1990 s. The central research questions are: What characterizes peace after the <b>peace</b> <b>processes</b> initiated in the 1990 s {{and how does it}} vary? How can this variation be described and explained? <b>Peace</b> <b>processes</b> have been studied using short time perspectives, usually in ”lessons-learned” evaluations five years after conflict termination, and usually with theories of conflict as a starting point. The Varieties of Peace {{research program}} is an ambitious initiative, which starts from a theoretical understanding of peace, its quality and character, and views <b>peace</b> and <b>peace</b> <b>processes</b> as dynamic and transformative. It will investigate and evaluate different types of <b>peace</b> <b>processes</b> from a comparative perspective and 25 – 30 years after they started, with the ambition of producing generalizable knowledge about peace, what it is and how it can be achieved. As a starting point, the program studies explanatory factors in five areas: 1) the actions, capacity and resilience of civil society, 2) the interests and strategies of the elites, 3) the aims and character of the agreements, 4) the societies’ institutions and resilience, and 5) international involvement. These issues will be studies in at least ten projects, with the ambition to capture and explain variation, internal dynamics and ultimately the results and effects of <b>peace</b> <b>processes,</b> studied {{over a longer period of}} time.  The Varieties of Peace program is funded by Riksbankens Jubileumsfond: the Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences, 2017 - 2024.

This and the general international condemnation after Nyadzonya made the Rhodesians very hesitant to authorise any more external operations, even covertly, while the <b>peace</b> <b>process</b> crawled on during {{the last months of}} 1976. Two further unsuccessful rounds of negotiations took place between September and December: first the United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger thrashed out a deal, which in September the Rhodesians accepted and the nationalists rejected, then from October to December 1976 the government and nationalist parties took part in the abortive British-mediated Geneva Conference.|$|E

In honor of this ceremony, the former President of the Philippines Elpidio Quirino established the Order of Sikatuna, a presidential decoration conferred upon politicians. Juan Luna, a Filipino painter, depicted this event in his painting entitled The Blood Compact (Spanish: El Pacto de Sangre) in 1883. El Pacto de Sangre obtained the first prize in Paris in 1885 and at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition of St. Louis in 1904.

40|$|Women’s {{participation}} in <b>peace</b> <b>processes</b> {{has been given}} attention by scholars, {{and it is now}} well established that the inclusion of women promotes durable peace. Despite the recognition of their important role, women’s actual participation is rare. Previous studies have been focusing on motivating the inclusion of women rather than specifying what it is in women’s participation that generates durable peace. This thesis therefore seeks to theoretically define previous scholars’ explanations on how women contribute to durable peace, and to empirically examine four cases of <b>peace</b> <b>processes</b> of which two are categorized as sustained peace, and two as failed peace. This study indicates that women’s {{participation in}} <b>peace</b> <b>processes</b> on formal as well as on informal levels can influence the peace agreements and thereby contribute to durable peace. This study makes a valuable contribution to the current research by systematically comparing four cases of <b>peace</b> <b>processes</b> whereas previous research has mainly studied one or two cases. However, this research field requires further research in order to identify more distinct trends and explain in what way women contribute to durable peace...|$|R

As Enterprise nears the planet, Chang's cloaked Bird of Prey moves to intercept. With Enterprise unable to track his ship's position, Chang inflicts severe damage on Enterprise and then Excelsior. At the suggestion of Uhura, the Enterprise's communication officer, Spock and McCoy modify a photon torpedo to home in on the exhaust emissions of Chang's vessel, using equipment originally intended to study gaseous anomalies.

The Soviet Union contributed an unknown sum. The slow {{response to}} requests for aid was contributed to by the Sandinista Government's actions, which was viewed by a few anonymous diplomats from other countries who commented to the press, as undermining the <b>peace</b> <b>process</b> championed by Óscar Arias.
