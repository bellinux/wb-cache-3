6000|$|Sharm Yáhárr is {{the usual}} {{distorted}} T, a long channel heading in a shorter cross-piece: it is formed by the confluence of four valleys, all composed of corallines and conglomerates of new sandstone. Those {{to the north and}} the north-west show distinct signs of upheaval; the two eastern features, known as the Wady el-Hárr ("the Hot Watercourse"), of which Yáhárr appears to be a corruption, bear marks of man's hand. The dock is divided into an outer and inner [...] "port" [...] by a projecting northern point which is not sufficiently marked in the Chart (enlarged plan). At this place, where the tide rises a full metre, the crew of the Mukhbir had built a jetty of rough boulders, by way of passe-temps and to prevent wading. Native craft lie inside, opposite the ruins of a stone house: the existence of a former population is shown by the many graves on the upper plateau. In the northern Wady el-Hárr, also, we picked up specimens of obsidian, oligistic iron, and admirably treated modern (?) slags showing copper and iron; evidently some Gypsy-like atelier must once have worked upon the Wady Yáhárr. The obsidian also has apparently been subjected to the artificial fire; and a splinter of it contains a <b>paillette</b> of free copper.|$|E
50|$|The El Musel port {{was built}} {{as a result of}} the {{industrial}} revolution that began in the second half of the 19th century in Asturias, based on iron and steel manufacturing and more particularly on coal mining in the central basins of the region. Right from the start, these two industrial activities were to be promoted by bankers and native and essentially foreign experts. Alejandro Aguado, Pedro Duro Benito, Policarpo Herrero Vázquez, José Tartiere Lenegre, Luis Belaunde Costa, Numa Guilhou, Adriane <b>Paillette,</b> Guillermo Schulz, Luis Adaro Magro, Jerónimo Ibrán Mulá and Isidoro Clausel de Coussergues are just some of the most representative names in an extensive group of industrialists and experts who were the true originators of Asturian industrialisation. The implementation of these industries was in turn to promote the progress of trade, the growth of the main urban centres and the adaptation of new communicational routes in the shape of roads, rail and ports, introducing a new capitalist production system into the region in contrast to the traditional agricultural economy.|$|E

30|$|Insect songs {{had a good}} {{stability}} that {{is already}} used as a powerful tool in taxonomy, especially in some close-related species (Schul [1998]). Our result also suggested a stable acoustic trait in L. migratoria migratoria, which means that these methods could not only be used in L. migratoria migratoria but also in other acoustic insects such as katydids, crickets, and cicadas. Some studies showed {{that there was a}} differentiation of songs between geographically isolated populations (Heady and Denno [1991]; <b>Paillette</b> et al. [1997]). It is still not very clear for us whether there was a big differentiation of songs in L. migratoria migratoria; if so, we need to adjust the system to adapt to its changes in other locations, but it is convenient to just change some parameters.|$|E

50|$|Sequins are {{sometimes}} {{also referred to}} as spangles, <b>paillettes,</b> or diamantes, but technically differ. In costuming, sequins have a center hole, while spangles have the hole located at the top. <b>Paillettes</b> themselves are commonly very large and flat. Sequins may be stitched flat to the fabric, so that they do not move, and are less likely to fall off; or they may be stitched at only one point, so that they dangle and move easily, to catch more light. Some sequins are made with multiple facets, to increase their reflective ability.|$|R

The coat, {{which had a}} pleated frill at the front and neck, was of ivory boucle, decorated with gold, silver and ivory <b>paillettes</b> and Swarovski crystals. The matching hat had a small cockade of feathers in gold, silver and ivory, each trimmed with a crystal. Her jewels were the diamond starburst [...] "Jardine brooch", a three-strand pearl necklace, and pearl earrings {{that had belonged to}} her grandmother, Queen Mary.

5000|$|Fashion {{designer}} Bob Mackie created nine unique ensembles for the Love Hurts Tour, {{repeating the}} same Leather/Dominatrix style of the Geffen-era. On this, Cher used some clothes already used in previous tours or for public appearances. The first, is {{for the performance of}} [...] "We All Sleep Alone" [...] and [...] "I Found Someone" [...] where Cher wore clothes with holes and <b>paillettes</b> and the black curly wig. For the first song she added a black leather jacket. This dress was previously used in [...] "The Black Rose Show" [...] and in the [...] "I Found Someone" [...] music video. During the performance of [...] "After All" [...] Cher wore an Ice Queen fur coat with sequined designs and pointed hat. This was used in the Heart of Stone Tour. The last one was similar to the dress she wore when she attended the Academy Awards and won her award for Best Actress in 1988. This was used for the performance of [...] "Many Rivers to Cross" [...] and was a dark, sparkly, and transparent dress.|$|R
6000|$|This pit had {{two main}} galleries, both choked with rubbish, {{leading to the}} east and west; and the explorers could see light glimmering through the cracks and crevices of the roof--these doubtless gave passage to the wild carnivore. In other parts the surface, {{especially}} where the earth is red, was pitted with shallow basins; and a large depression showed the sinking of the hollowed crust. Negro quartz was evidently abundant; but we {{came to the conclusion that}} the rock mostly worked was, like that of Shuwák, a rosy, mauve-coloured schist, with a deep-red fracture, and brilliant colours before they are tarnished by atmospheric oxygen. It abounds in mica, which, silvery as fish-scales, overspreads it in patches; and the precious metal had probably been sought in the veinlets between the schist and its quartz-walling. In two pieces, specks, or rather <b>paillettes,</b> of gold were found lightly and loosely adhering to the [...] "Marú" [...] so lightly, indeed, that they fell off when carelessly pocketed Veins of schist still remained, but in the galleries they had been followed out to the uttermost fibril.|$|R
5000|$|Jenny's {{character}} further gained prominence {{during the}} show's third season. Enid Portugez of the LA Times praised Jenny's fashionable skills, stating that [...] "Jenny capped off the drama by showing us she's becoming extremely adept at becoming a drug dealer. Her brilliant idea to sew pills into jacket <b>paillettes</b> {{could have easily}} won her a [...] "Project Runway" [...] challenge! Despite the illegality of it all, {{it was nice to}} see Jenny put her wit and wiles to use..." [...] Following the dramatic events during the third season finale, Michael Ausiello praised both Leighton Meester and Taylor Momsen's performance. L.J. Gibbs, from TV Fanatic, gave the episode a 3.5 rating star out of 5, and said that he felt that Chuck being shot {{at the end of the}} episode was a very [...] "cheap move by the writers", and that the storyline involving Chuck and Jenny having sex was very [...] "unlikely". Mark O. Estes, from TV Overmind, had also praised Taylor Momsen's performance in the episode and said that he [...] "wish that Jenny had of gotten her own spin-off", and questions that if her send-off in this episode means that the show's writers have a [...] "Katherine Heigl" [...] situation on their hands". However, Jenny was included in TV Guide list of The Most Loathed TV Characters.|$|R
40|$|Fresh 36 ejaculates of 13 stallions {{were split}} into two volumes, {{centrifuged}} with and without cushion and frozen with Conventional and two prototype, Drum and Directional, methods using 0. 5 ml straws for the Conventional and Drum, and 2 ml flat straws for both the Drum and Directional. Cushioned centrifugation increased total motility (61. 2 ± 18. 6 % vs. 57. 5 ± 18. 6 %; P ＜ 0. 001) and mean velocity (84. 3 ± 15. 6 % vs. 83. 2 ± 13. 8 %; P ＜ 0. 05) when compared to not cushioned centrifugation, estimated after cooling the sperm at 4 °C for 90 min before freezing. Cushioned centrifugation also increased (P ＜ 0. 001) spermatozoa with polarized mitochondrial membranes (46. 8 ± 11. 4 % vs. 43. 4 ± 10. 6 %) and intact plasmatic/acrosomal membranes (41. 0 ± 11. 2 % vs. 38. 5 ± 11. 3 %) of frozen/thawed sperm, with respect to not cushioned centrifugation. However, no effects of the centrifugation were evidenced for classical kinetic parameters. Flat straws had negative effect for almost all the parameters analyzed at thawing (T 0) and after 3 hours’ incubation at 37 °C (T 1), while the Drum method with <b>Paillettes</b> did not show appreciable affects. The variability among stallions was relevant (5 % to 69 % variance for kinetics and membrane status), while the variability among ejaculates was minor (9 % to 28 %). Factorial analysis identified three relevant factors with different informational content: Factor 1 represented by membranes status, Factor 2 by kinetics estimated at T 0, and Factor 3 by kinetics estimated at T 1. Cushioned centrifugation had some beneficial effects for the membrane status of the frozen/thawed sperm, while the use of flat straws needs to be improved...|$|R
