5|$|Published {{chromosome}} counts {{exist for}} two species, Aiphanes minima and A.horrida; haploid chromosome counts vary from 15 to 18. Borchsenius and Bernal report {{that it is}} difficult to get accurate chromosome counts in <b>palms</b> <b>and</b> that differences in chromosome counts may reflect these difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Ceratopsid teeth, {{including}} those of Styracosaurus, were arranged in groups called batteries. Older teeth on top were continually replaced by the teeth underneath them. Unlike hadrosaurids, which also had dental batteries, ceratopsid teeth sliced but did not grind. Some scientists have suggested that ceratopsids like Styracosaurus ate <b>palms</b> <b>and</b> cycads, while others have suggested ferns. Dodson has proposed that Late Cretaceous ceratopsians may have knocked down angiosperm trees and then sheared off leaves and twigs.|$|E
5|$|Chad's {{animal and}} plant life {{correspond}} to the three climatic zones. In the Saharan region, the only flora is the date-palm groves of the oasis. <b>Palms</b> <b>and</b> acacia trees grow in the Sahelian region. The southern, or Sudanic, zone consists of broad grasslands or prairies suitable for grazing. As of 2002, {{there were at least}} 134 species of mammals, 509 species of birds (354 species of residents and 155 migrants), and over 1,600 species of plants throughout the country.|$|E

5|$|Chickenpox was {{commonly}} {{confused with}} smallpox {{in the immediate}} post-eradication era. Chickenpox and smallpox can be distinguished by several methods. Unlike smallpox, chickenpox does not usually affect the <b>palms</b> <b>and</b> soles. Additionally, chickenpox pustules are of varying size due to variations in the timing of pustule eruption: smallpox pustules are all very nearly the same size since the viral effect progresses more uniformly. A variety of laboratory methods are available for detecting chickenpox in evaluation of suspected smallpox cases.|$|E
5|$|The Majorelle Garden, on Avenue Yacoub el Mansour, was at {{one time}} {{the home of the}} {{landscape}} painter Jacques Majorelle. Famed designer Yves Saint Laurent bought and restored the property, which features a stele erected in his memory, and the Museum of Islamic Art, which is housed in a dark blue building. The garden, open to the public since 1947, has a large collection of plants from five continents including cacti, <b>palms</b> <b>and</b> bamboo.|$|E
5|$|The {{monument}} supports 7,000 species, {{one quarter}} of which are endemic. Prominent species include the endangered hawksbill sea turtle, the threatened green sea turtle and the endangered Hawaiian monk seal, the Laysan and Nihoa finches, the Nihoa millerbird, Laysan duck, seabirds such as the Laysan albatross, numerous species of plants including Pritchardia <b>palms,</b> <b>and</b> many species of arthropods. According to the Pew Charitable Trusts, populations of lobster have not recovered from extensive harvesting in the 1980s and 1990s, which is now banned; the remaining fisheries are overfished.|$|E

5|$|Cindy {{prompted}} a hurricane watch and gale warnings for areas extending from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, to Charleston, South Carolina, and a hurricane warning for areas between Beaufort and Georgetown, South Carolina, on July 8. A preliminary alert was issued for naval and marine {{areas in the}} Carolinas from Norfolk, Virginia. Special forecasts from the Weather Bureau office in Columbia, South Carolina were activated on the radio at 16:50 UTC on July 8. Several thousand people evacuated in areas of South Carolina, including Folly Beach, Sullivan's Island, Isle of <b>Palms,</b> <b>and</b> Pawleys Island. The issuance of an emergency flood forecast for Columbia, South Carolina occurred {{as a result of}} Cindy.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{introduces}} his Jamaican cousin Madame Claude to Peter, Joe, and Quagmire {{saying she}} is a psychic. Cleveland offers to have her read their <b>palms</b> <b>and</b> determine past lives they have had. Madame Claude then determines that Joe was once an octopus whose tentacles were bitten off by a shark, and Quagmire was Jack the Ripper. When Claude reads Peter's palm, she discovers that he was Griffin Peterson, the supposed founder of Quahog where the previously-mentioned history of Quahog was a myth. Most of the episode follows {{the story of this}} past life, the main characters therein having the appearance of regular Family Guy characters.|$|E
5|$|Disagreement {{exists as}} to whether Attalea should be {{considered}} a single genus, or a group of related genera. In their 1996 Field Guide to the Palms of the Americas, Andrew Henderson, Gloria Galeano and Rodrigo Bernal combined all the species in the subtribe Attaleinae (as it was then defined) into a single genus, Attalea. In his 1999 Taxonomic Treatment of Palm Subtribe Attaleinae, American botanist Sidney F. Glassman divided the group into five genera—a more narrowly defined Attalea, Orbignya, Maximiliana, Scheelea and Ynesa. Rafäel Govaerts and John Dransfield recognised a single genus in their 2005 World Checklist of <b>Palms,</b> <b>and</b> Jean-Christophe Pintaud continued this usage in his 2008 review of the genus.|$|E

5|$|Lord Howe Island is a {{distinct}} terrestrial ecoregion known as the Lord Howe Island subtropical forests. It {{is part of the}} Australasia ecozone and shares many biotic affinities with Australia, New Guinea, and New Caledonia. Almost half of the island's native plants are endemic and many of the island's unique plants grow on or around the mountain summits where the height has allowed the development of a true cloud forest and many different microhabitats from sealevel to the summits. One of the best known is Howea, an endemic genus of palms (Arecaceae) that are commonly known as kentia <b>palms</b> <b>and</b> make handsome houseplants. Annual exports provide a revenue of over A$2million, providing the only major industry on the island apart from tourism.|$|E
5|$|Tactile ASL (TASL) is {{a variety}} of ASL used {{throughout}} the United States by and with the deaf-blind. It is particularly common among those with Usher's syndrome. This syndrome results in deafness from birth followed by loss of vision later in life; consequently, those with Usher's syndrome often {{grow up in the}} Deaf community using ASL, and later transition to TASL. TASL differs from ASL in that signs are produced by touching the <b>palms,</b> <b>and</b> there are some grammatical differences from standard ASL in order to compensate for the lack of non-manual signing.|$|E
5|$|Triceratops {{teeth were}} {{arranged}} in groups called batteries, of 36 to 40 tooth columns, in {{each side of}} each jaw with 3 to 5 stacked teeth per column, {{depending on the size}} of the animal. This gives a range of 432 to 800 teeth, of which only a fraction were in use at any given time (tooth replacement was continuous and occurred throughout the life of the animal). They functioned by shearing in a vertical to near-vertical orientation. The great size and numerous teeth of Triceratops suggests that they ate large volumes of fibrous plant material, with some suggesting <b>palms</b> <b>and</b> cycads, and others suggesting ferns, which then grew in prairies.|$|E

5|$|Biscayne National Park protects four {{distinct}} ecosystems: {{the shoreline}} mangrove swamp, the shallow waters of Biscayne Bay, the coral limestone keys and the offshore Florida Reef. The shoreline swamps {{of the mainland}} and island margins provide a nursery for larval and juvenile fish, molluscs and crustaceans. The bay waters harbor immature and adult fish, seagrass beds, sponges, soft corals, and manatees. The keys are covered with tropical vegetation including endangered cacti and <b>palms,</b> <b>and</b> their beaches provide nesting grounds for endangered sea turtles. Offshore reefs and waters harbor more than 200 species of fish, pelagic birds, whales and hard corals. Sixteen endangered species including Schaus' swallowtail butterflies, smalltooth sawfish, manatees, and green and hawksbill sea turtles may be observed in the park. Biscayne also has a small population of threatened American crocodiles and a few American alligators.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the close}} {{passage of the}} storm to the Florida Keys, damage in the area was light and {{amounted}} to $175,000. Of this, $125,000 was attributed to structural damage. Hurricane-force winds in the archipelago only lasted 15minutes and gale-force winds occurred over a 5hour span. The brevity of damaging winds limited {{the effects of the}} storm. Most damage was constrained to downed trees, signs, and power poles. Two trailers were overturned, however, and an oil barge sank in the Key West Harbor. Two people drowned after their shrimp boat was destroyed. In and around the Fakahatchee Strand Preserve State Park, Royal <b>Palms,</b> <b>and</b> Royal Poincianas were defoliated by the hurricane's winds. Downed trees and power lines in Collier County temporarily left many customers without phone and electrical service. Residents in nearby Lee Cypress stated that the effects from Isbell were worse than Hurricane Donna which struck the region as a Category4 in September 1960.|$|E
5|$|Nasir al-Dawla's sons contested {{control of}} al-Rahba in the {{aftermath}} of their father's deposition in 969. It ultimately passed to his son Abu Taghlib when his brother and subordinate commander, Hibat-Allah, captured it from Hamdan in a surprise attack. Abu Taghlib had al-Rahba's walls rebuilt. He restored al-Rahba to Hamdan to preempt the possibility of his Buyid enemy, Izz al-Dawla al-Bakhtiyar, forming an alliance with Hamdan to undermine Abu Taghlib. The Hamdanids lost control of al-Rahba in 978, after which it was captured by the Buyid emir 'Adud al-Dawla (r. 949–983). In 991, al-Rahba's inhabitants requested and received a governor assigned by 'Adud's son, Emir Baha' al-Dawla (r. 988–1012). The town was described by Jerusalemite geographer al-Muqaddasi in the late 10th century as being the center of the Euphrates district, located {{on the edge of the}} desert, having a semi-circular layout and being defended by a strong fortress. He also noted that the wider vicinity was characterized by highly irrigated and productive lands, with abundant date <b>palms</b> <b>and</b> quince groves.|$|E
