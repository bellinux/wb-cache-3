40|$|The {{knowledge}} on the <b>Podzols</b> which occur in Portugal is scarce. Besides its morphological characterization, their actual extension and distribution are unknown, and its taxonomy is controversial. Therefore, 22 pedons formed under conditions considered representative {{of those in}} which <b>Podzols</b> mostly occur in the country were selected in the Mata Nacional de Leiria, and their morphological, physical, chemical and mineralogical characteristics were studied. Soils developed in such conditions are both <b>Podzols</b> and Arenossolos sensu WRB 2006, but the latter are clearly predominant. The <b>Podzols</b> frequently show thick albic horizons and incipient spodic horizons; the latter are dusky, but show organic matter (OM) contents close the minimum threshold considered as diagnostic criteria for spodic horizons, and low content in Al and Fe. A wide spectrum of characteristics is observed in the Arenosols. Some of them present profils with morphology close {{to that of the}} <b>Podzols,</b> but with a low illuvial acumulationb of OM (and Fe e Al components), and the others (the predominant Arenosols in the study area) do not present intergrade characteristics, although they can show expressed albic horizons.

25|$|Podzolized, brunisolic, luvisolic, gleysolic, and regosolic (immature) {{soils are}} typical of those {{supporting}} white spruce throughout {{the range of the}} species (Nienstaedt 1957). Soils supporting white spruce are most commonly Alfisols or Inceptisols (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). In the <b>podzol</b> region of Wisconsin, white spruce occurs on loam podzols, podzolized gley loams, strongly podzolized clays, gley-podzol clays, stream-bottom soils, and wood peat (Wilde et al. 1949). Moist sandy loams also support good growth (Harlow and Harrar 1950). On sandy podzols (Wilde et al. 1949), it is usually a minor species (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). Good development occurs on moist alluvium (Seeley, cited by Nienstaedt 1957; Jeffrey 1961, 1964; Lacate et al. 1965; Viereck 1973) on the banks of streams and borders of swamps (Sargent 1898, Kenety 1917, Rowe 1972). White spruce makes good growth on well-drained lacustrine soils in Alberta Mixedwoods (Heger 1971), on moderately-well-drained clay loams in Saskatchewan (Kabzems 1971), and on melanized loams and clays (with sparse litter and a dark-coloured organically-enriched mineral horizon) in the Algoma district of Ontario (Wilde et al. 1954).|$|E

40|$|Two {{examples}} of widespread relict soils in high mountains of different climatic environments are presented. In the European Alps above the timberline, <b>Podzols</b> are typical soils on silicatic rocks. The <b>Podzols</b> {{seem to be}} relicts of an Early Holocene climatic optimum, when {{the slopes of the}} alpine and lower subnival ecotone had been stabilized by high reaching alpine meadows, probably for a period of several thousand years. From 5, 000 - 6, 000 C y BP on, the <b>Podzols</b> were partly fossilized by solifluction lobes. Due to intensified periglacial processes as a consequence of climate change, the formation of <b>Podzols</b> has not been possible at these altitudes during the Upper Holocene.

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of <b>podzols</b> in lateritic landscapes {{of the upper}} Amazon basin contributes to the exportation of organic carbon and associated metals in the black waters of the Negro River watershed. We have investigated the distribution of FeIII in the clay-size fraction of eight organic-rich horizons of waterlogged plateau <b>podzols,</b> to unravel the weathering conditions and mechanisms that control its transfer to the rivers. The speciation and amount of FeIII stored in residual mineral phases of laterites, or bound to organic compounds of weakly and well-expressed <b>podzols,</b> were determined by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy combined with chemical analyses. Reducing conditions restrict the production of organo-Fe complexes in the subsoil B-horizons of waterlogged <b>podzols</b> {{and most of the}} Fe 2 + released from the dissolution of Fe-oxides is exported to the rivers via the perched groundwater. However, significant amounts of diluted FeIII bound to organic ligands (FeIII OM) and nano Fe-oxides are produced at the margin of the depression in the topsoil A horizons of weakly expressed <b>podzols</b> due to shorter periods of anoxia. The downward translocation of organically bound metals from topsoil A to subsoil B-horizons of <b>podzols</b> occurs in shorter distances for Fe than it does for Al. This separation of secondary Fe species from Al species is attributed to the physical fractionation of their organic carriers in texture contrasted B-horizons of <b>podzols,</b> {{as well as to the}} effect of pH on metal speciation in soil solutions and metal binding onto soil organic ligands (mostly for Al). This leads us to consider the topsoil A horizons of weakly expressed <b>podzols,</b> as well as the subsoil Bh horizon of better-expressed ones, as the main sources for the transfer of FeIII OM to the rivers. The concentration of FeIII OM rises from soil sources to river colloids, suggesting drastic biogeochemical changes in more oxygenated black waters of the Negro River watershed. The contribution of soil organic matter to the transfer of Fe to rivers is likely at the origin of the peculiar Fe isotope pattern recently recognized in podzolic environments...|$|R
