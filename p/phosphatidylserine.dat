5|$|In {{addition}} to protein- and solution-mediated processes, {{it is also}} possible for lipid bilayers to participate directly in signaling. A classic example of this is phosphatidylserine-triggered phagocytosis. Normally, <b>phosphatidylserine</b> is asymmetrically distributed in the cell membrane and is present only on the interior side. During programmed cell death a protein called a scramblase equilibrates this distribution, displaying <b>phosphatidylserine</b> on the extracellular bilayer face. The presence of <b>phosphatidylserine</b> then triggers phagocytosis to remove the dead or dying cell.|$|E
5|$|The MAM is {{enriched in}} enzymes {{involved}} in lipid biosynthesis, such as <b>phosphatidylserine</b> synthase on the ER face and <b>phosphatidylserine</b> decarboxylase on the mitochondrial face. Because mitochondria are dynamic organelles constantly undergoing fission and fusion events, they require a constant and well-regulated supply of phospholipids for membrane integrity. But mitochondria {{are not only}} a destination for the phospholipids they finish synthesis of; rather, this organelle also {{plays a role in}} inter-organelle trafficking of the intermediates and products of phospholipid biosynthetic pathways, ceramide and cholesterol metabolism, and glycosphingolipid anabolism.|$|E
5|$|Examples of glycerophospholipids {{found in}} {{biological}} membranes are phosphatidylcholine (also known as PC, GPCho or lecithin), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE or GPEtn) and <b>phosphatidylserine</b> (PS or GPSer). In addition to {{serving as a}} primary component of cellular membranes and binding sites for intra- and intercellular proteins, some glycerophospholipids in eukaryotic cells, such as phosphatidylinositols and phosphatidic acids are either precursors of or, themselves, membrane-derived second messengers. Typically, {{one or both of}} these hydroxyl groups are acylated with long-chain fatty acids, but there are also alkyl-linked and 1Z-alkenyl-linked (plasmalogen) glycerophospholipids, as well as dialkylether variants in archaebacteria.|$|E
40|$|The 93 C labeled lipid 1 [l 2 ̆ 019 - 93 C]DPPS-NH 2 ̆ 0842 ̆ 07 a and its metal salts {{were used}} to {{unambiguously}} assign all carbonyl vibrations in the infrared spectrum of <b>phosphatidylserines.</b> It is shown that the C=O stretching band at 1741 cm 2 ̆ 07 b 9 of <b>phosphatidylserines</b> previously assigned to the sn- 1 C=O vibration contains contributions from both the sn- 1 and the sn- 2 carbonyls. The C=O stretching band at frequencies between 1715 and 1730 cm 2 ̆ 07 b 9 previously assigned to the sn- 2 C=O vibration also contains contributions from both carbonyl groups. The frequency dependence observed with the ester carbonyls primarily reflects hydrogen bonding and the polarity of the immediate vicinity. Conformational changes are accounted for in terms of frequency shifts if the conformational change involves the disposition of the C=O groups and in turn the hydrogen bonding properties. The infrared spectra of phospholipids dispersed in aqueous medium in the liquid crystalline state are inconsistent with a simple phospholipid conformation, e. g., with a conformation as found in the single-crystal structure of 1, 2 -dimyristoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine and 1, 2 -dilauroyl-rucphosphatidylethanolamine. The spectra support the hypothesis proposed earlier (Hauser et al., Biochemistry, 1988) {{on the basis of}} existing single-crystal phospholipid structures and NMR evidence. The hypothesis states that several conformations are present in liquid crystalline phospholipid dispersions. The interconversion between these conformers takes place at rates that are fast on the NMR time scale but slow on the infrared time scale giving rise to motionally averaged NMR spectra but clearly discernible component infrared spectra. Changes in the infrared spectra observed for aqueous dispersions of <b>phosphatidylserines</b> induced at the order-disorder phase transition and upon adding cations such as Li 2 ̆ 07 a, Mg 22 ̆ 07 a, and Ca 22 ̆ 07 a are interpreted in terms of changes in hydrogen bonding and in turn as conformational changes.

5|$|In many {{naturally}} occurring bilayers, the compositions {{of the inner}} and outer membrane leaflets are different. In human red blood cells, the inner (cytoplasmic) leaflet is composed mostly of phosphatidylethanolamine, <b>phosphatidylserine</b> and phosphatidylinositol and its phosphorylated derivatives. By contrast, the outer (extracellular) leaflet is based on phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin and a variety of glycolipids, In some cases, this asymmetry is based on where the lipids are made in the cell and reflects their initial orientation. The biological functions of lipid asymmetry are imperfectly understood, although it is clear that it is used in several different situations. For example, when a cell undergoes apoptosis, the phosphatidylserine— normally localised to the cytoplasmic leaflet— is transferred to the outer surface: There, it is recognised by a macrophage that then actively scavenges the dying cell.|$|E

Phospholipids make up approximately 30% of the total lipid weight of MFGM, the three most prominent being sphingomyelin (SM), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which together represent up to 85% of total phospholipids. Phospholipids and sphingolipids play central roles in cerebral neurogenesis and migration during fetal development, as well as promoting neuronal growth, differentiation, and synaptogenesis {{during the first year}} of life. Other important polar lipids present in the membrane include the glycerophospholipids <b>phosphatidylserine</b> (PS) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), as well as gangliosides (GG), which are sphingolipids containing sialic acid and an oligosaccharide side chain.

40|$|The lipid {{composition}} of the human lens is distinct from most other tissues {{in that it is}} high in dihydrosphingomyelin and the most abundant glycerophospholipids in the lens are unusual 1 -O-alkyl-ether linked phosphatidylethanolamines and <b>phosphatidylserines.</b> In this study, desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) mass spectrometry-imaging was used to determine the distribution of these lipids in the human lens along with other lipids including, ceramides, ceramide- 1 -phosphates, and lyso 1 -O-alkyl ethers. To achieve this, 25 μm lens slices were mounted onto glass slides and analyzed using a linear ion-trap mass spectrometer equipped with a custom-built, 2 -D automated DESI source. In contrast to other tissues that have been previously analyzed by DESI, the presence of a strong acid in the spray solvent was required to desorb lipids directly from lens tissue. Distinctive distributions were observed for [M + H]+ ions arising from each lipid class. Of particular interest were ionized 1 -O-alkyl phosphatidylethanolamines and <b>phosphatidylserines,</b> PE (18 : 1 e/ 18 : 1), and PS (18 : 1 e/ 18 : 1), which were found in a thin ring in the outermost region of the lens. This distribution was confirmed by quantitative analysis of lenses that were sectioned into four distinct regions (outer, barrier, inner, and core), extracted and analyzed by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. DESI-imaging also revealed a complementary distribution for the structurally-related lyso 1 -O-alkyl phosphatidylethanolamine, LPE (18 : 1 e), which was localized closer to the centre of the lens.

5|$|In recent years, {{evidence}} has emerged showing that lipid signaling {{is a vital}} part of the cell signaling. Lipid signaling may occur via activation of G protein-coupled or nuclear receptors, and members of several different lipid categories have been identified as signaling molecules and cellular messengers. These include sphingosine-1-phosphate, a sphingolipid derived from ceramide that is a potent messenger molecule involved in regulating calcium mobilization, cell growth, and apoptosis; diacylglycerol (DAG) and the phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs), involved in calcium-mediated activation of protein kinase C; the prostaglandins, which are one type of fatty-acid derived eicosanoid involved in inflammation and immunity; the steroid hormones such as estrogen, testosterone and cortisol, which modulate a host of functions such as reproduction, metabolism and blood pressure; and the oxysterols such as 25-hydroxy-cholesterol that are liver X receptor agonists. <b>Phosphatidylserine</b> lipids are known to be involved in signaling for the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells or pieces of cells. They accomplish this by being exposed to the extracellular face of the cell membrane after the inactivation of flippases which place them exclusively on the cytosolic side and the activation of scramblases, which scramble the orientation of the phospholipids. After this occurs, other cells recognize the phosphatidylserines and phagocytosize the cells or cell fragments exposing them.|$|E

30|$|Apoptosis has {{important}} functions for tissue homeostasis and is dysregulated {{in a variety}} of diseases [1, 2]. Whereas apoptosis is increased in cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders, insufficient apoptosis occurs in autoimmune diseases, and the pronounced loss of apoptosis is a hallmark of cancer tissue [1, 2]. On the other hand, efficient cancer therapies like chemotherapy, radiation, or antiangiogenic treatment induce apoptosis in the tumor tissue. Thus, the detection of apoptosis, especially by noninvasive imaging technologies, is potentially of great interest for disease diagnosis, monitoring of the disease course, as well as treatment response. One characteristic event in apoptosis is the externalization of <b>phosphatidylserines</b> [PS] at the plasma membrane. The binding of the multifunction protein Annexin V to PS has been used for diagnostic purposes [2].

Three weeks of exercise training decrease specific molecular species of phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylcholines (PC), phosphatidylethanolamines (PE), and <b>phosphatidylserines</b> (PS) in scWAT and increase specific molecular species of PC and PE in BAT. Exercise also decreases most triacylglycerols (TAGs) in scWAT and BAT. In summary, exercise-induced changes to the scWAT and BAT lipidome are highly specific to certain molecular lipid species, indicating that changes in tissue lipid content reflect selective remodeling in scWAT and BAT of both phospholipids and glycerol lipids in response to exercise training, thus providing a comprehensive resource for future studies of lipid metabolism pathways...|$|R

This high-throughput method significantly reduced sample handling time and increase efficiency compared to glass-glass homogenising. Furthermore, replacing chloroform with MTBE is safer (less carcinogenic/toxic), with lipids dissolving in the upper phase, allowing for easier pipetting {{and the potential for}} automation (i. e. robotics). Both methods were applied to the analysis of human occipital cortex.

25|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which erythrocytes containing abnormal hemoglobins, or are G6PD deficient, are partially protected against P. falciparum infections are not fully understood, {{although there has been}} no shortage of suggestions. During the peripheral blood stage of replication malaria parasites have a high rate of oxygen consumption and ingest large amounts of hemoglobin. It is likely that HbS in endocytic vesicles is deoxygenated, polymerizes and is poorly digested. In red cells containing abnormal hemoglobins, or which are G6PD deficient, oxygen radicals are produced, and malaria parasites induce additional oxidative stress. This can result in changes in red cell membranes, including translocation of <b>phosphatidylserine</b> to their surface, followed by macrophage recognition and ingestion. The authors suggest that this mechanism is likely to occur earlier in abnormal than in normal red cells, thereby restricting multiplication in the former. In addition, binding of parasitized sickle cells to endothelial cells is significantly decreased because of an altered display of P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein-1 (PfMP-1). This protein is the parasite’s main cytoadherence ligand and virulence factor on the cell surface. During the late stages of parasite replication red cells are adherent to venous endothelium, and inhibiting this attachment could suppress replication.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{mechanisms}} {{behind this}} complex {{sequence of events}} are still a matter of debate. To simplify the system and allow more definitive study, many experiments have been performed in vitro with synthetic lipid vesicles. These {{studies have shown that}} divalent cations {{play a critical role in}} the fusion process by binding to negatively charged lipids such as <b>phosphatidylserine,</b> phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin. One role on these ions in the fusion process is to shield the negative charge on the surface of the bilayer, diminishing electrostatic repulsion and allowing the membranes to approach each other. This is clearly not the only role, however, since there is an extensively documented difference in the ability of Mg2+ versus Ca2+ to induce fusion. Although Mg2+ will induce extensive aggregation it will not induce fusion, while Ca2+ induces both. It has been proposed that this discrepancy is due to a difference in extent of dehydration. Under this theory, calcium ions bind more strongly to charged lipids, but less strongly to water. The resulting displacement of calcium for water destabilizes the lipid-water interface and promotes intimate interbilayer contact. A recently proposed alternative hypothesis is that the binding of calcium induces a destabilizing lateral tension. Whatever the mechanism of calcium-induced fusion, the initial interaction is clearly electrostatic, since zwitterionic lipids are not susceptible to this effect.|$|E
25|$|Human ABC {{transporters}} {{are involved}} in several diseases that arise from polymorphisms in ABC genes and rarely due to complete loss of function of single ABC proteins. Such diseases include Mendelian diseases and complex genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis, adrenoleukodystrophy, Stargardt disease, Tangier disease, immune deficiencies, progressive familial intraheptic cholestasis, Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Pseudoxanthoma elasticum, persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy due to focal adenomatous hyperplasia, X-linked sideroblastosis and anemia, age-related macular degeneration, familial hypoapoproteinemia, Retinitis pigmentosum, cone rod dystrophy, and others. The human ABCB (MDR/TAP) family is responsible for multiple drug resistance (MDR) against a variety of structurally unrelated drugs. ABCB1 or MDR1 P-glycoprotein is also involved in other biological processes for which lipid transport is the main function. It is found to mediate the secretion of the steroid aldosterone by the adrenals, and its inhibition blocked the migration of dendritic immune cells, possibly related to the outward transport of the lipid platelet activating factor (PAF). It has also been reported that ABCB1 mediates transport of cortisol and dexamethasone, but not of progesterone in ABCB1 transfected cells. MDR1 can also transport cholesterol, short-chain and long-chain analogs of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), <b>phosphatidylserine</b> (PS), sphingomyelin (SM), and glucosylceramide (GlcCer). Multispecific transport of diverse endogenous lipids through the MDR1 transporter can possibly affect the transbilayer distribution of lipids, in particular of species normally predominant on the inner plasma membrane leaflet such as PS and PE.|$|E
40|$|Tacrine is an {{acetylcholinesterase}} inhibitor used as cognitive enhancer in Alzheimer's disease treatment. However, the low therapeutic {{efficiency and}} {{the high incidence of}} side effects have limited its clinical use. In the present study, the molecular mechanisms underlying the brain activity of tacrine and two novel tacrine analogues (T 1, T 2) were approached focusing on three aspects: i) effects on brain cholinesterase activity; ii) perturbations on electron transport chain enzymes activities of non-synaptic brain mitochondria; iii) the role of mitochondrial lipidome changes induced by these compounds on the mitochondrial bioenergetics. The brain effects were evaluated 18 hours after a single dose (75. 6 moles/Kg) administration of tacrine or tacrine-analogues. The three compounds promoted a significant reduction of brain acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activities. Additionally, tacrine showed to be more efficient in brain acetylcholinesterase inhibition than T 2 tacrine-analogue and less active than T 1 tacrine-analogue, while the butyrylcholinesterase inhibition follows the order: T 1 > T 2 > tacrine. The studies with nonsynaptic brain mitochondria show that all the compounds studied disturbed the brain mitochondrial bioenergetics mainly by inhibition of complex I activity. Furthermore, the activity of complex IV is also affected by tacrine and T 1 treatments while FoF 1 ATPase is only affected by tacrine. Therefore, the compounds toxicity to the brain mitochondria, that follow the order: tacrine >> T 1 > T 2, does not correlate with their ability to inhibit brain cholinesterase enzymes. Lipidomics approaches show that phosphatidylethanolamine is the most abundant phospholipid class in non-synaptic brain mitochondria and cardiolipin present greater diversity of molecular species. Tacrine induced significant perturbations in mitochondrial phospholipid profile detected by changes in relative abundance of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol and cardiolipin and by the presence of oxidized <b>phosphatidylserines.</b> Additionally, in both T 1 and T 2 groups, the lipid content and molecular composition of brain mitochondria phospholipids are perturbed in less extent than in the tacrine group. The abnormalities in cardiolipin content and the amount of oxidized <b>phosphatidylserines</b> were associated with significant reductions in mitochondrial enzymes activities, mainly complex I.

During the phospholipid profiling of the macrophage-like RAW 264. 7 cells, we identified dozens of rare or previously uncharacterized phospholipids, including ether-linked PIs, PSs, and glycerophosphatidic acids, PTs, and PCs and PTs containing very long polyunsaturated fatty acids. Additionally, large numbers of phospholipids containing at least one odd carbon fatty acid were identified. Using the same methodology, we also identified many of the same species of glycerophospholipids in resident peritoneal macrophages, foam cells, and murine bone marrow derived macrophages...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{hydration}} isotherms of the {{negatively charged}} phospholipids, egg phosphatidic acid, bovine heart cardiolipin and two <b>phosphatidylserines</b> {{as well as}} one positively charged phospholipid, 1, 2 -dioleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -ethylphosphocholine, have been obtained gravimetrically. The presence of an electrical charge on these phospholipids does not, in itself, determine whether the water binding to the phospholipids is ‘strong’ or ‘weak’. Interestingly, hysteresis effects were present for certain charged phospholipids suggesting some rearrangement of the lipid molecular organization upon hydration and dehydration, perhaps due to the presence of the ionizable moiety. The hydration isotherms of the charged phospholipids have been analyzed by BET theory, although, of the charged lipids studied, all may not be amenable to the application of BET theory. The hydration isotherms and the resulting parameters obtained from the BET analysis are compared to those found previously for zwitterionic phospholipids, especially egg phosphatidylcholine. The water adsorption characteristics of phospholipids are found to depend mainly on the total head-group structure including the presence of hydrophobic groups as well as electrical charge on the head-group...|$|R
