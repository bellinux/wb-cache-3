50|$|Contrary to many {{predictions}} made {{prior to}} the Aswan High Dam construction and publications that followed, that the prevalence of bilharzia (schistosomiasis) would increase, it did not. This assumption did {{not take into account}} the extent of <b>perennial</b> <b>irrigation</b> that was already present throughout Egypt decades before the high dam closure. By the 1950s only a small proportion of Upper Egypt had not been converted from basin (low transmission) to perennial (high transmission) irrigation. Expansion of <b>perennial</b> <b>irrigation</b> systems in Egypt did not depend on the high dam. In fact, within 15 years of the high dam closure there was solid evidence that biharzia was declining in Upper Egypt. S. haematobium has since disappeared altogether. Suggested reasons for this include improvements in irrigation practice. In the Nile Delta, schistosomaisis had been highly endemic, with prevalence in the villages 50% or higher for almost a century before. This was a consequence of the conversion of the Delta to <b>perennial</b> <b>irrigation</b> to grow long staple cotton by the British. This has changed.

Menpulam yielded rich produce {{on a variety of}} crops, but Pinpulam was cultivated only with dry crops due to limited irrigation facilities. The yield from Vanpulam was limited, while Kalarnilam was unfit for cultivation.

40|$|Groundwater is {{a crucial}} source of {{irrigation}} for the farmers in Gauribidanur taluk to eke out the living {{since there is no}} other <b>perennial</b> source of <b>irrigation.</b> Currently the irrigation wells in the riparian areas of uttara Pinakini River are seriously threatened due to excessive sand extraction, which in turn affects the groundwater recharge. This has manifested in increase in proportion of well failure. It is imperative that sand mining is seriously (negative externality) affecting the interests of the economy of riparian farmers in this river basin. This calls for a serious, effective and efficient implementation of regulation of sand mining for the benefit of both agriculture and civil works. Currently sand extraction is permitted up to three feet by remitting a royalty of Rs. 45 per truckload of sand to the Department of Mines and Geology. On the other hand, however, sand miners are excavating even up to 40 feet in Uttara pinakini stream. Thus, department of mines and geology has to seriously monitor the sand mining activity for the overall benefit of society. The estimated negative externality per irrigation well in the Gauribidanur SMA was Rs. 4186 per year. There are about 8000 irrigation wells located in the riparian areas of the Gauribidanur river stream, where sand mining is actively being undertaken. Thus, the total estimated negative externality is Rs. 3, 34, 88, 000. The total estimated sand accumulated in uttara pinakini river stream is 1, 74, 00, 000 cubic meter in fifteen years, of which 61 percent was extracted, constituting 1, 06, 14, 000 cubic meter or 37, 14, 90, 000 cft in fifteen years(6). Therefore annual sand extracted is 2, 47, 66, 000 cft imposing externality of Rs 1. 35 per cft or Rs. 540 per load. In order to conserve the sand resources, along the riparian areas, this environmental cost Rs 540 per load should be imposed to internalise the pressure on this natural resource in the market price of sand. Imposition of the pigouvian tax of Rs. 540 per truck load of sand transported will create a corpus fund with the Government’s Department of Mines and Geology with which (i) the farmers possessing irrigation wells which have failed due to sand mining would be compensated on the basis of loss in net returns which would result from mining a truck load of sand.

40|$|Ungauged {{catchments}} can {{be found}} {{in many parts of the}} world, but particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Information collected in a gauged catchment and its regionalisation to ungauged areas is crucial for water resources assessment. Especially farmers in semi-arid areas are in need of such information. Inter and intra-seasonal rainfall variability is large in these areas, and farmers depend more and more on additional surface and groundwater resources for their crop production. As a result, understanding of the key hydrological processes, and determination of the frequencies and magnitudes of stream flows, is very important for local food production. This is particularly true for the ungauged Makanya catchment in Tanzania, which is the subject of this study. In the absence of long-term hydrological data, hydrological processes have been studied through a multi-method approach. Regular rainfall and runoff measurement devices were installed in a nested catchment approach. High spatial and temporal resolution data have been collected over a period of 2 years to capture all the hydrological processes. Spring samples have been taken to identify groundwater flow systems. Hydrograph separation with hydrochemical data has been performed to identify and quantify the origins and flow pathways of the water during flood flows. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) has been used to map the subsurface structure at selected sites. Finally, a conceptual model has been developed to test the hypothesised conceptualisation of the flow paths. Agricultural practices by farmers in the catchment vary as a function of location as they are influenced by the local climate, water resources availability and soil type. Three zones with distinct features have been identified within the study area. In the highlands, it is cooler, rainfall is more abundant and there are <b>perennial</b> springs. Here <b>irrigation</b> is practiced as supplementary irrigation in the wet season and as full irrigation during the dry season. In the midlands only supplementary irrigation is practiced using the remainder of the perennial streams coming from the highlands. Here the high probability of occurrence of dry spells requires supplementary irrigation. In the lowlands, base flow has dried up and spate-irrigation is practiced during the rainy season, whereby flash floods are diverted from the main river onto the farm land. In the highlands, the occurrence of perennial springs is defined by the geology. These springs discharge a substantial amount of water. In the midlands, few springs exist, yielding a substantially lower amount of discharge, with poorer quality. Abundance of spring water from the highlands is both used in the highlands and the midlands for irrigation. However, due to the many diversions, the rivers do no longer reach the outlet of the catchment, as they do not exceed the infiltration capacity of the alluvium. Only large flash floods reach the spateirrigation system in the lowlands. Two types of floods have been analysed in the catchment, induced by different types of rainfall. High intensity rainfall can generate flash floods which reach the spate-irrigation system. Smaller floods infiltrate into the alluvium before reaching the spate-irrigation system. It has been observed that during small floods, the vast majority of the flood originates from groundwater (> 90 percent). During an extreme event, the groundwater contribution is still about 50 percent of the total flow, increasing the outflow from the groundwater reservoir a 100 -fold during the peak flow and causing a substantial base flow increase after the event. The time of concentration is extremely short, within one to two hours the flood peak reaches the outlet of the catchment flowing into the spate-irrigation system. The rainfall during the March 2006 event was such an extreme event, with intensities as high as 50 mm hr- 1, while the entire event lasted only 4 - 5 hours. During this event, rainfall intensities exceeded the infiltration capacity of the soils and overland flow was common. The flows exceeded also the absorption capacity of the alluvium of the main valley of the catchment, replenishing the local aquifer and feeding the downstream spate-irrigation system. The temporal resolution of the observed data is 15 min. This level of detail was necessary to capture the rapid catchment response during peak flows. The observation data, unfortunately is not complete as extreme events damaged the structures and affected the reliability of the observations. Moreover, 7 out of 10 instruments were lost, stolen or damaged which hampered the data collection. A conceptual hydrological model has been developed to test the rainfall-runoff hypotheses. The model is able to model in a process-based fashion the flows at the foot of the mountain, incorporating the observed hydrological processes. The model yields good results for a simulation of a 2 -year period at hourly time step (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency: 0. 79 and Log Nash- Sutcliffe: 0. 90). This model contains a large number of parameters, of which several parameters could be identified from the data. However, automatic optimisation of the remaining parameters is hampered by equifinality. Hence, the strategy chosen is step-wise calibration using multiple performance criteria judging hydrograph performance visually. If the hydrological model would be used for upscaling farming practices, then one should realise that the hydrological processes in the valley of the catchment are different from the highland processes and need to be studied in further detail before the model can be upscaled to the catchment level. The current hydrological and water resources situation, as in many parts of Africa, is also a result of anthropogenic influences. Increased water usage in the upper parts of the catchment generated the need for agreements between highland and midland water users. No agreements are in existence between these two groups and the lowland farmers. With the base flow no longer reaching Makanya, the farmers were forced to change their irrigation practices. Changes in land use in the upstream parts have also impacted on the hydrological processes. However, with a lack of historical data, we were unable to quantify this. The downstream farmers are not solely negatively affected, as flash floods generated in the highlands reach Makanya, replenish the unsaturated zone and local groundwater bodies and deposit fertile sediments. Currently, there is a balance between the upstream and downstream farmers, whereby yields are produced by each system. However, it is unsure how future increases in water requirements will affect this balance. WatermanagementCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
50|$|<b>Perennial</b> <b>irrigation</b> was {{practiced in}} the Mesopotamian plain whereby crops were {{regularly}} watered throughout the growing season by coaxing water through a matrix of small channels formed in the field. Ancient Egyptians practiced Basin irrigation using the flooding of the Nile to inundate land plots which had been surrounded by dykes. The flood water was held until the fertile sediment had settled before the surplus was returned to the watercourse. There is evidence of the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Amenemhet III in the twelfth dynasty (about 1800 BCE) using the natural lake of the Faiyum Oasis as a reservoir to store surpluses of water for use during the dry seasons. The lake swelled annually from flooding of the Nile.The Ancient Nubians developed a form of irrigation by using a waterwheel-like device called a sakia.

The increase was brought about both by irrigating {{what used to be}} desert and by bringing under cultivation of 385,000 ha that were previously used as flood retention basins. About half a million families were settled on these new lands. In particular the area under rice and sugar cane cultivation increased. In addition, about 1 million feddan (420,000 hectares), mostly in Upper Egypt, were converted from flood irrigation with only one crop per year to <b>perennial</b> <b>irrigation</b> allowing two or more crops per year. On other previously irrigated land, yields increased because water could be made available at critical low-flow periods. For example, wheat yields in Egypt tripled between 1952 and 1991 and better availability of water contributed to this increase. Most of the 32 km³ of freshwater, or almost 40 percent of the average flow of the Nile that were previously lost to the sea every year could be put to beneficial use. While about 10 km³ of the water saved is lost due to evaporation in Lake Nasser, the amount of water available for irrigation still increased by 22 km³.

The best varieties were selected among new ones for the complex of traits, they included ‘Elegance’ from the Great Britain, ‘Gercules’ from Ukraine (both are dessert grapes), ‘Elsanta’ from Holland (for universal use), ‘Alba’ from Italia (as raw material). The highly adaptive and productive ‘Istochnik’ and ‘Festyvalna romashka’ varieties (as raw material) are recommended for the north regions. Conclusions. In the context of profound climatic change, high-profitable cultivation of mid-ripening varieties and a strawberry as such in the Northern Forest-Steppe zone is expedient under controlled conditions – in high film tunnels, in hot-houses and under <b>perennial</b> <b>irrigation</b> that already has become the European tendency...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Schistosoma haematobium–related {{morbidity}} was {{studied in}} the <b>perennial</b> <b>irrigation</b> area of Office du Niger and the small reservoirs area of Plateau Dogon in Mali. Questionnaire, clinical, parasitologic, and ultrasound examination {{data were collected from}} 1, 041 individuals at the baseline survey in 1991; 705 were re-examined one year after treatment. At baseline, the overall prevalence of S. haematobium infection was 55. 2 %; half of those infected had no clinical symptoms and 30 % had pathologic lesions. Both infection and morbidity were more frequent in children than in adults, with a peak prevalence at 7 – 14 years of age. The rates of lesions were more than twice as high in those heavily infected as in lightly infected individuals. Reagent strip testing for microhematuria was more sensitive in detecting individuals with pathologic lesions than in detecting individuals with infection. One year after treatment with praziquantel, more than 80 % of the urinary tract lesions had cleared. It is concluded that S. haema-tobium-related morbidity is frequent in Mali, but passive case detection for treatment would not cover a great deal of early stages of the disease; active intervention using reagent strip testing for microhematuria at the most peripheral levels would be an efficient system for morbidity control and monitoring of control operations. Schistosomiasis haematobium is widely distributed in Mali. According to an unpublished report of the Schistoso-miasis Control Program, one in every four of the total pop...|$|E
40|$|The {{difficult}} environs of the Upper Indus Plains inhibited {{any large}} occupance of the region, which {{until late in}} the 19 tk century possessed much idle wasteland, sparsely peopled riverine tracts, and a few urban centres at trade nodes. The extension of <b>perennial</b> <b>Irrigation</b> and colonization with planned new settlements followed, leading to the modernization of the economy and growth of urban centres in number and size. The development of new town morphology brought in a phase of change which is current in present day urban and intra-urban structures. The analysis has been directed towards the development of some interpretive ideas and hypotheses regarding overall societal change and urban growth in the region, A multivariate analysis of various indicators of urbanism including agro-economic indices, for the sixteen administrative districts under study is carried out: modernization and urbanization are shown {{to be related to the}} development of irrigation potentials and consequent economic growth in various parts of the region, A further study of the thirty eight urban centres of more than 20, 000 population shows greater urban activity in the towns in the first colony districts and a greater rate of change in the towns belonging to the areas of later and current developments. A study of five representative individual townscapes shows the phases of change in urban morphology, Rectilinear street patterns and planned layout of modern housing, business, community service and administrative premises are becoming distinct features;. The establishment of modern manufacturing units has brought new functions, employment opportunities and industrial suburbs to many urban centres, A comparison of the urban growth characteristics of this region is made with the developing world, especially those of the Middle East, Southeast Asia and the Subcontinent as a whole, It is shown that resource development in the Upper Indus Plains has lead to a distinctive type of urban growth...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSchistosomiasis is a {{parasitic}} disease caused by blood flukes (Trematodes) {{of the genus}} Schistosoma (S.). It is well documented that schistosomiasis haematobium was endemic in Ancient Egypt. Infection was diagnosed in mummies 3000, 4000 and 5000 years old. Scott {{was the first to}} describe the pattern of schistosomiasis infection in Egypt. Schistosomiasis haematobium was highly prevalent (60 %) both in the Nile Delta and Nile Valley South of Cairo in districts of <b>perennial</b> <b>irrigation</b> while it was low (6 %) in districts of basin irrigation. Schistosoma mansoni infected 60 % of the population in the Northern and Eastern parts of the Nile Delta and only 6 % in the Southern part. Neither S. mansoni cases nor its snail intermediate host were found in the Nile Valley South of Cairo. The building of the Aswan High Dam -which was completed in 1967 – did not cause any increase in schistosomiasis prevalence. In 1990, a study conducted in nine governorates of Egypt confirmed the change in the pattern of schistosomiasis transmission in the Delta. There was an overall reduction in S. mansoni prevalence while Schistosoma haematobium had continued to disappear. In Middle and Upper Egypt there was consistent reduction in the prevalence of S. haematobium except in Sohag, Qena, and Aswan governorates. However, foci of S. mansoni were detected in Giza, Fayoum, Menya and Assiut. All schistosomiasis control projects implemented in Egypt from 1953 to 1985 adopted the strategy of transmission control and were based mainly on snail control supplemented by anti-bilharzial chemotherapy. In 1997, the National Schistosomiasis Control Program (NSCP) was launched in the Nile Delta. It adopted morbidity control strategy with Praziquantel mass treatment as the main component. In 1996, before the NSCP, 168 villages had S. mansoni prevalence > 30 %, 324 villages 20 – 30 % and 654 villages 10 – 20 %. By the end of 2010, in the whole country only 29 villages had prevalence > 3 % and none had more than 10 %...|$|E
