Art historians are unsure if his style became progressively more or less influenced by Netherlandish art.

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{seeks to}} analyse the current poverty {{situation}} and poverty alleviation {{efforts of the}} NGOs in Bangladesh with emphasis on the impacts of two NGO programmes in two villages of Barisal district. Design/methodology/approach – This research has employed both qualitative and quantitative approaches. The research has primarily used first-hand empirical data. In order to substantiate primary data, relevant secondary information has also been used. Data were collected through household survey by applying both open- and closed-ended questionnaires. With a view to analysing data, inferential as well as descriptive statistics have been applied. Findings – The findings revealed that the economic condition of the poor in the study areas has not improved much when judged against some selected indicators, namely, income, food and non-food expenditure, productive and non-productive asset, food security, and employment creation. The Foster Greer Thorbecke index shows {{that the majority of}} the NGO beneficiaries remained below the poverty line in terms of income and the overwhelming majority of them remained below the underemployment line (less than 260 days of work in a year). The regression analysis shows that the income of the households is determined by landholding size, family labour, days suffered from morbidities and employment opportunity. The qualitative data on the perception of beneficiaries on the causes of poverty endorse this finding. Originality/value – Controversies over the issue of widespread poverty in Bangladesh have been revolving among the government, NGOs and the donor agencies as well. NGOs have been claiming the entire success of the economic wellbeing made to the rural poor. However, this study has directly challenged their claims by casting an empirical lens on the impact of their interventions. This study has detected the <b>paucities</b> <b>of</b> the NGO interventions and gaps between their objectives and their achievement. Bangladesh, Government agencies, Poverty, Rural regions...|$|R

40|$|Accounts of the {{evolution}} of human language must, by their very nature, express claims of a historical sort: claims about why, when, where or how human language emerged and/or developed in some distant past.

In modern work on language evolution, however, scholars have come up with various strategies aimed at lessening or even solving this problem <b>of</b> evidential <b>paucity.</b> One <b>of</b> these approaches starts from the assumption that language evolution can be studied by examining other phenomena about which there is direct evidence.

The discussion is guided by three research questions, grounded within an economic framework. First, are private schools more efficient than public schools?

40|$|Abridged] We {{present an}} {{extensive}} suite of terrestrial planet formation simulations that allows quantitative {{analysis of the}} stochastic late stages of planet formation. We quantify the feeding zone width, Delta a, as the mass-weighted standard deviation of the initial semi-major axes of the planetary embryos and planetesimals {{that make up the}} final planet. The size of a planet's feeding zone in our simulations does not correlate with its final mass or semi-major axis, suggesting there is no systematic trend between a planet's mass and its volatile inventory. Instead, we find that the feeding zone of any planet more massive than 0. 1 M_Earth is roughly proportional to the radial extent of the initial disk from which it formed: Delta a~ 0. 25 (a_max-a_min), where a_min and a_max are the inner and outer edge of the initial planetesimal disk. These wide stochastic feeding zones have significant consequences for the origin of the Moon, since the canonical scenario predicts the Moon should be primarily composed of material from Earth's last major impactor (Theia), yet its isotopic composition is indistinguishable from Earth. In particular, we find that the feeding zones of Theia analogs are significantly more stochastic than the planetary analogs. Depending on our assumed initial distribution of oxygen isotopes within the planetesimal disk, we find a ~ 5 % or less probability that the Earth and Theia will form with an isotopic difference equal to or smaller than the Earth and Moon's. In fact we predict that every planetary mass body should be expected to have a unique isotopic signature. In addition, we find <b>paucities</b> <b>of</b> massive Theia analogs and high velocity moon-forming collisions, two recently proposed explanations for the Moon's isotopic composition. Our work suggests that there is still no scenario for the Moon's origin that explains its isotopic composition with a high probability event.
