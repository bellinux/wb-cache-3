5|$|Bowman {{argued that}} the {{authorized}} sale of the seeds extinguished the patent, and that Bowman merely used seeds legitimately purchased from the silo. He claimed that the Federal Circuit had created {{an exception to the}} exhaustion doctrine, and that this decision was properly for Congress to decide. Monsanto {{argued that the}} second-generation seeds were not subject to exhaustion because they had not existed until Bowman created them and had not been sold at the time of infringement. He noted that even when exhaustion applied, it did not allow one to create new copies of the <b>patented</b> <b>product,</b> which the second-generation seeds were.|$|E

25|$|LGE did not {{challenge}} {{the claim that}} the intended and reasonable use of the microprocessor products was to incorporate them into computers, but it claimed that some noninfringing uses existed: they could be sold overseas, as repair parts, or by disabling the features that made them patented. The Court dismissed these arguments. As for disablement, the Court asserted that the disabled device aspects (“features”) rather than the device that remained must have a noninfringing use, so that disabling them would cause them to have “no real use.” As for foreign or replacement use, the legal test to be looked to was whether the product would perform the patented method or embody the <b>patented</b> <b>product,</b> not whether the use gave rise to infringement liability.|$|E

500|$|In a {{unanimous}} opinion written by Justice Elena Kagan, the Supreme Court ruled that Bowman's conduct infringed Monsanto's patents {{and that the}} doctrine of patent exhaustion does not permit a farmer to reproduce patented seeds by planting and harvesting saved crop seeds without the patent holder's permission.

500|$|On May 13, 2013, Justice Elena Kagan {{delivered}} the Court's unanimous opinion, which affirmed {{the judgment of}} the Federal Circuit. Justice Kagan stated that while an authorized sale of a patented item terminates all patent rights to that item, that exhaustion does not permit a farmer to reproduce patented seeds through planting and harvesting without the patent holder's permission. Justice Kagan stated that when a farmer plants a harvested and saved seed, thereby growing a further soybean crop, that action constitutes an unauthorized [...] "making" [...] of the <b>patented</b> <b>product,</b> in violation of section 271(a) of the patent code. Justice Kagan concluded that Bowman could resell the patented seeds he obtained from the elevator, or use them as feed, but that he could not produce additional seeds (that is, crops).|$|E
2500|$|The {{first of}} these {{possible}} formats follows {{the pattern of the}} General Talking Pictures case. The second format follows the pattern of the Mallinckrodt case. Under the General Talking Pictures doctrine, a patentee may limit the scope of a manufacturer-licensee's license to a defined field—such as microprocessors not incorporated into computers—and then the use of those micropressors as computer components is a patent infringement. This is the format that LGE mistakenly thought it was using. Under the Mallinckrodt doctrine, a sale of a <b>patented</b> <b>product</b> subject to a restriction—such as you must not sell this microprocessor for use as a computer component—is a [...] "conditional," [...] rather than [...] "unconditional," [...] sale. If the condition is violated the conduct is patent infringement. The exhaustion doctrine does not apply under the rule stated in Mallinkrodt. However, as Quanta seemingly holds, when a restriction is not clearly and explicitly stated the exhaustion doctrine applies.|$|E

40|$|A SWOT {{analysis}} of the Indian Pharmaceutical Industry (IPI) in the WTO regime reveals that the much acclaimed IPI’s expertise in process development skills were {{made possible by the}} amendments made to the Indian Patents Act 1970. This strength should be utilized maximum to benefit from opportunities that arise from vertical disintegration of research, clinical trails and manufacturing by the multinationals. The weakness however {{lies in the fact that}} such opportunities will be limited to a few firms in this sector. IPI faces threats in the form of competition from other Asian giants particularly China which has similar expertise in process development and reverse engineering. This paper argues that the IPI should adopt various strategies like producing off <b>patented</b> <b>products,</b> new <b>patented</b> <b>products</b> by acquiring compulsory licensing or cross licensing, collaborate with multinationals not only in R&D and manufacturing but also in marketing new <b>patented</b> <b>products</b> and improving the standards of production to widen the export market.
