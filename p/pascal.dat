5|$|Tangled Ever After is set {{six months}} after the events of the {{original}} movie. In the short, <b>Pascal</b> and Maximus are ring bearers at Rapunzel and Flynn Rider's wedding. When Maximus suffers a reaction from one of the flower petals <b>Pascal</b> is sprinkling along the aisle, Maximus sneezes and the rings are propelled off the pillow on which he is carrying the rings; the fly through a window in the chapel and into the city streets. <b>Pascal</b> and Maximus discreetly sneak out of the chapel to retrieve them in time for Rapunzel and Flynn to exchange them. <b>Pascal</b> and Maximus encounter several obstacles and hindrances in their attempt, eventually crashing into a tar factor upon retrieving the rings from a flock of flying doves. Completely soiled, <b>Pascal</b> and Maximus finally return to the chapel and return the rings, only to cause the wedding cake to roll out the door.|$|E
5|$|Both {{individually}} {{and as a}} comedic duo, <b>Pascal</b> and Maximus have garnered universal acclaim from film critics, who referred to the characters as scene stealers – British magazine SFX dubbed Maximus the film's breakout star while The Age hailed the character as the funniest horse in film history – in addition to praising {{the fact that both}} characters are refreshingly funny, expressive and charismatic without the use of dialogue. Additionally, several film critics preferred <b>Pascal</b> and Maximus to the film's couple.|$|E
5|$|For {{the sake}} of convenience, some derived units have special names and symbols. Such units may {{themselves}} be used {{in combination with the}} names and symbols for base units and for other derived units to express the units of other derived quantities. For example, the SI unit of force is the newton (N), the SI unit of pressure is the <b>pascal</b> (Pa)—and the <b>pascal</b> can be defined as one newton per square metre (N/m2).|$|E

She makes a cameo in Tales of Hearts R dressed as the Sony mascot Toro Inoue.|$|E
5|$|Blaise <b>Pascal</b> {{invented the}} {{mechanical}} calculator in 1642; {{it was the}} first operational adding machine. It made use of a gravity-assisted carry mechanism. It was the only operational mechanical calculator in the 17thcentury and the earliest automatic, digital computer. Pascal's calculator was limited by its carry mechanism, which forced its wheels to only turn one way so it could add. To subtract, the operator had to use the Pascal's calculator's complement, which required as many steps as an addition. Giovanni Poleni followed <b>Pascal,</b> building the second functional mechanical calculator in 1709, a calculating clock made of wood that, once setup, could multiply two numbers automatically.|$|E
5|$|Five years later, Le huitième jour (1996) {{played at}} Cannes, where his two leading actors, Daniel Auteuil and <b>Pascal</b> Duquenne, were jointly awarded {{the prize for}} Best Actor.

5|$|Since the {{appointment}} of the first Chamois Niortais manager, the Swiss coach Franchina, there have been 31 different first-team managers. Three of the coaches, Kazimir Hnatow, Robert Charrier and <b>Pascal</b> Gastien, have {{had more than one}} spell in charge of the club. The current manager is <b>Pascal</b> Gastien, who was given the job in 2009 after Denis Troch was sacked following the side's relegation from the Championnat National. Gastien, a former Chamois Niortais player, is currently in his third spell as manager. To date, the only manager to have coached the club in the top division of French football is Patrick Parizon, during the 1987–88 season. The club's longest-serving manager was Ferdinand Faczinek, who had a five-year tenure between 1943 and 1948.|$|E

5|$|When Maximus {{eventually}} {{catches up}} with Rapunzel, Flynn and <b>Pascal,</b> the horse attempts to apprehend Flynn only to be charmed by Rapunzel, who convinces him to leave Flynn alone until they have arrived at their destination while <b>Pascal</b> ensures that the two maintain a healthy relationship. In the kingdom, Flynn, Rapunzel and <b>Pascal</b> embark on a canoe ride to see the floating lights, revealed to be lanterns, up-close, while Maximus is forced to wait ashore as {{there is not enough}} room for him. In a friendly gesture, Flynn gives him a bag of apples. Realizing that he is falling in love with Rapunzel, Flynn attempts to hand off the crown he was promised to the Stabbington Brothers, two colleagues of his, only to be kidnapped and handed over to the police. Mistaking this for abandonment, Rapunzel is taken back to the tower by Gothel, who has caught up with them.|$|E

50|$|Philosopher Nick Bostrom {{argues that}} <b>Pascal's</b> mugging, like <b>Pascal's</b> wager, {{suggests}} that giving a superintelligent artificial intelligence a flawed decision theory could be disastrous. <b>Pascal's</b> mugging {{may also be}} relevant when considering low-probability, high-stakes events such as existential risk or charitable interventions with a low probability of success but extremely high rewards.

5000|$|Just {{like one}} can {{interpret}} the binomial distribution as (normalized) one-dimensional (1D) slices of <b>Pascal's</b> triangle, so too can one interpret the multinomial distribution as 2D (triangular) slices of <b>Pascal's</b> pyramid, or 3D/4D/+ (pyramid-shaped) slices of higher-dimensional analogs of <b>Pascal's</b> triangle. This reveals {{an interpretation of}} the range of the distribution: discretized equilaterial [...] "pyramids" [...] in arbitrary dimension—i.e. a simplex with a grid.|$|R
5|$|Arsenal {{began the}} new {{campaign}} as league and cup double winners, and manager Arsène Wenger sought {{improvement in the}} Champions League, a competition the club failed in. The retirement of defender Tony Adams meant French midfielder Patrick Vieira was appointed as captain; <b>Pascal</b> Cygan was signed as a replacement in defence. Other recruitments included defensive midfielders Gilberto Silva and Kolo Touré, while goalkeepers Alex Manninger and Richard Wright departed to join Espanyol and Everton respectively.|$|E
5|$|COBOL's data {{structures}} influenced subsequent programming languages. Its {{record and}} file structure influenced PL/I and <b>Pascal,</b> and the REDEFINES clause was a predecessor to Pascal's variant records.

5|$|Columbia Pictures {{executive}} Amy <b>Pascal</b> suggested Angelina Jolie to Noyce, who {{had often}} spoken to Jolie {{in the past}} about a desire to create a female spy franchise. <b>Pascal</b> even invited Jolie for a Bond girl role, but the actress playfully replied that she {{was more interested in}} playing James Bond himself instead. Jolie was sent Salts script in September 2008 and liked it. Wimmer, Noyce, and producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura went to visit Jolie at her home in France to discuss a possible script and character change. Writer Brian Helgeland helped with the character development and dialogue of the script based on the notes that came out of those discussions with Jolie and to accompany the gender change, the title character's name was changed to Evelyn Salt.|$|E
