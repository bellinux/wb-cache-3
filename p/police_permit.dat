5|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, the ACLU {{continued}} its battle against censorship {{of art and}} literature. In 1948, the New York affiliate of the ACLU received mixed results from the Supreme Court, winning the appeal of Carl Jacob Kunz, who was convicted for speaking without a <b>police</b> <b>permit,</b> but losing the appeal of Irving Feiner who was arrested to prevent a breach of the peace, based on his oration denouncing president Truman and the American Legion. The ACLU lost the case of Joseph Beahharnais, who was arrested for group libel when he distributed literature impugning the character of African Americans.|$|E
5|$|Barkley gets a <b>police</b> <b>permit</b> to raid the Buyers Club, but can {{do nothing}} but give Woodroof a fine. In 1987, the FDA changes its {{regulations}} such that any unapproved drug is also illegal. As the Club runs out of funds, Rayon, who is addicted to cocaine, begs her father for money and tells Woodroof that she has sold her life insurance policy to raise money. Woodroof travels to Mexico and gets more of the peptide T. Upon return, Ron finds out that Rayon died after being taken to the hospital. Dr. Saks is also upset by her death, and is asked to resign when the hospital discovers she is linking patients with the Buyers Club, having learned that AZT trials previously conducted in France had proven the drug to be ineffective against HIV. She refuses to comply and insists {{that she would have}} to be fired.|$|E
25|$|On 8 July, Perkasa {{announced}} {{the cancellation of}} its counter-rally due to its inability to secure a venue and a <b>police</b> <b>permit.</b>|$|E

25|$|Police also {{tightened}} laws on {{the sale}} of police and military uniforms. Those who wanted to trade and produce police and military uniform and insignia would need a <b>police</b> <b>permit,</b> a condition introduced following the Al-Maunah incident.|$|E
25|$|On 1 May 2002, Chee {{staged a}} rally {{in front of the}} Istana (the {{official}} residence and office of the President of Singapore), even though his application to the police for a licence to hold the assembly had been denied. Chee was later charged for trespassing and for attempting to hold a rally without a <b>police</b> <b>permit,</b> for which he was sentenced to five weeks in jail.|$|E
25|$|For {{election}} meetings such as rallies to be held, permits must {{be applied}} for from the Commissioner of Police at the Police Elections Liaison Office in the Police Cantonment Complex. The dates and venues for the meetings are fixed by the police, and candidates may apply for permits on a first-come-first-served basis {{the day before}} each meeting date. Although meetings can normally be held at Speakers' Corner without applying for a <b>police</b> <b>permit,</b> this privilege does not apply during election periods.|$|E

50|$|In 1903 Parliament {{formed and}} passed the Boxing and Wrestling Act to cover the facets and the issuing of a <b>Police</b> boxing <b>permit.</b> The act and {{regulations}} have been slightly amended over the years. The latest amendment was 1984, because only boxing and wrestling is named in the current act and regulations, is why all the other combat sports {{do not have to}} apply for <b>Police</b> <b>permits</b> or restricted by anything else such that is required for current day boxers.|$|R

25|$|On 22 August 2006, Chee {{announced}} that he was planning to hold protests in Singapore during 61st Annual Meetings of the Boards of Governors of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group in September 2006 (as part of Singapore 2006), to protest against the rising income gap and raise awareness of the hardships of working-class people in Singapore. The application for a <b>police</b> <b>permit</b> for the protest was rejected on 30 August 2006. Even without a permit, Chee still used the SDP website to continue to urge people to participate in the protest.|$|E
25|$|Street demonstrations {{are rare}} in Malaysia, {{but the public}} has become more vocal {{with the rise of}} {{alternative}} media and a resurgent opposition. Gatherings in Malaysia of five or more people must receive a <b>police</b> <b>permit,</b> which is rarely granted. The government has used heavy police presence to block rallies as well as arrest protest leaders to stop illegal public protests. Former prime minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said he was willing to sacrifice public freedoms in the interest of national stability. Four rallies in 2007 ended with arrests made by police. A protest in 2009 against the Internal Security Act was also broken up by tear gas and water cannons.|$|E

25|$|The police {{vowed to}} stop any rallies from {{taking place on}} the planned date {{on the grounds that}} all public gatherings without <b>police</b> <b>permits</b> are illegal. Having {{originally}} planned to march through the streets of Kuala Lumpur, Bersih decided to hold its rally at Merdeka Stadium after consultations with the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Malaysia's head of state.|$|R
50|$|The PAA {{will replace}} Section 27 of the Police Act 1967, which means <b>police</b> <b>permits</b> for mass {{assemblies}} {{will no longer}} be required. Instead, organisers must notify the officer in charge of the police district (OCPD) within 10 days before the gathering date. The OCPD will respond to the notification within five days, outlining the restrictions and conditions imposed.|$|R
25|$|Concurrently {{with the}} {{developments}} surrounding Barry's murder, a 13-year-old girl, {{known in the}} press as Binta, was allegedly raped by a uniformed paramilitary police officer (part of the Police Intervention Unit) at the Independence Stadium during an inter-schools sports competition. A medical examination confirmed that the girl had been raped, and GAMSU again pressed the government for answers, calling for the girl {{to be allowed to}} identify the rapist. Following a long delay in any government action, GAMSU requested a <b>police</b> <b>permit</b> to hold a public protest. The request was denied, but, referring to their constitutional right to protest, GAMSU called its members {{to take part in a}} peaceful march towards the capital city of Banjul.|$|E
25|$|In {{the days}} leading up to the rally, the {{government}} warned Malaysians not to take part in the rally as an official permit had not been granted. Citizens were warned that anyone who turned up and participate in the rally would be immediately arrested, because the rally is deemed as illegal since the current Malaysian law bans public gatherings of more than five persons without a permit. However, it should be noted that in July last year, a <b>police</b> <b>permit</b> has released for Umno Youth to hold a protest to demand that the US and Israel end the violence in the Middle East, while US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was in Kuala Lumpur for a meeting with Asean leaders.|$|E
25|$|In 1907, David {{was arrested}} for helping to plan a bakers' strike and was held for three days. In January 1908, David was arrested again, this time for {{attending}} a union election meeting held without a <b>police</b> <b>permit.</b> Not quite 16, the boy was held for 18 months in jails in Łódź, Warsaw, and Moscow, before being sentenced to exile in Chelyabinsk, Siberia. While en route to his place of exile, {{he walked out of}} the camp where the authorities were holding him and, after several months hiding in Chelyabinsk and Białystok, managed to make his way to the United States in 1911 with a ticket sent to him by one of his brothers, who was living in New York City.|$|E
50|$|Police {{arrived at}} the Routier home within three minutes of the 911 call. They {{discovered}} a window screen in the garage had been cut, which indicated a possible entry point for an intruder. A search {{of the house and}} grounds did not locate an intruder. Having thus secured the site, <b>police</b> <b>permitted</b> paramedics to attend to the victims.|$|R

5|$|Goebbels, however, wanted more, {{and he saw}} in Wessel's {{shooting}} {{the possibility of a}} propaganda bonanza. The beginning of his plan was to turn Wessel's funeral into a mass demonstration full of speeches and processions of SA men in uniform, but he could not get the necessary <b>police</b> <b>permits</b> to do so, even after Wessel's sister requested Hindenburg to relent.|$|R
25|$|A {{figure in}} Singapore's {{political}} opposition, Chee {{has been arrested}} and jailed several times for his political activities, mainly for making speeches and staging public demonstrations without a <b>police</b> <b>permit.</b> He has also been found guilty of defamation on multiple occasions for comments he has made about members of Singapore's governing People's Action Party (PAP). He was previously barred from standing in parliamentary elections because he was declared bankrupt in 2006 after failing to pay damages from a lawsuit owed to two former Singaporean prime ministers, Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong. However, on 24 September 2012, Chee {{announced that he had}} raised the sum of S$30,000 needed to pay Lee and Goh. His bankruptcy has since been discharged, which has allowed him to contest the 2015 Singaporean general election.|$|E
25|$|On 13 May 1969, a {{few days}} after the 10 May general election, a race riot broke out. In the {{preceding}} election, parties like the Democratic Action Party (DAP, formerly the Malaysian branch of the PAP) and Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia, which opposed special Bumiputra privileges, had made substantial gains, coming close to defeating the Alliance and forming a new government. The largely Chinese opposition Democratic Action Party and Gerakan later secured a <b>police</b> <b>permit</b> for a victory parade through a fixed route in Kuala Lumpur, the capital city of Malaysia. However, the rowdy procession deviated from its route and headed through the Malay district of Kampung Baru, jeering at the inhabitants. While the Gerakan party issued an apology the next day, UMNO announced a counter-procession starting from the head of Selangor state Dato' Harun bin Idris on Jalan Raja Muda. Reportedly, the gathering crowd was informed that Malays on their way to the procession had been attacked by Chinese in Setapak, several miles to the north. The angry protestors swiftly wreaked revenge by killing two passing Chinese motorcyclists, and the riot began. The official death toll was approximately 200, although some would later estimate it to be as high as 2000. The riot was later attributed to the underlying discontent among Malays due to poverty.|$|E
500|$|The Public Order Act, {{intended}} to regulate public assemblies and processions and to introduce new powers {{for the preservation}} of public order, came into force on 9 October 2009. On the same day, the Public Order (Unrestricted Area) Order 2009 ("2009 POA Order") made pursuant to the Act declared that Speakers' Corner was an unrestricted area in which assemblies and processions could be held without the need for a <b>police</b> <b>permit.</b> Thus, at present, Speakers' Corner is concurrently regulated by the Parks and Trees Regulations, and by exemption orders issued under the PEMA and POA. The conditions under which addresses, debates, demonstrations, discussions, lectures and talks (whether or not together with any exhibition, performance, play-reading or recital), must be held have remained essentially unchanged. Speakers and demonstration organizers must be Singapore citizens, while participants in demonstrations must be either citizens or permanent residents. Banners, films, flags, photographs, placards, posters, signs, writing or other visible representations or paraphernalia containing violent, lewd or obscene material must not be displayed or exhibited. Persons making speeches must use any of the four official languages of Singapore or related dialects, and organizers of demonstrations must be present throughout the event. In January 2008, the Complaints Choir, a vocal group participating in the M1 Singapore Fringe Festival 2008, was denied the chance to perform at Speakers' Corner and other outdoor venues unless the six foreigners in the group of 50 did not participate in the performance. As the choir did not wish to be split up in any way, it decided not {{to go ahead with the}} performance. Queried on the matter in Parliament, the Minister for Communication, Information and the Arts Dr. Lee Boon Yang stated that the Government did not think it [...] "desirable or good precedent" [...] for [...] "foreigners [...] here to organise and to lead Singaporeans to complain about our domestic issues".|$|E
50|$|Between 2000 - 2001 Andy Hayman (former Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan <b>Police)</b> <b>permitted</b> Dizaei's {{telephone}} calls to be intercepted and transcribed {{as part of}} Operation Helios. In 2006, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal ruled that 3,500 calls were 'unlawfully' intercepted. The Commissioner Ian Blair apologised. On 20 May 2011 Dizaei was informed that he may possibly {{have been subject to}} phone hacking by News of the World.|$|R
