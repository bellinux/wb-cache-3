50|$|The {{toxicity}} of organomercury compounds presents both dangers and benefits. Dimethylmercury in particular, is notoriously toxic, but has found {{use as an}} antifungal agent and insecticide. Merbromin and <b>phenylmercuric</b> <b>borate</b> are used as topical antiseptics, while Nitromersol {{is used as a}} preservative for vaccines and antitoxins.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenylmercuric</b> <b>borate</b> and acetate {{were used}} for {{disinfecting}} mucous membranes at an effective concentration of 0.07% in aqueous solutions. Due to toxicological and ecotoxicological reasons phenylmercury salts {{are no longer in}} use. However, some surgeons use mercurochrome despite toxicological objections. Dental amalgam used in fillings inhibits bacterial reproduction.|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of seven metallic compounds was tested against penicillinase (beta lactamase) producing strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG) and non-PPNG strains. On a weight basis, the mercurials showed the greatest in vitro activity. <b>Phenylmercuric</b> <b>borate,</b> thiomersal, and mercuric chloride inhibited 90 % of all strains at concentrations of 5 mg/l, 5 mg/l, and 20 mg/l respectively. Silver nitrate inhibited 90 % of the strains at 80 mg/l and the MIC 90 for mild silver protein was 200 mg/l. Copper and selenium salts had lower in vitro activities, inhibiting 90 % {{of all the}} strains at 320 mg/l and 640 mg/l respectively. Silver nitrate and the six other compounds tested showed equal activities against PPNG and non-PPNG strains. This finding supports the recommendation for prophylaxis of gonococcal conjunctivitis of the newborn with 1 % silver nitrate eye drops...|$|E
40|$|FUNGI MAY BECOME ETIOLOGIC AGENTS UNDER A VARIETY OF CONDITIONS THAT PRODUCE AN ALTERED HOST RESPONSE. HOST RESPONSE IS COMPROMISED WITH LEUCEMIA, LEMPHOMATOUS DISEASES, APLASTIC ANAEMIA AND CANCER WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT DEBILITATINGDISEASE. UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE MYCOSES ARE NOT ONLY DUE TO PATHOGENIC FUNGI BUT THEY ARE ALSO CAUSED BY SAPROPHYTIC FUNGI EXISTING IN THE ENVIRONMENT, THE SKIN, OR IN THE MUCOSA OF PATIENTS AND PEOPLE WORKING IN A HOSPITAL. THESE FUNGI ARE USUALLY UBIQUITOUS IN NATURE, AND THEY ARE CALLED "OPPORTUNISTIC". THIS RESEARCH INVESTIGATED THE FREQUENCY OF YEASTS IN THE MOUTH MUCOSA OF CERTAIN PATIENT CATEGORIES: COMPROMISED HOSTS DUE TO DIMINISHED CELLULARIMMUNITY (GROUP A), HOST WITH REDUCED NORMAL FLORA DUE TO ADMINISTRATION OF BROAD SPECTRUM ANTIBIOTICS (GROUP B), DUE TO ADMINISTRATION OF CORTICOSTEROIDS (GROUP C), AND DUE TO ADMINISTRATION OF CYTOSTATICS OR IMMUNOSUPRESSIVES (GROUP D). THE GROUP (E), CONSISTED OF SAMPLES TAKEN FROM PEOPLE IN THE HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT, THAT IS NURSES AND DOCTORS, OTHER HOSPITAL PERSONEL AND VISITORS. THE SAME SUBJECTS WERE USED TO ASSURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DIFFERENT ANTISEPTICS USED FOR ORAL DISINFECTION. THESE WERE AS FOLLOWS: POVIDONE IODINE, DOMIPHEN BROMIDE, <b>PHENYLMERCURIC</b> <b>BORATE</b> AND HEXETIDINE. THE SUBJECTS WERE CHECKED BEFORE THE (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED) ...|$|E
40|$|An {{automated}} (AutoAnalyzer) {{method for}} the colorimetric determination of creatine kinase activity in serum is described. This method includes reactivation of creatine kinase with cysteine, incubation {{of the active}} enzyme with creatine phosphate and adenosine diphosphate at 3750, and subsequent inactivation of enzyme and binding of csteine by <b>phenylmercuric</b> <b>borate.</b> The enzymatically produced creatine is dialyzed against a solution of diacetyl and reacted with a-naphthol in an alkaline solution. The absorbance of the colored end product is measured at 550 mc. Individual blanks are determined {{in the absence of}} adenosine diphosphate. Comparison of results obtained by this method and a manual procedure shows satisfactory agreement. SINCE CIIEATINE IUNA 5 E (CK) * was first observed in serum of patients with progressive muscular dystrophy (2), many additional investiga-tions have pointed up the usefulness of tilis enzymatic test in the diag-nosis of clinical conditions involving skeletal muscle, as well as the myocardium. The almost complete absence of this enzyme from liver and red blood cells lends significance to any abnormal serum activity with regard to increased permeability or trauma of muscle tissue. It is well known that (â€˜K exhibits only part of its potential activity unless it is reactivated by short incubation with cysteine or other sulf-hydryl-containing compounds (3). Various methods have been described for the determination of CK activity in serum, but owing to the equi-librium conditions of the reaction catalyzed by CK (4), CP- + ADP- + 11 + C + ATP 4 -, those methods which employ as substrates ereatine phosphate (CP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) are generally preferable to others which utilize the reverse reaction with creatine (C) and adenosine tn...|$|E
