40|$|AbstractThe <b>tempered</b> <b>glass</b> {{is widely}} used in the {{buildings}} because of its good transparence and fire endurance {{under the protection of}} the sprinkler. The fire backdraft may occur under the good ventilation condition after the <b>tempered</b> <b>glasses</b> fall apart in fire, which can endanger the human evacuation and fire rescue. By the testing of the surface temperature of the <b>tempered</b> <b>glass</b> exposed to the building fire, the critical temperature of the glass fracture can be acquired and the basis for the prediction and prevention of the fracture of the <b>tempered</b> <b>glass</b> then can be provided, which is useful for the performance-based design of the fire safety. The infrared imaging equipment is firstly used in China for the research on the fire endurance of the <b>tempered</b> <b>glass...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{tempering}} process {{does not change}} the stiffness of the glass. Annealed glass undergoes a similar deflection compared to <b>tempered</b> <b>glass</b> under the same load, but <b>tempered</b> <b>glass</b> can take a higher load and, therefore, deflects further before breaking.|$|R
50|$|Francois Barthelemy Alfred Royer de la Bastie (1830-1901) of Paris, France is {{credited}} with first developing a method of <b>tempering</b> <b>glass</b> by quenching almost molten glass in a heated bath of oil or grease in 1874, the method patented in England on August 12, 1874, patent number 2783. <b>Tempered</b> <b>glass</b> is sometimes known as Bastie glass after de la Bastie. In 1877 the German Frederick Siemens developed a different process, sometimes called compressed glass or Siemens <b>glass,</b> producing a <b>tempered</b> <b>glass</b> stronger than the Bastie process by pressing the glass in cool molds. The first patent on a whole process to make <b>tempered</b> <b>glass</b> was held by chemist Rudolph A. Seiden {{who was born in}} 1900 in Austria and immigrated to the United States in 1935.|$|R

5000|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{heat-treated}} glass: heat-strengthened and fully <b>tempered.</b> Heat-strengthened <b>glass</b> is twice as strong as annealed glass; while fully <b>tempered</b> <b>glass</b> typically has four to six times the strength of annealed glass, and withstands heating in microwave ovens. The difference is the residual stress in the edge and <b>glass</b> surface.

40|$|Glass is a {{material}} that is strong in compression but has widely varying strength in tension and fractures uncontrollably. The results that are {{reported in the literature}} vary widely. Reliable data about the strength of annealed and <b>tempered</b> float <b>glass</b> are scarce. 4 point bending tests have been conducted on annealed and fully <b>tempered</b> float <b>glass</b> panels of two different sizes. The tests were done with the panels in a standing position rather than the more common lying position. The results show that the design strength of <b>tempered</b> <b>glass</b> is much less than commonly assumed. Failure in both types of glass starts at defects in the tensile zone. The amount of crack branching correlates well with the strength of the <b>glass.</b> In <b>tempered</b> <b>glass</b> cracks first grow from the defect that initiates failure. The decohesion of the <b>tempered</b> <b>glass</b> into little fragments follows after the panel has already failed...|$|R

40|$|The {{strength}} of glass {{as used in}} architectural engineering {{is one of those}} things about which too little is known. To determine what would be a safe design stress for glass in a completely glass structure, tests have been done on panels of annealed float <b>glass</b> and fully <b>tempered</b> <b>glass</b> using different sizes and both lying and standing positions. The results demonstrate that the {{strength of}} both annealed and <b>tempered</b> <b>glass</b> is dependent on the orientation of loading, the commonly held strength values for <b>tempered</b> <b>glass</b> are a gross over estimate for beams under bending loading, the strength data cannot be described by Weibull statistics...|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to glassing violence, {{the government of}} Western Australia in 2011 made recommendations to the state hospitality industry {{on the use of}} <b>tempered</b> <b>glass</b> in hotels. The state government and the Australian Hotels Association created a self-regulatory program on the rollout of <b>tempered</b> <b>glass</b> in pubs, with most hotels and bars expected to change over to <b>tempered</b> beer <b>glasses</b> in six to 12 months.

40|$|The {{correlation}} between K + -Na+ diffusion coefficient and mechanical properties of chemically tempered and hybrid tempered (chemically tempered subsequent to thermally <b>tempered)</b> aluminosilicate <b>glass</b> are investigated. Firstly, the potassium ion concentration profiles are experimentally measured and the diffusion coefficient is calculated {{according to the}} Boltzmann-Matano approach. Secondly, the flexure strength and Weibull modulus are determined using a combined experimental (coaxial double ring) and finite element analysis method. The {{results indicate that the}} flexural strength decreases with the diffusion coefficient of the air side for both types of glass samples while there is no significant relationship between diffusion coefficient and Weibull modulus. Diffusion coefficient on air side shows a higher value than that of the tin side. With the same diffusion coefficient, the flexural strength of chemically <b>tempered</b> <b>glasses</b> are found to be higher than that for hybrid <b>tempered</b> <b>glasses.</b> The effect of diffusion coefficient on modulus of rupture (MOR) for hybrid <b>tempered</b> <b>glass</b> is more remarkable.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{residual}} stress measurement in industrially manufactured <b>tempered</b> <b>glass</b> components has been {{addressed by the}} development and application of an experimental stress analysis technique known as pulsed magneto-photoelasticity. In the manufacture of <b>tempered</b> <b>glass,</b> residual stress is intentionally introduced in order to strengthen the material. However, {{the exact nature of}} the stress distribution remains unknown and, as a consequence, the strength of <b>tempered</b> <b>glass</b> products can vary significantly. A pulsed magneto-polariscope has been developed to allow the residual stress in glass to be quantified both through the thickness of the material and over the surface plane. Developments to the theory of the technique have enabled optical data, collected in the presence of multiple magnetic fields, to be used to provide a more detailed analysis of the residual stress distribution than has previously been possible. In the first phase of development, a pulsed magneto-polariscope with a continuous bore solenoid coil was designed and constructed. This enabled the proposed developments to be validated by testing birefringent specimens of epoxy resin and sectioned <b>tempered</b> <b>glass</b> test specimens. In addition, computer programs were developed to reduce the experimental complexity of the technique and to provide a platform upon which further research can be undertaken. The technique was extended by the design and inclusion of a novel component termed the dual coil solenoid which enabled high instantaneous magnetic flux densities to be generated, homogenously, over a wo. rking volume thereby allowing industrially manufactured <b>tempered</b> <b>glass</b> products to be analysed. Furthermore, this enabled test specimens of glass to be placed under known loads in order to precisely validate the proposed methodology. The pulsed magneto-polariscope was used to successfully quantify the residual stress distribution within a selection of automotive <b>tempered</b> <b>glass</b> products. The results demonstrated the ability of the developed technique to measure the residual stress in these components and to detect defects incurred in the manufacturing process.
