25|$|During World War II, Gleason was {{initially}} exempt from military service, {{since he was}} a father of two. However, in 1943 the US started drafting men with children. Gleason reported to his induction where the doctors discovered that his broken left arm had healed crooked, the area between his thumb and forefinger was nerveless and numb, a <b>pilonidal</b> cyst existed {{at the end of his}} coccyx, and that he was 100 pounds overweight. Gleason was therefore classified 4-F, and rejected for military service.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pilonidal</b> cyst, also {{referred}} to as a <b>pilonidal</b> abscess, <b>pilonidal</b> sinus or sacrococcygeal fistula, is a cyst or abscess near or on the natal cleft of the buttocks that often contains hair and skin debris.|$|E
50|$|One {{proposed}} {{cause of}} <b>pilonidal</b> cysts is ingrown hair. Excessive sitting {{is thought to}} predispose people to the condition, as sitting increases pressure on the coccygeal region. Trauma is not believed to cause a <b>pilonidal</b> cyst; however, such an event may result in inflammation of an existing cyst. However, there are cases where this can occur months after a localized injury to the area. Some researchers have proposed that <b>pilonidal</b> cysts {{may be the result}} of a congenital <b>pilonidal</b> dimple. Excessive sweating can also contribute to the cause of a <b>pilonidal</b> cyst. Moisture can fill a stretched hair follicle, which helps create a low-oxygen environment that promotes the growth of anaerobic bacteria, often found in <b>pilonidal</b> cysts. The presence of bacteria and low oxygen levels hamper wound healing and exacerbate a forming <b>pilonidal</b> cyst.|$|E
50|$|A small {{dermoid cyst}} on the coccyx can be {{difficult}} to distinguish from a <b>pilonidal</b> cyst. This is partly because both can be full of hair. A <b>pilonidal</b> cyst is a <b>pilonidal</b> sinus that is obstructed. Any teratoma near the body surface may develop a sinus or a fistula, or even a cluster of these. Such is the case of Canadian Football League linebacker Tyrone Jones, whose teratoma was discovered when he blew a tooth out of his nose.|$|E
50|$|Ingrown hair can obstruct hair follicles in the intergluteal cleft, {{exciting}} {{a foreign}} body reaction, leading to {{formation of a}} <b>pilonidal</b> cyst. Secondary tracks may open onto the skin, allowing the cyst to drain a foul smelling discharge, which {{is known as a}} <b>pilonidal</b> sinus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pilonidal</b> means nest of {{hair and}} {{is derived from the}} Latin words for hair (pilus) and nest (nidus). The {{condition}} was first described by Herbert Mayo in 1833. R.M. Hodges was the first to use the phrase <b>pilonidal</b> cyst to describe the condition in 1880.|$|E
50|$|A sinus tract, {{or small}} channel, may {{originate}} {{from the source}} of infection {{and open to the}} surface of the skin. Material from the cyst may drain through the <b>pilonidal</b> sinus. A <b>pilonidal</b> cyst is usually painful, but with draining, the patient might not feel pain.|$|E
5000|$|Dermoid sinus is {{a thought}} to be a genetic skin {{condition}} in dogs. It is also known as <b>pilonidal</b> sinus. However, unlike <b>pilonidal</b> sinus in humans, the dermoid sinus in dogs is a neural tube defect. [...] Dermoid sinus is sometimes also confused with dermoid cyst (a teratoma).|$|E

50|$|A <b>pilonidal</b> cyst can {{resemble}} a dermoid cyst, {{a kind of}} teratoma (germ cell tumor). In particular, a <b>pilonidal</b> cyst in the gluteal cleft can {{resemble a}} sacrococcygeal teratoma. Correct diagnosis is important because all teratomas require complete surgical excision, if possible without any spillage, and consultation with an oncologist.|$|E

50|$|Associated {{musculoskeletal}} {{findings are}} sometimes reported. When it occurs with acne conglobata, hidradenitis suppurativa, and <b>pilonidal</b> cysts, the syndrome {{is referred to}} as the follicular occlusion triad or tetrad.|$|E
50|$|Fistulae {{draining}} {{into the}} perianal region, {{as well as}} <b>pilonidal</b> diseases, are the main entities that fall within this category. Perianal tumours can also discharge when they fungate, or otherwise become cystic or necrotic.|$|E
50|$|An {{attractive}} {{minimally invasive}} technique {{is to treat}} <b>pilonidal</b> sinus with fibrin glue. This technique is less painful than traditional excisional techniques and flaps, can be performed under local or general anaesthesia, does not require dressings or packing and allows return to normal activities within 1 to 2 days. Long term outcome and recurrence rates are not dissimilar to more invasive techniques in 5 year follow {{up in a small}} randomised controlled trial.Fibrin glue has also been shown to be better than more invasive alternatives in the treatment of <b>pilonidal</b> sinus disease in children, where a quick return to normal activities and minimal postoperative pain are especially important.|$|E
50|$|Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a non-contagious chronic {{skin disease}} which affects intertriginous skin of apocrine sweat gland bearing areas like the inframammary fold and {{intermammary}} sulcus. It {{is characterized by}} clusters of abscesses, epidermoid cysts, sebaceous cysts, <b>pilonidal</b> cysts.|$|E
50|$|Treatment for {{dermoid cyst}} is {{complete}} surgical removal, preferably {{in one piece}} and without any spillage of cyst contents. Marsupialization, a surgical technique often used to treat <b>pilonidal</b> cyst, is inappropriate for dermoid cyst due {{to the risk of}} malignancy.|$|E
50|$|A sacral dimple (also termed <b>pilonidal</b> dimple or spinal dimple) {{is a small}} {{depression}} in the skin, located just above the buttocks. The name comes from the sacrum, the bone {{at the end of}} the spine, over which the dimples are found.|$|E
5000|$|In 1975, Plewig and Kligman, {{following}} Pillsbury's research path, {{modified the}} [...] "acne triad", {{replacing it with}} the [...] "acne tetrad: acne triad, plus <b>pilonidal</b> sinus". Plewig and Kligman's research follows in Pillsbury's footsteps, offering explanations of the symptoms associated with hidradenitis suppurativa.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pilonidal</b> cysts are itchy and {{are often}} very painful, and {{typically}} occur {{between the ages of}} 15 and 35. [...] Although usually found near the coccyx, the condition can also affect the navel, armpit or genital region, though these locations are much rarer.|$|E
50|$|The {{more common}} course for {{surgical}} treatment {{is for the}} cyst to be surgically excised (along with <b>pilonidal</b> sinus tracts). Post-surgical wound packing may be necessary, and packing typically must be replaced once daily for 4 to 8 weeks. In some cases, two years may be required for complete granulation to occur. Sometimes the cyst is resolved via surgical marsupialization.|$|E
5000|$|He {{moved to}} Oregon in 1960 {{and worked in}} Eugene, where he did much of his {{important}} research into <b>pilonidal</b> disease, a condition more popularly known as [...] "Jeep seat." [...] The condition had long been attributed to congenital pits in the skin, ingrown hairs or trauma from repeated pressure over the tailbone (such as riding long periods on bumpy terrain in a Jeep). Bascom researched and proposed an alternate theory that normal hair follicles grew infected and swelled shut, with the infection then tracking down into soft fat below the skin and creating abscesses. He also helped adapt and refine less-invasive surgeries for treating persistent <b>pilonidal</b> disease. This work was praised as [...] "lucid" [...] and a [...] "paradigm shift" [...] by some fellow surgeons. He also published articles on topics including hernias and saline overload, and belonged to professional groups including the Oregon Board of Medical Examiners, which he chaired.|$|E
5000|$|Surgeons {{can also}} excise the sinus and repair with a {{reconstructive}} flap technique, {{such as a}} [...] "cleft lift" [...] procedure or Z-plasty, usually done under general anesthetic. This approach is especially useful for complicated or recurring <b>pilonidal</b> disease, leaves little scar tissue and flattens the region between the buttocks, {{reducing the risk of}} recurrence. [...] This approach typically results in a more rapid recovery than the traditional surgery, however there are fewer surgeons trained in the cleft lift procedure and thus, it may not be as accessible to patients, depending on their geographic location. Meta analysis shows recurrence rates were lower in open healing than with primary closure (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.87) at the expense of time to healing. <b>Pilonidal</b> cysts recur and do so more frequently if the surgical wound is sutured in the midline, as opposed to away from the midline, which obliterates the natal cleft and removes the focus of shearing stress. An incision lateral to the intergluteal cleft is therefore preferred, especially given the poor healing of midline incisions in this region.|$|E
5000|$|The {{technique}} is often applied to pancreatic cysts, <b>pilonidal</b> cysts, and Bartholin's cysts. [...] In {{the case of}} a dentigerous cyst, marsupialization may be performed to allow the growing tooth associated with the cyst to continue eruption into the oral cavity. It is also in use in dacryocystorhinostomy surgery in which the lacrimal sac mucosa is connected to the nasal mucosa above the level of the mechanical obstruction at the nasolacrimal duct.|$|E
50|$|Skin {{involvement}} in subcutaneous tissue infections includes: cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, breast abscess, decubitus ulcers, infected <b>pilonidal</b> cyst or sinus, Meleney's ulcer infected diabetic (vascular or trophic) ulcers, bite wound, anaerobic cellulitis and gas gangrene, bacterial synergistic gangrene, and burn wound infection. Deeper anaerobic soft-tissue infections are necrotizing fasciitis, necrotizing synergistic cellulitis, gas gangrene and crepitus cellulitis. These can involve the fascia {{as well as}} the muscle surrounded by the fascia, and may also induce myositis and myonecrosis.|$|E
5000|$|A surgeon from Paris, Velpeau {{described}} an unusual inflammatory process with formation of superficial axillary, submammary, and perianal abscesses in 1839. One {{of his colleagues}} also located in Paris, named Verneuil, coined the term hidrosadénite phlegmoneuse about 15 years later. This name for the disease reflects the former pathogenetic model of acne inversa, which is considered inflammation of sweat glands as {{the primary cause of}} hidradenitis suppurativa. In 1922, Schiefferdecker suspected a pathogenic association between acne inversa and apocrine sweat glands. In 1956 Pillsbury postulated follicular occlusion as the cause of acne inversa, which they grouped together with acne conglobata and perifolliculitis capitis abscendens et suffodiens (dissecting cellulitis of the scalp) as the [...] "acne triad". Plewig and Kligman added another element to their acne triad, <b>pilonidal</b> sinus. Plewig et al. noted that this new [...] "acne tetrad" [...] includes all the elements found in the original [...] "acne triad", in addition to a fourth element, <b>pilonidal</b> sinus. In 1989, Plewig and Steger introduced the term [...] "acne inversa", indicating a follicular source of the disease and replacing older terms such as [...] "Verneuil disease".|$|E
5000|$|Kshara is {{an extract}} of {{the ashes of}} Achyranthes aspera used in Ayurveda; it is very alkaline. [...] It is given to people to drink in a highly diluted form as a remedy for worms, indigestion, kidney stones, skin diseases, and obesity. [...] It is also {{administered}} topically in a less diluted form, especially for problems of the anus and rectum like haemorrhoids, rectal prolapse, {{and to try to}} control infection after fistulectomy, after cutting away <b>pilonidal</b> sinus, and after draining abscesses in that region; it is also used on infected wounds more generally.|$|E

He begins training, and quickly realizes that he is massively out of shape and suffers debilitating shin splints. He joins a running club, begins training with legendary distance runner Bruce Tulloh and undergoes physical therapy to evaluate his progress, refusing to give up when his physical evaluation says he would fail to complete a half marathon in under 2:45 hours.|$|E
