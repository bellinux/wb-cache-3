5|$|He {{was dressed}} in a strange way. A šajkača was <b>pulled</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front of his head and almost {{completely}} covered his forehead. His eyebrows were hardly visible. Under its weight, the ears seemed to have collapsed. He wore a kind of long, black coat, covered in mud and held in place by a string. He used another piece of string for a belt, and from it hung a pot for boiling water, a tea strainer, a canteen, and other useful things. He walked slightly bent forward, followed everywhere by the noise of the things clashing at his waist.|$|E
5|$|Montoya {{made his}} pit stop on lap 22. However, his pit stop proved problematic: the signal lights at his pit box stopped working, causing the Williams refuller {{to switch to}} the fuel rig for Ralf Schumacher and Montoya {{remained}} stationary for 20 seconds longer than usual. Montoya was also fuelled for longer than his team planned. Ralf Schumacher thus inherited the lead with Michael Schumacher behind him and Montoya re-emerged in fourth place. One lap later, Michael Schumacher took his pit stop and he {{came out with a}} fuel pressure problem which meant he <b>pulled</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> side of the main straight and retired. Burti spun off and beached his car in the gravel trap at Nordkurve on the same lap. Ralf Schumacher made his pit stop on lap 24 and rejoined with a 10-second advantage. Villeneuve, Button and Alonso all followed Ralf Schumacher into the pit lane on the same lap. Alonso encountered a problem when leaving his pit box: the Minardi refuelling valve had a problem, and his car's afterburner remained on, though the flames extinguished themselves when Alonso accelerated out of the pit lane. Montoya pulled {{over to the side of}} the track on lap 25, with smoke billowing from his engine, and retired. Fisichella made a pit stop from fourth on lap 26 and re-emerged in fifth behind Villeneuve. Marques retired from the race with a gearbox problem on the same lap. Coulthard made a pit stop on lap 27 and immediately became the race's next retirement when he acclerated away from his pit box with a blown engine. The resulting event meant he <b>pulled</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> side of the circuit. Panis made his pit stop on lap 31 and came out behind Button and Alesi. Barrichello became the final driver to make a scheduled pit stop on the 32nd lap.|$|E
5|$|As the {{sun rose}} at 04:00 on 2 August, firing broke out once again between the French {{southern}} division of Guillaume Tell, Tonnant, Généreux and Timoléon and the battered Alexander and Majestic. Although briefly outmatched, the British ships were soon joined by Goliath and Theseus. As Captain Miller manoeuvred his ship into position, Theseus briefly came under fire from the frigate Artémise. Miller turned his ship towards Artémise, but Captain Pierre-Jean Standelet struck his flag and ordered his men to abandon the frigate. Miller sent a boat under Lieutenant William Hoste to take possession of the empty vessel, but Standelet had set fire to his ship as he left and Artémise blew up shortly afterwards. The surviving French ships of the line, covering their retreat with gunfire, gradually <b>pulled</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east away from the shore at 06:00.

5|$|On {{the same}} lap Irvine overtook his {{teammate}} Herbert for tenth position. Wurz {{crashed into the}} barriers at turn 1 {{and was forced to}} retire. Gené retired on lap 22 with a gearbox issue as his teammate Mazzacane subsequently collided with the barriers at turn one on the same lap and had to retire from the event. Herbert became the first driver to make a pit stop on lap 27 although his pit crew came unprepared and Herbert was stationary for half a minute before he exited in 17th position. On the 31st lap, Diniz made contact with the barriers at turn one and he damaged his left rear wheel, causing him to retire. Häkkinen's pace was reduced by lap 36 as he slowed with an blockage on his brake pedal and made an unscheduled pit stop. His team's mechanics opened his car's inspection hatch and rearranged radio cables. They subsequently removed a data transmitter which was the cause the blockage and Häkkinen rejoined in 9th. Trulli became the next retirement of the race when he <b>pulled</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> side of the track with a gearbox problem on the following lap.|$|E
5|$|De la Rosa and Irvine {{qualified}} in {{ninth and}} eleventh positions respectively for Jaguar; the pair {{were separated by}} Trulli in the Jordan who's engine failed on his third run {{and was unable to}} return to the pit lane to use his team's spare car. The three drivers were ahead of Villeneuve in the faster of the two BAR cars, who in turn, qualified in front of teammate Panis; both drivers struggled to find grip throughout the one-hour period. Alesi qualified in 14th position, more than four tenths of a second in front of Prost teammate Luciano Burti; the latter spun off in the circuit's stadium section which caused a yellow flag to be shown. The two were split by Zonta in the slower Jordan car who drove over a kerb at the Senna chicane on his third run of the session which lost him time and he encountered slower cars. The Benetton cars filled the ninth row of the grid with Fisichella 17th and Button 18th; the latter's car had its gearbox changed and <b>pulled</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> side of the track with a failed engine. Behind them, the Arrows drivers managed to qualify in 18th and 19th; Enrique Bernoldi qualifying ahead of Jos Verstappen. Bernoldi improved his car's handling although his potential best run was disrupted because of Button's engine failure and Verstappen spun on his final timed lap. The starting order was completed by Fernando Alonso and Tarso Marques in the Minardi cars.|$|E
5|$|Häkkinen {{retired from}} the race when he slowed and later <b>pulled</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> side of the track with fluid leaking from his engine on lap 14. His {{retirement}} allowed Räikkonen {{to move into the}} first points-scoring position of sixth. By lap 15, Montoya had a lead of 8.3 seconds over Ralf Schumacher, who in turn was 3.3 seconds in front of Barrichello. Michael Schumacher was a further 9.2 seconds behind his Ferrari teammate, but was drawing ahead of Coulthard in fifth. Barrichello and Panis were the first drivers to make scheduled pit stops on lap 16. The Ferrari and Williams teams were employing different pit stop strategies – the Ferrari were planning a two stop strategy for Barrichello whereas the Williams team were only planning for one stop. Räikkonen slowed on track with an driveshaft failure but managed to return to the pit lane and retire on the same lap, while Irvine retired with an misfiring engine. Two laps later, Burti lost tenth position after he spun and was passed by Trulli and Panis. Barrichello attempted to get past Coulthard for fourth position on lap 19, but Coulthard moved onto a defensive line to keep the position. Montoya continued to pull away from Ralf Schumacher—setting the race's fastest lap of 1:41.808 on lap 20—to maintain his first position after his one and only pit stop. Barrichello was able to overtake Coulthard at the Agip corner on the same lap.|$|E

25|$|Yet {{as he did}} so, the front-running pair of Rubens Barrichello's Jordan and Nigel Mansell's Williams came up to lap him.

25|$|A scoop shot (also {{known as}} a ramp shot, paddle scoop, Marillier shot or Dilscoop) {{has been used by}} a number of {{first-class}} batsmen, the first being Dougie Marillier.

He first performed the escape in New York's East River on July 7, 1912. Police forbade him from {{using one of the}} piers, so he hired a tugboat and invited press on board. Houdini was locked in handcuffs and leg-irons, then nailed into the crate which was roped and weighed down with two hundred pounds of lead. The crate was then lowered into the water. He escaped in 57 seconds. The crate was <b>pulled</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface and found still to be intact, with the manacles inside.|$|E

25|$|Chasteler spotted Dombrowski's {{outflanking}} {{column and}} directed Bagration's troops against it. Dombrowski's division seized Rivalta and advanced up the Trebbia's west bank {{as far as}} the hamlet of Canetto before they ran into the Russians. Accompanied in person by Suvorov, the Russians defeated their mostly Polish opponents with serious losses and forced them to retreat to the east bank. Rusca's initial advance was blunted by the fire of 14 artillery pieces belonging to Schveikovsky's division. Farther north, Victor's division was repulsed by a combination of Schveikovsky's left wing and Förster's division and withdrew to the French-held east bank. But with Bagration's forces <b>pulled</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south by Dombrowski's ill-fated attack, Rusca's men found a gap in the Allied line south of Casaliggio. The French infantry charged across the Trebbia while a horse artillery battery mauled the Rosenberg Grenadier Regiment. Suvorov appeared on the scene to rally his Russians. Rosenberg swung the left wing of Schveikovsky's division to face the northern edge of Rusca's breakthrough while Bagration hurried north to hit the southern edge. At the same time, Chasteler borrowed four battalions from Förster and brought them to the scene. The combined attack forced Rusca's division to retire to the east bank. The Russians tried to follow up their success but Rusca's men repelled their attacks and the fighting in the south ended around 7:00 pm.|$|E
25|$|Marciello set {{what was}} at that point a new fastest lap of the race as he drew closer to Rosenqvist. Ocon could not resist a {{challenge}} from Sainz and lost tenth while the struggling Jaafar was overtaken by Korjus on the next lap. Mason was black-flagged as he opted to continue racing and not take his penalty. Rosenqvist concentrated on not allowing Marciello get close to him while Félix da Costa and Derani was waiting to capitalise on any mistakes. Sainz gained a further place by overtaking Coletti for ninth. Giovinazzi battled Gelael for seventeenth with ended in Giovinazzi's favour. Giovanazzi then gained a further place by getting ahead of Wolf for sixteenth. Coletti lost ninth to Ocon in the closing stages of the race while Korjus <b>pulled</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> side of the track at Fisherman's Bend with smoke bellowing from his engine. Lynn opened up a two-second advantage over {{the rest of the field}} and maintained the lead to win the qualification race and pole position for the main race. He was joined on the front row by Rosenqvist while Marciello completed the podium in spite of being caught by the former as Rosenqvist felt a loss in tyre grip. Behind the two, Félix da Costa followed with Derani in fifth. Sims, King and Bulller were in close formation for positions six to eight and Sainz and Ocon completed the top ten. Coletti, Jaafar, Latifil, Sekiguchi, Giovnazzi, Wolf, Gelael, Nakayama, Chiyo, Bryant-Meisner, Sun, Mason and Korjus rounded out the classified finishers.|$|E
