40|$|AbstractThe Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS), {{founded in}} April 2008, is Singapore's {{national}} laboratory for applied solar energy research. The institute conducts industry-oriented {{research and development}} (R&D) as well as use-inspired basic {{research in the field}} of solar energy conversion. A cornerstone of the silicon wafer solar cell R&D at SERIS is a <b>pilot</b> <b>line</b> based on industrial equipment. SERIS has worked closely with industrial equipment vendors to build a <b>pilot</b> <b>line</b> that combines the flexibility required for R&D with the throughputs and process robustness required for production. By utilising industrial equipment SERIS is able to conduct industry relevant research with a direct roadmap to production, by rapid prototyping of novel solar cell structures and processes using production-proven tooling. The approach removes the need to migrate processes from lab-scale tools to the production environment, which commonly limits lab-to-production technology transfer and increases the risk of technology transfer. Moreover, SERIS’ industrial <b>pilot</b> <b>line</b> focuses not only on device-oriented R&D but also enables R&D programmes with equipment manufacturers to test new process tool prototypes and extend the capabilities of existing tool designs. The <b>pilot</b> <b>line</b> has been established on a short timeline and has quickly achieved good average efficiencies with standard industrial Al-BSF solar cells: 16. 7 % for multi-Si and 18. 2 % for mono-Si. This paper presents an overview of SERIS’ R&D <b>pilot</b> <b>line</b> for silicon wafer solar cells and its capabilities.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{increasing}} use of sensors in mobile hydraulic equipment, the need for hydraulic <b>pilot</b> <b>lines</b> is decreasing, being replaced by electrical wiring and electrically con-trollable components. For controlling some of the existing hydraulic components there are, however, still a need for being able to generate a hydraulic pilot pressure. In this paper con-trolling a hydraulic variable pump is considered. The LS-pressure is measured electrically and the hydraulic pilot pressure is generated using a small spool valve. From a control point of view there are two approaches for controlling this system, by either generating a copy of the LS-pressure, the LS-pressure being the output, or letting the output be the pump pressure. The focus of the current paper is on the controller design based on the first approach. Specif-ically a controlled leakage flow is used to avoid the need for a switching control structure. ...|$|E

Key {{enabling}} technologies (KETs) could be a crucial part of the EU’s response to the economic crisis over the past decade. More jobs and growth are expected from investments in KETs, hoping they may lead to a more prosperous society through higher skills and wages, while expanding innovative high technology exports globally. Consequently, KETs, especially the five ICT KETs examined in the following chapters, should be seen as having a strategic social importance. The initiative will catalyse not only product innovation but also the industrial process. Moving from innovation to commercialisation in a three-pillar model (RDI, <b>pilot</b> <b>lines,</b> and then full commercialisation) is its fundamental advantage over previous innovation programmes. It may assure the success of the EU’s future global competitive position, as it can stimulate high levels of skilled employment.

40|$|Abstract – The ePIXnet silicon {{photonics}} platform offers {{open access}} to CMOS fabrication facilities {{for research and}} prototyping of silicon photonic integrated circuits. Through cost sharing, the cost can be made affordable. Based on the technology in this platform, important achievements in silicon photonics have been reached. FACILITY ACCESS PROGRAMME The silicon photonics platform offers access to the CMOS <b>pilot</b> <b>lines</b> of IMEC (Belgium) and CEA-LETI (France) for fabrication of silicon photonic circuits. Fabrication is done using stable and known wafer-scale processes, including deep UV lithography. Through cost sharing, a large reduction in the cost per user can be obtained, reaching a level that affordable for research labs and start-up companies. The platform is ideally suited for research and prototyping {{of a lot of}} different structures or large scale photonic integrated circuits. As the user gets a full wafer of chips, a lot of material is available for post-processing. Also, an automatic feature size variation can be obtained over the wafer if desired, through variation of the exposure dose during lithography. Mask cost, processing cost, the cost of mask checking and integration and post-processing such as thinning and dicing, are all shared by the users signing in to a fabrication run. In this way, a large cost reduction is obtained. This is only possible {{through the use of a}} electronic IC fabrication environment. The cost per user is reduced b...|$|E

All the partners have capabilities for computational Materials Science, whereas the HZ Berlin and University of Jena have <b>pilot</b> <b>lines</b> for CIGS processes. Schott AG mainly concentrates on optimization and production of specialty glass substrates for CIGS manufacturing.

40|$|There is {{a strong}} demand for stand alone actinic tools for high volume {{manufacturing}} of EUV mask infrastructure. Among such metrology tools reflectometry, blank inspection, mask defect and pattern inspection are of special {{need to be in}} <b>pilot</b> <b>lines</b> of EUVL roadmaps expected to prepare production in 2012 to 213. With existing lab sources and metrology tool technology we expect to make significant contributions. With the existing EUV-reflectometer developed for mask blank characterization accuracies of < 0. 1 % in peak reflectivity precision and 0. 002 nm for centroid wavelength (CWL- 50. 1) are routinely achieved on both reflective multilayer coated and absorbers coated blanks. Furthermore, new upgrades for fiducial mark detection in the reflectometer allow for measurements on structured masks with precise positioning (better than 50 m). Meanwhile, detail studies on reproducibility and sensibility of measurement versus tilt angle have been performed. These studies shows le ss than 1 % change in peak reflectometry due to 500 rad tilt, while accuracy of alignment is < 100 rad.

40|$|Plans to {{introduce}} <b>pilot</b> <b>lines</b> or fabs for 300 mm processing are in progress. The IC technology is simultaneously moving towards 0. 25 / 0. 18 micron. The convergence {{of these two}} trends places unprecedented stringent demands on processes and equipments. More than ever, computational modeling is called upon to play a complementary role in equipment and process design. The pace in hardware/process development needs a matching pace in software development: an aggressive move towards developing "virtual reactors" is desirable and essential to reduce design cycle and costs. This goal has three elements: reactor scale model, feature level model, and database of physical/chemical properties. With these elements coupled, the complete model should function as a design aid in a CAD environment. This talk would aim at the description of various elements. At the reactor level, continuum, DSMC(or particle) and hybrid models will be discussed and compared using examples of plasma and thermal process simulations. In microtopography evolution, approaches such as level set methods compete with conventional geometric models. Regardless of the approach, the reliance on empricism is to be eliminated through coupling to reactor model and computational surface science. This coupling poses challenging issues of orders of magnitude variation in length and time scales. Finally, database development has fallen behind; current situation is rapidly aggravated by the ever newer chemistries emerging to meet process metrics. The virtual reactor would be a useless concept without an accompanying reliable database that consists of: thermal reaction pathways and rate constants, electron-molecule cross sections, thermochemical properties, transport properties, and finally, surface data on the interaction of radicals, atoms and ions with various surfaces. Large scale computational chemistry efforts are critical as experiments alone cannot meet database needs due to the difficulties associated with such controlled experiments and costs...|$|E

The Machinery Directive 2006 / 42 /EC (MD) - transposed into the respective national legislations -is the European regulatory framework for the design and construction of new machinery, as the future PPLs. PPLs are not required to comply with the provisions of the MD until they are put into service - expected in 2020, after project completion - but then, the MD will be fully applicable. In this regulatory context, the project PLATFORM is aligning the design of the PPLs according to the MD requirements, in order to facilitate the CE marking in 2020 (TRL 9) and avoid potential economic costs associated with future re-adaptations or modifications needed to ensure compliance with the MD. This paper discusses the methodological approach followed by the project PLATFORM to integrate all the nanosafety aspects in the design of the PPLs, in order to achieve safe designs in conformity with the relevant Essential Health and Safety Requirements (EHSRs) of the MD. Since machinery must be designed and constructed taking into account the results of the risk assessment (RA), this paper describes the systematic and iterative approach for RA and risk reduction followed to eliminate hazards as far practicable and to adequately reduce risks by the implementation of protective measures. This process has been guided by the harmonized standards EN ISO 12100 and EN ISO 14123, taking the relevant phases of life cycle, expected uses and operation modes of the PPLs into account. A specific tool to guide the safe design of the PPLs and facilitate the RA process has also been produced by the project (PLATFORM -SbD toolkit).

40|$|Advanced Materials {{is one of}} the Key Enabling 3 Technologies {{identified}} by the European Commission 1. Together with Advanced Manufacturing it underpins almost all other Key Enabling and Industrial Technologies. The basic science and engineering research that results in the development of Advanced Materials lies within the field of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE). The transfer of knowledge from basic research into final products and applications in the field of MSE involves certain MSE-typical motifs and specific issues, as well as certain aspects that are special to Europe. In comparison with underlying traditional (or basic) disciplines such as physics, chemistry or biology, MSE involves a range of aspects that are more characteristic of applied science, where relevance has equal importance to curiosity in order to drive the research effort and justify expenditure – the defined goals often being a proven innovative technology or indeed a particular product. MSE and the related transfer of knowledge and technology includes consideration of factors such as materials and product life cycles, the abundance of materials, the technical, ecological and economic feasibility of materials engineering and processing, as well as the multidisciplinarity of the ‘background’ knowledge and the efficiency of the academic effort involved. This is even more the case for situations that involve successful validation of technologies and effective transfer of knowledge between academia and industry. The state of knowledge and technology transfer in Europe differs from that of other global players, such as the US, China or Japan. Europe’s cultural diversity gives rise to both positive and negative factors. Positive aspects include the high standard of general education and Europe’s highly skilled work force (for both technical and academic staff), and the flexibility and variety of research topics and directions. Major negative factors are the fragmentation of national research efforts, and the lack of a European mechanism to create critical mass in new technologies and to invest in <b>pilot</b> <b>lines.</b> These negative issues are manifested by the fragmentation of research programmes, the lack of venture capital and a general risk aversion on the part of investors in Europe, in particular {{in the light of the}} current economic crisis in Europe. The present situation has often been described as a malfunctioning interface between strong basic research and poor, inefficient technological development and commercial exploitation of knowledge. MSE spans this interface. ‘European’ knowledge is world-class, and even leads the world in certain fundamental areas of MSE, for example in the investigation and understanding of materials properties, the development and application of new concepts of materials design, computational materials sciences, and several other fields. However, Europe’s MSE knowledge and technological progress will not readily lead to the establishment of new technologies and products by European industries without dedicated intervention. This knowledge must be delicately directed in a highly impact-oriented way. To accelerate development and validation of technological applications and the introduction of technological innovation into the market, to intensify the collaboration between academic institutions and industry in Europe, and to facilitate the creation of spin-out companies and new industrial–academic career paths, MatSEEC recommends the creation of European Technology Research and Validation Platforms (ETVPs). Such platforms would provide powerful tools for innovation and allow better protection of intellectual property rights in Europe. We recommend the creation of an ‘Open-Access-Open-Innovation’ European Technology Research and Validation Infrastructure Initiative to streamline and improve technology and knowledge transfer in Europe. The initiative would be dedicated to technology research and validation. It could be based on a similar model to the current Integrated Infrastructure Initiatives (I 3 s) for research infrastructures of the European Commission (the I 3 Programme in H 2020 and the Seventh Framework Programme,FP 7) ...|$|E
