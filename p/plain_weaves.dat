40|$|An {{analytical}} model is presented for the compressive behaviour of <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabric composites under on-axis uniaxial loading. Analysis {{is based on}} curved beams on elastic foundation approach. The contributions of all the three structural elements within the <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabric composite, namely longitudinal strand, transverse strand and pure matrix region have been considered. During compressive loading, the load sharing between structural elements is worked out and the stress state throughout the composite is determined. Effect of failed structural elements is taken into account for further calculations. Compressive strength, modulus of elasticity and failure strain data has been generated for different fabric geometries for both <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabric E-glass/epoxy and T 300 carbon/epoxy composites.

50|$|The sheen and softer feel of sateen is {{produced}} through the satin weave structure. Warp yarns are floated over weft yarns, for example four over and one under. (In a weft-faced satin or sateen, the weft yarns are floated over the warp yarns.) Standard <b>plain</b> <b>weaves</b> use a one-over, one-under structure. The long floats produce a surface that is smooth {{to the touch}} and reduces light scattering to increase shine. This weave structure is more susceptible to wear than other weaves.|$|E

50|$|Ends {{per inch}} is very {{commonly}} used by weavers who must use {{the number of}} ends per inch in order to pick the right reed to weave with. The number of ends per inch varies on the pattern to be woven and {{the thickness of the}} thread. <b>Plain</b> <b>weaves</b> generally use half the number of warps per inch for the number of ends per inch, whereas denser weaves like a twill weave will use a higher ratio like two thirds of the number of warps per inch. Finer threads require more threads per inch than thick ones, and thus result in a higher number of ends per inch.|$|E

40|$|Techniques were {{developed}} and described for performing three-dimensional {{finite element analysis}} of plain weave composites. Emphasized here are aspects of the analysis which are different from analysis of traditional laminated composites, such as the mesh generation and representative unit cells. The {{analysis was used to}} study several different variations of <b>plain</b> <b>weaves</b> which illustrate the effects of tow waviness on composite moduli, Poisson's ratios, and internal strain distributions. In-plane moduli decreased almost linearly with increasing tow waviness. The tow waviness was shown to cause large normal and shear strain concentrations in composites subjected to uniaxial load. These strain concentrations may lead to earlier damage initiation than occurs in traditional cross-ply laminates...|$|E

Rouge Mistral employed a tufting textile fabrication technique where narrow strips of discarded textiles scraps were pushed up {{through an open}} weave textile (discarded burlap coffee bean sack) forming loops {{on the right side}} of the cape. The tufted design of the cape was inspired by the strong Mistral wind that blows from southern France into the Gulf of Lion. The dress portion of the ensemble was strategically designed and draped for maximum utilization of remaining discarded textiles. Side panels of dress were shaped with curved seams to compliment the Mistral swirling influence in the cape. A variety of textiles were utilized in this design: natural, synthetic, and blended fibers in knits, <b>plain</b> <b>weaves,</b> lace, and netting to name a few.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} the influence of weave structures and silica coatings obtained via sol-gel process on the thermal insulation properties of cotton samples. For this reason three main <b>weave</b> structures (<b>plain,</b> satin, and piqué) of cotton fabric were selected with different yarn count, threads per cm, and mass per square meter values. Thereafter, only for the <b>plain</b> <b>weave,</b> the samples were padded using silica sol formed by hydrolysis and subsequent condensation of 3 -glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane under acidic conditions. The silanized <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> samples were characterized by TGA and FT-IR techniques. The thermal properties were measured with a home-made apparatus in order to calculate thermal conductivity, resistance, and absorption of all the treated fabric samples. The relationship between the thermal insulation properties of the <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabrics and the concentration of sol solutions has been investigated. Fabrics weave and density were found to strongly influence the thermal properties: piqué always shows the lowest values and satin shows the highest values while <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> lies in between. The thermal properties of treated high-density cotton <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabric were proved to be strongly influenced by finishing agent concentration...|$|R

40|$|Most {{commercial}} available {{natural fibre}} composites {{are based on}} random discontinuous fibre composite systems. The development of continuous natural fibre reinforced polymers is essential for manufacturing materials {{that can be used}} in load bearing applications. Similar to traditional composite polymer materials, high-performance natural fibre composite systems should be based on continuous textile reinforcements like unidirectional tapes or woven fabrics. The first problem to be addressed in this process is the optimisation of the yarn to be used in the manufacturing of the textile reinforcement. Subsequently, a number of different fabric types (i. e. biaxial <b>plain</b> <b>weaves,</b> unidirectional fabrics and non-crimp fabrics) were produced and evaluated as reinforcement in composites manufactured by well established manufacturing techniques such as hand lay-up, vacuum infusion, pultrusion and resin transfer moulding (RTM). As expected, the developed materials can not directly compete in terms of strength with unidirectional glass fibre composites. However, they are clearly able to compete with these materials in terms of stiffness, especially if the low density of flax is taken into account. High mechanical properties were obtained for unidirectional flax composite material...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 6 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 30 June - 2 July, 2008. It {{is well known that}} thermal conductivity of fabric is mainly influenced by their porosity. The fabric porosity is a function of construction parameters such as yarn fineness and set of weft and warp. The ideal volume porosity can be computed from basic fabric parameters and the structure of elementary cell. The main aim of this work is the creation of simple mechanistic model for the prediction of fabric thermal conductivity from basic fabric properties such as yarn diameters, weft and warp sett, planar weight and thickness of fabric. This model is in fact the combination of air conductivity and conductivity of fibrous phase in hierarchy fibers, yarn and fabric. The experimentally obtained thermal conductivities of 27 wool/PET <b>plain</b> <b>weaves</b> with constant sett of warp and varying sett of weft and varying yarn fineness are used for checking of the predictive ability of this model. vk 201...|$|E
40|$|Modelling {{the forming}} process of {{engineering}} fabrics and textile composites using a mechanical approach, such as FEM, requires characterisation of material behaviour. Using Picture Frame (PF) tests, several {{previous studies have}} reported a coupling between in-plane tension and fabric shear compliance. However, characterising this behaviour accurately has proven problematic due to {{the sensitivity of the}} PF test to small fabric misalignments in the test rig, prompting innovative solutions {{such as the use of}} load-cells mounted on the side bars of the PF rig to measure in-plane tension during testing. This paper focuses on an alternative testing technique, the Biaxial Bias Extension test, as a means to investigate this coupling. The approach has several benefits including simple equipment requirements, the ability to vary sample dimensions and boundary conditions. The main difficulty lies in extracting the material contribution to the recorded signal. To do this, an experimental method is demonstrated using two very different textiles; glass fabric and self-reinforced polypropylene both <b>plain</b> <b>weaves.</b> The latter is challenging to characterise and was chosen due to its high propensity to wrinkle at room temperature...|$|E
