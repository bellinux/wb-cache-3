2500|$|The {{two most}} common forms of herpes {{are caused by}} {{infection}} with herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV-1 is typically acquired orally and causes cold sores, HSV-2 is usually acquired during sexual contact and affects the genitals, however either strain may affect either site. Some people are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms. Those that do experience symptoms usually notice them 2 to 20 days after exposure which last 2 to 4 weeks. Symptoms can include small fluid-filled blisters, headaches, backaches, itching or tingling sensations in the genital or anal area, <b>pain</b> <b>during</b> <b>urination,</b> Flu like symptoms, swollen glands, or fever. Herpes is spread through skin contact with a person infected with the virus. The virus affects the areas where it entered the body. This can occur through kissing, vaginal intercourse, oral sex or anal sex. The virus is most infectious during times when there are visible symptoms, however those who are asymptomatic can still spread the virus through skin contact. The primary attack is the most severe because the body {{does not have any}} antibodies built up. After the primary attack, one might have recurring attacks that are milder or might not even have future attacks. There is no cure for the disease but there are antiviral medications that treat its symptoms and lower the risk of transmission (Valtrex). Although HSV-1 is typically the [...] "oral" [...] version of the virus, and HSV-2 is typically the [...] "genital" [...] version of the virus, a person with HSV-1 orally CAN transmit that virus to their partner genitally. The virus, either type, will settle into a nerve bundle either {{at the top of the}} spine, producing the [...] "oral" [...] outbreak, or a second nerve bundle at the base of the spine, producing the genital outbreak.|$|E
50|$|Common {{symptoms}} of urethral diverticulum include incontinence, urinary frequency and urgency, pain during sex, and <b>pain</b> <b>during</b> <b>urination.</b> Other symptoms include pain localized to the urethra or pelvis and frequent urinary tract infection.|$|E
50|$|Bladder outlet {{obstruction}} (BOO) can {{be caused}} by BPH. Symptoms are abdominal pain, a continuous feeling of a full bladder, frequent urination, acute urinary retention (inability to urinate), <b>pain</b> <b>during</b> <b>urination</b> (dysuria), problems starting urination (urinary hesitancy), slow urine flow, starting and stopping (urinary intermittency), and nocturia.|$|E
50|$|The {{symptoms}} of vaginal thrush include vulval itching, vulval soreness and irritation, <b>pain</b> or discomfort <b>during</b> sexual intercourse (superficial dyspareunia), <b>pain</b> or discomfort <b>during</b> <b>urination</b> (dysuria) and vaginal discharge, {{which is usually}} odourless. This can be thin and watery, or thick and white, like cottage cheese.|$|R

50|$|Urinary tract {{infection}} is predominantly caused by bacteria. Symptoms include the strong and frequent sensation or urge to urinate, <b>pain</b> <b>during</b> <b>urination,</b> and urine that is cloudy. The main causal agent is Escherichia coli. Urine is typically sterile but contains {{a variety of}} salts, and waste products. Bacteria can ascend into the bladder or kidney and causing cystitis and nephritis.|$|E
50|$|Other {{possible}} {{symptoms include}} <b>pain</b> <b>during</b> <b>urination,</b> frequent urination, or feeling {{the need to}} urinate {{without being able to}} do so. These signs and symptoms are not specific to bladder cancer, and are also caused by non-cancerous conditions, including prostate infections, over-active bladder and cystitis. There are many other causes of hematuria, such as bladder or ureteric stones, infection, kidney disease, kidney cancers and vascular malformations.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{estimated}} that more than 130 million girls and {{women around the world}} have undergone genital mutilation. At least 2 million girls are at risk every year. The cutting, which is generally done without anesthetic, may have lifelong health consequences including chronic infection, severe <b>pain</b> <b>during</b> <b>urination,</b> menstruation, sexual intercourse, and childbirth, and psychological trauma. Some girls die from the cutting, usually as a result of bleeding or infection.

30|$|Urinary system {{diseases}} in pediatric practice comprise {{a broad spectrum}} of various pathological disorders. The most common urinary system disease in children and adolescents is a urinary tract infection (UTI), which {{is also one of the}} most frequent pediatric infections in general. The clinical manifestations of UTIs vary from general signs (e.g. fever, vomiting, refusing food, irritability) to specific urinary manifestations (e.g. frequent <b>urination,</b> <b>pain</b> and burning <b>during</b> <b>urination,</b> urinary incontinence) [1, 2]. UTIs, primarily pyelonephritis, may result in kidney damage with long-term complications such as hypertension, impaired renal function, and end-stage chronic kidney diseases. Timely diagnosis and effective treatment of UTIs may prevent severe disorders and long-term complications in patients with recurrent infections [1, 2].|$|R
40|$|In an open study, 172 {{male and}} female adult {{patients}} with acute uncomplicated bacterial cystitis were randomly allocated to three treatment groups. Two groups received brodimoprim 200 mg tablets as follows: a single dose of two 200 mg tablets on day 1, followed by one tablet per day on days 2 and 3 (58 patients); or a single daily dose of two tablets, for 2 days (63 patients). The third group received a single dose of pefloxacin, as two 400 mg tablets, for 1 day (51 patients). Complete urinalysis, sediment and urine culture examinations were carried out before treatment and 10 days after the last dose. Evaluation also comprised, {{at the time of}} enrolment and 48 h after the last dose, measurement of corporal temperature and assessment of symptoms (dysuria, pollakiuria, strangury, suprapubic <b>pain,</b> burning sensation <b>during</b> <b>urination</b> and urgency) on a 4 -point scale. The eradication rate for the pathogen concerned was 98. 3 % and 96. 7 % in the groups receiving brodimoprim for 3 and 2 days, respectively, and 92. 8 % in the pefloxacin group (between-group comparison n. s.). There was significant regression of symptoms (P < 0. 001) in the three groups (between-groups comparison n. s.). Mainly gastrointestinal adverse events occurred in 3 patients receiving brodimoprim for 2 days and in 4 patients from each of the other two groups...|$|R

50|$|In {{the context}} of lesions of the mucous {{membrane}} lining of the bladder, leukoplakia is a historic term used to describe a visualized white patch which histologically represents keratinization {{in an area of}} squamous metaplasia. The symptoms may include frequency, suprapubic pain (pain felt above the pubis), hematuria (blood in the urine), dysuria (difficult urination or <b>pain</b> <b>during</b> <b>urination),</b> urgency, and urge incontinence. The white lesion may be seen during cystoscopy, where it appears as a whitish-gray or yellow lesion, on a background of inflamed urothelium and there may be floating debris in the bladder. Leukoplakia of the bladder may undergo malignant transformation, so biopsy and long term follow up are usually indicated.|$|E
50|$|A vaginal yeast {{infection}} results from overgrowth of candida albicans, or yeast, in the vagina. This is a relatively common infection, with over 75% of women having experienced at least one {{yeast infection}} {{at some point in}} their life. Risk factors for yeast infections include recent antibiotic use, diabetes, immunosuppression, increased estrogen levels, and use of certain contraceptive devices including intrauterine devices, diaphragms, or sponges. It is not a sexually transmitted infection. Candida vaginal infections are common; an estimated 75% of women will have at least one yeast infection in their lifetime. Vaginal discharge is not always present in yeast infections, but when occurring it is typically odorless, thick, white, and clumpy. Vaginal itching is the most common symptom of candida vulvovaginitis. Women may also experience burning, soreness, irritation, <b>pain</b> <b>during</b> <b>urination,</b> or pain during sex. The diagnosis of Candida vulvovaginitis is made by looking at a sample taken from the vagina under the microscope that shows hyphae (yeast), or from a culture. It is important to note that the symptoms described above may be present in other vaginal infections, so microscopic diagnosis or culture is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is with intra-vaginal or oral anti-fungal medications.|$|E

40|$|Background and ObjectiveIn {{the women}} with chronic renal {{insufficiency}} ovulation is suppressed therefore they rarely become pregnant. If pregnancy occurs, they might encounter many conflictions. It may lead to death (fetus or mother). The {{aim of this study}} was reporting a successful pregnancy in a patient with advanced chronic renal insufficiency. Case reportThe patient was a 32 years old woman with long period of infertility (8 years). The first main clinical symptom was abdominal pain especially in hypogastric area as well as hyperuremia, elevated levels of creatinine (2. 9 mg/dl), mild proteinuria and hematuria. The urine specific gravity was 1010. Sonography data showed asymmetrical small kidneys. Other complaints were pruritus and flank <b>pain</b> <b>during</b> <b>urination.</b> The primary diagnosis was chronic renal failure due to probable chronic pyelonephritis. After an interval she returned with positive pregnancy test. She decided to continue the pregnancy in despite of obstetrician belief for aborting. During pregnancy, proteinuria reached to two plus, hemoglobin fell to 9. 7, creatinine levels reached to 3. 7 mg/dl and blood pressure was fluctuating between 110 / 80 and 130 / 85 mmHg. She admitted in the hospital in third trimester of pregnancy because of preterm labor. However the pain was suppressed after starting magnesium sulfate infusion.

Case Report A 53 -year-old man referred to our unit due to severe pancytopenia and splenomegaly. He had the history of <b>pain</b> <b>during</b> <b>urination</b> and hematuria for the last 2 years. He admitted to a urologist and bladder malignancy had been thought with abdominopelvic ultrasonographic examination. This US showed bladder wall thickness at the right-lower portion and massive splenomegaly with space occupying lesions in it, and it had been reported as BC and massive splenomegaly, probably spleen metastasis due to BC. PET/CT had been done and it showed thickening in bladder wall and splenomegaly with homogenous, low FDG uptake. TUR had been performed due to BC by his urologist. After surgery, Mitomycin C instillation was given weekly for 4 weeks and one injection in every six months for four times is then given. After these he admitted to our unit with pancytopenia and splenomegaly. His personal history was interesting for chemical exposure: he was interested with music and he was guitar player for years.

40|$|Chlamydia are Gram-negative {{bacteria}} that grow within the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. They are not cultivated in artificial media but only intracellularly since they lack suitable support mechanisms. The eukaryotic cell is their source of metabolic energy, {{so they are}} considered obligate intracellular parasites. According to the new classification the Chlamydiales lineage is separated into four families: the Chlamydiaceae, Simkaniaceae, Parachlamydiaceae and Waddliaceae. The family Chlamydiaceae includes two genera: the genus Chlamydia and the genus Chlamydophila. The genus Chlamydia includes Chlamydia trachomatis while the genus Chlamydophila includes Chlamydophila pneumoniae, C. psittaci, C. pecorum, C. felis, C. caviae and C. abortus. C. trachomatis contains 15 serotypes: serotypes A, B, Ba, and C are the cause of trachoma. Serotypes D-K are the aetiologic agents of nongonococcal urethritis, epididymitis, cervicitis, vaginitis, and inclusion conjunctivitis. Serotypes A-K are also known as TRIC (Trachoma - Inclusion Conjunctivitis). Finally, serotypes L 1, L 2 and L 3 are the cause of lymphogranuloma venereum. The clinical picture of urethritis due to C. trachomatis includes mild dysuria, clear discharge from the urethra and <b>pain</b> <b>during</b> <b>urination.</b> Microscopy reveals the absence of Gram-negative intracellular diplococci {{and the presence of}} leukocytes. The reference gold standard method for the diagnosis of C. trachomatis urethritis is the cell culture. Molecular methods, such as the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) {{play an important role in}} the diagnosis of C. trachomatis infection; nowadays these techniques are considered as the most sensitive method for the diagnosis of C. trachomatis infection. Their great advantage is their application to non-invasive samples, such as urine, vaginal discharge and intravaginal tampons. The present study includes two parts. The aim of the first part was the evaluation of the molecular techniques for the detection of C. trachomatis in symptomatic men with urethritis: intra-urethral swab (IS), penile skin swab (PSS), perineal swab (PS), rectal swab (RS) and first void urine (FVU) were examined. Also, cervical swab (CS), high vaginal swab (HVS), perineal swab (PS), vulvar swab (VS) and first void urine (FVU) were tested in symptomatic women with vaginitis. In the second part of this study the distribution of C. trachomatis serotypes was studied in order to describe the epidemiology of nongonococcal urethritis due to C. trachomatis in Greece. Between September 2005 and September 2006, a total of 210 male and 60 female patients were enrolled in the study. These patients were referred to the Outpatient Department of the Sexually Transmitted Diseases clinic of the “Andreas Sygros” Hospital, in Athens, Greece, with acute nongonococcal urethritis and vaginitis respectively. According to the protocol the samples were studied using two Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs). The PCR Amplicor CT (Roche Molecular Inc.) was used at the Microbiology Department of the ‘A Sygros’ Hospital and a home made nested-PCR at the Unit of Molecular Diagnosis of Bacterial Infections at Department of Microbiology, Medical School, University of Athens.
