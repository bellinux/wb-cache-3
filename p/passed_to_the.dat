5|$|The castle {{was most}} likely built for John Harington, 1st Baron Harington in the 14th century, {{replacing}} nearby Aldingham Motte. Gleaston Castle descended through the Harrington family until 1458 when it passed to William Bonville through marriage and was subsequently abandoned. The castle <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Grey family until Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk was executed for treason in 1554. As a result, Gleaston Castle became royal property before it was bought by the Preston family in the 17th century, and then <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cavendish family.|$|E

5|$|After re-intensifying into a {{tropical}} storm for a second time, Helene <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southeast of Atlantic Canada.

5|$|As Josephine <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{south of}} the Cape Verde islands on September2, outer rain bands {{produced}} minor rainfall, totaling around 0.55inches (14mm). There were no reports of damage or flooding from the rain and overall effects were minor.|$|E
5|$|As {{only one}} of the {{electrons}} can be transferred from the QH2 donor to a cytochrome c acceptor at a time, the reaction mechanism of complex III is more elaborate than those of the other respiratory complexes, and occurs in two steps called the Q cycle. In the first step, the enzyme binds three substrates, first, QH2, which is then oxidized, with one electron being <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second substrate, cytochrome c. The two protons released from QH2 pass into the intermembrane space. The third substrate is Q, which accepts the second electron from the QH2 and is reduced to Q.−, which is the ubisemiquinone free radical. The first two substrates are released, but this ubisemiquinone intermediate remains bound. In the second step, a second molecule of QH2 is bound and again passes its first electron to a cytochrome c acceptor. The second electron is <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bound ubisemiquinone, reducing it to QH2 as it gains two protons from the mitochondrial matrix. This QH2 is then released from the enzyme.|$|E

5|$|Because of a weak–moderate La Niña episode, most {{tropical}} cyclones {{that developed}} within the season occurred within the Coral Sea.

During December 24, Tropical Cyclone Gertie moved into the basin from the Australian region, before it <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south of New Caledonia and weakened below tropical cyclone intensity.|$|E

The defender now denying <b>the</b> <b>pass</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> high post now has <b>to</b> deny <b>passes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> high post, wing and cross court.

5|$|Crewe was {{the seat}} of the de Crewe (or de Criwa) family in the 12th and 13th centuries; they built a timber-framed manor house there in around 1170. The manor <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> de Praers family of Barthomley in 1319 by the {{marriage}} of Johanna de Crewe to Richard de Praers. Later in the 14th century it <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Fouleshurst (or Foulehurst) family, who held the manor jointly with that of Barthomley until around 1575, when the estate was dispersed. Legal problems resulted in the lands being acquired by Sir Christopher Hatton, from whose heirs Sir Randolph Crewe (1559–1646) purchased an extensive estate including the manors of Crewe, Barthomley and Haslington in 1608 for over £6,000 (£ today).|$|E

Beach facilities at Curaçao's Piscadera and Vaersen Bays suffered considerable damage. Quays along the harbor entrance were also damaged.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, a Mr Bowker from Shawford {{successfully}} {{applied for}} the towpath to be diverted, but this was overturned when Rev. J H Du Boulay appealed against the decision. The diversion was sanctioned in 1914, {{although there have been}} doubts about the legality of the action, and subsequently two further diversions were made, at Chickenhall, near the southern end and at Hockley, near the northern end. No maintenance was carried out on the waterway until the formation of Catchment Boards. Thus responsibility for the waterway as a drainage channel <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hampshire Catchment Board in 1942, and some work was carried out to maintain the integrity of the waterway. These responsibilities later <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Southern Water Authority, and now reside with the Environment Agency.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, these battle honours were {{entrusted}} to the 17th/18th Battalion (North Shore Regiment), {{which had been}} formed in 1948, when Australia's part-time military force was re-raised {{under the guise of}} the Citizens Military Force.

5|$|In later life, he {{attempted}} to have Anna Maria Luisa recognised as the universal heiress of Tuscany, but CharlesVI, Holy Roman Emperor, would not allow it because Florence was nominally an imperial fief, and he felt he alone could alter the Tuscan laws of succession.

5|$|Israeli {{historian}} David Tal {{agreed with}} this view; Yoav Gelber, {{when asked about}} this, commented that {{the significance of the}} attack, along with two other major tactical failures—Latrun and Jenin—was {{in the fact that the}} initiative <b>passed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Israeli side, and the Arabs conducted only small assaults after these operations. Scholar Fawaz Gerges noted that the Egyptians originally assumed that the further their army advances, the weaker the Israeli resistance would become.|$|E
