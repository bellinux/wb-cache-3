25|$|The <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> is {{understood}} as the linear electromechanical interaction between the mechanical and the electrical state in crystalline materials with no inversion symmetry. The <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> is a reversible process in that materials exhibiting the direct <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> (the internal generation of electrical charge resulting from an applied mechanical force) also exhibit the reverse <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> (the internal generation of a mechanical strain resulting from an applied electrical field). For example, lead zirconate titanate crystals will generate measurable piezoelectricity when their static structure is deformed by about 0.1% of the original dimension. Conversely, those same crystals will change about 0.1% of their static dimension when an external electric field {{is applied to the}} material. The inverse <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> is used in the production of ultrasonic sound waves.|$|E
25|$|The <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> {{converts}} {{mechanical strain}} into electric current or voltage. This strain {{can come from}} many different sources. Human motion, low-frequency seismic vibrations, and acoustic noise are everyday examples. Except in rare instances the <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> operates in AC requiring time-varying inputs at mechanical resonance to be efficient.|$|E
25|$|Piezoelectric {{materials}} {{also show}} the opposite effect, called the converse <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effect,</b> where {{the application of}} an electrical field creates mechanical deformation in the crystal.|$|E

25|$|The Curies, however, did {{not predict}} the {{converse}} <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effect.</b> The converse effect was mathematically deduced from fundamental thermodynamic principles by Gabriel Lippmann in 1881. The Curies immediately confirmed {{the existence of}} the converse effect, and went on to obtain quantitative proof of the complete reversibility of electro-elasto-mechanical deformations in piezoelectric crystals.|$|E

30|$|The {{objective}} of the present paper is to investigate the combined surface and <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effects</b> on the buckling of piezoelectric nanowires using the modified Timoshenko beam model. In this study, the two modified Euler beam and Timoshenko beam models have been compared, but no quantitative experimental measurement has been reported on the buckling condition of piezoelectric nanowires. A numerical example {{is presented in the}} article to demonstrate both the surface and <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effects,</b> and then, some discussions are provided based on the obtained results.|$|R
25|$|All class 2 ceramic {{capacitors}} using ferroelectric ceramics exhibit piezoelectricity, {{and have}} a <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> called microphonics, microphony or in audio applications squealing. Microphony describes the phenomenon wherein electronic components transform mechanical vibrations into an electrical signal which in many cases is undesired noise. Sensitive electronic preamplifiers generally use class 1 capacitors to avoid this effect.|$|E
25|$|The first {{demonstration}} of the direct <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> was in 1880 by the brothers Pierre Curie and Jacques Curie. They combined their knowledge of pyroelectricity with {{their understanding of the}} underlying crystal structures that gave rise to pyroelectricity to predict crystal behavior, and demonstrated the effect using crystals of tourmaline, quartz, topaz, cane sugar, and Rochelle salt (sodium potassium tartrate tetrahydrate). Quartz and Rochelle salt exhibited the most piezoelectricity.|$|E
25|$|A {{piezoelectric}} transformer {{is a type}} of AC voltage multiplier. Unlike {{a conventional}} transformer, which uses magnetic coupling between input and output, the piezoelectric transformer uses acoustic coupling. An input voltage is applied across a short length of a bar of piezoceramic material such as PZT, creating an alternating stress in the bar by the inverse <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> and causing the whole bar to vibrate. The vibration frequency is chosen to be the resonant frequency of the block, typically in the 100kilohertz to 1megahertz range. A higher output voltage is then generated across another section of the bar by the <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effect.</b> Step-up ratios of more than 1,000:1 have been demonstrated. An extra feature of this transformer is that, by operating it above its resonant frequency, it can be made to appear as an inductive load, which is useful in circuits that require a controlled soft start. These devices can be used in DC–AC inverters to drive cold cathode fluorescent lamps. Piezo transformers {{are some of the most}} compact high voltage sources.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to present active {{vibration}} control of stiffened plates. A stiffened plate finite element with <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effects</b> is formulated. The characteristic feature of the stiffener {{is that it can}} have any shape in plan and need not pass through the nodal lines of the finite element mesh. The coupling between the direct and the converse <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effects</b> is neglected for simplicity. A velocity feedback algorithm is employed in the active control. Numerical examples for vibration control of isotropic and orthotropic stiffened plates have been presented. © Elsevie...|$|R
30|$|To {{ensure the}} quality of wooden materials, {{nondestructive}} evaluation techniques need to be developed. In particular, the detection of local defects such as cracks, knots, and pith is of great importance for ensuring structural integrity. Wood has been known as a piezoelectric material {{since the middle of}} the 20 th century, when Fukada succeeded in experimentally verifying the direct and converse <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effects</b> of wood [1]. Using <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effects,</b> the mechanical behaviors of wood were investigated; the piezoelectric signals were related to the profiles of defects [2 – 4] and to the deformation [5, 6] and stress–strain relation [7, 8].|$|R
50|$|Since 2006, {{there have}} also been a number of reports of strong non linear <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effects</b> in polar semiconductors.Such effects are {{generally}} recognized to be at least important if not of the same order of magnitude as the first order approximation.|$|R
25|$|The <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> is {{generally}} thought {{to act as}} a biological force sensor. This effect was exploited by research conducted at the University of Pennsylvania in the late 1970s and early 1980s, which established that sustained application of electrical potential could stimulate both resorption and growth (depending on the polarity) of bone in-vivo. Further studies in the 1990s provided the mathematical equation to confirm long bone wave propagation as to that of hexagonal (Class 6) crystals.|$|E
25|$|The {{pyroelectric effect}} {{converts}} a temperature change into electric current or voltage. It {{is analogous to}} the <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effect,</b> which is another type of ferroelectric behavior. Pyroelectricity requires time-varying inputs and suffers from small power outputs in energy harvesting applications due to its low operating frequencies. However, one key advantage of pyroelectrics over thermoelectrics is that many pyroelectric materials are stable up to 1200 ⁰C or higher, enabling energy harvesting from high temperature sources and thus increasing thermodynamic efficiency.|$|E
25|$|A {{piezoelectric}} motor or piezo motor {{is a type}} {{of electric}} motor based upon the change in shape of a piezoelectric material when an electric field is applied. Piezoelectric motors make use of the converse <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> whereby the material produces acoustic or ultrasonic vibrations in order to produce a linear or rotary motion. In one mechanism, the elongation in a single plane is used to make a series stretches and position holds, similar to the way a caterpillar moves.|$|E

Zero photoluminescence excitation (PLE) absorption intensities are observed at low temperatures. Excitation power density-dependent optical properties {{provide evidence that}} the zero PLE absorption intensities are due to an internal electric field created by tiny strain-induced piezoelectric polarization along the wires, which causes complete spatial separation of the electron and hole wave functions along the wires. Absorption is enhanced by shining a He–Ne laser as a background in order to screen the electric field, which confirms the existence of <b>piezoelectric</b> field <b>effects...</b>|$|R

25|$|All {{ferroelectric}} materials exhibit piezoelectricity a <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effect.</b> Because Class 2 ceramic capacitors use ferroelectric ceramics dielectric, {{these types}} of capacitors may have electrical effects called microphonics. Microphonics (microphony) describes how electronic components transform mechanical vibrations into an undesired electrical signal (noise). The dielectric may absorb mechanical forces from shock or vibration by changing thickness and changing the electrode separation, affecting the capacitance, which in turn induces an AC current. The resulting interference is especially problematic in audio applications, potentially causing feedback or unintended recording.|$|E
25|$|The {{efficiency}} of a hybrid photovoltaic cell that contains piezoelectric materials {{can be increased}} simply by placing it near a source of ambient noise or vibration. The effect was demonstrated with organic cells using zinc oxide nanotubes. The electricity generated by the <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> itself is a negligible percentage of the overall output. Sound levels as low as 75 decibels improved efficiency by up to 50%. Efficiency peaked at 10kHz, the resonant frequency of the nanotubes. The electrical field {{set up by the}} vibrating nanotubes interacts with electrons migrating from the organic polymer layer. This process decreases the likelihood of recombination, in which electrons are energized but settle back into a hole instead of migrating to the electron-accepting ZnO layer.|$|E
25|$|Crystals {{can have}} certain special electrical, optical, and {{mechanical}} properties that glass and polycrystals normally cannot. These properties {{are related to}} the anisotropy of the crystal, i.e. the lack of rotational symmetry in its atomic arrangement. One such property is the <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effect,</b> where a voltage across the crystal can shrink or stretch it. Another is birefringence, where a double image appears when looking through a crystal. Moreover, various properties of a crystal, including electrical conductivity, electrical permittivity, and Young's modulus, may be different in different directions in a crystal. For example, graphite crystals consist of a stack of sheets, and although each individual sheet is mechanically very strong, the sheets are rather loosely bound to each other. Therefore, the mechanical strength of the material is quite different depending on the direction of stress.|$|E
40|$|We predict {{enormous}} <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effects</b> in intrinsic monolayer group IV monochalcogenides (MX, M=Sn or Ge, X=Se or S), including SnSe, SnS, GeSe and GeS. Using first-principle simulations {{based on}} the modern theory of polarization, we find that their characteristic piezoelectric coefficients are about two orders of magnitude larger than those of other 2 D materials, such as MoS 2 and GaSe, and bulk quartz and AlN which are widely used in industry. This enhancement {{is a result of}} the unique "puckered" C 2 v symmetry and weaker chemical bonds of monolayer group IV monochalcogenides. Given the achieved experimental advances in fabrication of monolayers, their flexible character and ability to withstand enormous strain, these 2 D structures with giant <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effects</b> may be promising for a broad range of applications, such as nano-sized sensors, piezotronics, and energy harvesting in portable electronic devices...|$|R

For all shapes, the matrix element initially increases with increasing dot height, as the electron and hole wave functions become more localized in k space.

25|$|Of decisive {{importance}} for the <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> is the change of polarization P when applying a mechanical stress. This might either {{be caused by a}} reconfiguration of the dipole-inducing surrounding or by re-orientation of molecular dipole moments {{under the influence of the}} external stress. Piezoelectricity may then manifest in a variation of the polarization strength, its direction or both, with the details depending on: 1. the orientation of P within the crystal; 2. crystal symmetry; and 3. the applied mechanical stress. The change in P appears as a variation of surface charge density upon the crystal faces, i.e. as a variation of the electric field extending between the faces caused by a change in dipole density in the bulk. For example, a 1cm3 cube of quartz with 2kN (500lbf) of correctly applied force can produce a voltage of 12500 V.|$|E
