40|$|SummaryJaw <b>protrusion</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} innovations in vertebrate feeding over the last 400 million years [1, 2]. <b>Protrusion</b> enables a fish to rapidly decrease the distance between itself and its prey [2, 3]. We assessed the evolution and functional implications of jaw <b>protrusion</b> in teleost fish assemblages from shallow coastal seas since the Cretaceous. By examining extant teleost fishes, we identified a robust morphological predictor of jaw <b>protrusion</b> that enabled us to predict the extent of jaw <b>protrusion</b> in fossil fishes. Our analyses revealed increases in both average and maximum jaw <b>protrusion</b> over the last 100 million years, with a progressive increase in the potential impact of fish predation on elusive prey. Over this period, the increase in jaw <b>protrusion</b> was initially driven by a taxonomic restructuring of fish assemblages, with an increase in the proportion of spiny-rayed fishes (Acanthomorpha), followed by an increase in the extent of <b>protrusion</b> within this clade.

5|$|Razer's four-wheeled {{drive train}} used a skid-steering arrangement, whereby the wheels {{on one side}} of the robot rotated faster than those on the other to turn the machine. Also, the weight of the robot was biased towards the rear so that its weapon stayed facing its {{opponent}} as Razer turned. However, the solid rubber rear wheels used in series two provided too much traction and were reluctant to 'swing' the machine. For the third series, Razer used custom-made aluminium drive wheels which incorporated rollers, reducing the amount of force required for simultaneous forward and sideways movement. These wheels were later upgraded with a stronger titanium construction, whilst the level of oversteer in the drive system was reduced through the implementation of an electronic gyroscope. For the series Robot Wars Extreme II, Razer's rubber front wheels were replaced with metal ones bearing small spiked <b>protrusions.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sculpturing is seen {{on many of}} {{the skull}} bones, in the form of long grooves, pits and <b>protrusions.</b> Like other ceratosaurs, the frontal bones of the skull roof were fused together.

Carnotaurus had two pronounced horns, projecting outward above the eyes, while its close relative Aucasaurus had smaller projections in the same area. Majungasaurus and Rajasaurus had a single bony horn or dome, projecting upwards from the skull. These projections, like the horns of many modern animals, might have been displayed for species recognition or intimidation. In Arcovenator, the dorsal margin of the postorbital (and probably also the lacrimal) is thickened dorsolaterally, forming a strong and rugose bony brow ridge rising above the level of the skull roof.

40|$|Possible neural {{correlates}} of somatosensory modulation of tinnitus were assessed. Functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) was used to investigate differences in neural activity between subjects that can modulate their tinnitus by jaw <b>protrusion</b> and normal hearing controls. We measured responses to bilateral sound and responses to jaw <b>protrusion.</b> Additionally we studied multimodal integration of somatosensory jaw <b>protrusion</b> and sound. The auditory system responded to both sound and jaw <b>protrusion.</b> Jaw responses were enhanced in the cochlear nucleus (CN) and the inferior colliculus (IC) in tinnitus patients. The responses of the auditory brain areas to jaw <b>protrusion</b> presumable account for the modulation of tinnitus as described by the patients. The somatosensory system responded to jaw <b>protrusion</b> and not to sound. These responses occurred both in subjects with tinnitus and controls. Unexpectedly, the cerebellum responded to sound in normal hearing subjects, but not in tinnitus patients. Together, these results provide a neurophysiological basis for the effect of jaw <b>protrusion</b> on tinnitus. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|<b>Protrusion</b> of {{scaffold}} struts {{is related}} with local coronary flow dynamics that can promote scaffold restenosis and thrombosis. That fact has prompted us to investigate in vivo the <b>protrusion</b> status {{of different types}} of scaffolds and their relationship with endothelial shear stress (ESS) distributions. Six Absorb everolimus-eluting Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffolds (Absorb, Abbott Vascular) and 11 Mirage sirolimus-eluting Bioresorbable Microfiber Scaffolds (Mirage, Manli Cardiology) were implanted in coronaries of eight mini pigs. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed post-scaffold implantation and obtained images were fused with angiographic data to reconstruct the three dimensional coronary anatomy. Blood flow simulation was performed and ESS distribution was estimated for each scaffold. <b>Protrusion</b> distance was estimated using a dedicated software. Correlation between OCT-derived <b>protrusion</b> and ESS distribution was assessed for both scaffold groups. A significant difference was observed in the <b>protrusion</b> distances (156 +/- 137 A mu m for Absorb, 139 +/- 153 A mu m for Mirage; p = 0. 035), whereas difference remained after adjusting the <b>protrusion</b> distances according to the luminal areas. Strut <b>protrusion</b> of Absorb is inversely correlated with ESS (r = - 0. 369, p < 0. 0001), whereas in Mirage <b>protrusion</b> was positively correlated with EES (r = 0. 192, p < 0. 0001). <b>Protrusion</b> distance was higher in Absorb than in Mirage. The <b>protrusion</b> of the thick quadratic struts of Absorb has a tendency to lower shear stress in the close vicinity of struts. However, circular shape of the less thick struts of Mirage didn't show this trend in creating zone of recirculation around the struts.

5|$|The {{secretions}} {{from the}} parasite give the Nemesis massively heightened regenerative abilities, which {{result in the}} creature being almost impervious to damage; although it can be put down with enough fire from small arms, eventually it will repair itself and resume the pursuit of its targets.

5|$|Central to this discussion, it was {{announced}} in 2009, that the radius of Betelgeuse had shrunk from 1993 to 2009 by 15%, with the 2008 angular measurement equal to 47.0mas, {{not too far from}} Perrin's estimate. Unlike most earlier papers, this study encompassed a 15-year period at one specific wavelength. Earlier studies have typically lasted one to two years by comparison and have explored multiple wavelengths, often yielding vastly different results. The diminution in Betelgeuse's apparent size equates to a range of values between 56.0±0.1mas seen in 1993 to 47.0±0.1mas seen in 2008—a contraction of almost 0.9AU in 15years. What is not fully known is whether this observation is evidence of a rhythmic expansion and contraction of the star's photosphere as astronomers have theorized, and if so, what the periodic cycle might be, although Townes suggested that if a cycle does exist, it is probably a few decades long. Other possible explanations are photospheric <b>protrusions</b> due to convection or a star that is not spherical but asymmetric causing the appearance of expansion and contraction as the star rotates on its axis.|$|E

Materials and Methods: In this study, 1303 subjects of healthy population (15 - 75 years old) in Bushehr were randomly selected from eccompannies persons of patients that referred to our endocrine clinic. Subjects with previous history of orbital surgery, eye trauma, strabismus, myopia (>- 2 Diopter), orbital inflammatory disease, skull and face abnormality were excluded. Extent of eye <b>protrusion</b> was measured by one endocrinologist using Hertel exophthalmometry. Results: The mean <b>protrusion</b> values for right eye and left eye were 17. 9 ± 11. 55 and 18. 08 ± 1. 5 mm, respectively. The exophthalmometric measurements were lower in right eye than left eye (p< 0. 0001). Also the mean eye <b>protrusion</b> decreased with increasing in age (p< 0. 0001).

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{framework}} for tracking arbitrary complex cell boundary movements, relying on a unique definition of <b>protrusion</b> and retraction as the pathlength a virtual edge marker traverses when moving continuously perpendicular to the cell boundary. We introduce the level set method as a numerical scheme to reconstruct continuous boundary movement in time-lapse image sequences with finite time sampling. For moderately complex movements, we describe a numerically less expensive method that satisfactorily approximates the definition. Densely sampled <b>protrusion</b> and retraction rates were accumulated in space-time charts revealing distinct morphodynamic states. Applying this technique to the profiling of epithelial cell <b>protrusion</b> we identified three different states. In the I-state, long cell edge sectors are synchronized in cycles of <b>protrusion</b> and retraction. In the V-state random bursts of <b>protrusion</b> initiate <b>protrusion</b> waves propagating transversally in both directions. Cells switch between both states dependent on the Rac 1 activation level. Furthermore, the persistence of transversal waves in the V-state depends on Arp 2 / 3 concentration. Inhibition of PAK shifts cells into a λ-state where continuous <b>protrusion</b> is occasionally interrupted by self-propagating ruffles. Our data support a model where activation of Rac 1 mediates the propagation of <b>protrusion</b> waves, whose persistence depends on the relative abundance of activated Arp 2 / 3 and polymerizable G-actin...|$|R
5|$|Excepting some domesticated forms, {{all male}} bovids have horns, {{and in many}} species, females, too, possess horns. The {{size and shape of}} the horns vary greatly, but the basic {{structure}} is a pair of simple bony <b>protrusions</b> without branches, often having a spiral, twisted, or fluted form, each covered in a permanent sheath of keratin. Although horns occur in a single pair on almost all bovid species, there are exceptions such as the four-horned antelope and the Jacob sheep. The unique horn structure is the only unambiguous morphological feature of bovids that distinguishes them from other pecorans. A high correlation exists between horn morphology and fighting behaviour of the individual. For instance, long horns are intended for wrestling and fencing, whereas curved horns are used in ramming. Males with horns directed inwards are monogamous and solitary, while those with horns directed outwards tend to be polygynous. These results were independent of body size.|$|E

5|$|Metazoans are {{multicellular}} organism, {{different groups}} of cells of which have separate functions. The most basic types of metazoan tissues are epithelium and connective tissue, {{both of which are}} present in nearly all invertebrates. The outer surface of the epidermis is normally formed of epithelial cells and secretes an extracellular matrix which provides support to the organism. An endoskeleton derived from the mesoderm is present in echinoderms, sponges and some cephalopods. Exoskeletons are derived from the epidermis and is composed of chitin in arthropods (insects, spiders, ticks, shrimps, crabs, lobsters). Calcium carbonate constitutes the shells of molluscs, brachiopods and some tube-building polychaete worms and silica forms the exoskeleton of the microscopic diatoms and radiolaria. Other invertebrates may have no rigid structures but the epidermis may secrete a variety of surface coatings such as the pinacoderm of sponges, the gelatinous cuticle of cnidarians (polyps, sea anemones, jellyfish) and the collagenous cuticle of annelids. The outer epithelial layer may include cells of several types including sensory cells, gland cells and stinging cells. There may also be <b>protrusions</b> such as microvilli, cilia, bristles, spines and tubercles.|$|E

5|$|In most bouts, the retiarius {{probably}} had {{to resort to}} fighting with just his trident and dagger, placing him at a disadvantage. The trident was his primary weapon in such situations, and its length allowed the retiarius to keep his opponent at bay. He held the weapon two-handed, left nearer the prongs, so that he could parry his enemy's strikes with its shaft and strike with both ends. Wielded two-handed, the weapon could land powerful blows. Images show retiarii stabbing downward at the secutors unshielded legs or stabbing down at the helmet in an attempt to poke through an eyehole. The trident itself was too weak to pierce the metal, although a skull found at Ephesus, Turkey, dating to CE200 to 300 shows that a trident strike to the head could be fatal on a bareheaded opponent. The secutors helmet was rounded and free of <b>protrusions</b> to avoid snaring the net or being caught in the trident's prongs, but attacks on it forced the secutor to duck or hide behind his shield. This reduced his field of vision and gave the retiarius an advantage with his speed. Should the secutor strike with his sword, the retiarius parried with the trident prongs and attempted to disarm him. Likewise, the more heavily armoured gladiator tried to block the trident with his shield and force the net-man to lose it. Another type of gladiator, scissor could also be pitted against a retiarius. Images from the Eastern Roman Empire show scissores wearing a tubular arm-guard in lieu of a shield. The guard fits over the left hand and ends in a hooked, knife-like blade that was probably intended to parry the net and trident or to snag and pull away the net. Scissores who succeeded in this probably dropped the hook weapon and fought with just a sword.|$|E
40|$|Integrin-mediated {{adhesion}} is {{a critical}} regulator of cell migration. Here we demonstrate that integrin-mediated adhesion to high fibronectin concentrations induces a stop signal for cell migration by inhibiting cell polarization and <b>protrusion.</b> On fibronectin, the stop signal is generated through � 5 � 1 integrin-mediated signaling to the Rho family of GTPases. Specifically, Cdc 42 and Rac 1 activation exhibits a biphasic dependence on fibronectin concentration that parallels optimum cell polarization and <b>protrusion.</b> In contrast, RhoA activity increases with increasing substratum concentration. We find that cross talk between Cdc 42 and Rac 1 is required for substratum-stimulated <b>protrusion,</b> whereas RhoA activity is inhibitory. We also show that Cdc 42 activity is inhibited by Rac 1 activation, suggesting that Rac 1 activity may down-regulate Cdc 42 activity and promote the formation of stabilized rather than transient <b>protrusion.</b> Furthermore, expression of RhoA down-regulates Cdc 42 and Rac 1 activity, providing a mechanism whereby RhoA may inhibit cell polarization and <b>protrusion.</b> These findings implicate adhesion-dependent signaling as a mechanism to stop cell migration by regulating cell polarity and <b>protrusion</b> via the Rho family of GTPases...|$|R

The results {{of the present study}} further indicated that THS with 2 / 3 rd and maximal <b>protrusion</b> induced significantly higher suprahyoid muscle activation as compared to THS with 1 / 3 rd <b>protrusion.</b> In addition, the increase in peak suprahyoid muscle activation during THS with maximal <b>protrusion</b> was found to be significantly higher as compared to that during THS with 2 / 3 rd <b>protrusion</b> (Fig.  1). These results suggest that the greater the <b>protrusion</b> of the tongue, the greater the suprahyoid muscle activation during swallowing.|$|R
