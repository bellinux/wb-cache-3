50|$|Some {{machines}} now use {{a direct}} drive motor, a low aspect ratio device, where the stator assembly {{is attached to}} the rear of the outer drum, whilst the co-axial rotor is mounted on the shaft of the inner drum. Direct drive eliminates the need for a <b>pulley,</b> <b>belt</b> and belt tensioner.|$|E
5000|$|Ignition was via a magneto, and {{the engine}} was started using bicycle-style pedals. Instead of a {{conventional}} clutch, a <b>pulley</b> <b>belt</b> tensioner could be moved, allowing the leather drive belt to slip. [...] Touting its effective muffler, Harley-Davidson advertised the 7D, and the other Harleys of this era, as [...] "The Silent Gray Fellow." [...] The latter moniker was also in reference to William S. Harley, who {{was known for his}} quiet personality. A 1911 Model 7D from the George Pardo collection was set to be auctioned in January 2014.|$|E

40|$|During {{design of}} the {{envelope}} of a noncircular <b>belt</b> <b>pulley</b> one should take into account several conditions resulting from kinematics and geometry of the uneven-running strand transmission. Design of proper values of pitches for a <b>belt</b> <b>pulley,</b> which enable good cooperation between the <b>belt</b> <b>pulley</b> and the <b>belt,</b> should be carefully done. In available Polish literature and catalogues offered by belt manufacturers, one can find only detailed dimensions of belts with a trapezoidal profile. Information on other profiles is insufficient for full description of geometrical features of <b>belt</b> <b>pulley</b> teeth {{as well as to}} design tools for machining <b>belt</b> <b>pulleys.</b> Manufacturers of <b>belt</b> <b>pulleys</b> and <b>belts</b> give only necessary data to submit a purchase order. The paper presents a digitization process (scanning) of geometry of the envelope of circular <b>belt</b> <b>pulleys</b> with non-standard profiles; this scanning has been done with the application of coordinate measuring machines. The obtained information on geometrical features of tooth profiles has been numerically analysed. As a result of this analysis, the mathematical description has been obtained. Finally, noncircular <b>belt</b> <b>pulleys</b> with different tooth profiles have been designed and manufactured...|$|R
5000|$|Belting leather is a {{full-grain leather}} {{originally}} used in driving <b>pulley</b> <b>belts</b> and other machinery. It is {{found on the}} surface of briefcases, portfolios, and wallets, and can be identified by its thick, firm feel and smooth finish. Belting leather is generally a heavy-weight of full-grain, vegetable-tanned leather.|$|R
50|$|Front-loading washers are {{mechanically}} simple {{compared to}} top-loaders, {{with the main}} motor (a universal motor or variable-frequency drive motor) normally being connected to the drum via a grooved <b>pulley</b> <b>belt</b> and large pulley wheel, {{without the need for}} a gearbox, clutch or crank. But front-load washers suffer from their own technical problems, due to the drum lying sideways. For example, a top loading washer keeps water inside the tub merely through the force of gravity pulling down on the water, while a front-loader must tightly seal the door shut with a gasket to prevent water dripping onto the floor during the wash cycle. This access door is locked shut during the entire wash cycle, since opening the door with the machine in use could result in water gushing out onto the floor. For front-loaders without viewing windows on the door, it is possible to accidentally pinch fabric between the door and the drum, resulting in tearing and damage to the pinched clothing during tumbling and spinning.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a design optimization process for interior permanent magnet synchronous motors (IPMSM) for hybrid electric compressors (HEC) which {{are applied to}} hybrid electrical vehicles. A hybrid electric compressor is composed of an electric motor driving section and an engine driving section which {{is connected to the}} engine by a <b>pulley</b> <b>belt.</b> A hybrid electric compressor driving motor requires half of the full driving power of a compressor. Even though an engine is not operated at the idling stop mode, the electric motor drives the air-conditioner compressor by itself so that the air conditioning system can produce its minimum cooling capacity. In this paper, the design optimization of an IPMSM for a 42 (V) applied voltage system is studied using the design of experiment (DOE) and response surface method (RSM) of 6 sigma. The driving characteristics of this motor drive system are measured and analyzed by experiment...|$|E
40|$|The {{squeezing}} {{process of}} grated coconut into coconut milk, {{and the following}} process of making the milk into coconut oil, which is done by people living in rural areas, is until now still very traditional. They do it manually (by hands) so that they produce 7. 2 kg/hour grated coconut or 3. 6 litres/hour thick coconut milk. To effectify the process, the squeezing needs to be mechanized, using a grated coconut squeezer machine. The machine is designed {{on the basis of}} Screw Press system with a ¼ HP 1450 rpm electric motor power using a <b>pulley</b> <b>belt</b> transmission and a gear box. The squeezer 2 ̆ 7 s force refers to coconuts aging between 341 and 413 days (hand squeezing force normally practised by coconut oil producers in rural areas). This prototype of machine has the capacity of producing 53. 2 kg/hour grated coconut or 26. 6 litres/hour thick coconut milk, which has similar quality (in colour, smell and texture) as that manually squeezed...|$|E

40|$|Composite {{material}} {{could be}} developed into new material that would be useful for many interests. Fiber as composite raw material must be given pretreatment {{to improve the quality}} of composite. In this research, raw material for the composite was umbrella grass (Cyperus Alternifolius). A tool was designed to facilitate the processes of rolling or pressing, or abbreviated as roll press. Indeed, the design of roll press was preceded by designing the construction section that involved shaft, transmission system, bearing, <b>pulley</b> <b>belt,</b> and driver motor to move the roll. Result of rolling must be suitable for processing umbrella grass into the fiber of composite raw material. Testing was conduced to examine the work of the tool against the stalk of umbrella grass. Two testing was considered. First was testing against the variation of loads, which involved 10 kg, 12 kg and 14 kg. Second test was against the variation of roll rotation at 160 rpm, 197 rpm and 280 rpm. Result of both tests provided specific fiber derived from umbrella grass that would be compatible to be composite material. Some results of research were indicated. Main drive motor was ½ PK with rotation (n 1) = 1430 rpm. Pulley diameter (d 1) was 75 mm. Reducer system was signified by n 2 = 831 rpm and d 2 = 129 mm, and if d 3 = 59 mm was used, the outcome was n 4 = 160 rpm with d 4 = 307 mm. In case of bearing, its sliding moment was 0. 309 N. mm and tangent force was 2. 06 N. The frame of roll press tool was designed at the dimension of length x wide x height = 600 mm x 320 mm x 1200 mm. The best parameter was 160 rpm with load force of 10 kg. By taking account all these results, it could be said that the result of roll press processing had successfully produced the fiber from umbrella grass into the suitable raw material for the composite...|$|E

50|$|Power {{transmission}} {{is a function}} of belt tension. However, also increasing with tension is stress (load) on the belt and bearings. The ideal belt is that of the lowest tension that does not slip in high loads. Belt tensions should also be adjusted to belt type, size, speed, and <b>pulley</b> diameters. <b>Belt</b> tension is determined by measuring the force to deflect the belt a given distance per inch of <b>pulley.</b> Timing <b>belts</b> need only adequate tension to keep the belt in contact with the pulley.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of noise and {{friction}} on performance of the chain drive system for motor bikes. Experiment shows that chain transmission in chain drive system leads to poor overall performance, due to its noise and chain gets loose due to aging and sprockets wear due to chain friction etc., the proposed system consists of drive and driven <b>pulley</b> with timing <b>belt</b> transmission. Compared to conventional method, proposed method give improved tension in <b>pulleys</b> and <b>belt</b> by the additional arrangement called belt tensioner. This gives good overall performance of the system, and reduces noise, vibration and gives high transmission speed...|$|R
50|$|Fatigue, {{more so than}} abrasion, is {{the culprit}} for most belt problems. This wear is caused by stress from rolling around the <b>pulleys.</b> High <b>belt</b> tension; {{excessive}} slippage; adverse environmental conditions; and belt overloads caused by shock, vibration, or belt slapping all contribute to belt fatigue.|$|R
