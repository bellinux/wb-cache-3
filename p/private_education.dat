40|$|In Mexico, {{official}} mechanisms regulating <b>private</b> higher <b>education</b> {{are very}} flexible, thus, {{there is a}} wide variety of <b>private</b> higher <b>education</b> institutions: On the one hand, there are institutions that meet the requisites to provide professional training, on the other hand, there are institutions that barely meet the necessary requirements. This has caused an uneven academic quality among <b>private</b> higher <b>education</b> institutions. This quality is certified (on a voluntary basis, i. e. not legally binding) by three agencies. This article analyzes the procedures of the three agencies that are responsible for assessing and certifying the quality of <b>private</b> higher <b>education</b> institutions.

5|$|The Bambers were financially secure. There was the farmhouse, {{property}} in London, 300 {{acres of land}} and a caravan site. Their company, N. and J. Bamber Ltd, was worth ₤400,000 (c.£1,057,000). In her will June left ₤230,000 (c.£608,000 in 2016), and Nevill left ₤380,000 (c.£1,004,000); Bamber was a major beneficiary of both wills.

5|$|Women {{had limited}} access to formal {{education}} and girls benefited less than boys from {{the expansion of the}} parish school system. Some women were taught reading, domestic tasks, but often not writing. In noble households some received a <b>private</b> <b>education</b> and some female literary figures emerged from the seventeenth century. Religion may have been particularly important as a means of expression for women and from the seventeenth century women may have had greater opportunities for religious participation in movements outside of the established kirk. Women had very little legal status {{at the beginning of the}} period, unable to act as witnesses or legally responsible for their own actions. From the mid-sixteenth century they were increasingly criminalised, with statutes allowing them to be prosecuted for infanticide and as witches. Seventy-five per cent of an estimated 6,000 individuals prosecuted for witchcraft between 1563 and 1736 were women and perhaps 1,500 were executed. As a result, some historians have seen this period as characterised by increasing concern with women and attempts to control and constrain them.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Business Management)) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2007. The {{changing}} {{higher education}} environment {{has created a}} sense of urgency within <b>private</b> higher <b>education</b> institutions to change or else to perish. The latest legislation by the government compelling <b>private</b> higher <b>education</b> institutions to register with the Department of Education, coupled with the creation of mega-public higher education institutions by mergers, has made it imperative for private institutions to re-examine their financial management systems, cost management systems and decision-making systems. <b>Private</b> higher <b>education</b> institutions do not receive any funding from government, unlike their public counter-parts. They depend totally on private funds from student fees, investors and donors. In order to compete with the State subsidized public institutions, private institutions must minimize costs and maximize profits. This means that the cost of their courses must be comparable to those of public institutions, {{while at the same time}} offering quality teaching and learning. This study examines the cost management system, the financial management system and the decision-making system of <b>private</b> higher <b>education</b> institutions. The research is supported by a detailed literary study of these issues within the higher education sector, as well as an empirical study of cost management in <b>private</b> higher <b>education</b> institutions in South Africa.
