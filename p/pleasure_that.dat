5|$|Midway {{through the}} poem, {{there is a}} split between the two actions of the poem: the first {{attempts}} {{to identify with the}} nightingale and its song, and the second discusses the convergence of the past with the future while experiencing the present. This second theme is reminiscent of Keats's view of human progression through the Mansion of Many Apartments and how man develops from experiencing and wanting only pleasure to understanding truth as a mixture of both pleasure and pain. The Elysian fields and the nightingale's song {{in the first half of}} the poem represent the pleasurable moments that overwhelm the individual like a drug. However, the experience does not last forever, and the body is left desiring it until the narrator feels helpless without the pleasure. Instead of embracing the coming truth, the narrator clings to poetry to hide from the loss of pleasure. Poetry does not bring about the <b>pleasure</b> <b>that</b> the narrator original asks for, but it does liberate him from his desire for only pleasure.|$|E

5000|$|The 20th-century American {{psychological}} theorist David McClelland suggested worldly asceticism {{is specifically}} targeting worldly <b>pleasures</b> <b>that</b> [...] "distract" [...] {{people from their}} calling and may accept worldly <b>pleasures</b> <b>that</b> are not distracting. As an example, he pointed out Quakers have historically objected to bright-coloured clothing, but wealthy Quakers often made their drab clothing out of expensive materials. The color was considered distracting, but the materials were not. Amish groups use similar criteria {{to make decisions about}} which modern technologies to use and which to avoid.|$|R

25|$|Hence {{whatever}} suffering or <b>pleasure</b> <b>that</b> a soul may {{be experiencing}} now is {{on account of}} choices that it has made in past. That is why Jainism stresses pure thinking and moral behavior. Apart from Buddhism, perhaps Jainism is the only religion that does not invoke the fear of God {{as a reason for}} moral behavior.|$|E

25|$|The {{coat of arms}} of Buckinghamshire County Council {{features}} a white swan in chains. This {{dates back to the}} Anglo-Saxon period, when swans were bred in Buckinghamshire for the king's <b>pleasure.</b> <b>That</b> the swan is in chains illustrates that the swan is bound to the monarch, an ancient law that still applies to wild swans in the UK today. The arms were first borne at the Battle of Agincourt by the Duke of Buckingham.|$|E
25|$|After a {{slow start}} commercially, by August 1861 the {{directors}} of the company recorded their <b>pleasure</b> <b>that</b> large volumes of fish, potatoes and broccoli had been carried from West Cornwall. This had been transported to Truro by the West Cornwall Railway which had a line from Penzance to Truro; the West Cornwall company was a narrow gauge line, and all goods had to be transshipped into different wagons at Truro due to the break of gauge there.|$|E
25|$|On February 17, {{the leading}} Tory MPPs held a public meeting to {{protest against the}} measure. George Moffatt was elected {{chairman}} and various public men such as Allan MacNab, Prince, Gugy, Macdonald, Molson, Rose and others gave speeches. The meeting prepared a petition to the governor asking him to dissolve the parliament and call new elections, or to reserve the assent of the bill for the Queen's <b>pleasure,</b> <b>that</b> is to say, to defer the question to the UK Parliament. The press reported that Lafontaine was burned in effigy that night.|$|E

50|$|As {{with the}} other Hellenistic schools of philosophy, the Epicureans {{believed}} {{that the goal of}} human life is happiness. The Epicureans defined pleasure as the absence of pain (mental and physical), and hence pleasure can only increase until the point in which pain is absent. Beyond this, pleasure cannot increase further, and indeed one cannot rationally seek bodily pleasure beyond the state of aponia. For Epicurus, aponia was one of the static (katastematic) <b>pleasures,</b> <b>that</b> is, a <b>pleasure</b> one has when there is no want or pain to be removed. To achieve such a state, one has to experience kinetic <b>pleasures,</b> <b>that</b> is, a <b>pleasure</b> one has when want or pain is being removed.|$|R

He also used puzzle websites as reference. He did not design the puzzles himself, instead leaving the puzzle direction to other staff, while checking it multiple times.|$|E
500|$|In Hobart, Amundsen {{received}} congratulatory telegrams from, among others, former US President Theodore Roosevelt and King George V of the United Kingdom. The king expressed particular <b>pleasure</b> <b>that</b> Amundsen's {{first port}} of call on his return had been on soil of the British Empire. In Norway, which only six years earlier had become an independent country after 500 years of Danish and Swedish supremacy, the news was proclaimed in banner headlines, and the national flag was flown throughout the country. [...] All the expedition's participants received the Norwegian South Pole medal (Sydpolsmedaljen), established by King Haakon to commemorate the expedition. [...] However, Amundsen's biographer Roland Huntford refers to [...] "the chill underneath the cheers"; there remained a residue of unease over Amundsen's tactics. One Norwegian newspaper expressed relief that Amundsen had found a new route, and had not intruded on Scott's path from McMurdo Sound.|$|E
500|$|McGregor {{served as}} the first {{chairman}} of the League's Management Committee. One of the committee's main jobs was handling issues of discipline, but committee members were not barred from involvement in decisions involving their own clubs. In fact, the first disciplinary meeting saw fines issued to {{three of the four}} clubs with representatives on the committee. McGregor was re-elected unopposed in 1891. Earlier he had spoken of his <b>pleasure</b> <b>that</b> [...] "of the 132 matches in which the League clubs have taken part and in which about 300 players have taken the field, not a single fatal accident has to be recorded". A year later he oversaw the expansion of the Football League into two divisions when the rival Football Alliance was merged into the competition, but he relinquished his post later that year due to ill health, which caused him to miss meetings.|$|E

5000|$|A {{lust for}} <b>pleasures</b> <b>that</b> the spirit, without {{a body of}} its own, cannot {{experience}} may lead the spirit to obsess a living person in order to share his or her emotions, eventually leading the victim to do things so that the spirit can partake of the victim's feelings.|$|R
500|$|Early 20th-century biographer André Maurois {{argues that}} [...] "what Byron {{was capable of}} loving in another was {{a certain kind of}} innocence and youthfulness" [...] and that the {{relationship}} was one of Byron's [...] "protective passions". Likewise, G. Wilson Knight, in his 1953 biography of Byron, believes that Byron became protective over Giraud just as he did with all of the children he met during his travels. Giraud was special to Byron, and, according to Knight, [...] "it was probably of Nicolo that he was thinking when he wrote that Greece was 'the only place I was ever contented in. In Byron: A Biography, published in 1957, Marchand points out that Byron [...] "wished Hobhouse there to share the nonsensical gaiety" [...] of when Byron and Giraud were together, but changed his mind after remembering that Hobhouse's personality would not be conducive to entertainment. Their time together [...] "was a relaxed <b>pleasure</b> <b>that</b> [...] was to remember more fondly than most of the adventures of his travels".|$|E
500|$|The show's website {{released}} a motion comic {{based on the}} first issue of the original comic and voiced by Phil LaMarr. The site also posted a making-of documentary, and other behind-the-scenes videos and interviews. In the documentary, Kirkman as well as artist Charlie Adlard expressed <b>pleasure</b> <b>that</b> the show is faithful to the comic and remark on the similarities between the actors and the comic's original character drawings. Several scenes were screened July 23, 2010 as part of the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International. Hurd asserted that [...] " [...] really are doing six one-hour movies", and Darabont insisted that the series would closely reflect the development in the comics. [...] "The path is a very strong template. But we're going to take every interesting detour we feel like taking. As long as were staying on the path of what Robert has done, I don't see any reason not to. If they have patience we'll eventually catch up to what Robert is doing." ...|$|E
500|$|Monteux {{regularly}} introduced new compositions in Boston, often {{works by}} American, English and French composers. [...] He {{was proud of}} the number of novelties presented in his years at Boston, and expressed <b>pleasure</b> <b>that</b> his successors continued the practice. He was dismayed when it was announced that his contract would not be renewed after 1924. The official explanation was that the orchestra's policy had always been to appoint conductors for no more than five years. It is unclear whether that was genuinely the reason. One suggested possibility is that the conductor chosen to replace him, Serge Koussevitzky, was thought more charismatic, with greater box-office appeal. Another is that the primmer members of Boston society disapproved of Monteux's morals: he and his second wife had gradually drifted apart and by 1924 he was living with Doris Hodgkins, an American divorcée, and her two children. They were unable to marry until 1928, when Germaine Monteux finally agreed to a divorce.|$|E
