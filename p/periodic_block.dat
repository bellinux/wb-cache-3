40|$|Defect {{detection}} is a {{major concern}} in quality control of various products in industries. This paper presents two different machine-vision based methods for detecting defects on periodically patterned textures. In the first method, input defective image is split into several blocks of size same as the size of the periodic unit of the image and chi-square histogram distances of each <b>periodic</b> <b>block</b> with respect to itself and all other periodic blocks are calculated to get a dissimilarity matrix. This dissimilarity matrix is subjected to Ward's hierarchical clustering to automatically identify defective and defect-free blocks. The second method of defect detection is based on Universal Quality Index which is a measure of loss of correlation, luminance distortion and contrast distortion between any two signals. Quality indices of a <b>periodic</b> <b>block</b> with respect to itself and all other periodic blocks are calculated to get a similarity matrix containing quality indices. Specific variances of the periodic blocks are derived from the quality index matrix through orthogonal factor model based on eigen decomposition. These variances are subjected to Ward's hierarchical clustering to automatically identify defective and defect-free blocks.

We have obtained a general relationship for the double nonequilibrium capillary pressure which represents great interest for applications. Due to the nonlinear coupling and the nonlocality in time, the macroscopic model remains incompletely homogenized in general case. The completely homogenized model was obtained for two different regimes. The first case corresponds to a linearized flow in the blocks.

We have shown that, through the proposed modifications, the denoising performance is significantly improved compared to the original BM 3 D on all tested images. It also substantially outperforms common linear filters such as median-filtering and low-pass Wiener filtering. The major advances are {{the adoption of a}} Fourier-based periodic similarity search [20] within the non-local means setting to the BM 3 D algorithm, as well as the treatment of an issue regarding spatial block concentration, which only occurs in the new BM 3 D setting. Furthermore, we showed that the proposed filter with its uniform adaptive <b>periodic</b> <b>block</b> matching, specifically tailored to perfect crystal structures, is able to significantly enhance both visually and quantitatively the image quality of low-dose electron micrographs. Quantitative measures of interest to the material science community, namely atomic column detectability and position precision, are significantly improved by application of the new denoising algorithm, without the introduction of artifacts such as false-positive identification of atomic columns or shifts in the atomic column image positions beyond the sub-picometer level.|$|E

Wallace† A reduced order model for off-wall {{boundary conditions}} for turbulent flows is proposed. The model circumvents {{the need to}} resolve the buffer layer near the wall by providing conditions directly above it for the overlying flow. The effect of the buffer layer is modeled as a pattern of <b>periodic</b> <b>blocks</b> similar to the minimal unit of Jiménez & Moin (1991). The model is reduced to the imprint of such blocks on a plane at y + ≈ 100, at which Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed {{for the rest of}} the flow. The blocks are constructed from the transitional direct simulation of Sayadi et al. (2012). The block sizes are selected so that they are statistically representative of fully turbulent flow, and so that they contain the dominant structures at y + ≈ 100, as educed from direct mode decomposition.

Then, after performing one step along the primary search axis, non-local periodic search steps along both positive and negative directions of the secondary search axis are carried out only until the image boundary is reached. This process is repeated until the image boundary is also reached along the positive and negative direction of the primary search axis. On the one hand, this implementation requires less computational cost than computing the whole set of points within the image that could be reached by steps along either of the two periodicity axes, while on the other hand, it still gives a sufficiently large subset of all of these points. This efficient periodic block-matching strategy increases the computational cost by a factor of about 1.5 to 2 (depending on the density of the atoms within the image) compared to our implementation of BM 3 D with local block matching. Note that due to the overhead produced by unoptimized parts of our implementation this relative comparison may not be exact. Nevertheless, we believe that the factor between the run-times of local and <b>periodic</b> <b>block</b> matching would be of the same order of magnitude in optimized code as well.|$|E

Products of the 1980 - 1986 eruptions of Mount St. Helens have been analysed for (210 Pb/ 226 Ra). Both excesses and deficits of 210 Pb are encountered suggesting rapid gas transfer. The time scale of diffuse, non-eruptive gas escape prior to 1980 as documented by 210 Pb deficits is on the order of a decade using the model developed by Gauthier and Condomines (Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 172 (1999) 111 - 126) for a non-renewed magma chamber and efficient Rn removal. The time required to build-up 210 Pb excess is much shorter (months) as can be observed from steady increases of (210 Pb/ 226 Ra) with time during 1980 - 1982. The formation of 210 Pb excess requires both rapid gas transport through the magma and <b>periodic</b> <b>blocking</b> of gas escape routes. Superposed on this time trend is the natural variability of (210 Pb/ 226 Ra) in a single eruption caused by tapping magma from various depths. The two time scales of gas transport, to create both 210 Pb deficits and 210 Pb excesses, cannot be reconciled in a single event. Rather 210 Pb deficits are associated with pre-eruptive diffuse degassing, while 210 Pb excesses document the more vigorous degassing associated with eruption and recharge of the system. © 2006 Elsevier B.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} phase {{structure}} and the renormalization group (RG) flow of the generalized sine-Gordon models with nonvanishing mass terms, using the Wegner-Houghton RG method in the local potential approximation. Particular emphasis is laid upon the layered sine-Gordon (LSG) model, which is the bosonized version of the multi-flavour Schwinger model and approaches the sum of two ``normal'', massless sine-Gordon (SG) models {{in the limit of}} a vanishing interlayer coupling J. Another model of interest is the massive sine-Gordon (MSG) model. The leading-order approximation to the UV (ultra-violet) RG flow predicts two phases for the LSG {{as well as for the}} MSG, just as it would be expected for the SG model, where the two phases are known to be separated by the Coleman fixed point. The presence of finite mass terms (for the LSG and the MSG) leads to corrections to the UV RG flow, which are naturally identified as the ``mass corrections''. The leading-order mass corrections are shown to have the following consequences: (i) for the MSG model, only one phase persists, and (ii) for the LSG model, the transition temperature is modified. Within the mass-corrected UV scaling laws, the limit of J -> 0 is thus nonuniform with respect to the phase structure of the model. The modified phase structure of general massive sine-Gordon models is connected with the breaking of symmetries in the internal space spanned by the field variables. For the LSG, the second-order subleading mass corrections suggest that there exists a cross-over regime before the IR scaling sets in, and the nonlinear terms show explicitly that higher-order Fourier modes appear in the <b>periodic</b> <b>blocked</b> potential.
