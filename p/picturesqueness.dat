5|$|In 1907, Besant {{became the}} {{president}} of the Theosophical Society globally, and set to work with a major expansion of the organisation's headquarters at Adyar, in what was then, Madras. When it was announced that Besant would undertake a speaking tour of Australia in 1908, she was expected to stay with Fuller while in Perth. Some months later in 1908, Fuller left Western Australia and travelled to India, staying at Adyar. Of her time in India, Fuller wrote:I went in search not only of beauty, and light, and colour, and the <b>picturesqueness</b> in general, which delight the eye and emotions of all artists—but of something deeper—something less easily expressed. I spent {{two and a half years}} in a community that is quite unique—perhaps the most cosmopolitan settlement in the world—the headquarters of the Theosophical Society... Well, I painted there, of course, but my art was undergoing a change, and I felt that it could not satisfy me unless it became so much greater.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, Virginia Weddell hired {{architect}} William Lawrence Bottomley {{and purchased}} antique stone columns from the Spanish Duke of the Infantado to reconstruct an ancient Spanish loggia {{on the southwest}} elevation of the house. Bottomley was able to incorporate the existing parapets, finials and pierced railings and posts from the north library bay windows into the loggia design, with a ceiling reconstructed from a sixteenth-century house {{on the grounds of}} a manor in Knole, Kent, England. Wall tiles were used which indicated use of gunpowder on the original property. Bottomley, however, was quite critical of his own work and believed his loggia was too symmetrical and lacking in the quality of <b>picturesqueness</b> and romance {{that the rest of the}} house displayed and proposed an octagonal stairway be added on the outside corner. However, his idea was rejected by the Weddells, and the loggia was completed without the staircase in 1946. Bottomley was paid $10,764 and received a ten percent commission for his drawings and construction.|$|E
500|$|As an art critic, Uzanne wrote several {{reviews of}} etchings, as in a {{critique}} of French painter and illustrator Félix Buhot: [...] "Buhot is a visionary, one obsessed by the <b>picturesqueness</b> of modern life; nervous to excess, tortured by a crowd of fleeting impressions and queer ideas, he suffered from a cruel inability to reproduce them as he wished." [...] Uzanne's written style was characterized {{by the use of}} Anglicisms and eccentric neologisms.|$|E
2500|$|E.R. Punshon of The Guardian in {{his review}} of 27 May 1938 summarised: [...] "For {{ingenuity}} of plot and construction, unexpectedness of dénouement, subtlety of characterisation, and <b>picturesqueness</b> of background, Appointment with Death may take rank among the best of Mrs. Christie's tales." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reginald Marsh {{rejected}} modern art, {{which he}} found sterile. Marsh's style {{can best be}} described as social realism. His work depicted the Great Depression and a range of social classes whose division was accentuated by the economic crash. His figures are generally treated as types. [...] "What interested Marsh was not the individuals in a crowd, but the crowd itself ... In their density and <b>picturesqueness,</b> they recall the crowds in the movies of Preston Sturges or Frank Capra".|$|E
2500|$|On 9 July {{the ship}} began its transit of the straits with {{anchorages}} at night. [...] "Typical straits weather" [...] {{was described as}} wind fresh from eastward bringing [...] "fog, rain and snow with clearer intervals" [...] and the ship noted anchorages often had boards nailed to trees naming the vessels that had used the anchorages. Making some observations {{on the way the}} ship exited the straits into the Pacific after spending the night of 15 August at an anchorage at Isla Wager known as [...] In summation the report notes [...] of the passage [...] "it is most famous for its dangers and discomforts; yet, for grandeur and <b>picturesqueness</b> its scenery has probably few rivals." ...|$|E
2500|$|The next {{orchestration}} {{was undertaken}} by the British conductor Henry Wood in 1915. He recorded a few sections of his arrangement {{on a pair of}} acoustic Columbia 78rpm discs in 1920. However, he withdrew his version when Maurice Ravel's orchestration was published and banned every public performance in the 1930s in deference to Ravel's work. Wood's arrangement has also been recorded by the London Philharmonic Orchestra under Nicholas Braithwaite and issued on the Lyrita label. All but the first of the Promenade movements were omitted and other passages extensively re-composed. Wood's orchestration was once described by Gordon Jacob as [...] "superior in <b>picturesqueness</b> to the Ravel", with its off-stage camel-bells in [...] "Cattle" [...] and grand organ in [...] "The Great Gate of Kiev".|$|E
2500|$|Les Fêtes Chinoises was Noverre's {{first great}} success. In a grudging journal entry the dramatist Charles Collé remarked in July 1754: [...] "This month, all Paris has flocked to a Chinese ballet, {{given at the}} Opéra Comique. I do not like ballets, and my aversion to dancing has greatly {{increased}} since all the theatres have become infected with ballets; but I must admit that this Chinese ballet is unusual and at least by its novelty and its <b>picturesqueness</b> it has earned {{a share of the}} applause it is given." [...] On 1July 1754, the Mercure de France observed that the ballet was mounted with extraordinary luxury [...] and in August reported that [...] "the multitude flocked to see it with unprecedented furore." ...|$|E
2500|$|It is {{essentially}} {{the production of a}} conscious artist, deliberative and selective in his methods. Don Juan Manuel [...] naturalizes the Eastern apologue in Spain, and by the laconic <b>picturesqueness</b> of his expression imports a new quality into Spanish prose which attains its full development in the hands of Juan de Valdés and Cervantes. Some of his themes are utilized for dramatic purposes by Lope de Vega in La Pobreza estimada, by Juan Ruiz de Alarcón in La Prueba de las promesas, by Calderón in La Vida es sueño, and by José de Cañizares in Don Juan de Espina en Milán; there is an evident, though remote, relation between the tale of the mancebo que casó con una mujer muy fuerte y muy brava and The Taming of the Shrew; and a more direct connexion exists between some of Don Juan Manuel's enxemplos and some of Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales.|$|E
2500|$|The {{facade of}} the house (Façade architecturale), {{designed}} by Raymond Duchamp-Villon, was not very radical by modern standards; the lintels and pediments had prismatic shapes, but otherwise the facade resembled an ordinary house of the period. The rooms were furnished in a bourgeois, colorful, and rather traditional manner, particularly compared with the paintings. [...] The critic Emile Sedeyn described Mare's work in the magazine Art et Décoration: [...] "He does not embarrass himself with simplicity, for he multiplies flowers wherever they can be put. The effect he seeks is obviously one of <b>picturesqueness</b> and gaiety. [...] He achieves it." [...] The Cubist element {{was provided by the}} paintings. [...] Despite its tameness, the installation was attacked by some critics as extremely radical, which helped make for its success. [...] This architectural installation was subsequently exhibited at the 1913 Armory Show, New York, Chicago and Boston.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1865 an {{unsigned}} review {{appeared in}} the London Review stating that [...] "Mr Dickens stands in need of no allowance on the score of having out-written himself. His fancy, his pathos, his humour, his wonderful powers of observation, his <b>picturesqueness,</b> and his versatility, are as remarkable now as they were twenty years ago." [...] But like other critics, after praising the book this same critic then turned around and disparaged it: [...] "Not that we mean to say Mr Dickens has outgrown his faults. They are as obvious as ever—sometimes even trying our patience rather hard. A certain extravagance in particular scenes and persons—a tendency to caricature and grotesqueness—and a something here and there which savours of the melodramatic, as if the author had been considering how the thing would 'tell' on the stage—are {{to be found in}} Our Mutual Friend, as in all this great novelist's productions." ...|$|E
2500|$|We {{have now}} {{reached the point}} where the old city, which had grown up haphazard, with crooked streets, wooded hills, and fertile valleys traversed by streams and winding country roads, begins to be absorbed into a new city, in which antiquity and mature are no longer respected, with streets laid out in {{accordance}} with a carefully considered symmetrical plan. ... Unfortunately, this plan, although possessing the merits of simplicity and directness, lacked entirely the equally essential elements of variety of <b>picturesqueness,</b> which demand a large degree of respect for the natural conformation of the land. The new plan was entirely deficient in sentiment and charm, and with its gradual development, little by little, the individuality, the interest, and the beauty of one choice spot after another have been swept away [...] scarcely anything remains to remind us of the primitive beauty and the fascinating diversity of natural charms we know Manhattan once possessed. The year 1811 marks the end of the little old city {{and the beginning of the}} great modern metropolis.|$|E
2500|$|Beyond the {{investigation}} into notions of Liberty {{and the reasons for}} the invasion, David V. Erdman argues that the theme of the play is the bloodshed and hardship for the common people which will result, despite Edward's belief that the war provides ordinary men with a chance to be heroes; [...] "the key to the [...] is the great Death which lies in wait for the warriors of Edward's ill-starred invasion of France." [...] Erdman believes the play is wholly ironic, and challenges critics who have read it literally and accused it of jingoism. Margaret Ruth Lowery, for example, believes that it expresses [...] "a 'boylike' delight in the <b>picturesqueness</b> of war." [...] S. Foster Damon calls it [...] "uncritically patriotic." [...] Mark Schorer interprets it as an [...] "extended defence of war and national interests." [...] Northrop Frye sees it as [...] "Rule, Britannia! in blank verse." [...] He further states, [...] "the most puzzling feature of King Edward the Third is the frankness with which Blake admits that economic conditions are the cause of the war. Industry, commerce, agriculture, manufacture and trade are the gods directing the conflict, but the conflict is glorious and the gods worthy of worship. There seems to be no use looking for irony here." ...|$|E

Madame de Vionnet may very well be going off, mayn't she?--and Mr. Newsome by the same stroke: unless indeed you've had an {{assurance}} from them to the contrary. So that if your idea's to stay for them"--it was her duty to suggest it--"you may be left in the lurch.

60|$|Lord Lambeth sat {{for nearly}} an hour with his American friends; but it is not our purpose to relate their {{conversation}} in full. He addressed a great many remarks to Bessie Alden, and finally turned toward her altogether, while Willie Woodley entertained Mrs. Westgate. Bessie herself said very little; she was on her guard, thinking of what her sister had said to her at lunch. Little by little, however, she interested herself in Lord Lambeth again, as she had done at Newport; only {{it seemed to her that}} here he might become more interesting. He would be an unconscious part of the antiquity, the impressiveness, the <b>picturesqueness,</b> of England; and poor Bessie Alden, like many a Yankee maiden, was terribly at the mercy of <b>picturesqueness.</b>|$|E

60|$|It will be observed, also, {{that there}} is a leaning first to one side, then to the other, in Harding's aspen, which marks the wild <b>picturesqueness</b> of modernism as opposed to the quiet but stiff dignity of the purist (Fig. 2); Turner occupying exactly the {{intermediate}} place.|$|E
