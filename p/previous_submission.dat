Raymond was annoyed by the homage {{which he had been}} forced to pay to the patriarch in 1135 and the dubious validity of the patriarch's election offered a handle for opposition. Eventually Raymond triumphed, and the patriarch was deposed (1139). In 1142 John Comnenus returned to the attack, but Raymond refused to recognize or renew his <b>previous</b> <b>submission,</b> and John, though he ravaged the neighborhood of Antioch, was unable to effect anything against him. When, however Raymond demanded from Manuel, who had succeeded John in 1143, the cession of some of the Cilician towns, he found that he had met his match. Manuel forced him to a humiliating visit to Constantinople, during which he renewed his oath of homage and promised to acknowledge a Greek patriarch.|$|E

40|$|Being {{considered}} as a prototype for description of oceanic rogue waves (RWs), the Peregrine breather solution of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLS) has been recently observed and intensely investigated experimentally in particular {{within the context of}} water waves. Here, we report the experimental results showing the evolution of the Peregrine solution in the presence of wind forcing in the direction of wave propagation. The results show the persistence of the breather evolution dynamics even in the presence of strong wind and chaotic wave field generated by it. Furthermore, we have shown that characteristic spectrum of the Peregrine breather persists even at the highest values of the generated wind velocities thus making it a viable characteristic for prediction of rogue waves.

40|$|Composition {{operators}} with analytic symbols on some reproducing kernel Hilbert {{spaces of}} entire functions on a complex Hilbert space are studied. The questions of their boundedness, seminormality and positivity are investigated.

Fock's type model for composition operators with linear symbols is established. As a consequence, explicit formulas for their polar decomposition, Aluthge transform and powers with positive real exponents are provided.

In par-ticular, in our <b>previous</b> <b>submissions</b> we assumed that fault events only correspond to silent transitions, and there also exist silent transitions modeling regular behavior. Moreover, la-beled transitions model regular behavior but they introduce a further form of nondeterminism because in general the same label can be shared by two or more transitions. Now, we assume that fault events can also be modeled by labeled transitions that share the same label with other fault transitions (e. g., belonging to different fault classes) and with other transitions modeling regular behavior. This requires redefining the main concepts on which our approach is based on and adapting the algorithms for diagnosis...|$|R
