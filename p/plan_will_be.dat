25|$|Supporters {{believe that}} this <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> an {{important}} part of what Bush set in place while in office. However, the policy has been criticized on two fronts. Firstly, critics have opined that the United States should deal with solving domestic issues before concentrating on space exploration. Secondly, of the funding {{over the next five years}} that Bush has proposed, only US$1 billion will be in new appropriations while the remaining US$11 billion will be reallocated from NASA's other programs, and therefore inadequate to fully realize this vision. Most of the spending for the new program, and most of the budget cuts for existing programs, are scheduled after the last year of the Bush presidency. It is unclear how the space vision will be reconciled with budgetary concerns in the longer term.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: How do {{conditions}} of security, {{either on the}} individual or societal level, affect the propensity of young adults to plan? We begin with two basic sets of hypotheses. In the positive direction, when young adults have greater security, <b>planning</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> more possible and more necessary to narrow the field of options; when young adults have lower security, <b>planning</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> less possible and less necessary. In the negative direction, when young adults have lower security, <b>planning</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> more necessary to optimize whatever prospects might exist; when young adults have greater security, there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> less need to plan because options are ample. The article tests these hypotheses using two-level linear regression models with individuals aged 18 – 35 years in 23 European countries. Our results reveal opposing trends at the individual and country levels. Young adults with greater personal security {{are more likely to}} plan than those who have fewer personal resources. Yet, young adults who live in countries with less favourable societal conditions are actually more likely to plan than those who live in countries with more favourable conditions. We conclude with explanations for, and the implications of, these opposing tendencies...|$|R

25|$|The {{small size}} of the tree and some dwarfing of foliage result from pruning the trunk, branches, and roots. Pruning is often {{the first step in}} {{transforming}} a collected plant specimen into a candidate for bonsai. The top part of the trunk may be removed to make the tree more compact. Major and minor branches that conflict with the designer's <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> removed completely, and others may be shortened to fit within the planned design. Pruning later in the bonsai's life is generally less severe, and may be done for purposes like increasing branch ramification or encouraging growth of non-pruned branches. Although pruning is an important and common bonsai practice, it must be done with care, as improper pruning can weaken or kill trees. Careful pruning throughout the tree's life is necessary, however, to maintain a bonsai's basic design, which can otherwise disappear behind the uncontrolled natural growth of branches and leaves.|$|E
500|$|While Section 2 and Section 5 {{prohibit}} jurisdictions from drawing electoral {{districts that}} dilute {{the votes of}} protected minorities, the Supreme Court has held that in some instances, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prevents jurisdictions from drawing district lines to favor protected minorities. The Court first recognized the justiciability of affirmative [...] "racial gerrymandering" [...] claims in Shaw v. Reno (1993). In Miller v. Johnson (1995), the Court explained that a redistricting plan is constitutionally suspect if the jurisdiction used race as the [...] "predominant factor" [...] in determining how to draw district lines. For race to [...] "predominate", the jurisdiction must prioritize racial considerations over traditional redistricting principles, which include [...] "compactness, contiguity, [...] respect for political subdivisions or communities defined by actual shared interests." [...] If a court concludes that racial considerations predominated, then the redistricting plan is considered [...] "racially gerrymandered" [...] and must be subjected to strict scrutiny, meaning that the redistricting <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> upheld as constitutional {{only if it is}} narrowly tailored to advance a compelling state interest. In Bush v. Vera (1996), a plurality of the Supreme Court assumed that complying with Section 2 or Section 5 constituted compelling interests, and lower courts have allowed only these two interests to justify racial gerrymandering.|$|E
