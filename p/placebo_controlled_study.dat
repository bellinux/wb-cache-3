25|$|In healthy adults, longterm visual {{episodic memory}} can be {{enhanced}} specifically through administration of the Acetylcholine esterase inhibitor Donepezil, whereas verbal episodic memory can be improved in persons with the val/val genotype of the val158met polymorphism through administration of the CNS penetrant specific catecholamine-O-methyltransferase inhibitor Tolcapone. Furthermore, episodic memory is enhanced through AZD3480, a selective agonist at the neuronal alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor, which is developed by the company Targacept. Currently, {{there are several other}} products developed by several companies—including new catecholamine-O-methyltransferase inhibitors with fewer side effects—that aim for improving episodic memory.

5000|$|In January 2014, Mesoblast {{announced}} {{positive results}} of the Phase 2 trial for back pain treatment. It included 100 patients with moderate to severe back pain that were evaluated in a randomized, <b>placebo</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>study.</b> Patients were treated across 13 sites in the US and Australia. The results showed that 69% of patients given a 6 million dose of MPCs and 62% given an 18 million dose experienced a more than 50% reduction in low back pain at 12 months. This compares to around 35% for the controls. Patients underwent the outpatient injection for a single painful degenerated lumbar level and are being evaluated for safety and efficacy over a total of 36 months to evaluate long-term treatment effects.

50|$|Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an {{autoimmune}} disease where {{the immune system}} attacks and destroys platelets in the blood, causing abnormally low platelet counts. It {{is characterized by the}} antibody-mediated destruction of platelets. Patients with ITP have accelerated clearance of circulating IgG-coated platelets via Fcγ receptor-bearing macrophages in the spleen and liver, leading to different levels of thrombocytopenia and variable degrees of mucocutaneous bleeding. Recent studies of ITP pathophysiology suggest decreased platelet production may also be {{an important component of the}} thrombocytopenia. Many patients exhibit responses to established therapies, including corticosteroids, IV immunoglobulin, anti-D, splenectomy, and rituximab. However, there are a significant minority of patients who retain persistently low platelet counts despite treatment. These patients are consistently at risk of intracranial hemorrhage and other bleeding complications. Several thrombopoiesis-stimulating therapies including eltrombopag and AMG 531 are being investigated to help combat low platelet counts in ITP patients. Rigel reported results from two Phase III clinical trials for fostamatinib as an ITP treatment in August and October 2016. The study is the second Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, <b>placebo</b> <b>controlled,</b> <b>study</b> of fostamatinib disodium in the treatment of persistent/chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura that Rigel has conducted. Primary outcome measures are defined as a stable platelet response by the end of the study (week 24) of at least 50,000/µL on at least 4 of the 6 visits between weeks 14-24. Participants received either a placebo, 100 mg, or 150 mg of the drug in the morning and evening for 24 full weeks. The first study, FIT 1 (047) met the primary endpoint in a statistically significant manner, with 18% of patients hitting the 50,000 platelets/µL of blood and no patients receiving the placebo meeting that criteria. As of June 2016, the open-label, long term extension study (049) is currently tracking 118 patients who opted to receive fostamatinib after completing either study 047 or 048.|$|E

40|$|Bacopa monniera Linn. (Brahmi) is {{an annual}} creeper {{belonging}} to family Scrophulariaceae and growing {{all over the}} Indian sub-continent in marshy areas. It is a major Medhya Rasayana used in Ayurveda for treatment of memory disorders. Large number of saponins and glycosides has been isolated from the plant. Most of the experimental and clinical {{studies have been done}} with crude extracts or standardized preparation of the two active saponins Bacosides A and B. Extracts or saponin mixture facilitate learning, improve consolidation of learned behavior and delay extinction in several models of learnt behavior in normal rats and mice as well as in chemically induced or transgenic models of Alzheimer's disease. They also prevent or reverse amnesia produced by drugs, stress or ischemic hypoxia. Other CNS effects include anti-anxiety, anti-convulsant and analgesic activity. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the mechanism of these CNS effects. Extracts as well as the bacoside preparation have been found safe and well tolerated in healthy volunteers in single dose or chronic administration for several weeks in a number of double blind <b>placebo</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>studies</b> in India and abroad.
