50|$|Instead of {{merging with}} the Milan-Venice {{line in the}} {{direction}} of Lombarby's capital, the reborn Bivi line <b>passes</b> <b>over</b> a <b>curved</b> bridge, the Maerne viaduct, which crosses more than four tracks of the Milan line. The reopened Bivi line then joins the Milan-Venice line at the Venice Mestre station throat. This arrangement separates the Trento and Milan lines from each other, and also create an alternative route for trains to Udine.|$|R
50|$|The {{accident}} {{occurred as}} the train was <b>passing</b> <b>over</b> the <b>curved</b> Fiumarella viaduct, about an hour after departing from Soveria Mannelli for Catanzaro at 6:43 am. The trailer derailed from the track, due to the rupture of the tram type draw hook, and plunged into the river below after a falling about 40 m. Inside the trailer there were 99 passengers, many of them students. Seventy-one of them lost their lives on impact, and 28 others were injured to varying degrees.|$|R

The route runs through forested areas with some homes, curving east into Roaring Brook Township and passing {{to the north}} of Elmhurst Reservoir. The road heads northeast through more forests with some fields and residences, crossing into Madison Township and passing to the northwest of Curtis Reservoir on Hamlin Road as it continues into Jefferson Township. PA 590 runs through more rural areas and <b>passes</b> <b>over</b> I-84, <b>curving</b> to the east and heading through Drinker before turning to the south.|$|R
5000|$|A {{piecewise}} linear {{model of the}} proposal log distribution results {{in a set of}} piecewise exponential distributions (i.e. segments of one or more exponential distributions, attached end to end). Exponential distributions are well behaved and well understood. The logarithm of an exponential distribution is a straight line, and hence this method essentially involves enclosing the logarithm of the density in a series of line segments. This {{is the source of the}} log-concave restriction: if a distribution is log-concave, then its logarithm is concave (shaped like an upside-down U), meaning that a line segment tangent to the <b>curve</b> will always <b>pass</b> <b>over</b> the <b>curve.</b>|$|R
40|$|For the {{quantification}} {{of vehicle}} dynamic effects at <b>passing</b> <b>over</b> turnouts {{at a higher}} speed there was developed a methodology for evaluating of acceleration measured on vehicle axle boxes in the year 2003. The methodology is based on statistical evaluation of lateral and vertical acceleration measured values at <b>passing</b> <b>over</b> both critical parts of a turnout (tongue, frog). The created methodology was used for investigation of vehicle dynamic effects by running at speed up to 230 km/h in the year 2004 in terms of high speed tests of tilting-body unit class 680 CD. There was found relatively high values of dynamic effects already at a speed 160 km/h. In terms of tilting-body unit class 680 tests at a higher speed in curves of chosen track lines of 1 st and 2 nd corridor of Czech Railways there was carried out also verification of curved turnouts state according to methodology mentioned above {{with a view to}} possibility of speed increasing at curved throats of chosen stations. Lateral vehicle dynamic effects at <b>passing</b> <b>over</b> a <b>curved</b> turnout frog area were evaluated. There were carried out simulation calculations of vehicle <b>passing</b> <b>over</b> a turnout based on measured geometric parameters of wheelset as well as chosen turnouts. Results of the calculations were compared with measurements. The increased vehicle dynamic effects found in pulsed beats character influence negatively the turnouts part (not only wheel contacting parts) as well as operating life all unsuspended parts of vehicles...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Let X and Y be regular {{strictly}} semi-stable varieties over {{a discrete}} valuation ring R and let R R ̃ be a finite ramified extension of discrete valuation rings. We expli-citly give desingularization {{procedures for the}} base change X ×R R ̃ and for the product X ×R Y. 0. Introduction. The concept of semi-stable curves was extremely fruitful for the de-velopment of arithmetic algebraic geometry. It plays {{a central role in}} analyzing the de-generation of smooth curves and so is an important tool in <b>passing</b> from <b>curves</b> <b>over</b> the field of fractions K of a discrete valuation ring R to <b>curves</b> <b>over</b> the residue field k of R. Beyond the one dimensional case the notion of semi-stability can be generalize...|$|R
50|$|In the clavichord, strings run {{transversely}} {{from the}} hitchpin rail at the left-hand end to tuning pegs on the right. Towards the right end they <b>pass</b> <b>over</b> a <b>curved</b> wooden bridge. The action is simple, with the keys being levers {{with a small}} brass tangent, {{a small piece of}} metal similar in shape and size to the head of a flat-bladed screwdriver, at the far end. The strings, which are usually of brass, or else a combination of brass and iron, are usually arranged in pairs, like a lute or mandolin. When the key is pressed, the tangent strikes the strings above, causing them to sound in a similar fashion to the hammering technique on a guitar. Unlike in a piano action, the tangent does not rebound from the string; rather, it stays in contact with the string as long as the key is held, acting as both the nut and as the initiator of sound. The volume of the note can be changed by striking harder or softer, and the pitch can also be affected by varying the force of the tangent against the string (known as Bebung). When the key is released, the tangent loses contact with the string and the vibration of the string is silenced by strips of damping cloth.|$|R

50|$|CR 526 {{continues}} into Allentown in Monmouth County {{and passes}} homes before {{it forms a}} short concurrency with CR 524 and CR 539 on Main Street. From this point, the route continues east through residential areas on Waker Avenue, leaving Allentown for Upper Freehold Township. In this area, the road passes farms {{to the north and}} homes to the south as it intersects CR 526 Spur. CR 526 heads through a mix of farmland and woodland with a few areas of development, passing through open areas of farms prior to crossing CR 43, which loops to the south of CR 526 and intersects it again a short distance later. The route passes agricultural areas to the north and woodland to the south before running through a mix of farms, woods, and residences. The road passes Red Valley Lake and heads into Millstone Township, becoming Trenton-Lakewood Road and turning to the northeast. CR 526 <b>passes</b> <b>over</b> I-195 and <b>curves</b> east into more wooded areas before intersecting CR 571 again in developed areas. At this point, CR 526 turns south to run concurrent with CR 571, passing through forested areas with a few homes.|$|R
