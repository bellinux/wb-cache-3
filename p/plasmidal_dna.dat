40|$|Background & Objective: Staphylococcus aureus {{especially}} methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains are a {{major cause}} of nosocomial and community acquired infections with high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. The role of integrons is unclear in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes among Gram-positive, such as S. aureus when compared with Gram-negative. The aims of this study were to determine MRSA and multi-drug resistant (MDR) isolates and detect the class 1, 2, and 3 integrons among clinical isolates of S. aureus. Methods: 230 non-duplicated clinical isolates of S. aureus were collected from inpatients of teaching hospitals in two provinces. Antimicrobial susceptibility of S. aureus to 16 different antibiotics was performed using the disk diffusion according to CLSI guidelines. Genomic and <b>plasmidal</b> <b>DNA</b> of all isolates were extracted using two separate Extraction Kit (Bioneer-Korea) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was used for detection of class 1, 2, and 3 integron genes. Results: Out of the 230 S. aureus isolates, 136 (59. 1...|$|E
