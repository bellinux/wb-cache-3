As a result of the changes the city's status as a World Heritage Site was reviewed by UNESCO in 2009.

5|$|In the 1960s {{and early}} 1970s {{some parts of}} Bath were unsympathetically redeveloped, {{resulting}} {{in the loss of}} some 18th- and 19th century buildings. This process was largely halted by a popular campaign which drew strength from the publication of Adam Fergusson's The Sack of Bath. Controversy has revived periodically, most recently with the demolition of the 1930s Churchill House, a neo-Georgian municipal building originally housing the Electricity Board, {{to make way for a}} new bus station. This is part of the Southgate redevelopment in which an ill-favoured 1960s shopping precinct, bus station and multi-story car park were demolished and replaced by a new area of mock-Georgian shopping streets. As a result of this and other changes, notably plans for abandoned industrial land along the Avon, the city's status as a World Heritage Site was reviewed by UNESCO in 2009.

5|$|The {{different}} <b>phases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{menstrual cycle}} correlate with women’s moods. In some cases, hormones released during the menstrual cycle can cause behavioral changes in females; mild to severe mood changes can occur. The menstrual cycle phase and ovarian hormones {{may contribute to}} increased empathy in women. The natural shift of hormone levels during the different <b>phases</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> menstrual cycle has been studied in conjunction with test scores. When completing empathy exercises, women in the follicular stage of their menstrual cycle performed better than women in their midluteal phase. A significant correlation between progesterone levels {{and the ability to}} accurately recognize emotion was found. Performances on emotion recognition tasks were better when women had lower progesterone levels. Women in the follicular stage showed higher emotion recognition accuracy than their midluteal phase counterparts. Women were found to react more to negative stimuli when in midluteal stage over the women in the follicular stage, perhaps indicating more reactivity to social stress during that menstrual cycle phase. Overall, it has been found that women in the follicular phase demonstrated better performance in tasks that contain empathetic traits.|$|E

30|$|The code phase {{difference}} between the authentic signal and spoofing signal is gradually adjusted to separate the two signals.
