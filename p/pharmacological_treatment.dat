5|$|<b>Pharmacological</b> <b>treatment</b> {{can help}} to manage {{psychiatric}} or behavioral problems. Medication {{is also used to}} control post-traumatic epilepsy; however the preventive use of anti-epileptics is not recommended. In those cases where the person is bedridden due to a reduction of consciousness, has to remain in a wheelchair because of mobility problems, or has any other problem heavily impacting self-caring capacities, caregiving and nursing are critical.|$|E
5|$|Three stages may be distinguished: {{an initial}} stage {{in which the}} {{individual}} with PD has already developed some disability requiring <b>pharmacological</b> <b>treatment,</b> a second stage associated with the development of complications related to levodopa usage, and a third stage when symptoms unrelated to dopamine deficiency or levodopa treatment may predominate.|$|E
5|$|Management {{is based}} {{primarily}} on stopping the usage of the precipitating drugs, the administration of serotonin antagonists such as cyproheptadine, and supportive care including the control of agitation, the control of autonomic instability, and the control of hyperthermia. Additionally, those who ingest large doses of serotonergic agents may benefit from gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal {{if it can be}} administered within an hour of overdose. The intensity of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms. If the symptoms are mild, treatment may only consist of discontinuation of the offending medication or medications, offering supportive measures, giving benzodiazepines for myoclonus, and waiting for the symptoms to resolve. Moderate cases should have all thermal and cardiorespiratory abnormalities corrected and can benefit from serotonin antagonists. The serotonin antagonist cyproheptadine is the recommended initial therapy, although there have been no controlled trials demonstrating its efficacy for serotonin syndrome. Despite the absence of controlled trials, {{there are a number of}} case reports detailing apparent improvement after people have been administered cyproheptadine. Animal experiments also suggest a benefit from serotonin antagonists. Cyproheptadine is only available as tablets and therefore can only be administered orally or via a nasogastric tube; it is unlikely to be effective in people administered activated charcoal and has limited use in severe cases. Additional <b>pharmacological</b> <b>treatment</b> for severe case includes administering atypical antipsychotic drugs with serotonin antagonist activity such as olanzapine. Critically ill people should receive the above therapies as well as sedation or neuromuscular paralysis. People who have autonomic instability such as low blood pressure require treatment with direct-acting sympathomimetics such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or phenylephrine. Conversely, hypertension or tachycardia can be treated with short-acting antihypertensive drugs such as nitroprusside or esmolol; longer acting drugs such as propranolol should be avoided as they may lead to hypotension and shock. The cause of serotonin toxicity or accumulation is an important factor in determining the course of treatment. Serotonin is catabolized by monoamine oxidase in the presence of oxygen, so if care is taken to prevent an unsafe spike in body temperature or metabolic acidosis, oxygenation will assist in dispatching the excess serotonin. The same principle applies to alcohol intoxication. In cases of serotonin syndrome caused by monoamine oxidase inhibitors oxygenation will not help to dispatch serotonin. In such instances, hydration is the main concern until the enzyme is regenerated.|$|E

40|$|Rationale: Impaired {{cognitive}} abilities {{are a key}} characteristic of schizophrenia. Although currently approved <b>pharmacological</b> <b>treatments</b> have demonstrated efficacy for positive symptoms, to date no <b>pharmacological</b> <b>treatments</b> successfully reverse cognitive dysfunction in these patients. Cognitively-based interventions such as cognitive remediation (CR) and other psychosocial interventions however, may improve some of the cognitive and functional deficits of schizophrenia. Given that these treatments are time-consuming and labor-intensive, maximizing their effectiveness is a priority. Augmenting psychosocial interventions with <b>pharmacological</b> <b>treatments</b> may be a viable strategy for reducing the impact of cognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia. Objective: We propose a strategy to develop <b>pharmacological</b> <b>treatments</b> that can enhance the reward-related learning processes underlying successful skill-learning in psychosocial interventions. Specifically, we review clinical and preclinical evidence and paradigms that can be utilized to develop these pharmacological augmentation strategies. Prototypes for this approach include dopamine D 1 receptor and α 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists as attractive targets to specifically enhance reward-related learning during CR. Conclusion: The approach outlined here could be used broadly to develop pharmacological augmentation strategies across a number of cognitive domains underlying successful psychosocial treatment...|$|R
25|$|Other {{experimental}} methods being researched involve substrate reduction therapy, which attempts to use alternative enzymes {{to increase the}} brain's catabolism of GM2 gangliosides {{to a point where}} residual degradative activity is sufficient to prevent substrate accumulation. One experiment has demonstrated that using the enzyme sialidase allows the genetic defect to be effectively bypassed, and as a consequence, GM2 gangliosides are metabolized so that their levels become almost inconsequential. If a safe <b>pharmacological</b> <b>treatment</b> can be developed– one that increases expression of lysosomal sialidase in neurons without other toxicity– then this new form of therapy could essentially cure the disease.|$|E
25|$|Psychiatric {{medications}} {{may also}} alleviate co-occurring conditions sometimes {{associated with the}} disorder or with symptoms such as aggression or impulsivity, including antipsychotic, antidepressant or mood-stabilizing medications, although none have yet {{been approved by the}} FDA for this purpose. For example, a study found that the antipsychotic clozapine may be effective in reducing various behavioral dysfunctions in a sample of high-security hospital inpatients with antisocial personality disorder and psychopathic traits. However, research into the <b>pharmacological</b> <b>treatment</b> of psychopathy and the related condition antisocial personality disorder is minimal, with much of the knowledge in this area being extrapolations based on what is known about pharmacology in other mental disorders.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} the TCAs {{were the first}} choice for <b>pharmacological</b> <b>treatment</b> of {{clinical}} depression. Although they are still considered to be highly effective, they have been increasingly replaced by antidepressants with an improved safety and side effect profile, such as the SSRIs and other newer antidepressants such as the novel reversible MAOI moclobemide. However, tricyclic antidepressants are possibly more effective in treating melancholic depression than other antidepressant drug classes. Newer antidepressants {{are thought to have}} fewer and less severe side effects and are also thought to be less likely to result in injury or death if used in a suicide attempt, as the doses required for clinical treatment and potentially lethal overdose (see therapeutic index) are far wider in comparison.|$|E

30|$|<b>Pharmacological</b> <b>treatments</b> of {{migraine}} headaches {{can help}} to relieve the pain and symptoms associated with migraine headache. However, migraineurs often experience side-effects of <b>pharmacological</b> <b>treatments</b> and frequent use of medications can lead to medication overuse headaches (Adams et al. 2013). The limits to <b>pharmacological</b> <b>treatments</b> may explain high usage of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) among migraineurs (Wells et al. 2011). The number of migraineurs who are using CAM treatment in conjunction with traditional medical treatments has been growing over the years (Eisenberg et al. 1998; Jacobson et al. 2009; Kaptchuck and Eisenberg 1998). Consistent with this pattern, {{a number of studies}} investigating the prevalence and patterns of CAM treatment in migraineurs have been slowly growing, however, previous studies were conducted within individual headache clinics with limited populations (Adams et al. 2013; Wells et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|Attention-deficit/hyperactivity {{disorder}} (ADHD) is a {{major public}} health issue. <b>Pharmacological</b> <b>treatments</b> {{play an important role}} in the multimodal treatment of ADHD. Currently, there is a lack of up-to-date and comprehensive evidence on how available ADHD drugs compare and rank in terms of efficacy and tolerability, in children or adolescents as well as in adults.

25|$|When {{patients}} are taking multiple medications, the discontinuation of drugs suspected of causing myoclonus {{and treatment of}} metabolic derangements may resolve some cases of myoclonus. When <b>pharmacological</b> <b>treatment</b> is indicated anticonvulsants are the main line of treatment. Paradoxical reactions to treatment are notable. Drugs which most people respond to may in other individuals worsen their symptoms. Sometimes {{this leads to the}} mistake of increasing the dose, rather than decreasing or stopping the drug. Treatment of myoclonus focuses on medications that may help reduce symptoms. Drugs used include sodium valproate, clonazepam, the anticonvulsant levetiracetam, and piracetam. Dosages of clonazepam usually are increased gradually until the patient improves or side effects become harmful. Drowsiness and loss of coordination are common side effects. The beneficial effects of clonazepam may diminish over time if the patient develops a tolerance to the drug.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, Japan was {{the first}} {{country in the world}} to approve a <b>pharmacological</b> <b>treatment</b> for ADPKD {{followed}} by Canada and Europe, which approved the drug tolvaptan for ADPKD patients in the beginning of 2015. Tolvaptan, an aquaretic drug, is a vasopressin receptor 2 (V2) antagonist. Pre-clinical studies had suggested that the molecule cAMP could be involved in the enlargement of ADPKD cysts, and studies on rodents confirmed the role of vasopressin in increasing the levels of cAMP in the kidney, which laid the basis for the conduction of clinical studies. Because data from the Consortium for Radiologic Imaging Studies of Polycystic Kidney Disease (CRISP) led by Mayo Clinic showed that total kidney volume (TKV) predicted the risk of developing renal insufficiency in patients with ADPKD, the TEMPO 3:4 trial, which enrolled patients from 129 sites worldwide from 2007 to 2009, evaluated TKV as a primary end-point to test the efficacy of tolvaptan in ADPKD patients. That study showed a significant decrease in the ratio of TKV increase and deterring of renal function decline in ADPKD patients after treatment with tolvaptan; however, because laboratory test results regarding liver function appeared elevated in a percentage of patients enrolled in that study, the approval of the drug was either delayed by regulatory agencies or, as in case of the US, altogether denied.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In some situations, {{practice}} guidelines do {{not provide}} firm evidence-based guidance regarding COPD treatment choices, especially when large trials have failed to identify subgroups of particularly good or poor responders to available medications. Methods This observational cross-sectional study explored the yield of four types of multidimensional analyses to assess the associations between the clinical characteristics of COPD patients and <b>pharmacological</b> and non-pharmacological <b>treatments</b> prescribed by lung specialists in a real-life context. Results Altogether, 2494 patients were recruited by 515 respiratory physicians. Multiple correspondence analysis and hierarchical clustering identified 6 clinical subtypes and 6 treatment subgroups. Strong bi-directional associations were found between clinical subtypes and treatment subgroups in multivariate logistic regression. However, although the overall frequency of prescriptions varied from one clinical subtype to the other {{for all types of}} <b>pharmacological</b> <b>treatments,</b> clinical subtypes were not associated with specific prescription profiles. When canonical analysis of redundancy was used, the proportion of variation in <b>pharmacological</b> <b>treatments</b> that was explained by clinical characteristics remained modest: 6. 23 %. This proportion was greater (14. 29 %) for non-pharmacological components of care. Conclusion This study shows that, although <b>pharmacological</b> <b>treatments</b> of COPD are quantitatively very well related to patients’ clinical characteristics, there is no particular patient profile that could be qualitatively associated to prescriptions. This underlines uncertainties perceived by physicians for differentiating the respective effects of available <b>pharmacological</b> <b>treatments.</b> The methodology applied here is useful to identify areas of uncertainty requiring further research and/or guideline clarification. </p...|$|R
2500|$|Treatment of tics {{present in}} {{conditions}} such as Tourette’s syndrome begins with patient, relative, teacher and peer education about {{the presentation of the}} tics. [...] Sometimes, <b>pharmacological</b> <b>treatment</b> is unnecessary and tics can be reduced by behavioral therapy such as habit-reversal therapy and/or counseling. [...] Often this route of treatment is difficult because it depends most heavily on patient compliance. [...] Once <b>pharmacological</b> <b>treatment</b> is deemed most appropriate, lowest effective doses should be given first with gradual increases. [...] The most effective drugs belong to the neuroleptic variety such as monoamine-depleting drugs and dopamine receptor-blocking drugs. [...] Of the monoamine-depleting drugs, tetrabenazine is most powerful against tics and results in fewest side effects. [...] A non-neuroleptic drug found to be safe and effective in treating tics is topiramate. Botulinum toxin injection in affected muscles can successfully treat tics; involuntary movements and vocalizations can be reduced, as well as life-threatening tics that have the potential of causing compressive myelopathy or radiculopathy. Surgical treatment for disabling Tourette’s syndrome has been proven effective in cases presenting with self-injury. [...] Deep Brain Stimulation surgery targeting the globus pallidus, thalamus and other areas of the brain may be effective in treating involuntary and possibly life-threatening tics.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{drug that}} is used is atomoxetine, a non-stimulant and a {{norepinephrine}} reuptake inhibitor (NRI), which has no addiction liability or recreational effects.
