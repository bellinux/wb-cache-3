Second, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our mechanism by a comprehensive simulation-based comparison with a suite of mechanisms found in the literature. Finally, our mechanism employs a randomized rounding technique that is of independent interest, as it solves the apportionment problem that arises in various settings where discrete resources such as parliamentary representation slots need to be divided proportionally.

Imposed reflection and contacts during and after the evaluation procedure modify the individual researcher's attitude, improve the research teams' strategies and allow for the extraction of general recommendations that are used as discipline-dependent guidelines in the university's research management. The deep insights gained in the different research disciplines and the substantial data sets on their research, support the university management in its policy decisions and in building policy instruments. Moreover, the results are used as a basis for comparison with other assessments, leading to a better understanding of the possibilities and limitations of different evaluation processes. The peer review method can be applied systematically in a pluri-annual cycle of research discipline evaluations to build up a complete overview, or it can be activated on an ad hoc basis for a particular discipline, based on demands from research teams or on strategic or policy arguments.

40|$|The {{appraisal}} of scientific quality {{is a particularly}} difficult problem. Editorial boards resort to secondary criteria including crude publication counts, journal prestige, the reputation of authors and institutions, and estimated importance and relevance of the research field, making peer review a controversial rather than a rigorous process.

The aim of this review is to go into the two pillars of contemporary medical publishing, that is the peer review process and the IF.

Paper {{presented at the}} final EERQI conference, Brussels, University Foundation. The goal of the project ‘European Educational Research Quality Indicators’ (EERQI) is to improve upon citation-only based assessments of the quality or impact of educational and other research. In this conference paper two research questions will be answered: 1) What are the results of applying the ‘intrinsic criteria’ rigour, originality, significance, integrity, and style, in a <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> <b>evaluation</b> of educational research articles? 2) What are the results of analysing the relationships between both intrinsic and extrinsic indicators, to construct {{an example of a}} prototype EERQI framework? The first question is answered by a pilot in which 78 peer reviewers assess 117 research documents according to rigour, originality, significance, integrity, style, and miscellaneous. In a second pilot, peer reviewers evaluate 20 intrinsic indicators of 177 research documents written by 268 authors. Extrinsic indicators of the same documents contain various types of web-based information. Structural model analysis using Mplus results in a measurement model with three intrinsic and two extrinsic latent factors. The outcomes support the hypothesis that the more the reviewed document is related to the reviewer‘s own area of research, the higher the document is evaluated with respect to 1) significance, originality and consistency and 2) methodological adequacy. No relationships exist between the reviewer‘s own area of research and the two extrinsic factors. These effects may reflect some subjective evaluation bias that seems to take place in peer reviewing. The outcomes support the validity of the EERQI conceptual framework and the related research.

40|$|In many {{countries}} - {{during the past}} three decades - there has been increasing alignment of public administration with neoliberal modes of governance driven by processes of globalization and privatization. Key is New Public Management (NPM) as an instrument for applying private sector or market-based techniques to public services. The paper concerns the implications and impact of these developments as they relate to the university sector where we are seeing an influx of bibliometrics to assess performativity with measures that are frequently far from adequate. These changes are related to the broader context of a globalized privatization doctrine of science policy that has gained currency in {{many countries}}. The analysis presented here probes and discusses a nexus between NPM, bibliometric performance audits, and a new paradigm in science policy. As such the paper seeks to fill an important gap in science policy studies and the literature on New Public Management more generally. It summarizes various characteristics associated with NPM, and expl icates the connection with methods of research evaluation now being introduced in academic ins titutions. It also takes up varying responses evoked within academe by the use of bibliometrics and current methods of ranking of tertiary educational institutions. Apart from gaining a better understanding of significant changes in the higher educational and research landscapes or disciplines and the interplay of these with broader economic and political trends in society at large, the aim of the paper is also to stimulate discussion and debate on current priorities, perceptions and policies governing knowledge production.
