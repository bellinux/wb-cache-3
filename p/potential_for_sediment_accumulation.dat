40|$|The {{recurrence}} {{of the same}} types of sequence stratigraphic surface through geologic time defines cycles of change in accommodation or sediment supply, which correspond to sequences in the rock record. These cycles may be symmetrical or asymmetrical, and may or may not include all types of systems tracts that may be expected within a fully developed sequence. Depending on the scale of observation, sequences and their bounding surfaces may be ascribed to different hierarchical orders. Stratal stacking patterns combine to define trends in geometric character that include upstepping, forestepping, backstepping and downstepping, expressing three types of shoreline shift: forced regression (forestepping and downstepping at the shoreline), normal regression (forestepping and upstepping at the shoreline) and transgression (backstepping at the shoreline). Stacking patterns that are independent of shoreline trajectories may also be defined on the basis of changes in depositional style that can be correlated regionally. All stratal stacking patterns reflect the interplay of the same two fundamental variables, namely accommodation (the space available <b>for</b> <b>potential</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>accumulation)</b> and <b>sediment</b> supply. Deposits defined by specific stratal stacking patterns form the basic constituents of any sequence stratigraphic unit, from sequence to systems tract and parasequence. Changes in stratal stacking patterns define the position and timing of key sequence stratigraphic surfaces. Precisely which surfaces are selected as sequence boundaries varies as a function of which surfaces are best expressed {{within the context of the}} depositional setting and the preservation of facies relationships and stratal stacking patterns in that succession. The high degree of variability in the expression of sequence stratigraphic units and bounding surfaces in the rock record means ideally that the methodology used to analyze their depositional setting should be flexible from one sequence stratigraphic approach to another. Construction of this framework ensures the success of the method in terms of its objectives to provide a process-based understanding of the stratigraphic architecture.

To address this question, we perform a 6 year simulation with a strongly eddying ocean model. We release two passive tracers, with settling velocities {{that are consistent with}} silt and clay size particles. Our experiments show contrasting behavior between the silt fraction and the lighter clay. Due to its larger settling velocity, the silt fraction reaches a quasisteady state within a few years, with abyssal sedi-mentation rates that match net input. In contrast, clay settles only slowly, and its distribution is heavily stratified, being transported mainly along isopycnals. Yet, both size classes display a significant and persistent concentra-tion minimum over the Zapiola Rise. We show that the Zapiola Anticyclone, a strong eddy-driven vortex that cir-culates around the Zapiola Rise, is a barrier to sediment transport, and hence prevents significant <b>accumulation</b> of <b>sediments</b> on the Rise. We conclude that sediment transport by the turbulent circulation in the Argentine Basin alone cannot account <b>for</b> the preferred <b>sediment</b> <b>accumulation</b> over the Rise.

30|$|Reef {{islands are}} {{concentrated}} in intraplate locations, most commonly in linear groups that mark lines of submerged volcanic islands above which (atoll/barrier) reef has grown. This situation is exemplified by several linear reef-island groups in the Federated States of Micronesia, French Polynesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, and Tuvalu {{as well as the}} western islands of the Hawaii group (Fig.  6). The large number of reef islands is explainable by their tendency to develop on broad reef surfaces throughout the low-latitude Pacific. Yet this tendency has also been assisted by Late Holocene sea-level fall within the Pacific that has seen some reef surfaces emerge by around 1  m within the past few thousand years, providing foci <b>for</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>accumulation</b> that has manifestly aided the growth of large reef islands (Dickinson 2004); examples have been described from the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu (McLean and Hosking 1991; Yamaguchi et al. 2009).

40|$|Gully erosion is a {{widespread}} problem in the Borana plateau. Gullies are the main pathway <b>for</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>accumulation</b> in community ponds, especially during heavy rains, which reduces pond capacity. Sediment movement in gullies can be substantially reduced by installation of sieve structures that slow down water flows and allow sediment to settle out of suspension. Sieves can be easily constructed from trees by community labour at low cost. The community should develop a landscape-level plan and follow a suitable sieve design. Project Kalo collaborators have demonstrated that a series of sieve structures down a secondary gully in the Dikale pond enclosure can effectively trap sediment. The main gullies feeding ponds have large catchments generating rushing flood-waters that destroy sieve structures downstream. The appropriate, comprehensive treatment is to begin at the gully head with brush barriers to steer overland flows away from the gully, and branch layers to protect the head cut itself. When gully head treatments are accompanied {{by a series of}} sieves in the main channel, gully erosion can be arrested, gully floor and walls revegetated and sediement captured.

40|$|Progradation and {{aggradation}} of {{the modern}} continental margin in northern Taranaki Basin {{has resulted in the}} deposition of a thick and rapidly accumulated Pliocene-Pleistocene sedimentary succession. It includes the predominantly muddy Giant Foresets Formation, and the underlying sandy Mangaa Formation. Investigation of the internal attributes and depositional systems associated with the Giant Foresets Formation suggests that it would provide very little effective reservoir for hydrocarbon accumulations, although it does provide essential seal and overburden properties. While the sand-dominated Mangaa Formation could be a hydrocarbon reservoir, drilling so far has yet to reveal any significant hydrocarbon shows. Undoubtedly the most significant contribution that the Giant Foresets and Mangaa Formations have had on petroleum systems in northern Taranaki Basin is the cumulative effect that rapid and substantial accumulation has had on maturation and migration of hydrocarbons in the underlying formations. Palinspastic restoration of a seismic reflection profile across the Northern Graben, together with isopach mapping of stratigraphic section for biostratigraphic stages, indicates that the thickest part of the Pliocene-Pleistocene succession is along the central axis of the Northern Graben. Deposition of this succession contributed substantially to subsidence within the graben, providing further accommodation <b>for</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>accumulation.</b> Isopach and structure contour maps also reveal the extent to which submarine volcanic massifs were exposed along the axis of the graben and the timing of movement on major faults...|$|R

40|$|Intensification of {{agriculture}} {{has resulted in}} increased soil degradation and erosion, with associated pollution of surface waters. Small field wetlands, constructed along runoff pathways, offer one option for slowing down and storing runoff {{in order to allow}} more time for sedimentation and for nutrients to be taken up by plants or micro-organisms. This paper describes research to provide quantitative evidence for the effectiveness of small field wetlands in the UK landscape. Ten wetlands were built on four farms in Cumbria and Leicestershire, UK. Annual surveys of <b>sediment</b> and nutrient <b>accumulation</b> in 2010, 2011 and 2012 indicated that most sediment was trapped at a sandy site (70 tonnes over 3 years), compared to a silty site (40 tonnes over 3 years) and a clay site (2 tonnes over 3 years). The timing of rainfall was more important than total annual rainfall <b>for</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>accumulation,</b> with most <b>sediment</b> transported in a few intense rainfall events, especially when these coincided with bare soil or poor crop cover. Nutrient concentration within sediments was inversely related to median particle size, but the total mass of nutrients trapped was dependent on the total mass of sediment trapped. Ratios of nutrient elements in the wetland sediments were consistent between sites, despite different catchment characteristics across the individual wetlands. The nutrient value of sediment collected from the wetlands was similar to that of soil in the surrounding fields; dredged sediment was considered to have value as soil replacement but not as fertiliser. Overall, small field wetlands can make a valuable contribution to keeping soil out of rivers...|$|R
40|$|The {{vertical}} accretion of salt marshes {{is mainly}} due to flow reduction and wave damping by vegetation. However, {{the details of}} the hydrodynamics are only partially understood, and have been studied mainly in the laboratory. This study presents detailed field investigations of the water flow in a Spartina maritima salt-marsh in the Ria Formosa, a shallow, meso-tidal lagoon in Southern Portugal. Detailed velocity profiles were obtained within and above the 30 cm high canopy using a high-precision velocimeter. Results show that the influence of the bottom becomes negligible a few centimetres above the bed, and that the flow depends on the vegetation density at each level of the canopy. When the canopy is partially emergent or is only slightly submerged, the upward increase of horizontal velocity is roughly linear. A more drastic flow reduction exists when the canopy is well submerged, with a slow, nearly constant velocity in the denser part of the canopy and a faster, logarithmic shaped velocity profile above. This dampening effect of the vegetation is expected to promote sedimentation. However, the short-term sedimentation rate obtained with sediment traps during fair-weather conditions is usually lower in the Spartina marsh than in the surrounding areas. Therefore, the effect of the Spartina canopy <b>for</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>accumulation</b> seems to be more that of erosion protection during storms than of sedimentation enhancement during normal conditions.

40|$|Three-dimensional facies {{variability}} in coarse clastic sedimentary rocks (breccia, conglomerates and coarse-grained sandstones) {{at the base}} of the Ramdurg Formation suggests terrestrial scree and fans giving way downslope to fluvial sediments along the margin of the Mesoproterozoic Bagalkot basin in India. In consistency with the basic tenet of Precambrian alluvial sedimentation, fluvial architectural elements and field location-specific consistency in channel-flow direction support an invariably braided pattern for the rivers, although the architectural element-packaging pattern does show distinct changes downslope, with channel belts thinning and becoming more regular in their geometry. With possible persistence of a semi-arid climate, downslope change in flow durability in the channels was controlled primarily by water discharge, depending on position of the channels with respect to the mean level of the water table–basin-margin slope intersection. Confined between an unconformity below and a granular lag succeeded by thoroughly wave-featured sandstone, and argillite-carbonate above, the coarse and poorly sorted clastic sedimentary rocks of the basal Ramdurg are interpreted as a base-level lowstand product, for which the sedimentation rate exceeded the rate of space creation <b>for</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>accumulation.</b> Consequently, the fan succession as a whole is coarsening-upward. Fluvial sections, nonetheless, fine upward as the depositional slope gradient became progressively reduced with aggradation of channels.

40|$|The {{majority}} of the world 2 ̆ 7 s mangrove forests occur on mostly mineral sediments of fluvial origin. Two perspectives exist on the biogeomorphic development of these forests, i. e. that mangroves are opportunistic, with forest development primarily driven by physical processes, or alternatively that biophysical feedbacks strongly influence sedimentation and resulting geomorphology. On the Firth of Thames coast, New Zealand, we evaluate these two possible scenarios <b>for</b> <b>sediment</b> <b>accumulation</b> and forest development using high-resolution sedimentary records and a detailed chronology of mangrove-forest (Avicennia marina) development since the 1950 s. Cores were collected along a shore-normal transect of known elevation relative to mean sea level (MSL). Activities for lead- 210 (Pb- 210), caesium- 137 (Cs- 137) and beryllium- 7 (Be- 7), and sediment properties were analysed, with Pb- 210 <b>sediment</b> <b>accumulation</b> rates (SARs), compensated for deep subsidence (similar to 8 mm yr(- 1)) used as a proxy for elevation gain. At least four phases of forest development since the 1950 s are recognized. An old-growth forest developed by the late- 1970 s with more recent seaward forest expansion thereafter. Excess 210 Pb profiles from the old-growth forest exhibit relatively low SARs near the top (7 - 12 mm yr(- 1)) and bottom (10 - 22 mm yr(- 1)) of cores, separated by an interval of higher SARs (33 - 100 mm yr(- 1)). A general trend of increasing SAR over time characterizes the recent forest. Biogeomorphic evolution of the system is more complex than simple mudflat accretion/progradation and mangrove-forest expansion. Surface-elevation gain in the old-growth forest displays an asymptotic trajectory, with a secondary depocentre developing on the seaward mudflat from the mid- 1970 s. Two-to ten-fold increases in 210 Pb SARs are unambiguously large and occurred years to decades before seedling recruitment, demonstrating that mangroves do not measurably enhance sedimentation over annual to decadal timescales. This suggests that mangrove-forest development is largely dependent on physical processes, with forests occupying mudflats once they reach a suitable elevation in the intertidal.

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} hydrodynamic {{and sediment}} transport {{models have been}} developed and applied to the Ria de Aveiro lagoon, Portugal. The application consisted {{in the study of}} the residual circulation, the residence time as well as the sediment dynamics in the lagoon. High residence time for particles situated at the far end of the main channels points out that they are retained for a long time and tend to remain there, with high probability of being deposited into the bed. Low residence time for the central areas implies that the particles are flushed out more rapidly toward the lagoon mouth, revealing that the water and the particles exchange are very effective there. Although the residual circulation due to the rivers induces an overall transport toward the lagoon mouth, the residual circulations due to the winds induce particular circulation patterns (clockwise or counter-clockwise eddies) at some locations of the lagoon, depending on the wind direction. It was found that the suspended sediment concentrations along the main channels are induced by tidal asymmetries (resulting in areas of ebb and flood dominance), as well as by the wind stress and rivers runoff effects. They contribute, in general, to increase the sediment export toward the ocean, although the wind stress may induce currents and circulations in the opposite direction of the tidal currents. High turbid zones are observed for strong tidal currents, associated with tidal asymmetries, as well as with high rivers runoff.

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2001 Processes {{controlling}} the {{spatial and temporal}} variability of sea ice sediment inclusions in the shallow-marine environment of Elson Lagoon near Barrow, Alaska, were studied by modeling the <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>sediment</b> resuspension during the 1998, 1999 and 2000 fall freeze-up events and examining sea ice cores from the post-freeze-up ice cover. Resuspension potential was controlled spatially by the local bathymetry and interannually by wind speed and fetch. Increases in resuspension potential corresponded to greater sea ice sediment content. Sediments occurred exclusively as aggregates confined to brine inclusions in the ice and exhibited a tendency toward a clustered spatial distribution, because of their exclusion from growing frazil ice crystals. Sea ice sediment concentrations ranged from 24 mg/l to 1474 mg/l and were positively correlated with the cross-sectional area of aggregates and negatively correlated with the minimum distance between neighboring aggregates, implying that sediment aggregation occurred during the solidification of the ice cover...|$|R
40|$|The St. Anthony Falls Laboratory was {{contracted}} by Short ElBott Hendrickson {{to perform}} an assessment of potential sedimentation related issues associated with the installation of a flow diversion structure at the Minneapolis Water Works raw water intake. The Minneapolis Water Works raw water intake withdraws water from the Mississippi river at approximately river mile 858. 5, Following treatment, the water becomes the primary water supply for Minneapolis and some suburbs. To continue to operate following a contaminant spill upstream of the intake requires the installation of a diversion structure which can effectively divert non~water soluble contaminants past the intake structure. The project involved the review of key riverine related issues including: • The <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> siltation {{to occur in the}} region downstream of the diversion structure between the island and intake. • The <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> erosion of the far bank and the island caused by channel constriction. • The <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> de~pening of the primary channel due to the constriction. • The <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>sediment</b> and contaminants to enter the downstream end of the channel. • The general stability of the island. In addition to these issues, several secondary operational related issues were also reviewed. The City of Minneapolis, water Works Dike Diversio...|$|R
40|$|Anthropogenic {{radionuclide}} signatures {{associated with}} nuclear testing are increasingly utilized in environmental science to explore recent sedimentation. In this study, we assess {{the suitability of}} Pu radioisotope analysis in floodplain lake environments in the Amazon Basin to form geochronologies during the 20 th century. The Pu- 240 + Pu- 239 (Pu 240 + 239) signatures in six sediment cores indicate <b>sediment</b> <b>accumulation</b> rates in the floodplain lakes of the major rivers; Amazon (2. 3 mm year(- 1)), Tapajos (10. 2 and 2. 4 mm year(- 1)) and Madeira (3. 4, 4. 2 and 6. 2 mm year(- 1)). The {{results from this study}} show that Pu 240 + 239 fallout activities, and the well documented (Pu- 240 /Pu- 239) atomic ratios of the above ground nuclear tests which began in the 1950 s, are sufficient and well preserved in Amazon flood-plain lake sediments to infer chronologies. Lead- 210 dating analyses in the same sediment cores produced comparable <b>sediment</b> <b>accumulation</b> rates at three of the six sites. The differences between dating methods may be attributed to the different time scale these dating methods represent and/or in the solubility between Pb and Pu along the sediment column. The geochronologies derived from the Pu 240 + 239 and Pb- 210 methods outlined in this work are of interest to identify the effects of changing <b>sediment</b> <b>accumulation</b> rates during the previous century as a result of development, including deforestation, along the Amazon Basin which increased towards the middle of the 20 th century. This study shows that Pu dating provides a viable alternative geochronology tool <b>for</b> recent <b>sediment</b> <b>accumulation</b> (previous similar to 60 years) along the Amazon Basin.
