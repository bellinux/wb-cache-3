40|$|We use particle-in-cell (PIC) {{simulations}} of a collisionless, electron-ion plasma with a decreasing background magnetic field, B, {{to study the}} effect of velocity-space instabilities on the viscous heating and thermal conduction of the plasma. If B decreases, the adiabatic invariance of the magnetic moment gives rise to <b>pressure</b> <b>anisotropies</b> with p_||,j > p_,j (p_||,j and p_,j represent the pressure of species j (=i or e) parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field). Linear theory indicates that, for sufficiently large anisotropies, different velocity-space instabilities can be triggered. These instabilities, which grow on scales comparable to the electron and ion Larmor radii, in principle {{have the ability to}} pitch-angle scatter the particles, limiting the growth of the anisotropies. Our PIC simulations focus on the nonlinear, saturated regime of the instabilities. This is done through the permanent decrease of the magnetic field by an imposed shear in the plasma. Our results show that, in the regime 2 ≲β_j ≲ 20 (β_j ≡ 8 π p_j/B^ 2), the saturated ion and electron <b>pressure</b> <b>anisotropies</b> are controlled by the combined effect of the oblique ion firehose (OIF) and the fast magnetosonic/whistler (FM/W) instabilities. These instabilities grow preferentially on the ion Larmor radius scale, and make the ion and electron <b>pressure</b> <b>anisotropies</b> nearly equal: Δ p_e/p_||,e≈Δ p_i/p_||,i (where Δ p_j=p_,j - p_||,j). We also quantify the thermal conduction of the plasma by directly calculating the mean free path of electrons along the mean magnetic field, which we find strongly depends on whether B decreases or increases.

40|$|The magnetorotational {{instability}} (MRI) is {{a crucial}} mechanism of angular momentum transport {{in a variety of}} astrophysical accretion disks. In systems accreting at well below the Eddington rate, such as the central black hole in the Milky Way (Sgr A*), the plasma in the disk is essentially collisionless. We present a nonlinear study of the collisionless MRI using first-principles particle-in-cell plasma simulations. We focus on local two-dimensional (axisymmetric) simulations, deferring more realistic three-dimensional simulations to future work. For simulations with net vertical magnetic flux, the MRI continuously amplifies the magnetic field, B, until the Alfven velocity, v(A), is comparable to the speed of light, c (independent of the initial value of v(A) /c). This is consistent with the lack of saturation of MRI channel modes in analogous axisymmetric MHD simulations. The amplification of the magnetic field by the MRI generates a significant <b>pressure</b> <b>anisotropy</b> in the plasma (with the pressure perpendicular to B being larger than the parallel pressure). We find that this <b>pressure</b> <b>anisotropy</b> in turn excites mirror modes and that the volume-averaged <b>pressure</b> <b>anisotropy</b> remains near the threshold for mirror mode excitation.

One model, referred to here as T 89 R, is basically the magnetic field model of Tsyganenko (1989) but is modified {{by the addition of}} an inner eastward ring current at a radial distance of ∼ 3 RE as suggested by observation. The other is a combination of the T 89 R model and the long version of the magnetic field model of Tsyganenko (1987) such that the former dominates the magnetic field in the inner magnetosphere, whereas the latter prevails in the distant tail. The distribution of plasma pressure, which is required to balance the magnetic force for each of these two field models, is computed along the tail axis in the midnight meridian.

It is found that the J×B force obtained from the Tsyganenko field model is not curl-free. The curl-free part of the J×B force in an empirical field model can be balanced by the gradient of the isotropic pressure, while the nonzero curl of the J×B force can only be associated with the <b>pressure</b> <b>anisotropy.</b> The plasma pressure and anisotropy in the near-Earth plasma sheet are numerically calculated to obtain a static equilibrium consistent with the Tsyganenko field model both in the noon-midnight meridian and in the equatorial plane.

This assumption, however, is an inadequate description of space plasmas, such as plasmas in the Earth’s magnetosheath and inner magnetosphere, as well as in the solar corona, where strong magnetic fields give rise to highly anisotropic plasma pressures. Specifically, particle collisions are not frequent enough to balance the particle motions along and perpendicular to the magnetic field, thus the corresponding parallel and perpendicular pressure components are different.

40|$|Quark-gluon plasma {{during its}} initial phase after its {{production}} in heavy-ion collisions {{is expected to}} have substantial <b>pressure</b> <b>anisotropies.</b> In order to model this situation by a strongly coupled N= 4 super-Yang-Mills plasma with fixed anisotropy by means of AdS/CFT duality, two models have been discussed in the literature. Janik and Witaszczyk have considered a geometry involving a comparatively benign naked singularity, while more recently Mateos and Trancanelli have used a regular geometry involving a nontrivial axion field dual to a parity-odd deformation of the gauge theory by a spatially varying theta parameter. We study the (rather different) implications of these two models on the heavy-quark potential as well as jet quenching and compare their respective predictions with those of weakly coupled anisotropic plasmas.
