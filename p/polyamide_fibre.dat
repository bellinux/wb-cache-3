50|$|The {{concentration}} of {{efforts in the}} 50’s of XX c. {{on the development of}} fertilising track did not mean one-sided modernisation of the factory. In that period, the preparations for further development were started, aiming to broaden the range of products and implement modern and highly refined products. In 1952-1953 the installation for methanol synthesis was built and launched on the basis of experiences from the half-technological installation existing in the Research Laboratory since 1934. The produced methanol was the material for formalin and methenamine in the newly constructed and launched installations in that period. In 1953 the first organic product was started to produce on the technological scale - formalin, with capability of 4500 tons per year. Both ammonia intensification as well as the formalin installation were the investments designed and performed independently. The next milestone to change in the productive profile of the company was the start of the construction of the installation of the caprolactam, a half-product to <b>polyamide</b> <b>fibre</b> and plastic production. Year 1957, the anniversary and thirtieth year in the history of “Mościce” was called “the year of great launches”. In addition to the launch of the caprolactam plant, a new mercury salt electrolysis with capacity of 18000 tons per year was commissioned. The intensification of production and construction of new installations caused the increase in demand of the plants for steam and electric power, which could not be obtained by the intensification of the existing heat and power plant (EC I). The decision on construction of a new heat and power plant with capacity of 50 MW with possibility of further development was made. The new heat and power plan (so-called EC II) was built in years 1954-1958. The first stage of the EC II construction was the installation of three steam boilers and two bleeding-condensing turbines.|$|E

This production {{was carried out}} at Automatex needle punching line, which consists of carding, cross lapper and needle punching machine.

The EMSE of the as-produced needle-punched nonwoven fabric was determined using a network analyzer as specified in ASTM D 4935 - 10 in the frequency range of 15 – 3000 MHz. Electromagnetic shielding test shows that needle-punched nonwoven fabric produced from 1. 7 -dtex silver-coated <b>polyamide</b> <b>fibre</b> has the highest shielding value of 36. 53 dB in the frequency range of 15 – 3000 MHz. The EMSE of needle-punched nonwoven fabric with fibre fineness of 1. 7 dtex increased from 11. 00 dB maximum to 36. 53 dB in the 15 – 3000 MHz frequency range. It was seen that as the frequency increases, reflection values of the needle-punched nonwoven fabric decrease at floating mode, while absorption values of the nonwoven fabric increase at floating mode in the frequency range of 15 – 3000 MHz.

40|$|Highly twisted {{oriented}} polymer fibres {{and carbon}} nanotube yarns show large scale torsional actuation from volume expansion {{that can be}} induced, for example, thermally or by electrochemical charging. When formed into spring-like coils, the torsional actuation within the fibre or yarn generates powerful tensile actuation per muscle weight. For further development of these coil actuators and for the practical application of torsional actuators, {{it is important to}} standardise methods for characterising both the torsional stroke (rotation) and torque generated. By analogy with tensile actuators, we here introduce a method to measure both the free stroke and blocked torque in a one-end-tethered fibre. In addition, the torsional actuation can be measured when operating against an externally applied torque (isotonic) and actuation against a return spring fibre (variable torque). A theoretical treatment of torsional actuation was formulated using torsion mechanics and evaluated using a commercially available highly-oriented <b>polyamide</b> <b>fibre.</b> Good agreement between experimental measurements and calculated values was obtained. The analysis allows the prediction of torsional stroke under any external loading condition based on the fundamental characteristics of the actuator: free stroke and stiffness...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the dynamic {{viscoelastic}} properties of long organic fibre [aramid fibre (KF), polyvinyl alcohol fibre (VF) and <b>polyamide</b> <b>fibre</b> (PA 6)) reinforced polypropylene in the molten state. Long organic fibres mixed with polypropylene fibres by an apparatus called a "fibre separating and flying machine" were compression moulded into 3 mm thick composites. Dynamic viscoelastic properties of these composites were measured in the molten state using a rotational parallel plate rheometer. It {{was found that the}} dependence of angular frequency on storage modulus, G', for long organic fibre reinforced polypropylene is different from that of volume fraction of fibre, Vf and the relationships depend on the characteristics of the reinforcing organic fibres. The slope of the dynamic viscosity, eta' vs. angular frequency, omega curves increases gradually up to 45 degrees with increasing V-f. Influence of fibre content on dynamic viscoelastic properties depends on the organic fibre used. For low fibre content, G' increases with increasing V-f {{in the same way as}} eta', However, the opposite trend is observed for high fibre content composites. It can be deduced that there is an apparent yield from the relations between complex viscosity, eta* and complex modulus, G*.

40|$|The thermal {{oxidation}} of an aromatic <b>polyamide</b> <b>fibre,</b> namely poly(m-xylylene adipamide) has been investigated. The volatile and non-volatile products of oxidation identified using T. L. C., H. P. L. C. and G. C. -M. S. include homologous series of monocarboxylic acids, dicarboxylic acids, n-alkyl amines, diamines and aldehydes. Furthermore, several aromatics, ketones and amides were also identified. Mechanisms for their derivation {{have been proposed}} {{which are based on}} oxidation reactions already established in polymer chemistry. These include a mechanism of β scission by an alkoxy radical thought to be responsible for the creation of the homologous series. MXD, 6 fibres were also spun incorporating 100, 200 and 400 ppm of a cobalt catalyst and the effect of the metal ions on the oxygen uptake of the fibres was investigated. The results show a consistent increase in the rate of oxygen uptake as the concentration of the cobalt is increased. Furthermore, T. G. A. oxidative degradation studies, conducted at isothermal temperatures in the solid state, show decreases in the activation energies associated with fibre oxidation with increased cobalt concentrations, implying the cobalt is a catalyst for oxidation.

40|$|Solid {{histidine}} {{shows no}} reaction during ozonation. In contrast, the ozonation of aqueous solutions of histidine reveals quick and effective oxidation. Ozone consumption during histidine treatment is passing two phases. Depending on {{the duration of}} the ozone treatment the consumption rate is decreasing in a ratio of 3. 5 : 1. Histidine ozonation in unbuffered liquors shows a characteristic decline of pH value in three phases. The pH shift towards acidic values points out that the imidazole ring of histidine is preferentially attacked. Depending on {{the duration of the}} ozone treatment the formation of about eight decomposition products of different polarity at pH 7. 2 are detected by HPLC-analysis. Thin layer chromatography of the ozonation product resulted in the detection of six different products. The composition of the product mixture depends on the pH value of the liquor. Variation of pH within a range of 3 and 11 leads to a higher number of products with increasing pH. At the same time, the amounts of the different products are more equally distributed on increasing pH. At high pH there is no product dominating the mixture whereas at lower pH particular products are preferentially formed. Amino acid analysis of the product mixtures obtained by histidine ozonation without prior hydrolysis showed the formation of aspartic acid (Asp), asparagine (Asn) and serine (Ser). Serine formation is considered to result from secondary decomposition of aspartic acid. As a result of ozonolytic histidine decomposition the formation of acetaldehyde as well as imidazole was found by mass spectroscopic analysis. In addition, a product with high molecular mass (M= 305 g/mol) is detected that could not be identified. Ozonation of histidine leads to the formation of different radical species which are detectable by means of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Formation of these species resp. their stability could be enhanced using spin trapping agents. Impact of ozone on the <b>polyamide</b> <b>fibre</b> Nylon®- 6. 6 leads to smoothing of the fibre surface in comparison to untreated material. Apparently, ozone is able to remove inhomogeneities from the fibre surface. Using spin trapping agents, formation of radicals in polyamide during ozonation is detected by EPR. Polyglycine shows the same behaviour, while the ozonation of glycine shows no radical formation. These facts point to a direct attack of the peptide bonds during ozonation. Changes in the surface topology of ozone treated wool tops show parallels to chlorine treated wool resulting in shrivelled appearance of the surface. In addition, smoothing effects become apparent due to rounding of the cuticle scales. On parts of the fibre the scales are removed to a very high extent, so the structure can hardly be recognized. In comparison to untreated wool top, a decrease of the felting behaviour is assessed. Ozonation of wool fabrics also leads to a smoothing of the surface. The levelling is due to an extraction of proteinic materials which cover the surface of the single fibres and act as a kind of glue. The fabric obtains a brittle handle. The effectiveness of an ozone treatment of wool with regard to bleaching resp. the extent of weakening the fibre depend on the humidity during the ozone treatment. The fibre is apparently hydrophilized. Chemical composition of wool, i. e. its amino acid composition undergoes significant changing during exposure to ozone. Not only cystine is oxidised to cysteic acid, in accordance with the results of histidine decomposition an increase of the content of the amino acids Asp+Asn and Ser is detected, furthermore, a decrease of the histidine amount in the fibre. Different from polyamide, radical activity is detected in untreated wool top. Nevertheless, radical formation during ozonation of wool is detected. Use of spin trapping agents leads to the detection of additional radical species as well as an increase in intensity of the radical peaks in the EPR spectra...|$|E

The {{performance of a}} fibre composite part depends {{to a great extent}} on the fibre orientation pattern. In this regard, the rheology of fibre suspensions is important and more experimental and theoretical developments are needed for suspensions in practical applications. This thesis deals with both issues and provides new insights into the rheological behaviour of fibre suspensions. The first part of the thesis focuses on the problem of measuring the viscosity of a suspension of fibres that are not short compared to the dimensions of the measurement device. Various geometry effects in shear using parallel-plate and cone-and-plate configurations are examined. A modified cone-and-plate device of unusually large diameter and truncation is developed that provides reduced free edge and wall effects. In a subsequent study using the modified geometry, a systematic study is carried out on semi-concentrated suspensions of <b>polyamide</b> <b>fibres</b> in silicone oil to understand the effect of relevant microstructural properties, i. e. volume fraction, aspect ratio and the absolute size of the fibres.

This cracking appears when original fibre is treated at high temperature and it is due to the breakage of the skin/core structure of polyamide 6. 6. This cracking has been demonstrated by the determination of drying kinetics in a thermogravimetric test that has been developed for this fibrePostprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|<b>Polyamide</b> and {{polyester}} <b>fibres</b> {{have been}} subjected to flex fatigue by pulling to and fro over a pin, in order to investigate the alternative damage modes, namely cracks along kink-bands due to compression, and axial splitting due to shear stresses. Initial studies determined the conditions that were sufficiently severe to give a short enough test time but not so severe that abrasion on the pin was dominant. Fibres were then cycled for varying periods, the damage viewed in a scanning electron microscope, and the change in tensile properties, including residual strength, determined...|$|R
40|$|Compounds were {{prepared}} with isotactic polypropylene (iPP) matrix and recycled <b>polyamide</b> 66 <b>fibres</b> (PA 66), which were obtained as soft waste in industrial production process. Blends with pristine PA 66 pellets {{were prepared}} as comparison. The blends showed {{the presence of}} PA 66 particles dispersed in the PP continuous phase. Considering the incompatibility of the two polymers the addition of isotactic polypropylene grafted with maleic anhydride (iPPgMA) as compatibilizer was investigated: the blends were characterized by thermal, mechanical, dynamic-mechanical and morphological analyses. The presence of the compatibilizer significantly influences the morphology of the blends, inducing a finer dispersion and promoting interfacial adhesion. The characterization of pristine and recycled PA 66 did not show a meaningful difference {{in the value of}} molecular weight, on the other hand marked differences were presented in the flexural moduli of the two materials; analogous differences were exhibited by the blends: compounds prepared with recycled PA 66 showed flexural moduli higher than compatibilized blends with pristine PA 66...|$|R
