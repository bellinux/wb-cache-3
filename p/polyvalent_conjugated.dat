40|$|The {{objective}} of the research was to study clinical and epidemiological features and outcomes of generalized forms of meningococcal infection in children from Krasnoyarsk and Krasnoyarsk Territory {{during the period from}} 2012 to 2016. Materials and methods. A retrospective analysis of 57 medical records of hospital patients with generalized forms of meningococcal infection was carried out in the infectious and resuscitative departments of the Krasnoyarsk Clinical Hospital No. 1 from 2012 to 2016, including 12 protocols of pathologoanatomical studies of the deceased patients and 45 medical cards of ambulatory patients – convalescents of the disease from 2012 to 2016. Results. The epidemic situation for meningococcal infection in Krasnoyarsk Territory from 2012 to 2016 is characterized by signs of inter-epidemic period. Children of the first 3 years of life are in the group of high risk for the development of GFMI, which accounts for 74 % {{of the total number of}} cases of children aged 14. There are signs of meningococcal infection « aging » – in the age structure the number of children in the first year of life decreased, while the proportion of children aged 4 – 7 and 7 – 14 increased compared to previous decades. There is a tendency to a decrease in the proportion of the combined forms with an increase in the frequency of « pure » meningococcemia. In recent years there has been an « atypical » course of generalized forms of the disease, when classical hemorrhagic necrotic rashes appear only on the 3 rd – 4 th day of the disease. In convalescents who underwent a combined form of MI and « pure » meningitis severe residual effects leading patients to disability are possible to develop. Conclusion. The use of <b>polyvalent</b> <b>conjugated</b> vaccines in potential risk groups will allow us to reduce the morbidity and mortality from generalized forms of meningococcal infection, including younger children. </p...|$|E
40|$|A <b>polyvalent</b> <b>conjugate</b> (fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled {{antibody}} reagent) containing serogroups A, B, and C conjugates was prepared. This <b>polyvalent</b> <b>conjugate</b> gave {{a positive}} fluorescent antibody (FA) stain with 49 stains of Bacteroides melaninogenicus representing serogroups A, B, and C. When additional strains (92 strains) {{of the three}} subspecies of B. melaninogenicus were examined by the FA stain, with A, B, and C, and <b>polyvalent</b> <b>conjugates,</b> nine strains of B. melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius failed to give a positive stain with any conjugate. Therefore, an FA conjugate was prepared with the antiserum {{to one of these}} strains (532 - 70 A); all nine strains stained positively with this conjugate. These nine strains were biochemically characteristic of B. melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius; thus, these strains were designated as a new serogroup, serogroup C- 1. A new <b>polyvalent</b> <b>conjugate</b> containing serogroups A, B, C, and C- 1 was prepared. This <b>polyvalent</b> <b>conjugate</b> stained positively with 23 representative strains from serogroups A, B, C, and C- 1.

40|$|Background: Regarding risk of {{bacterial}} meningitis (BM) after Cochlear implantation (CI), {{it was suggested}} to receive <b>polyvalent</b> <b>conjugate</b> vaccine. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of BM post CI in child recipients who do not receive polyvalent vaccine. Methods: We enrolled 371 children who had received cochlear implants from 2007 to 2010. None of them received pre or post implantation <b>polyvalent</b> <b>conjugate</b> vaccine for BM. We followed all of them for BM for 2 years after implantation. Results: We detected only one female case of BM (0. 3 % of patients) with the age of 24 months. The mean age of noninfected children was 36. 7 ± 23. 2 months. The education level of parents was "college level or higher" in {{less than half of}} them, and about 65 % of patients were products of consanguineous marriage. Conclusions: Our findings indicated that the incidence of BM was not higher in our cochlear implanted children who did not receive immunization than patients from countries in which routine vaccination is done. We suggest that although proper immunization is recommended before surgery, this procedure could be performed without vaccination, especially in developing countries that face financial problems for preparing vaccines...|$|R
40|$|Injections {{of various}} conjugates of arsanilic acid into newborn guinea pigs {{produced}} a specific tolerance {{in respect to}} subsequent development of hapten-specific delayed hypersensitivity. In general, larger <b>polyvalent</b> <b>conjugates</b> produced longer lasting and more profound suppression of delayed sensitivity than did the smaller ones. Carrier injections alone were ineffective. At lower doses of conjugate, breakthrough of tolerance occurred first with animals immunized with the heterologous carrier conjugate.

40|$|Fluoretec-M is a <b>polyvalent</b> <b>conjugate</b> used {{in direct}} fluorescent-antibody {{staining}} for {{identification of the}} Bacteroides asaccharolyticus-Bacteroides melaninogenicus group. The Fluoretec-M reagent detected all oral and nonoral test strains of B. melaninogaenicus subsp. intermedius, all test strains of B. melaninogenicus subsp. melaninogenicus, and the nonoral strains of B. asaccharolyticus. However, the Fluoretec-M polyvalent reagent and the monovalent conjugates which constitute Fluoretec-M did not detect the oral strains B. asaccharolyticus. The use of Fluoretec-M can therefore generate false-negative results in studies of specimens from oral cavity and from nonoral sites in which an infection with B. asacacharolyticus of oral origin may have taken place. It is suggested that antibodies reactive with the oral antigenic type of B. asaccharolyticus {{be included in the}} preparative procedure of the Fluoretec-M reagent...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) {{almost always}} leads to chronic airway infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Despite advances in antibiotic therapy, after chronic infection rapid deterioration in lung function occurs, increasing morbidity and mortality. Prevention of infection by vaccination is desirable, but earlier trials produced disappointing results. The promising short term immunogenicity {{and safety of}} a new P. aeruginosa vaccine prompted us to evaluate its long term efficacy. We conducted a 10 -year retrospective analysis of outcomes {{in a group of}} vaccinated patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 1989 - 1990, 30 young children with CF, mean age 7 years, with no prior history of infection with P. aeruginosa, were vaccinated against P. aeruginosa with a <b>polyvalent</b> <b>conjugate</b> vaccine. We report the follow-up of 26 of these patients from 1989 to 2001. The patients were given yearly vaccine boosters. Comparisons were made with a CF patient control group matched for gender, age and, where possible, genetic mutation. Vaccinated patients and controls were attending a single CF clinic and received the same clinical management throughout the study period. Main outcomes were time to infection, proportion of patients infected, development of P. aeruginosa mucoid phenotype, lung function and body weight. RESULTS: The time to infection with P. aeruginosa was longer in the vaccination group than in the control group, and fewer vaccinated patients than controls became chronically infected (32 % versus 72 %; P /= 18 years of age {{at the end of the}} study had a lower mean forced expiratory volume at 1 s (FEV 1) than did those 13 - 17 years of age, but this difference was small in the vaccinated group (73. 6 % versus 83. 7 %) compared with the controls (48. 0 % versus 78. 7 %). In the >/= 18 year age category the mean FEV 1 % at 10 years was 73. 6 % (vaccinated) and 48. 0 % (controls) (P < 0. 05). In the vaccinated group only 11 (44 %) of 25 patients were underweight at the 10 -year follow-up compared with 18 (72 %) of 25 at the beginning of the study. In the control group 17 (68 %) of 25 patients were underweight at 10 -year follow-up compared with 16 (64 %) of 25 at the beginning of the study. CONCLUSION: Regular vaccination of young CF patients for a period of 10 years with a <b>polyvalent</b> <b>conjugate</b> vaccine reduced the frequency of chronic infection with P. aeruginosa. This was associated with better preservation of lung function. Vaccinated patients gained more weight during the study period, a possible indication of an improved overall health status...|$|R
40|$|Since {{implementation}} of the 13 -valent <b>polyvalent</b> <b>conjugate</b> vaccine (PCV 13) in Canada during 2010, the proportion of PCV 13 serotypes causing invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) has declined from 55 % (n = 1492) in 2010 to 31 % (n = 764) in 2014. A concurrent increase of non-PCV 13 serotypes has occurred and 22 F {{has become the most}} prevalent serotype in Canada increasing from 7 % (n = 183) to 11 % (n = 283). Core single nucleotide variant phylogenetic analysis was performed on 137 Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 22 F isolates collected across Canada from 2005 - 2015. Six phylogenetic lineages (n = 117) were identified among a serotype 22 F/ST 433 clonal complex (CC), including a recently expanding erythromycin-resistant clone. Erythromycin-resistance was observed in 25 isolates possessing ermB, mef or a 23 S rRNA A 2061 G point mutation; 2 penicillin-resistant isolates had recombinant pbp 1 a, pbp 2 a and/or pbp 2 x; 3 tetracycline-resistant isolates contained tetM; and 1 isolate was multidrug-resistant. Virulence factor analysis indicated a high level of homogeneity among the 22 F/ST 433 clonal complex strains. A group of 6 phylogenetic outlier strains had differing MLST, antimicrobial resistance and molecular profiles suggestive of capsule switching events. While capsule switch events among S. pneumoniae serotype 22 F has been observed, increasing prevalence of S. pneumoniae serotype 22 F can be attributed to an evolving homogenous clone expanding nationally through local transmission events...|$|R

In the first procedure, involving immunoprecipitation, rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL- 2 H 3), surface labeled by 125 I were reacted with a <b>polyvalent</b> <b>conjugate</b> of DSCG and bovine serum albumin and then subjected to solubilization by the non-ionic detergent Nonidet P- 40 (NP- 40). From these lysates, precipitation was specifically attained by subsequent addition of rabbit anti-DSCG antibodies. In an SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), a single radioactive band was observed, having an apparent mol. wt. of 60 000 daltons. Competitive inhibition of the immunoprecipitation {{in the presence of}} free drug or excess of EDTA demonstrated the specificity of the isolation. Furthermore, this particular membrane component could not be isolated from several other cell types examined. The second isolation from several other cell types examined. The second isolation procedure employed affinity chromatography on DSCG immobilized on polyacryl- hydrazido agarose beads. The DSCG-binding protein was eluted from the affinity column with either DSCG or with EDTA and also migrated on SDS-PAGE as a single band of 60 000 mol. wt., similar to that obtained by the immunoprecipitation procedure. These and other results suggest that this newly isolated protein is the one responsible for the Ca 2 +-dependent binding of the drug to the basophil membrane...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{degree of}} {{substitution}} and valency of bioconjugate reaction products are often poorly judged or require multiple time- and product-consuming chemical characterization methods. These aspects become critical when analyzing and optimizing {{the potency of}} costly <b>polyvalent</b> bioactive <b>conjugates.</b> In this study, size-exclusion chromatography with multiangle laser light scattering was paired with refractive index detection and ultraviolet spectroscopy (SEC-MALS-RI-UV) to characterize the reaction efficiency, degree of substitution, and valency of the products of conjugation of either peptides or proteins to a biopolymer scaffold, i. e., hyaluronic acid (HyA). Molecular characterization was more complete compared to estimates from a protein quantification assay, and exploitation of this method led to more accurate deduction of the molecular structures of polymer bioconjugates. Information obtained using this technique can improve macro-molecular engineering design principles and help to better understand multivalent macromolecular interactions in biological systems...|$|R

40|$|Membrane lytic {{peptides}} are a novel {{class of}} anticancer agents {{which have the}} potential to overcome drug resistance. We aim to improve the selectivity, potency and pharmacokinetic profile of membrane lytic peptides in anticancer treatment and explore the underlying mechanism in this work. The first part is focused on selectivity mediated by tumor-associated protease. An 18 residue membrane lytic peptide was cyclized with a linker cleavable by tumor overexpressed MT 1 -MMP. The activity of peptide was suppressed upon cyclization and could be recovered upon enzymatic digestion. And MT 1 -MMP-positive cells were preferentially killed by the peptide. In the second part, we tried to improve the pharmacokinetic performance of lytic peptide with the strategy of polyvalency and polymeric therapeutics. A short amphipathic sequence (KW) 3 was conjugated to dextran in multiple copies to afford a <b>polyvalent</b> <b>conjugate</b> Dex-(KW) 3. The conjugate exhibited 500 -fold potency enhancement compared to monomeric (KW) 3 in MTT assay. No hemolytic activity was detected. Thermodynamic study revealed stronger membrane binding and deeper membrane penetration of Dex-(KW) 3, which were attributed to the high local concentration of peptides on a nano-sized carrier. We further investigated the mechanism of how the conjugate affects cancer cells in the third part of this work. The membrane integrity and metabolic activity of cells were examined at different concentrations of conjugate. Membrane damage occurred at high concentration range. The decrease of metabolic activity began at low concentration when the plasma membrane was still intact. A dual-function mechanism was proposed and proven with a polyelectrolyte complex between Dex-(KW) 3 and poly-γ-glutamic acid (PGA). The complexation neutralized the positive charge of Dex-(KW) 3 and efficiently suppressed the plasma membrane lysing activity. But it did not change the intracellular activity of conjugate, namely decreasing the cell metabolic activity and mitochondrial membrane potential. We hypothesized the complex Dex-(KW) 3 /PGA was internalized and dissociate in the acidic environment of endosome. And it was supported by thermodynamic study, in which weaker binding between conjugate and PGA at pH 5. 5 than at pH 7. 4 was found. The complexation inhibited the effect on plasma membrane while maintained the intracellular activity. The strategy separates one effect from the other thus allows better understanding and control of the novel conjugate...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} 10 years, {{polyvalent}} DNA-gold nanoparticle (DNA-GNP) conjugate {{has been demonstrated}} as an efficient, universal nanocarrier for drug and gene delivery with high uptake by over 50 different types of primary and cancer cell lines.

Herein we show that terminal PEGylation of the complementary DNA strand hybridized to a <b>polyvalent</b> DNA-GNP <b>conjugate</b> can eliminate non-specific adsorption of serum proteins and greatly increases its resistance against DNase I based degradation. The PEGylated DNA-GNP conjugate still retains high cell uptake property, making it an attractive intracellular delivery nanocarrier for DNA binding reagents.

40|$|SummaryThis paper {{reviews the}} {{epidemiological}} data describing meningococcal {{disease in the}} Middle East and North Africa (MENA). While meningococcal disease remains an important cause of endemic and epidemic disease in many MENA countries, existing published epidemiological data appear limited, fragmented, and collected via disparate methodologies. Children aged 5 years and younger are predominantly affected, though outbreaks of the disease often affect older age groups. Whilst serogroup A remains a main cause of meningococcal disease in the region, cases of serogroup B, W- 135, and Y have been increasingly reported {{over the last two}} decades in some countries. The Hajj pilgrimage is a key factor influencing outbreaks and transmission, and the use of vaccines has minimized the effects on the home countries of the pilgrims and has decreased global dissemination of disease. Wider use of available <b>polyvalent</b> meningococcal <b>conjugate</b> vaccines may provide broader protection against the range of serogroups causing disease or posing a threat in the region. In addition, strengthening regional surveillance systems and regularly publishing reports with reliable estimates of disease incidence, carriage, disease-related mortality, and sequelae may facilitate the development of appropriate interventions and public health strategies regarding meningococcal disease within the region...|$|R

The induction of anti-TM antibodies belonging to the IgE and other immunoglobulin classes was specifically suppressed by the administration of tolerogenic conjugates prepared by coupling trimellitic anhydride (TMA) to the hydrophilic non-immunogenic polymer, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), prior to immunization with TM-OA conjugates. More importantly, established anti-TM responses were also suppressed by these TM-PVA conjugates. By contrast, however, treatment with TM-PVA conjugates did not affect either the primary or the established anti-OA antibody response. The tolerogenic effects of the PVA conjugates were dose-dependent and appeared also {{to be dependent on}} the epitope density. Treatment with these conjugates also prevented immunized mice from showing any symptoms of systemic anaphylaxis on challenge with <b>polyvalent</b> TM-protein <b>conjugates.</b> These findings indicate that these conjugates may have the potential of useful therapeutic agents for the treatment of TMA-induced pulmonary hypersensitivity diseases...|$|R
40|$|N-Acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc) is a sialic acid which {{constitutes}} terminal {{positions in}} glycoproteins and glycolipids. It {{is part of}} the antigenic determinant of many forms of cancer (S. Hakomori, Chem. Phys. Lipids. 42, 209 (1986)) and hence a cancer "vaccine" could be made from an appropriate multivalent macromolecular form of NeuAc. To explore the possibility of inducing anti-NeuAc antibodies, we have synthesized <b>polyvalent</b> <b>conjugates</b> of αNeuAc or NeuAcα 2 - 3 Galβ 1 - 4 Glc (sialyl 2 - 3 lactose) on protein carriers. This was accomplished by reductive amination with 2 -oxoethyl α-NeuAc or with the concealed aldehyde of the reducing sugar (glucose) onto the lysine residues of the proteins Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and Tetanus Toxoid (TT). A new procedure involving a Michael-type addition employed the ϵ-amino groups of the lysine residues in a 1, 4 nucleophilic addition to the acrylamide functional group in two derivatives of NeuAc; the N-acryloylaminoethylthiopropyl glycoside, and the N-acryloylsialyl 2 - 3 lactosylamine. This technique does not require the use of reagents and was performed under mild basic conditions. Polyacrylamide copolymers were also synthesized by radical co-polymerization of acrylamide with NeuAc monomers, providing a polymer (Mw ≈ 100 kDa) with pendant NeuAc. Reactive monomers giving different spacer arms between the sugar and the polymer backbone were developed, including the allyl glycoside, a more reactive N-acryloylaminoethylthiopropyl glycoside and several lactose derivatives. The polymers were found to have a better shelf life than the proteins, and had the advantage of sharing only the NeuAc moiety. Some of the NeuAc/protein conjugates were used to immunize rabbits, and the antibodies formed were screened with polyacrylamide copolymers with pendant NeuAc. The polymer with spacer was found to react better with the antibodies in immunoprecipitation and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Inhibition of ELISA experiments were done using synthesized derivatives of NeuAc to determine the binding specificity of the antibodies. It was found that the antibodies recognized the glycerol side chain, acid function, spacer, and to a lesser extent, the acetamido function of NeuAc. The same methodology was used to map the binding site of the lectin from Triticum vulgaris (called Wheat germ agglutinin, WGA) which binds NeuAc. Nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) studies were undertaken to determine the acidity constants (pK a) and conformation of several NeuAc derivatives. Also studied was the lactone of NeuAcα 2 - 3 Galβ 1 - 4 Glc which is believed to be responsible for the immunogenicity of certain cancer cells (T. Dohi, G. Nores and S.

40|$|The anti-β-D-galactosidase {{activating}} antibody {{response in}} lymph node fragment cultures {{was investigated in}} an attempt to understand the mechanism determining the magnitude of an immune response towards a natural hapten, which occurs only once in each antigen molecule, under in vitro conditions that preserve the histology of the responding tissue. Fragments were individually challenged for defined time periods, and washed; cultures with one and two fragments were then set up. Co-cultivation of fragments produced titres higher than predicted from results in single fragment cultures. This happened even when the latter cultures produced low titres because of excessive antigen dosages. Co-cultivation of fragments also improved the duration of the antibody response. These effects appeared to correlate with the number of memory cells present in the fragments {{at the beginning of the}} cultures. These observations, together with data obtained by manipulating different doses and times of antigen exposure suggest that collaboration between cells and determinants with different specificities may occur, not only in the initial induction, but also in the sequential stimulation of antibody-forming clones. It is postulated that the co-operative mechanism shown to act in the initiation of the antibody response by cell suspensions toward <b>polyvalent</b> artificial <b>conjugates</b> may also operate when intact lymphoid tissue is reached by a single bacterial determinant in its natural molecular configuratio...|$|R
40|$|La técnica de elección para el {{screening}} de anticuerpos antinucleares (ANA) es la inmunofluorescencia indirecta que utiliza como sustrato una línea de células epiteliales de carcinoma de laringe humano (IFI-HEp 2), y como antisuero, anti-IgG o anti-Ig totales. Los ANA-IgG son los más importantes para el diagnóstico y monitoreo de las enfermedades del tejido conectivo (ETC), mientras los ANA-IgM son de menor relevancia clínica en estos pacientes. Sin embargo, poco se sabe de los ANA-IgA ya que estos Ac han sido menos investigados. El objetivo de este trabajo fue estudiar la prevalencia de los diferentes isotipos de inmunoglobulinas de anticuerpos antinucleares en los pacientes con ETC y evaluar la conveniencia de utilizar conjugados monovalentes o polivalentes. Se procesaron 100 sueros de pacientes con diversas ETC empleando IFI-HEp 2, en los cuales se detectó 38 % de ANA-IgA (títulos &# 8805; 1 : 80) y 12 % de ANA-IgM (títulos &# 8804; 1 : 160). En 29 casos se detectó IgA en ausencia de IgM, en 3 casos IgM en ausencia de IgA. En todos los casos los ANA-IgG estuvieron presentes. En 6 sueros se observó un cambio de imagen con conjugado anti-IgA y en 3 con conjugado anti-IgM. Debido a la alta prevalencia de ANA-IgA detectada por IFI-HEp 2, se destaca la conveniencia de utilizar conjugado anti-Ig totales en lugar de anti-IgG, mientras se desconozca la relevancia de los ANA-IgA en el diagnóstico, pronóstico y seguimiento de las enfermedades reumáticas sistémicas. The indirect immunofluorescence with epitelial {{cell line}} from human laryngeal carcinoma as substrate (IIF-HEp 2) and anti-IgG or anti-total Ig as antisera, is the technique currently {{used for the}} detection of antinuclear antibodies. The most important antibodies for the diagnosis and follow-up of connective tissue diseases (CTD) are the IgG-ANA, while the IgM-ANA have no clinical relevance. However the IgA-ANA have not been thoroughly investigated so far. The aim of this work was to study the prevalence of different ANA isotypes of Ig antibodies in CTD patients and to evaluate the convenience of the use of monovalent or <b>polyvalent</b> <b>conjugate.</b> We examined the sera of 100 patients with different CTD by IIF-HEp 2 and detected a prevalence of 38 % IgA-ANA (titles &# 8805; 1 : 80) and 12 % IgM-ANA (titles &# 8804; 1 : 160). In twenty nine cases we detected IgA-ANA in absence of IgM-ANA, and in 3 cases IgM-ANA in absence of IgA-ANA. In all the cases IgG-ANA were present. In 6 sera a change in the immunofluorescence pattern was observed while using anti-IgA conjugate, whereas in 3 the change was observed with the use of anti-IgM conjugate. Because of the high prevalence of ANA-IgA detected by IIF-HEp 2, we emphasize the convenience of employing anti-total Ig in spite of anti-IgG conjugated until the role of ANA-IgA is dilucidated in CTD patients, in order to establish its relevance in the diagnosis, prognosis and follow-up of systemic rheumatic diseases...|$|R

By an in vitro kinase assay: (i) Unaggregated and disaggregated receptors {{are associated with a}} kinase that phosphorylates an exogenous (peptide) substrate but minimally, or not at all, the subunits of Fc epsilon RI or associated proteins (endogenous substrates). After aggregation, phosphorylation of the exogenous substrate is linear with time, but the modification of the endogenous substrates reaches a plateau, presumably because only those endogenous substrates that are adjacent to the kinase are phosphorylated. (ii) Aggregated receptors and disaggregated receptors have enhanced kinase activity toward exogenous substrate. The state of phosphorylation of the receptor correlates strongly with the yield of enhanced kinase activity. We propose that upon aggregation of Fc epsilon RI, a constitutively associated kinase phosphorylates endogenous substrates by transphosphorylation. As a result, additional kinase activity becomes manifest and this promotes further transphosphorylation. In view of the homology between Fc epsilon RI and other receptors central to the immune response, the latter receptors likely utilize a similar transphosphorylation mechanism...|$|R

The soluble antigen fluorescent antibody test is basically an indirect fluorescent antibody test except that an artificial matrix of cellulose acetate discs is used as a substrate for antigen and the test results are scanned and recorded by a fluorometer. THe influenza type A soluble antigen fluorescent antibody was obtained from concentrated and detergent disrupted virus particles, absorbed onto cellulose acetate discs. Anti-influenza sera were prepared in pheasants and ducks to A/turkey/Ontario/ 6118 / 67 and in pigeons to A/turkey/Ontario/ 6213 / 68. The antigen-antibody complex was detected by specific staining with monovalent or <b>polyvalent</b> fluorescein isothiocyanate <b>conjugated</b> rabbit anti-avian immunoglobulins. The soluble antigen fluorescent antibody test is a sensitive technique for the detection of specific influenza A antibodies in several avian species, and could be adapted for use in large scale surveys...|$|R
40|$|Cell surface carbohydrate-binding-proteins (also {{known as}} lectins) {{recognize}} pathogen (e. g. including viruses, bacteria and fungi) surface carbohydrates to regulate host immune responses, however but, the such interactions are also often exploited by pathogens to enhance for infection. Because of the intrinsically weak nature of protein-carbohydrate interactions, multivalent bindings are typically invloved. The spatial orientation of carbohydrate-recognition-domains (CRDs) in multimeric lectins plays a centralvery {{important role in}} governing their binding high affinity and specificity recognition. Such information is also key for designing potent, multivalent inhibitors, but is difficult to obtain {{in the absence of}} valid lectin crystal structures. In this chapter, we describe a method to a of controlled display of ingpolyvalent mulitple carbohydrates onto fluorescent quantum dots (QDs) surface to probe how they match the CRDs presentation by measuring Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) efficiency between the QD and fluorescent dye-labelled lectins. A highly efficient ligand-exchange method has been developed here allows to construct compact, <b>polyvalent</b> QD-mannose <b>conjugates</b> (QD-Man) with high copies of mannose which are essential for sensitive FRET application readout and effective valency tuning. A rRapid, sensitive and ratiomeric FRET readout has been used to quantify their binding affinity and specicity, which in combination with QD-Man’s geometry, quantifies the interactions allows us to derive the CRD`s spatial orientation. A good correlation of between QD-Man’s nose specifically binding to recombinatly expressed lectins in solution and with its effective inhibition of cell surface native lectin mediated virus cell entry proves validates QD-FRET being a reliable technique to study multivalent receptor-ligands recognition mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|The {{necessity}} {{of developing a}} quick, sensitive, and reliable test for Salmonella in nonfat dry milk (NDM) {{is evident from the}} recent tracing of Salmonella outbreaks to this product. Normally, coagulation of casein occurs when assaying NDM under regular cultural conditions, raising the possibility of trapped bacteria. After 20 hr of incubation of NDM in preenrichment lactose broth, enrichment was achieved by using Selenite-Cystine Broth. Smears from the enrichment broth were examined by the fluorescent-antibody technique (FAT) with a commercially available <b>polyvalent</b> O globulin <b>conjugated</b> with fluorescein. Standard cultural methods (SCM) were performed for comparison with FAT. Sensitivity of FAT was definitely improved by the use of trypsin. Casein coagulation of NDM can be avoided by addition of trypsin to samples during initial preenrichment in lactose broth. Samples containing approximately one Salmonella per 10 g were easily detected by FAT with the use of trypsin-treated samples. The method required only 42 hr to complete. Additionally, the use of trypsin enhanced recovery of Salmonella by use of SCM, as evidenced by alteration in the observed coliform to Salmonella ratios...|$|R

To access the final edited and published work see [URL] last 16 years have witnessed the landmark development of polyvalent thiolated DNA-functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNP's) possessing striking properties within the emerging field of nanobiotechnology. Many novel properties of this hybrid nanomaterial are attributed to the dense DNA shell. However, {{the question of whether}} nonthiolated polyvalent DNA–AuNP could be fabricated with a high DNA density and properties similar to those of its thiolated counterpart has not been explored in detail. Herein, we report that by simply tuning the pH of the DNA–AuNP mixture an ultrahigh capacity of nonthiolated DNA can be conjugated to AuNP's in a few minutes, resulting in <b>polyvalent</b> DNA–AuNP <b>conjugates</b> with cooperative melting behavior, a typical property of polyvalent thiolated DNA-functionalized AuNP's. With this method, large AuNP's (e. g., 50 nm) can be functionalized to achieve the colorimetric detection of sub-nanometer DNA. Furthermore, this fast, stable DNA loading was employed to separate AuNP's of different sizes. We propose that a large fraction of the attached DNAs are adsorbed via one or a few terminal bases to afford the high loading capacity and the ability to hybridize with the complementary DNA. This discovery not only offers a time- and cost-effective way to functionalize AuNP's with a high density of nonthiolated DNA but also provides new insights into the fundamental understanding of how DNA strands with different sequences interact with AuNP's.
