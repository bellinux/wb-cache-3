Addition of surfactants is desirable as it allows keeping intact the intrinsic properties of the CNTs. However, for different applications, the potential toxicity of the surfactant is an important issue. Polysaccharides {{are among the best}} candidates and chemical modification can improve their intrinsic features. They can thus combine the properties of added synthetic counterparts with their intrinsic biocompatibility. In this work, we focused on the synthesis of hydrophobically modified Xanthan (Xan) with three derivatives (Diphenylmaleic <b>anhydride,</b> <b>Phtalic</b> <b>anhydride,</b> Epichlorhydrin-Phenol) to disperse CNTs. The dispersion and the stability against sedimentation of double walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) have been investigated (rheological properties, zeta potential) as a function of pH and Xan concentration. Our results show that stable suspension of DWCNTs for 0. 5 % (w/w) could be obtained with the three derivatives of modified Xanthan gum in acidic and alkaline media while Xan itself is a very poor dispersing agent for CNTs, giving good evidence of the validity of our approach...|$|R

Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) emitted from materials and consumer products can affect indoor air quality (IAQ) in terms of odor annoyance and other adverse effects on human health. Hence, the main purpose of the present paper was to recognize the odor active VOCs emitted by a specific consumer product and responsible of the odor annoyance perceived, performing head-space experiments followed by GC/MS-O analysis both at ambient temperature and during heating (condition of use). Ten odor active VOCs belonging to different chemical classes were detected; Aromatic Hydrocarbons (Benzene, Toluene, m/p-Xilene), Phenols (Phenol), Aldehydes (Benzaldehyde, Nonanale), Chlorinated Aromatic Hydrocarbons (Chlorobenzene, 1, 4 -Dichlorobenzene), Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (Naphtalene) and <b>Anhydrides</b> (<b>Phtalic</b> <b>Anhydride).</b> Naphthalene was recognized as the organic compound that mainly contributed to the overall odor perceived. Moreover, it was observed that the product’s heating resulted in an increasing of VOCs emission and in odor perception.

This highly exothermic reaction proceeds according to a parallel-consecutive scheme. The study of reaction kinetics showed that the reaction rate expressions based on the oxido-reduction mechanism {{could be used to}} describe the benzene conversion and maleic anhydride yield. A fluidized bed reactor model using bubble assemblage concepts combined with the reaction rate expressions gave accurate predictions of the benzene conversion and maleic anhydride yield {{for a wide range of}} temperature, feed rate, inlet benzene concentration, and catalyst mass. A phenomenological model of the dynamic behaviour based on the steady-state model was formulated and validated with experimental data. The model predicted accurately the responses of temperature and product concentrations.

40|$|The {{materials}} and methods used for the preparation of interpenetrated polymer network (IPN) by UV curing processes are reported. In particular, recent developments on the formation and characterization of some sequential IPN based on mixtures of commercially available diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A (DGEBA) epoxy resins and UV curable epoxy-dimethacrylate resins are discussed. Finally, the photopolymerization kinetic behavior and thermal properties of some UV curable mixtures based on the modified epoxy-dimethacrylate resins for the preparation and characterization of a grafted sequential IPN are described. Interpenetrated Polymer Networks (IPN) are often used to describe a combination {{of at least two}} polymers forming two distinct networks, where at least one polymer is polymerized or crosslinked in the immediate presence of the other. In an IPN, each polymer is crosslinked to itself, but not to the other, so two polymer networks are interpenetrated each to other. These highly crosslinked polymer materials can be achieved by using thermosetting multifunctional oligomers, such as epoxy, polyurethanic and acrylic commercially available resins. Recently, our contribution in this research field has exploited the second approach in which a commercially available diglycidyl ether of dimethacrylate bisphenol-A (DGEBA) epoxy resin (commonly called vinylester or epoxy-dimethacrylate resin: EPDMA) were modified with <b>phtalic</b> <b>anhydride</b> to prepare a grafted seq-IPN. A ring opening reaction of PA anhydride was promoted by hydroxyl groups on EPDMA chains by using 4 - dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as catalyst. The modified EPDMA resins provides a novel approach for preparing grafted seq-IPN by using commercially available DGEBA epoxy and modified EPDMA resins. The obtained results suggest that the modified EPDMA resins can represent a convenient method to reduce the phase separation after curing providing a fine control of the final mechanical and optical properties. Besides, the temperature for the thermal curing in a grafted seq-IPN can be conveniently lowered at 90 °C. Finally, the preparation of grafted-seq-IPN can be easily obtained by firstly UV curing of methacrylate groups in modified EPDMA resins and then applying a thermal treatment to crosslink epoxy groups in a temperature range between 90 ° and 105 °C. This curing sequence allows reaching quite high Tg values and good conversion degrees both for UV and thermal curing treatments...|$|R

40|$|Development of {{selective}} oxidation catalysts {{is a major}} concern of modern chemical industry. Among several systems, VTi-oxide based catalysts showed the most promising and versatile, able to catalyse key reactions like oxidation of o-xylene to <b>phtalic</b> <b>anhydride</b> and the abatement of NOx for pollution control. Extensive investigation in the past decades concluded that supported vanadia is present as a layer of molecularly-defined surface compounds VxOy, ("monolayer species") on top of the carrier oxide which are the catalytically active sites. Despite all the efforts to correlate the activity of VTi-oxide with its structure, the catalytic role of the different active species in the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons and how to tune their properties are still open questions. The goal of the present thesis is the in situ characterisation of V/Ti-oxide by transient-response chemical (feed step-response, temperature-programmed analyses) and spectroscopic (infrared and Raman) techniques to answer these important questions by using toluene partial oxidation as test reaction. First, the identification and elucidation {{of the role of the}} vanadia species was carried out, using Raman spectroscopy and activity tests. The strongly-bound monolayer species which cannot be dissolved by acid treatment were found to have isolated vanadate structure and be catalytically active in toluene partial oxidation. They have redox properties close to more condensed vanadate ("polymeric") species, which are also active. Vanadium present as crystalline V 2 O 5 is not directly active, but plays a role in the surface reduction mechanism. By in situ DRIFTS, it has been shown that V/Ti-oxide active sites work with a coupled mechanism of product desorption and site reoxidation. Re-oxidation can occur either by reaction with gas-phase O 2 or by oxygen spillover from bulk V 2 O 5. Acidity associated with V-O-V bridges in monolayer species is likely responsible for the reversible deactivation of the catalysts caused by strongly held surface coke. Second, the modification of the acid/base catalyst properties by K addition and the formation of surface V oxide species were studied. The presence of K modifies the molecular structure of the vanadia surface species and forms new K-containing ones. These species are difficult to reduce in hydrogen and they are not catalytically active. Their presence causes a diminished catalytic activity. At the same time, Lewis and Brønsted acidity is depressed. This eliminates the phenomenon of deactivation. The excessive basicity caused by potassium addition has a detrimental effect on selectivity in benzoic acid, which is strongly held on the surface because of their intrinsic acidity and undergoes overoxidation to CO 2. Finally, the VTi-oxide was supported on structured supports based on woven fibreglass. The use of structured beds is interesting in chemical engineering due to their advantages in terms of increased mass and heat trasfer, reduced pressure drop and optimal flow distribution. In order to reach optimum performance, the rather inert silica surface must be modified by adding an alumina layer on top of the fibres. This modification is essential for an optimal support because of insufficient dispersion of the titania layer on silica due to phase repulsion between the two oxides. The structured catalysts possess comparable activity and identical selectivity to the studied non-structured VTi-oxide catalyst with the same content of vanadia layers...|$|R

40|$|Many {{reactions}} {{carried out}} in the chemical industry are exothermic. The heat liberated by the reaction is often transferred to another medium such as steam by heat exchange. This heat can then be used elsewhere or be used to generate power via a steam cycle. In this work the focus is on another method of reaction heat recovery. When an exothermic reaction is conducted at elevated pressures, a turbine expander can be placed directly behind the reactor. The hot, high-pressure product gas from the reactor can then be expanded in the turbine. During the expansion process the physical energy of the product gas is converted to kinetic energy (or electricity if the turbine is connected to a generator). Three chemical processes were studied to determine the feasibility of turbine integration into the processes. They are ethylene oxide <b>production,</b> phthalic <b>anhydride</b> <b>production</b> and the hydrodealkylation of alkylaromatic compounds. The chosen processes differ in terms of reactor operation, reactant conversion as well as {{the presence or absence of}} recycle loops. Simulation models were developed for the mentioned processes with the process simulator Aspen Plus®. Results from the simulations show that, without the turbine, the processes require power from external sources. They can however operate independently from external power sources when a turbine is present. Excess power can be exported or used for electricity generation. It is therefore feasible• to incorporate turbine expansion units in all the processes considered. The operating conditions of some unit operations have to be changed to accommodate the turbine expander. With the additional product namely power, a re-evaluation of all the operating conditions and tradeoffs in the process is necessary. Further investigation into the impact of turbine integration on the optimal operating conditions of the process is therefore recommended. Traditional definitions used to evaluate the performance of a process generating or consuming power, were found to be inadequate for use in processes where power and chemicals are produced together. New performance parameters are required for the evaluation of processes where power and chemicals are produced simultaneously. An exergy analysis was performed for one of the cases. This analysis method provides insight as to where thermodynamic losses occur in a process. The exergy analysis was useful to quantify the losses occurring in an isenthalpic expansion valve, and the savings obtained by replacing such a valve with an expansion turbine.

This work addresses the optimization of SC planning and design considering economical and environmental issues. The strategic decisions considered in the model are facility location, processing technology selection and production–distribution planning. A life cycle assessment (LCA) approach is envisaged to incorporate the environmental aspects of the model. IMPACT 2002 + methodology is selected to perform the impact assessment within the SC thus providing a feasible implementation of a combined midpoint–endpoint evaluation. The proposed approach reduces the value-subjectivity inherent to the assignment of weights in the calculation of an overall environmental impact by considering endpoint damage categories as objective function. Additionally, the model performs an impact mapping along the comprising SC nodes and activities. Such mapping allows to focus financial efforts to reduce environmental burdens to the most promising subjects. Furthermore, consideration of CO 2 trading scheme and temporal distribution of environmental interventions are also included {{with the intention of}} providing a tool that may be utilized to evaluate current regulatory policies or pursue more effective ones.
