5|$|Mallards {{are one of}} {{the most}} common {{varieties}} of ducks hunted as a sport. The ideal location for hunting mallards is considered to be where the water level is somewhat shallow.

In certain countries, the mallard may be legally shot but is protected under national acts and policies. For example, in the United Kingdom, the mallard is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which restricts certain hunting methods or taking or killing mallards.|$|E

5|$|Although Brabham bought Cosworth DFV engines for the 1969 season, Rindt left to join Lotus.

5|$|Ecclestone held BMW {{to their}} {{contract}} for the 1987 season, but the German company would only supply the laydown engine. The upright units, around which Brabham had designed their new car, were sold {{for use by the}} Arrows team. Senior figures at Brabham, including Murray, have admitted that by this stage Ecclestone had lost interest in running the team. The 1987 season was only slightly more successful than the previous year—Patrese and de Cesaris scoring 10 points between them, including two third <b>places</b> <b>at</b> the Belgian Grand Prix and the Mexican Grand Prix. Unable to locate a suitable engine supplier, the team missed the FIA deadline for entry into the 1988 world championship and Ecclestone finally announced the team's withdrawal from Formula One at the Brazilian Grand Prix in April 1988. During the season ending Australian Grand Prix, Ecclestone announced he had sold MRD to EuroBrun team owner Walter Brun for an unknown price.|$|E
5|$|Fermi {{became the}} Charles H.

The short distance between Chicago and Argonne allowed Fermi to work at both <b>places.</b> <b>At</b> Argonne he continued experimental physics, investigating neutron scattering with Leona Marshall.
