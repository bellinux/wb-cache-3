50|$|In 1992, Leyland DAF Ltd, an English {{member of}} the Dutch group DAF Trucks, granted to Stichting Ofasec a {{mortgage}} debenture to secure a loan, containing a floating charge. In 1993, the DAF group collapsed, and Ofasec appointed administrative receivers, which crystallised the floating charge into a fixed charge. The receivers realised the assets, paid <b>preferential</b> <b>debts,</b> and made interim distributions to Ofasec. £72m remained. In the Netherlands, litigation was ongoing meaning this sum could have been insufficient to meet {{the claims of the}} debenture holder. In 1996, Leyland DAF Ltd entered voluntary liquidation. The liquidator’s costs exceeded the amount realised, but they applied for a declaration that their expenses and pay should come out of the proceeds of the realisation of the assets of Leyland DAF Ltd including those subject to a floating charge.|$|R
5000|$|Hoffmann J {{held that}} in reality, the charge on book debts was a {{floating}} charge, but had crystallised a week before, and so took priority over other debts. Following Re Manurewa Transport Ltd crystallisation clauses were a necessary incident of parties’ {{freedom to contract}} and policy objections should {{be dealt with by}} Parliament. He noted various statutory already, including priority to <b>preferential</b> <b>debts.</b> And certainly he at first instance was not going add to the list. It followed that there was a floating charge if a company can continue to use book debts without the consent of the chargee. He added that although clause 3(A)(ii)(a) referred to a ‘first specific charge’ over book debts and others, ‘the rights over the debts created by the debenture were in my judgment such as to be categorised in law as a floating charge.' ...|$|R
25|$|The {{basic duty}} of the {{receiver}} was to realise value for the floating charge holder, although all <b>preferential</b> <b>debts,</b> or those with priority, {{would have to be}} paid. For other unsecured creditors, the possibility of recovering money was remote. The floating owed no duty to other creditors with regard to the timing of the appointment of a receiver, even if it could have an effect on negotiations for refinancing the business. It was accepted that a receiver had a duty to act only for the proper purpose of realising debts, and not for some ulterior motive. In Downsview Nominees Ltd v First City Corp Ltd, a company had given floating charges to two banks (Westpac first, and First City Corp second). The directors, wishing to install a friendly figure in control asked Westpac to assign its floating charge to their friend Mr Russell, who proceeded to run the business with further losses of $500,000, and refused to pass control to First City Corp, even though they offered the company discharge of all the money owed under the first debenture. The Privy Council advised that Mr Russell, as administrative receiver, had acted for an improper purpose by refusing this deal. A further case of breach of duty occurred in Medforth v Blake where the administrative receiver of a pig farm ignored the former owner's advice on how to get discounts on pig food of £1000 a week. As a result, larger debts were run up. Sir Richard Scott VC held this was a breach of an equitable duty of exercising due diligence. However, a more general duty to creditors was tightly constrained, and general liability for professional negligence was denied to exist. In Silven Properties Ltd v Royal Bank of Scotland a receiver of a property business failed to apply for planning permission on houses that could have significantly raised their value, and did not find tenants for the vacant properties, before selling them. It was alleged that the sales were at an undervalue, but the Court of Appeal held that the receiver's power of sale was exercisable without incurring any undue expense. Everything was subordinate to the duty to the receiver to realise a good price. In this respect, an administrator is not capable of disregarding other creditors, at least in law. One {{of the reasons for the}} partial abolition of administrative receivership was that after the receiver had performed his task of realising assets for the floating charge holder, very little value was left in the company for other creditors because it appeared to have fewer incentives to efficiently balance all creditors' interests. Ordinarily, once the receiver's work was done, the company would go into liquidation.|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedThis study {{addresses}} how {{political connections}} influence a firm’s access to bond capital using {{a database of}} 1672 new bond issuances in China from 2001 to 2009. In this context, firm political connections are measured using a score based on the highest bureaucratic position held by a firm executive, with {{the highest level of}} political connections attributed to those who have held top positions in the central government, an intermediate level attributed to those in provincial and municipal governments, and the lowest level attributed to those who have not held any government position. Results suggest that firm political connections are positively associated with debt offering amounts and issuer credit ratings, but only in the subsample of firms that have poor information environments, such as non-publicly listed firms and non-Beijing headquartered firms, thus lending support to the argument that political connections contribute to firm reputation. The role of political connections in providing <b>preferential</b> access to <b>debt</b> is relevant to both state-owned enterprises and privately held firms. In addition, issuing firm political connections and bank underwriter political connections serve as alternative mechanisms when explaining the variation of offering amounts and issuer credit rating...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper defines “interdependence ” as high {{correlations}} across markets {{during all}} {{states of the}} world and “contagion ” as the spillovers from extreme negative events. Interdependence has increased dramatically over time, especially within the euro area, even after controlling for global shocks and changes in volatility. Not surprisingly, negative events in one country also quickly affect others. Regression analysis shows that a country is more vulnerable to contagion if it has a more levered banking system, greater trade exposure, weaker macroeconomic fundamentals, and larger international portfolio investment liabilities. Countries are less vulnerable, however, if they have larger international financial portfolio investment assets (which can provide a buffer against shocks) and are less reliant on debt (versus equity) for international financing. The analysis has a number of implications for evaluating policies aimed at mitigating contagion. Instead of limiting integration through trade and financial flows, countries should focus on reducing leverage in their domestic banking systems, strengthening macroeconomic fundamentals, balancing investment liabilities with international assets, and avoiding <b>preferential</b> treatment for <b>debt</b> financing. Countries that face imminent risks of contagion should evaluate additional policies based on whether they can permanently thwart a channel for contagion versus simply delay an inevitable adjustment.

40|$|Abstract: In the 1950 s and 60 s, Alexander Gerschenkron {{claimed that}} banks {{facilitate}} economic growth among “backward ” countries. In 1990 s and 2000 s, many theorists similarly claim that banks promote growth. Banks {{do so by}} their superior monitoring and screening capabilities, they reason. Through those capabilities, banks reduce informational asymmetries and the attendent moral hazard and adverse selection, and thereby improve the allocation of credit. As a fast-growth but allegedly bank-centered economy, Japan plays {{an important part in}} these discussions of finance and growth. In early 20 th century Japan firms relied heavily on bank debt, observers argue. Those firms with <b>preferential</b> access to <b>debt</b> outperformed the others, and those that were part of the zaibatsu corporate groups obtained that preferential access through their affiliated banks. With data from {{the first half of the}} century, we ask whether Japanese banks performed the roles Gerschenkron and modern theorists assign them. Notwithstanding the usual accounts, we find that they did not. Japan was not a bank-centered economy; instead, firms relied overwhelmingly on equity finance. It was not an economy where firms with access to bank credit outperformed their rivals; instead, firms earned no advantage from such access. And it was not...|$|R

During the first half of the last century, Japanese firms obtained almost all their funds through decentralized, competitive capital markets. ...|$|R
40|$|Driven by fiscal {{austerity}} and {{disenchantment with}} the performance of state-provided infrastructure services, many governments have turned to the private sector to build, operate, finance, or own infrastructure in power, gas, water, transport, and telecommunications sectors. Private capital flows to developing countries are increasing rapidly; 15 percent of infrastructure investment is now funded by private capital in emerging markets. But relative to needs, such private investment is progressing slowly. Governments are reluctant to raise consumer prices to cost-covering levels, while investors, mindful of experience, fear that governments may renege on promises to maintain adequate prices over the long haul. So investors ask for government support in the form of grants, <b>preferential</b> tax treatment, <b>debt</b> or equity contributions, or guarantees. These subsidies differ in how they allocate risk between private investors and government. Efficiency gains are greatest when private parties assume the risks that they can manage better than the public sector. When governments establish good policies [...] especially cost-covering prices and credible commitments to stick to them [...] investors are willing to invest without special government support. Privatizing assets without government guarantees or other financial support is possible, even where governments are politically unable to raise prices, because investors can achieve the returns they demand by discounting the value of the assets they are purchasing. But this is not possible for new investments (greenfield projects). If prices have been set too low and the government is not willing to raise them, it must give the investor financial support, such as guarantees and other forms of subsidy, to facilitate worthwhile projects that would not otherwise proceed. But guarantees shift costs from consumers to taxpayers, who subsidize users of infrastructure services. Much of that subsidy is hidden, since the government does not record the guarantee in its fiscal accounts. And taxpayers provide unremunerated credit insurance, as the government borrows based on its ability to tax citizens if the project fails, not on the strength of the project itself.

Belize is a small, open economy and {{highly dependent on}} external trade. Real wages {{in the private sector}} have increased only slightly. Belize’s exports of commodities grew strongly in volume terms during the last 10 years. The currency mismatch and liquidity pressures point to a growing exchange rate risk. Belize would have to maintain a significant primary fiscal surplus to reduce indebtedness over the medium term.
