Agate is also still used today for decorative displays, cabochons, beads, carvings and Intarsia art as well as face-polished and tumble-polished specimens of varying size and origin.

Where in the beginning locally found agates were used to make all types of objects for the European market, this became a globalized business {{around the turn of the}} 20th century: Idar-Oberstein imported large quantities of agate from Brazil, as ship's ballast. Making use of a variety of proprietary chemical processes, they produced colored beads that were sold around the globe. Agates have long been used in arts and crafts. The sanctuary of a Presbyterian church in Yachats, Oregon, has six windows with panes made of agates collected from the local beaches.|$|R

60|$|There are two {{or three}} courts in the castle, but of no great size. We were now led across one of them, and {{dismissed}} out of the arched entrance by which we had come in. We found the gendarme still keeping watch on his roofed drawbridge, and as there was the same gentle shower that had been effusing itself all the morning, we availed ourselves of the shelter, more especially as there were some curiosities to examine. These consisted chiefly of wood-carvings,--such as little figures in the national costume, boxes with wreaths of foliage upon them, <b>paper</b> <b>knives,</b> the chamois goat, admirably well represented. We at first hesitated to make any advances towards trade with the gendarme because it was Sunday, and we fancied {{there might be a}} Calvinistic scruple on his part about turning a penny on the Sabbath; but from the little I know of the Swiss character, I suppose they would be as ready as any other men to sell, not only such matters, but even their own souls, or any smaller--or shall we say greater--thing on Sunday or at any other time. So we began to ask the prices of the articles, and met with no difficulty in purchasing a salad spoon and fork, with pretty bas-reliefs carved on the handles, and a napkin-ring. For Rosebud's and our amusement, the gendarme now set a musical-box a-going; and as it played a pasteboard figure of a dentist began to pull the tooth of a pasteboard patient, lifting the wretched simulacrum entirely from the ground, and keeping him in this horrible torture for half an hour. Meanwhile, mamma, Miss Shepard, U----, and J----- sat down all in a row on a bench and sketched the mountains; and as the shower did not cease, though the sun most of the time shone brightly, they were kept actual prisoners of Chillon much longer than we wished to stay.|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} of cutting performance of knifes attempt {{to enhance the}} abrasion resistance of the edge, for example with coatings. Nowadays there are sporadic applications using hardened steel knifes for non-shape cutting, which use a coating of Titanium, Chromium or Titanium aluminium nitride. Thereby are friction minimizing and abrasion protection more important than cutting performance enhancement. The paper describes the results of studies with coated knives which use a super hard Diamond Like Carbon coating (DLC). The trials show that the amorphous carbon coating improves the cutting output of hardened knives. The {{research shows that the}} cutting performance of technical knives can be enhanced through coatings. The amorphous hydrogen-free carbon coating obviously improves the cutting output of hardened stainless steel <b>knives.</b> Coated machine-guided <b>paper</b> <b>knives</b> show a double cutting performance compared to uncoated knifes. Furthermore the tests have not been performed to the end so the difference in practice might be higher than the test results in laboratory. By the coated samples the aimed sharpness protecting effect occurs. The protection of one edge side leads to wear on the uncoated side thus minimize the widing of the edge breadth. Therefore the sharpness of th coated knife stays on longer. To achieve such good results it was very important to produce a very adhesive coating. For that reason the pre-treatment of the sample before coating has been adjusted for this special base material. The micro edged geometry and the coating properties have to be adapted for each application. An integrated view which takes all those parameters into consideration fails. Even though the results show that coatings can improve the cutting performance of hardened knives, {{further research is needed to}} understand the adhesion problems of the coatings at the small edge. The behaviour of the coated side is different to the free surfaces because of its unequal properties. The influence of the roughness and the sharping method is not scientifically defined. The effect to the coated side adhesion is not quite clear and subject of further research. Entnommen aus TEMA</a...|$|R
