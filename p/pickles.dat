5000|$|As with <b>pickled</b> cucumbers, {{there are}} {{multiple}} ways of <b>pickling</b> peppers. The most common is as above, <b>pickling</b> in an acidic brine and canned; next is quick-pickled or refrigerator <b>pickling,</b> which skips the canning step and requires the peppers to be stored in the refrigerator as mentioned above. For lacto-fermented <b>pickled</b> peppers, vinegar is omitted from the salty brine; instead, Lactobacilli convert the sugars of the peppers into lactic acid. Such fermented <b>pickled</b> peppers are often used to make hot sauce. At less than 3% acid, fermented <b>pickled</b> peppers are highly perishable if not canned. Sweet <b>pickling</b> with sugar and acid yields [...] "candied" [...] peppers, as for the jalapeños known as [...] "cowboy candy". <b>Pickled</b> peppers are often made into relishes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pickling</b> is {{the process}} of {{preserving}} or expanding the lifespan of food by either anaerobic fermentation in brine or immersion in vinegar. The resulting food is called a <b>pickle,</b> or, to prevent ambiguity, prefaced with the adjective <b>pickled.</b> The <b>pickling</b> procedure will typically affect the food's texture and flavor. In East Asia, vinaigrette (vegetable oil and vinegar) is also used as a <b>pickling</b> medium. Foods that are <b>pickled</b> include meats, fruits, eggs, and vegetables.|$|R

40|$|<b>Pickling</b> of {{oxidised}} 304 {{stainless steel}} in single or multiple electrolytes was investigated based on weight loss and corrosion potential measurements. A smooth surface finish was obtained after an extended <b>pickling</b> in HCl, but some external oxide scales remained. On <b>pickling</b> in HF, the external oxide scales were fully removed, but internal oxide scales remained, and intergranular corrosion took place. Multi-step <b>pickling</b> in successive HCl and HF electrolytes allowed achieving a smooth surface finish free of any oxide scales. The sequence and duration of <b>pickling</b> steps in such multi-step <b>pickling</b> greatly influenced the final surface finish. Corrosion potential of oxidised stainless steel in both electrolytes could differ, and that difference leaded to a uniform <b>pickling</b> of stainless steel in HCl and a localised <b>pickling</b> in HF.
