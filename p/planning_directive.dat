Starting from the assumption that institutional interplay determines the impact of the EAM on marine policies, the article examines how different forms of interplay (interplay through cognition, commitment and compliance) affect the spread of EAM and its implementation in the BSR. The study finds strong interplay between HELCOM’s BSAP and the EU’s MSFD. Although HELCOM is still an important player in marine governance in the BSR, since it includes Russia, taking over responsibilities for the implementation of EU legislation has repercussions and affects its independence.

40|$|In {{the context}} of the Maritime Spatial <b>Planning</b> <b>Directive</b> and with the {{intention}} of contributing to the implementation of a future maritime spatial plan, it was decided to analyze data from the small scale coastal fisheries sector of Greece and estimate the actual extent of its activities, which is largely unknown to date. To this end we identified the most influential components affecting coastal fishing: fishing capacity, bathymetry, distance from coast, Sea Surface Chlorophyll (Chl-a) concentration, legislation, marine traffic activity, trawlers and purse seiners fishing effort and no-take zones. By means of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) conducted through a stepwise procedure, the potential fishing footprint with the corresponding fishing intensity was derived. The method provides an innovative and cost-effective way {{to assess the impact of}} the, notoriously hard to assess, coastal fleet. It was further considered how the inclusion of all relevant anthropogenic activities (besides fishing) could provide the background needed to plan future marine activities in the framework of Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) and form the basis for a more realistic management approach...|$|E

The CoExist framework is based on the principles of ensuring transparent treatment of different types of information as well as appropriate stakeholder representation which can ensure legitimacy. Empirical findings in six European case studies have been obtained while conducting the CoExist framework.

40|$|Two {{interconnected}} {{challenges in}} C 2 are {{to cope with}} uncertainty and to make timely deci-sions. From the standpoint of a commander these challenges may easily come into conflict with each other. Uncertainty, i. e. gaps in knowledge, may be reduced by collecting and processing additional information - but this takes time. To handle this dilemma the com-mander and his/her staff may have to make assumptions. An assumption is "a supposition on the current situation or a presupposition on the future course of events". If the assump-tions being made are invalid it may have negative consequences for the ability to reach the mission objectives. It is therefore important to assess and to follow up the assumptions during mission planning and execution, {{in order to make}} it possible for timely re-planning if necessary. However, even though the handling of assumptions is considered to be im-portant in both NATO´s <b>planning</b> <b>directive</b> COPD and in the Swedish counterpart SPL, nei-ther COPD nor SPL gives a clear guidance on how to assess the assumptions - apart from an exhortation to use a risk evaluation template. To date there is no theoretically grounded and systematically tested technique for assessing assumptions in C 2. By using a design logic framework and techniques from the area of risk assessment this paper presents the initial step to a possible solution to these problems. The results are a design logic scheme and a design proposition for a technique that is potentially suitable for assessing assump-tions, to be tested in forthcoming empirical studies...|$|E

40|$|Responding {{to calls}} for a more {{theoretically}} driven, post-positivist and radical marine spatial planning research that approaches the policy as a political project, this paper develops a poststructuralist discourse theory approach to critical marine spatial planning. Elaborating radical contingency as an ontological condition of social life, which points to the ineradicability of power and conflict in marine spatial planning social relations, the paper problematizes marine spatial planning as constituting politics, or key practices that attempt to organize human coexistence and thus, conceal this radical contingency. These practices (e. g. ecosystem-based management, participation, planning regulation {{and the organization of}} socio-natural spaces), whose outcomes are far from adaptive, consensual or neutral are discussed as sites of ‘politics’ that effectively marginalize particular groups of people and ‘herd’ their participation and ways of knowing toward achieving limited policy outcomes. Drawing on the EU Marine Spatial <b>Planning</b> <b>Directive,</b> the paper further teases out how specific narratives and rhetorical signifiers around ‘integrating’ and ‘balancing’ potentially irreconcilable sustainable development objectives may interpellate particular stakeholders in ways that render them ideologically complicitous in sustaining, rather than challenging, neoliberal logics of managerialism and economic maximization of marine resources. But in tune with the ontological condition of the social as radically contingent, the paper discusses how and why participatory spaces may constitute a potential space of contestation for marginalized voices and thus, reveal the political moment of marine spatial planning. Calls are made for future empirically grounded research that explores how these marine spatial planning practices are lived in both planning and extra-planning settings, and with what implications for marine protection and extant social relations of power in different marine spatial planning contexts.

Marine monitoring and observation activities generate raw data, this data can be assembled and contextualised, creating data products and information that ultimately contribute to {{our knowledge of the}} marine environment and the extent and impact of human activities therein. However, data generated via marine observation and monitoring activities can only be used in the creation and application of marine knowledge if it can be found, accessed and used. Marine data portals and repositories provide users with access to data, metadata and derived data-products. In addition, these data and information systems are also important users of knowledge outputs from research projects. As such, they {{play a crucial role in}} marine knowledge creation and application, contributing to open innovation and delivering growth in the blue economy. In Europe there are many local, national and regional marine data repositories, together with over-arching portals and repositories at regional and European level including; EMODnet, COPERNICUS Marine Environment and Monitoring Service (CMEMS), SeaDataNet, PANGAEA and the European Atlas of the Sea.

This document outlined the mission, structure, and resources of the new agency. It explained in detail the functions of each subdivision and where the resources of each subdivision were to be obtained.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of the coastal environment is fundamental for efficiently and effectively facing the pollution phenomena as expected by the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, and for limiting the conflicts between anthropic activities and sensitivity areas, as stated by Maritime Spatial <b>Planning</b> <b>Directive.</b> To address this, the Laboratory of Experimental Oceanology and Marine Ecology developed a multi-platform observing network {{that has been in}} operation since 2005 in the coastal marine area of Civitavecchia (Latium, Italy) where multiple uses and high ecological values closely coexist. The Civitavecchia Coastal Environment Monitoring System (C-CEMS), implemented in the current configuration, includes various components allowing one to analyze the coastal conflicts by an ecosystem-based approach. The long-term observations acquired by the fixed stations are integrated with in situ data collected for the analysis of the physical, chemical and biological parameters of the water column, sea bottom and pollution sources detected along the coast. The in situ data, integrated with satellite observations (e. g., temperature, chlorophyll  a and TSM), are used to feed and validate the numerical models, which allow the analysis and forecasting of the dynamics of pollutant dispersion under different conditions. To test the potential capabilities of C-CEMS, two case studies are reported here: (1) the analysis of fecal bacteria dispersion for bathing water quality assessment, and (2) the evaluation {{of the effects of the}} dredged activities on Posidonia meadows, which make up most of the two sites of community importance located along the Civitavecchia coastal zone.

40|$|Reorganization of the Army and {{creation}} of the Defense Intelligence Agency by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara lead {{to the creation of}} the Area Intelligence Analysis Agency. For 20 years before 1962, the concept of technical intelligence had evolved in the US Army. Originally the Army Technical Services were charged with producing intelligence about German and Japanese weapons and about organizations analogous to the Army Technical Services in the German and Japanese armed forces. The Army Technical Services were bureaus within the Headquarters, Department of the Army, which supplied weapons, equipment, and services to the Army, managed the careers of officers in a particular branch (like the Quartermaster Corps, the Chemical Corps, and several medical-related branches in the Army Medical Department), trained specialists, and organized and trained special purpose military units. Each was headed by a general officer with a headquarters in Washington called the office of the chief (Like the Office of the Surgeon General). The Technical Services were: Service Name / Title of Chief / Abbreviation for Headquarters Chemical Corps / Chief Chemical Officer / OCCO Corps of Engineers / Chief of Engineers / OCE Army Medical Service / The Surgeon General* / OTSG Ordnance Corp / Chief of Ordnance / OCO Quartermaster Corps / Quartermaster General / OQMG Signal Corps / Chief Signal Officer / OCSO Transportation Corps / Chief of Transporation / OCT *The Surgeon General, US Army, should not be confused with the Surgeon General of the United States who is the head of the Public Health Service. After World War, Army intelligence efforts changed focus but remained interested in foreign weapons and equipment and technical services organizations in foreign armys. Since there was no national-level military intelligence agency, the Army Technical Services intelligence organizations were assigned to produce various kinds of strategic intelligence. For example, the Transportation Corps produced intelligence concerning railroads, inland waterways, and highways with assistance from its contractor Georgetown University. The Signal Corps produced intelligence on civilian communications and electrical networks with assistance from its contractor the Radio Corporation of America. The Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors of the Corps of Engineers produced intelligence about foreign ports. The Beach Erosion Board of the Corps of Engineers produced intelligence about potential landing beaches. The Corps of Engineers produced intelligence about terrain with assistance from its contractor the Military Geography Branch of the US Geological Survey. The Army Medical Services produced intelligence about public health and the public health systems in foreign countries. McNamara decided to modernize and centralize the way the Army does business. The Army was required to devise plans for centralizing weapons acquisition, military personnel management, training, etc. This required the abolishment and or radical reorganization of the Army Technical Servces. The Army Medical Services and the Corps of Engineers survived with greatly reduced responsibilities. The McNamara reforms of the Army are described in detail in From Root to McNamara: Army Organization and Administration (1975) by James E. Hewes, Jr., an official history produced by the Army Center for Military History which is available at: [URL] Because the Army Technical Services were being abolished, their intelligence functions had to be reassigned.. It was decided to divide the intelligence responsibilities of the old Army Technical Services between two new Army intelligence Agencies: The Army Foreign Science and Technology Center (FSTC) which was responsible for the intelligence about weapons and equipment, and The Area Analysis Intelligence Agency (AAIA) which took over the other intelligence responsibilities of the old Army technical services. That decision was formalized in in a Reorganization <b>Planning</b> <b>Directive,</b> “Department of the Army Reorganization <b>Planning</b> <b>Directive</b> 381 - 2, Technical, Area Analysis, and Order of Battle That decision Intelligence Production, 18 May 1962 ” which is available at: [URL] This file contains detailed instructions for disentangling the intelligence activities of the Army technical services to create the Army Area Intelligence Agency (AAIA), a special purpose military organization subordinate to the Army Map Service within the Corps of Engineers. The Medical Information and Intelligence Agency (MIIA) of the Army Medical Services was to be collocated with the AAIA and to work closely with it. The AAIA was to have about 720 workers, including personnel from contractors, and a budget of approximately 8 million dollars. Enclosure 2 to Tab B (Page 32 of this PDF document), describes the mission of the AAIA as follows: [AAIA] is responsible for planning, developing, and implementing a balanced intelligence program within the area of Army responsibility for the following fields of interest: a. Transportation, b. Military Geography, c. Telecommunications, [and] d. Military Resources. Such a program contains an all source capability and will include initiating and guiding the collection of intelligence information, organizing and maintaining intelligence, and producing and disseminating intelligence in whatever form required for Army, joint, and national intelligence use in R 2 ̆ 6 D, operational and logistical planning, training, and missile support. The Agency will receive and integrate health and sanitation data produced by the Medical Information and Intelligence Agency, Office of the Surgeon General. The organization chart of the AAIA in Enclosure 2 to Tab D (on Page 51 of this PDF document) shows that the AAIA would have three department: (1) A Transportation Department with four divisions: The Highways Division The Railroad Division The Ports Division The Inland Waterways Division (2) A Military Industrial Department two divisions: The Telecommunions Division The Miliary Resources Division (3) An Environment Department with three divisons: The Terrain Division The Urban Areas Division The Coast and Landing Beaches Division A short time after AAIA was organized, it was nationalized when it was absorbed by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).

40|$|This manual defines and {{describes}} the technical intelligence mission.

It has an excellent list of acronyms and glossary. Comment by the depositor A clear understanding of the evolution of technical intelligence may not be needed by the intended audience of this manual, and as far as I know, no comprehensive history exists. However, supposed historical facts included in an official manual ought to be true. This manual fails in that respect. For example, this paragraph on Page 1 - 5 is utter nonsense: Following the Korean War, the United States did not disband its TECHINT capability completely, as had been done at the conclusion of all previous hostilities. But neither did we maintain it at its wartime level. Three small TECHINT detachments remained in place at the Army 2 ̆ 7 s research and development centers. By 1962 two of the detachments merged to form the Army 2 ̆ 7 s Foreign Science and Technology Center. The third detachment established the Missile Intelligence Agency at Redstone Arsenal. The Surgeon General also operated a Medical Intelligence Center at Fort Detrick, MD. At the end of World War II, technical intelligence staffs remained in the offices of the heads of the seven Army Technical Services. Between then and the creation of the Army Foreign Science and Technical Center, many of those staffs were converted into special purpose intelligence agencies as is documented by DA General Orders. The first such agency, the Signal Corps Intelligence Agency was established at Washington, DC, according to Sec. IV, DA GO 39, 18 Aug 49, before the beginning of the Korean War. Paragraph VIII of DA GO 57, 1962, established the Army Foreign Science and Technology Center and transferred the functions, personnel, records, and equipment of the Chemical Corps, Ordnance Corps, Signal Corps, Transportation Corps, and Quartermaster intelligence agencies to it. In addition Corps of Engineer technical intelligence activities which had been housed in the Army Map Service were transferred to it. The intelligence section {{in the office of the}} commanding general of the Army Missile Command was not recognized as an official intelligence production agency until much later in the 1960 s. The Medical Information and Intelligence Agency, which was not at Ft Detrick, was not affected by the reorganization of the Army intelligence activities outlined in Department of the Army Reorganization <b>Planning</b> <b>Directive</b> 381 - 2, 18 May 1962, which is available in the UNL Digital Commons at: [URL] In fact, the intelligence organization which was formed in the Office of the Surgeon General went through a complicated series of reorganizations before it became the National Center for Medical Intelligence at Ft Detrick.

A major difference from the old planned economy is the restructuring of state companies along a commercial basis, with the exception of 150 large state-owned enterprises that remain and report directly to the central government, most having a number of subsidiaries.|$|R

During {{the last}} decade, {{pharmaceutical}} producers did not evaluate the products' price considering the real cost, but rather considering {{on what the}} market can bear. Currently, the competitive pressures pushes to better refine the products prices in the perspective of increasing the market share. The major concern in the vaccine industry is to compare the financial input of the released products batches with the invested amount to define the actual product cost. The variation of the product costs is generally presented as the results of demand levels or capacity use. The estimation of the actual product cost in the vaccine industry leans strategic <b>planning</b> <b>directives</b> to drive production level. In this paper, we propose an extension of an approach that we have recently proposed to calculate actual production costs, considering {{the integration of the}} information along the products' lifecycle. From the cost point of view, the product lifecycle has three major cost phases: (i) R&D program cost, (ii) procurement cost, and (iii) operating and support cost. For each phase, we will focus on the identification of fixed, variable or semi-variable costs...|$|R
