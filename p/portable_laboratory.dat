30|$|Compared {{with other}} {{molecular}} typing techniques, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) {{is currently the}} most popular one [7, 8]. MLST relies on allelic variants in conserved genes to calculate phylogenetic relationship of strains.

The MLST method excels other molecular typing methods of being unambiguous and easily <b>portable</b> between <b>laboratories.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{success of}} this Accelerated Site Technology Deployment (ASTD) project is {{measured}} on several levels. First, the deployment of this innovative approach using in situ characterization, <b>portable</b> field <b>laboratory</b> measurements, and implementation of MARSSIM was successfully established for all three phases of D and D characterization, i. e., pre-job scoping, on-going disposition of waste, and final status surveys {{upon completion of the}} activity. Unlike traditional D and D projects, since the Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor Decommissioning Project (BGRR-DP) is operating on an accelerated schedule, much of the work is being carried out simultaneously. Rather than complete a full characterization of the facility before D and D work begins, specific removal actions require characterization as the activity progresses. Thus, the need for rapid and cost-effective techniques for characterization is heightened. Secondly, since the approach used for this ASTD project was not thoroughly proven prior to deployment, a large effort was devoted to demonstrating technical comparability to project managers, regulators and stakeholders. During the initial phases, large numbers of replicate samples were taken and analyzed by conventional baseline techniques to ensure that BGRR-DP quality assurance standards were met. ASTD project staff prepared comparisons of data gathered using ISOCS and BetaScint with traditional laboratory methods and presented this information to BGRR-DP staff and regulators from EPA Region II, NYS Department of Environmental Conservation, and the Suffolk County Board of Health. As the results of comparability evaluations became available, approval for these methods was received and the techniques associated with in situ characterization, <b>portable</b> field <b>laboratory</b> measurements, and implementation of MARSSIM were gradually integrated into BGRR-DP procedures...|$|R

40|$|The Use of Chemometrics for the Optimization of Experiments in Microfluidic Devices and Detection with Fluorescence in Microfluidic Paper-Based Analytical Devices By Maria Ortega Microfluidic devices (MDs) {{include a}} subset of {{analytical}} tools that integrate many aspects of science, technology, and engineering. Microfluidic technology with its use of micro-sized channels and precise fluid control has grown exponentially {{over the past two}} decades. One major advantage of MDs is their ability to integrate an entire laboratory onto a chip allowing for portable analytical tools referred to as lab-on-a-chip (LOC) or microfluidic chips. Microfluidic chips allow for <b>portable</b> <b>laboratories</b> with a host of applications in the area of point-of-care (POC) diagnostics, bioterrorism, detection, and drug discovery. The first project describes the use of chemometric techniques for the optimization of microfluidic technology. It uses a hybrid neural network to analyze three different parameters in optimizing the fluorescence obtained from the electrostatic binding of 5 -carboxy- 5 -fluorecein-D-Ala-D-Ala-D-Ala (5 -FAM-(D-Ala) 3) to the glycopeptide antibiotic teicoplanin. The information obtained will aid {{in the development of a}} fluorescent binding assay to optimize the fluorescences upon binding of the receptor-ligand pair in a microfluidic chip. The second project involves the design and fabrication of a microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (??PADs) for the detection of arsenic, in the form of As 3 +, from a chemosensor synthesized to contain the fluorescent reporter coumarin and a thiophilic As 3 + cation, N,S-chelate. The specific chemosensor is named ArsenoFlour 1. This MD uses Norland Optical Adhesive 81 (NOA 81) as the polymer deposited onto the paper to form hydrophobic channels of the ??PAD. We were able to rapidly and easily build small analytical tools that can be used in the analysis and experiments with organic solvents, which are novel to paper devices...|$|R
