40|$|<b>Propetamphos</b> is an {{organophosphate}} insecticide that is {{registered in}} California primarily for structural pest control. A total of 371 illnesses {{associated with the}} use of <b>propetamphos</b> alone or in combination with other pesticides have been reported in California from 1982 to 1993. The reported illnesses were predominantly for non-pesticide handlers, involving mostly office workers, restaurant workers, and residents reentering treated areas. The number of illness reports appears to be in decline since 1988. <b>Propetamphos</b> was extensively absorbed and rapidly eliminated when administered orally to laboratory animals. The major nonconjugated and conjugated metabolites were volatiles consisting of acetone- and acetate-type compounds. In the absence of any dermal absorption data, a dermal absorption rate of 50 % was assumed in this document to estimate human absorbed dosage. The workers with potential exposure are the structural pest control operators (PCO) handling propetamphos-containing products. The estimates of absorbed daily dosage (ADD) for PCOs were based on surrogate data and ranged from 13 to 110 µg/kg/day. Occupants and residents entering treated structures could be exposed to <b>propetamphos</b> residues. The estimates of ADD for children and adults reentering a treated resident were 44 and 28 µg/kg/day, respectively. DPR is currently preparing a risk characterization document for <b>propetamphos</b> because it can cause cholinesterase inhibition in laboratory animals at low dosages. This human exposure assessment document was prepared to be incorporated into the risk characterization document for <b>propetamphos...</b>|$|E
40|$|Virulence of Metarhizium anisopliae (Metschnikoff) Sorokin strain ESC- 1 {{against the}} German cockroach, Blattella germanica (L.), was {{determined}} using 5 concentrations ranging from 83107 to 23109 spores per milliliter. The calculated LD 50 value was 4. 18 by 108 spores per milliliter (4. 18 3 105 spores per cockroach). In vitro {{study was conducted}} to determine the compatibility of M. anisopliae strain ESC- 1 with chlorpyrifos, <b>propetamphos,</b> and cyfluthrin. Insecticides did not affect conidial germination but did adversely affect the growth and sporulation of M. anisopliae strain ESC- 1. The growth of M. anisopliae colonies on media amended only with 50 and 500 ppm of chlorpyrifos and 500 ppm of <b>propetamphos</b> treatments at 3, 6, and 9 d was significantly inhibited compared with the control. Similarly, sporulation was significantly reduced in treated colonies exhibiting partial colony growth. The colonies cultured on SDAY media amended with 50 ppm of chlorpyrifos had significantly reduced sporulation compared with the control and no sporulation was observed in colonies cultured on media amended with 500 ppm of chlorpyrifos and <b>propetamphos...</b>|$|E

The bacterial phosphotriesterase (PTE) form Pseudomonas diminuta catalyzes the detoxification {{of a wide variety of}} organophosphate insecticides. Although the use of these agents is essential in increasing crops yields, they frequently act as nerve poisons by blocking mammalian acetylcholinesterase (AChE). AChE is an enzyme responsible for the degradation of acetylcholine. The catalytic activities toward twenty-two organophosphate insecticides, which are currently in agricultural use in the U. S. A., were measured. The kinetic parameters for these insecticides were determined. Some of these insecticidal substrates such as <b>propetamphos</b> and profenofos are chiral compounds. The PTE specificity toward these chiral substrates has been assessed. By examining the enzymatic hydrolysis of these racemic mixtures, it was determined spectroscopically that PTE hydrolyzes both enantiomers at different rates. The enantiomeric preference of the enzymatic hydrolysis for <b>propetamphos</b> is 46 : 1 and 13 : 1 for profenofos. The relative stereochemistry of the enzymatic hydrolysis of both substrates, however, remains unclear. For <b>propetamphos,</b> this ambiguity is due to the failure of developing a method using ??P NMR spectroscopy to visualize the individual peaks of the two stereoisomer components of the racemic product...|$|E

40|$|Hard tick {{infestation}} is {{an important}} problem in both traditional and industrial animal husbandry {{as well as in}} veterinary and public health. Several acaricides have been used to control tick infestation in Iran. Poor control has been attributed to acaricide resistance in tick populations although this has not been demonstrated experimentally. In this study, susceptibility status to <b>propetamphos</b> (Blotic) of 2 - 3 -week-old larvae of Rhipicephalus bursa, {{one of the most common}} tick species in Iran, was evaluated using the FAO recommended larval packet test (LPT) method with some modifications. Log dosage probit analysis of <b>propetamphos</b> dose-response regression lines produced a resistance ratio based on LC 50 in the most resistant strain of approximately 103 -fold. Biochemical assays suggested that the tick strains contained multiple insecticide resistance mechanisms involving elevation of esterases, GSTs, MFOs and alteration of acetylcholinesterase. In light of this data, practical implications for pest and pesticide resistance management strategies are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Metarhizium anisopliae (Metchnikoff) Sorokin strain ESC- 1 was virulent to German cockroach, Blattella germanica (L.). Topical {{application}} of M. anisopliae strain ESC- 1 resulted in mortality ranging from 31. 3 to 86. 3 % in 21 d. The lethal dose (LD 50) of M. anisopliae strain ESC- 1 estimated for German cockroaches was 4. 18 × 108 spores per milliliter. ^ In vitro compatibility studies between insecticides plus M. anisopliae indicated compatibility {{with most of}} the insecticide concentrations used. There {{was no significant difference in}} the germination of conidia cultured on insecticide-amended SDAY media. But colony growth and sporulation was significantly affected by incorporation of insecticide to SDAY media. Colony growth was partially inhibited at 50 and 500 ppm of chlorpyrifos, and 500 ppm of <b>propetamphos.</b> There was no sporulation at 500 ppm of chlorpyrifos and <b>propetamphos,</b> and sporulation was significantly affected at 50 ppm of chlorpyrifos. ^ Both additive and synergistic effects were observed in the in vivo compatibility study illustrating compatibility between the two agents. In general, joint {{application of}} insecticide plus M. anisopliae resulted in an additive effect. The only exception was 300 ppm of <b>propetamphos</b> where a synergistic effect was observed. Lethal time was significantly reduced in many of the insecticides plus M. anisopliae combinations by 50 % or greater than half fold differences compared with M. anisopliae alone. Metarhizium anisopliae, insecticides, and insecticide plus M. anisopliae combinations did not affect the body weight of German cockroaches. ^ There was no detectable level of destruxins identified from the culture filtrate of M. anisopliae strain ESC- 1. Bioassay with destruxins by itself or in combination with sublethal doses of insecticides did not significantly increase mortality in German cockroaches. ...|$|E
40|$|A treated surface {{bioassay}} {{was used}} to detect insecticide resistance to five organophosphorus insecticides (diazinon, chlorfevinphos, chlorpyrifos, dichlofenthion and <b>propetamphos),</b> the synthetic pyrethroid, deltamethrin, and the insect growth regulator, diflubenzuron, in larvae of field strains of Lucilia cuprina, and diazinon in Lucilia sericata from 1990 to 1997. Organophosphate resistance was widespread in both species of blowfly and L. cuprina exhibited side-resistance between diazinon, chlorpyrifos, dichlofenthion and <b>propetamphos</b> but no cross-resistance could be demonstrated with diazinon and deltamethrin, or between diazinon and diflubenzuron. Phenotypic expression of resistance appeared {{to be influenced by}} environmental factors such as season, region, sheep density and year. The relative efficacies of four of the above OPs {{and the extent to which}} the OP resistance status of L. cuprina affected this, was assessed by comparing a susceptible strain of L. cuprina, and a strain known to exhibit OP side-resistance, in a series of in vivo trials. All four treatments provided 19 - 21 weeks protection against susceptible larvae but chlorfenvinphos provided the longest protection (16 - 17 weeks), followed by <b>propetamphos</b> (15 - 16 weeks), dichlofenthion (10 - 13 weeks) and diazinon (9 - 13 weeks), against the resistant strain. Penetration of insect cuticle, non-oxidative and oxidative mechanisms that might contribute to resistance to organophosphate insecticides were examined in larvae and adults from field isolates of L. cuprina. Only non-oxidative mechanisms were considered with respect to L. sericata. The basal mechanism of resistance appeared to be an altered esterase (the E 3 esterase) in L. cuprina and was also suspected to contribute to OP-resistance in L. sericata. Adult and larval strains of L. sericata showed no relationship between level of GST conjugating activity and resistance to diazinon, suggesting that these enzymes do not constitute a mechanism of OP-resistance in this species. Contrasting this was the observation of a strong relationship between the level of GST conjugating activity, with respect to model substrate DCNB, and resistance to diazinon in both adult and larval strains of L. cuprina. This relationship was supported by a study of the OP-conjugating properties of partially purified glutathione S-transferases from resistant L. cuprina larvae. Neither an increase in acetylcholinesterase content nor an insensitive AChE in the central nervous system of larvae of L. cuprina and larvae or adult L. sericata appear to have been selected for in the resistant field strains examined. There did however appear to be a positive correlation between resistance to diazinon and susceptibility of AChE inactivation by tetrachlorvinphos in L. cuprina adults. The significance of this factor was investigated further by multiple regression and it was concluded that this did not have a main effect on resistance in adults. Samples of L. cuprina were further characterised by RAPD-PCR to determine intra-and inter-strain variation. Key features of this analysis were the calculation of phylogenetic similarities in an attempt to better define a 'field strain', the mode of dispersal of the species throughout New Zealand as well as to identify genetic markers of high level insecticide resistance. No markers of resistance were identified but this study emphasised the need to treat each sample as a separate strain as sampling from the same area at different times showed that samples were not identical suggesting there is variable gene flow in and out of areas and populations. Based on biochemical identification of resistance mechanisms, consideration was given to the use of potentiating pairs of insecticides as a method of prolonging the life of some existing OP insecticides. It was shown that prospects for using such pairs is limited due to the widespread OP-resistance observed in L. cuprina. Finally, rather than reiterate discussion of resistance mechanisms, the conclusion of this thesis looks towards applying knowledge of resistance mechanisms effectively within the framework of integrated pest management system (IPM). It discusses areas of weakness in knowledge that need to be addressed and emphasises the need for a susceptibility reservoir if IPM is to succeed at a national level...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of Australian-registered insecticide formulations against Old World screwworm (OWS) myiases for potential use in screwworm containment and eradication programs. Methods: The longevity of protection provided by six insecticidal formulations (subcutaneous ivermectin, doramectin and abamectin, a topically applied aqueous formulation of spinosad, ivermectin controlled-release capsule and a dicyclanil spray-on formulation) {{was tested using}} implants of 1 st-instar OWS larvae on Javanese thin-tail sheep. Therapeutic efficacy of four formulations (topical ivermectin, chlorfenvinphos/cypermethrin mixture, aerosol spinosad formulation and a formulation containing <b>propetamphos</b> and eucalyptus oil) was tested against 2 - and 4 -day-old OWS strikes. Results: Both the ivermectin capsule and dicyclanil spray-on formulation gave 100 % protection against screwworm implants for the full 12 weeks of the study. Ivermectin, doramectin and abamectin administered SC all gave 100 % protection at 3 days post-treatment, but at 2 weeks the protection had become incomplete. Spinosad dipping did not give complete protection at any time. All four therapeutic treatments gave complete resolution of 2 -day-old strikes and topical ivermectin, spinosad and chlorfenvinphos/cypermethrin, but not the propetamphos/eucalyptus oil formulation, gave complete resolution of all 4 -day-old strikes. Conclusion: Dicyclanil spray-on and ivermectin capsule formulations, both registered for use in sheep, but not for cattle or other livestock species, gave much longer protection against screwworm implants than the currently recommended SC ivermectin. Pre-emptive action to facilitate rapid deployment of these formulations {{in the event of}} a screwworm incursion is urgently needed...|$|E
