40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{described}} the bacterial community residing in the guts of giant <b>pandas,</b> together {{with the presence of}} lignocellulolytic enzymes. However, a more comprehensive understanding of the intestinal microbial composition and its functional capacity in giant <b>pandas</b> remains a major goal. Here, we conducted a comparison of bacterial, fungal and homoacetogenic microbial communities from fecal samples taken from two geriatric and two adult captive giant <b>pandas.</b> 16 S rDNA amplicon pyrosequencing revealed that Firmicutes and Proteobacteria are the most abundant microbiota in both geriatric and adult giant <b>pandas.</b> However, members of phylum Actinobacteria found in adult giant <b>pandas</b> were absent in their geriatric counterparts. Similarly, ITS 1 amplicon pyrosequencing identified developmental changes in the most abundant fungal classes from Sordariomycetes in adult <b>pandas</b> to Saccharomycetes in geriatric <b>pandas.</b> Geriatric <b>pandas</b> exhibited significantly higher abundance of a potential probiotic fungus (Candida tropicalis) as compared to adult <b>pandas,</b> indicating their importance in the normal digestive physiology of aged <b>pandas.</b> Our study also reported the presence of a lignocellulolytic white-rot fungus, Perenniporia medulla-panis, and the evidence of novel homoacetogens residing in th...|$|R

The zoo grows its own 8000 m2 plantation of special bamboo specially for the feeding of the giant <b>pandas.</b> These <b>pandas</b> are a sign of the twentieth anniversary of friendly Sino-Singapore relations. The park also received a conservation donation from CapitaLand. The names of the two <b>pandas</b> were selected from entries of a public naming competition organised in 2010.

50|$|<b>Pandas</b> {{will travel}} between {{different}} habitats {{if they need}} to, {{so they can get}} the nutrients that they need and to balance their diet for reproduction. For six years, scientists studied six <b>pandas</b> tagged with GPS collars at the Foping Reserve in the Qinling Mountains. They took note of their foraging and mating habits, and analysed samples of their food and feces. The <b>pandas</b> would move from the valleys in to the Qinling Mountains and would only return to the valleys in autumn. During the summer months bamboo shoots rich in protein are only available at higher altitudes which causes low calcium rates in the <b>pandas</b> and during breeding season the <b>pandas</b> would trek back down to eat bamboo leaves rich in calcium.|$|R

5|$|Bears have {{a fairly}} simple {{digestive}} system typical for carnivorans, with a single stomach, short undifferentiated intestines and no cecum. Even the herbivorous giant <b>panda</b> still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut. Bears must {{spend much of their}} time feeding in order to gain enough nutrition from foliage. The <b>panda,</b> in particular, spends 12–15 hours a day feeding.|$|E
50|$|The Alberta <b>Pandas</b> {{defeated}} the McGill Martlets {{to claim the}} 2010 Canadian Interuniversity Championship. The <b>Pandas</b> ended the Martlets historic 86 game unbeaten streak against CIS opponents. Said streak dated back to December 30 of 2007. It was the <b>Pandas</b> who also beat the Martlets back on that date. Alberta had notched a 2-1 shootout victory. With the win, the <b>Pandas</b> also snapped the Martlets 20 game unbeaten streak in the postseason. This streak is also linked to the Alberta <b>Pandas</b> who claimed a 4-0 win in the 2007 CIS gold medal game. In the 2010 Championship Game, Melody Howard’s unassisted goal at 6:09 {{in the first period}} held up as the game-winning goal. Forward Alana Cabana scored the second goal of the game.|$|R

5|$|Fossils of the extinct red <b>panda</b> Parailurus anglicus {{have been}} {{unearthed}} from China {{in the east}} to Britain in the west. In 1977, a single tooth of Parailurus was discovered in the Pliocene Ringold Formation of Washington. This first North American record is almost identical to European specimens and indicates the immigration of this species from Asia. In 2004, a tooth from a red <b>panda</b> species never before recorded in North America was discovered at the Gray Fossil Site in Tennessee. The tooth dates from 4.5–7 million years ago. This species, described as Pristinailurus bristoli, indicates that a second, more primitive ailurine lineage inhabited North America during the Miocene. Cladistic analysis suggests that Parailurus and Ailurus are sister taxa. Additional fossils of Pristinailurus bristoli were discovered at the Gray Fossil Site in 2010 and in 2012. The frequency with which <b>panda</b> fossils are being found at Gray Fossil Site suggests the species played {{a large role in}} the overall ecosystem of the area.|$|E
