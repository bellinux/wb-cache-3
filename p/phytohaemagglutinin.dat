50|$|<b>Phytohaemagglutinin</b> (PHA, or phytohemagglutinin) is a lectin {{found in}} plants, {{especially}} certain legumes. PHA actually {{consists of two}} closely related proteins, called leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) and PHA-E. The letters E and L indicate these proteins agglutinate erythrocytes and leukocytes. <b>Phytohaemagglutinin</b> has carbohydrate-binding specificity for a complex oligosaccharide containinggalactose, N-acetylglucosamine, and mannose.|$|E
50|$|Lymphocytes cultured with <b>phytohaemagglutinin</b> can be {{used for}} {{karyotype}} analysis.|$|E
50|$|Like many beans, butter {{beans are}} toxic (containing e.g. <b>phytohaemagglutinin)</b> if not boiled {{for at least}} 10 minutes.|$|E
50|$|Runner beans, {{like all}} beans, contain the toxic protein <b>phytohaemagglutinin</b> and thus should be cooked well before eating.|$|E
50|$|Naturally {{occurring}} toxins: mycotoxins, <b>phytohaemagglutinin,</b> pyrrolizidine alkaloids, grayanotoxin, mushroom toxins, scombrotoxin (histamine), ciguatera, shellfish toxins (see shellfish poisoning), tetrodotoxin, {{among many}} others.|$|E
50|$|Like many legumes, C. cathartica {{contains}} antinutrients {{and requires}} some processing or preparation {{before it can}} be used for food. Antinutrients in the species include phenols, tannins, and lectins such as <b>phytohaemagglutinin.</b> Pressure cooking can reduce antinutrients. Roasting is somewhat less effective.|$|E

5000|$|Cannellini (or fazolia,), {{a variety}} popular {{in central and}} {{southern}} Italy, but was first developed in Argentina. They are larger than navy beans, related to the kidney bean and, like the kidney bean, has higher levels of the toxic lectin <b>phytohaemagglutinin.</b> They are used in minestrone soups.|$|E
50|$|Both {{varieties}} {{contain a}} lot of amino acids; yeheb seeds have a high content of the essential amino acids lysine and arginine, but are deficient in tryptophan and isoleucine. <b>Phytohaemagglutinin,</b> a toxic lectin often present in leguminous, is absent in Yeheb seeds; this is an additional nutritional advantage.|$|E
50|$|The toxic {{compound}} <b>phytohaemagglutinin,</b> a lectin, {{is present in}} many common bean varieties, but is especially concentrated in red kidney beans. White kidney beans contain about a third as much toxin as the red variety; broad beans (Vicia faba) contain 5 to 10% as much as red kidney beans.|$|E
50|$|Cooking {{increases}} the digestibility of many foods which are inedible or poisonous when raw. For example, raw cereal grains {{are hard to}} digest, while kidney beans are toxic when raw or improperly cooked due {{to the presence of}} <b>phytohaemagglutinin,</b> which is inactivated by cooking for at least ten minutes at 100 C.|$|E
50|$|Medicago turbinata or Southern medick is a {{plant species}} of the genus Medicago It is found {{throughout}} the Mediterranean basin. It forms a symbiotic relationship with the bacterium Sinorhizobium medicae, which is capable of nitrogen fixation. An unidentified lectin isolated from M. turbinata has shown limited usefulness as a <b>phytohaemagglutinin.</b> The seed weight is 4.66 pounds.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{symptoms}} of <b>phytohaemagglutinin</b> poisoning are nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Onset is {{from one to}} three hours after consumption of improperly prepared beans, and symptoms typically resolve within a few hours. Consumption of as few as four or five raw, soaked kidney beans can cause symptoms. Canned red kidney beans, though, are safe to use immediately.|$|E
50|$|Some {{kinds of}} raw beans contain a harmful {{tasteless}} toxin, lectin <b>phytohaemagglutinin,</b> {{that must be}} removed by cooking. Red and kidney beans are particularly toxic, but other types also pose risks of food poisoning. A recommended method is to boil the beans for at least ten minutes; undercooked beans may be more toxic than raw beans.|$|E
50|$|As {{the name}} implies, snap beans break easily when the pod is bent, giving off a {{distinct}} audible snap sound. The pods of snap beans (green, yellow and purple in colour) are harvested {{when they are}} rapidly growing, fleshy, tender (not tough and stringy), bright in colour, and the seeds are small and underdeveloped (8 to 10 days after flowering). Raw or undercooked beans contain a toxic protein called <b>phytohaemagglutinin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Patients with CHH usually {{suffer from}} {{cellular}} immunodeficiency. In {{the study of}} 108 Finnish patients with CHH there was detected mild to moderate form of lymphopenia, decreased delayed type of hypersensitivity and impaired responses to <b>phytohaemagglutinin.</b> This leads to susceptibility to and, in some more severe cases, mortality from infections early in childhood.

50|$|The DNA on {{the slide}} is a {{reference}} sample, {{and is thus}} obtained from a karyotypically normal man or woman, though it is preferential to use female DNA as they possess two X chromosomes which contain far more genetic information than the male Y chromosome. <b>Phytohaemagglutinin</b> stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes are used. 1mL of heparinised blood is added to 10ml of culture medium and incubated for 72 hours at 37 °C {{in an atmosphere of}} 5% CO2. Colchicine is added to arrest the cells in mitosis, the cells are then harvested and treated with hypotonic potassium chloride and fixed in 3:1 methanol/acetic acid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phytohaemagglutinin</b> can be {{deactivated}} by cooking beans for {{ten minutes}} at boiling point (100 °C, 212 °F). Insufficient cooking, such as in a slow cooker at 80 °C/ 176 °F, however, can increase the toxicity up to fivefold. To safely cook the beans, the U.S Food and Drug Administration recommends boiling for 30 minutes to ensure they reach a sufficient temperature for long enough to completely destroy the toxin. For dry beans, the FDA also recommends an initial soak of at least 5 hours in water which should then be discarded. Outbreaks of poisoning {{have been associated with}} cooking kidney beans in slow cookers.|$|E
5000|$|These {{results have}} hatched further studies, {{numbering}} over 200. One of these {{went on to}} strongly suggest that expressive writing {{has the potential to}} actually provide a 'boost' to the immune system, perhaps explaining the reduction in physician visits. This was shown by measuring lymphocyte response to the foreign mitogens <b>phytohaemagglutinin</b> (PHA) and concanavalin A (ConA) just prior to and 6 weeks after writing. The significantly increased lymphocyte response led to speculation that expressive writing enhances immunocompetence. The results of a preliminary study of 40 people diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder suggests that routinely engaging in expressive writing may be effective in reducing symptoms of depression.|$|E
50|$|In {{medicine}} these proteins {{are useful}} {{and are used}} as a mitogen to trigger T-lymphocyte cell division and to activate latent HIV-1 from human peripheral lymphocytes. In neuroscience, anterograde tracing is a research method that uses the protein product <b>phytohaemagglutinin</b> PHA-L as a molecular tracer {{that can be taken}} up by the cell and transported across the synapse into the next cell thereby tracing the path of axonal projections and relative connections that nerve impulses travel beginning with the source located at the perikaryon (cell body or soma) and through the presynaptic part located on neuron's efferent axon {{all the way to the}} point of termination at the efferent synapse which then provides input to another neuron.|$|E

50|$|If a {{large part}} of the cooking time is spent at {{temperatures}} lower than 60 °C (as when the contents of the cooker are slowly cooling over a long period), a danger of food poisoning due to bacterial infection, or toxins produced by multiplying bacteria, arises. It is essential to heat food sufficiently at the outset of vacuum cooking; 60 °C throughout the dish for 10 minutes is sufficient to kill most pathogens of interest, effectively pasteurizing the dish. Some foods, such as kidney beans, fava beans, and many other varieties of beans contain a toxin, <b>phytohaemagglutinin,</b> that requires boiling at 100 °C for at least 10 minutes to break down to safe levels. The best practice is to bring briefly to a rolling boil then put the pot in the flask. This keeps it hottest longest. With big chunks of food, boil a little longer before putting into the flask.|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} of lymph node, bone marrow, splenic and thymic lymphocytes to <b>phytohaemagglutinin</b> and Pokeweed mitogen has been studied.

40|$|The {{effects of}} pre-stimulation {{treatment}} with anti-lymphocytic globulin and <b>phytohaemagglutinin</b> on the primary humoral response to bovine serum albumin and sheep erythrocytes were studied in Hooded and Wistar rats. <b>Phytohaemagglutinin</b> stimulates the immune response to sheep erythrocytes in Hooded rats while initially inhibiting agglutinin production in Wistars. <b>Phytohaemagglutinin</b> also potentiates the immunosuppressive effects of anti-lymphocytic globulin in Wistar rats...|$|E
40|$|Myelin Basic Protein, one of {{the major}} {{membrane}} protein component of the central nervous system, was used to probe the molecular mechanism of cellular activation by <b>phytohaemagglutinin.</b> Pre-treatment of human lymphocytes with myelin basic protein results in a lower rising of cytosolic concentration of free calcium after stimulation with <b>phytohaemagglutinin.</b> This effect is dependent on myelin basic protein concentration and on the preincubation time of the protein with the cells. It is not due to a interaction between myelin basic protein and <b>phytohaemagglutinin,</b> but appears to be a consequence of the binding of the protein to the cell surface. The reduction of the rise of cytosolic calcium induced by <b>phytohaemagglutinin</b> is specific for the myelin basic protein because other proteins like albumin and protamine have no effect...|$|E
40|$|In {{contrast}} to the million cells used by many current workers, careful analysis of lymphocyte transformation to <b>phytohaemagglutinin</b> determined optimum conditions as (i) 200, 000 lymphocytes in 1 ml of culture fluid in 100 × 12 -mm round-bottomed glass tubes (ii) <b>phytohaemagglutinin</b> at 1 μg/tube (iii) 3 H-thymidine at 1 μCi/tube (iv) with a convenient incorporation time 4 hr (v) starting 44 hr after adding <b>phytohaemagglutinin.</b> It was then found 10 % autologous serum was the optimum concentration in the culture fluid.
