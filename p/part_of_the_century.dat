5|$|A {{large number}} of {{technological}} changes {{took place during the}} 1970s.

Vacuum pumps were added to the tubing systems, and preheaters were developed to recycle heat lost in the steam. Producers developed reverse-osmosis machines to take a portion of water out of the sap before it was boiled, increasing processing efficiency.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{tradition}} {{declined in the}} early to mid-twentieth century, in part due to opposition from some local Christian clergy and changing social conditions, it was revived in new forms in the mid-to-latter <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century.</b> The tradition has also inspired various artistic depictions, appearing, for instance, {{in the work of the}} painter Clive Hicks-Jenkins and the poet Vernon Watkins.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 19th century, the {{collection}} of 15th- and 16th-century Netherlandish cut-out, as miniatures or parts for albums, became fashionable amongst connoisseurs such as William Young Ottley, leading {{to the destruction of}} many manuscripts.

5|$|The {{municipal}} charter {{was passed}} by the state legislature on February13, 1832. The city's growth during the 19thcentury is indicated by the increase in its population; in 1845 the United States Census ranked Utica as the 29th-largest in the country (with 20,000 residents), more than the populations of Chicago, Detroit and Cleveland, respectively. In the latter <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> Chicago became a boomtown based on resource extraction and processing from the Midwest, and as a railroad center.|$|E
5|$|Bayard's Cove Fort, {{also known}} {{historically}} as Berescove or Bearscore Castle, is an English 16th-century artillery blockhouse, built {{to defend the}} harbour entrance at Dartmouth in Devon. Constructed in the early <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> it had eleven gunports for heavy artillery and was intended to engage enemy vessels that broke past the external defences of the Dartmouth and Kingswear castles. It remained armed during the English Civil War, but was neglected in the 18th century and used for storage. The fort was restored in the late 19th century and is now managed by English Heritage and open to visitors.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{placed the}} young heir to Ludlow, another Edmund Mortimer, {{under house arrest}} {{in the south of}} England, and kept a firm grip on Ludlow Castle himself. This persisted until Henry V finally granted Edmund his estates in 1413, with Edmund going on to serve the Crown overseas. As a result, the Mortimers rarely visited the castle during the first <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> despite the {{surrounding}} town having become prosperous in the wool and cloth trades. Edmund fell heavily into debt and having sold his rights to his Welsh estates to a consortium of nobles, before dying childless in 1425.|$|E

5|$|Scottish Protestantism in {{the seventeenth}} century was highly focused on the Bible, which was seen as infallible and the major source of moral authority. In the early <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century</b> the Genevan {{translation}} was commonly used. In 1611 the Kirk adopted the Authorised King James Version and the first Scots version was printed in Scotland in 1633, but the Geneva Bible continued to be employed into the late seventeenth century. Many Bibles were large, illustrated and highly valuable objects. They often became the subject of superstitions, being used in divination. Family worship was strongly encouraged by the Covenanters. Books of devotion were distributed to encourage the practice and ministers were encouraged to investigate whether this was being carried out.|$|E
5|$|Situated {{along the}} lower Little Tennessee, lower Tellico, and lower Hiwassee rivers, the Overhill towns rose to {{prominence}} within the Cherokee Nation {{in the early}} 18th century, when they began to standardize trade with the British colonists. In the early <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> the Overhill towns' remote location {{at the far end}} of the Trading Path meant they were reached only by those traders and explorers adventurous enough to make the difficult journey to the interior over the mountain range. By the middle of the century, the Overhill towns were consistently courted by both British and French emissaries, as the two powers struggled for the control of the continent and the lucrative fur trade.|$|E
5|$|The Kaluza–Klein {{theory and}} {{subsequent}} attempts by Einstein to develop unified field theory were never completely successful. In part {{this was because}} Kaluza–Klein theory predicted a particle {{that has never been}} shown to exist, and in part because it was unable to correctly predict the ratio of an electron's mass to its charge. In addition, these theories were being developed just as other physicists were beginning to discover quantum mechanics, which would ultimately prove successful in describing known forces such as electromagnetism, as well as new nuclear forces that were being discovered throughout the middle <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century.</b> Thus it would take almost fifty years for the idea of new dimensions to be taken seriously again.|$|E

5|$|Before Michigan {{became a}} state, the first land {{transportation}} corridors were the Indian trails. The French-Indian Trail ran through southeastern Michigan between Toledo, Monroe and Detroit. The Saginaw Trail ran north from Detroit to the Saginaw area where it {{connected with the}} original Mackinaw Trail that ran roughly parallel to, and west of, the modern I-75. Another path, the Cheboygan Trail, ran parallel to the modern freeway to the east between the West Branch area and Cheboygan. In the UP, {{an extension of the}} Mackinac Trail connected St. Ignace and Sault Ste. Marie. In the 19th century, the Michigan Legislature chartered private companies to build and operate plank roads or turnpikes in the state, many of which replaced the original Indian trails. These roads were originally made of oak planks, but later legislation permitted gravel as well. By {{the first decade of the}} 20th century, only 23 of the 202chartered turnpikes were still in operation; many companies that received a charter never built their specified roadways. The remaining plank roads were turned over to the state or purchased by railway companies in the early <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 5th {{century the}} western section of the empire was divided into smaller {{political}} units, ruled by the tribes that had invaded in the early <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century.</b> The deposition of the last emperor of the west, Romulus Augustulus, in 476 has traditionally marked {{the end of the}} Western Roman Empire. By 493 the Italian peninsula was conquered by the Ostrogoths. The Eastern Roman Empire, {{often referred to as the}} Byzantine Empire after the fall of its western counterpart, had little ability to assert control over the lost western territories. The Byzantine emperors maintained a claim over the territory, but while none of the new kings in the west dared to elevate himself to the position of emperor of the west, Byzantine control of most of the Western Empire could not be sustained; the reconquest of the Mediterranean periphery and the Italian Peninsula (Gothic War) in the reign of Justinian (r. 527–565) was the sole, and temporary, exception.|$|E
5|$|During {{the sixteenth}} century, Scotland {{underwent}} a Protestant Reformation {{that created a}} predominately Calvinist national kirk, which was strongly Presbyterian in outlook; the Reformation severely reduced the powers of bishops, but did not abolish them. In the earlier <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> the teachings of first Martin Luther and then John Calvin began to influence Scotland, particularly through Scottish scholars who had visited continental and English universities and who had often trained in the Catholic priesthood. The influence of the English was also more direct, as they supplied books and distributed Bibles and Protestant literature in the Lowlands when they invaded in 1547. Particularly important {{was the work of}} the Lutheran Scot Patrick Hamilton. His execution with other Protestant preachers in 1528, and of the Zwingli-influenced George Wishart in 1546, who was burnt at the stake in St. Andrews on the orders of Cardinal Beaton, did nothing to stem the growth of these ideas. Wishart's supporters, who included a number of Fife lairds, assassinated Beaton soon after and seized St. Andrews Castle, which they held for a year before they were defeated with the help of French forces. The survivors, including chaplain John Knox, were condemned to be galley slaves, helping to create resentment of the French and martyrs for the Protestant cause.|$|E

5|$|From {{the late}} 15th century, {{a number of}} {{painters}} emphasised landscape in their works, a development led {{in part by the}} shift in preference from religious iconography to secular subjects. Second-generation Netherlandish painters applied the mid-14th-century dictum of natural representation. This was born of the rising affluence of the region's middle class, many of whom had now travelled south and seen countryside noticeably different from their flat homeland. At the same time, the later <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century</b> saw the emergence of specialisation and a number of masters focused on detailing landscape, most notably Konrad Witz in the mid-15th century, and later Joachim Patinir. Most innovations in this format came from artists living in the Dutch regions of the Burgundian lands, most notably from Haarlem, Leiden and 's-Hertogenbosch. The significant artists from these areas did not slavishly reproduce the scenery before them, but in subtle ways adapted and modified their landscapes to reinforce the emphasis and meaning of the panel they were working on.|$|E
5|$|Scottish Protestantism {{was focused}} on the Bible, which was seen as infallible and the major source of moral authority. Many Bibles were large, {{illustrated}} and highly valuable objects. In the early <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century</b> the Genevan translation was commonly used.

Books of devotion were distributed to encourage the practice and ministers were encouraged to investigate whether this was being carried out. The seventeenth century marked the high-water mark of kirk discipline. Kirk sessions were able to apply religious sanctions, such as excommunication and denial of baptism, to enforce godly behaviour and obedience. In more difficult cases of immoral behaviour they could work with the local magistrate, in a system modelled on that employed in Geneva.|$|E
5|$|The Blade started {{publishing}} weekly in January 1983 and coverage {{shifted to the}} AIDS crisis and news about this newly emerging disease. The ever-breaking news caused the paper to remain in a heightened state of coverage and nearly exhausted the papers resources {{with members of the}} community having to step in to support the work of the Blade. The reporting of the AIDS crisis from this timeframe allowed the newspaper to come of age to the mature and professionally driven publication seen today. In June 1988, the editors of the paper used a computer to layout the paper for the first time. The 1990s saw increases in readership and circulation of the Washington Blade. In April 1993, during the 1993 Gay March on Washington, the paper published its largest edition to date consisting of 216 pages. The paper expanded into new markets and mediums with the 1995 launch of the online version of the Blade, followed two years later with the launching of a sister publication in New York, called the New York Blade. In the later <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>century,</b> coverage was expanded to include local and national news, as well as international news of interest to the LGBT community.|$|E
