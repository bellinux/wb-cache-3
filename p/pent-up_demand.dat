The subsequent ban is thought to have contributed to illiteracy in 19th-century Lithuania.|$|E

25|$|Polish {{immigration}} to the United States experienced a small wave {{in the years following}} 1989. Specifically, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent fall of Soviet control freed emigration from Poland. A <b>pent-up</b> <b>demand</b> of Poles who previously were not allowed to emigrate was satisfied, and many left for Germany or America. The United States Immigration Act of 1990 admitted immigrants from 34 countries adversely affected by a previous piece of immigration legislation; in 1992, when the Act was implemented, over a third of Polish immigrants were approved under this measure. The most popular destination for Polish immigrants following 1989 was Chicago, followed by New York City. This was the oldest cohort of immigrants from Poland, averaging 29.3 years in 1992.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though both}} plants were busy during the war, {{the company did}} not prosper in the forties due to {{shortages}} of lumber and labor as the country's workforce went to war. Minutes of the 1946 stockholders' meeting show the company's lumber inventory had been reduced, from over 3 million board feet in 1942, to just over a million in 1946. After the war, there was <b>pent-up</b> <b>demand</b> not only for boxes and crates, but also for furniture that the Tacoma plant had been producing. The company expanded to produce box-springs, and began an effort to improve handling of lumber to be kiln-dried. Both plants also continued to replace aging steam engines and boilers with electrical mill machinery. But there were no dividends distributed to stockholders for 1946. The trends of the decade were higher wages, shortages of materials, higher prices, and heavy competition, especially from local non-unionized factories.|$|E

Chamberlain was initially reluctant, feeling {{that he should not}} leave the Post Office before he [...] "had a chance of doing something there", but decided that [...] "it would not be playing the game" [...] to refuse Bonar Law's request. There was a great shortage of housing in Britain as a result of <b>pent-up</b> <b>demand</b> from the war years, and almost all housing was rent controlled, giving builders little incentive to build more. Any removal of rent restrictions would be wildly unpopular. Chamberlain introduced a Housing Act in April 1923 that provided subsidies for private companies, and extended rent control until 1925. He expected rent control to be gradually abolished as the housing supply increased, but the restrictions remained in force until 1933, when a new scheme was enacted.|$|E
40|$|No {{country in}} Asia has more {{experience}} with democratic institu-tions than the Philippines. Over {{more than a}} century—from the representational structures of the Malolos republic of 1898 to the polit-ical tutelage of American colonial rule, from the cacique democracy of the postwar republic to the restoration {{of democracy in the}} People Power uprising of 1986 —Filipinos know both the promise of democ-racy and the problems of making democratic structures work for the benefit of all. Some 100 years after the introduction of national-level democratic institutions to the Philippines, the sense of frustration over the character of the country’s democracy is arguably more apparent than ever before. 1 On the one hand, the downfall of President Joseph Estrada in January 2001 revealed the capacity of many elements of civil society to demand accountability and fairness from their leaders; on the other hand, the popular uprisings of April and May 2001 —involving thousands of urban poor supporters of Estrada—highlighted the con-tinuing failure of democratic structures to respond {{to the needs of the}} poor and excluded. Philippine democracy is, indeed, in a state of crisis. In this article we will examine the country’s current democratic deficit, that is, the enormous need for responding to <b>pent-up</b> <b>demands</b> and pressures from below, as well as the incapacity of the country’s demo-cratic institutions to do so with any degree of effectiveness. Although there are many ways in which this deficit might be filled, we argue that there is one crucial factor: the creation of more effective and cohesive political parties, oriented to programmatic rather than particularistic goals, policy rather than pork. Stronger parties can promote clearer choices to voters and help to structure political competition toward the realization of aggregate rather than particularistic interests. 2 Because institutional deficiencies bear the bulk of the blame for the many histor...|$|R

Marketing relied heavily on the public's nostalgia for the series, with products taking inspiration from all four films. Paramount spent at least $150 million to promote the film, whereas most film promotions range from $70 to 100 million. As well as fans, the film also needed to appeal to younger viewers. Licensing deals include Expedia, Dr Pepper, Burger King, M's and Lunchables. Paramount sponsored an Indiana Jones open wheel car for Marco Andretti in the 2008 Indianapolis 500, and his racing suit was designed to resemble Indiana Jones's outfit. The distributor also paired with M's to sponsor the #18 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota, with NASCAR driver Kyle Busch behind the wheel, in the 2008 Dodge Challenger 500 at Darlington Raceway. Kyle Busch and the #18 team won the race and visited victory lane with Indiana Jones on the car.

Human civilization before his rule had suffered from twin weaknesses: {{that it could be}} controlled by a single authority, and that it was totally dependent upon melange, found on only one planet in the known universe. Leto's prescient visions had shown that humanity would be threatened by extinction in any number of ways; his solution was to place humanity on his [...] "Golden Path," [...] a plan for humanity's survival. Leto governs as a benevolent tyrant, providing for his people's physical needs, but denying them any spiritual outlets other than his own compulsory religion (as well as maintaining a monopoly on spice and thus total control of its use). Personal violence of any kind is banned, as is nearly all space travel, creating a <b>pent-up</b> <b>demand</b> for freedom and travel. The Bene Gesserit, Ixians, and Tleilaxu find themselves seeking ways to regain some of their former power or unseat Leto altogether. Leto also conducts his own selective breeding program among the descendants of his twin sister Ghanima, finally arriving at Siona, daughter of Moneo, whose actions are hidden from prescient vision. Leto engineers his own assassination, knowing it will result in rebellion and revolt but also in an explosion in travel and colonization. The death of Leto's body also produces new sandtrout, which will eventually give rise to a population of sandworms and a new cycle of spice production.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—With the {{successful}} deployment of IEEE 802. 11 a/b/g wireless local area networks (WLANs) and the <b>pent-up</b> market <b>demand</b> for high speed wireless access, the IEEE 802. 11 n protocol {{has emerged as}} a promising standard with major enhancements. In order to scale to the high physical layer transmission rate of up to 600 Mbps, the current medium access control (MAC) protocol requires significant improvements. Towards this end, several packet aggregation schemes have been proposed to reduce the inherent protocol overhead. However, choosing large frame sizes would result in increased channel access delay and jitter especially in delay-critical applications. In this paper, we propose an analytical model to obtain the optimal frame size with regard to the delay constraints of nodes. In particular, we model IEEE 802. 11 n aggregation scheme as a constrained convex optimization problem so as to maximize network throughput performance while considering delay constraints. Simulation results justify that our proposed model exactly satisfies average delay require-ments of network nodes. I...|$|R
