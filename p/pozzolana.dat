40|$|The study {{present the}} {{behaviour}} of fly ash/Portland cement mix, Calcined clay /Portland cement mix and rice husk ash / Portland cement mix as cementing {{agents in the}} production of concrete. Mix ratio of 1 : 2 : 4 and percentage replacement level: 0, 10, 20, and 30 percents of cement by the various <b>pozzolanas</b> were used. Concrete cubes of size 150 mm x 150 mm x 150 mm were cast, cured in aggressive media (CuSO 4 and NaCl solutions) and crushed at 30 days, 60 days and 90 days to determine their compressive strength hence durability. Test results indicated that fly ash, calcined clay, and rice husk ash were pozzolanic. Compressive strength increases for calcined clay as its contents increases from 10 %- 30 % signifying improved durability, while it is the opposite for fly ash and rice husk ash. All three <b>pozzolanas</b> showed improved durability, with fly ash been the most workable and calcined clay the least workable. Though, the results of the compressive strength of the concrete cubes made from portland-pozzolana cement (PPC) were not higher than that of the control (0 % Portland cement replacement), they were all higher than the minimum strength specified in the British Standard code (ASTM C 618, 1992). It was also observed that NaCl solution have a more severe effect on the durability for all three <b>pozzolanas.</b> The purpose of the study is to develop alternative to cement for use in aggressive environment...|$|R

25|$|Owing to its {{pozzolanic}} properties, fly ash {{is used as}} {{a replacement}} for Portland cement in concrete. The use of fly ash as a pozzolanic ingredient was recognized as early as 1914, although the earliest noteworthy study of its use was in 1937. Roman structures such as aqueducts or the Pantheon in Rome used volcanic ash or <b>pozzolana</b> (which possesses similar properties to fly ash) as pozzolan in their concrete.

25|$|As {{the walls}} {{carrying}} these vaults were also built in concrete with occasional bond courses of brick, the whole structure was homogeneous. One {{of the important}} ingredients of the mortar was a volcanic deposit found near Rome, known as <b>pozzolana,</b> which, when the concrete had set, not only made the concrete as solid as the rock itself, but {{to a certain extent}} neutralized the thrust of the vaults, which formed shells equivalent to that of a metal lid; the Romans, however, do not seem to have recognized the value of this <b>pozzolana</b> mixture, for they otherwise provided amply for the counteracting of any thrust which might exist by the erection of cross walls and buttresses. In the tepidaria of the Thermae and in the basilica of Constantine, in order to bring the thrust well within the walls, the main barrel vault of the hall was brought forward on each side and rested on detached columns, which constituted the principal architectural decoration. In cases where the cross vaults intersecting were not of the same span as those of the main vault, the arches were either stilted so that their soffits might be of the same height, or they formed smaller intersections in {{the lower part of the}} vault; in both of these cases, however, the intersections or groins were twisted, for which it was very difficult to form a centering, and, moreover, they were of disagreeable effect: though every attempt was made to mask this in the decoration of the vault by panels and reliefs modelled in stucco.|$|E
25|$|The Greeks used {{volcanic}} tuff {{from the island}} of Thera as their pozzolan and the Romans used crushed volcanic ash (activated aluminium silicates) with lime. This mixture was able to set under water increasing its resistance. The material was called <b>pozzolana</b> {{from the town of}} Pozzuoli, west of Naples where volcanic ash was extracted. In the absence of pozzolanic ash, the Romans used powdered brick or pottery as a substitute and they may have used crushed tiles for this purpose before discovering natural sources near Rome. The huge dome of the Pantheon in Rome and the massive Baths of Caracalla are examples of ancient structures made from these concretes, many of which are still standing. The vast system of Roman aqueducts also made extensive use of hydraulic cement.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pozzolanas</b> such as Santorin earth {{were used}} in the Eastern Mediterranean since 500-400 BC.

Vitruvius speaks of four types of pozzolana: black, white, grey, and red, all of which {{can be found in the}} volcanic areas of Italy, such as Naples. Typically it was very thoroughly mixed two-to-one with lime just prior to mixing with water. The Roman port at Cosa was built of pozzolana-lime concrete that was poured underwater, apparently using a long tube to carefully lay it up without allowing sea water to mix with it. The three piers are still visible today, with the underwater portions in generally excellent condition even after more than 2100 years.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s Italy {{was a major}} {{producer}} of pyrites (from the Tuscan Maremma), asbestos (from the Balangero mines), fluorite (found in Sicily), and salt.

500|$|The shallow {{coffering}} in {{the dome}} {{accounts for a}} less than five percent reduction in the dome's mass, and is mostly decorative. The aggregate material hand-placed in the concrete is heaviest {{at the base of}} the dome and changes to lighter materials as the height increases, dramatically reducing the stresses in the finished structure. In fact, many commentators have cited the Pantheon as an example of the revolutionary possibilities for monolithic architecture provided by the use of Roman <b>pozzolana</b> concrete. However, vertical cracks seem to have developed very early, such that in practice the dome acts as an array of arches with a common keystone, rather than as a single unit. The exterior step-rings used to compress the [...] "haunches" [...] of the dome, which would not be necessary if the dome acted as a monolithic structure, may be an acknowledgement of this by the builders themselves. Such buttressing was common in Roman arch construction. The cracks in the dome can be seen from the upper internal chambers of the rotunda, but have been covered by re-rendering on the inner surface and by patching on the outside. The Pantheon's roof was originally covered with gilt bronze tiles, but these were removed in 663 by Emperor Constans II and replaced with lead roofing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Fine Grained Mortar (FGM) {{offers a}} new {{innovative}} technology binder system to strengthen or repair concrete structures. The innovative technique is achieved by using a small maximum grain size of 1 mm for the mortars. Therefore, less than 2 mm of mortar thickness would be fitted between the strengthened layers. FGM also has high binder contents, by adopting different pozzolanic additives and high performance of plasticizers. Recently, the utilisation of supplementary of cementing materials such as Fly Ash (FA) and Rice Husk Ash (RHA) has a become an important in concrete industry.

The required water of standard consistency and setting times were measured as well as physico-chemical and mechanical characteristics of the hardened cement pastes were investigated. Some selected cement pastes were tested by TGA, DTA and FT-IR techniques to investigate the variation of hydrated products of blended cements. The pozzolanic activity of SF is higher than GCB and WCS. The higher activity of SF is mainly due to its higher surface area {{than the other two}} pozzolanic materials. On the other side, GCB is more pozzolanic than WCS due to GCB containing crystalline silica quartz in addition to an amorphous phase. The silica quartz acts as nucleating agents which accelerate the rate of hydration in addition to its amorphous phase, which can react with liberating Ca(OH) 2 forming additional hydration products...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} to relate the {{mechanical}} and durability properties of high performance metakaolin (MK) and silica fume concretes to their microstructure characteristics. The compressive strength and chloride penetrability of the control and the concretes incorporated with MK or silica fume (SF) at water-to-binder (w/b) ratios of 0. 3 and 0. 5 are determined. The pore size distribution and porosity of the concretes are also measured. The effect of MK and SF on the interfacial porosity is discussed based on test results. It is found that MK concrete has superior strength development and similar chloride resistance to SF concrete, and the MK concrete at a w/b of 0. 3 has a lower porosity and smaller pore sizes than the control (plain) concrete. The resistance of the concretes to chloride ion penetration correlates better with the measured concrete porosity than with the paste porosity. The differences between the measured and calculated concrete porosity is smaller for MK and SF incorporated concrete than for the control concrete, indicating an improvement in the interfacial microstructure with the incorporation of the <b>pozzolanas.</b> This difference {{is found to be}} related to the strength and chloride penetrability of concrete to some degree.

The abundance {{of these materials}} in West-Africa paved way for this study. The effect of partial substitution of cement with an agricultural waste-DDCPA on the compressive strength of Laterized concrete (LATCON) was investigated. Results of the physical and chemical tests on DDCPA and Laterite revealed them to have satisfactory characteristic properties for concrete production. A total of 48 cubic specimens of 100 mm dimensions were cast and cured by complete submergence in water for 56, 90, 120 and 150 -days hydration period, adopting a 28 -day targeted strength of 25 MPa as control. The cement/DDCPA and sand/laterite replacements ratios ranged from 0 to 30 %, {{with a view to}} determining the best compositions matrix. The density and compressive strength properties decreased with increase in DDCPA and laterite content. However, a gradual strength development in the DDCPA-LATCON was observed as the curing age increased. Hence, the 150 -days density and compressive strength of the normal concrete was 2373 Kg/m 3 and 73. 57 MPa while the 10 %DDCPA+ 10 %Laterite sample (i. e. best replacements matrix) had 2310 Kg/m 3 and 75. 64 MPa respectively. The strength of the DDCPA-LATCON (75. 64 MPa) was higher than the strength of the control sample (73. 57 MPa) at the 150 -day, which makes it suitable as a construction material and proves that <b>pozzolanas</b> can produce concrete with close characteristics as normal concrete beyond age 28 -days. As such, it can be adopted in the construction of simple foundations and masonry units as reliable alternatives to the scarce and expensive conventional materials for prime cost reduction in rural housing and development without compromising standards. In developing countries the generation of supplementary cementitiou...|$|R
