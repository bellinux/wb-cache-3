Mining {{companies}} {{intend to}} solve the problem of <b>waste</b> <b>dump</b> and reduce the production cost by dumping a large number of waste soils to cover slope outside the running tailings. Therefore, in order to discuss the safety of <b>waste</b> <b>dump</b> slope covering in front of the tailings dam, numerical method was adopted to study the seepage-line change law, the pore water pressure and anti-sliding safety before and after the <b>waste</b> <b>dump</b> covering out of tailings dam. The researches show that the key to waste-dump slope safety are the drainage performance of <b>waste</b> <b>dump</b> bottom layer and the anti-sliding safety of <b>waste</b> <b>dump</b> soil. The appropriate <b>waste</b> <b>dump</b> slope work can improves the tailings dam’s safety and solves the <b>waste</b> <b>dump</b> problem in mining production...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the abundance of}} reptile and mammal species on five rehabilitated <b>waste</b> <b>dumps</b> in the early successional stages in the mined area around Ora Banda in Western Australia and compared these data with species richness and abundance in adjacent undisturbed areas. Mammal species common in the undisturbed areas were also found in relatively high abundance on <b>waste</b> <b>dumps,</b> {{with the exception of}} Pseudomys hermannsburgensis. In contrast, not all reptile species in the adjacent undisturbed areas had colonized <b>waste</b> <b>dumps.</b> However, a high proportion of those reptile species that were caught on rehabilitated <b>waste</b> <b>dumps</b> were at lower numbers than in the adjacent undisturbed areas, indicating that they were slow colonizers. Reptiles Underwoodisaurus milii, Heteronotia binoei and Pogona minor and mammals Mus musculus and Sminthopsis crassicauda are among the early colonizing species that flourish in the developing ecosystem on <b>waste</b> <b>dumps.</b> Species able to exploit a diverse range of niches, tolerate open spaces, have a generalist diet and good dispersal capabilities are the early colonizers. In contrast, species with a specialist diet or micro-habitat requirements are slow to colonize rehabilitated <b>waste</b> <b>dumps</b> and will initially be represented in low numbers. We encourage mining companies and regulators to change {{the size and shape of}} <b>waste</b> <b>dumps,</b> and to seed with species found in the adjacent undisturbed areas to hasten the colonization of vertebrate species on to <b>waste</b> <b>dumps</b> and the creation of functional ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|The slope {{stability}} of mine <b>waste</b> <b>dumps</b> {{is controlled by}} the shear strength of mining wastes which are mostly rockfill materials. Triaxial tests and direct shear tests were conducted to investigate the shear strength of a phyllite rockfill material from a mine <b>waste</b> <b>dump.</b> The behavior of the rockfill material is investigated from low to high confining pressures. The effect of soaking in acid tailings water on the shear strength of the rockfill material is studied. Particle breakage of the rockfill material increases with confining pressure. The increasing rate decreases as the confining pressure increases. An empirical equation is proposed to describe the breakage of the rockfill material. The strength of the rockfill material soaked in acid tailings water decreases with the soaking time. A new empirical strength criterion is proposed that can describe the strength change with confining pressure and particle breakage. Using the proposed strength criterion, the {{slope stability}} of the Xiyuan <b>waste</b> <b>dump,</b> the toe of which is soaked in the tailings pond, is analyzed using the Bishop method. The results show that both particle breakage and acid water damage decrease the slope stability of the mine <b>waste</b> <b>dump.</b> The analysis results also explain the appearance of cracks and settlements on the mine <b>waste</b> <b>dump.</b> The slope stability analysis of the Xiyuan <b>waste</b> <b>dump</b> indicates that the proposed strength criterion is reasonable for describing the strength of rockfill materials from low to high confining pressure. It is found that the effect of acid tailings water on the shear strength of rockfill material and the stability of the mine <b>waste</b> <b>dump</b> slope cannot be ignored.

The potential ability of dump slide material to filter suspended sediment from influent water is discussed and questions are raised regarding the amount of sediment generated by <b>waste</b> <b>dumps.</b> This paper presents data and theoretical arguments supporting the following claims: 1. That dump slide material filters suspended sediment- supported by:- Experience at an east Kootenay mine showing a dramatic decrease in sediment loads subsequent to a failure. - Experience at Quintette Coal Limited indicating that solids concentrations below the Mesa dump slide are less than upstream concentrations in 49 % of samples taken and of the same concentration in 30 %. Slight increases downstream are seen in 21 % of the data set. - Dye observations indicating that an approximate retention time in the slide mass is 69 hours. 2.
