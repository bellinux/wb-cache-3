5|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>transcript</b> RNAs {{are often}} {{modified}} by enzymes after transcription. For example, a poly(A) tail and a 5' cap {{are added to}} eukaryotic pre-mRNA and introns are removed by the spliceosome.|$|E
5|$|Transcription is {{the process}} by which the {{information}} contained in a section of DNA is replicated {{in the form of a}} newly assembled piece of messenger RNA (mRNA). Enzymes facilitating the process include RNA polymerase and transcription factors. In eukaryotic cells the <b>primary</b> <b>transcript</b> is pre-mRNA. Pre-mRNA must be processed for translation to proceed. Processing includes the addition of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail to the pre-mRNA chain, followed by splicing. Alternative splicing occurs when appropriate, increasing the diversity of the proteins that any single mRNA can produce. The product of the entire transcription process (that began with the production of the pre-mRNA chain) is a mature mRNA chain.|$|E
5|$|In prokaryotes, {{transcription}} {{occurs in}} the cytoplasm; for very long transcripts, translation may begin at the 5'end of the RNA while the 3'end is still being transcribed. In eukaryotes, transcription {{occurs in the}} nucleus, where the cell's DNA is stored. The RNA molecule produced by the polymerase {{is known as the}} <b>primary</b> <b>transcript</b> and undergoes post-transcriptional modifications before being exported to the cytoplasm for translation. One of the modifications performed is the splicing of introns which are sequences in the transcribed region that do not encode protein. Alternative splicing mechanisms can result in mature transcripts from the same gene having different sequences and thus coding for different proteins. This is a major form of regulation in eukaryotic cells and also occurs in some prokaryotes.|$|E

50|$|Transcription, {{a highly}} {{regulated}} phase in gene expression, produces <b>primary</b> <b>transcripts.</b> However, transcription {{is only the}} first step which should be followed by many modifications that yield functional forms of RNAs. Otherwise stated, the newly synthesized <b>primary</b> <b>transcripts</b> are modified in several ways to be converted to their mature, functional forms to produce different proteins and RNAs such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.|$|R
5|$|Octopuses {{and other}} coleoid {{cephalopods}} {{are capable of}} greater RNA editing (which involves changes to the nucleic acid sequence of the <b>primary</b> <b>transcript</b> of RNA molecules) than any other organisms. Editing is concentrated in the nervous system and affects proteins involved in neural excitability and neuronal morphology. More than 60% of RNA transcripts for coleoid brains are recoded by editing, compared to less than 1% for a human or fruit fly. Coleoids rely mostly on ADAR enzymes for RNA editing, which requires large double-stranded RNA structures to flank to the editing sites. Both the structures and editing sites are conserved in the coleoid genome and the mutation rates for the sites are severely hampered. Hence, greater transcriptome plasticity has come {{as the cost of}} slower genome evolution. High levels of RNA editing {{do not appear to be}} present in more basal cephalopods or other molluscs.|$|E
5|$|Proteins are {{assembled}} from {{amino acids}} using information encoded in genes. Each protein {{has its own}} unique amino acid sequence that is specified by the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding this protein. The genetic code {{is a set of}} three-nucleotide sets called codons and each three-nucleotide combination designates an amino acid, for example AUG (adenine-uracil-guanine) is the code for methionine. Because DNA contains four nucleotides, the total number of possible codons is 64; hence, there is some redundancy in the genetic code, with some amino acids specified by more than one codon. Genes encoded in DNA are first transcribed into pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) by proteins such as RNA polymerase. Most organisms then process the pre-mRNA (also known as a <b>primary</b> <b>transcript)</b> using various forms of Post-transcriptional modification to form the mature mRNA, which is then used as a template for protein synthesis by the ribosome. In prokaryotes the mRNA may either be used as soon as it is produced, or be bound by a ribosome after having moved away from the nucleoid. In contrast, eukaryotes make mRNA in the cell nucleus and then translocate it across the nuclear membrane into the cytoplasm, where protein synthesis then takes place. The rate of protein synthesis is higher in prokaryotes than eukaryotes and can reach up to 20 amino acids per second.|$|E
25|$|Exon {{skipping}} or cassette exon: in this case, an exon may be spliced {{out of the}} <b>primary</b> <b>transcript</b> or retained. This is {{the most}} common mode in mammalian pre-mRNAs.|$|E
40|$|Processing of miRNAs occurs {{simultaneous}} {{with the}} transcription and splicing of their <b>primary</b> <b>transcripts.</b> For the small subset of exonic miRNAs {{it is unclear}} if the unspliced and/or spliced transcripts are used for miRNA biogenesis. We assessed endogenous levels and cellular location of <b>primary</b> <b>transcripts</b> of three exonic miRNAs. The ratio between unspliced and spliced transcripts varied markedly, i. e. > 1 for BIC,...|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} factors {{contribute}} to the activation and inhibition of transcription and therefore regulate the production of <b>primary</b> <b>transcripts</b> from a given DNA template.|$|R
25|$|While {{transcription}} of prokaryotic protein-coding genes creates messenger RNA (mRNA) that {{is ready}} for translation into protein, transcription of eukaryotic genes leaves a <b>primary</b> <b>transcript</b> of RNA (pre-mRNA), which first has to undergo a series of modifications to become a mature mRNA.|$|E
25|$|In animal mitochondria, each DNA strand is {{transcribed}} continuously {{and produces}} a polycistronic RNA molecule. Between most (but not all) protein-coding regions, tRNAs are present (see the human mitochondrial genome map). During transcription, the tRNAs acquire their characteristic L-shape that gets recognized and cleaved by specific enzymes. With the mitochondrial RNA processing, individual mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA sequences are {{released from the}} <b>primary</b> <b>transcript.</b> Folded tRNAs therefore act as secondary structure punctuations.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, {{the first}} example of {{alternative}} splicing in a transcript from a normal, endogenous gene was characterized. The gene encoding the thyroid hormone calcitonin {{was found to be}} alternatively spliced in mammalian cells. The <b>primary</b> <b>transcript</b> from this gene contains 6 exons; the calcitonin mRNA contains exons 1–4, and terminates after a polyadenylation site in exon 4. Another mRNA is produced from this pre-mRNA by skipping exon 4, and includes exons 1–3, 5, and 6. It encodes a protein known as CGRP (calcitonin gene related peptide). Examples of alternative splicing in immunoglobin gene transcripts in mammals were also observed in the early 1980s.|$|E
40|$|Members of the microRNA (miRNA) {{class of}} 22 -nucleotide RNAs {{regulate}} {{the expression of}} target genes that contain sequences of antisense complementarity. Maturation of miRNAs involves cleavage of longer <b>primary</b> <b>transcripts,</b> but little is yet understood about how miRNA genes are transcribed and enter the processing pathway. We find that relatively long, polyadenylated transcripts encoded by the Caenorhabditis elegans let- 7 gene undergo trans-splicing to the spliced leader 1 (SL 1) RNA. Deletions, including removal of the trans-splice site, upstream of mature let- 7 sequence result in stable accumulation of <b>primary</b> <b>transcripts</b> and compromised production of mature let- 7 RNA in vivo. Our data show that multiple steps of let- 7 miRNA biogenesis can be uncoupled, allowing for complex regulation {{in the production of}} a functional miRNA. Finally, the observation that let- 7 <b>primary</b> <b>transcripts</b> undergo splicing highlights the importance of identifying the sequence of endogenous pri-miRNA substrates recognized by the cellular processing machinery...|$|R
5000|$|During capping, a 7-methylguanosine residue is {{attached}} to the 5'-terminal end of the <b>primary</b> <b>transcripts.</b> This is otherwise known as the GTP or 5' Cap, and is used for the stability and attachment point for ribosomes.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the levels}} of mature let-7 members are {{undetectable}} in undifferentiated cells, the <b>primary</b> <b>transcripts</b> and the hairpin precursors of let-7 are present in these cells. It indicates that the mature let-7 miRNAs may be regulated in a post-transcriptional manner.|$|R
25|$|Alignment of <b>primary</b> <b>transcript</b> mRNA {{sequences}} {{derived from}} eukaryotes to a reference genome requires specialised handling of intron sequences, which are absent from mature mRNA. Short read aligners perform an additional round of alignments {{specifically designed to}} identify splice junctions, informed by canonical splice site sequences and known intron splice site information. Identification of intron splice junctions prevents reads being misaligned across splice junctions or erroneously discarded, allowing more reads to be aligned to the reference genome and improving the accuracy of gene expression estimates. Since gene regulation may occur at the mRNA isoform level, splice-aware alignments also permit detection of isoform abundance changes {{that would otherwise be}} lost in a bulked analysis.|$|E
25|$|Pre-mRNAs of the Transformer (Tra) gene of Drosophila melanogaster undergo {{alternative}} splicing via the alternative acceptor site mode. The gene Tra encodes a protein that is expressed only in females. The <b>primary</b> <b>transcript</b> of this gene contains an intron with two possible acceptor sites. In males, the upstream acceptor site is used. This causes a longer version of exon 2 {{to be included}} in the processed transcript, including an early stop codon. The resulting mRNA encodes a truncated protein product that is inactive. Females produce the master sex determination protein Sex lethal (Sxl). The Sxl protein is a splicing repressor that binds to an ISS in the RNA of the Tra transcript near the upstream acceptor site, preventing U2AF protein from binding to the polypyrimidine tract. This prevents the use of this junction, shifting the spliceosome binding to the downstream acceptor site. Splicing at this point bypasses the stop codon, which is excised as part of the intron. The resulting mRNA encodes an active Tra protein, which itself is a regulator of {{alternative splicing}} of other sex-related genes (see dsx above).|$|E
500|$|When the RNA is cleaved, {{polyadenylation}} starts, catalysed by polyadenylate polymerase. Polyadenylate polymerase {{builds the}} poly(A) tail by adding adenosine monophosphate units from adenosine triphosphate to the RNA, cleaving off pyrophosphate. Another protein, PAB2, binds to the new, short poly(A) tail {{and increases the}} affinity of polyadenylate polymerase for the RNA. When the poly(A) tail is approximately 250 nucleotides long the enzyme can no longer bind to CPSF and polyadenylation stops, thus determining {{the length of the}} poly(A) tail. CPSF is in contact with RNA polymerase II, allowing it to signal the polymerase to terminate transcription. When RNA polymerase II reaches a [...] "termination sequence" [...] (TTATTT on the DNA template and AAUAAA on the <b>primary</b> <b>transcript),</b> the end of transcription is signaled. The polyadenylation machinery is also physically linked to the spliceosome, a complex that removes introns from RNAs.|$|E
40|$|Antennapedia (Antp) is a Drosophila {{homeotic}} gene that controls differentiation of the thoracic segments. Antp transcripts are produced from either of two promoters that are independently regulated in temporally and spatially distinct patterns. In addition, Antp transcripts utilize either {{of two major}} polyadenylation sites. Antp <b>primary</b> <b>transcripts</b> contain the same protein coding sequences. Alternative RNA splicing at two positions within the <b>primary</b> <b>transcripts</b> produces mRNAs that can encode four slightly different Antp proteins. Different classes of alternatively spliced transcript predominate early and late in Drosophila development, indicating that the Antp gene is regulated by the processing of its transcripts {{as well as by}} controlling their transcription. Alternative splicing appears to be independent of which promoter and which polyadenylation site is used...|$|R

50|$|The CD45 family {{consists}} of multiple members {{that are all}} products of a single complex gene. This gene contains 34 exons and three exons of the <b>primary</b> <b>transcripts</b> are alternatively spliced to generate up to eight different mature mRNAs and after translation eight different protein products. These three exons generate the RA, RB and RC isoforms.|$|R
500|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are genomically encoded non-coding RNAs {{that help}} {{regulate}} gene expression, particularly during development. The phenomenon of RNA interference, broadly defined, includes the endogenously induced gene silencing effects of miRNAs {{as well as}} silencing triggered by foreign dsRNA. Mature miRNAs are structurally similar to siRNAs produced from exogenous dsRNA, but before reaching maturity, miRNAs must first undergo extensive post-transcriptional modification. A miRNA is expressed from a much longer RNA-coding gene as a <b>primary</b> <b>transcript</b> known as a pri-miRNA which is processed, in the cell nucleus, to a 70-nucleotide stem-loop structure called a pre-miRNA by the microprocessor complex. This complex consists of an RNase III enzyme called Drosha and a dsRNA-binding protein DGCR8. The dsRNA portion of this pre-miRNA is bound and cleaved by Dicer to produce the mature miRNA molecule that can {{be integrated into the}} RISC complex; thus, miRNA and siRNA share the same downstream cellular machinery. First, viral encoded miRNA was described in EBV. Thereafter, an increasing number of microRNAs have been described in viruses.

2500|$|Both DNA and RNA are nucleic acids, {{which use}} base pairs of {{nucleotides}} as a complementary language. [...] During transcription, a DNA sequence is read by an RNA polymerase, which produces a complementary, antiparallel RNA strand called a <b>primary</b> <b>transcript.</b>|$|E
40|$|Splicing of <b>primary</b> <b>transcripts</b> is an {{essential}} process for the control of gene expression. Specific conserved sequences in premature transcripts are important to recruit the spliceosome machinery. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae catalytic spliceosome is composed of about 60 proteins and 5 snRNAs (U 1, U 2, U 4 /U 6 and U 5). Among these proteins, there are core components and regulatory factors, which might stabilize or facilitate splicing of specific substrates. Assembly of a catalytic complex depends on the dynamics of interactions between these proteins and RNAs. Cwc 24 p is {{an essential}} S. cerevisiae protein, originally identified {{as a component of}} the NTC complex, and later shown to affect splicing in vivo. In this work, we show that Cwc 24 p also affects splicing in vitro. We show that Cwc 24 p is important for the U 2 snRNP binding to <b>primary</b> <b>transcripts,</b> co-migrates with spliceosomes, and that it interacts with Brr 2 p. Additionally, we show that Cwc 24 p is important for the stable binding of Prp 19 p to the spliceosome. We propose a model in which Cwc 24 p is required for stabilizing the U 2 association with <b>primary</b> <b>transcripts,</b> and therefore, especially important for splicing of RNAs containing non- consensus branchpoint sequences.

The <b>primary</b> <b>transcript(s)</b> undergo various splicing events to produce two {{size classes of}} mRNA.

2500|$|Alternative {{splicing}} {{was first}} observed in 1977. The Adenovirus produces five primary transcripts early in its infectious cycle, prior to viral DNA replication, {{and an additional}} one later, after DNA replication begins. The early primary transcripts continue to be produced after DNA replication begins. The additional <b>primary</b> <b>transcript</b> produced late in infection is large and comes from 5/6 of the 32kb adenovirus genome. [...] This is much larger {{than any of the}} individual adenovirus mRNAs present in infected cells. Researchers found that the primary RNA transcript produced by adenovirus type 2 in the late phase was spliced in many different ways, resulting in mRNAs encoding different viral proteins. In addition, the <b>primary</b> <b>transcript</b> contained multiple polyadenylation sites, giving different 3’ ends for the processed mRNAs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{adenovirus}} {{life cycle}} is separated by the DNA replication process into two phases: an early and a late phase.

2500|$|The {{production}} of alternatively spliced mRNAs is regulated {{by a system}} of trans-acting proteins that bind to cis-acting sites on the <b>primary</b> <b>transcript</b> itself. Such proteins include splicing activators that promote the usage of a particular splice site, and splicing repressors that reduce the usage of a particular site. Mechanisms of alternative splicing are highly variable, and new examples are constantly being found, particularly {{through the use of}} high-throughput techniques. Researchers hope to fully elucidate the regulatory systems involved in splicing, so that alternative splicing products from a given gene under particular conditions ("splicing variants") could be predicted by a [...] "splicing code".|$|E
40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} a {{heterogeneous}} disease with a poorly defined genetic landscape, which poses a major challenge in diagnosis and treatment. By massively parallel mRNA sequencing, we obtained 1. 2 billion reads from 17 individual human tissues belonging to TNBC, Non-TNBC, and HER 2 -positive breast cancers and defined their comprehensive digital transcriptome for the first time. Surprisingly, we identified {{a high number of}} novel and unannotated transcripts, revealing the global breast cancer transcriptomic adaptations. Comparative transcriptomic analyses elucidated differentially expressed transcripts between the three breast cancer groups, identifying several new modulators of breast cancer.

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of small RNAs have been discovered in mammals. However, their <b>primary</b> <b>transcripts</b> and upstream regulatory networks remain largely to be determined. Genomic analysis of small RNAs facilitates identification of their <b>primary</b> <b>transcripts,</b> and hence contributes to researches of their upstream regulatory networks. We here report a batch platform, BatchGenAna, which is specifically designed for large-scale genomic analysis of mammalian small RNAs. It can map and annotate {{for as many as}} 1000 small RNAs or 10, 000 genomic loci of small RNAs at a time. It provides genomic features including RefSeq genes, mRNAs, ESTs and repeat elements in tabular and graphical results. It also allows extracting flanking sequences of submitted queries, specified genomic regions and host transcripts, which facilitates subsequent analysis such as scanning transcription factor binding sites in upstream sequences and poly(A) signals in downstream sequences. Besides small RNA fields, BatchGenAna can also be applied to other research fields, e. g. in silico analysis of target genes of transcription factors...|$|R
40|$|Biochemical {{fractionation}} procedures previously {{shown to}} remove 95 % of cellular protein, DNA, and phospholipid, were combined with fluorescence {{in situ hybridization}} to provide a critical evaluation of the retention and spatial preservation of specific <b>primary</b> <b>transcripts</b> within the chromatin-depleted nuclear substructure, operationally defined as the nuclear "matrix. " This unique approach made it possible to directly address whether nuclear extraction procedures preserve, create, or destroy ribonucleoprotein filament structures. Comparison of nuclei before and after fractionation demonstrated that localized foci or "tracks" of specific nRNA are unambiguously retained in the nuclear matrix preparation. Two well-characterized nuclear fractionation procedures were used and three Epstein-Barr virus-infected cell types investigated, including latently and permissively infected cells carrying integrated or episomal genomes. The EBV <b>primary</b> <b>transcripts</b> as well as nucleolar RNA were preserved within the remaining nuclear substructure with unambiguous spatial and quantitative fidelity. Image processing and quantitative microfluorimetry, together with [3 H]thymidine labeling of DNA, show that essentially 100 % of the RNA signal intensity remained after removal of 85 % of the DNA. That the native RNA distribution was unchanged was shown in other experiments in which the same individual nRNA tracks were examined before and after fractionation. Results conclusively demonstrate that the tight restriction of RNA to highly localized sites is independent of bulk DNA removal and of extensive extraction of proteins and phospholipids. Hence, this work provides direct visual evidence that the <b>primary</b> <b>transcripts</b> studied are localized via their binding to, or comprising part of, non-chromatin nuclear substructure...|$|R
