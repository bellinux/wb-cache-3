The structural {{characterization of the}} composites was carried out using various spectroscopic and electron microscopic techniques. From the thermal analysis of the composites, an improvement in the thermal properties was observed for the composites, {{as compared to the}} neat polymer. An increase in the DC conductivity was also observed in the composites, which was due to the tunneling of charge carriers. Furthermore, it was observed that the optimal loading of titania in the matrix was required, above which the properties of the composites showed deterioration.

40|$|CO 2 {{monitoring}} {{is important}} for many areas of high economic relevance, like environmental monitoring, control of biotechnological processes in bio-pharmaceutical industries, and the food industry, particularly controlled atmosphere storage rooms and modified atmosphere packaging []. CO 2 sensing is not a trivial area of research, as is testified by the increasing numbers of publications regarding this topic over the past decade. The main reason is that CO 2 chemically is relatively unreactive, and therefore finding a mechanism for signal generation is difficult. Most publications are based on its well-known acidic properties. In this communication, we present a portable optical sensor for gaseous CO 2 detection based on the phosphorescence intensity variation of a platinum octaethylporphyrin (PtOEP) complex trapped in oxygen-insensitive <b>poly(vinylidene</b> chloride-co-vinyl <b>chloride)</b> (PVCD) membranes. The sensing mechanism arises from the increasing displacement of the α-naphtholphthalein acid–base equilibrium with rising CO 2 concentrations []. The low-power LED-based optical sensing instrumentation for monitoring CO 2 {{is based on a}} pair of light emitting diodes (LEDs) arranged to face each other, wherein one LED functions as the light source and the other LED is reverse biased to function as a light detector []. A transparent polymer substrate coated on both sides with the CO 2 sensitive membrane placed between the two LEDs serves as a chemically responsive filter between the light source and the detector. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{differences}} between thermograms {{can be seen}} in the example of four different chloro-polymers: (a) polyvinyl chloride, (b) chlorinated polyvinyl chloride, (c) chlorinated rubber, and (d) <b>polyvinylidene</b> <b>chloride.</b> There are two stages of degradation in these four polymers. The first stage is the loss of hydrogen chloride, and is complete around 250 °C. This first step occurs at lower temperatures for the polymers containing more chlorine (chlorinated polyvinyl chloride, chlorinated rubber, and <b>polyvinylidene</b> <b>chloride),</b> implying that these chloride groupings are less stable than in polyvinyl chloride.|$|E
50|$|While {{extremely}} {{useful as}} a food packaging agent, the major disadvantage of <b>polyvinylidene</b> <b>chloride</b> {{is that it will}} undergo thermally induced dehydrochlorination at temperatures very near to processing temperatures. This degradation easily propagates, leaving polyene sequences long enough to absorb visible light, and change the color of the material from colorless to an undesirable transparent brown (unacceptable for one of <b>polyvinylidene</b> <b>chloride</b> chief applications: food packaging). Therefore, there is a significant amount of product loss in the manufacturing process, which increases production and consumer costs.|$|E

50|$|When {{formed into}} a thin plastic film, the {{principal}} advantages of <b>polyvinylidene</b> <b>chloride,</b> {{when compared to}} other plastics, are its ability to adhere to itself and its very low permeability to water vapor, flavor and aroma molecules, and oxygen.

50|$|As {{with many}} other alkenes, 1,1-DCE can be {{polymerised}} to form <b>polyvinylidene</b> <b>chloride.</b> A very widely used product, cling wrap, or Saran was made from this polymer.

Since 2004, therefore cling wrap's formulation has changed {{to a form of}} polyethylene.|$|E
50|$|<b>Polyvinylidene</b> <b>chloride</b> (PVDC) was {{discovered}} at Dow Chemical Company (Michigan, USA) in 1933 when a lab worker, Ralph Wiley, {{was having trouble}} washing beakers used in his process of developing a dry-cleaning product.

50|$|<b>Polyvinylidene</b> <b>chloride</b> {{is applied}} as a {{water-based}} coating to other plastic {{films such as}} biaxially-oriented polypropylene (BOPP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). This coating increases the barrier properties of the film, reducing the permeability of the film to oxygen and flavours and thus extending the shelf life of the food inside the package. It can also impart a high-gloss finish, which may be aesthetically pleasing and also provides {{a high degree of}} scuff resistance to if applied over print.|$|E
5000|$|S.C. Johnson Company, {{maker of}} {{household}} {{items such as}} Windex and Ziploc plastic bags was environmentally aware long before it became popular to be so.

50|$|In 1949, Dow {{introduced}} Saran Wrap, a thin, clingy {{plastic wrap}} that {{was sold in}} rolls and used primarily for wrapping food. It quickly became popular for preserving food items stored in the refrigerator. Saran Wrap was later acquired by S. C. Johnson & Son. However, today's Saran Wrap is no longer composed of PVDC, due to cost, processing difficulties, and environmental concerns with halogenated materials, and is now made from ordinary polyethylene. However, polyethylene has a higher oxygen permeability, which in turn affects food spoilage prevention. For example, at 23 °C and 95% relative humidity <b>polyvinylidene</b> <b>chloride</b> has an oxygen permeability of 0.6 cm3 μm m−2 d−1 kPa−1 while low-density polyethylene under the same conditions has an oxygen permeability of 2000 cm3 μm m−2 d−1 kPa−1.|$|E
5000|$|Chlorine donors. Used {{together}} with colorants. In some cases, the color emitting species is molecular and not atomic. Such {{is the case}} for blue pyrotechnic flames where the emitting species is copper monochloride. Also, some chloride molecular emitters are much stronger than oxides of the same element, {{as in the case of}} Barium and Strontium. Polyvinyl chloride, <b>polyvinylidene</b> <b>chloride,</b> Saran, chlorinated paraffins, chlorinated rubber (e.g. Parlon), hexachloroethane, hexachlorobenzene (most common chlorine donor until the 1970s, now rarely used), and some other organochlorides and inorganic chlorides (e.g. ammonium chloride, mercurous chloride) are used as chlorine donors. Perchlorates and chlorates play this role {{together with}} their main use as oxidizers. Chlorine donors are often used also in smoke compositions, e.g. hexachloroethane together with zinc oxide to produce smoke based on zinc chloride.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} shelf life {{enhanced}} by a vacuum bag {{is dependent on}} the structure in the material. A standard vacuum bag is composed of a PA/PE structure where PA is for puncture resistance and PE is for sealing. The high barrier category includes the usage of more layers focused on the prevention of oxygen permeability, and therefore shelf life protection. There are two materials used in high barrier structures, <b>polyvinylidene</b> <b>chloride</b> (PVDC) and ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH). Shelf life indication can be effectively measured by how many cubic centimeters of oxygen can permeate through 1 square meter of material over a 24-hour period. A standard PA/PE bag allows on average 100 cubic centimeters, PVDC allows on average over 10, and EVOH on average 1 cubic centimeter. Multi-layer structures allow the ability to use strong oxygen-barrier materials for enhanced shelf life protection. The PremiumPack structure {{is a good example of}} EVOH based high barrier shrink material.|$|E
50|$|Chlorinated {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} are generated by combustion of organic compounds. Cl-PAHs enter the environment from a multiplicity of sources and tend to persist in soil and in particulate matter in air. Environmental data and emission sources analysis for Cl-PAHs reveal that the dominant process of generation is by reaction of PAHs with chlorine in pyrosynthesis. Cl-PAHs have commonly been detected in tap water, fly ash from an incineration plant for radioactive waste, emissions from coal combustion and municipal waste incineration, automobile exhaust, snow, and urban air. They have also been detected in electronic wastes, workshop-floor dust, vegetation, and surface soil collected from the vicinity of an electronic waste (e-waste) recycling facility and in surface soil from a chemical industrial complex (comprising a coke-oven plant, a coal-fired power plant, and a chlor-alkali plant), and agricultural areas {{in central and eastern}} China. In addition, the combustion of polyvinylchloride and plastic wrap made from <b>polyvinylidene</b> <b>chloride</b> result in the production of Cl-PAHs, suggesting that combustion of organic materials including chlorine is a possible source of environmental pollution.|$|E
50|$|<b>Polyvinylidene</b> <b>chloride</b> or PVDC can be coated onto a PVC film {{to obtain}} very high {{moisture}} and oxygen barrier properties {{depending on the}} coating weight. PVDC coated blister films {{are the most common}} and prevailing barrier films used for pharmaceutical blister packs. PVDC coatings are also the most economical method for adding water barrier and oxygen barrier properties to a PVC film.PVDC blister films are available in 2 or 3 layer specifications referred to as duplex or triplex. Since the PVDC is applied by a coating process, the coating weight is expressed in grams per square meter (gsm). Duplex structures are typically PVC/PVDC films, ranging from 250µPVC/40gsmPVDC to 250µPVC/120gsmPVDC with WVTR from 0,65 to 0,25 g/m2/d and OTR from 1 to 0,1 cc/m2/d. For very deep draw thermoformed cavities, the triplex specifications are used : PVC/PE/PVDC, where the PE layer assists when forming deeper cavities. The PE (polyethylene) forms a soft intermediate layer between the rigid PVC and PVDC layers. Triplex specifications exists in similar coating weights as duplex specifications: 250µPVC/25µPE/40gsmPVDC up to 250µPVC/25µPE/120gsmPVDC.In order to obtain high barrier properties, PVDC is always applied using an emulsion coating process using a PVDC resin dispersed in water. The film producer applies the coating in several steps, drying-off the water between each coating station.|$|E

40|$|We present {{here the}} {{creation}} of a defect-free <b>polyvinylidene</b> <b>chloride</b> barrier layer on the lumen-side of a hollow fiber sorbent. Hollow fiber sorbents have previously been shown to be promising materials for enabling low-cost CO 2 capture, provided a defect-free lumen-side barrier layer can be created. Film experiments examined the effect of drying rate, latex age, substrate porosity (porous vs nonporous), and substrate hydrophobicity/ hydrophilicity. Film studies show that in ideal conditions (i. e., slow drying, fresh latex, and smooth nonporous substrate), a defect-free film can be formed, whereas the other permutations of the variables investigated led to defective films. These results were extended to hollow fiber sorbents, and despite using fresh latex and relatively slow drying conditions, a defective lumen-side layer resulted. XRD and DSC indicate that <b>polyvinylidene</b> <b>chloride</b> latex develops crystallinity over time, thereby inhibiting proper film formation as confirmed by SEM and gas permeation. This and other key additional challenges associated with the porous hollow fiber substrate vs the nonporous flat substrate were overcome. By employing a toluene-vapor saturated drying gas (a swelling solvent for <b>polyvinylidene</b> <b>chloride)</b> a defect-free lumen-side barrier layer was created, as investigated by gas and water vapor permeation. © 2011 American Chemical Society...|$|E
