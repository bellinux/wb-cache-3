5|$|The {{majority}} of insects hatch from eggs. The fertilization and development takes place inside the egg, enclosed by a shell (chorion) {{that consists of}} maternal tissue. In contrast to eggs of other arthropods, most insect eggs are drought resistant. This is because inside the chorion two additional membranes develop from embryonic tissue, the amnion and the serosa. This serosa secretes a cuticle rich in chitin that protects the embryo against desiccation. In Schizophora however the serosa does not develop, but these flies lay their eggs in damp places, such as rotting matter. Some species of insects, like the cockroach Blaptica dubia, as well as juvenile aphids and tsetse flies, are ovoviviparous. The eggs of ovoviviparous animals develop entirely inside the female, and then hatch immediately upon being laid. Some other species, {{such as those in}} the genus of cockroaches known as Diploptera, are viviparous, and thus gestate inside the mother and are born alive. Some insects, like parasitic wasps, show <b>polyembryony,</b> where a single fertilized egg divides into many and in some cases thousands of separate embryos. Insects may be univoltine, bivoltine or multivoltine, i.e. they may have one, two or many broods (generations) in a year.|$|E

50|$|The genus Citrus has {{a number}} of species that undergo <b>polyembryony,</b> where {{multiple}} nuclear-derived embryos exist alongside sexually-derived embryos. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek first described <b>polyembryony</b> in 1719 when the seed in Citrus was observed to have two germinating embryos. The genus Citrus includes a number fruit trees, such as orange, mandarin, and lemon. In Citrus, <b>polyembryony</b> is genetically controlled by a shared <b>polyembryony</b> locus among the species, determined by single-nucleotide polymorphism in the genotypes sequenced. The variation within the species of citrus is based on the amount of embryos that develop, the impact of the environment, and gene expression. As with other species, due to the many embryos developing in close proximity, competition occurs, which can cause variation in seed success or vigor.|$|E

5000|$|Polyembryony is the {{phenomenon}} of two or more embryos developing from a single fertilized egg. Due to the embryos resulting from the same egg, the embryos are identical to one another, but are genetically diverse from the parents. The genetic difference between the offspring and the parents, but the similarity among siblings, are significant distinctions between <b>polyembryony</b> {{and the process of}} budding and typical sexual reproduction. <b>Polyembryony</b> can occur in humans, resulting in identical twins, though the process is random and at a low frequency. <b>Polyembryony</b> occurs regularly in many species of vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants.|$|E

This development of identical quadruplets has been utilized {{as a tool for}} genetic research. [...] It is possible that the monozygotic <b>polyembryony</b> was an adaptation to accommodate for the female’s inability to carry more than one egg during the preimplantation stage.

5000|$|The term is {{also used}} in botany to {{describe}} the phenomenon of seedlings emerging from one embryo. Around 20 genera of gymnospores undergo <b>polyembryony,</b> termed [...] "cleavage polyembryony," [...] where the original zygote splits into many identical embryos. In some cases of plant species, the many embryos of <b>polyembryony</b> eventually gives rise to only a single offspring. The mechanism underlying the phenomenon of a resulting single (or in some cases a few) offspring is described in Pinus sylvestris to be programmed cell death (PCD), which removes all but one embryo. Originally, all embryos have equal opportunity to develop into full seeds, but {{during the early stages}} of development, one embryo becomes dominant through competition, and therefore the now dormant seed, while the other embryos are destroyed through PCD.|$|E
50|$|A more {{striking}} {{example of the}} use of <b>polyembryony</b> as a competitive reproductive tool is found in the parasitoid Hymenoptera, family Encyrtidae. The progeny of the splitting embryo develop into at least two forms, those that will develop into adults and those that become a type of soldier, called precocious larvae. These latter larvae patrol the host and kill any other parasitoids they find with the exception of their siblings, usually sisters.|$|E
50|$|Armadillos are {{the most}} well studied {{vertebrate}} that undergoes <b>polyembryony,</b> with six species of armadillo in the genus Dasypus that are always polyembryonic. The nine banded armadillo, for instance, always gives birth to four identical young. There are two conditions {{that are expected to}} promote the evolution of polyembryony: the mother does not know the environmental conditions of her offspring like {{in the case of a}} parasitiods, or a constraint on reproduction. It is thought that nine banded armadillos evolved to be polyembryonic because of the later.|$|E
50|$|<b>Polyembryony</b> is a {{widespread}} form of asexual reproduction in animals, whereby the fertilized egg or a later stage of embryonic development splits to form genetically identical clones. Within animals, this phenomenon has been best studied in the parasitic Hymenoptera. In the 9-banded armadillos, this process is obligatory and usually gives rise to genetically identical quadruplets. In other mammals, monozygotic twinning has no apparent genetic basis, though its occurrence is common. There are at least 10 million identical human twins and triplets in the world today.|$|E
50|$|Copidosoma floridanum is {{a species}} of wasp in the family Encyrtidae and is {{primarily}} a parasitoid of moths in the subfamily Plusiinae. It has the largest recorded brood of any parasitoidal insect, at 3,055 individuals. The life cycle begins when a female oviposits into the eggs of a suitable host species, laying one or two eggs per host. Each egg divides repeatedly and develops into a brood of multiple individuals, a phenomenon called <b>polyembryony.</b> The larvae grow inside their host, breaking free {{at the end of}} the hosts own larval stage.|$|E
50|$|Nucellar embryony (notated Nu+) {{is a form}} of seed {{reproduction}} {{that occurs}} in certain plant species, including many citrus varieties. During the development of seeds from plants that possess this genetic trait, the nucellar tissue which surrounds the megagametophyte can produce additional embryos (<b>polyembryony)</b> which are genetically identical to the parent plant. These nucellar seedlings are clones of the parent. By contrast, zygotic seedlings are sexually produced and inherit genetic material from both parents. Zygotic and nucellar embryos can occur in the same seed, and a zygotic embryo can divide to produce multiple embryos.|$|E
50|$|The nine-banded {{armadillo}} also serves science through its unusual reproductive system, in which four genetically identical offspring are born, {{the result of}} one original egg. Because they are always genetically identical, the group of four young provides a good subject for scientific, behavioral, or medical tests that need consistent biological and genetic makeup in the test subjects. This is the only reliable manifestation of <b>polyembryony</b> in the class Mammalia, and exists only within the genus Dasypus and not in all armadillos, as is commonly believed. Other species that display this trait include parasitoid wasps, certain flatworms, and various aquatic invertebrates.|$|E

40|$|<b>Polyembryony,</b> {{referring}} here {{to situations}} where a nucellar embryo is formed {{along with the}} zygotic embryo, has different consequences for the fitness of the maternal parent and offspring. We have developed genetic and inclusive fitness models to derive the conditions that permit the evolution of <b>polyembryony</b> under maternal and offspring control. We have also derived expressions for the optimal allocation (evolutionarily stable strategy, ESS) of resources between zygotic and nucellar embryos. It is seen that (i) <b>Polyembryony</b> can evolve more easily under maternal control than under that of either the offspring or the ‘selfish’ endosperm. Under maternal regulation, evolution of <b>polyembryony</b> can occur for any clutch size. Under offspring control <b>polyembryony</b> {{is more likely to}} evolve for high clutch sizes, and is unlikely for low clutch sizes (< 3). This conflict between mother and offspring decreases with increase in clutch size and favours the evolution of <b>polyembryony</b> at high clutch sizes, (ii) <b>Polyembryony</b> can evolve for values of “x” (the power of the function relating fitness to seed resource) greater than 0. 5758; the possibility of its occurrence increases with “x”, indicating that a more efficient conversion of resource into fitness favours <b>polyembryony.</b> (iii) Under both maternal parent and offspring control, the evolution of <b>polyembryony</b> becomes increasingly unlikely as the level of inbreeding increases, (iv) The proportion of resources allocated to the nucellar embryo at ESS is always higher than that which maximizes the rate of spread of the allele against a non-polyembryonic allele. Finally we argue that <b>polyembryony</b> is a maternal counter strategy to compensate for the loss in her fitness due to brood reduction caused by sibling rivalry. We support this assertion by two empirical evidences: (a) the extent of <b>polyembryony</b> is positively correlated with brood reduction inCitrus, and (b) species exhibiting <b>polyembryony</b> are more often those that frequently exhibit brood reduction. ...|$|E

40|$|Polyembryony-the {{production}} of multiple cloned embryos {{from a single}} fertilised egg-is a seemingly paradoxical combination of reproductive modes that nevertheless persists in diverse taxa. We document features of <b>polyembryony</b> in the Cyclostomata (Bryozoa) -an ancient order of modular colonial marine invertebrates-that suggest a substantial reduction in the paradoxical nature of this enigmatic reproductive mode. Firstly, we provide molecular evidence for <b>polyembryony</b> in three exemplar species, supporting the widely cited inference that <b>polyembryony</b> characterises the entire order. Secondly, genotyping demonstrates protracted release of cloned offspring from the primary embryo in a given gonozooid (chamber for embryonic incubation), thus exposing the same genotype to changing environmental conditions over time. Finally, we confirm that each gonozooid produces a distinct genotype, with each primary embryo being {{the result of a}} separate fertilisation event.
