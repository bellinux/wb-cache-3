25|$|<b>Psychoneuroimmunology</b> (PNI), also {{referred}} to as psychoendoneuroimmunology (PENI) or psychoneuroendocrinoimmunology (PNEI), is the study of the interaction between psychological processes and the nervous and immune systems of the human body.

25|$|At {{the systems}} level, the {{questions}} addressed in systems neuroscience include how neural circuits are formed and used anatomically and physiologically to produce {{functions such as}} reflexes, multisensory integration, motor coordination, circadian rhythms, emotional responses, learning, and memory. In other words, they address how these neural circuits function and the mechanisms through which behaviors are generated. For example, systems level analysis addresses questions concerning specific sensory and motor modalities: how does vision work? How do songbirds learn new songs and bats localize with ultrasound? How does the somatosensory system process tactile information? The related fields of neuroethology and neuropsychology {{address the question of}} how neural substrates underlie specific animal and human behaviors. Neuroendocrinology and <b>psychoneuroimmunology</b> examine interactions between the nervous system and the endocrine and immune systems, respectively. Despite many advancements, the way networks of neurons perform complex cognitive processes and behaviors is still poorly understood.|$|E

50|$|Immuno-psychiatry is a {{discipline}} that studies {{the connection between}} the brain the immune system.

50|$|Today, the {{philosophy}} that guides {{the concept of the}} healing environment is rooted in research in the neurosciences, environmental psychology, <b>psychoneuroimmunology,</b> and evolutionary biology.

50|$|The {{fundamental}} {{hypothesis of}} <b>psychoneuroimmunology</b> is concisely {{that the way}} people think and how they feel directly influences the electrochemistry {{of the brain and}} central nervous system, which in turn has a significant influence on the immune system and its capacity to defend the body against disease infection, and ill health. Meanwhile, the immune system affects brain chemistry and its electrical activity, which in turn has a considerable effect on the way we think and feel.|$|E

50|$|This is because, {{according}} {{to the principles of}} psychophysiology and <b>psychoneuroimmunology,</b> the way an individual perceives his or her mental and physical condition in turn affects biological processes, including susceptibility to illness, infection, or disease; and that perception is derived significantly from mental imagery. That is to say that in some cases, the severity of an individual's mental and physical disability, disorder, or illness is partially determined by his or her images, including their content, vividness or intensity, clarity, and frequency with which they are experienced as intrusive and unbidden.|$|E

5000|$|A key {{concept in}} Antonovsky's theory {{concerns}} how specific personal dispositions serve to make individuals more resilient to the stressors they encounter in daily life. Antonovsky identified these characteristics, which he claimed helped a person better cope (and remain healthy) by providing that person a [...] "sense of coherence" [...] {{about life and}} its challenges; Helen Antonovski (his wife) developed a scale ("Orientation to life questionnaire") in 1987 to measure it. Recent research in <b>psychoneuroimmunology</b> has supported the relationship between emotions and health contained in Antonovsky's theory. [...] Antonovsky died in 1994, but research using his theory continues by social scientists.|$|E
