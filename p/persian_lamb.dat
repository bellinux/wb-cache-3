2500|$|Shevlin {{continued}} {{assisting the}} Yale football team {{until the time}} of his death, and his colorful presence on the Yale sidelines was described as follows:"In that familiar heavy <b>Persian</b> <b>lamb</b> lined overcoat, wearing that familiar derby at that rakish angle, carrying that famous cane, with his horseshoe diamond pin in that flashy tie, and smoking that inevitable cigarette, he will run down the field with the varsity ends under kicks, and beat the youngsters in their togs every time. [...] Then he'll get excited, and dressed though he is in top form, will rush right into a scrimmage and show 'em how it should be done, no matter how muddy the field. [...] Practice over, Tom will go back to the Taft and order another suit. [...] He seems to have a new suit of clothes every day."In November 1915, Shevlin led Yale to a 13-7 win over Princeton in front of 50,000 fans at New Haven—the largest crowd ever to view a Yale-Princeton game. [...] After the game, Shevlin was haled as [...] "the miracle man of football" [...] who had [...] "saved Yale from the worst gridiorn defeat in her history." [...] Shevlin had been called east in October 1915 and was credited with having [...] "made order out of chaos" [...] in just two weeks training the Yale team.|$|E

60|$|Hot {{biscuits}} and coffee, with a chop {{or two of}} the delicious <b>Persian</b> <b>lamb</b> meat, put a less Spartan tinge on the morning, and gave Wallace and me more strength--we needed not incentive to leave the fire, hustle our saddles on the horses and get in line with our impatient leader. The hounds scampered over the frost, shoving their noses at the tufts of grass and bluebells. Lawson and Jim remained in camp; the rest of us trooped southwest.|$|E
60|$|Lawson rode in near sundown {{with the}} {{carcasses}} of two beasts of some species hanging over his saddle. It {{turned out that}} Jones had planned a surprise for Wallace and me, and it {{could hardly have been}} a more enjoyable one, considering the time and place. We knew he had a flock of Persian sheep on the south slope of Buckskin, but had no idea it was within striking distance of Oak. Lawson had that day hunted up the shepherd and his sheep, to return to us with two sixty-pound <b>Persian</b> <b>lambs.</b> We feasted at suppertime on meat which was sweet, juicy, very tender and of as rare a flavor as that of the Rocky Mountain sheep.|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} was begun in April 1973 {{to compare the}} performances of two groups of Blackhead Persian sheep: Group “A” and Group “B”. All the females in Group “A” are being upgraded to Dorper; Group “B” remains pure Blackhead <b>Persian.</b> The <b>lambing</b> percentege of both Group “A” (86 %) and Group “B”(60 %) was low but the lambing percentage of group “B” was unusually low. There was a difference in lambing distribution between Blackhead Persian and Dorper cross Blackhead <b>Persian</b> sheep. The <b>lambing</b> period of group “B” (22 days) was unexpectedly shorter than that of group “A” (34 days). The pretupping weight of the twin-giving ewes was slightly higher than the pretupping weight of the single giving ewes. The birth weights of Group”A” and Group “B” were 2. 6 kg and 2. 8 kg, respectively. The daily weight gain of both groups during the suckling period was similar i. e. 144 ± 24 and 148 ± 28 for Group ”A” and Group “B”, respectively...|$|R

60|$|Nancy {{you would}} call a shop-girl--because you have the habit. There is no type; but a perverse {{generation}} is always seeking a type; {{so this is what}} the type should be. She has the high-ratted pompadour, and the exaggerated straight-front. Her skirt is shoddy, but has the correct flare. No furs protect her against the bitter spring air, but she wears her short broadcloth jacket as jauntily as though it were <b>Persian</b> <b>lamb!</b> On her face and in her eyes, remorseless type-seeker, is the typical shop-girl expression. It is a look of silent but contemptuous revolt against cheated womanhood; of sad prophecy of the vengeance to come. When she laughs her loudest the look is still there. The same look {{can be seen in the}} eyes of Russian peasants; and those of us left will see it some day on Gabriel's face when he comes to blow us up. It is a look that should wither and abash man; but he has been known to smirk at it and offer flowers--with a string tied to them.|$|E

40|$|As {{the plot}} focuses on Henderson, our {{starting}} point wil be {{a presentation of}} his most important characteristics, so we can better understand the developing of the action. Henderson, {{at the age of}} fifty-five, is not a happy man. Although he has a nice wife and kids, plenty of money and time to enjoy life and its pleasures, he thinks he has made a mess of his life. Physically, he describes himself as "six feet four inches tall. Two hundred and thirty pounds - An enormous head, rugged, with hair like <b>Persian</b> <b>lamb's</b> fur. Suspicious eyes, usually narrowed. Blustering ways. A great nose" (p. 8). His appearance is, to say the least, remarkable. And he made it still more remarkable by the kind of clothes he liked to wear. He is a person who requires " large and real emotions" (p. 25) and that is why he was happy {{when he was in the}} war; /the civilian life bored him. Although he is always quarreling and many times "behaved like a bum", he wants to belong, to be accepted. On p. 256, when he's telling about one of his experiences with king Dahfu, what kind of words came instinctively from his mouth? "and certain words crept into my roars, like "God", "Help", "Lord Have Mercy" [...] . plus snatches from the Messiah (he was despised and rejected, a man of sorrows, etcetera". He feels there is a similarity between the Messiah and himself. Another aspect of his contradictory personality is the combination of sensitivity and a taste for hard manual work. The same hands that have"thrown down boars and pinned them and gelded them" (p. 32) also played the violin.

50|$|The modern cuisine was evolved {{during the}} Nizams in the mid-17th century, and {{elevated}} to a sublime art form.

40|$|A 148 days {{study was}} {{conducted}} at Morogoro to evaluate the mineral status of Blackhead <b>Persian</b> (BHP) <b>lambs</b> and their response to mineral supplementation under grazing conditions. Soil, forages and blood plasma were analysed monthly for Ca, Mg, P, K, Na, Cu, Fe and Zn. Also pH in soil and CP in forages were determined. Soil P, Cu and Zn, and forage CP, P, Na and Zn were in marginal levels to recommended requirements of lambs. Blood plasma P and Zn {{on the other hand}} were relatively high contrary to the low levels found in forages. Sex and mineral treatments did not have significant effect on blood plasm mineral composition. Mineral supplemented groups showed significant difference in final weight (P < 0. 05), and daily gain (P < 0. 01).

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of inclusion of Lablab meal on growth rate, feed intake and carcass composition of Black Head <b>Persian</b> (BHP) <b>lambs.</b> Twenty-four BHP castrate sheep with average weight of 14. 1 + 2. 7 kg were allotted randomly to four dietary treatments. Lambs were individually maintained in metabolic crates. All animals were offered hay ad libitum. Lambs on control treatment (A) were given in addition 380 g of maize bran per day. Animals on treatments B. C, and D were given daily 380 g of concentrate based on maize bran with 25, 50 and 75 % lablab meal, respectively. Growth rate, dry-matter intake and feed conversion ratio were 34, 66, 68, 71 g/day; 58. 7, 69. 5, 74. 0 g/kgW 0. 75 /day and 15. 2, 11. 3, 9. 3, 9. 1 g/DMI/g gain, respectively, of treatments A, B. C and D. The level of inclusion of lablab meal had no significant (P> 0. 05) effect on killing-out characteristics. Hot carcass weight as percentages of slaughter weight and empty body weight were 41. 3, 41. 0, 40. 5, 42. 5 and 52. 0, 52. 3, 53. 5, respectively, for animals on treatments A, B. C and D. Carcass composition expressed as percentage of carcass weight showed no significant treatment effects and value of 60. 91, 61. 29, 61. 11 and 62. 97 % for carcass lean, 19. 06, 20. 24, 18. 42 and 17. 54 % carcass fat and 17. 86, 16. 70, 17. 91 and 16. 67 % for carcass bone were obtained for treatments A, B.

50|$|A Victorian {{mourning}} cap {{was identified}} by its black colour or tone (depending {{on the level}} of mourning). The more recent the loss the simpler the design. The shape of the cap depended on the age of the widow but the most common was peaked at the front.Widows caps, were either lisse, tulle or tarlatan, shape depending mainly on the age. Young widows wore mainly the Marie Stuart shape, but all widows' caps had long streamers. Their prices were various. Tarlatan could be home-made, but widows did not like home-made widows' caps because even though economical, they were ruined quicker than bought caps. It was smart to buy extra streamers and bows for them as they could be used at home to make morning caps,excellent thread and needles being used for the work. In summer a parasol was required which had to be of silk deeply trimmed with crape, almost covered with it, but lace and fringe was not allowed in the first year. Later mourning fringe could be used. A muff, had to be made of dark fur or of <b>Persian</b> <b>lamb.</b>|$|E
50|$|Very {{young or}} even fetal Karakul lambs are prized for pelts. Newborn karakul sheep pelts are called karakul (also spelled caracul), swakara (coined from South West Africa Karakul), {{astrakhan}} (Russian), <b>Persian</b> <b>lamb,</b> agnello di Persia, (Italian), krimmer (Russian) and garaköli bagana (Turkmen). Sometimes the terms for newborn lambs' and fetal lambs' pelts are used interchangeably. The newborn lambs have a tight, curly pattern of hair. The lambs must be under three days old {{when they are}} killed, or they will lose their black color and soft, tightly wound coils of fur. Dark colors are dominant and lambs often darken in color as they age. Fetal karakul lamb pelts are called broadtail, Breitschwanz (German), and karakulcha. Fetal karakul lambs are harvested through miscarriages, induced early delivery or by killing the mother sheep and removing the fetus. Rather than killing healthy female sheep, farmers will kill older sheep that have already given birth many times. People use the lamb pelts to create various clothing items, such as The Astrakhan (hat) or karakul hat. The pelts have also been used in haute couture.|$|E
5000|$|The Canadian {{military}} fur wedge cap, [...] "envelope busby", or colloquially [...] "The Astrakhan" [...] is {{a uniform}} hat {{worn by the}} Canadian military and RCMP. The outside of the cap is entirely covered in real (e.g. seal skin or <b>Persian</b> <b>lamb)</b> or synthetic fur and is shaped like a wedge. When not being worn the cap folds flat. The cap is about 8 in high but is normally worn with {{the apex of the}} wedge shape depressed back into the interior of the cap to form a longitudinal trough at the crown, reducing the overall height. Often the cap is patterned such that the front of the crown will be slightly higher than the back. On one side of the military style fur wedge cap hangs a flat flap made of cloth or wool that extends from the crown {{to the bottom of the}} cap, known as the [...] "bag". The colour of the [...] "bag" [...] was determined by the regimental colours (e.g. the RCMP bag was yellow). The bag is very similar to that worn with the busby. Because of the cap's passing resemblance to the hussar busby author and researcher James J. Boulton dubbed it the envelope busby. Still, whatever influence the busby may have had on its design, the fur wedge cap pattern was [...] "distinctly Canadian" ...|$|E
5000|$|On several occasions, Shevlin also {{returned}} to Yale to help coach the school's football team {{during periods of}} difficulty.
