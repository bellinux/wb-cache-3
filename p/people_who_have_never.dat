5|$|The vast {{majority}} (85%) {{of cases of}} lung cancer are due to long-term tobacco smoking. About 10–15% of cases occur in <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> smoked. These cases are often caused {{by a combination of}} genetic factors and exposure to radon gas, asbestos, second-hand smoke, or other forms of air pollution. Lung cancer may be seen on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy which is usually performed by bronchoscopy or CT-guidance.|$|E

Another study considered a possible role of nicotine in reducing Parkinson's risk: nicotine stimulates the dopaminergic system of the brain, which is damaged in Parkinson's disease, while other compounds in tobacco smoke inhibit MAO-B, an enzyme which produces oxidative radicals by breaking down dopamine.|$|E

500|$|Another 1901 piece led {{to one of}} Mr. Dooley's {{most famous}} quotations. A number of {{lawsuits}} brought {{in the wake of}} the 1898 war dealt with the issue of whether the Constitution applied with full force in the former Spanish colonies annexed by the United States, none of which had been granted an organized government by Congress. This question was known as whether the Constitution follows the flag. In 1901, the United States Supreme Court decided these lawsuits, known as the Insular Cases. The justices' written opinions were difficult to understand, and the court deeply divided, but the net effect was to hold that the Constitution did not follow the flag. The decisions gave Mr. Dooley an opportunity to puncture the court's ivory-tower reputation, [...] "no matter whether the constitution follows the flag or not, the Supreme Court follows the election returns". The phrase has often been quoted, sometimes by <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> heard of Mr. Dooley.|$|E

[...] In a letter which David Large, in his book on the 1936 Games, terms [...] "heavy-handed", Brundage suggested that by helping to finance American participation in the Olympic Games, Jews could decrease anti-Semitism in the US.

500|$|IGNs Matt Casamassina {{said that}} the game {{compensated}} for its average graphics with excellent level design and gameplay challenges. He added that the game's puzzles require thought, unlike those in other action/platform games, and that the game's objectives were not clear until {{after the first few}} levels. Casamassina praised the game's transparency effects, anti-aliasing, mipmapping, and scaling rotations. IGN described anticipation for the game as [...] "tremendous", particularly among the game's market of [...] "younger gamers and 2D fans". Nintendo Power thought that the game was the best side-scroller since Super Mario World. Next Generation wrote that [...] "only diehard 2D platform fans" [...] would be interested and did not feel that the game lived up to standards set by Mario 64. In contrast, GameFan said that Mischief Makers did for 2D what Mario 64 did for 3D, and suggested that Sega should be influenced by the game. GamesRadar retrospectively called Mischief Makers [...] "pure, unadulterated awesome" [...] and [...] "2D brilliance". The website summarized the game to be about [...] "grabbing sad-faced aliens, shaking them until gems come out, and then hurling them at other sad-faced aliens." [...] Zachary Miller of Nintendo World Report asserted the game may be the console's most bizarre and surreal, but Gamasutra John Harris {{said that the}} game's premise is [...] "only strange to <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> heard of anime".

The music came from a talented band, not a DAT, and the bass lines to such songs as [...] "... Baby One More Time" [...] and [...] "The Beat Goes On" [...] rose to a funky growl in the live setting. For another, Spears' vocals were the real thing, as she sang in an alluringly low tone [...] but capably hit the high notes , however, she left the upper-octave duties to her background singers [...] during Spears' most strenuous dance routines". Richard Leiby of The Washington Post believed that the show [...] " [...] great". Dan Aquilante of the New York Post said that Spears [...] "seemed to be enjoying the show as much as her fans. Maybe it was the Mariah-like cowboy hat pushed back on her noggin or possibly the stripper's pole borrowed from Madonna's prop closet, [...] Spears was in her element and having a ball". Letta Tayler of Newsday said [...] "For half the show, she remained the old Britney, the budding teen who dreamed of romance.

On the basis of these data we estimate that 50 to 60 of the deaths from lung cancer in Canada in 1985 among <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> smoked were caused by spousal smoking; about 90 % occurred in women. The total number of deaths from lung cancer attributable to exposure to tobacco smoke from spouses and other sources (mainly the workplace) was derived by applying estimated age- and sex-specific rates of death from lung cancer attributable to such exposure to the population of Canadians <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> smoked; about 330 deaths from lung cancer annually are attributable to such exposure...|$|R
