The advantage of this method is: {{in the same time}} of the dynamic analysis of the the mechanics we can fulfill the design of the fly wheel. With this method, the <b>inertial</b> <b>moment</b> of fly wheel is determined precisely. In the traditional method, first we have to determine the <b>inertial</b> <b>moment</b> of fly wheel, then, make static-dynamic analysis of the mechanism and find out the react force of the connect pair. For example, after work, one first goes home and then has to go shopping. But if we choose not to go home directly, while on the way home in passing do some shopping then go home. Even though it is not the shortest way, but in total we can shave time and rod. It is the same occasion with our design method too. Even though the process of calculation is more complicated than the formal method, but we can determine the reaction on the connect pair at the same time.

40|$|International audienceThe {{functionalization}} of an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) cantilever with a colloidal bead is {{a widely}} used technique when the geometry between the probe and the sample must be controlled, particularly in force spectroscopy. But some questions remain: how does a bead glued {{at the end of}} a cantilever influence its mechanical response ? And more important for quantitative measurements, can we still determine the stiffness of the AFM probe with traditional techniques? In this article, the influence of a colloidal mass loading on the eigenmodes shape and resonant frequency is investigated by measuring the thermal noise on rectangular AFM microcantilevers with and without a bead attached at their extremities. The experiments are performed with a home-made ultra-sensitive AFM, based on differential interferometry. The focused beam from the interferometer probes the cantilever at different positions and the spatial shapes of the modes are determined up to the fifth resonance, without external excitation. The results clearly demonstrate that the first eigenmode almost doesn't change by mass loading. However the oscillation behavior of higher resonances present a marked difference: with a particle glued at its extremity, the nodes of the mode are displaced towards the free end of the cantilever. These results are compared to an analytical model taking into account the mass and the <b>inertial</b> <b>moment</b> of the load in an Euler-Bernoulli framework, where the normalization of the eigenmodes is explicitly worked out in order to allow a quantitative prediction of the thermal noise amplitude of each mode.

30|$|Development of {{parallel}} mechanism for high acceleration and high precision motions for industrial applications {{has been a}} focus of research {{for a long period}} of time. Wire mechanism has structure {{of parallel}} mechanism and it has been developed to produce high acceleration because of the small <b>inertial</b> <b>moment</b> of the top plate. For example, a high-speed manipulator using wire driven method called “FALCON” was proposed [1], which attained a peak acceleration of 43 G. The redundant drive concept was applied in a parallel mechanism to produce a large resultant force. In [2], a mechanism called “NINJA” was proposed; this was made light-weight by arranging the motors on a base. Its top plate with six degrees of freedom (DOF) was driven by four sub-arms with a parallel link structure. An optimum method was proposed to find the design parameters of the mechanism while reducing the inertia of the top plate. In experiments, the computation from encoders shows that NINJA can achieve an acceleration of ≥ 100 G. A high speed parallel mechanism for electronic part mounters, known as “constrained differential drive mechanism” (CDDM), was introduced [3]. In this research, a typical four DOFs pick-and-place motion was analyzed, and the trajectory was divided into two regions A and B. In region A, high precision motions were produced, whereas high acceleration motions were produced in region B. Thereafter, the virtual force redundancy (VFR) concept was introduced to the design of the high-speed parallel mechanism using CDDM. The experimental results showed that the mechanism could achieve an acceleration of ≥ 20 G. Recently, a mechanism known as “Capturing robot” which could achieve 100 G was introduced [4]. To achieve that high acceleration, spring energy was utilized in the pre-shaping dynamics of link fingers. However, this robot could only give high acceleration motion in one direction when moving to grasp object.|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of a link between asymmetrical Earth’s expansion and Polar Motions (PM) is investigated, searching for possible mechanisms of inner and/or surface material displacement, {{which can lead to}} the observed Chandler Wobble (CW; Eulerian free oscillation) and its secular drift. While the main result of this work is the identification of the possible cause of PM in the diffuse emplacement of new mass in and under the triple point zones, the prob-lem of the continuous excitation of the CW is still not resolved. Only a qualitative argument in favour of a cause of the CW’s excitation by the not uniformity in time (from short, tens of years, to long time scale), low frequency noise or pulsations, of the diapirical flow of mantle material is proposed. The inversion of paleogeography towards geo-dynamics is performed, and the result is found that the PM’s current parameters can be prolonged in the current ge-ological past up to 100 Myr, reproducing with satisfactory approximation the more reliable true polar wander path and its slowing down around 50 Myr, which was detected by Besse and Courtillot (1991, 2002). The very long pul-sation of the expansion rate – a fundamental new acquisition supporting a pulsating tectonic activity of the Earth (see the «Half Spreading Map of the Ocean Floors»; fig. 5. 19 in McElhinny and McFadden, 2000, based on Müller et al., 1997) – could be the cause of the modern undetectability {{of the effects of the}} Earth’s expansion on LOD and on ge-odesy. This is because of the minimum of the half spreading rate and tectonic activity occurring today – and the con-sequent minimum variation of radius and <b>inertial</b> <b>moment</b> –, and because the possible compensating effects due t...|$|R
