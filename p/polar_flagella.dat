40|$|SUMMARY: An {{organism}} with a {{new type}} of <b>polar</b> monotrichous <b>flagella</b> is described. The flagella have a very short wavelength which is very characteristic. The organism liquefies gelatin and oxidizes ethanol to acid. All other common differential tests were negative. The name Pseudornonas diminuta n. sp. is suggested. The curvature of bacterial flagella is quite constant and sufficiently charac-teristic to be of considerable taxonomic importance. The usual wavelength of the <b>flagella</b> of such <b>polar</b> monotrichous bacteria as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Vibrio comma is in the neighbourhood of 2 p. In a large collection of cultures of Gram-negative bacteria submitted to the authors for flagellar study by Robert Keller of the Museum of Natural History of Philadelphia were found three cultures which showed very unusual monotrichous flagella, having a wavelength of only slightly over 0. 6 ~. The cultures originated from fresh-water streams. Morphologically and physiologically the three cultures were identical and one description will apply to all. MORPHOLOGY OF ORGANIS...|$|R
40|$|By using mutants of Vibrio alginolyticus {{with only}} a polar {{flagellum}} (Pof+ Laf-) or only lateral flagella (Pof- Laf+), we {{examined the relationship between}} swimming speed and the viscosity of the medium for each flagellar system. Pof+ Laf- cells could not swim in the high-viscosity environment (ca. 200 cP) in which Pof- Laf+ cells swam at 20 microns/s. The Pof- Laf+ cells swam at about 20 microns/s at normal viscosity (1 cP) without the viscous agent, and the speed increased to 40 microns/s at about 5 cP and then decreased gradually as the viscosity was increased further. These results show the functional difference between <b>polar</b> and lateral <b>flagella</b> in viscous environments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Helicobacter pylori is the causative {{agent for}} gastritis, and peptic and {{duodenal}} ulcers. The bacterium displays 5 - 6 <b>polar</b> sheathed <b>flagella</b> {{that are essential}} for colonisation and persistence in the gastric mucosa. The biochemistry and genetics of flagellar biogenesis in H. pylori has not been fully elucidated. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that the gene HP 0256, annotated as hypothetical, was a FliJ homologue. In Salmonella, FliJ is a chaperone escort protein for FlgN and FliT, two proteins that themselves display chaperone activity for components of the hook, the rod and the filament. Results Ablation of the HP 0256 gene in H. pylori significantly reduced motility. However, flagellin and hook protein synthesis was not affected in the HP 0256 mutant. Transmission electron transmission microscopy revealed that the HP 0256 mutant cells displayed a normal flagellum configuration, suggesting that HP 0256 was not essential for assembly and polar localisation of the flagella in the cell. Interestingly, whole genome microarrays of an HP 0256 mutant revealed transcriptional changes {{in a number of}} genes associated with the flagellar regulon and the cell envelope, such as outer membrane proteins and adhesins. Consistent with the array data, lack of the HP 0256 gene significantly reduced adhesion and the inflammatory response in host cells. Conclusions We conclude that HP 0256 is not a functional counterpart of FliJ in H. pylori. However, it is required for full motility and it is involved, possibly indirectly, in expression of outer membrane proteins and adhesins involved in pathogenesis and adhesion. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{fragment}} of DNA was cloned which complemented a polar flagellum-defective (pof) mutation of Vibrio alginolyticus. The fragment contained two complete and two partial open reading frames (ORFs) (ORF 2 and- 3 and ORF 1 and- 4, respectively). The presumed product of ORF 2 has an {{amino acid sequence}} {{with a high degree}} of similarity to that of RpoN, which is an alternative sigma factor (s 54) for other microorganisms. The other ORFs are also homologous to the genes adjacent to other rpoN genes. Deletion analysis suggests that ORF 2 complements the pof mutation. These results demonstrate that RpoN is involved in the expression of polar flagellar genes. Many bacteria move by means of rotating flagella, located either peritrichously or at a pole on the cell body. Certain marine Vibrio species are unique in that they have two types of flagella: a single polar flagellum suited for swimming in a liquid environment and numerous lateral flagella suited for swarming over the surfaces of animate or inanimate objects (2, 4, 20, 24). In Vibrio parahaemolyticus and the closely related Vibrio algi-nolyticus, it has been shown that <b>polar</b> and lateral <b>flagella</b> ar...|$|R
