5|$|Sodium {{chloride}} is {{by a huge}} margin {{the most}} common chlorine compound, {{and it is the}} main source of chlorine and hydrochloric acid for the enormous chlorine-chemicals industry today. About 15000 chlorine-containing compounds are commercially traded, including such diverse compounds as chlorinated methanes and ethanes, vinyl chloride and its polymer polyvinyl chloride (PVC), aluminium trichloride for catalysis, the chlorides of magnesium, titanium, zirconium, and hafnium which are the <b>precursors</b> <b>for</b> producing the pure elements, and so on.|$|E

5|$|The <b>precursors</b> <b>for</b> systemin and AtPEP1 {{are both}} {{processed}} to yield one active peptide from the C-terminus of the precursor. It {{has been speculated}} that ProAtPEP1 is processed by CONSTITUTIVE DISEASE RESISTANCE 1, an apoplastic aspartic protease. The precursors to HypSys are processed into more than one active peptide. In tobacco, it is processed into two peptides, in petunia into three, and in sweet potato, possibly into six. At 291 amino acids long, the precursor to HypSys in sweet potato is the longest precursor described. The production of multiple signalling peptides from one precursor is a common feature found in animals.|$|E
5|$|Vitamins have diverse {{biochemical}} functions. Some, such as vitamin D, have hormone-like {{functions as}} regulators of mineral metabolism, or regulators of cell and tissue growth and differentiation (such as {{some forms of}} vitamin A). Others function as antioxidants (e.g., vitamin E and sometimes vitamin C). The largest number of vitamins, the B complex vitamins, function as enzyme cofactors (coenzymes) or the <b>precursors</b> <b>for</b> them; coenzymes help enzymes in their work as catalysts in metabolism. In this role, vitamins may be tightly bound to enzymes as part of prosthetic groups: For example, biotin is part of enzymes involved in making fatty acids. They may also be less tightly bound to enzyme catalysts as coenzymes, detachable molecules that function to carry chemical groups or electrons between molecules. For example, folic acid may carry methyl, formyl, and methylene groups in the cell. Although these roles in assisting enzyme-substrate reactions are vitamins' best-known function, the other vitamin functions are equally important.|$|E

25|$|Indole {{undergoes}} electrophilic substitution, mainly {{at position}} 3 (see diagram in right margin). Substituted indoles are structural elements of (and for some compounds, the synthetic <b>precursors</b> <b>for)</b> the tryptophan-derived tryptamine alkaloids like the neurotransmitter serotonin, and melatonin. Other indolic compounds include the plant hormone auxin (indolyl-3-acetic acid, IAA), tryptophol, the anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin, the betablocker pindolol, and the naturally occurring hallucinogen dimethyltryptamine.|$|E
25|$|These are the {{earliest}} multicellular organisms in Earth’s history, {{despite the fact}} that unicellularity had {{been around for a long}} time before that. The requirements for multicellularity were embedded in the genes of some of these cells, specifically choanoflagellates. These are thought to be the <b>precursors</b> <b>for</b> all multicellular organisms. They are highly related to sponges (Porifera), which are the simplest multicellular organisms.|$|E

25|$|Possible <b>precursors</b> <b>for</b> the {{evolution}} of protein synthesis include a mechanism to synthesize short peptide cofactors or form a mechanism for the duplication of RNA. It {{is likely that the}} ancestral ribosome was composed entirely of RNA, although some roles have since been taken over by proteins. Major remaining questions on this topic include identifying the selective force for {{the evolution}} of the ribosome and determining how the genetic code arose.|$|E
25|$|Tumor cells {{undergoing}} an EMT may be <b>precursors</b> <b>for</b> {{metastatic cancer}} cells, or even metastatic CSCs. In the invasive edge of pancreatic carcinoma, {{a subset of}} CD133+CXCR4+ (receptor for CXCL12 chemokine {{also known as a}} SDF1 ligand) cells was defined. These cells exhibited significantly stronger migratory activity than their counterpart CD133+CXCR4− cells, but both showed similar tumor development capacity. Moreover, inhibition of the CXCR4 receptor reduced metastatic potential without altering tumorigenic capacity.|$|E
25|$|The major uses of phenol, {{consuming}} {{two thirds}} of its production, involve its conversion to <b>precursors</b> <b>for</b> plastics. Condensation with acetone gives bisphenol-A, a key precursor to polycarbonates and epoxide resins. Condensation of phenol, alkylphenols, or diphenols with formaldehyde gives phenolic resins, a famous example of which is Bakelite. Partial hydrogenation of phenol gives cyclohexanone, a precursor to nylon. Nonionic detergents are produced by alkylation of phenol to give the alkylphenols, e.g., nonylphenol, which are then subjected to ethoxylation.|$|E

25|$|<b>Precursors</b> <b>for</b> the {{depiction}} of anthropomorphic animals were the works of Grandville who portrayed individuals for example in Les Métamorphoses du jour (1828–29) with the bodies of men and faces of animals. The caricatures of Charles Philipon {{can also be considered}} as a role model for the illustrators of Punch and other English satirical magazines. The cyclical depiction of Darwin's evolutionary theory might have been modelled on the wood engravings of the illustrator Charles H. Bennett which show transformations of humans into immobile objects and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Most seismologists reject Freund's {{suggestion}} that stress-generated signals {{can be detected}} and put to use as <b>precursors,</b> <b>for</b> a number of reasons. First, {{it is believed that}} stress does not accumulate rapidly before a major earthquake, and thus {{there is no reason to}} expect large currents to be rapidly generated. Secondly, seismologists have extensively searched for statistically reliable electrical precursors, using sophisticated instrumentation, and have not identified any such precursors. And thirdly, water in the earth's crust would cause any generated currents to be absorbed before reaching the surface.|$|E
25|$|Cosmic dust {{is widely}} present in space, where {{gas and dust}} clouds are primary <b>precursors</b> <b>for</b> {{planetary}} systems. The zodiacal light, as seen in a dark night sky, is produced by sunlight reflected from particles of dust in orbit around the Sun. The tails of comets are produced by emissions of dust and ionized gas {{from the body of}} the comet. Dust also covers solid planetary bodies, and vast dust storms occur on Mars that cover almost the entire planet. Interstellar dust is found between the stars, and high concentrations produce diffuse nebulae and reflection nebulae.|$|E

25|$|Secondary {{particles}} {{derive from}} the oxidation of primary gases such as sulfur and nitrogen oxides into sulfuric acid (liquid) and nitric acid (gaseous). The <b>precursors</b> <b>for</b> these aerosols—i.e. the gases from which they originate—may have an anthropogenic origin (from fossil fuel or coal combustion) and a natural biogenic origin. In the presence of ammonia, secondary aerosols often {{take the form of}} ammonium salts; i.e. ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate (both can be dry or in aqueous solution); in the absence of ammonia, secondary compounds take an acidic form as sulfuric acid (liquid aerosol droplets) and nitric acid (atmospheric gas), all of which may contribute to the health effects of particulates.|$|E
25|$|The {{hemolymph}} toxins {{originate from}} autogenous de novo biosynthesis by the Chrysomelina beetle. Essential amino acids as valine serve as <b>precursors</b> <b>for</b> {{the production of}} the hemolymph toxins of Chrysomelina leaf beetles. The degradation of such essential amino acids provides propanoyl-CoA. This compound is further transformed into propanoic acid and β-alanine. The amino group in β-alanine is then oxidized to yield either an oxime or the nitro-toxin 3-nitropropanoic acid (3-NPA). The oxime is cyclized to isoxazolin-5-one, which is transformed with α-UDP-glucose into the isoxazolin-5-one glucoside. In a final step, an ester is formed by transesterification of 3-nitropropanoyl-CoA to the 6´-position of isoxazolin-5-one glucoside. This biosynthetic route yields high millimolar concentrations of the secondary isoxazolin-5-one and 3-NPA derived metabolites. Free 3-NPA and glucosides that derive from 3-NPA and isoxazolin-5-one also occur in many genera of leguminous plants (Fabaceae).|$|E
25|$|Metabolism-like {{reactions}} {{could have}} occurred naturally in early oceans, {{before the first}} organisms evolved. Metabolism may predate the origin of life, which may have evolved from the chemical conditions in the earliest oceans. Reconstructions in laboratories show {{that some of these}} reactions can produce RNA, and some others resemble two essential reaction cascades of metabolism: glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, that provide essential <b>precursors</b> <b>for</b> nucleic acids, amino acids and lipids. A study at the University of Düsseldorf created phylogenic trees based upon 6 million genes from bacteria and archaea, and identified 355 protein families that were probably present in LUCA. They were based upon an anaerobic metabolism fixing carbon dioxide and nitrogen. It suggests that LUCA evolved in an environment rich in hydrogen, carbon dioxide and iron. Following are some observed discoveries and related hypotheses.|$|E
