40|$|Abstract — Surface {{temperature}} of a {{nozzle guide vane}} needs to be measured in order to ascertain the adequacy of cooling by conducting cooling effectiveness studies. However, before conducting cooling effectiveness tests it is recommended by international advisory group to conduct tests to calibrate the test cascade. Calibration of the test cascade essentially means mapping of the pressure distribution around the nozzle guide vane and comparing the pressure distribution with the design intent. Three airfoil shaped pressure probe were fabricated and the pressure distribution around the vanes were mapped. The results were also compared with design intent. Keywords—airfoil shaped pressure <b>probe,</b> <b>nozzle</b> guide vane, pressure distribution, Mach number distribution,. I...|$|E
40|$|Total {{temperature}} measurement in exhaust stream of air breathing engines like Ramjet, Scramjet and Aircraft afterburners is a challenging task as the temperatures in such engine exhausts are above 2200 K. Thermocouples for such high {{temperature measurement}} suffer from oxidation and are expensive. Optical method for this application requires {{high level of}} expertise and is expensive. Gasdynamic probe is a special type of water cooled probe and can give total temperature of the flow by measuring the flow parameters like total pressure and mass flow through the <b>probe</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The probe is very simple in construction and can be made at a low cost. This paper describes {{about the development of}} a Gasdynamic probe and calibration for probe constant for various flow parameter...|$|E

Mechanism operates by insertion of <b>probe</b> in <b>nozzle</b> of rocket motor on satellite, followed by expansion of inserted probe end to grasp motor inside nozzle and thereby capture satellite. Designed for specific satellite, but operating principle adapted to almost any satellite equipped with rocket motor or possibly used in retrieval of hollow-shaped objects in marine and other salvage operations...|$|R
40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} {{to determine the best}} <b>nozzle</b> and <b>probe</b> designs for new air sampling systems to be installed in the ventilation systems of some of the waste tanks at the Hanford Site in Richland, Washington. Isokinetic <b>nozzle</b> <b>probes</b> and shrouded probes were tested. The test aerosol was sodium-fluorescein-tagged oleic acid. The test parameters involved particle sizes from 1 to 15 {mu}m, air velocities from 3 to 15 m/s. The results of the tests show that shrouded probes can deliver samples with significantly less particle-size bias then the isokinetic <b>nozzle</b> <b>probes</b> tested. Tests were also conducted on two sample flow splitters to determine particle loss as a function of aerodynamic particle size. The particle size range covered in these tests was 5 to 15 {mu}m. The results showed little particle loss, but did show a bias in particle concentration between the two outlets of each splitter for the larger particle sizes...|$|R
40|$|The Mach {{number in}} the {{inviscid}} core of the flow exiting scarfed supersonic nozzles was measured using pitot <b>probes.</b> <b>Nozzle</b> characterization experiments were conducted in a modified section of an obsolete M = 7. 3 test section/nozzle assembly on Sandia's Hypersonic Wind Tunnel. By capitalizing on existing hardware, the cost and time required for tunnel modifications were significantly reduced. Repeatability of pitot pressure measurements was excellent, and instrumentation errors were reduced by optimizing the pressure range of the transducers used for each test run. Bias errors in probe position prevented us from performing a successful in situ calibration of probe angle effects using pitot probes placed {{at an angle to}} the nozzle centerline. The abrupt throat geometry used in the Baseline and Configuration A and B nozzles modeled the throat geometry of the flight vehicle's spin motor nozzles. Survey data indicates that small (''unmeasurable'') differences in the nozzle throat geometries produced measurable flow asymmetries and differences in the flow fields generated by supposedly identical nozzles. Therefore, data from the Baseline and Configuration A and B nozzles cannot be used for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code validation. Configuration C and D nozzles replaced the abrupt throat geometry of Baseline and Configuration A and B nozzles with a 0. 500 -inch streamwise radius of curvature in the throat region. This throat geometry eliminated the flow asymmetries, flow separation in the nozzle throat, and measurable differences between the flow fields from identical nozzles that were observed in Baseline/A/B nozzles. Data from Configuration C and D nozzles can be used for CFD code validation...|$|R
40|$|A virtual {{impactor}} {{has been}} characterized analytically to separate small (micro range) aerosol particles. In the current study, an approximate analytical expression relating to the collection efficiency and mean aerodynamic diameter of particles collected has been developed, Three sets of design parameters have been studied toinvestigate the effects of changes in solution concentration, collection <b>probe</b> diameter, <b>nozzle</b> diameter and {{the distance between them}} to the particle size and collection efficiency. Effects of major flows and minor flows have also been presented. It was found that, increasing solution concentration and decreasing the total flowrates, increased the particle mean diameter rapidly in the minor flow. But the interesting part is that, the particle mean diameter increased to a lesser extent as the rest parameters were increased...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the presented work is the numerical investigation of experiments {{for the study of}} nanoparticle producing laminar flames. Popular, state of the art numerical tools for the investigation of the detailed structure of laminar flames are based on strong assumptions, leading to one-dimensional, steady state approximations of the transport and conservation equations. Unfortunately, these assumptions are often violated. The main focus of this thesis is on the quantification of uncertainties and model errors introduced by thermodynamic and gas dynamic effects, geometric constraints of the reactor and invasive measurement technique in real experiments by means of detailed multi-dimensional numerical simulations of the particle forming, reacting flow. Five different experimental setups were investigated in close collaboration with the research groups conducting these experiments. First, the impact of a molecular beam sampling nozzle on the structure of an atmospheric, premixed hydrogen/oxygen flame. Second, the probing from a low-pressure flat flame of methane and oxygen, where additionally the impact of buoyancy at large heights above the burner was quantified. Third, iron pentacarbonyl doped, particle forming, low-pressure flames of hydrogen/oxygen and methane/oxygen, with and without <b>probing</b> <b>nozzle.</b> Fourth, an atmospheric, sooting, ethylene/oxygen stagnation flow flame with a probing orifice in the stagnation plane. And finally a silica producing low-pressure flame of hydrogen/oxygen doped with hexamethyldisiloxane, used for laser induced fluorescence measurements of SiO. All these investigations required two- and three-dimensional models of the burner and housing geometry in order to capture all deviations from the one-dimensional assumptions. The results presented in this thesis demonstrated the need for such detailed investigations and also contributed to the improvement of experiments and of the kinetic models derived from the measurements. It could be shown that the one-dimensional assumptions are valid only for a very limited set of conditions and that empirical correction formulas are not of general validity. However, the deviations from the idealizing assumptions can be quantified by complementary fluid mechanical simulations of the individual experiment. Based on these finding, the multi-dimensional flow simulation became a permanent element of the experimental workflow at the Institute for Combustion and Gas Dynamics...|$|R

The polarisation profiles (over 1000 points) allowed direct evaluation of the velocity gradient within the flowing liquid from this molecular-level <b>probe.</b> Inside the <b>nozzle</b> two lateral boundary layers were observed. The velocity profile was flattened, which was attributed to strong chemical interactions with {{the walls of the}} cell.

40|$|Thermocouple {{temperature}} measurements with the Al 2 O 3 covered probe during vacuum plasma spray process were performed. The voltage of arc discharge during plasma spray was constant (31 V) and the arc discharge current varied from 420 A to 800 A. Temperature measurements were done for different distances between the <b>probe</b> and the <b>nozzle</b> of plasma gun (0. 17 – 0. 23 m). The gray body radiation model {{was used to}} describe the experimental results of temperature – time dependencies. The proposed model describes the kinetics of the sample heating in the plasma and the sample cooling after plasma spray had been turned off. The absorbtion factor of a probe surface was evaluated analyzing kinetics of the sample cooling...|$|R
40|$|Helium was {{expended}} {{through a}} supersonic nozzle in a wind tunnel after being partially ionized by an electric arc. Calculations {{based on the}} stagnation proportion of the gas end the area ratio of the nozzle indicated that the static pressure in the wind tunnel was too high to allow isentropic expansion of the gas. A previous investigation noted an extreme reduction of thrust output at this area ratio, {{as compared to the}} thrust obtained at smaller area ratios, indicating the possibility of a chock in the <b>nozzle.</b> <b>Probes</b> wore developed to measure the degree of ionization and pressure downstream of a normal shock. From these two properties, the free stream properties of the gas were calculated. The Mach number was far below that predicted for isentropic expansion, indicating that a shock did occur in the nozzle...|$|R

The ventilation system of WESF (Waste Encapsulation and Storage Facility) {{is designed to provide}} airflow patterns so that air movement throughout the building is from areas of lesser radioactivity to areas of greater radioactivity. All potentially contaminated areas are maintained at a negative pressure with respect to the atmosphere so that air flows into the building at all times. The exhaust discharging through the 296 -B- 10 stack is continuously monitored and sampled using a sampling and monitoring probe assembly located approximately 17. 4 meters (57 feet) above the base of the stack. The probe assembly consists of 5 nozzles for the sampling <b>probe</b> and 2 <b>nozzles</b> to monitor the flow.

40|$|The Gravity Probe B {{experiment}} to test Einstein's relativity theory {{is a possible}} Space Shuttle project. Cooling of the gyroscopes and thrusting of the Probe into a zero-drag environment is accomplished by vaporizing liquid helium and venting the gas from the <b>Probe</b> through a <b>nozzle</b> system. In order to avoid malfunctioning of this cooling-thruster system, the pressure difference across the vent pipe-thruster system must be maintained {{to be less than}} the vapor pressure of liquid helium at the given temperature. This study investigated helium gas flow through the vent pipe for various configurations, mass flow rates, and pipe diameters. In addition, pertinent properties of both liquid and gaseous helium were investigated. It was observed that helical coiling of the pipe about the Dewar caused less frictional drag and less pressure change than did sharp pipe bending. Also, for various flow rates and nozzle throat area sizes, the system would malfunction for a given bath temperature...|$|R
