40|$|Abstract. Software {{engineering}} disciplines need to {{be taught}} in contexts as di-verse as undergraduate courses and large corporations training programs. A primary challenge in teaching such disciplines, in any context, is to quickly and effectively evaluate the students learning and measure their strengths and weak-nesses. Another challenge is to make students of different instances of a disci-pline end up with the same basic foundations, making the competences indepen-dent of the instructor. To overcome these challenges we propose an approach for software engineering teaching based on adapted <b>PDCA</b> <b>cycles</b> and check-lists as instruments of evaluation. We also report a case study which shows the implementation of this approach in teaching a first year undergraduate soft-ware engineering course. With a careful definition of checklists, the use of the adapted version of PDCA as a methodology for software engineering teaching is promising, allowing an efficient form of evaluation. 1...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Hanshin Expressway is {{an urban}} {{expressway}} network in Osaka-Kobe area accommodating more than 900, 000 vehicles per day. Since {{it is one}} of the most important transportation infrastructures in the area, the highest level of Rehabilitation and Maintenance (R&M) quality is always required and we have met the need by developing many efficient maintenance methods. However, due to the lacks of the sufficient budget for highway R&M, the highway administration bodies are requested to reduce the expenditures for R&M activities. Hanshin Expressway has accelerated to develop a new approach for efficient Road R&M after its privatization. In this paper, the logic model for R&M (named HELM; Hanshin Expressway Logic Model), which was developed by the Hanshin Expressway Corporation, is presented to administrate the whole system of R&M activities in an efficient way. This paper presents the risk management diagrams for the highway patrol, by which the administrative bodies can efficiently design the optimal patrol frequency given the predetermined risk levels based on HELM. The paper is concluded by summarizing the ongoing research agenda to improve the HELM throughout the <b>PDCA</b> <b>cycles</b> of the real R&M activities...|$|R

40|$|Libraries, {{archives}} and museums {{around the globe}} are exposed to risks stemming from environmental conditions and human-driven potential hazards. Since an emergency/disaster immediately breaks out, the four key principles of disaster management, namely preparedness, damage reduction, intervention and improvement, should strictly be defined proactively, planned and necessary measures should be taken beforehand. In a well set-up Library, Archive (information and documentation centers) and Museum Risk Management, {{it is important to}} define the hazards and prioritize them after the assessment of the risks that may be posed by such hazards. Again based on this management system, continuous improvement through Plan-Do-Check-Act (<b>PDCA)</b> <b>cycles</b> should be aimed. Risk analyses should be performed in consideration of the incidence frequency, severity and duration of emergency/ disasters; number of collection, library and archive items; number of workers; number of users; building characteristics (structural quality, quality of non-structural elements, geological condition of soil, etc.) as well as the properties of hazardous facilities surrounding the building. Separate strategies to control each risk originating from hazards (aimed at controlling the risks in the short, medium and long term) should be defined. In this study, the importance of risk analysis and risk assessment for Libraries, Archives and Museums under the Occupational Health and Safety Law no 6331 has been emphasized, and a sample risk analysis based on the 5 x 5 risk matrix method is presented. ...|$|R

This work presents relationship analysis results concerning sourcing, demand planning, and logistics processes and relationships based upon a case study conducted at a multinational corporation. These results identified key relationship strengths and weaknesses across three value chains. These results, combined with results from the academic literature, are used to develop an organized list of relationship factors useful for relationship assessment and modeling purposes. The relationship factors are {{used to create a}} new Supply Chain Relationship Assessment Model (SCRAM) that incorporates the use of Plan-Do-Check-Act (<b>PDCA)</b> <b>cycles</b> and the use of statistical process control (SPC) to assess, monitor, and manage individual relationship performance. These methods can be incorporated into existing customer, supplier, or SCM software systems. This thesis extends and builds upon the existing academic literature in the fields of marketing, purchasing, and supply chain management, most importantly in developing an approach to quantify the impact of supply chain relationship factors and strategic changes upon overall supply chain performance. More accurate and precise quantification of relationship factors and relationship performance could lead to better selection of SC partners, improve SC relationships, lower SC costs, and increase value for customers...|$|R

40|$|Home care organisations for {{the elderly}} {{frequently}} publish detailed performance information related {{to the quality of}} care provided as a means to assist potential clients in their choice of health care provider. A further benefit of this transparency can be found in its use by both care insurers and purchasers alike. The “Quality framework for responsible care” was developed to emphasize and quantify performance by health care providers, unfortunately parties have been unable to agree on a commonality of performance indicators to use as a basis for the chosen system. How does this then effect the health care providers? Does the chosen system help to determine their objectives and can it provide sufficient insight to determine if these objectives are achieved? The study of scientific literature related to the use of performance indicators as a means to organizational improvement is inconclusive and does not provide sufficient answers. The goal of this research was to contribute to the further development of theories about objectives and the use of performance information in the public sector in the Netherlands. To this end the research focuses on the application of the theory by managers in AWBZ health care organisations in the Netherlands. The following problem statement was formed; Which management objectives can be achieved in home care organisations through the use of performance information and to what extent have these objectives been reached? To answer our problem statement five research questions were posed; 1. What objectives for using performance information by managers within the public sector were highlighted in the literature research? Much has been written in the last twenty years regarding achieving improvement in the public services. Only through dialogue and further discussion are we able to bring focus to methods and aids useful in improving performance information systems. Seeking answers as to why we make certain decisions and choices provides us with the necessary background information that is critical to the understanding of achieving management enhancement through performance information. 2. What does scientific literature tell about goal achievement? Result evaluation makes it possible to quantify and measure success in achieving our goals and to this end a clear starting point from which all results can be quantified is critical. This process is of course retroactive and results are only visible after distillation of all available data. Process evaluation is a second possibility to measure goal achievement. 3. What objectives are distinguished by managers working in home care organisations? The eight goals set by Behn (2003) have been empirically observed and managers formulate objectives to achieve set performance improvements. Objectives are of course set and anchored within organisational policy and must be periodically evaluated. These results are used to further fine tune the organisational competencies, skill and behaviour of employees leading to organisational improvement. This leads to better motivated employees and a consequent celebration of positive organisational achievement. Through this positive attitude is the organisation well positioned with respect to stakeholders such as; clients, care agencies, employees, funders, purchasers and insurers. 4. Which performance indicators are distinguished by managers within home care organisations? The interviews revealed the various performance-indicators in the different objectives in accordance to Behn (2003) and Ter bogt & van Helden (2009). Information related to customer and employee satisfaction are critical indicators for engaging improved performance which, combined with market development indicators, allow organisational adjustments to be made. 5. To what extent can performance information help in the achievement of organisational objectives? Result evaluation was visible in one of the test organisations. Critically the organisation in question had quantified the required performance indicators so that these were measureable. Thus we can assume, by quantifying the performance indicators, that results are better and leads to a perceived achievement of our organisational goals. In all three test organisations <b>PDCA</b> <b>cycles</b> have been mentioned. <b>PDCA</b> <b>cycles</b> result in process evaluations which leads us into a review of objectives and where necessary a realignment of organisational policy. By observing the nine managers goals and objectives within their organisations, it was possible to see if the Behn theory (2003) occurred, thus validating the theory in a practical, hands on setting. Our empirical research resulted in two additions to the Behn theory (2003); 1. 	Determining desired behaviour from organisational values and expressing goals to improve organisational behaviour. This was also verified by the three cases evaluated in our research. 2. 	Stimulating the development of commercial activity to increase or maintain market position was also observed. This did not lead to a measureable improvement within the time frame of our research. In conclusion we believe {{that it is necessary to}} quantify goals if these are to lead to increased transparency...|$|R
