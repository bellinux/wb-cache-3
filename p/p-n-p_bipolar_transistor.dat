In a previous paper [Breglio G, Irace A, Napoli E, Spirito P, Hamada K, Nishijima T, et al. Study of a failure mechanism during UIS switching of planar PT-IGBT with current sense cell. Microelectron Reliab 2007; 47 (9 – 11) : 1756 – 60] we have demonstrated how, during UIS switching in particular circuit configurations, the interplay between the sense-emitter cell and the rest of the device can lead to latch-up of the lateral <b>p–n–p</b> <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistor</b> and current focalization in the sense-emitter cell which finally causes device failure. In this paper, we show how the location of this very localized failure spot can be very accurately determined with the aid of a very sensitive lock-in thermography setup.

A physical-vapor-deposited (PVD) amorphous silicon layer is converted to monocrystalline silicon selectively in the contact windows by using a PVD aluminum layer as a transport medium. This is a solid-phase-epitaxy (SPE) {{process by which the}} grown Si is Al-doped to at least 1018 cm− 3. Contact resistivity below 10 − 7 Ω · cm 2 is achieved to both p − and p+ bulk-silicon regions.

In this work, the first experimental observation of quasi-heterojunction <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors</b> utilizing a monolayer of the lateral WSe 2 -MoS 2 junctions as the conducting p-n channel is demonstrated.

40|$|New {{electrostatic}} discharge (ESD) clamp devices for using in power-rail ESD clamp circuits with the substrate-triggered technique are {{proposed to improve}} ESD level in a limited silicon area. The parasitic n–p–n and <b>p–n–p</b> <b>bipolar</b> junction <b>transistors</b> (BJTs) in the CMOS devices are used to form the substrate-triggered devices for ESD protection. Four substrate-triggered devices are proposed and investigated in this work, which are named as the substrate-triggered lateral BJT, the substrate-triggered vertical BJT, the substrate-triggered double BJT, and the double-triggered double BJT. An RC-based ESD-detection circuit is used to generate the triggering current {{to turn on the}} proposed substrate-triggered devices. In order to trigger on the parasitic <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistors</b> more effectively, the symmetric multiple-cell square-type layout method is used to realize these substrate-triggered devices. The power-rail ESD clamp circuits with such substrate-triggered devices have been fabricated in a 0. 6 -lm CMOS process. Experimental results have shown that the substrate-triggered device with double-BJT structure can provide 200 % higher ESD robustness in per silicon area, as compared to the NMOS with the traditional gate-driven design. 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Hole-initiated {{avalanche}} multiplication is investigated using an AlGaAs/InGaAs <b>p-n-p</b> heterojunction <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistor</b> (HBT). Both experimental measurements and theoretical calculation {{are used to}} determine the {{avalanche multiplication}} factor. A large departure is observed at low electric field when comparison is made between the measured data and theoretical results obtained from the standard ionization model. The comparison shows that the conventional impact ionization model, based on local electric field, substantially overestimates the hole avalanche multiplication factor Mp - 1 in the AlGaAs/InGaAs p-n-p HBT, where a significant dead space effect occurs in the collector space-charge region. A simple correction model for the dead space is proposed, that allows the multiplication to be accurately predicted, even in a heavily doped structure. Based on this model, multiplication characteristics for different threshold energy of the hole are calculated. A threshold energy of 2. 5 eV was determined to be suitable for describing the hole-initiated impact ionization process. © 2001 American Institute of Physics. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) {{stackable}} {{memory devices}} including nano-scaled crossbar array are central for {{the realization of}} high-density non-volatile memory electronics. However, an essential sneak path issue affecting device performance in crossbar array remains a bottleneck and a grand challenge. Therefore, a suitable bidirectional selector as a two-way switch is required to facilitate a major breakthrough in the 3 D crossbar array memory devices. Here, we show the excellent selectivity of all oxide p-/n-type semiconductor-based <b>p-n-p</b> open-based <b>bipolar</b> junction <b>transistors</b> as selectors in crossbar memory array. We report that bidirectional nonlinear characteristics of oxide p-n-p junctions can be highly enhanced by manipulating p-/n-type oxide semiconductor characteristics.

Our experimental findings are further extended to confirm the profound functionality of oxide p-n-p selectors integrated with several bipolar resistive switching memory elements working as storage nodes.
