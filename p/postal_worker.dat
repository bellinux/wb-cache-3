5|$|Jingle All the Way is a 1996 American comedy film {{directed}} by Brian Levant and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sinbad, with Phil Hartman, Rita Wilson, Jake Lloyd, James Belushi and Robert Conrad. The plot focuses on two rival fathers, workaholic Howard Langston (Schwarzenegger) and stressed out <b>postal</b> <b>worker</b> Myron Larabee (Sinbad), both {{desperately trying to}} get a Turbo-Man action figure for their respective sons on a last minute shopping spree on Christmas Eve.|$|E
5|$|While Sanger was in Europe, {{her husband}} {{continued}} her work, {{which led to}} his arrest after he distributed {{a copy of a}} birth control pamphlet to an undercover <b>postal</b> <b>worker.</b> The arrest and his 30-day jail sentence prompted several mainstream publications, including Harper's Weekly and the New-York Tribune, to publish articles about the birth control controversy. Emma Goldman and Ben Reitman toured the country, speaking in support of the Sangers, and distributing copies of Sanger's pamphlet Family Limitation. Sanger's exile and her husband's arrest propelled the birth control movement into the forefront of American news.|$|E
5|$|Silcott was 26 {{years old}} when he was arrested, the oldest of the six charged with murder. He was born in Tottenham in 1959; his parents, both Seventh-day Adventists, had arrived in England from Montserrat two years earlier. He told Rose that he had {{experienced}} racism throughout his entire upbringing, particularly from the police. After leaving school at 15, he took a series of low-paying jobs and in 1976 began breaking into houses. The following year he was convicted of nine counts of burglary and sent to borstal for a few months, and in 1979 he was sentenced to six months for wounding. In September 1980 he stood trial for the murder of 19-year-old Lennie McIntosh, a <b>postal</b> <b>worker,</b> who was stabbed and killed at a party in Muswell Hill in 1979. The first trial resulted in a hung jury; a second trial saw him acquitted.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, Gretzky {{sold the}} card to Wal-Mart and Treat Entertainment for $500,000. The two {{companies}} {{intended to use}} the card as the grand prize in a promotional contest. The card was sent all across the United States, as part of Wal-Mart's plan to rejuvenate the baseball card market. On February 24 of the following year, the 122nd anniversary of Wagner's birthday, the grand prize drawing for the card was held on CNN's Larry King Weekend. At around 9:00 P.M., Hall of Fame third baseman Brooks Robinson, one of King's guests on the show, pulled out {{the name of one}} Patricia Gibbs, a <b>postal</b> <b>worker</b> living in Hollywood, Florida. After spending hours unsuccessfully trying to contact Gibbs, King's staff finally got through to her phone, and informed Gibbs of her prize. Treat Entertainment and Wal-Mart gave the card to Gibbs a few weeks later at a Wal-Mart store in Miramar, Florida. Gibbs could not afford the taxes on the card, so she decided to consign the card to an auction later on. She consigned the card to Christie's, a New York-based auction house better known for selling famous artworks.|$|E

25|$|Initially, {{mindful of}} the need to {{preserve}} their reputation for safety, the railway company allowed only the overall timings for the run to be put into print; neither The Times report of the following day nor Rous-Marten's article in The Railway Magazine of June 1904 mentioned the maximum speed. However, the morning after the run two local Plymouth newspapers did report that the train had reached a speed between 99 and 100 miles an hour whilst descending Wellington Bank, Somerset. This claim was based on the stopwatch timings of a <b>postal</b> <b>worker,</b> William Kennedy, who was also on the train.|$|E
40|$|Dog bites are {{the third}} {{most common cause of}} {{absenteeism}} among <b>postal</b> <b>workers</b> of the Brazilian National Postal Service in Southern Brazil, with an average off-work time of approximately two days for each biting episode. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the neighborhood characteristics involving dog bites that occurred during work time in <b>postal</b> <b>workers,</b> its impact on work and consequent preventive alternatives. A descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study was designed for all Curitiba <b>postal</b> <b>workers.</b> Data were descriptively analyzed and the hypothesis of correlation between median monthly income, population density and occurrence of dog bites was tested. A total of 34. 9 % of the <b>postal</b> <b>workers</b> answered the questionnaire and 64. 6 % of them had been bitten while working. The odds of bites occurring in a neighborhood increase by 1. 035 times for every increase in one unit in the population density and decrease by 0. 998 times for every increase of US$ 1. 00 in the neighborhood median monthly income of the head of the family. The occurrence of dog bites among <b>postal</b> <b>workers</b> in Curitiba is related to income and population density and prevention strategies should address mailbox position and adequate fencing to provide protection for <b>postal</b> <b>workers...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} between 2004 and 2011 at mail sorting facilities in Sweden. During this time, different interventions were performed. The {{first was a}} lighting intervention that had {{a positive impact on}} the <b>postal</b> <b>workers,</b> especially those with eyestrain. A new lighting system also improved the illuminance and gave better light distribution. The second intervention involved new personal spectacles for the <b>postal</b> <b>workers</b> who needed them and this had a positive effect on eyestrain. The third intervention involved a specific type of sorting spectacles for the <b>postal</b> <b>workers</b> who already used progressive lenses privately. The reading distances that the <b>postal</b> <b>workers</b> had while sorting the mail was inverted to the distances in their regular progressive lenses. The new sorting spectacles had a positive effect on head postures and on muscular activity...|$|R

25|$|The IRA ceasefire from 31 August 1994 gave an {{opportunity}} to the British to collect intelligence to be used against the snipers. The truce was strongly resented by South Armagh IRA members. During the ceasefire, an alleged member of the Drumintee squad, Kevin Donegan, was arrested by an RUC patrol {{in relation to the}} 1994 murder of a <b>postal</b> <b>worker</b> in the course of an armed robbery. When the IRA ended the ceasefire with the bombing of the London Docklands in February 1996, some volunteers had already abandoned the organisation, while others had turned to criminal activities. The period after the ceasefire saw little IRA activity in South Armagh.|$|E
25|$|Two more anthrax letters, {{bearing the}} same Trenton postmark, were dated October 9, {{three weeks after}} the first mailing. The letters were {{addressed}} to two Democratic Senators, Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Patrick Leahy of Vermont. At the time, Daschle was the Senate Majority leader and Leahy was head of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Daschle letter was opened by an aide, Grant Leslie, on October 15, and the government mail service was shut down. The unopened Leahy letter was discovered in an impounded mailbag on November 16. The Leahy letter had been misdirected to the State Department mail annex in Sterling, Virginia, because a ZIP code was misread; a <b>postal</b> <b>worker</b> there, David Hose, contracted inhalational anthrax.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{construction}} workers and counter-protesters moved across City Hall Park toward city hall. They mounted the steps, planted their flags {{at the top of}} the steps, then attempted to gain entrance. Police on duty at city hall initially barred them, but soon the mob pushed past. A few workers entered the building. A <b>postal</b> <b>worker</b> rushed onto the roof of city hall and raised the U.S. flag there to full mast. When city workers lowered the flag back down to half-mast, a large number of construction workers stormed past the police. Deputy Mayor Richard Aurelio, fearing the building would be overrun by the mob, ordered city workers to raise the flag back to full mast.|$|E

25|$|The letters sent to {{the media}} {{contained}} a coarse brown material, while the letters {{sent to the}} two U.S. Senators contained a fine powder. The brown granular anthrax mostly caused skin infections, cutaneous anthrax (9 out of 12 cases), although Kathy Nguyen's case of inhalation anthrax occurred {{at the same time}} and in the same general area as two cutaneous cases and several other exposures. The AMI letter which caused inhalation cases in Florida appears to have been mailed at the same time as the other media letters. The fine powder anthrax sent to the senators mostly caused the more dangerous form of infection known as inhalational anthrax (8 out of 10 cases). <b>Postal</b> <b>worker</b> Patrick O'Donnell and accountant Linda Burch contracted cutaneous anthrax from the Senate letters.|$|E
25|$|In April 1944, with 120 other agents, he {{was charged}} with {{gathering}} intelligence about enemy military installations, supply depots and troop movements in northern France, in preparation for the upcoming Allied invasion. Deployed by parachute near Chartres, disguised as a <b>postal</b> <b>worker,</b> Veuve acquired and transmitted information about crucial enemy infrastructure, such as Le Bourget airport, an oil refinery and an underground rocket factory. To avoid radiolocation of his signal, he emplaced himself close to a German military unit's transmitter. After the Allied invasion, Veuve shifted his operations further inland, on one occasion narrowly escaping an SS raid with a bullet wound in his foot, while his two bodyguards were captured and executed. With the advancing Allied forces he eventually reached Germany, being one of the first Allied officers to reach the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.|$|E
25|$|Dunham married Jordis McCoo, a black <b>postal</b> <b>worker,</b> in 1931, {{but he did}} {{not share}} her {{interests}} and they gradually drifted apart, finally divorcing in 1938. About that time Dunham met and began to work with John Thomas Pratt, a Canadian who had become one of America's most renowned costume and theatrical set designers. Pratt, who was white, shared Dunham's interests in African-Caribbean cultures and was happy to put his talents in her service. After he became her artistic collaborator, they became romantically involved. In the summer of 1941, after the national tour of Cabin in the Sky ended, they went to Mexico, where inter-racial marriages were less controversial than in the United States, and engaged in a commitment ceremony on 20 July, which thereafter they gave as the date of their wedding. In fact, that ceremony was not recognized as a legal marriage in the United States, a point of law that would come to trouble them some years later. Katherine Dunham and John Pratt married in 1949 to adopt Marie-Christine, a French 14-month-old baby. From the beginning of their association, around 1938, Pratt designed the sets and every costume Dunham ever wore. He continued as her artistic collaborator until his death in 1986.|$|E
