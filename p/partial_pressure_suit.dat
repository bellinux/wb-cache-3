50|$|In 1963 the RAF Aviation Medical Training Centre (AMTC) {{moved from}} its {{original}} location at RAF Upwood to RAF North Luffenham. The Centre was commanded by a senior RAF Medical Officer who with his medical and technical team were responsible for fitting and instructing aircrew {{in the use of}} flying protective clothing and equipment, including <b>partial</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>suits,</b> which kept the pilot conscious in the event of loss of cabin pressure at high altitude. Instruction in medical aspects of high performance aviation included experience of hypoxia and exposure to sudden explosive decompression of an aircraft cabin. This was carried out in a complex of RAF Mark V decompression chambers installed on the site for aircrew training and research purposes. Many of the aircrew medical monitoring techniques, oxygen systems and items of aircrew protective flying clothing developed at the RAF Institute of Aviation Medicine, Farnborough, were assessed by staff of AMTC.|$|R
50|$|The VKK flight suit (Russian: высотный компенсирующий костюм), is {{a series}} of Russian high-altitude <b>partial</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>suit,</b> which loosely {{translates}} 'altitude compensation suit'. It has been the standard issue for pilots of both the Soviet Air Forces and the Russian Aerospace Forces for jet aircraft since 1958.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{development}} of jet fighter aircraft after World War II, higher altitudes were much more achievable, presenting a risk of low air pressure exposure to pilots. To counter this, the Soviet Air Forces employed use of the VKK-1 <b>partial</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>suit,</b> which began to see use in 1958 {{as part of the}} 1958 KKO-1 oxygen equipment system.http://www.red-alliance.net/forum/index.php?topic=26339.40;wap2 ...|$|E
5000|$|The Launch Entry Suit (LES), {{known as}} the [...] "pumpkin suit", was a <b>partial</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>suit</b> worn by all Space Shuttle crews for the ascent and entry {{portions}} of flight from STS-26 (1988) to STS-65 (1994). It was completely phased out by STS-88 (late 1998) and replaced by the ACES suit. The suit was manufactured by the David Clark Company of Worcester, Massachusetts.|$|E
50|$|The LES {{was first}} worn by U.S. Air Force pilots in the mid-1970s, {{replacing}} a similar suit worn by SR-71 and U-2 pilots, and was {{identical to the}} suits worn by X-15 pilots and Gemini astronauts. Unlike the ACES suit, which is a full-pressure suit, the high-altitude <b>suits</b> were <b>partial</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>suits,</b> thus requiring a rubber diaphragm around the wearer's face. With {{the development of the}} Space Shuttle, and the inclusion of ejection seats on the Space Shuttle Columbia on the first four flights (STS-1 to STS-4), NASA decided to adopt modified versions of the suit; the modifications being the attachments to the parachute harness, and the adoption of inflatable bladders in the legs to prevent the crew from passing out during reentry. One other modification, a mount for prescription glasses, was incorporated for astronaut John W. Young, who wore modified bifocal reading glasses (resembling aviator sunglasses, but with the top portion, usually for distance seeing, being of regular glass, and the bottom, for reading, of the wearer's prescription) during the flight.|$|R
50|$|A <b>pressure</b> <b>suit</b> is {{normally}} required at around 15,000 m for a well conditioned and experienced pilot to safely {{operate an aircraft}} in unpressurized cabins. In an unpressurized cockpit, at altitudes greater than 11,900 m above sea level, the physiological reaction, even when breathing pure oxygen is hypoxia—inadequate oxygen level causing confusion and eventual loss of consciousness. Air contains 20.95% oxygen. At 11,900 m, breathing pure oxygen through an unsealed face mask, one is breathing the same <b>partial</b> <b>pressure</b> of oxygen as one would experience with regular air at around 3600 m above sea level. At higher altitudes, oxygen must be delivered through a sealed mask with increased pressure, to maintain a physiologically adequate <b>partial</b> <b>pressure</b> of oxygen. If the user does not wear a <b>pressure</b> <b>suit</b> or a counter-pressure garment that restricts the movement of their chest, the high pressure air can cause damage to the lungs.|$|R
50|$|David Clark {{worked closely}} with the {{laboratory}} of Earl Wood at the Mayo Clinic when developing the early G-suit. The goal was to prevent blackout during high-G forces experienced during dive bombing maneuvers. With the physiologic principles of blackout during high G-forces worked out by Wood and colleagues, the g-activated single <b>pressure</b> <b>suit</b> utilizing air bladders, first released in 1943 with improvements to follow in 1944, provided, what was considered to be a significant advantage for the allied forces. Of key importance was Wood and colleague's recognition that gravitationally induced loss of consciousness (GLOC) was due to relative loss of arterial pressure pushing blood to the head rather than a loss of venous return. Since 1946, DCC's continuous <b>pressure</b> <b>suit</b> research and development efforts, sponsored largely by the Department of Defense to support its USAF high-altitude aircraft (Lockheed U-2 and SR-71) programs, resulted in the late 1980s development of a new generation <b>pressure</b> <b>suit.</b> The result was the S1034 Pilot's Protective Assembly (PPA). The S1034 PPA has since become the USAF and DoD standard <b>pressure</b> <b>suit</b> and served as the basis for NASA's S1035 Advanced Crew Escape Suit (ACES). This was adopted for the Space Shuttle program, replacing DCC's (<b>partial</b> <b>pressure)</b> S1032 Launch Entry Suit (LES). Both the S1034 PPA and S1035 ACES continue to be used by the USAF and NASA.|$|R

5000|$|To {{test the}} {{parachute}} system, staff at Wright Field built a 200 ft high helium balloon with {{a capacity of}} nearly [...] that could lift an open gondola and test pilot into the stratosphere. Captain Joseph Kittinger, who was test director for the project, made three ascents and test jumps. As the gondola was unpressurized, Kittinger wore a modified David Clark MC-3A <b>partial</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>suit</b> during these tests, plus additional layers of clothing {{to protect him from}} the extreme cold at high altitude. Together with the parachute system, this almost doubled his weight.|$|E
5000|$|... 14 October 1947 [...] The T-1 partial {{pressure}} suit’s development marked a milestone when Captain Chuck Yeager wore the skin-tight garment made from nylon and cotton during {{the flight of}} the first rocket-powered airplane, the X-1, at Edwards AFB, California. While Capt. Yeager broke the sound barrier in the X-1 that day, more importantly the T-1 <b>partial</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>suit</b> contributed to his survival. Aerospace medicine pioneer Dr. Harry Armstrong, who became the Air Force’s second Surgeon General, initiated {{the development of the}} T-1 in 1943 in collaboration with contractor Dr. James P. Henry, a University of Southern California physiologist. The suit was completed at the end of World War II at the Aero Medical Laboratory that Dr. Armstrong had founded at Wright Field, Ohio. The T-1 served as the model for subsequent Air Force {{partial pressure}} suits needed by aircrews in advanced high performance aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|Hyperventilation, the body’s {{most common}} {{response}} to hypoxia, does help to partially restore the <b>partial</b> <b>pressure</b> of {{oxygen in the}} blood, but it also causes carbon dioxide (CO2) to out-gas, raising the blood pH and inducing alkalosis. Passengers may experience fatigue, nausea, headaches, sleeplessness, and (on extended flights) even pulmonary oedema. These are the same symptoms that mountain climbers experience, but the limited duration of powered flight makes the development of pulmonary oedema unlikely. Altitude sickness may be controlled by a full <b>pressure</b> <b>suit</b> with helmet and faceplate, which completely envelops the body in a pressurized environment; however, this is impractical for commercial passengers.|$|R
40|$|Although {{the full}} <b>pressure</b> <b>suits</b> {{currently}} in the USAF operational inventory provide acceptable performance and crew protection for these missions, there is considerable room for improvement, especially {{in the areas of}} comfort, mobility, glove and helmet performance, and maintenance/supportability. As future aircraft push the envelope towards operations at higher and higher altitudes and transatmospheric flight, advances in full <b>pressure</b> <b>suit</b> technology will be needed. Also, enhanced <b>pressure</b> <b>suit</b> technology will be required to meet NASA's need for protection during future EVA operations for both on-orbit and planetary surface missions. This presentation will review the results of efforts at the Armstrong Laboratory to develop and demonstrate advanced full <b>pressure</b> <b>suit</b> technology for use in future high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft and transatmospheric vehicle operations. For those readers who may not be familiar with this area of life support equipment, a brief review of the important physiological and operational requirements for full <b>pressure</b> <b>suits</b> used in these applications will be addressed first, followed by a summary of the current state-of-the-art in USAF <b>pressure</b> <b>suit</b> technology.

50|$|Following the war, the Cold War caused {{continued}} {{funding of}} aviation development, which included high altitude, high speed research such as NACA's X-1. James Henry of the University of Southern California devised a <b>partial</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>suit</b> using an oxygen mask to provide pressurised oxygen, with gas pressure also inflating rubber tubes called capstans {{to tighten the}} suit and provide sufficient mechanical counterpressure to just balance the breathing pressure necessary to prevent hypoxia at a particular altitude. The David Clark Company supplied technical support and resources, and a prototype suit was tested to a simulated 90,000 feet at Wright Field in 1946. Henry's design was subsequently developed by the David Clark Company into the S-1 and T-1 flight suit used by X-1 pilots. The X-1 was succeeded by the Douglas Skyrocket, whose objective was to exceed Mach 2, and an improved pressure suit was required. David Clark won the contract in 1951 with their first full pressure suit, the Model 4 Full Pressure Suit; it was first flown in 1953 by USMC aviator Marion E. Carl who became the first US military aviator to wear a full pressure suit, {{at the same time}} setting an unofficial worlds altitude record in the Skyrocket.|$|E
40|$|The LES is a <b>partial</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>suit</b> and a {{component}} of the shuttle life support system used during launch and reentry. The LES relies on gas ventilation with cabin air to provide cooling. There are conditions during nominal launch and reentry, landing, and post-landing phases when cabin temperature is elevated. Under these conditions, gas cooling may result in some discomfort and some decrement in orthostatic tolerance. There are emergency conditions involving loss of cabin ECS capability that would challenge crew thermal tolerance. The results of a series of tests are presented. These tests were conducted to assess the effectiveness of a liquid-cooled garment in alleviating thermal discomfort, orthostatic intolerance, and thermal intolerance during simulated mission phases...|$|E

The oronasal mask was favored by the pilots due to its immobility on the face during high g-loading. The garment was chosen to provide optimum dexterity for the pilot, which is not available in a full pressure suit, while protecting the pilot at altitudes up to 18, 288 meters, during a cabin decompression, and subsequent aircraft descent. During cabin decompressions in the F- 104 and F- 15, cabin pressure altitude was measured at various aircraft angles of attack, Mach numbers, and altitudes {{to determine the effect}} of the aerodynamic slipstream on the cabin altitude...|$|E

500|$|As a {{consequence}} of rapid decompression, any oxygen dissolved in the blood will empty into the lungs to try to equalize the <b>partial</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient.

Blood and other body fluids boil when the pressure drops below 6.3kPa, and this condition is called ebullism. The steam may bloat the body to twice its normal size and slow circulation, but tissues are elastic and porous enough to prevent rupture. Ebullism is slowed by the pressure containment of blood vessels, so some blood remains liquid.
