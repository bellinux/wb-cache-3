40|$|The overall {{objective}} of the photovoltaic program {{is to ensure that}} photovoltaic conversion systems {{play a significant role in}} the nation's energy supply by stimulating an industry capable of providing approximately 50 GWe of installed electricity generating capacity by the year 2000. In order to achieve this {{overall objective}}, several time-phased program goals have been defined. Near-term goals are to achieve photovoltaic flat-plate module or concentrator array prices of $ 2 per <b>peak</b> <b>watt</b> (1975 dollars) at an annual production rate of 20 peak megawatts in 1982. At this price level, energy costs should range from 100 to 200 mills/kwh.

Studies project that photovoltaic systems will begin to compete for both distributed and larger load-center utility-type applications and thereby open up significant markets for large-scale photovoltaic systems. Far term goals are to achieve the photovoltaic flat-plate module or concentrator array price goal of $ 0. 10 to $ 0. 30 per <b>peak</b> <b>watt</b> in 1990 (in 1975 dollars), and an annual production rate of 10 to 20 peak gigawatts in 2000.

Methods: 35 patients with CHF (NYHA II-III, age 54 +/- 9 y, LVEF 31 +/- 10 %) performed 3 maximal exercise tests, i. e. at the start, middle and end of a 6 month ET program.

40|$|Background: The {{management}} {{of patients with}} severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) is a clinical challenge because the indication for valve replacement is dependent on symptoms, and therefore the decision for a valve operation is reliant on subjective factors. An approach to improve the efficacy of a surgical procedure is to evaluate {{the status of the}} ventricle in addition to analyzing the severity of the valvular disease. We propose to further investigate the independent predictive value of variables measured during stress echocardiography, as well as the cardiopulmonary exercise capacity. Methods and results: For this purpose we put 48 patients with asymptomatic AS under a double stress protocol, including dobutamine stress echocardiography and cardiopulmonary exercise testing and followed the patients over a mean of 756 days (range: 100 - 2146 days) to identify a combined endpoint of death or aortic valve replacement. Initially, univariate analysis identified following parameters predicting the combined endpoint: chronic obstructive lung disease, female sex, stroke work loss (SWL), ejection fraction during dobutamine infusion (EFdb), maximum exercise workload (<b>peak</b> <b>watts).</b> Subsequent multivariable analysis showed that SWL, EFdb and <b>peak</b> <b>watts</b> were independent predictors of the combined endpoint. In another study, we attempted to show which variables predicted an improvement in functional status from valve replacement, since symptomatic improvement was theoretically not an expected outcome in patients who were reportedly asymptomatic per-operatively. For this purpose, we compared parameters before and after valve replacement in 20 patients with asymptomatic AS and compared them with 18 symptomatic patients with similar severity of AS. Initially, we determined that asymptomatic patients expectably showed no significant improvement of their subjective exercise tolerance, though there was a trend toward improved VO 2 peak (p= 0. 07). The postoperative values showed a significant improvement over the symptomatic patients.
