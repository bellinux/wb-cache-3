40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the performance of a <b>paper</b> <b>drier</b> operating on solar-heated hot water. A small-scale prototype of a flat tank <b>paper</b> <b>drier</b> was built and tested in a variety of conditions and with a variety of handmade paper types.

This corresponds to a drier efficiency of up to 80 %, with reference to the latent heat of evaporation. Drier temperature variations were minimal, and the performance was considered satisfactory to continue with further development of the drier for local handmade paper production facilities. Measured drying rates compared well with predicted values calculated using correlations based on Stefan's law...|$|R

50|$|The {{process of}} wet-folding allows a folder to {{preserve}} a curved shape more easily. It also reduces the number of wrinkles substantially. Wet-folding allows for increased rigidity and structure due to a process called sizing. Sizing is a water-soluble adhesive, usually methylcellulose or methyl acetate that may be added during the manufacture of the paper. As the <b>paper</b> <b>dries,</b> the chemical bonds the fibers of the paper tighter together which results in a crisper and stronger sheet. In order to moisten the paper, an artist typically wipes the sheet with a dampened cloth. The amount of moisture added to the paper is crucial, because too little will cause the <b>paper</b> to <b>dry</b> quickly and spring back into its original position before the folding is complete, but too much will fray {{the edges of the}} paper or will cause the paper to split at high-stress points.|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{information}} regarding the phenomena of mass, heat, and momentum transfer in coated <b>paper</b> <b>drying,</b> substantial research work still needs to be done. A simulation model for coated <b>paper</b> <b>drying</b> is introduced which integrates heat and mass transfer mechanisms. In the model, the coated paper was assumed to have 3 layers (coated layer, wet and dry layers of the base paper), in which the thickness of each layer is a function of drying time and condition. The thickness of the wet layer of the base paper was considered to be a function of water permeability rate that in turn {{is a function of the}} moisture diffusion coefficient, time and drying rate. Movement of vapor resulting from evaporation in the middle layer was assumed to be a combination of laminar bulk flow and molecular diffusion. Radiation absorption was used as a diminishing exponential model, which depends on moisture content. Hot air and super heated vapor were used as drying fluids. Functional variables were temperature, drying fluid velocity and delay time. To verify the simulation results two compositions were applied for the coating suspension. The simulation results matched well with experimental outcomes...|$|E

40|$|The {{dimensional}} stability of superheated steam <b>dried</b> <b>paper</b> made from groundwood, thermomechanical, chemithermomechanical and bleached kraft pulps were investigated {{in terms of}} hygroexpansivity, drying shrinkage and wet expansion. For all the pulps tested these characteristics of {{dimensional stability}} {{were found to be}} improved by high temperature superheated steam drying. The hygroexpansion coefficient, the dimensional change relative to paper moisture content, was reduced about 15 % by superheated steam drying at 320 °C, compared to <b>paper</b> <b>dried</b> in low temperature air. Irreversible shrinkage was reduced by up to 30 % for sheets dried in superheated steam. However, these effects on hygroexpansivity were caused mainly by the high drying temperature and the resulting high drying rate regardless of the drying fluid. Drying shrinkage and wet expansion as well were reduced by about 10 % and 15 % respectively for <b>paper</b> <b>dried</b> in superheated steam. In superheated steam drying the elevated web temperature at the start of drying is believed to affect paper properties through thermal softening of the lignin and relaxation of drying and wet-pressing stresses. Increased fiber bonding with softened lignin accounts for both the increased elastic modulus and decreased light scattering coefficient observed. These were obtained only for sheets from mechanical pulps with initial moisture content of about 0. 4 kg-water/kg-fiber or more, consistent with the mechanism of thermal softening of plasticized lignin. High sheet temperature in the falling rate period improves hygroscopicity of paper through reducing its equilibrium moisture content. Superheated steam drying improves the dimensional stability of paper from such pulps, including less anisotropy, thereby enhancing paper quality...|$|R
