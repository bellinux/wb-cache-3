40|$|The {{introduction}} of testing for prostate-specific antigen (<b>PSA),</b> a <b>member</b> of the fifteen-gene family of kallikrein-related peptidases and {{also known as}} kallikrein-related peptidase 3 (KLK 3), in blood has revolutionized both the detection and management of prostate cancer. Given the similarities between PSA and other KLK gene family members along with limitations of PSA as a biomarker for prostate cancer mainly in reference to diagnostic specificity, the potential roles of other members of this gene family as well as PSA derivatives and isoforms {{in the management of}} prostate cancer have been studied extensively. Of these, approaches to measure distinct molecular forms of PSA (free, intact, complexed PSA, and pro-PSA) combined with kallikrein-related peptidase 2 (KLK 2), also known as hK 2, have been considered holding particular promise in enhancing the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Recently, an integrated approach of applying a panel of four kallikrein markers has been demonstrated to enhance accuracy in predicting the risk of prostate cancer at biopsy. This review presents an overview of kallikreins, starting with the past and current status of PSA, summarizing published data on the evaluations of various KLKs as biomarkers in the diagnosis, prognostication, and monitoring of prostate cancer...|$|R
40|$|Prostate Specific Antigen (<b>PSA),</b> a <b>member</b> of kallikrein family, is a {{specific}} serine protease of prostatic tissue. In some case reports, changes in PSA levels after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have been reported. In this study we evaluated variations in PSA levels post-AMI. Twenty-six male patients who had PSA levels within reference limits {{were included in the}} study. The diagnosis of AMI was confirmed by clinical findings, ECG (electrocardiogram) and cardiac marker studies. Serum total PSA (tPSA) and free PSA (fPSA) levels were measured at days 0 (day of admission), 1, 2 and 3 after AMI. PSA/ albumin ratio was also calculated in order to evaluate the effect of dilution. A statistical analysis of the results of all patients revealed significant decrease in tPSA levels and tPSA/Albumin ratio at day 2 when compared to days 0 and 3, which showed a similar pattern. Changes of fPSA and fPSA / Albumin ratio according to days were not found significant. In only four patients we found increased levels of tPSA and increased fPSA levels in three of them. These patients displayed severe problems such as renal failure, cardiac failure, ventricular aneurysm and cerebral ischemia due to cardiac arrest. The lower tPSA levels on day 2 suggest that tPSA can be eliminated rapidly from the circulation on days 1 and 2, probably through the formation of complexes of tPSA with acute phase proteins...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Human glandular kallikrein 2 (hK 2) and {{prostate-specific antigen}} (<b>PSA)</b> are <b>members</b> of an {{extensive}} kallikrein family of proteases. Both proteases are secreted as zymogens or proenzymes containing a seven amino acid propeptide {{that must be}} proteolytically removed for enzymatic activation. The physiological proteases that activate pro-hK 2 and pro-PSA are not known. METHODS: The pro-hK 2 peptide sequence is Val-Pro-Leu-Ile-Gln-Ser-Arg (VPLIQSR). For PSA, the amino acid sequence of the propeptide is Ala-Pro-Leu-Ile-Leu-Ser-Arg (APLILSR). Fluorescent substrates were made by coupling these peptide sequences to 7 -amino- 4 -methylcoumarin (AMC). The hydrolysis of the VPLIQSR-AMC and APLILSR-AMC substrates by hK 2, PSA, and a panel of purified proteases was determined. RESULTS: HK 2 readily cleaved the pro-hK 2 peptide substrate VPLIQSR-AMC with a rate of hydrolysis that was approximately 8 -fold higher than an equimolar amount of purified trypsin. HK 2 also had the highest hydrolysis rate from {{among a group of}} other trypsin-like proteases. In contrast, neither hK 2 nor PSA was able to appreciably cleave the pro-PSA substrate APLILSR-AMC. The pro-PSA substrate was most readily hydrolyzed by urokinase and trypsin. CONCLUSIONS: HK 2 can hydrolyze the pro-hK 2 substrate suggesting that maturation of pro-hK 2 to enzymatically active hK 2 involves autoprocessing. As expected, PSA, a chymotrypsin-like protease, was unable to hydrolyze either of the propeptide substrates. Therefore, it is unlikely that PSA can auto-process its own enzymatic function. HK 2 has trypsin-like specificity but was unable to hydrolyze the pro-PSA substrate. These results raise the possibility that an additional processing protease may be required to fully process PSA to an enzymatically active form...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the agreement {{and reliability of}} the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) {{in the assessment of}} nail involvement in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) when performed by rheumatologists with no experience in using this instrument. METHODS: In total, 3 women with PsA, satisfying the Classification of Psoriatic Arthritis Study Group criteria, with nail involvement were selected from an outpatient clinic devoted to PsA. The assessors consisted of 2 groups: 8 expert rheumatologists in the field of <b>PsA</b> who were <b>members</b> of the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis and had extensive experience of > 10 years, and 69 rheumatologists who had never previously used the NAPSI. A video showing the nail of each selected patient (patient A, patient B, and patient C) with the most nail PsA dystrophy was shown to these 2 groups. The 8 assessors of the first group, previously trained in using the NAPSI, evaluated the 3 videos independently by using the NAPSI score. The second group scored the NAPSI after an educational session. This evaluation was repeated after 6 hours with a different sequence of videos (unpaired fashion). Interreader and intrareader reliability were estimated by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and associated 95...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: The serine {{protease}} prostate-specific antigen (PSA) {{is a useful}} clinical marker for prostatic malignancy. <b>PSA</b> is a <b>member</b> of the kallikrein subgroup of the (chymo) trypsin {{serine protease}} family, but differs from the prototypical member of this subgroup, tissue kallikrein, in possessing a specificity more {{similar to that of}} chymotrypsin than trypsin. We report the use of two strategies, substrate phage display and iterative optimization of natural cleavage sites, to identify labile sequences for PSA cleavage. Results: Iterative optimization and substrate phage display converged on the amino-acid sequence SS(Y/F) YIS(G/S) as preferred subsite occupancy for PSA. These sequences were cleaved by PSA with catalytic efficiencies as high as 220 – 3100 M− 1 s− 1, compared with values of 2 – 46 M− 1 s− 1 for peptides containing likely physiological target sequences of PSA from the protein semenogelin. Substrate residues that bind to secondary (non-S 1) subsites have a critical role in defining labile substrates and can even cause otherwise disfavored amino acids to bind in the primary specificity (S 1) pocket. Conclusions: The importance of secondary subsites in defining both the specificity and efficiency of cleavage suggests that substrate recognition by PSA is mediated by an extended binding site. Elucidation of preferred subsite occupancy allowed refinement of the structural model of PSA and should facilitate the development of more sensitive activity-based assays and the design of potent inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|Renal cell {{carcinoma}} (RCC) {{is the most}} common form of kidney cancer, for which there is no biochemical marker. We and others have previously shown that a prostate specific antigen (PSA) -like protein is elevated in the serum of women with RCC. <b>PSA</b> is a <b>member</b> of the tissue kallikrein (KLK) gene family of enzymes. We have constructed a RCC cDNA expression library and screened it for PSA and KLK expression to determine whether they may be responsible for this PSA-like activity. Since immunoscreening of the RCC library for expressed PSA-like proteins was unsuccessful, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the RCC cDNA library was performed using universal KLK primers, directed to the common regions in exon 3 and exon 5 of KLK 1, KLK 2 and KLK 3. Sequences identical to all three KLKs were present in the RCC cDNA library. In addition, a novel KLK 1 transcript with a 104 base pair deletion in exon 4 that predicted a C terminal sequence minus the crucial Ser, was detected. The role of these tissue kallikreins in RCC and the significance of the variant KLK 1 transcript is yet to be established. It is still unclear which of these gene products, if any, was detected in the sera of the women with RCC. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R
