40|$|The 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change commits signatories to {{preventing}} ‘dangerous anthropogenic {{interference with the}} climate system’, leaving unspecified the level of global warming that is dangerous. In the late 1990 s, a limit of 2 °C global warming above <b>preindustrial</b> <b>temperature</b> was proposed as a ‘guard rail’ below {{which most of the}} dangerous climate impacts could be avoided. The 2009 Copenhagen Accord recognized the scientific view ‘that the increase in global temperature should be below 2 degrees Celsius’ despite growing views that this might be too high. At the same time, the continued rise in greenhouse gas emissions in the past decade and the delays in a comprehensive global emissions reduction agreement have made achieving this target extremely difficult, arguably impossible, raising the likelihood of global temperature rises of 3 °C or 4 °C within this century. Yet, there are few studies that assess the potential impacts and consequences of a warming of 4 °C or greater in a systematic manner. Papers in this themed issue provide an initial picture of the challenges facing a world that warms by 4 °C or more, and the difficulties ahead if warming is to be limited to 2 °C with any reasonable certainty. Across many sectors—coastal cities, agriculture, water stress, ecosystems, migration—the impacts and adaptation challenges at 4 °C will be larger than at 2 °C. In some cases, such as farming in sub-Saharan Africa, a + 4 °C warming could result in the collapse of systems or require transformational adaptation out of systems, as we understand them today. The potential severity of impacts and the behavioural, institutional, societal and economic challenges involved in coping with these impacts argue for renewed efforts to reduce emissions, using all available mechanisms, to minimize the chances of high-end climate change. Yet at the same time, {{there is a need for}} accelerated and focused research that improves understanding of how the climate system might behave under a + 4 °C warming, what the impacts of such changes might be and how best to adapt to what would be unprecedented changes in the world we live in...|$|R
40|$|A maximum global-mean warming of 2 ˚C above <b>preindustrial</b> <b>temperatures</b> {{has been}} adopted by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to “prevent {{dangerous}} anthropogenic interference with the climate system”. Attempts to find agreements on emissions reductions have proved highly intractable because industrialized countries are {{responsible for most of}} the historical emissions, while developing countries will produce most of the future emissions. Here we present a Fair Plan for reducing global greenhouse-gas emissions. Under the Plan, all countries begin mitiga-tion in 2015 and reduce greenhouse-gas emissions to zero in 2065. Developing countries are required to follow a miti-gation trajectory that is less aggressive {{in the early years of}} the Plan than the mitigation trajectory for developed coun-tries. The trajectories are chosen such that the cumulative emissions of the Kyoto Protocol’s Annex B (developed) and non-Annex B (developing) countries are equal.

40|$|To limit mean {{global warming}} to 2 [*]°C, a goal {{supported}} {{by more than}} 100 countries, it will likely be necessary to reduce emissions not only of greenhouse gases but also of air pollutants with high radiative forcing (RF), particularly black carbon (BC). Although several recent research papers have attempted to quantify the effects of BC on climate, not all these analyses have incorporated all the mechanisms that contribute to its RF (including the effects of BC on cloud albedo, cloud coverage, and snow and ice albedo, and the optical consequences of aerosol mixing) and have reported their results in different units and with different ranges of uncertainty. Here we attempt to reconcile their results and present them in uniform units that include the same forcing factors. We use the best estimate of effective RF obtained from these results to analyze the benefits of mitigating BC emissions for achieving a specific equilibrium temperature target. For a 500  ppm CO 2 e (3. 1  W m- 2) effective RF target in 2100, which would offer about a 50 % chance of limiting equilibrium warming to 2. 5 [*]°C above <b>preindustrial</b> <b>temperatures,</b> we estimate that failing to reduce carbonaceous aerosol emissions from contained combustion would require CO 2 emission cuts about 8  years (range of 1 – 15  years) earlier than would be necessary with full mitigation of these emissions...|$|E
40|$|Geoengineering (the {{intentional}} {{modification of}} Earth's climate) {{has been proposed}} {{as a means of}} reducing CO 2 -induced climate warming while greenhouse gas emissions continue. Most proposals involve managing incoming solar radiation such that future greenhouse gas forcing is counteracted by reduced solar forcing. In this study, we assess the transient climate response to geoengineering under a business-as-usual CO 2 emissions scenario by using an intermediate-complexity global climate model that includes an interactive carbon cycle. We find that the climate system responds quickly to artificially reduced insolation; hence, there may be little cost to delaying the deployment of geoengineering strategies until such a time as “dangerous” climate change is imminent. Spatial temperature patterns in the geoengineered simulation are comparable with <b>preindustrial</b> <b>temperatures,</b> although this is not true for precipitation. Carbon sinks in the model increase in response to geoengineering. Because geoengineering acts to mask climate warming, there is a direct CO 2 -driven increase in carbon uptake without an offsetting temperature-driven suppression of carbon sinks. However, this strengthening of carbon sinks, combined with the potential for rapid climate adjustment to changes in solar forcing, leads to serious consequences should geoengineering fail or be stopped abruptly. Such a scenario could lead to very rapid climate change, with warming rates up to 20 times greater than present-day rates. This warming rebound would be larger and more sustained should climate sensitivity prove to be higher than expected. Thus, employing geoengineering schemes with continued carbon emissions could lead to severe risks for the global climate system...|$|E
40|$|Solar {{geoengineering}} {{has been}} proposed as a backup plan to offset some aspects of anthropogenic climate change if timely CO 2 emission reductions fail to materialize. Modeling {{studies have shown that}} there are trade-offs between changes in temperature and hydrological cycle in response to solar geoengineering. Here we investigate the possibility of stabilizing both global mean temperature and precipitation simultaneously by combining two geoengineering approaches: stratospheric sulfate aerosol increase (SAI) that deflects sunlight to space and cirrus cloud thinning (CCT) that enables more longwave radiation to escape to space. Using the slab ocean configuration of National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Earth System Model, we simulate SAI by uniformly adding sulfate aerosol in the upper stratosphere and CCT by uniformly increasing cirrus cloud ice particle falling speed. Under an idealized warming scenario of abrupt quadrupling of atmospheric CO 2, we show that by combining appropriate amounts of SAI and CCT geoengineering, global mean (or land mean) temperature and precipitation can be restored simultaneously to preindustrial levels. However, compared to SAI, cocktail geoengineering by mixing SAI and CCT does not markedly improve the overall similarity between geoengineered climate and preindustrial climate on regional scales. Some optimal spatially nonuniform mixture of SAI with CCT might have the potential to better mitigate climate change at both the global and regional scales. Plain Language Summary Increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide cause increase in both global temperatures and precipitation. Solar geoengineering {{has been proposed}} as a means to counteract this climate change by deliberately deflecting more sunlight from the Earth's climate system. Numerous climate modeling studies have shown that proposed solar geoengineering schemes, such as injection of sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere, can cool climate, but the amount of precipitation change per degree of temperature change is greater than that for CO 2, meaning that such proposals cannot simultaneously globally restore both average temperatures and average precipitation. It has also been suggested that the Earth could be cooled by thinning cirrus clouds, but the amount of precipitation change per degree of temperature change for this method is less than that for CO 2. Our climate modeling study shows, for the first time, that a cocktail of these two approaches would decrease precipitation and temperature in the same ratios as they are increased by CO 2, which would allow simultaneous recovery of <b>preindustrial</b> <b>temperature</b> and precipitation in a high CO 2 world at global scale. We show that although the average temperatures and precipitation can be recovered at global scale, substantial differences between the geoengineered and natural climates persist at regional scale...|$|R
40|$|We analyze sea ice {{changes from}} eight {{different}} earth system models that have conducted experiment abrupt 4 xCO 2 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP 5). In response to abrupt quadrupling of CO 2 from <b>preindustrial</b> levels, Arctic <b>temperatures</b> dramatically rise by about 10 °C— 16 °C {{in winter and}} the seasonal sea ice cycle and sea ice concentration are significantly changed compared with the pre-industrial control simulations (piControl). Changes of Arctic sea ice concentration are spatially correlated with temperature patterns in all seasons and highest in autumn. Changes in sea ice are associated with changes in atmospheric circulation patterns at heights up to the jet stream. While the pattern of sea level pressure changes is generally similar to the surface air temperature change pattern, the wintertime 500 hPa circulation displays a positive Pacific North America (PNA) anomaly under abrupt 4 xCO 2 -piControl. This large scale teleconnection may contribute to, or feedback on, the simulated sea ice cover change and is associated with an intensification of the jet stream over East Asia and the north Pacific in winter...|$|R
40|$|Past {{temperature}} variations {{are usually}} inferred from proxy data or estimated using general circulation models. Comparisons between climate estimations derived from proxy records and from model simulations help {{to better understand}} mechanisms driving climate variations, and also offer the possibility to identify deficiencies in both approaches. This paper presents regional temperature reconstructions based on tree-ring maximum density series in the Pyrenees, and compares them with the output of global simulations for this region and with regional climate model simulations conducted for the target region. An ensemble of 24 reconstructions of May-to-September regional mean temperature was derived from 22 maximum density tree-ring site chronologies distributed over the larger Pyrenees area. Four different tree-ring series standardization procedures were applied, combining two detrending methods: 300 -yr spline and the regional curve standardization (RCS). Additionally, different methodological variants for the regional chronology were generated by using three different aggregation methods. Calibration verification trials were performed in split periods and using two methods: regression and a simple variance matching. The resulting set of temperature reconstructions was compared with climate simulations performed with global (ECHO-G) and regional (MM 5) climate models. The 24 variants of May-to-September temperature reconstructions reveal a generally coherent pattern of inter-annual to multi-centennial temperature variations in the Pyrenees region for the last 750 yr. However, some reconstructions display a marked positive trend for {{the entire length of}} the reconstruction, pointing out that the application of the RCS method to a suboptimal set of samples may lead to unreliable results. Climate model simulations agree with the tree-ring based reconstructions at multi-decadal time scales, suggesting solar variability and volcanism as the main factors controlling <b>preindustrial</b> mean <b>temperature</b> variations in the Pyrenees. Nevertheless, the comparison also highlights differences with the reconstructions, mainly in the amplitude of past temperature variations and in the 20 th century trends. Neither proxy-based reconstructions nor model simulations are able to perfectly track the temperature variations of the instrumental record, suggesting that both approximations still need further improvements...|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{role of the}} {{hydrological cycle}} in the global climate system motivates a thorough evaluation of its responses to climate change and mitigation. The Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP) is a coordinated international effort to assess the climate impacts of solar geoengineering, a proposal to counteract global warming with a reduction in incoming solar radiation. We assess the mechanisms underlying the rainfall response to a simplified simulation of such solar dimming (G 1) in the suite of GeoMIP models and identify robust features. While solar geoengineering nearly restores <b>preindustrial</b> <b>temperatures,</b> the global hydrology is altered. Tropical precipitation changes dominate the response across the model suite, and these are driven primarily by shifts of the Hadley circulation cells. We report a damping of the seasonal migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in G 1, associated with preferential cooling of the summer hemisphere, and annual mean ITCZ shifts in some models that are correlated with the warming of one hemisphere relative to the other. Dynamical changes better explain the varying tropical rainfall anomalies between models than changes in relative humidity or the Clausius–Clapeyron scaling of precipitation minus evaporation (P [*]−[*] E), given that the relative humidity and temperature responses are robust across the suite. Strong reductions in relative humidity over vegetated land regions are likely related to the CO 2 physiological response in plants. The uncertainty in the spatial distribution of tropical P [*]−[*] E changes highlights the need for cautious consideration and continued study before any implementation of solar geoengineering...|$|E
40|$|The {{observed}} {{increase in}} the concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) since the preindustrial era has most likely committed the world to a warming of 2. 4 °C (1. 4 °C to 4. 3 °C) above the preindustrial surface temperatures. The committed warming is inferred from the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates of the greenhouse forcing and climate sensitivity. The estimated warming of 2. 4 °C is the equilibrium warming above <b>preindustrial</b> <b>temperatures</b> that the world will observe even if GHG concentrations are held fixed at their 2005 concentration levels but without any other anthropogenic forcing such as the cooling effect of aerosols. The range of 1. 4 °C to 4. 3 °C in the committed warming overlaps and surpasses the currently perceived threshold range of 1 °C to 3 °C for dangerous anthropogenic interference {{with many of the}} climate-tipping elements such as the summer arctic sea ice, Himalayan–Tibetan glaciers, and the Greenland Ice Sheet. IPCC models suggest that ≈ 25 % (0. 6 °C) of the committed warming has been realized as of now. About 90 % or more {{of the rest of the}} committed warming of 1. 6 °C will unfold during the 21 st century, determined by the rate of the unmasking of the aerosol cooling effect by air pollution abatement laws and by the rate of release of the GHGs-forcing stored in the oceans. The accompanying sea-level rise can continue for more than several centuries. Lastly, even the most aggressive CO 2 mitigation steps as envisioned now can only limit further additions to the committed warming, but not reduce the already committed GHGs warming of 2. 4 °C...|$|E
