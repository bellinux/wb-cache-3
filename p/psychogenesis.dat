He thus rejects the overrated <b>psychogenesis</b> of Freudian complexes, which have been presented as structural [...] "Universals" [...] of subjectivity.

[...] "There is only one way in which our minds can integrate into a coherent picture of noogenesis these two essential properties of the autonomous centre of all centres, and that is to resume and complement our Principle of Emergence." [...] "The idea is that of noogenesis ascending irreversibly towards Omega through the strictly limited cycle of a geogenesis."

The lack of any kind of definition of the term has led to a variety of interpretations reflected in the book, including [...] "the contemporary period of evolution on Earth, signified by transformation of biosphere onto the sphere of intelligence - noosphere", [...] "evolution run by human mind" [...] etc.The most widespread interpretation is thought to be [...] "the emergence of mind, which follows geogenesis, biogenesis and anthropogenesis, forming a new sphere on Earth - noosphere." ...|$|E

Studies of two research samples (shelter and community) were identified and assessed (rated) along four methodological dimensions (sample, instrumentation, statistical analysis, and hypothesis testing). Each was assigned a total design quality score, and the studies were then divided into three groups according to the overall level of design quality (high, medium, low).

40|$|A pesquisa tem como objetivo traçar um paralelismo entre o desenvolvimento histórico de um conceito, o de escrita do ritmo musical, na história da música e na psicogênese da notação musical. Ao mesmo tempo esta pesquisa contesta a visão de paralelismo entre a ontogênese e a filogênese, jamais proposta por Piaget. Esta pesquisa se apóia na redefinição das etapas estipuladas por Piaget para o desenvolvimento de um conceito, abandonando a tradicional sucessão de quatro estágios divulgada hoje em dia. O reconhecimento da seqüência de etapas intraobjetal, interobjetal e transobjetal, que acontece tanto na história das ciências como na psicogênese desses conceitos, representa a descrição de um processo no qual os mecanismos pelos quais o desenvolvimento cognitivo e a construção conceitual se realizam.

40|$|Women's somatic {{complaints}} {{are more likely}} to be labeled by physicians and other health care professionals as psychologically based when the condition has an obscure etiology. Perhaps because of this, there are a number of medical conditions which have been underinvestigated and where erroneous assumptions about them exist. Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) [...] severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy [...] is an example of such an illness. HG remains a puzzling condition for both physicians and patients because there is no known cause or cure. By its very nature, HG has a clearly established biological cause [...] pregnancy. Yet, because the exact causal pathophysiological mechanism is unknown, the organicity of the pregnant state is either minimized or ignored. This paper examines how HG is characterized in the literature and the empirical basis for <b>psychogenesis.</b> Analysis of the literature reveals a tension in the discourse such that both biologic and psychologic approaches to HG have existed in parallel tracks throughout history. Still, results support that sociocultural factors rather than scientific evidence have shaped the overarching and predominant illness paradigm of <b>psychogenesis.</b> Implications for women's health care and HG, in particular, are presented.

40|$|General {{practitioners}} {{are important to}} the delivery of mental health care because they perform three important functions, as an identifier, as a referral agent and as a caregiver. This study investigates the importance of the attitudes G. P. s hold on their performance of two of these functions. screening and referring. Relying on items developed in previous investigations, four measures of attitudinal dimensions are developed using factor analysis: Belief in <b>Psychogenesis,</b> Psychiatric Fatalism, Referral Reluctance and G. P. as Caregiver. These attitude dimensions are then related to the functions of screening and referral. Three major findings emerge from the results. First, the attitudinal dimensions uncovered are empirically distinct, suggesting that no single pro-to-anti psychiatry is present. Second, attitudes {{play a role in the}} screening of cases. A G. P. is more likely to identify cases if he believes in the <b>psychogenesis</b> of physical disorders, and is not concerned that identification and referral will lead to negative consequences for the patient. Third and finally, attitudes do not play a strong role in the referral of cases once they have been identified as such. The findings are presented and interpreted by referring to the sensitive position G. P. s occupy between the public and the psychiatrist. ...|$|E

For the majority of observers we find a systematic dependence of depth order of these half-images on their hue and/or brightness difference. After minor cleaning of the data, we are left with two mutually well-separated clusters. Correlation with the statistical distribution of hue and brightness in generic “open landscape” photographs reveals that one cluster correlates with hue, the other with brightness. This suggests that human observers indeed at least partly rely on “generic landscape” templates in the <b>psychogenesis</b> of their visual awareness. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Theories {{of organic}} evolution, mainly those {{proposed}} by Darwin, have strongly influenced human sciences in general, and psychology in particular. Piaget has brought from biology several theoretical proposals which gave support to his formulations concerning human ontogenetic development. The theoretical link between biological and psychological formulations {{was based on}} the proposition of correspondences and partial isomorphism between evolutionary biology and cognitive development. However, Piaget's ideas about phylogenetic evolution of live organisms have had little influence over current biology. Nevertheless, epigenetic contemporary theories of biological evolution make use of Piaget's propositions, in theoretical opposition to the neo-Darwinist views. Because of that, it is proposed in this paper the crucial contribution of Piaget in terms of the proposition of a common theoretical ground for <b>psychogenesis</b> and organic evolution...|$|E
40|$|Meanings and {{qualities are}} {{fundamental}} attributes of visual awareness. We propose eidolons {{as a tool}} for establishing equivalence classes of appearance along meaningful dimensions. The eidolon factory is an algorithm that generates stimuli in such a meaningful and transparent way. The algorithm allows us to focus on location, scale, and size of perceptually salient structures, proto-objects, and perhaps even semantics rather than global overall parameters, such as contrast and spatial frequency. The eidolon factory is based on models of the <b>psychogenesis</b> of visual awareness. It affects the image in terms of the disruption of image structure across space and spatial scales. This is a very general method with many potential applications. We illustrate a few instances.

The hypothesis put forward is that the literary authorship regime established far from critical mediation spaces, with no granted awards and seals for school use, changes the national paradigm for the transnational. It starts by commenting on the engagement and recognition of large communities of readers organized on social networks. New issues emerge in the creation process, plot and narrative structure of the novels, as well as regarding the autonomy of the readers in choosing illegitimately their book and in following, for years, far from the school system, the adventures of recurring heroes.

40|$|In {{this pilot}} study {{hypnosis}} {{was used in}} an attempt to provide evidence of a psychogenic component of pseudo-epileptic seizures. The criterion for <b>psychogenesis</b> was the reversal of the amnesia, which is often present in epileptic- and pseudo-epileptic seizures. The technique has been validated by a semi-blind referral of cases for analysis after the clinician had been able to make a firm diagnosis based on electro-encephalic corroboration {{of the nature of the}} seizure. In eight out of nine patients (of the original 13 patients, three patients dropped out and one patient was not evaluable), the experimental diagnosis corresponded with the clinical diagnosis. As pseudo-epileptic seizures can be characterized by their dissociative nature, a reasonable hypothesis is that patients with pseudo-epileptic seizures are more responsive to hypnosis than patients with epileptic seizures. Measurement of hypnotizability among seven patients with epileptic seizures and six patients with pseudo-epileptic seizures supported this supposition...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the familiar {{phenomenon of the}} uncanny feeling that represented people in frontal pose invariably appear to "face you" from wherever you stand. We deploy two different methods. The stimuli include the conventional one-a flat portrait {{rocking back and forth}} about a vertical axis-augmented with two novel variations. In one alternative, the portrait frame rotates whereas the actual portrait stays motionless and fronto-parallel; in the other, we replace the (flat!) portrait with a volumetric object. These variations yield exactly the same optical stimulation in frontal view, but become grossly different in very oblique views. We also let participants sample their momentary awareness through "gauge object" settings in static displays. From our results, we conclude that the <b>psychogenesis</b> of visual awareness maintains a number-at least two, but most likely more-of distinct spatial frameworks simultaneously involving "cue-scission. " Cues may be effective in one of these spatial frameworks but ineffective or functionally different in other ones...|$|E
