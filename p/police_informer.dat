5|$|People {{struggled}} to survive together, and a rich culture based on shebeens (informal and mostly illegal pubs), mbaqanga music and beer-brewing developed. The shebeens {{were one of}} the main forms of entertainment. People came to the shebeens not only for skokiaan or baberton (illegally self-made alcoholic beverages), but to talk about their daily worries, their political ideas and their fears and hopes. In these shebeens the politicians tried to influence others and get them to conform to their form of thinking. If one disagreed he immediately became suspect and was classified as a <b>police</b> <b>informer.</b>|$|E

5|$|On {{the basis}} of Vitozzi's {{declarations}} and the testimony of Giacomo Ascrittore, a regular <b>police</b> <b>informer</b> {{and member of the}} Camorra, the local police and judiciary of Naples identified Gaetano Amodeo and Tommaso De Angelis as the real killers. However, the murder investigation was transferred to the Carabinieri and delegated to Captain Carlo Fabbroni. Fabbroni accused the Naples police of inefficiency and corruption. The investigation got new momentum when Gennaro Abbatemaggio, a young camorrista and a former Carabinieri informer serving a jail sentence in Naples, testified that the decision to kill Cuocolo, suspected of being a police spy, had been taken at a meeting at the restaurant chaired by Alfano. The developments of the case and suspected police corruption were discussed in parliament several times.|$|E

In a 2006 article, some of Verdonk's friends and colleagues from her Nijmegen days expressed surprise at Verdonk's radical switch in political orientation after graduating in 1983. Some observed that Verdonk had never held outspoken left-wing ideals and criticized communist regimes; others hypothesized that it was part of a growing-up phase; a former treasurer of the BWO suspected that Verdonk had been a <b>police</b> <b>informer</b> all those years.|$|E

25|$|A {{search of}} Chikatilo's {{belongings}} revealed {{he had been}} in possession of a folding knife and two lengths of rope. A sample of Chikatilo's blood was taken, and he was placed in a cell inside the KGB headquarters in Rostov with a <b>police</b> <b>informer,</b> who was instructed to engage Chikatilo in conversation and elicit any information he could from him. The next day, 21 November, formal questioning of Chikatilo began. The interrogation was performed by Issa Kostoyev. The strategy chosen by the police to elicit a confession was to lead Chikatilo to believe that he was a very sick man in need of medical help. The intention was to give Chikatilo hope that if he confessed, he would not be prosecuted by reason of insanity. Police knew their case against Chikatilo was largely circumstantial, and under Soviet law, they had 10 days in which they could legally hold a suspect before either charging or releasing him.|$|E

500|$|Upon the {{dismissal}} of Heiden, Himmler assumed the position of Reichsführer-SS with Hitler's approval in January 1929. There are differing accounts {{of the reason for}} this dismissal. The party merely announced that it was for [...] "family reasons". It was also suggested at the time that {{the dismissal}} was due to Heiden associating with Jews. [...] Since 1928, Heiden was co-owner of a clothing supply business that sold uniforms to the SS. Another company in Munich supplied Heiden and his partner with the pants which were used for the SS uniforms. It was discovered that this other company was owned by a Jew. Further, it was alleged that Heiden had been making large profits on the clothing sales to the SS for uniforms. This led to Heiden having to resign as head of the SS. Historian Adrian Weale says that the dismissal was probably because he was ineffective in the job, but there also were rumors that he was a <b>police</b> <b>informer.</b> Himmler's biographer Peter Longerich says that beyond the official announcement [...] "we have no further clues to explain either Heiden's dismissal or Himmler's appointment". Under Himmler the SS greatly expanded over time, with his ultimate aim being the one to turn it into the most powerful organization in Germany.|$|E

According to an IRA Intelligence officer, Wright had been specifically selected and trained by the Northern Ireland security forces to take over the role as key player in Mid-Ulster from former brigadier and alleged Special Branch agent Robin Jackson. Larkin had made a film in 1996 for BBC's Spotlight current affairs programme about the activities of Wright and his unit entitled Rat Pack. It was broadcast on 8 October of that year.|$|E
2500|$|During the conflict, the IRA took on {{the role}} of {{policing}} in some Catholic/nationalist areas of Northern Ireland. Many Catholics/nationalists did not trust the official police force—the Royal Ulster Constabulary—and saw it as biased against their community. The RUC found it difficult to operate in certain nationalist neighbourhoods and only entered in armoured convoys, due to the threat of attack from rioters and the IRA. In these neighbourhoods, many residents expected the IRA to act as a policing force, and such policing [...] "provided the IRA a certain propaganda value". The IRA also sought to minimize contact between residents and the RUC, because residents might pass on information or be forced to become a <b>police</b> <b>informer.</b> The IRA set up arbitration panels that would adjudicate and investigate complaints from locals about criminal or 'anti-social' activities. Those responsible for minor offences would be given a warning, be made to compensate the offendee, or be made to do community work. Those responsible for more serious and repeat offences could be given a punishment beating or kneecapping, or be banished from the community.|$|E
2500|$|Kelly and {{his gang}} eluded the police for two years, {{thanks in part to}} the support of an {{extensive}} network of sympathisers.
