50|$|The <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> (POB) is {{the place}} where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, {{together}} with name and date <b>of</b> <b>birth,</b> to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> is determined to be country that currently has sovereignty over the actual <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> regardless <b>of</b> when the <b>birth</b> actually occurred. The <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth.</b> In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> the new baby is registered in the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth.</b>|$|R

40|$|Aim: This study {{sought to}} examine whether the <b>place</b> and date <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> elite youth Irish footballers {{influences}} their selection onto the Football Association of Ireland's primary development pathway; 12 regional centres of excellences called the “Emerging Talent Programme” (ETP). The proposed hypothesis was that players born {{earlier in the year}} would be over-represented compared to those born later in their age band. A secondary hypothesis was that access to the ETP would be independent <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth.</b> Methods: The dates and <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> all elite youth footballers (n = 1936) selected onto the ETP since its inception were examined. χ 2 tests were used to establish if the dates <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> differed from the expected population distribution. Odds ratios were used to identify spatial variation in relation to <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> and talent production. Results: The results showed that admission to the ETP is not independent <b>of</b> quarter <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> (P. 05, χ 2 = 256. 817, w =. 388). <b>Place</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> analysis showed an unequal geographical distribution of players gaining selection onto the ETP. Selection onto the ETP was not independent <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> (P <. 05, χ 2 = 149. 457, w =. 278). Footballers developed in counties that had an ETP centre were almost 50 % more likely to gain selection than those without a centre (OR 1. 455, 95 % CI 1. 314 - 1. 612). Conclusion: The current programme demonstrates inequitable distribution of opportunities to access elite development pathways due to biases related to date and <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth...</b>|$|R
