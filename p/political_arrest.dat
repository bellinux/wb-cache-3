5000|$|Ofehe's {{life was}} under threat {{again when he}} {{narrowly}} escaped a bomb blast that rocked his room at the government guest house in Delta State, Nigeria. He was subsequently arrested by the Nigeria State Security Services. In February 2011, he was arrested by the Dutch Police after around 30 officers raided his home in Rotterdam {{in the early hours}} of the morning and detained for 14 days. He was later charged with terrorism in a case that became so widely reported around the world and attracted international condemnation. [...] It became obvious that Ofehe had been a victim of a <b>political</b> <b>arrest</b> to silence his dogged and virile criticism of oil and government operations in the Niger Delta. The charges against him were later dropped for lack of evidence.|$|E
50|$|In 1924, the PNF won the {{election}} with 65 per cent of the votes; yet the United Socialist Party refused to accept such a defeat - especially Deputy Giacomo Matteotti who, on 30 May 1924, in Parliament formally accused the PNF of electoral fraud, and reiterated his denunciations of PNF Blackshirt political violence, and was publishing The Fascisti Exposed: A Year of Fascist Domination, a book substantiating his accusations. Consequently, on 24 June 1924, the Ceka (ostensibly a party secret police, modelled on the Soviet Cheka) assassinated the Parliament Deputy; of the five men arrested, Amerigo Dumini, aka Il Sicario del Duce (The Leader's Assassin), was sentenced to five years' imprisonment, yet served only eleven months, and was freed under amnesty from King Victor Emmanuel III. Moreover, when the King supported Prime Minister Mussolini, the socialists quit Parliament in protest, leaving the Fascists to govern unopposed. In that time, assassination was not yet the modus operandi norm; the Italian Fascist Duce usually disposed of opponents in the Imperial Roman way: <b>political</b> <b>arrest</b> punished with island banishment.|$|E

25|$|In the 1930s, Soviet {{authorities}} took {{measures to}} control and curtail aspects of Ukrainian culture (see Russification) they deemed unsuitable.
