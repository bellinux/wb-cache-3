Mulder tells Scully {{the news of the}} therapist's death and urges her to keep Linda away from a <b>phone.</b> <b>At</b> the safe house, Skinner finds Linda's room door locked. He kicks the door down to find Modell and Linda, with Modell calmly saying that he has a gun.

5|$|Some {{time after}} 7:00pm, a Woodsville, New Hampshire {{resident}} {{heard a loud}} thump outside of her house. Through her window she could see a car up against the snowbank along Route 112, also known as Wild Ammonoosuc Road. The car pointed west on the eastbound side of the road. She telephoned the Grafton County Sheriff's Department at 7:27pm to report the accident. According to the 911 log, the woman claimed to have seen a man smoking a cigarette inside the car. However, the woman later stated {{that she had not}} seen a man nor a person smoking a cigarette, but rather had seen {{what appeared to be a}} red light glowing from inside the car, potentially from a cell <b>phone.</b> <b>At</b> about the same time another neighbor saw the car as well as someone walking around the vehicle. She witnessed a third neighbor pull up alongside the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of Sunday 8 May to Monday 9 May 1977, about 100 people were staying in the Hotel Polen, {{including}} {{a large group of}} Swedish tourists. About 6:20am, the hotel staff were preparing for breakfast service, when one of them noticed smoke that seemed to be coming from the freight elevator (which had not been used since the café-restaurant on the ground floor had closed the previous evening). The night porter was alerted. Contrary to instructions, he did not call the fire department immediately; instead, he poured some buckets of water into the shaft, in an attempt to subdue the fire. By the time he decided to call the fire department, the hotel was filling with smoke. The night porter was unable to reach the <b>phone</b> <b>at</b> the front desk because the fire had already reached it. The porter then ran outside, where he stopped the driver of a laundry truck serving the hotel, and instructed him to drive to the Hotel Krasnapolsky to warn them and to call the fire department.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of this {{vertical}} monopoly, by 1940 the Bell System effectively owned most telephone service in the United States, from local and long-distance service to the telephones themselves. This allowed Bell to prohibit its customers from connecting phones not made or sold by Bell to the system without paying fees. For example, if a customer desired a type of phone not leased by the local Bell monopoly, he or she had to purchase the <b>phone</b> <b>at</b> cost, give it to the phone company, then pay a 're-wiring' charge and a monthly lease fee in order to use it.|$|E

When she caught up to it, Cowlings yelled out that Simpson {{was in the back}} seat of the vehicle and had a gun to his own head. The officer backed off, but followed the vehicle at , with up to 20 police cars following him in the chase.|$|E
25|$|Nokia also {{acquired}} Mobira, {{a mobile}} telephony company, {{which was the}} foundation of its future mobile phones business. In 1981, Mobira launched the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) service, the world's first international cellular network {{and the first to}} allow international roaming. In 1982, Mobira launched the Mobira Senator car phone, Nokia's first mobile <b>phone.</b> <b>At</b> that time, the company had no interest in producing mobile phones, which the executive board regarded as akin to James Bond's gadgets - improbably futuristic and niche devices. After all these acquisitions Nokia's revenue base became US$2.7 billion. Tragically CEO Kairamo committed suicide on 11 December 1988.|$|E

25|$|Ndonye accused {{five men}} of raping {{her on the}} morning of September 13, 2009. She stated that they had stolen her cell <b>phone</b> <b>at</b> a college party and then used it to lure her into a {{bathroom}} stall where they tied her down and took turns raping her as she screamed. She claimed she tried to call for help not realizing all five men were together. The four of the five men were arrested, held on $350,000 bail, spent three days in jail under protective custody, and all charged with first-degree rape, which carries a possible 25 year sentence. Rondell Bedward was also suspended from Hofstra.|$|E
25|$|On 25 September, closed-circuit {{television}} (CCTV) video was handed to and then released by Victoria Police. The video was handed {{to them by}} {{an employee of the}} Duchess Boutique, a bridal shop based on Sydney Road near Hope Street. It had been recorded from within the shop but had a limited view of the street through its front windows. It thus showed her speaking to a man in a blue hoodie at around 1:42 am on the night she disappeared. At one point she brandishes her mobile <b>phone</b> <b>at</b> him. The man had also been filmed walking outside the shop four minutes earlier. This was the last known time that Meagher was captured on camera.|$|E
25|$|Tender is {{a member}} of the fanatical Creedish cult, which engaged in a mass suicide ten years previously. He is one of the Creedish members who was sent out into the world to work as a servant, and send his income back to the Creedish community. Creedish members have been {{steadily}} killing themselves since the mass suicide, in keeping with their belief that the deliverance is at hand. At the start of his story, Tender works as the housekeeper for a rich couple he never sees in Oregon. They issue directions via a daily planner and a speaker <b>phone.</b> <b>At</b> his dingy apartment, he gets phone calls from people who want to kill themselves - the result of a newspaper misprint which printed his phone number as the number for a suicide prevention hotline. Tender, enjoying the thrill of passing divine judgment on these people tells them to kill themselves as often as not, and sees this as an act of mercy. Although the newspaper prints a retraction, the calls keep coming, and when they dwindle, Tender prints up fliers for a fake crisis hotline with his number on them so the calls will continue.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea for}} the show {{occurred}} to actor James Corden during a wedding reception, and he then developed the idea with co-writer Ruth Jones, whom he had met during the filming of ITV drama Fat Friends. Corden claims to {{have been inspired by}} the story of his own real life best friend Gavin, who met his wife over the <b>phone</b> <b>at</b> work, and arranged to meet. They presented it to the BBC as a one-off play, but the BBC instead asked for a full series. The roles of Gavin and Stacey were cast through an auditioning process, but were almost immediately given to Mathew Horne and Joanna Page on the strength of their chemistry together. The roles of Nessa and Smithy were written by Corden and Jones for themselves. Some roles were written with certain actors in mind; Uncle Bryn was written specifically for Rob Brydon, who had been to school with Jones, whilst Pam was written specifically for Alison Steadman, who had also worked on Fat Friends. Jones had worked with Julia Davis in her sitcom Nighty Night, and the role of Dawn was written with her in mind. Additionally, Corden had appeared with Adrian Scarborough in the Alan Bennett-penned play and film, The History Boys, which led to him being cast in the role of Pete. An audition process was used to cast the roles of Mick and Gwen, whilst the roles of Gavin's friends were given to Corden's co-stars in The History Boys.|$|E
500|$|A police {{negotiator}} contacted [...] by <b>phone</b> <b>at</b> 13:07.

[...] Despite this, {{and the fact that}} Fred alone had over 1000 lines of in-game dialog, the recording went smoothly, {{with the exception of one}} unidentified actor who walked out in the middle of a session. [...] The original script had only one instance of the word [...] "fuck", but several recording sessions with McGinley resulted in a great deal of colorful improvisation. [...] The design team liked the recordings and the script was modified to permit McGinley and other actors to curse more. [...] McGinley focused on portraying Fred as [...] "pissed off" [...] and [...] "having a chip on his shoulder" [...] because his head was missing.|$|E

500|$|Wu {{was known}} for posting humorous videos on YouTube. When Wu's [...] "I Have to Deal With Stereotypes" [...] video was {{featured}} on YouTube's home page, his number of viewers began to increase. In this video, Wu talks about stereotypes he {{has to deal with}} as an Asian-American. He tries to disprove his cheapness by bragging about the recent purchase of a [...] "brand new, top-of-the-line, TI-84 calculator". He acknowledges that this might make him nerdy but dismisses this stereotype too as he does not [...] "make all A's...in school today [...] made a B+." [...] He is then greeted by a voice {{that was supposed to be}} his mother calling him a loser and accusing him of dishonoring their family. Wu goes on to say he can prove his predominant social life with the constant ringing of his cell <b>phone.</b> <b>At</b> this point, his phone indeed rings, he answers it, and the voice on the other end to Wu's disappointment says, [...] "Hey, why did you tell me to call you?" [...] Wu has collaborated with fellow YouTube comedian Christine Gambito (HappySlip), making five videos with her. In one of Kevin's older videos, he said he was an only child, which was later proven wrong by his father.|$|E
500|$|Apart from Mike Schmidt, Jeremy Fitzgerald, Fritz Smith, and Michael (a {{character}} {{whose voice}} is heard in Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location), {{none of the}} other human characters in the series have any real, or at least confirmed, names. In the first three games, a man simply identified as [...] "Phone Guy" [...] leaves a recording over the <b>phone</b> <b>at</b> the beginning of each night which serves as advice to the player {{on how to deal with}} the animatronics. Phone Guy is present through all five nights of Five Nights at Freddy's 2, four of the main nights in Five Nights at Freddy's, and four of the main nights in Five Nights at Freddy's 3 (as well as in Night 6 for the second and third games.) He is not present in the fourth and fifth games, though his first night recording from the original game is sometimes played backwards as ambiance in Five Nights at Freddy's 4. His call at the start of Night 4 in Five Nights at Freddy's implies that he was killed by the animatronics. In the third game, he is heard over archival recordings discovered by the creators of Fazbear's Fright. Sister Location instead features a human A.I. named [...] "HandUnit", who like Phone Guy, acts as a tutor to the player. [...] The first two nights of the third game also feature [...] "Phone Dude", one of the creators of Fazbear's Fright.|$|E
