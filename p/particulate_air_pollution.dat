The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the association between exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a selected group of chemicals present in particulate matter and tobacco smoke, and measures of cognitive performance among elderly in the general population. This cross-sectional analysis involved data from 454 individuals aged 60 years and older from the 2001 - 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The association between PAH exposures (as measured by urinary biomarkers) and cognitive function (digit symbol substitution test (DSST)) was assessed using multiple linear regression analyses. After adjusting for age, socio-economic status and diabetes we observed a negative association between urinary 1 -hydroxypyrene, the gold standard of PAH exposure biomarkers, and DSST score. A one percent increase in urinary 1 -hydroxypyrene resulted in approximately a 1. 8 percent poorer performance on the digit symbol substitution test. Our findings are consistent with previous publications and further suggest that PAHs, at least in part may be responsible for the adverse cognitive effects linked to tobacco smoke and <b>particulate</b> matter <b>air</b> <b>pollution...</b>|$|R
25|$|Two-ring PAHs, and to {{a lesser}} extent three-ring PAHs, {{dissolve}} in water, making them more available for biological uptake and degradation. Further, two- to four-ring PAHs volatilize sufficiently to appear in the atmosphere predominantly in gaseous form, although the physical state of four-ring PAHs can depend on temperature. In contrast, compounds with five or more rings have low solubility in water and low volatility; they are therefore predominantly in solid state, bound to <b>particulate</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollution,</b> soils, or sediments. In solid state, these compounds are less accessible for biological uptake or degradation, increasing their persistence in the environment.|$|E
25|$|Air pollution, or {{suspended}} particulate matter locally generated from the increased number of automobiles in the area, from point sources such as factories, dust carried into the air by construction activity, and the contribution of similar pollutants from the Los Angeles area has regularly caused the Inland Empire to be at, or near, the bottom of many air quality ratings. In 2004, the EPA rated the San Bernardino-Riverside area as having the worst <b>particulate</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> in the United States, (although the San Joaquin Valley in central California had the worst overall air pollution). Air pollution in the Los Angeles region is still an issue, although improvements have been made over the years. But the problem is exacerbated in the Inland Empire, which is surrounded by mountains on {{the north and the}} east. Prevailing winds move bad air eastward from Los Angeles, but once the pollution reaches the Inland Empire it cannot be carried further east as it becomes trapped by the mountains surrounding the region.|$|E

Strong epidemiological evidence suggests that exposure to <b>particulate</b> matter (PM) <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> causes exacerbations of pre-existing lung conditions, such as, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. However, little is known whether a chronic, low-grade exposure to ambient PM can cause the development and progression of COPD. The deposition of PM in the respiratory tract depends predominantly on the size of the particles, with larger particles deposited in the upper and larger airways and smaller particles penetrating deep into the alveolar spaces. Ineffective clearance of this PM from the airways could cause particle retention in lung tissues, resulting in a chronic, low-grade inflammatory response that may be pathogenetically important in both the exacerbation, as well as, the progression of lung disease. This review focuses on the adverse effects of exposure to ambient PM <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> on the exacerbation, progression, and development of COPD.

The exposome {{has been proposed}} to complement the genome and be the totality of all environmental exposures of an individual over his or her lifetime.

Third, functional genomic changes are likely in many instances to be both a susceptibility factor and a marker of internal doses in response to environmental exposures. Fourth, internal dose measurements of environmental exposures might have lost the distinct signature of the relevant sources. This paper emphasises the obligation of environmental epidemiology to provide robust evidence to assist timely and sufficient protection of vulnerable subgroups of populations from environmental hazards. Therefore, in applying the exposome concept to environmental health problems, a strong link with the external environment needs to be maintained...|$|R

40|$|This study uses sharp, {{differential}} {{air quality}} changes across sites attributable to geographic {{variation in the}} effects of the 1981 - 82 recession to estimate the relationship between infant mortality and <b>particulates</b> <b>air</b> <b>pollution.</b> It is shown that in the narrow period of 1980 - 82, there was substantial variation across counties in changes in particulates pollution, and that these differential pollution reductions appear to be orthogonal to changes in a multitude of other factors that may be related to infant mortality. Using the most detailed and comprehensive data available, we find that a 1 mg/m 3 reduction in particulates results in about 4 - 8 fewer infant deaths per 100, 000 (a 0. 35 - 0. 45 elasticity). The estimated effects are driven almost entirely by fewer deaths occurring within one month and one day of birth, suggesting that fetal exposure to pollution has adverse health consequences. The estimated effects of the pollution reductions on infant birth weight provide evidence consistent with this potential pathophysiologic mechanism. The analysis also reveals a nonlinear relationship between pollution and infant mortality at the county level. Importantly, the estimates are remarkably stable across a variety of specifications. All of these findings are masked in conventional' analyses based on less credible research designs. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{shape of}} the {{dose-response}} relation between <b>particulate</b> matter <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> and mortality is crucial for public health assessment, and departures of this relation from linearity could have important regulatory consequences. A number of investigators have studied the {{shape of the}} particulate matter-mortality dose-response relation and concluded that the relation could be adequately described by a linear model. Some of these researchers examined the hypothesis of linearity by comparing Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) values obtained under linear, piece-wise linear, and spline alternative models. However, at the current time, the efficacy of the AIC in this context has not been assessed. The authors investigated AIC as a means of comparing competing dose-response models, using data from Cook County, Illinois, for the period 1987 – 2000. They found that if nonlinearities exist, the AIC is not always successful in detecting them. In a number of the scenarios considered, AIC was equivocal, picking the correct simulated dose-response model about half of the time.

Traffic is {{a major contributor to}} the <b>particulate</b> and gaseous <b>air</b> <b>pollution.</b> There are indications that hospital admissions, mortality and other less severe health effects are associated with <b>particulate</b> and gaseous <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> during episodes of winter-type smog. As an example an estimate has been made of the expected effects on daily health after exposure to extreme 24 h concentration of 230 microg/m 3 PM 10. The health impact varied for different endpoints, of which high and low values will be presented. During such an extreme episode acute mortality is expected to rise by approximately 20 %, while use of medication by asthmatic children is expected to rise threefold. Other health endpoints showed increases between these two. Current knowledge indicates that (even a modest) decrease in yearly average concentrations has a greater positive effect on health effects than stopping all traffic emissions in the Netherlands during such an extreme episode. Therefore a more permanent policy of curbing (traffic) <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> is probably more effective in reducing public health risks than a one-off termination of all urban traffic in the Netherlands during a winter-type smog episode...|$|R
