40|$|International audienceAn {{analysis}} was performed of the fracture networks in the N-S trending thick-skinned Malargüe fold and thrust belt (MFTB). A total of 2000 planar structures including joints and veins were measured in different structural domains ranging from surficial thin-skinned systems detached in the cover to large-scale structures such as basement-cored folds. The investigated stratigraphic section ranges from the Middle Jurassic (Cuyo Group) to the Paleocene (Malargüe Group), including sandstones, siltstones, shales, and limestones. Four main fracture sets are identified trending, E-W, NW-SE, NE-SW, and N-S. The abutting relationships provide a reliable chronology between the four fracture sets which are ubiquitously found in the MFTB throughout the various structural domains. Due to this observation, we assume the fracture signal to be regional and developed in response to both large-scale processes and folding. In particular, based on a fold test and the characteristics of data dispersion, the fracture sets I, II, and III exhibit a <b>prefolding</b> origin, while set IV shows a synfolding origin. A regional interpretation of the various fractures is proposed, involving several stages of fracture formation from compaction to folding, including <b>prefolding</b> layer parallel shortening. The fracture signal yields useful insights about the structural history of the MFTB and the spatiotemporal evolution of the foreland tectonic regime since Late Cretaceous times. We then place the various identified fracture sets into the known pattern of geodynamic evolution since the Late Cretaceous...|$|E
40|$|The first paleomagnetic {{data from}} Permian and Triassic {{formations}} {{west of the}} Andean divide are presented. Four formations of Permian or Triassic age in the central Chilean Andes have been investigated: two {{are located in the}} coastal ranges, and two are in the main cordillera. Of the formations in the main cordillera (Pastos Blancos and Matahuaico formations), only the Pastos Blancos Formation has yielded characteristic directions. While a fold test is absent, magnetizations are most likely secondary and yield pre-tilt corrected concordant inclinations, but yield declinations discordant 30 ° clockwise in comparison to the South American apparent polar wander path. Both formations from the coastal ranges (Cifuncho and Pichidangui formations) yielded stable directions. Postfolding magnetizations in the Cifuncho Formation also show declinations discordant 30 ° clockwise and concordant inclinations. The Pichidangui Formation has two stable components: one of postfolding age is concordant to apparent polar wander path data, and one of probable <b>prefolding</b> (Late Triassic) age is concordant in declination, but discordant in inclination. Further work is needed to better define the <b>prefolding</b> magnetizations in the Pichidangui Formation, but at present these preliminary results are the first paleomagnetic signs of displaced terranes along the Pacific margin of Chile. If correct, the results suggest that the Pichidangui Formation was some 15 ° of latitude farther south during the Late Triassic and had likely moved northward to its present latitudinal position with respect to cratonic South America by Middle to Late Jurassic...|$|E
40|$|The Tibetan Himalaya {{represents}} the northernmost continental {{unit of the}} Indian plate that collided with Asia in the Cenozoic. Paleomagnetic studies on the Tibetan Himalaya can help constrain the dimension and paleogeography of "Greater India," the Indian plate lithosphere that subducted and underthrusted below Asia after initial collision. Here we present a paleomagnetic investigation of a Jurassic (limestones) and Lower Cretaceous (volcaniclastic sandstones) section of the Tibetan Himalaya. The limestones yielded positive fold test, showing a <b>prefolding</b> origin of the isolated remanent magnetizations. Detailed paleomagnetic analyses, rock magnetic tests, end-member modeling of acquisition curves of isothermal remanent magnetization, and petrographic investigation reveal that the magnetic carrier of the Jurassic limestones is authigenic magnetite, whereas the dominant magnetic carrier of the Lower Cretaceous volcaniclastic sandstones is detrital magnetite. Our observations lead us {{to conclude that the}} Jurassic limestones record a <b>prefolding</b> remagnetization, whereas the Lower Cretaceous volcaniclastic sandstones retain a primary remanence. The volcaniclastic sandstones yield an Early Cretaceous paleolatitude of 55. 5 °S [52. 5 °S, 58. 6 °S] for the Tibetan Himalaya, suggesting {{it was part of the}} Indian continent at that time. The size of "Greater India" during Jurassic time cannot be estimated from these limestones. Instead, a paleolatitude of the Tibetan Himalaya of 23. 8 °S [21. 8 °S, 26. 1 °S] during the remagnetization process is suggested. It is likely that the remagnetization, caused by the oxidation of early diagenetic pyrite to magnetite, was induced during 103 - 83 or 77 - 67 Ma. The inferred paleolatitudes at these two time intervals imply very different tectonic consequences for the Tibetan Himalaya...|$|E

A secondary origin for the magnetizations is supported by negative fold tests in several units. A lower Carboniferous and possibly a lower Triassic limestone may have escaped the pervasive remagnetization; if the remanences isolated are indeed <b>prefolding,</b> a large counterclockwise tectonic rotation of the Nanjing area is implied by comparison with available Carboniferous and Triassic paleopoles reported from elsewhere in South China.

Two components of magnetization were isolated: a synfolding “B” component and the <b>prefolding</b> “C” component. The conglomerate test is positive, indicating that the C component was acquired {{very early in the}} history of the sediment. A coherent pattern of magnetic polarity reversals was identified. Five magnetozones were identified in the upper Lavelle section, which yields a pattern that is an excellent match with the pattern of reversals obtained from the upper Mauch Chunk at the original type section of the Mississippian/Pennsylvanian boundary at Pottsville, PA.

The dominant, thermally distributed component (SF), previously thought to predate folding, is demonstrably synfolding in origin. The mean direction for SF {{based on data from}} the current study and a previous study is Declination/Inclination = 161. 6 °/ 7. 9 °, a 95 = 3. 9 ° (pole position 127. 3 °E, 43. 1 °N, A 95 = 3. 1 °, N = 14 sites).

Above the fault tip, the fluids circulated rapidly in the diffuse synfolding (and early folding) fracture network. The zone of preferential migration of the warm fluids is currently located in the backlimb of the fold, which supports some of the previously published structural interpretation of the subsurface.

40|$|The {{internal}} ribosome site RNA of the cricket paralysis-like viruses (CrPV-like) binds {{directly to}} the ribosome, assembling the translation machinery without initiation factors. This mechanism does not require initiator tRNA, and translation starts from a non-AUG codon. A wealth of biochemical data has yielded a working model for this process, but the three-dimensional structure and biophysical characteristics of the unbound CrPV-like IRES RNAs are largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that the CrPV-like IRESes <b>prefold</b> into a two-part structure {{in the presence of}} magnesium ions.

This corresponds to 10 - 15 ° CW {{relative to the}} Lower Cretaceous Khorat Plateau VGP. The data also show 5 ° of northward transport relative to the 100 Ma South China VGP or 12 ° relative to the Khorat Lower Cretaceous VGP. Similar CW rotations are measured in remagnetized Palaeozoic arbonates in Peninsular Thailand and Langkawi Island, Malaysia. These block motions most likely took place between the Late Cretaceous and the Late Oligocene. These and other recently published ata have several implications for the extrusion tectonic model: (i) Sundaland has only rotated 25 - 30 ° CW relative to South China during the Tertiary; (ii) southeastward t anslation is only 300 - 500 kin; and (iii) Sundaland is composed of smaller sub-blocks, {{some of which have}} moved northward.

40|$|Experimental {{observations}} of how unfolded proteins refold to their native three-dimensional structures contrast with many popular theories of protein folding mechanisms. The available experimental evidence (ignoring slow cis-trans peptide bond isomerization) is largely {{consistent with the}} following general scheme: under folding conditions, unfolded protein molecules rapidly equilibrate between different conformations prior to complete refolding. This rapid <b>prefolding</b> equilibrium favors certain compact conformations that have somewhat lower free energies than the other unfolded conformations. Some of the favored conformations are important for productive folding. The rate-limiting step occurs late in the pathway and involves a high-energy, distorted form of the native conformation; {{there appears to be}} a single transition state through which essentially all molecules refold. Consequently, proteins are not assembled via a large number of independent pathways, nor is folding initiated by a nucleation event in the unfolded protein followed by rapid growth of the folded structure. The known folding pathways involving disulfide bond formation follow the same general principles. An exceptional folding mechanism for reduced ribonuclease A proposed by Scheraga et al. (Scheraga, H.

To this end, the structure and conformation of major ampullate gland silk fibroin within the glands of the spider N. clavipes were examined by 13 C NMR spectroscopy.

Conventionally, {{they have a}} square or rectangular section, either straight or tapered. Dents are sometimes added to the surface {{in order to reduce}} the initial buckling force. This paper presents a novel thin-walled energy absorption device known as the origami crash box that is made from a thin-walled tube of square cross section whose surface is <b>prefolded</b> according to a developable origami pattern. The <b>prefolded</b> surface serves both as a type of geometric imperfection to lower the initial buckling force and as a mode inducer to trigger a collapse mode that is more efficient in terms of energy absorption. It has been found out from quasi-static numerical simulation that a new collapse mode referred to as the completed diamond mode, which features doubled traveling plastic hinge lines compared with those in conventional square tubes, can be triggered, leading to higher energy absorption and lower peak force than those of conventional ones of identical weight. A parametric study indicates that for a wide range of geometric parameters the origami crash box exhibits predictable and stable collapse behavior, with an energy absorption increase of 92. 1 % being achieved in the optimum case. The origami crash box can be stamped out of a thin sheet of material like conventional energy absorption devices without incurring in-plane stretching due to the developable surface of the origami pattern.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the diagenetic history of dual (i. e. matrix and fracture) porosity reservoir lithologies in Cretaceous to Eocene carbonate turbidites of the Ionian fold and thrust belt, {{close to the}} oil-producing centre of Fier-Ballsh (central Albania). The first major diagenetic event controlling reservoir quality was early cementation by isopachous and syntaxial low-Mg calcite. These cements formed primarily around crinoid and rudist fragments, which acted as nucleation sites. In sediments in which these bioclasts are the major rock constituent, this cement can make up 30 % of the rock volume, resulting in low effective porosity. In strata in which these bioclasts are mixed with reworkedmicrite, isopachous/syntaxial cements stabilized the framework, and matrixporosity is around 15 %. The volumetric importance of these cements, their optical and luminescence character (distribution and dull orange luminescence) and stable isotopic signal (delta(18) O and delta(13) C averaging respectively; - 0. 5 parts per thousand VPDB and + 2 parts per thousand VPDB) all support a marine phreatic origin. Within these turbidites and debris flows, several generations of fractures alternated with episodes of cementation. A detailed reconstruction of this history was based on cross-cutting relationships of fractures and compactional and layer-parallel shortening (LPS) stylolites. The <b>prefolding</b> calcite veins possess orange cathodoluminescence {{similar to that of}} the host rock. Their stable isotope signatures (delta(18) O of - 3. 86 to - 0. 85 parts per thousand VPDB and delta(13) C of - 0. 14 to + 2. 98 parts per thousand VPDB) support a closed diagenetic rock-buffered system. A similar closed system accounts for the selectively reopened and subsequently calcite-cemented LPS stylolites (delta(18) O of - 1. 81 to - 1. 14 parts per thousand VPDB and delta(13) C of + 1. 52 to + 2. 56 parts per thousand VPDB). Within the <b>prefolding</b> veins, brecciated host rock fragments and complex textures such as crack and seal features resulted from hydraulic fracturing. They reflect expulsion of overpressured fluids within the footwall of the frontal thrusts. After folding and thrust sheet emplacement, some calcite veins are still rock buffered (delta(18) O of - 0. 96 to + 0. 2 parts per thousand VPDB and delta(13) C of + 0. 79 to + 1. 37 parts per thousand VPDB), whereas others reflect external (i. e. extraformational) and thus large-scale fluid fluxes. Some of these veins are linked to basement-derived fluid circulation or originated from fluid flow along evaporitic decollement horizons (delta(18) O around + 3. 0 parts per thousand VPDB and delta(13) C around + 1. 5 parts per thousand VPDB). Others are related to the maturation of hydrocarbons in the system (delta(18) O around - 7. 1 parts per thousand VPDB and delta(13) C around + 9. 3 parts per thousand VPDB). An open joint system reflecting an extensional stress regime developed during or after the final folding stage. This joint system enhanced vertical connectivity. This open joint network can be explained by the high palaeotopographical position and the folding of the reservoir analogue within the deformational front. The joint system is pre-Burdigalian in age based upon a dated karstified discordance contact. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Palaeomagnetic {{investigation}} of the Upper Carboniferous clastic Hyrnefjellet Formation from opposite limbs of the Hyrnefjellet Anticline in southern Spitsbergen (Sval− bard Archipelago) uncovered two components of NRM. Direction C 1 (D = 224. 6 °; I = – 27. 9 °; = 22. 40; 95 % = 5. 6 °) is of <b>prefolding</b> origin and most probably of near−primary origin. High Tb spectra above 575 °C indicate hematite as the carrier of C 1. Acquisition of the C 1 component {{may be related to}} an early diagenetic crystallization of hematite, not excluding a detrital origin of the NRM. A paleopole calculated for the C 1 component (= 23. 3 °N; = 147. 7 °E) falls into the Late Devonian–Early Carboniferous sector of APWP for Baltica. This result suggests that Svalbard remained in the present day orientation with respect to Baltica since the Carboniferous time. A second component with intermediate unblocking temperatures, determined in the Hyrnefjellet Formation deposits, is labelled C 2. Its mean ori− entation for in situ position is D = 11. 2 °; I = 69. 2 ° (= 44. 05; 95 % = 6. 3 °), thus being similar to Late Mesozoic directions for Baltica. After 100 % tectonic correction for tilting of anticline limbs and axis, the C 2 component orientation is D = 265. 7 °; I = 59. 7 °, thus being distant from any directions for Baltica. Detailed analysis suggest that the C 2 component is most probably of synfolding origin, and it was formed during the Tertiary Alpine Tectonic Event...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Renewed paleomagnetic nvestigations of red beds of the Upper Silurian Bloomsburg and the Lower Carboniferous Mauch Chunk Formations were {{undertaken}} {{with the}} objective of obtaining evidence regarding the possibility of oroclinal bending as contributing to the arcuate structural trend of the Pennsylvania salient. These formations crop out on both limbs of the salient and earlier, but less definitive paleomagnetic studies on these units indicate that early acquired magnetizations can be recovered. Oriented samples were obtained from nine sites on the southern limb of the salient and eight sites from the northern limb in the Bloomsburg. The natural remanent magnetizations are multivectorial, dominated by a component (B) with a distributed spectrum of unblocking temperatures ranging up to 670 øC, and a component (C) with a higher and very discrete distribution of unblocking temperatures. The B component is uniformly of reverse polarity, shows a statistically significant synfolding character, and represents a Late Paleozoic remagnetization. The C component passes fold tests with normal and reverse polarity site means. The C component directions from the southern limb (345. 1 '>/- 31. 6 ø) and the northern limb (359. 3 o/- 29. 7 ø) are significantly different in declination (14. 2 ø+_ 10. 4 ø) but not in inclination (1. 9 ø+ 9 ø). Samples were also analyzed from seven additional sites in the Mauch Chunk on the southem limb of the salient. Inclusion of these new data gives a revised estimate of the difference between southern and northem limb mean directions of <b>prefolding</b> magnetizations i the Mauch Chunk of 23. 3 ø+_ 12. 5 in declination and 4. 8 '+_ 11 ø in inclination.

40|$|Late Precambrian and Palaeozoic {{platform}} sediments {{from the}} Central-South Taimyr Peninsula (Arctic Siberia) are all remagnetised. The remagnetisation is <b>prefold</b> and {{is related to}} thermal remagnetisation caused by Taimyr Trap magmatism. The remagnetisation age is estimated to 220 - 230 Ma and, hence, is considerably younger than the ca. 251 Ma age for {{the main body of}} Siberian Trap flood basalts. The folding that affected the Taimyr region platform sediments also included the Taimyr "Traps," hence, relegating Taimyr deformation to post-Mid Triassic time, and most probably, to a Late Triassic age. This shows that whilst thrusting terminated in the Urals during the Permian, crustal shortening continued in Taimyr, Novaya-Zemlya and the South Barents Sea, well into the Mesozoic.

40|$|Conformational energy {{calculations}} {{are used}} to analyze the interactions of structural substructures in subtilisin BPN. These substructures are kept fixed or "rigid" so that the only variables in the calculations are the backbone segments that separate them. The flexible segments are assumed to be free turns. Using this representation of the protein it is possible to predict both a likely order of events along a folding pathway and preferred modes of conformational changes of the native protein. Moreover, when the native structure has been perturbed by moving the substructures apart, it is possible to assess the range of interactions that return the protein, upon energy minimization, to its original conformation. These results suggest an approach to the folding problem based on the piecemeal formation of tertiary structure from smaller <b>prefolded</b> fragments...|$|R
40|$|By {{virtue of}} their {{synthesis}} in the cytoplasm, proteins destined for import into peroxisomes are obliged to traverse the single membrane of this organelle. Because the targeting signal for most peroxisomal matrix proteins is a carboxy-terminal tripeptide sequence (SKL or its variants), these proteins must remain import competent until their translation is complete. We sought to determine whether stably folded proteins were substrates for peroxisomal import. <b>Prefolded</b> proteins stabilized with disulfide bonds and chemical cross-linkers were shown to be substrates for peroxisomal import, as were mature folded and disulfide-bonded IgG molecules containing the peroxisomal targeting signal. In addition, colloidal gold particles conjugated to proteins bearing the peroxisomal targeting signal were translocated into the peroxisomal matrix. These results support the concept that proteins may fold in the mammalian cytosol, before their import into the peroxisome, and that protein unfolding is not a prerequisite for peroxisomal import...|$|R
