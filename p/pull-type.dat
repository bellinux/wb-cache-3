40|$|With {{regard to}} an ancient bank {{landslide}} near a dam, centrifugal model tests on instability mechanism under reservoir impoundment and rapid drawdown are carried out. The slope models are constructed with the consideration of large-size and heterogeneous characters of the prototype. The centrifuge tests are accompanied with real-time control of water levels, and followed by laboratorial test for physical status and strength of model slope soil. The results of centrifugal tests show that the rising water level in the reservoir leads to decreasing slope foot sliding resistance, as well as leads to edge cracks and slump. Also, the results reveal that the rapid drawdown causes slope body to produce outward hydrodynamic pressure, aggravates slope foot sliding and creates <b>pull-typed</b> landslide trends. When the slope foot is reinforced, the deformation is controlled and stability is improved. The soil tests of model slopes, before and after centrifuge tests, indicate that the slope foot sliding {{will lead to the}} redistribution of soil density and moisture, at the same time lead to the strength reduction near slide zone. Moreover, the cohesion of immersed soils will reduce until it vanishes finally...|$|R
40|$|AbstractStability of {{an ancient}} {{landslide}} in a reservoir area is analyzed by using centrifugal model tests, soil laboratory tests and numerical analysis. Special {{attention is paid to}} variation in water level, simulation of large-scale heterogeneous prototype slope, and strength reduction of sliding zone soils after slope sliding. The results of centrifugal model test show that reservoir impounding can reduce sliding resistance at the slope toe, followed by toe collapsing and front cracking of slope. Rapid drawdown can produce hydrodynamic pressure towards reservoir at the front of slope. Deformation is observed in the middle and upper slope, which reduces the slope stability further and forms the <b>pull-typed</b> landslide trend. Reinforcement of slope toe is effective for preventing the progressive failure. The results of laboratory test show that slope toe sliding will lead to the redistribution of soil density and moisture content, which will reduce the shear strength of soil in sliding zone, and the cohesion of immersed soil is reduced gradually and finally vanishes with time. The numerical results show that the strength reduction method used in finite element method (FEM) is very effective in capturing the progressive failure induced by reservoir water level fluctuations, and the evolution of failure surface derived from numerical simulation is very similar to that observed in centrifugal model test...|$|R

50|$|Tractor-drawn {{combines}} (also called <b>pull-type</b> combines) became common after World War II as many farms {{began to}} use tractors. An example was the All-Crop Harvester series. These combines used a shaker to separate the grain from the chaff and straw-walkers (grates with small teeth on an eccentric shaft) to eject the straw while retaining the grain. Early tractor-drawn combines were usually powered by a separate gasoline engine, while later models were PTO-powered. These machines either put the harvested crop into bags that were then loaded onto a wagon or truck, or had a small bin that stored the grain until it was transferred to a truck or wagon with an auger.|$|E
5000|$|Gleaner {{combines}} {{date back}} to 1923, when the Baldwin brothers of Nickerson, Kansas, created a high-quality and reliable self-propelled combine harvester. They {{decided to use the}} [...] "Gleaner" [...] name for their radically redesigned grain harvesting machine based on inspiration from [...] "The Gleaners", a famous 1857 painting by Jean-François Millet. Gleaning is the act of collecting leftover crops from farmers' fields after they have been commercially harvested, or on fields where it is not economically profitable to harvest, and in the , it is the act of frugally recovering resources from low-yield contexts. Thus, with the Gleaner name, the company evoked a positive connotation in potential customers' minds, of a brand of harvester that would leave none of the grain behind. A combine harvester combines the reaping (plus or minus binding), threshing, and winnowing functions all into one machine—hence the [...] "combine" [...] part of its name. To that list, the Baldwin brothers' Gleaner added self-propulsion. Earlier combines, the so-called <b>pull-type</b> or tractor-drawn combines, were towed by tractors.|$|E
5000|$|McKinney Creek Stadium {{was located}} {{immediately}} off California State Route 89, 19 kilometers (12 mi) south of Squaw Valley. It {{was the only}} venue to not {{be located in the}} ski resort itself. The stadium was 250 m long and between 34 and 45 m wide. Bleachers were erected {{on one side of the}} finish line with space for 1,000 spectators and 200 press officers. A 16 by 4 meter (54 by 13 ft) scoreboard was built behind the finish line, which at any given time showed the latest times and the ten best results. Flags for all participating nations at the games were hoisted along the stadium. The main building was the Timing Building, which consisted of a calculations room, a communications room, an office for the race secretary in addition to areas for timing staff and equipment. The upper section was used by the public announcer and featured sixteen radio booths. Two 6 by 15 meter (20 by 48 ft) Quonset huts with a total sixteen rooms were built for competitors for waxing, resting and changing. Lack of water caused the stadium to lack showers. An identically sized Quonset hut was built for administration personnel and course preparation works. A larger 6 by 20 meter (20 by 64 ft) Quonset hut was built for the press, which included typewriters, teletype machines, telephones and a darkroom. The biathlon course had four shooting ranges along the 20 km course. A 200 m range was installed at 6.5 km, a 250 m range at 9.5 km, a 150 m range at 12.5 km and a 100 m range at 15 km. The ranges had 15 <b>pull-type</b> targest with a [...] "sleeve and plunger" [...] system with five recharges. This allowed up to 75 participants in the race. An additional practacing range was built in the Squaw Valley-Deer Park area, in addition to the 250 m range being available for training. Coordination of the shooting station was undertaken by four groups of twenty men from the United States Air Force Rifle School. First aid stations were installed at each range. Track preparation was undertaken every evening before the events. Crews were assigned to sections of tracks, with the responsibility of skiing the courses one and a half hours before start, policing the section and removing markers after the event. Each event was color-coded and all marking and material for each event used the colors for visual identification. Training tracks were available in the McKinney Park area and the Squaw Valley-Deer Park area. Both official electronic and unofficial manual timing was used. Interval times were taken at 5 km intervals and phoned to the stadium.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Percutaneous {{endoscopic}} gastrostomy (PEG) allows long-term tube feeding. Safety of <b>pull-type</b> and introducer PEG {{placement in}} oncology patients with head/neck or oesophageal malignancies is unknown. Methods Retrospective analysis of 299 patients undergoing PEG tube placement between January 2006 and December 2008 revealed 57 oncology patients. All patients with head/neck or oesophageal malignancy {{were treated with}} chemo- and radiotherapy. In case of high-grade stenosis introducer Freka ® Pexact PEG tube was placed (n = 24) and in all other patients (n = 33) conventional <b>pull-type</b> PEG tube. Short-term complications and mortality rates were compared. Results Patients' characteristics and clinical status were comparable in both groups. Short-term complications were encountered in 11 / 24 (48 %) introducer PEG patients as compared to only 4 / 33 (12 %) <b>pull-type</b> PEG patients (P vs. 0 / 33 (0 %, P vs. 3 / 33 (9 %, NS). Finally, 3 / 24 gastrointestinal perforations (12 %) resulted from a difficult placement procedure vs. 1 / 33 (3 %), leading to urgent surgical intervention and admission to ICU. Two introducer PEG patients died at ICU, resulting in an overall mortality rate of 8 % vs. 0 % (P = 0. 091). Conclusion The introducer Freka ® Pexact PEG procedure for long-term tube feeding may lead to significantly higher complication and mortality rates in patients with head/neck or oesophageal malignancies treated with chemo- and radiotherapy. It is suggested to use the conventional <b>pull-type</b> PEG tube placement in this group of patients, if possible. </p...|$|E

40|$|Novel {{approaches}} to percutaneous gastrostomy have evolved because of catheter clogging and displacement, which is commonly seen with currently available gastrostomy catheters. Low-profile button gastrostomy catheters, {{designed to be}} inserted into mature tracts, have recently been inserted into fresh gastrostomy tracts. Catheter clogging rarely occurs with these low-profile devices.

40|$|Abstract—A key design goal of erasure-coded storage {{clusters}} is {{to minimize}} reconstruction time, {{which in turn}} leads to high reliability by reducing vulnerability window size. PULL-Rep and PULL-Sur are two existing reconstruction schemes based on <b>PULL-type</b> transmission, where a rebuilding node initiates reconstruction by sending a set of read requests to surviving nodes to retrieve surviving blocks. To eliminate the transmission bottleneck of replacement nodes in PULL-Rep and mitigate the extra overhead caused by non-contiguous disk access in PULL-Sur, we incorporate PUSH-type transmissions to node reconstruction, where the reconstruction procedure is divided into multiple tasks accomplished by surviving nodes in a pipelining manner. We also propose two PUSH-based reconstruction schemes (i. e., PUSH-Rep and PUSH-Sur), which can not only exploit the I/O parallelism of PULL-Sur, but also maintain sequential I/O accesses inherited from PULL-Rep. We build four reconstruction-time models to study the reconstruction process and estimate the reconstruction time of the four schemes in large-scale storage clusters. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype where the four reconstruction schemes are deployed and quantitatively evaluated. Experimental {{results show that the}} PUSH-based reconstruction schemes outperform the PULL-based counterparts. In a real-world (9, 6) RS-coded storage cluster, PUSH-Rep speeds up the reconstruction time by a factor of 5. 76 compared with PULL-Rep; PUSH-Sur accelerates the reconstruction by a factor of 1. 85 relative to PULL-Sur.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the challenges of}} improving the on-time delivery performance of a high-volume critical part type in a high-product-mix manufacturing facility of valves. Preliminary analysis on the push-type production system of the valve manufacturing cell shows that long production lead time caused by excessive inventory queuing and accumulation as well as lack of standardized finished goods inventory management policy are the major factors that limit the on-time delivery performance. A new <b>pull-type</b> production system is developed with {{the design of a}} highly responsive fabrication line which enables faster material movement and an efficient inventory review framework for real-time monitoring of inventory positions. A dedicated production line with the placement of effectively controlled Work-In-Process (WIP) buffers is constructed, which is capable of reducing the production lead time by more than 80 %, along with a 40 % reduction in overall WIP volume. Moreover, a finished goods inventory review policy is proposed based on the (s, S) policy which significantly eliminates the possibilities of backlog and inventory explosion by the setup of both lower and upper control limits on inventory positions. The suggested policy is expected to ensure a service level of at least 95 % during peak demand period, with up to 50 % potential reduction in average inventory level held by the system. A Kanban system is also established to coordinate operations in the proposed <b>pull-type</b> production system. by Bingxin Yao. Thesis: M.
