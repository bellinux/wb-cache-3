40|$|BACKGROUND: Prevalence of {{psychiatric}} disorders in homeless population {{is high and}} it can {{increase the risk of}} criminal behavior. In Hungary no systematic study was performed in this field until this time. This study aimed to survey the prevalence rate {{of psychiatric}} disorders among people living in homeless shelters and explore its correlations with demographic variables. Investigating the correlation between psychiatric disorders and criminal behavior was also among the aims of the study. METHODS: Data concerning medical and forensic history was collected in a structured interview and then SCID-I and SCID-II diagnostic interview was performed in voluntary persons living in 3 homeless shelters. RESULTS: Eighty-six percent of the sample had a diagnosable psychiatric disorder. Personality disorder and alcohol dependence were the most common diagnoses in males, while personality disorder and anxiety disorders were the most common diagnoses in females. Comorbid conditions were present in 72 % of the cases. Only 37 % of those who had a DSM diagnosis were currently in psychiatric care. The lowest rate was found in patients with major depression (31 %). Only drug and <b>psychopharmacon</b> dependence showed significant correlation (p= 0. 023 and p= 0. 024) with violent and non-violent offending out of the diagnostic subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of severe mental disorders among homeless persons is high in Hungary too. Low rate of homeless persons being in psychiatric care indicates that traditional structure of care is not suitable for them, they need a tailored complex approach. This survey confirmed that criminal behavior is not more frequent among those homeless persons who have psychiatric disorders neither in terms of violent nor in non-violent acts except those having drug or <b>psychopharmacon</b> dependence...|$|E
