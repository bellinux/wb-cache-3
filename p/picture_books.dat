Players explore a 3D environment to find <b>picture</b> <b>books.</b> Upon finding them the player is transported into pop-up <b>picture</b> <b>books</b> to complete minigames and open {{the path to the}} next part of the story. The <b>picture</b> <b>books</b> take the form of Aesop's Fables and Grimm's Fairy Tales with the player character often taking the main role. Other Final Fantasy characters take up roles within the stories. More simplistic minigames, known as microgames, are also scattered throughout the world. Unlike minigames, these are not located within pop-up books, do not affect the game-world and are not required to progress in the game.|$|E

40|$|The <b>picture</b> <b>book</b> is {{an artistic}} medium {{is part of}} literature, {{especially}} of children’s literature. This discussion of the <b>picture</b> <b>book</b> extends to the dynamic between author and illustrator, and interactions between the verbal and the visual, as described by contemporary researchers, such as Maria Nikolajeva, Lawrence R. Sipe, and Carole Scott. Most of them were not <b>picture</b> <b>book</b> creators, so {{the voice of the}} <b>picture</b> <b>book’s</b> creator is easily overlooked. To fill the gap between the researcher and the creator, this project explores the creative process of the <b>picture</b> <b>book</b> by studio-art research. This project is concerned with the creation process of a <b>picture</b> <b>book,</b> presenting a coherent overview of an approach to creating an artist’s <b>picture</b> <b>book,</b> especially in the idea of development through both visual and narrative by two methods: research and practice. This thesis demonstrates my framework of creating an artistic <b>picture</b> <b>book,</b> Little Mouse. Chapter one discusses the methodology of the studio-art research, compares practical-led research and practical-based research, and identifies my multicultural background, to set the foundation of this project. In Chapter two, I applied a part of practical-led methodology to adapt and transfer a range of sources from history, theory, literature and popular culture to build up and enhance the depth of my concept of Little Mouse, which encompasses and analyses my core interest - a life-changing journey. Chapter three discusses how I applied practical-based methodology to reflect the progress of the practical work of making Little Mouse, particularly focusing on how framed a fiction story, and discussing step by step my approach to illustration practice. In the last chapter, I tested my potential readers to review whether my work succeeded in communicating and delivering my visual research in the form of my finished book. This project hybridizes multicultural sources to form a contemporary <b>picture</b> <b>book</b> which blurs the boundaries between illustrator/writer and reality/fiction. This also provides a case study of the <b>picture</b> <b>book</b> for bridging research and <b>picture</b> <b>book’s</b> creator and demonstrates a process of understanding and interpreting creative activities...|$|R
