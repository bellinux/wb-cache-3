40|$|Mt. St. Hilaire {{occurs as}} a small funnel-shaped {{intrusion}} in the Monteregian <b>petrographic</b> <b>province</b> of Quebec and consists of alkali gabbros and later nepheline syenites. Based on field relations, petrography, and geochemistry, five types of gabbro are recognized. In order of intrusion these are: leucogabbro, foliated gabbro, kaersutite-biotite gabbro, kaersutite gabbro, and a gabbro-melagabbro series. Based on analyses of the early-forming ilmenite-titanomagnetite, the gabbros crystallized under high fO 2 conditions which lead to subsequent crystallization of olivines with high MnO contents. Fractionation of ilmenite and titanomagnetite was a major control on the Ti and A[TV]concentrations in the clinopyroxenes. Plagioclase compositions in the gabbros became richer in Ab contents in the sequence gabbro-melagabbro to leucogabbro. Whole-rock analyses suggest that the parental magma of alkali basaltic composition was fairly evolved prior to emplacement. Lack of olivine in the cumulate gabbro-melagabbros and low Ni and Cr in all gabbros may reflect either extreme olivine fractionation and/or a very low olivine content in the source material for these basalts. Differentiation of the gabbros occurred both pre- and post-emplacement, probably by a process of crystal-liquid fractionation at depths between 3 - 5 and 8 km. This is in accordance with geophysical measurements for other Monteregian intrusions. A model is presented for the mechanism of emplacement...|$|E
40|$|Permanent address The Kenya Rift {{is part of}} the East African Rift system, {{which is}} an active {{continental}} divergent zone. The Southern segment of the Kenya Rift Valley is a unique <b>petrographic</b> <b>province</b> comprising of at least four Quaternary to Recent volcanic complexes namely Suswa, Longonot, Olkaria, and Eburru. Although these volcanoes are located only about 40 km from each other, the eruptive products show marked compositional contrasts, requiring differences in magmatic processes. The rocks are characterised by subalkaline/peralkaline trachyte and/or peralkaline rhyolite volcanism with basalts being confined to eruption sites between individual centres. The segment of the Kenya Rift has anomalously high heat flow due to shallow intrusions. Active geothermal systems are associated with the volcanic centres. This paper summarizes the geology of the southern segment of the Kenya Rift and discusses reasons that indicate greater geothermal potential for Olkaria and Eburru and promising geothermal potential for Suswa and Longonot volcanic centres all with an estimated potential of more than 1000 MWe. These include the youthfulness of the volcanic activities, large shallow magma chambers, fractured reservoir rocks, and favourable hydrogeology.

Samples for the analysis were collected from two levels of the cores, i. e. late Holocene S-group samples in the upper part and last glacial to early Holocene D-group samples in {{the lower part of}} the cores. Both the S-group and D-group samples are comprised of the same kinds of heavy minerals and show the nearly completely same distribution patterns of the frequency of those minerals. These patterns suggest the existence of at least two <b>petrographic</b> <b>provinces,</b> i. e. western and central-eastern areas, which must reflect the difference of the provenances of East Antarctica and West Antarctica. Especially, olivine and clinopyroxene with titanaugite, dominantly distributed in the western area, were probably supplied from the late Quaternary McMurdo alkaline basaltic volcanics fringing the eastern margin of the Victoria Land. The strong similarity of the distribution pattern of heavy mineral composition between the S-group and D-group samples suggests the long-term stability of flow patterns of icebergs in the Ross Sea. Such stability must be controlled by the submarine topography in the Ross Sea, which plays the most important role in the Ross Sea, controlling not only the types of sediments, but also the flow patterns of icebergs...|$|R

Six <b>petrographic</b> <b>provinces</b> were differentiated on the basis of physical and mineralogical properties. It was found that sands south and west of the Golden Gate in less than 60 to 100 feet of water reflect the mineralogy of San Francisco Bay sedim~nts, a"d samples from the mollusk-rich Bolinas Bay and adjacent areas to the north and west contained large amounts of aragonite. Sediments in 60 to 100 feet of water west of the Golden Gate are unusually high in hornblende and sediments in more than 100 feet of water are somewhat higher in minerals of the Franciscan Formation than 3 ed~ments closer to the coast. It is concluded from this information that the San Francisco Bay Ear and adjacent sediments south and west of the Golden ~ate have been derived principally from San Fran~isco Bay, gnd that sediments in the Bolinas fay area are derived in large part from the decomposition of shells of modern marine organisms. The areas in 60 to 100 feet of water and greater than 100 feet of water do not appear to have any modern sources of sediment and are interpreted as relicts of features developed during lower stands of sea level. Similarities between sediments in more than 100 feet of water in this area and sediments in the same environment {{to the north of the}} area studied suggest a less complicated distribution of sediments and perhaps extensive longshore transport of sediments during this lower stand of sea level.

Zoning of various types is a conspicuous feature in these pyroxenes. Optical and chemical data are presented and a comparison is made between these pyroxenes and similar ones from alkali basalts. It is known from published ata that A 12 Oa fluctuates strongly in the oscillatory zones of Vesuvian pyroxenes. This can be explained as due to temperature variation in the magma, to magma variation in silica content due to contamination, to oscillations in leucite precipitation, or to a combination ofthese factors.

40|$|The {{object of}} this {{investigation}} was to categorize all geological and geochemical parameters applicable to the Loch Loyal syenites and to relate these both to processes operating there and to the broader problems of alkaline rock genesis. Whole rock and trace element contents have been determined for the Loyal syenites and compared with other alkaline intrusions in Scotland and both pegmatite chemistry and mineralogy have been detailed. Loch Loyal syenites consist of three separate bodies, Ben Loyal, Beinn Stumanadh, and Cnoc nan Cuilean each intrusive into grey flaggy psammitic Moinian granulites. They are best described as quartz-nordmarkites. Emplacement of the magma resulted in the formation of a feldspar flow lamination in the outer parts of the Loyal mass and to deformation of the surrounding country rocks. Core rocks crystallized as a one-feldspar type and outer laminated syenites as a two-feldspar assemblage. A pegmatitic phase was succeeded by low-temperature hydrothermal mineralisation and considerable deuteric activity in which strontium and barium carbonates, hematite and rare-earth elements were deposited either in veins or druses and, at a temperature close to 25000, a type of lead metasomatism formed green amazonitic feldspar. The intermediate nature of the Loyal nordmarkite has been established, it straddles the sodaclase-granite/nordmarkite division of Johannsen, is close to sphene-orthite type granitoids but contains a mineral with monazite structure, and the tantalo-niobate mineral polycrase occurs within the pegmatites contrary to a suggestion byPavlenko et. ale that such minoralo arc absent from sphene-orthite typo granitoids. Tho other alkaline intrusions in Sutherland, Loch Ailsh and Loch Borralan, were found to differ in trace-element chemistry from each other and from the Loch Loyal syenites. Even so a general alkaline <b>petrographic</b> <b>province</b> is postulated for the N. W. Highlands which persisted from early Caledonian times and included the metamorphosed syenite of Glen Dessarry, part of the Glenelg-Ratagain complex and scattered areas of soda-metasomatism. Compared with other rocks of the Scottish "Newer Igneous" suite Loyal syenites are markedly enriched in Pb,Ba,Nb, and the rare-earth elements and very greatly dbficient in calcium. Anomalous radioactivity associated with the Loyal intrusions is due chiefly to the thorium content of allanite. Within the pegmatites of Sgor Chaonasaid at the northern extremity of the Loyal range a zonation between galena and silicate minerals exists in which silver and copper form complex sulphides such as stromoyerite. The origin of the Loyal syenites is not thought to be connected with tho hypothesis of limestone assimilation for alkaline rock genesis as envisaged by Daly and Shand nor to tho specialised stable tectonic conditions considered important by Harker, but to anatexis at depth and subsequent extreme differentiation, connected with faulting, which resulted in an increased sodium content and a 'reworking' of surrounding sediments and/or granitic rocks, with consequent enhancement of U,Th,Nb,RE's,Ba and Sr over that usual for granitic rocks...|$|E

40|$|The studies concern ing {{longshore}} drift {{carried out on}} Pisa coast {{go back to the}} end of Seventies and are antecedent to the construction of most part of the coastal defence systems. The subsequent construction of protection structures has probably modified coastal dynamics. Therefore, through an agreement between Provincia an d University of Pisa a multidisciplinary study has been pianned in order to define and widen the knowledge about the Pisa coasta zone. O ne of these regards the study of provenance of littoral sands by compositional analysis. The Pisa coastal area, about 26 km long, belongs to the physiographic unit comprised between Punta Bianca and Livornesi Mounts and is mainly made by sand beaches fed from north to south by Magra, Serchio, Arno and Scolmatore rivers. The last three and particu larly the Arno River feed the pisa n coast even if in an insufficient way. Beginning from {{the second half of the}} nineteenth century the Arno delta underwent rapid erosion because of severa l factors, which strongly changed sedimentary budgets. The petrography of recent sands from the Pisa coast is used to determine their provenance and thus how their longshore transport and distribution occur. In respect to previous works the step of sampling has been increased a long transects norma l to the shore up to the 10 m isobath in order to a better estimati o n of longshore behaviour. The modal analysis has allowed us to recognize two <b>petrographic</b> <b>provinces,</b> from north to the south, which reflect distinct provenances. The northern province includes lithoquartzose sands, fed largely by the Arno River and, in small quantities, by the Serchio River. The southern province consists of quartzolithic sands, less quartzose than sands belonging to the former province. The moda l analysis and the petrographical characterization of the latter indicate a northward sediment drift.

40|$|The Tajo River, the 10 th largest {{river in}} Europe, drains {{part of the}} western passive margin of Europe that {{includes}} multiple tectonic elements of the Iberian plate. Modern fluvial sand composition in the Tajo River drainage basin reflects {{the nature of the}} source region, which lies in {{the central part of the}} Iberian Peninsula. Four fluvial <b>petrographic</b> <b>provinces</b> (A, B, C and D) can be established in the Tajo drainage basin, corresponding well with the four principal structural units drained: (1) the Iberian Range; (2) the Hesperian massif; (3) The Tertiary Tajo basin; and (4) the Neogene Santarem–Lisboa basin. Province A corresponds to the Tajo River head and is characterized by quartzolithic sedimenticlastic sands (Qm 67 F 4 Lt 29 and Rs 79 Rg 3 Rm 18). These sands have been derived from diverse Mesozoic siliciclastics and carbonates of the Iberian Range. Province B appears in the upper reaches of the Tajo River course and is quartzofeldspathic (Qm 57 F 34 Lt 9) with diverse rock fragments (Rs 34 Rg 23 Rm 43). Sources are Hercynian granitoids and metasediments and Neogene clastics and minor carbonates of the Tertiary Tajo basin. Province C extends along the middle course of the Tajo River with quartzofeldspathic metamorphiclastic sand modes (Qm 60 F 33 Lt 7; Rs 4 Rg 21 Rm 75). The sources are metamorphic rocks intruded by plutonites of the Hesperian Massif. Province D is quartzofeldspathic (Qm 55 F 39 Lt 6) with a dominance of phaneritic rock fragments (Rs 5 Rg 33 Rm 62) and corresponds to the lower reaches of the Tajo River, where siliciclastic deposits of the Neogene Santarem–Lisboa basin are the main sources. Sands plot on provenance-discrimination diagram (QmFLt) within the recycled-orogen field (Tajo River head) and continentalblock fields (upper, middle and lower course). In addition, we have proven the usefulness of the RsRgRm diagram to discriminate the defined fluvial provinces, originating from heterogeneous parent-rock textures and mineralogy. Climate does not exert any strong influence on the petrogenesis of the Tajo River drainage basin sand, and erosion in the source areas may be described in terms of weathering-limited denudation regime. By contrast, mixing with tributary supplies is the main process that modifies composition in the Tajo River sand. The establishment of fluvial provinces related to the main bedrock structural units reflects the great relevance of tributaries from each province in the generation of the Tajo River sand and the low significance of inherited sandy load from previous provinces.

It is one of the important polymetallic sulphide deposits occurring within the submarine volcanic environment of the Eastern Pontus ore <b>province.</b> <b>Petrographic</b> and chemical studies of the country rocks, despite their heavy alteration, show that they have similar features to the calcalkali rock series of orogenic belts. The investigated area exhibits submarine volcanic rocks and sediment intercalations. Volcanicity took place between Upper Jurassic - Lower Cretaceous and Oligocene - Miocene and is represented by three distinct cycles. The first cycle shows an almost total fractionation sequence, however the last two contain only basic rocks. The ore mineralisation of the area like most occurrences within the Eastern Pontus ore province, is associated with the so-called "ore-bearing dacite". The Harkkoy polymetallic and the Israil pyritic sulphide deposits have been studied for the purpose of comparison of their ore minerals with those of the Harsit-Koprubasi deposit. An electron probe microanalyser was used to determine the composition of the rock forming, and ore minerals, and also to compare various representatives of continuous isomorphous series of some sulphosalts. The majority of the analyses were of sphalerites; the Fe, Mn and Cd contents being found useful for purposes of comparison. Homogenisation and last-ice-melting temperatures of the fluid inclusions in sphalerite, quartz and barite crystals from the Harsit-Koprubasi deposit range between 239 ° to 338 oC, and - 1. 0 to - 3. 1 °C, respectively.

40|$|SUMMARY: Silcrete of Cenozoic age {{associated}} with deep weathering profiles occurs on residual surfaces along the coastal belt of southern Cape <b>Province.</b> <b>Petrographic</b> and geochemical evidence indicates loss of aluminium and enrichment of silica and titanium during silcrete formation. Silica released locally within the weathering profile was appar-ently precipitated in {{a zone of}} restricted drainage close to the water-table where a low pH environment allowed theremoval of aluminium and the migration and concentration of titanium. Silcrete formation probably occurred in a humid tropical or subtropical envi-ronment with minimal local relief. The numerous reports of silcrete now available in the literature indicate {{the wide range of}} sedimentological and environmental settings with which it is associated (Langford-Smith 1978; Summerfield 1983). Work in southern Africa and north-west Europe has indicated that silcretes {{associated with}} kaolinitic weathering profiles possess a typical suite of petrographic and geochemical characteristics, including authigenic glaebules (Brewer 1964, pp. 259 - 60), colloform features and relatively high concentrations of TiO a (> 0. 2 %), which are not present in non-weathering profile occurrences (Summerfield 1978, 1979, 1982). In southern Africa, non-weathering profile silcretes, including silicified sands, pan sedi-ments, calcrete and bedrock, occur predomin-antly in the Kalahari Basin in Botswana, north-ern Cape Province and eastern Namibia (Sum-merfield, 1982). This paper describes the weathering profile silcretes of southern Africa, which are confined to a relatively narrow coastal belt (Cape coastal zone) extending from the Oliphants River valley in the west to the Transkei n the east (Fig. 1). A limited number of non-weathering profile silcretes also occur within this area but these are considered else-where (Summerfield 1981). There {{have been a number of}} previous studies of silcrete in the Cape coastal zone, but none of these have pro-vided detailed geochemical data on associated weathering profile materials (Bosazza 1936...|$|R
