40|$|Abstract. In the {{projection}} system, the projected image {{should be able}} to meet the normal visual needs of observer, so that the viewer can get the correct projection. When the <b>projection</b> <b>screen</b> surface is the irregular free surface, {{the projection}} geometric correction of the projected image becomes the research focus. For the question of irregular <b>projection</b> <b>screen</b> surface, this paper presents effective geometric correction method. The geometric correction method based on the geometry of irregular <b>projection</b> <b>screen</b> surface and ideal location of viewport to calculate the points’ three-dimensional coordinate values. In this paper, the projection geometric correction method is widely applicable to various <b>projection</b> <b>screen</b> surface environments...|$|R

5|$|Although {{enjoyment}} {{factored into}} Culverhouse's {{purchase of the}} Buccaneers, it was {{first and foremost a}} business decision which he expected to be profitable. He admitted to being known for his frugality, due to moves such as wearing outdated clothing, and having the One Buc Place walls painted white to avoid having to spend money on <b>projection</b> <b>screens.</b> This was not initially a problem for the franchise, even though the budget airplane that Culverhouse chartered for the team almost crashed after their very first game; original coach John McKay reported in 1978 that Culverhouse had never blocked any deals, even those involving a great amount of money. Later, however, the team let go or traded away many of its players who were highly paid and/or demanded more money, including Dave Pear, Doug Williams, Ricky Reynolds, Reggie Cobb, Mark Carrier, and Jeris White. First-round draft choices were frequently traded for players who were not considered to be of equal value, as when the team traded for often-injured defensive end Wally Chambers without requiring that he first pass a physical examination. Frustration over being beaten by players he had pleaded with Culverhouse to sign contributed to the resignation of McKay. He also fired well-regarded personnel director Ken Herock, when Herock demanded to be paid in line with his value around the league.|$|E

500|$|The {{attraction}} features thirteen [...] <b>projection</b> <b>screens,</b> {{twelve of}} which use 3D projection. The ride uses a polarized 3D system {{where the two}} projectors have polarizers designed to interact with each lens of the 3D glasses. By blocking light from one projector with each lens, the 3D effect is achieved. With traditional 3D projections there is an ideal seating location, where an off-center viewing location reduces the overall effect of the 3D. To allow the ride to effectively combine 3D projections with moving viewers, [...] Kleiser-Walczak and their head of software, Frank Vtiz, developed a process they called squinching. First, the amount of distortion is predicted from a particular viewing angle. This same amount of distortion is then added {{in the opposite direction}} in order to counteract the effects. Initially miniature models were used to determine the ride's path and the vehicle's point of view, with full-scale prototypes being used later. Trowbridge and Coup are credited with inventing the concept of squinching, with Universal Studios holding a patent for the method.|$|E

500|$|A {{separate}} model, approximately [...] long, {{was created}} for the Nostromo underside from which the Narcissus would detach and from which Kane's body would be launched during the funeral scene. Bower carved Kane's burial shroud out of wood; it was launched through the hatch using a small catapult and filmed at high speed. The footage was slowed down in editing. Only one shot was filmed using blue-screen compositing: that of the shuttle racing past the Nostromo. The other shots were simply filmed against black backdrops, with stars added via double exposure. Though motion control photography technology was available at the time, the film's budget would not allow for it. The team therefore used a camera with wide-angle lenses mounted on a drive mechanism to make slow passes over and around the models filming at 2½ frames per second, giving them the appearance of motion. Scott added smoke and wind effects to enhance the illusion. For the scene in which the Nostromo detaches from the refinery, a [...] docking arm was created using pieces from model railway kits. The Nostromo was {{pushed away from the}} refinery by a forklift covered in black velvet, causing the arm to extend out from the refinery. This created the illusion that the arm was pushing the ship forward. Shots of the ship's exterior in which characters are seen moving around inside were filmed using larger models which contained <b>projection</b> <b>screens</b> displaying pre-recorded footage.|$|E
500|$|To {{redesign}} the {{set for the}} 1992 North American stadium leg—dubbed [...] "Outside Broadcast"—Williams {{collaborated with}} stage designers Mark Fisher and Jonathan Park, both of whom had worked on the Rolling Stones' Steel Wheels Tour stage set. The set was expanded to include a [...] stage, and the Vidiwalls were supplemented by four larger mega-video screens. Williams faced difficulties in designing the outdoor lighting system, as the stage {{did not have a}} roof. He settled on using the venues' house spotlights and strategically placed lights in the structure behind the band. The spires of the stage, intended to resemble transmission towers, were tall enough that the Federal Aviation Administration required them to have blinking warning lights. The stage's appearance was compared to the techno-future cityscapes from Blade Runner and the works of cyberpunk writer William Gibson. The B-stage was located {{at the end of a}} [...] catwalk. This larger set used 176speaker enclosures, 312 subwoofers, 592 [...] mid-range speakers, 18projectors, 26on-stage microphones, twoBetacam and twoVideo-8 handheld video cameras, and 11Trabants suspended by cranes over the stage. The outdoor stage used for the 1993 legs of the tour was smaller due to budget concerns, and it discarded the Trabants hung from cranes, instead featuring threecars hanging behind the drum kit. All of the <b>projection</b> <b>screens</b> were replaced with [...] "video cubes", as the projectors were not bright enough for the European summer nights, when daylight remained later into the evening.
