25|$|Because the MU-2 offers {{very high}} {{performance}} {{at a relatively}} low cost, some of its operators lack sufficient training and experience for such an advanced aircraft. The MU-2 has performance similar to a small jet, yet early pilot certification required only a simple endorsement from pilot certificates for much slower twin <b>piston-engine</b> <b>aircraft.</b> The fact that numerous MU-2 pilots were inexperienced at high speeds and high altitudes seems to {{have resulted in the}} high crash rate. Once a type certification was required for an MU-2 pilot certificate, the accident rate dropped to normal levels.|$|E
25|$|Besides the {{aircraft}} in the Gianni Caproni Museum of Aeronautics collection (some of which have survived with no damage or have been restored while others have only survived as components), the museum houses and displays many other artifacts of historical importance: engines, propellers, instruments and components of aircraft, airships and other flying machines as well as documents, medals, models, photographs and personal memorabilia. Among the most noteworthy, however, the following can be cited: the Piaggio P.XIbis R.C.40D engine that equipped the Caproni Ca.161bis which, in 1938, established an altitude world record for <b>piston-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> which stands to the present day; a fragment of the Blériot XI that Jorge Chávez successfully completed the first air crossing of the Alps in 1910; the wing rib of a Wright brothers biplane; Guglielmo Marconi's radio which he used for the first communication by air balloons and airships, and the fuel tank of a Supermarine Spitfire which crashed in Italy during World War II.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, Raytheon {{acquired}} Beech Aircraft Corporation, {{a leading}} manufacturer of general aviation aircraft founded in 1932 by Walter H. Beech. In 1993 the company expanded its aircraft activities {{by adding the}} Hawker line of business jets by acquiring Corporate Jets Inc., the business jet product line of British Aerospace (now BAE Systems). These two entities were merged in 1994 to become the Raytheon Aircraft Company. In {{the first quarter of}} 2007 Raytheon sold its aircraft operations, which subsequently operated as Hawker Beechcraft, and since 2014 have been units of Textron Aviation. The product line of Raytheon's aircraft subsidiary included business jets such as the Hawker 800XP and Hawker 4000, the Beechjet 400A, and the Premier I; the popular King Air series of twin turboprops; and <b>piston-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> such as the Bonanza. Its special-mission aircraft included the single-turboprop T-6A Texan II, which the United States Air Force and United States Navy had chosen as their primary training aircraft.|$|E

500|$|With an {{expanded}} infrastructure in place, GA became established {{after the war}} when manufacturers such as Cessna and Piper introduced light aircraft designed for the private market. The Cessna 172, developed from the late 1940s Cessna 170, was introduced in 1956, and became the world's best selling single-engine aeroplane. Single <b>piston-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> are still the most common class of aircraft in the UK GA fleet. The development of the Rogallo wing in the 1950s fostered the development of hang-gliding during the 1960s and 1970s. The 1960s also saw experiments with motorised hang gliders, {{but it was not}} until the 1970s that this blend of technologies started to mature, resulting in the birth of the microlight movement. Another milestone in the development of GA was the 1964 introduction of the Learjet 23. Although it was not the first business jet, it popularised corporate aviation, and established the personal jet as a [...] "whole new class of aircraft".|$|E
2500|$|During development, skeptical {{elements}} of the Air Ministry had expected mature piston-powered aircraft types to exceed {{the capabilities of the}} Meteor in all respects except that of speed; thus, the performance of early Meteors was considered favourable for the interceptor mission, being capable of out-diving the majority of enemy aircraft. The conclusion of in-service trials conducted between the Meteor F.3. and the Hawker Tempest V was that the performance of the Meteor exceeded the Tempest in almost all respects and that, barring some manoeuvrability issues, the Meteor could be considered a capable all-round fighter. Pilots formerly flying <b>piston-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> often described the Meteor as being exciting to fly. Ex-RAF pilot Norman Tebbit stated of his experience of the Meteor: [...] "Get airborne, up with the wheels, hold it low until you were about 380 knots, pull it up and she would go up, well we thought then, like a rocket".|$|E
50|$|Hartzell {{introduced}} Top-Prop, replacement propellers for <b>piston-engine</b> <b>aircraft,</b> in 1991 {{and sold}} 20,000 Top-Prop conversion kits between 1991 and 2013.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "loadmaster" [...] is {{believed}} to have been created by the Douglas Aircraft Company, because the first known use of the term appears in the flight manuals for the C-124 Globemaster II aircraft in the late 1940s, the largest <b>piston-engine</b> transport <b>aircraft</b> in the US inventory at the time.|$|R
50|$|Fuel for <b>piston-engine</b> powered <b>aircraft</b> (usually a high-octane {{gasoline}} {{known as}} avgas) {{has a low}} flash point to improve its ignition characteristics. Turbine engines can operate {{with a wide range}} of fuels, and jet-aircraft engines typically use fuels with higher flash points, which are less flammable and therefore safer to transport and handle.|$|R
25|$|In 1946, {{the first}} {{production}} aircraft entered service with the RAF, only {{months after the}} conflict {{had come to a}} close. The Vampire was the second jet fighter, after the Gloster Meteor, operated by the RAF and the first to be powered by one jet engine. Aside from its propulsion system and twin-boom configuration, it was a relatively conventional aircraft. The Vampire quickly replaced many wartime <b>piston-engine</b> fighter <b>aircraft</b> and was in front-line service until 1953, after which the Vampire was primarily assigned to secondary roles such as pilot training and ground attack, for which specialist variants of the type were produced.|$|R

5000|$|Overwing fueling is used {{on smaller}} planes, helicopters, and all <b>piston-engine</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Overwing fueling is similar to car fueling [...] - [...] one or more fuel ports are opened and fuel is pumped in with a {{conventional}} pump.|$|E
50|$|Beechcraft (by then renamed Raytheon Aircraft) {{continued}} {{production of}} the two <b>piston-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> models that had survived the pre-GARA shakeout, the Bonanza and Baron, but never resumed production {{of any of the}} types that it had cut during the GARA debate.|$|E
50|$|The BAC Jet Provost is a {{dedicated}} jet-powered trainer aircraft; according to aviation publication Flight International, {{it has the}} distinction of being the first ab initio jet trainer to be standardised by any air force. As designed, it was intended for the Jet Provost to replace, rather than accompany, the use of <b>piston-engine</b> trainer <b>aircraft.</b> Accordingly, with such use, the design of the Jet Provost incorporates numerous features to support students during training. The aerodynamic design deliberately avoids speed, instead focusing on favourable handling characteristics and ease of recovery from stall and spin conditions. An emphasis was placed on flexibility, enabling use of the type throughout a range of training operations.|$|R
5000|$|An {{example of}} a modern {{multi-valve}} <b>piston-engine</b> for small <b>aircraft</b> is the Austro Engine AE300. This liquid-cooled turbocharged 2.0-liter (1,991 cc) DOHC 16-valve straight-4 diesel engine uses common rail direct fuel injection and delivers [...] at 3,880 rpm (62.0 kW/liter). The propeller is driven by an integrated gearbox (ratio 1.69:1) with torsional vibration damper. Total power unit weight is 185 kg.|$|R
5000|$|The Percival P.56 Provost was a British basic trainer {{that was}} {{developed}} for the Royal Air Force in the 1950s {{as a replacement for}} the Percival Prentice. It was a low-wing monoplane with a fixed, tailwheel undercarriage and like the Prentice had a side-by-side seating arrangement. The Provost has the distinction of being the last <b>piston-engine</b> basic trainer <b>aircraft</b> to be operated by the RAF.|$|R

50|$|During 2005, a {{batch of}} thirty SF.260EA were {{delivered}} to the Italian Air Force for a total price of €33 million ($40 million). This model, which had been specially developed to meet an Italian Air Force requirement for an advanced <b>piston-engine</b> <b>aircraft,</b> is used for screening and principal training activities.|$|E
50|$|Although {{successfully}} {{introduced into}} the Italian Air Force service, the P.148 was withdrawn from use {{with the introduction of}} an all-jet training programme. In 1970, the aircraft was re-{{introduced into the}} Italian Air Force Service, when the basic <b>piston-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> regained a role in the selection of pilots. Some aircraft were sold by the Air Force to the Somali Air Corps as trainers.|$|E
25|$|After major {{modifications}} and upgrades, including {{installation of a}} two-stage turbocharger in place of its original single-stage unit, a larger fuel tank and additional intercooling capacity, the ALTUS II returned to flight status {{in the summer of}} 1998. The goal of its development test flights was to reach one of the major Level 2 performance milestones within NASA's ERAST program: to fly a gasoline-fueled, <b>piston-engine</b> remotely piloted <b>aircraft</b> for several hours at an altitude at or near 60,000 feet. On March 5, 1999, The ALTUS II maintained flight at or above 55,000 feet for three hours, reaching a maximum density altitude of 57,300 feet during the mission.|$|R
5000|$|Using the $50,000 {{from the}} sale of his bombsight to the U. S. Government, Seversky founded the Seversky Aero Corporation in 1923. Concentrating on making {{aircraft}} parts and instruments, the small company was unable to survive the stock market crash of 1929. On February 16, 1931, with the backing of Wall Street millionaire Edward Moore and other investors, he resurrected the enterprise as the new Seversky Aircraft Corporation in Long Island, New York. Moving into the former EDO Aircraft Corporation's float plane factory at College Point, Long Island, Seversky's patents were the primary assets of the new company. Resolved to invest in research and design rather than relying on licence-manufacturing, many of Seversky Aircraft's designers were Russian and Georgian engineers, including Chief Engineer Michael Gregor and Alexander Kartveli. Along with Seversky, the designers embarked on an advanced all-metal, multi-place monoplane amphibian, the SEV-3. This ground-breaking design would go on to set numerous speed records at the 1933-1939 National Air Races, often piloted by Seversky himself, who was the company's greatest [...] "pitchman". On September 15, 1935, flying at a speed just over 230 mph, Seversky set a world speed record for <b>piston-engine</b> amphibious <b>aircraft.</b> Seversky also set a transcontinental speed record in 1938.|$|R
5000|$|By 1944, {{intelligence}} {{experts at}} Wright Field had developed lists of advanced aviation equipment {{they wanted to}} examine. Watson and his crew, nicknamed [...] "Watson's Whizzers" [...] and composed of pilots, engineers and maintenance men, used these [...] "Black Lists" [...] to collect aircraft. Watson organized his Whizzers into two sections. One collected jet aircraft and the other procured <b>piston-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> and nonflyable jet and rocket equipment.|$|E
5000|$|Publication in the USA Federal Register of an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking by the USA EPA {{occurred}} in April 2010.

5000|$|Early {{gasoline}} (petrol) {{internal combustion}} engines used a magneto ignition system, since no battery was fitted to the vehicle; magnetos are still used in <b>piston-engine</b> <b>aircraft.</b> The voltage {{produced by a}} magneto {{is dependent on the}} speed of the engine, making starting difficult. A battery-operated coil can provide a high-voltage spark even at low speeds, making starting easier. [...] When batteries became common in automobiles for cranking and lighting, the ignition coil system displaced magneto ignition.|$|E

50|$|In December 1994, two {{entrepreneurs}} {{from the}} Turks and Caicos Islands, Harold Charles (a native of Haiti) and John Shearer, joined forces {{putting together a}} hangar facility and 2 small <b>piston-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> to form a small charter airline. The first revenue flight took place in January 1995. In 1996 scheduled services began using a mixed fleet {{of a total of}} eight Cessna 400 and Piper PA-23 aircraft, after which larger Short 360 aircraft were added. Over the following years, SkyKing bought some Beechcraft 1900, which eventually became the only aircraft type in the fleet.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{the success}} of the Fatman variants, {{profitability}} was too dependent on the roller coaster cycles of the agricultural industry worldwide. Subsequently, Gippsland Aeronautics' second new design, the GA8 Airvan, was conceived by directors/designers Furlong and Morgan as a utility transport to replace the Cessna 206/207 and DHC Beaver. Recognising the Cessna 206 as [...] "one of the world’s best workhorses", the pair saw the potential niche market for a <b>piston-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> that could carry more passengers. This would improve the operators’ profitability without going to the expense of purchasing a turbine powered aircraft.|$|E
50|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, Soviet {{international}} and internal trunk routes were served by Aeroflot, the state airline, using jet or turboprop powered airliners, but their local services, {{many of which}} operated from grass airfields, were served by obsolete <b>piston-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> such as the Ilyushin Il-12, Il-14 and Lisunov Li-2. Aeroflot wanted to replace these elderly airliners with a turbine-powered aircraft, with the Yakovlev design bureau being assigned to design it. High speed was not required, {{but it would have}} to be able to operate safely and reliably out of poorly equipped airports with short (less than 700 m or 2,300 ft) unpaved runways in poor weather.|$|E
50|$|TEL {{remains an}} {{ingredient}} of 100 octane avgas for <b>piston-engine</b> <b>aircraft.</b> The current formulation of 100LL (low lead, blue) aviation gasoline contains 2.12 grams of TEL per gallon, half {{the amount of}} the previous 100/130 (green) octane avgas (at 4.24 grams per gallon), but only slightly less than the 2.2 grams per gallon historically permitted in automotive leaded gasoline and substantially greater than the allowed 0.001 grams per gallon in automotive unleaded gasoline sold in the United States today. The United States Environmental Protection Agency, FAA, and others are working on economically feasible replacements for leaded avgas, which still releases 100 tons of lead every year.|$|E
5000|$|Due to lead {{pollution}} risks, {{the use of}} leaded auto gas {{began to}} be phased out in the mid-1970s. But most small airplanes, including <b>piston-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> and some smaller jets, still run on leaded fuel, known as [...] "avgas." [...] In December 2014, CEH reached legal agreements with 26 avgas providers in California requiring them to not use or sell gasoline with a lead content greater than 0.56 grams per liter, which is significantly lower than many fuel mixes. The settlement called on the companies to sell avgas [...] "with the lowest concentration of lead approved for aviation use that is commercially available," [...] and required them to post warning signs around airports.|$|E
50|$|The M.C. 72 {{held the}} world speed record for all {{aircraft}} for five years. For comparison, the record holder for a land-based aircraft was held (for a time) by the Hughes H-1 Racer {{with a top}} speed of only 566 km/h (352 mph). Then in 1939, two German racing aircraft passed the M.C. 72. The first was a Heinkel prototype fighter which reached the speed of 746 km/h (463 mph). The second was the Messerschmitt Me 209's first prototype, which set a new world speed record of 756 km/h (469 mph) in August - just days before the start of World War II. The current world speed record for a <b>piston-engine</b> <b>aircraft</b> is 528.33 mph (850.26 km/h) set by a heavily modified Grumman F8F Bearcat named Rare Bear over three km in 1989. However, the M.C. 72 record still stands today as the world's fastest propeller-driven seaplane.|$|E
50|$|The first {{prototype}} {{was completed}} {{in the summer of}} 1940, but the HeS 8 intended to power it was running into difficulties. On 22 September 1940, while work on the engine continued, the first prototype started glide tests with ballasted pods hung in place of its engines. It would be another six months before Fritz Schäfer would take the second prototype into the air under its own power, on 30 March 1941. The type was then demonstrated to Ernst Udet, head of RLM's development wing, on 5 April, but like its predecessor, it apparently failed to make an impression. One benefit of the He 280 which did impress the political leadership {{was the fact that the}} jet engines could burn kerosene, which requires much less expense and refining than the high-octane fuel used by <b>piston-engine</b> <b>aircraft.</b> However, government funding was lacking at the critical stage of initial development.|$|E
