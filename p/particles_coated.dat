40|$|International audienceDry <b>particle</b> <b>coating</b> {{can be used}} {{to create}} new-generation {{materials}} by combining different powders exhibiting different physical and/or chemical properties. In such processes relatively large particles (host <b>particles)</b> are mechanically <b>coated</b> with fine <b>particles</b> (guest particles), without using solvents and subsequent drying, to create new functionalities or to improve initial characteristics. The coating of a host powder by guest particles can be performed in many different ways ranging from simple stirring of two components, to high energy impact coating. The purpose here is to examine the use of a Cyclomix high shear mixer granulator for the surface modification of silica <b>particles</b> by dry <b>coating</b> with magnesium stearate, and of cornstarch dry coated with hydrophilic or hydrophobic fume silica. Several powder characterisation methods have been used to study the physicochemical properties of the <b>coated</b> <b>particles.</b> These include: Observation by environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), Characterization of cohesion and flowability by tap density measurements, Determination of wettability by measurements of the contact angle between the <b>coated</b> <b>particles</b> and water. Measurement of moisture adsorption-desorption isotherms of uncoated and <b>coated</b> <b>particles,</b> and Tribo-electrification characteristics of the powders. The results show that the surface properties of the two host particles are changed, and that the Cyclomix can be used for dry <b>particle</b> <b>coating</b> to modify the properties of silica gel and cornstarch powders.

In this work, we studied {{the effect of}} the <b>particle</b> <b>coating</b> as doping method on microstructure and electrical properties of Sb-doped BaTiO 3. The advanced doping method involved surface-coated BaTiO 3 particles with a thin film of a metal-organic precursor solution. Results were compared with the performance obtained on conventional doping method. The <b>particle</b> <b>coating</b> as doping method led to an effective grain growth inhibition as well as significant microstructure improvement. The incorporation of dopant into the perovskite lattice is influenced by the doping method. Results suggested that Sb acted as donor dopant on A or/and B sites, and also as acceptor on B sites, modifying the grain boundaries structure characteristics. Dopant incorporation method affected the defect structure, and therefore, the donor dopant concentration for the semiconductor insulator transition in BaTiO 3 ceramics. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of composite particles using dry powder coating is a one-step, environmentally friendly, {{process for the}} fabrication of particles with targeted properties and favourable functionalities.

Dry <b>particle</b> <b>coating</b> is a solvent- and heat-free process {{that can be used}} to develop functionalised particles.

Thus, by recording the displacement of tracer oscillations, FSM can gauge and derive the magnitude of forces exerted by active motor proteins.|$|E
40|$|Although foamed bitumen {{has been}} widely applied in {{pavement}} construction some of its aspects are still not yet understood. In this study, some of these aspects including: effects of the foaming process on binder chemistry, characterization of foamed bitumen and development of a rational method to optimize foam characteristics, evaluation of aggregate <b>particle</b> <b>coating</b> within foamed bitumen treated materials, and development of a gyratory compaction procedure for laterite gravels treated with foamed bitumen were addressed. The effects of the foaming process on bitumen chemistry were investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques. Also, foam characteristics of three binders were established and a rational method to optimize foam characteristics proposed. Aggregate <b>particle</b> <b>coating</b> with foamed bitumen was studied using the concepts of surface energy and Rice density. In addition a gyratory laboratory compaction procedure for laterite gravels treated with foamed bitumen was established using the modified locking concept. Infrared techniques have shown that foaming does not cause any changes in the binder chemistry, suggesting that foaming may be a physical process. Further, foam characteristics are greatly influenced by binder viscosity. Also, the equiviscous temperature seems to produce foam with optimum foam characteristics. Rice density results showed that aggregate size fraction, binder expansion ratio and viscosity influenced aggregate <b>particle</b> <b>coating.</b> Surface energy results revealed that foamed bitumen exhibited better coating attributes than neat bitumen. A new compaction procedure for laterite gravels treated with foamed bitumen based on the modified locking point was developed. QC 2011042...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{modified}} RESS {{process for}} <b>particle</b> <b>coating</b> {{with a solution}} of polymer in supercritical CO 2 was studied in this research. This technique involves extracting the polymer with supercritical CO 2, {{with or without a}} cosolvent in an extraction vessel, and then precipitating the polymer onto the surface of host particles in a second precipitation vessel by adjusting the pressure and temperature inside the precipitator to lower its solubility. The research was performed using a pilot‐scale supercritical apparatus, glass beads as host particles and two different polymers as coating materials. Experiments showed that the coating of glass beads with polyvinyl chloride‐co‐vinyl acetate (PVCVA) and hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) was successfully achieved. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X‐ray spectrometry (EDS), energy dispersive X‐ray mapping and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to characterize the coatings obtained.

40|$|Background: Silver {{nanoparticles}} (AgNPs) act as antimicrobials {{by releasing}} monovalent silver (Ag+) and are increasingly used in consumer products, thus elevating exposures in human and environmental populations. Materials and Methods: We evaluated Ag+ {{in a standard}} model of neuronal cell replication and differentiation, and then determined whether there were similar effects of the ion in vivo using zebrafish. Next, we compared Ag+ and AgNP exposures in the same two models and incorporated the effects of <b>particle</b> <b>coating,</b> size and composition. Conclusions: This work {{is the first to}} show that both Ag+ and AgNPs are developmental neurotoxicants in vitro and in vivo.
