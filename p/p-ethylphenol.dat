40|$|The denitrifying “Aromatoleum aromaticum ” strain EbN 1 was {{demonstrated}} to utilize <b>p-ethylphenol</b> under anoxic conditions and was suggested {{to employ a}} degradation pathway which is reminiscent of known anaerobic ethylbenzene degradation in the same bacterium: initial hydroxylation of <b>p-ethylphenol</b> to 1 -(4 -hydroxyphenyl) -ethanol followed by dehydrogenation to p-hydroxyacetophenone. Possibly, subsequent carboxylation and thio-lytic cleavage yield p-hydroxybenzoyl-coenzyme A (CoA), which is channeled into the central benzoyl-CoA pathway. Substrate-specific formation {{of three of the}} four proposed intermediates was confirmed by gas chromato-graphic-mass spectrometric analysis and also by applying deuterated <b>p-ethylphenol.</b> Proteins suggested to be involved in this degradation pathway are encoded in a single large operon-like structure (15 kb). Among them are a p-cresol methylhydroxylase-like protein (PchCF), two predicted alcohol dehydrogenases (ChnA and EbA 309), a biotin-dependent carboxylase (XccABC), and a thiolase (TioL). Proteomic analysis (two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis) revealed their specific and coordinated upregulation in cells adapted to anaerobic growth with <b>p-ethylphenol</b> and p-hydroxyacetophenone (e. g., PchF up to 29 -fold). Coregulated proteins of currently unknown function (e. g., EbA 329) are possibly involved in p-ethylphenol- and p-hydroxyacetophenone-specific solvent stress responses and related to other aromatic solvent-induced proteins of strain EbN 1...|$|E

The synthesis of phenolic resin {{was carried out by}} using <b>p-ethylphenol,</b> formaldehyde and naphthol. The structures of phenolic and epoxy resins were confirmed by spectroscopic analysis. The synthesized epoxy resin showed solubility in polar solvents like DMF, dioxane, acetone, DMSO, THF, ethyl acetate, and chloroform. Thermal characterization of epoxy resin was monitored by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) using curing agent and thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA).

40|$|We {{report the}} electrocatalytic {{activity}} of ethylbenzene dehydrogenase (EBDH) from the β-proteobacterium Aromatoleum aromaticum. EBDH {{is a complex}} 155 kDa heterotrimeric molybdenum/iron–sulfur/heme protein which catalyzes the enantioselective hydroxylation of nonactivated ethylbenzene to (S) - 1 -phenylethanol without molecular oxygen as cosubstrate. Furthermore, it oxidizes {{a wide range of}} other alkyl-substituted aromatic and heterocyclic compounds to their secondary alcohols. Hydroxymethylferrocenium (FM) is used as an artificial electron acceptor for EBDH in an electrochemically driven catalytic system. Electrocatalytic activity of EBDH is demonstrated with both its native substrate ethylbenzene and the related substrate <b>p-ethylphenol.</b> The catalytic system has been modeled by electrochemical simulation across a range of sweep rates and concentrations of each substrate, which provides new insights into the kinetics of the EBDH catalytic mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Cleavage of phenetole {{has been}} studied in {{presence}} of HCl and the mixed-oxide cat-alysts and the catalyst alone without HC!. Cleavage takes place in case of Alz 03 -ZrOz, Ah 03 -Mo 03, Alz 0 3 -SiOz, SiOz-ZrOz and SiOz- TiOz catalysts {{in the presence of}} HCl in non-aqueous media. In addition to cleavage, rearrangement also takes place in all the above cases giving 0 -, <b>p-ethylphenols</b> along with phenol in the reaction mixture. This has been confirmed by IR studies, gas chromatography and chemical analysis of the reaction prod-uct. Since the above mixed-oxide catalysts have dual sites (acidic and basic sites) on the surface, reactions were also carried out with phenetole solutions in benzene and n-hexane in the presence of these catalysts without HC!. It was observed that only rearrangement took place giving only 0 -, <b>p-ethylphenols</b> and no phenol was formed in all cases. This clearly proves that the catalyst is responsible for rearrangement. The cleavage is brought about by the HCl adsorbed on the catalyst surface. Taking advantage of the existence of the dual sites (acidic and basic sites) present on the surface of catalysts, a mechanism for the reaction has been proposed. The agreement between the acidity and basicity values calculated from our cleavage results and those from measured values supports the mechanism proposed by us, i. e., basic sites (in the presence of HC 1) are responsible for the cleavage of phenetole and acid cen-tres are responsible for re-arrangement of phenetole and this holds good in general for aromatic ethers...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} synthesis and processing aspects of fimctionalized polymer/inorganic nanocomposites, specifically polyphenol nanocomposite materials incorporating (a) nanostuctured cadmium sulfide (CdS), and (b) nanocrystalline vanadium pentoxide (V 2 O 5). It also explores their structure-property relationships including optical properties. This study therefore included: the hematin catalyzed polymerization of ethylphenol; synthesis of US nanoparticles within reversed micelles and their dispersion in a polymer matrix; {{investigation of the}} surface chemistry of US, which {{is related to the}} properties of polymer-CdS nanocomposites; synthesis of nanostructured polymer/V 2 O 5 via a combinatorial chemo-enzymatic sol-gel process; and optical characterization of the materials obtained. ^ The dehydrogenation of phenol compounds (<b>p-ethylphenol),</b> and polymer formation from these monomers, was studied using a novel biocatalyst hematin. The mechanism studies and kinetics of the polymerization reaction indicated that phenol radicals were formed by a two step electron transfer reaction catalyzed by hematin {{in the presence of a}} peroxide. ^ CdS semiconductor nanocrystallites were synthesized in reversed micelles with subsequent in situ enzymatic copolymerization of <b>p-ethylphenol</b> and 4 -hydroxythiophenol in the same medium. Consequently, CdS nanocrystallites were incorporated into the polymer matrix to form spherical polymer/inorganic composites with surface hydroxyl groups. The polymer/CdS core was then dispersed into polycarbonate by copolymerization. The polymer/CdS nanocomposites showed higher optical absorbance in the UV-VIS range when compared to the polymer matrix without CdS. ^ Vanadium pentoxide (V 2 O 5) xerogels were prepared by the sol-gel process. The generation of V 2 O 5 was optimized by a combinatorial approach incorporating rapid screening by Raman spectroscopy. Subsequently, poly(p-ethylphenol) (PEP) /V 2 O 5 nanocomposites were prepared by the chemo-enzymatic/sol-gel process. ^ Composites with dispersed CdS (1. 0 wt%) had a third order nonlinear optical susceptibility, χ(3), of ∼ 2. 5 × 10 − 10 e. s. u. Vanadium pentoxide nanocomposites (1. 0 wt%) exhibited a χ(3) of ∼ 2. 0 × 10 − 10 e. s. u. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{properties}} of the microheterogeneous systems formed by mixtures of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and an alternating copolymer of maleic acid and styrene, MAS, and their anionic monoesters, MAS-n with n = 2, 4, 6, 8, were investigated. The fluorescence of pyrene was used to sense the polarity of the polymer/CTAB aggregates. Measurements of the ratio III/I in pyrene fluorescence spectra indicate that the polymer/CTAB aggregates are more hydrophobic than normal micelles. A series of p-alkyl substituted phenols were employed to probe the solubilization ability of these aggregates. The distribution constant K-S of phenol, p-methylphenol, <b>p-ethylphenol,</b> and p-propylphenol between water and MAS-n/CTAB aggregates and the corresponding free energy of transfer Alto have been determined using the pseudo-phase model. The {{results show that the}} distribution is mainly determined by the phenol structure, and a linear free energy relationship has been fpund between Deltamu(t) (0) and the structure of the phenols. On the other hand, {{an increase in the number}} of methylene groups in the side alkyl chain has no effect on Deltamu(t) (0). The results are discussed and compared with those obtained for ionic micelles...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} an ultraviolet resonance Raman (UVRR) spectrometer appropriate for structural studies of biological macromolecules and their assemblies. Instrument design {{includes the following}} features: a continuous wave, intracavity doubled, ultraviolet laser source for excitation of the Raman spectrum; a rotating cell (or jet source) for presentation of the sample to the laser beam; a Cassegrain optic with f/ 1. 0 aperture for collection of the Raman scattering; a quartz prism dispersing element for rejection of stray light and Rayleigh scattering; a 0. 75 -m single grating monochromator for dispersion of the Raman scattering; and a liquid-nitrogen-cooled, charge-coupled device for detection of the Raman photons. The performance of this instrument, assessed {{on the basis of}} the observed signal-to-noise ratios, the apparent resolution of closely spaced spectral bands, and the wide spectrometer bandpass of 2200 cm- 1, is believed superior to previously described UVRR spectrometers of similar design. Performance characteristics of the instrument are demonstrated in UVRR spectra obtained from standard solvents, <b>p-ethylphenol,</b> which serves as a model for the tyrosine side chain, the DNA nucleotide deoxyguanosine- 5 '-monophosphate, and the human tumor necrosis factor binding protein, which is considered representative of soluble globular proteins...|$|E
40|$|A new {{analytical}} procedure is developed to couple supercritical fluid extraction with capillary electrochromatography (SFE-CEC) to extract and determine phenols in soil. Ten phenols consisting of phenol, methylphenols (p-cresol and o-cresol), dimethylphenols (3, 5 -xylenol, 3, 4 -xylenol and 2, 6 -xylenol), trimethylphenol, ethylphenols (<b>p-ethylphenol</b> and o-ethylphenol), and o-isopropylphenol are investigated. The use of supercritical CO 2 with 10 % methanol as the organic modifier {{was found to}} give satisfactory extraction of alkylphenols from soil at 1200 p. s. i. and 50 °C for 45 min under a total extractant flow-rate of 0. 2 ml/min (1 p. s. i. = 6894. 76 Pa). Baseline resolution was achieved for the 10 selected phenols under optimised CEC conditions at 20 kV in a mobile phase of acetonitrile- 4 mM Tris, pH 7. 0 (35 : 65) in a 45 cm (25 cm packed with 3 μm ODS) × 75 μm I. D. fused-silica capillary column. Using SFE with a 10 -fold preconcentration factor, all alkyl-substituted phenols in soil can be determined with detection limits ranging from 0. 0032 to 0. 014 mg/kg and working range from 0. 019 to 2. 72 mg/kg. The SFE-CEC procedure developed has been applied successfully to determine phenols extracted from real soil sample contaminated with medical disinfectant. It will provide a rapid method for the direct determination of phenol and alkyl-substituted phenol in soils, with capability for confirmation of unknown peaks. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Sulfonation is an {{important}} metabolic process involved in the excretion {{and in some cases}} activation of various endogenous compounds and xenobiotics. This reaction is catalyzed by a family of enzymes named sulfotransferases. The cytosolic human sulfotransferases SULT 1 A 1 and SULT 1 A 3 have overlapping yet distinct substrate specificities. SULT 1 A 1 favors simple phenolic substrates such as p-nitrophenol, whereas SULT 1 A 3 prefers monoamine substrates such as dopamine. In this study we have used a variety of phenolic substrates to functionally characterize the role of the amino acid at position 146 in SULT 1 A 1 and SULT 1 A 3. First, the mutation A 146 E in SULT 1 A 1 yielded a SULT 1 A 3 -like protein with respect to the Michaelis constant for simple phenols. The mutation E 146 A in SULT 1 A 3 resulted in a SULT 1 A 1 -like protein with respect to the Michaelis constant for both simple phenols and monoamine compounds. When comparing the specificity of SULT 1 A 3 toward tyramine with that for <b>p-ethylphenol</b> (which differs from tyramine in having no amine group on the carbon side chain), we saw a 200 -fold preference for tyramine. The kinetic data obtained with the E 146 A mutant of SULT 1 A 3 for these two substrates clearly showed that this protein preferred substrates without an amine group attached. Second, changing the glutamic acid at position 146 of SULT 1 A 3 to a glutamine, thereby neutralizing the negative charge at this position, resulted in a 360 -fold decrease in the specificity constant for dopamine.

The study on p-alkyl substituted phenols performed by laser induced fluorescence in a supersonic jet provided rich information of the electronic and vibrational structures of p-alkyl substituted phenols in the excited state as well as in the ground state. This study also provided a convenient method for the identification of conformational isomers of molecules in the excited state by observing fluorescence excitation spectra of the molecules to be studied;The study of TMCBD performed by fluorescence and low temperature polarized absorption spectroscopies provided an alternative technique for the study of electronic structures of molecules which cannot be studied in the gas phase under high resolution conditions due to the low fluorescence quantum yields or low vapor pressures of the molecules to be studied. These studies along with polarized infrared spectroscopy provided enough information about the electronic structure of TMCBD to resolve and confirm several arguments on the S[subscript] 1 ([superscript] 1 A[subscript] u) leftharpoons S[subscript] 0 ([superscript] 1 A[subscript] g) transition. These experiments confirm the point symmetry group change to TMCBD upon excitation to the first excited singlet state (S[subscript] 1), the symmetry of progression forming modes, the observation of C-H stretching vibrations in the S[subscript] 1 state, and the existence of a double minimum potential in the S[subscript] 1 state.

40|$|The H-atom {{detachment}} driven {{through the}} 1 πσ* states of biological chromophores containing an X-H bond (where X = N or O) upon UV absorption is ubiquitous in nature. Understanding {{the role of}} this dissociative state in the chromophores and their respective amino acids following UV excitation would enable a step change towards establishing {{a better understanding of}} the mechanisms of photostability of larger peptides in the gas-phase. The work presented in this thesis focuses on the H-atom elimination of phenol and indole, the chromophores of the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan, respectively. The H-atom elimination has also been carried out in tyrosine and its sub-units <b>p-ethylphenol</b> and tyramine upon excitation at 200 nm. In all these systems the O-H bond fission on the phenol ring results in a range of H-atoms kinetic energy release. Using a combination of femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy, time-offlight mass spectroscopy (TOF-MS) and velocity map ion imaging (VMI) reveals that H-atom elimination in all these systems occurs on an ultrafast timescale (~ 200 fs) for both fast and slow H-atoms. This casts considerable doubt over the previously assigned statistical origin of the slow H-atoms and suggests direct pathways to their formation. The H-atom kinetic energy spectrum in tyrosine also implies that H-atom elimination is occurring through the same coordinate i. e. O-H bond as exhibited by it’s phenol chromophore, thus confirming the active participation of the 1 πσ* states from the chromophore of the amino acid to the amino acid itself. These findings are of great importance enabling one to compare these results with existing calculations on the chromophores which often model the system in an isolated environment. These results also provide ground work for more complex calculation to be carried out, in particular on the amino acids and the di/tri peptides.
