40|$|Two helium refrigerators, each {{rated for}} 3. 5 KW at 20 K, are used at NASA s Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Building No. 32 to provide {{cryo-pumping}} within two large thermal-vacuum chambers. These refrigerators were originally commissioned in 1996. Equipment refurbishment and upgrades to {{the controls of}} these refrigerators were recently completed. This paper describes some of the mechanical and control issues that necessitated the equipment refurbishment and controls change-over. It will describe the modifications and the new process control which allows the refrigerators {{to take advantage of}} the Ganni Cycle "floating pressure" control technology. The upgrades [...] the controls philosophy change-over to the floating pressure control technology and the newly refurbished equipment [...] have greatly improved the performance, stability, and efficiency of these two refrigerators. The upgrades have also given the operators more information and details about the operational status of the main components (compressors, expanders etc.) of the refrigerators at all operating conditions (i. e. : at various loads in the vacuum chambers).

40|$|Several {{projects}} have been completed or are nearing completion at the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) National Transonic Facility (NTF). The addition of a Model Flow-Control/Propulsion Simulation test capability to the NTF provides a unique, transonic, high-Reynolds number test capability that is well suited for research in propulsion airframe integration studies, circulation control high-lift concepts, powered lift, and cruise separation flow control. A 1992 vintage Facility Automation System (FAS) that performs the control functions for tunnel pressure, temperature, Mach number, model position, safety interlock and supervisory controls was replaced using current, commercially available components. This FAS upgrade also involved a design study for {{the replacement of the}} facility Mach measurement system {{and the development of a}} software-based simulation model of NTF processes and control systems. The FAS upgrades were validated by a <b>post</b> <b>upgrade</b> verification wind tunnel test.
