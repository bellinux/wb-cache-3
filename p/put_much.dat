5|$|Since then, Ikata has <b>put</b> <b>much</b> {{effort into}} {{expanding}} the horizons {{of its residents}} through English language education via the JET Programme, and an annual international student exchange with Red Wing. Beginning in 1995, Ikata middle school students have traveled almost yearly to Red Wing for home stays of one to two weeks, and students from Red Wing likewise come to Ikata to learn about life in rural Japan.|$|E
5|$|Calisthenics, {{especially}} as {{done in the}} huge formations favored at the time, could be boring, and {{at the high school}} and college levels, games such as baseball and rugby were more often spectator sports than a practical source of physical exercise for the masses. Moreover, at elite levels, baseball, football, and even judo did not <b>put</b> <b>much</b> emphasis on moral or intellectual development. Instead, elite coaches and athletes tended to emphasize winning, at almost any cost.|$|E
5|$|Burnside's {{road system}} was {{completely}} bitumenised during the 1960s and 1970s through government-sponsored roadworks programmes. Plans were also laid out {{to replace the}} winding and dangerous Mount Barker Road. One of these proposals was the Burnside-Crafers Highway, which was strongly supported by council; it envisaged leaving Greenhill Road once reaching Hazelwood Park. It was then to pass through Hazelwood Park and Beaumont, wind around the hills of Waterfall Gully and then go over Eagle on the Hill to meet Crafers. The Burnside Council <b>put</b> <b>much</b> effort into this proposal, widening Linden Avenue (which runs north-west to south-east) {{in preparation for the}} highway. The proposal was eventually rejected in favour of upgrading Mount Barker Road and Linden Avenue remained a huge out-of-place road running through an otherwise peaceful suburb.|$|E

5|$|Due to a miscommunication, the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPDC) {{failed to}} follow its own search {{parameters}} in Rock Creek Park, leaving Levy's body to decompose for a year. Furthermore, the MPDC had been informed, and soon dismissed, that Ingmar Guandique, already arrested for attacking women in Rock Creek Park, had confessed to attacking Levy. The MPDC instead <b>put</b> <b>much</b> of {{its focus on}} the revelation that Levy {{was having an affair}} with Congressman Gary Condit, a married Democrat then serving his fifth term representing California's 18th congressional district, and a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Condit had an overwhelming alibi (he was in meetings with the Vice President), was never named as a suspect by police and was eventually cleared of any involvement in the disappearance. However, due to the cloud of suspicion raised by the intense media focus on the missing intern and the later revelation of the affair, Condit lost his bid for re-election in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The most {{complete}} {{books on the}} Pony Express are The Story of the Pony Express and Saddles and Spurs by Raymond & Mary Settle and Roy Bloss. Settle's account is unique as {{he was the first}} writer and historical researcher to make use of Pony Express founder William B. Waddell's papers, now in a collection at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. Mr. Settle wrote in the mid-1950s. Mr. Bloss was a writer for the Pony Express Centennial. While Settle's work was published generally without his annotations and notes, the writer's background here is unique and Settle does have an excellent bibliography. When Settle prepared to publish his well-researched account he had a good volume of footnotes, citations prepared, but the editors chose not to use most of them. Instead, they opted for a less expensive approach to print and publish and released an accurate, but simplified account. Settle was not pleased with this new and sudden development, as he <b>put</b> <b>much</b> time and effort into the annotations. Yet, the account Settle wrote was and is a definitive one and is considered the best account {{on the history of the}} Pony Express amongst many historians.|$|E
