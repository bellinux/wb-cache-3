5000|$|Some <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> {{have special}} voting rights to approve {{extraordinary}} events (such as {{the issuance of}} new shares or approval of the acquisition of a company) or to elect directors, but most <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> have no voting rights associated with them; some <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> gain voting rights when the preferred dividends are in arrears for a substantial time. This is all variable on the rights assigned to the <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> {{at the time of}} incorporation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Preferred</b> <b>shares</b> {{are often}} used by private {{corporations}} to achieve Canadian tax objectives. For instance, the use of <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> can allow a business to accomplish an estate freeze. By transferring common shares in exchange for fixed-value <b>preferred</b> <b>shares,</b> business owners can allow future gains {{in the value of}} the business to accrue to others (such as a discretionary trust).|$|R
50|$|The <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> of a {{split share}} {{corporation}} {{are intended to}} provide an investment vehicle for more conservative investors, one that provides a relatively high income stream and safety in the original investment that is secured by {{the value of the}} underlying basket of shares. Greater safety is provided since the <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> are given priority over the capital shares both when income is paid out and when the corporation is wrapped up. The income from the <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> is usually declared as dividend income, which in some jurisdictions (e.g. Canada) has favorable tax rates compared to the tax rates that apply to the interest income that is produced by bonds or commercial paper. The <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> of a split share corporation can offer greater diversification than the <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> of a single conventional corporation.|$|R

5000|$|Dividend {{payments}} on preferred stocks ("preference shares" [...] in the UK) are {{set out in}} the prospectus. The name of the <b>preferred</b> <b>share</b> will typically include its nominal yield: for example, a 6% <b>preferred</b> <b>share.</b> However, the dividend may under some circumstances be passed or reduced. The current yield is the ratio of the annual dividend to the current market price, which will vary.|$|E
50|$|Preferred stock can be {{considered}} part of debt or equity. Attributing <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> to {{one or the other}} is partially a subjective decision but will also take into account the specific features of the <b>preferred</b> <b>shares.</b>|$|R

5000|$|When a {{corporation}} goes bankrupt, {{there may be}} enough money to repay holders of preferred issues known as [...] "senior" [...] but not enough money for [...] "junior" [...] issues. Therefore, when <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> are first issued their governing document may contain protective provisions preventing the issuance of new <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> with a senior claim. Individual series of <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> may have a senior, pari-passu (equal), or junior relationship with other series issued by the same corporation.|$|R
50|$|Preferred stock {{rights have}} {{precedence}} over common stock. Therefore, dividends on <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> are subtracted before calculating the EPS. When <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> are cumulative, annual dividends are deducted {{whether or not}} they have been declared. Dividends in arrears are not relevant when calculating EPS.|$|R

50|$|The above list (which {{includes}} several customary rights) is not comprehensive; <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> (like other legal arrangements) may specify nearly any right conceivable. <b>Preferred</b> <b>shares</b> in the U.S. normally carry a call provision, enabling the issuing corporation to repurchase the share at its (usually limited) discretion.|$|R

50|$|<b>Preferred</b> <b>share</b> {{conversions}} {{are usually}} {{done on a}} dollar-for-dollar basis. $1,000 face value of preferreds will be exchanged for $1,000 worth of common shares (at market value). As the common shares increase in value, the preferreds will dilute them less (in terms of percent-ownership), and vice versa. In terms of value dilution, there will be none {{from the point of}} view of the shareholder. Since most shareholders are invested in the belief the stock price will increase, this is not a problem.|$|E
50|$|In the United States {{there are}} two types of {{preferred}} stocks: straight preferreds and convertible preferreds. Straight preferreds are issued in perpetuity (although some are subject to call by the issuer, under certain conditions) and pay a stipulated rate of interest to the holder. Convertible preferreds—in addition to the foregoing features of a straight preferred—contain a provision by which the holder may convert the preferred into the common stock of the company (or, sometimes, into the common stock of an affiliated company) under certain conditions (among which may be the specification of a future date when conversion may begin, a certain number of common shares per <b>preferred</b> <b>share</b> or a certain price per share for the common stock).|$|E
50|$|<b>Preferred</b> <b>share</b> {{represents}} {{some degree}} of ownership in a company but usually doesn't come with the same voting rights. (This may {{vary depending on the}} company.) With preferred shares investors are usually guaranteed a fixed dividend forever. This is different than common stock, which has variable dividends that are never guaranteed. Another advantage is that in the event of liquidation preferred shareholders are paid off before the common shareholder (but still after debt holders). Preferred stock may also be callable, meaning that the company has the option to purchase the shares from shareholders at any time for any reason (usually for a premium).Some people consider preferred stock to be more like debt than equity.|$|E

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis has highlighted the opportunistic conduct of some banks, which {{have taken advantage}} of the trust relationship with their clients to place them unsuitable products. In Spain, the distribution of <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> among retail clients has created a problem of enormous proportions. <b>Preferred</b> <b>shares</b> are a high-risk complex financial instrument, with which you can lose all the capital invested.

50|$|<b>Preferred</b> <b>shares</b> {{represent}} {{a significant portion}} of Canadian capital markets, with over C$11.2 billion in new <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> issued in 2016. Many Canadian issuers are financial organizations which may count capital raised in the preferred-share market as Tier 1 capital (provided that the shares issued are perpetual). Another class of issuer includes split share corporations. Investors in Canadian <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> are generally those who wish to hold fixed-income investments in a taxable portfolio. Preferential tax treatment of dividend income (as opposed to interest income) may, in many cases, result in a greater after-tax return than might be achieved with bonds.|$|R
50|$|The {{preferred}} {{and capital}} {{shares of the}} split corporation are issued in some fixed ratio. Often the preferred and capital shares are issued in precisely equal numbers. In such a case, each pair of preferred and capital shares is sometimes called a unit. However, the proportion of preferred and capital shares does not necessarily have to be one-to-one. Reducing the ratio of issued preferred shares to capital shares (e.g., one <b>preferred</b> <b>share</b> for every two capital shares) would reduce the risk and safely support higher yield for the preferred shares {{at the cost of}} making the capital shares less attractive to investors due to increased risk, lower sustainable yield payout and smaller capital gain leverage.|$|E
5000|$|Convertible {{preferred}} stock—These are preferred {{issues which}} holders can {{exchange for a}} predetermined number of the company's common-stock shares. This exchange may occur at any time the investor chooses, regardless of the market price of the common stock. It is a one-way deal; one cannot convert the common stock back to preferred stock. A variant {{of this is the}} anti-dilutive convertible preferred recently made popular by investment banker Stan Medley who structured several variants of these preferred for some forty plus public companies. In the variants used by Stan Medley the <b>preferred</b> <b>share</b> converts to either a percentage of the company's common shares or a fixed dollar amount of common shares rather than a set number of shares of common. The intention is to ameliorate the bad effects investors suffer from rampant shorting and dilutive efforts on the OTC markets.|$|E
5000|$|By October 1929, Loblaw Groceterias' rapid {{expansion}} had {{attracted the attention}} of competitor Dominion Stores Limited, another Toronto-based food store chain. In a letter to its shareholders, Dominion management put forward a plan to purchase a controlling interest in Loblaw, funded by a <b>preferred</b> <b>share</b> offering. Weeks later, though, stock markets around the world collapsed and theproposed acquisition never took place.In spite of the onset of the Great Depression, Loblaw continued to expand,albeit at a slower pace. By 1930, the chain boasted of 97 [...] "spotlessly cleanGroceterias" [...] in Ontario. By 1936, that number had grown to 111, but press reportsindicated the company had curtailed further expansion in order to increasethe scope of its product offerings at the chain's existing outlets. Meanwhile, thecompany made a partial retreat from the U.S. market with the sale of its 77Loblaw Groceterias Inc. stores in Chicago, Illinois, to the Jewel TeaCompany. The stores had never shown a profit, although they had largelybeen turned around {{by the time of the}} sale. The company retained its 50stores in Buffalo, New York, which were profitable operations.|$|E
