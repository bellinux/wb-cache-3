5000|$|In 1943, the {{furniture}} designer Gordon Russell {{invited her to}} {{become a member of the}} Board of Trade Utility Furniture Design Advisory Panel, which was tasked with implementing wartime austerity standards in the field of interior and furniture design. She became responsible for its range of textiles, eventually creating over 30 commissioned designs. This work represented a challenge for the designer because the patterns had to be attractive yet simple in design and inexpensive to manufacture. Marx worked within the restraints of a limited number of looms, four board-selected colors, and only two yarn types. Unlike her experience with the London <b>Passenger</b> Transport <b>commissions,</b> Marx found the process of collaboration with manufacturers on Utility Furniture textiles to be a successful one. The textile patterns were primarily geometric, although Marx also introduced some floral motifs after seeking feedback from her charwoman.|$|R

50|$|Due {{to the low}} {{population}} density in the catchment area of the section of line, ZVMS {{is not expected to}} <b>commission</b> <b>passenger</b> services to Neuhausen. Currently, the capacity reduction approved by the Federal Railway Office (Eisenbahn-Bundesamt)—a reduction of the target speed from the current maximum of 40 to 10 or 20 km/h—is planned to be implemented at the timetable change of June 2014. From 6 February to 6 May 2014, DB RegioNetz Infrastruktur GmbH, the current owner of the infrastructure, sought expressions of interest from companies willing to take over the Olbernhau-Grünthal-Neuhausen section as a railway infrastructure company in order to continue to operate public transport at their own risk.|$|R
50|$|Olafur {{has been}} {{developing}} various experiments with atmospheric density in exhibition spaces. In Room For One Colour (1998), a corridor lit by yellow monofrequency tubes, the participants {{find themselves in a}} room filled with light that affects the perception of all other colours. Another installation, 360 degrees Room For All Colours (2002), is a round light-sculpture where participants lose their sense of space and perspective, and experience being subsumed by an intense light. Olafur's later installation Din blinde passager (Your blind <b>passenger)</b> (2010), <b>commissioned</b> by the Arken Museum of Modern Art, is a 90-metre-long tunnel. Entering the tunnel, the visitor is surrounded by dense fog. With visibility at just 1.5 metres, museumgoers have to use senses other than sight to orient themselves in relation to their surroundings. For Feelings are facts, the first time Olafur has worked with Chinese architect Yansong Ma as well as his first exhibition in China, Olafur introduces condensed banks of artificially produced fog into the gallery of Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing. Hundreds of fluorescent lights are installed in the ceiling as a grid of red, green, and blue zones.|$|R
5000|$|... "Balfour & Co. by 1901 {{had already}} set {{themselves}} up as violin experts {{but in fact}} were shipping, <b>passenger,</b> and <b>commission</b> agents with little knowledge of the violin world. They claim to have discovered a “Stradivari of 1692, the finest {{in the world for}} sale at £1,000.” The violin was originally sold by William Voller to Balfour for £45 with no attempt to defraud or mislabel and thus takes its name from the company that subsequently offered it for sale. Balfours’ exploited this ‘find’ in a remarkable way; certificates given with enthusiasm and florid descriptions were gathered from Silvestre-Maucotel, Gustav Bernardel, Nestor Audinot, C.A. Chanot, F.W. Chanot and the wholesale firm of Beare & Sons - George Hart, J. &A. Beare and W.E. Hill & Sons were conspicuous by their absence. These certificates with translations surround Balfour & Co.’s general guarantee document. After an unsuccessful attempt to sell it at Puttnick's (where it was bought in) it was sold privately for £2,500. This prompted an anonymus letter stating : [...] "You know it is only a clever [...] "Fake" [...] and signed [...] "One who knows who made it". Once the new owner of the [...] "Balfour" [...] violin realized his mistake, civil court proceedings were instigated that resulted in an out-of-court settlement." ...|$|R
5000|$|As a screenwriter, Spaihts {{became known}} in the film {{industry}} as a [...] "go-to guy for space thrillers", when his science fiction romance Passengers was included on the 2007 Black List of unproduced high-value screenplays. Keanu Reeves and Stephen Hamel had hired Spaihts to write the film after originally becoming attached to Spaihts' abandoned science fiction script Shadow 19. After Reeves agreed to produce with Hamel and star in <b>Passengers,</b> Spaihts was <b>commissioned</b> by Scott Free to write the next installments in the Alien saga, two prequel films to be directed by Ridley Scott, which eventually turned into the more autonomous story Prometheus, ultimately revised by Damon Lindelof. For New Regency Spaihts also wrote the screenplay to the alien invasion thriller The Darkest Hour, based on a story by Leslie Bohem and M.T. Ahern.|$|R
50|$|Among the {{improvements}} was a fix for the motion sickness being experienced by <b>passengers.</b> The <b>commissioning</b> team had been {{well aware of}} this problem before it entered service, {{but this was not}} mentioned to the press when it was noticed on the public runs. The problem was due to two effects. One was that the control system did not respond instantly, so the cars tended to not respond when the curve first started, and then reacted rapidly to make up for this lag. The fix for this was to take information on the tilt from the car in front, giving the system the slight time advantage it needed. The other problem was similar to sea sickness, but in reverse. Sea sickness is caused when the body's equilibrioception system can feel movement, but inside a closed room this movement cannot be seen. On APT, one could easily see the tilting as the train entered turns, but there was no perception of this motion. The end result was the same, a confusion between the visual and the equilibrioception system. The solution was almost trivial; slightly reducing the amount of tilt to be deliberately less than needed resulted in a small amount of leftover centrifugal force that was perceived by the equilibrioception system as being perfectly natural, which proved to cure the effect.|$|R
40|$|This {{in-depth}} {{history of}} the interior design of ocean liners surveys the transient {{history of interior design}} in relation to the development of <b>passenger</b> shipping, from <b>commissioning</b> by the line owners, methods and sources for the original creation of designs through to its construction, use and influence. It is a short-lived branch of architecture and design, lasting an average of fifteen years. As the design and taste mirrors and reinforces cultural assumptions about national identity, gender, class and race, not only did the interiors of ocean going liners reflect the changing hierarchies of society and shifting patterns in globalization, but the glamour and styling of the liners were reflected back into the design of interiors on land.
