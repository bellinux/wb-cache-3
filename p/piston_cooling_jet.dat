40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} effects of <b>piston</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>jet</b> (PCJ) on the temperature and heat transfer of a piston. A numerical model was developed by using the computational fluid dynamic approach in which the fluid and solid domains of the piston were coupled in a three-dimensional space. Two-phase flow of oil and air was also simulated. This method was used to analyze {{the effects of}} oil velocity and piston position on the heat transfer coefficient {{at the bottom of the}} piston as the new outcomes of this study. For the experiment, combustion heat flux on the piston was simulated in a test rig, and numerical results were validated. The results showed a linear relation between the oil jet velocity and the average of heat transfer coefficient at the bottom of the piston, and a periodic correlation between the piston’s vertical position and the average of heat transfer coefficient. The average of the piston crown temperature could be reduced to about 70 K by using the PCJ system, but this cooling method could create 50 K temperature gradient in the piston...|$|E
40|$|Recently, with {{development}} in the output power and material cost efficiency, the value of thermal and mechanical stress on many engine parts such as piston is increased. On the other hands, the strength of aluminum alloys used for piston manufacturing decreases with temperature. So, for lightweight pistons, the strength reduction should be minimized to maintain the mechanical integrity of the part. This drives piston designers to use strong and lightweight materials that can sustain a harsh thermal environment through improved oil cooling. In addition to modify the power output, piston cooling reduces the carbonization and pre-ignition caused by hot spots on sharp edges of the piston crown. In this study, in order to evaluate the piston cooling functionality and validate the numerical simulation, a test rig is designed and manufactured and it is equipped with glassy piston and cylinder to show the oil contact surface. Using this test rig, flow rate is measured in different oil pressures and temperatures. In addition, heat transfer coefficient for various engine speeds is determined. Also a numerical model has been developed using CFD approach for analysis of piston cooling oil jet and validated with existing experimental results at axisymmetric condition. Finally, oil contact area and heat transfer coefficient are predicted {{at the bottom of}} piston for real <b>piston</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>jet</b> conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} the thesis addresses questions of how engine fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions are can be reduced through improvements in thermal management, lubricant design, and energy recovery. The investigations are based on simulation studies using computational models and sub-models developed or revised during the work, and results provided by complementary experimental studies carried out by collaborating investigators. The brake thermal efficiency of the internal combustion engines (ICE) used in cars and light duty commercial vehicles is reduced by frictional losses. These losses vary with engine design, lubricant formulation and thermal state. They are most significant when the engine is running cold or partially warm. Over the New European Drive Cycle (NEDC), engine friction losses raise vehicle fuel consumption by several percentage points. A version of the computational model, PROMETS, has been developed and applied in studies of thermal behaviour, friction and engine lubricant to investigate {{the performance of a}} 2. 0 l, I 4 GTDI spark ignition engine and in particular, how these influence fuel consumption over the NEDC. Core parts of PROMETS include a physics-based, empirically calibrated friction model, a cycle averaged description of gas-to-structure heat transfer and a lumped capacity description of thermal behaviour of the engine block and cylinder head. In the thesis, revisions to the description of friction and interactions between friction, local thermal conditions and lubricant are reported. It is shown that the bulk temperature of coolant rather than oil has the stronger influence on friction at the piston-liner interface, whilst bulk oil temperature more strongly influences friction in crankshaft bearings and other lower engine components. However, local oil film temperatures have a direct influence on local friction contribution. To account for this, local values of oil temperature and viscosity are used in describing local friction contributions. Implementation required an oil system model to be developed; an iterative model of the frictional dissipation within the main bearings, and a prediction of <b>piston</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>jet</b> heat transfer coefficients {{have been added to the}} oil circuit. Simulations of a range of scenarios and design changes are presented and analysed in the thesis.

Generally, engines have lower frictional losses at their optimum operating temperature compared to cold engines in their heat up phase.

Interventions to control these heat flows by {{taking into account the}} entire powertrain are referred to as thermal management. In the scope of this work, two complex simulation models were developed with which various thermal management measures were evaluated for a compressor charged 1. 8 l gasoline engine placed in a middle class vehicle.

40|$|The thermal {{behaviour}} of a 2. 4 l {{direct injection}} diesel engine {{has been investigated}} to identify how the fuel consumption penalty associated with operation during warm–up can be minimised. A version of PROMETS (Programme for Modelling Engine Thermal Systems) was developed to support the investigations. The developments improved the representation of thermal-friction conditions in the oil circuit, extended the piston heat transfer sub-model {{to account for the}} effects of <b>piston</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>jets</b> and introduced a main bearing thermal-friction model to predict friction and oil film temperatures. Computational studies were complemented by an experimental investigation of the effectiveness of pre-heating the oil feed to the bearings. Results show that heat transfer from the oil film to the bearings shells and crankshaft journal reduces the benefit in friction savings. Other measures considered were exhaust gas heat recovery, repositioning of the oil main gallery within the block, thermal energy storage, reductions in engine thermal capacity and a novel split-EGR cooler able to cool the EGR gases and heat either the coolant or oil streams. All of the above measures were investigated in isolation, but where appropriate different measures were adopted in conjunction to achieve even greater fuel savings. During warm-up the energy available to raise fluid temperatures is small. As a result, over the New European Drive Cycle, thermal energy storage showed the greatest benefits. Given an available source of thermal energy which can be transferred to the oil over a chosen time, simulations indicate that a higher power input over a shorter period is most beneficial. This reflects the increased sensitivity of oil viscosity to temperature changes at colder temperatures which in turn means that the potential to reduce friction is highest in the first minutes after engine start up but drops rapidly hereafter. Results also show how the balance of energy transfers out of the oil changes as the engine warms up and point to the importance of oil interaction with components in the lower parts of the engine which have a large thermal capacity, such as elements supporting the main bearings, the crankshaft and the lower liner which limit the rate of temperature rise of the oil. A combination of supplementary heat introduction into the oil circuit from a thermal store and an elimination of heat losses from the oil to the lower parts of the engine resulted in a fuel consumption saving close to that achieved by starting the engine fully warm, which equates to around 6 % improvement.

Generic models with fixed and reciprocating moving discs are used in the first stage of this study to investigate the thermal characteristics of the jet impingement. Subsequently, the information that has been acquired from the first stage is used to successfully simulate a full-scale engine and estimate the temperature profile and heat dissipation from the pistons with and without a <b>cooling</b> oil <b>jet.</b> The computational results show that the radial extent of the stagnation region beneath the jet is not uniform as stated in the literature, but {{is a function of the}} radial velocity gradient (Ýu_r) ⁄Ýr in this region.

This thesis presents research on upward pointing oil <b>jets</b> that provide <b>cooling</b> of downward facing heated surfaces. The specific purpose {{of this research is}} to improve understanding of the oil <b>jet</b> <b>cooling</b> of internal combustion engine pistons. In this research, the cooling of heated blocks with flat and concave surfaces was investigated. Temperature measurements were obtained using an array of thermocouples embedded inside the heated blocks. A flash illumination and high resolution CCD camera system was used to observe the liquid jet impingement. Observations identified a 'bell-sheet' flow pattern, jet interference, jet splatter and jet breakup which provided insights into the liquid jet impingement processes normally encountered on downwardfacing surfaces. Bespoke contracting-type nozzles were used to produce the jet flow structure. The data from these nozzles were used to generate new empirical correlations for oil <b>jet</b> <b>cooling</b> of downward-facing flat surfaces and for predicting the size 6 f impingement. The results obtained from these tests were also used for comparison with <b>cooling</b> <b>jets</b> from production automotive <b>piston</b> <b>cooling</b> nozzles. The research has demonstrated that the effectiveness of oil <b>jet</b> <b>cooling</b> can be affected by preheating the oil and varying the injector size to alter the targeted cooling efficiency, and liquid loss due to jet breakup and splatter.
