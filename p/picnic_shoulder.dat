40|$|The {{association}} between G 316 A growth hormone polymorphism and quantitative traits {{was investigated in}} an F 2 population of pigs. Association analyses were performed using a statistical model that included genotype, sex, batch and sex by genotype interaction as fixed effects and sire as random effect. The polymorphism {{was associated with the}} number of right teats (p = 0. 03), heart weight (p = 0. 04), lung weight (p = 0. 05), carcass length determined by the Brazilian carcass classification method (p = 0. 04), <b>picnic</b> <b>shoulder</b> weight (p = 0. 07), jowl weight (p = 0. 01), pH 24 h after slaughtering (p = 0. 03) and drip loss (p = 0. 01). Interaction between genotype and sex was observed for six performance traits. The additive effect was significant (p < 0. 10) for heart weight, jowl weight and pH 24 h after slaughtering. The effect of dominance was significant (p < 0. 05) for number of right teats, heart weight, carcass length, <b>picnic</b> <b>shoulder</b> weight and pH 24 h after slaughtering. This study shows that the growth hormone gene is a potential candidate for investigating the phenotypic variation of quantitative traits in pigs, and suggests its possible application in breeding programs...|$|E
40|$|A fresh intact muscle pork flavor lexicon was {{developed}} by obtaining cuts of pork (pork loins, <b>shoulders,</b> <b>picnics,</b> tenderloins, fresh ham legs, bellies, enhanced picnics and pork chops) from retail grocery stores. Varying cooking temperatures, cooking techniques, and cuts induced differences in flavors and aromas. These cuts were cooked to various internal temperature endpoints (57. 2 ?C, 62. 7 ?C for roasts, 68. 3 ?C, and 79. 4 ?C) utilizing a high temperature cooking method for chops, and roasting and/or braising for whole muscle cuts. Five highly trained panelists identified and defined twenty-four aroma and flavor attributes. Pork identity, brown/roasted, bloody/serumy, metallic, and fat-like flavor aromatics, and astringent feeling factors, and 4 of the 5 basic tastes were most prevalent in samples. Validation of the pork lexicon was performed. Trained panelists evaluated tenderloin medallions, and loin chops, inside ham chops, and shoulder chops cooked to four internal endpoint temperatures (62. 7 ?C, 68. 3 ?C, 73. 8 ?C, and 79. 4 ?C). Pork identity, brown/roasted, fat-like, bloody/serumy, metallic, liver-like, and nutty flavor aromatics, and astringent feeling factors, and sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami basic tastes were present in samples. All attributes but bitter basic taste (P > 0. 05) differed across cuts (P < 0. 05). All samples had moderate levels of pork identity flavor aromatics. Umami basic taste and liver-like, nutty, and fat-like flavor aromatics and astringent feeling factors were barely detectable. Shoulder chops were higher in pork identity and fat-like flavor aromatics and umami basic taste. Inside ham chops were higher in astringent feeling factors and metallic flavor aromatics, and sour and bitter basic tastes. Brown/roasted, bloody/serumy, and metallic flavor aromatics, and astringent feeling factors, and sour and bitter basic tastes differed across internal endpoint temperatures (P < 0. 05). As internal endpoint temperatures increased, brown/roasted flavor aromatics increased, while bloody/serumy flavor aromatics and astringent feeling factors, and sour and bitter basic tastes decreased. Gas chromatography with olfactory sniff ports detected volatile aromatic compounds (n= 157) found in the samples. Stepwise linear regression equations and simple correlation coefficients were calculated. Stepwise equations used 50, 42, 43, 58, 33, 37, 75, 53, and 42 compounds to account for 93, 91, 83, 94, 77, 87, 96, 88, and 83 % of pork identity, brown/roasted, fat-like, bloody/serumy, and metallic flavor aromatics, and astringent feeling factors, and sour, salty, and bitter basic tastes, respectively which determined volatile aroma compounds that may explain variance of trained descriptive attributes. Sulfur-containing compounds, nitrogen-containing compounds, aldehydes, ketones, acids, alkanes, alkenes, furans, pyrazines, and benzenes influenced pork flavor. Aldehydes were quantitatively higher than other compound classes. Aromatic compounds that clustered with treatments and flavor aromatic attributes varied in partial least squares regression biplots, {{with a large number}} of treatments and attributes that clustered with aldehydes and alcohols, and treatments that were cooked to higher internal endpoint temperatures clustered with compounds such as pyrazines and thiazoles...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess factors that can {{influence}} the colour stability of fresh sausage products using a pork patty model system over a typical distribution and display period. Fresh sausage is usually sold in raw; and it should have minimum 7. 5 % meat protein and 9 % total protein. Losses of meat quality were evidenced through the discolouration of meat, depletion of endogenous antioxidant activities, proliferation of spoilage microorganisms, and reduction in the meat redox potential. Both ground pork and fresh pork patties were made from pork <b>picnic</b> <b>shoulder.</b> In the first study, the quality of both ground pork patties and fresh pork sausage patties decreased over time during storage at 4 °C. The fresh sausages contained ingredients that could prolong their shelf life. The activities of these antioxidant enzymes in both ground pork and fresh sausage were depleted by day 5 of the display period. Ground pork, however, had significantly (...|$|E
40|$|It was {{investigated}} {{the association between}} leptin gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) T 2411 C and T 3266 G with carcass traits in F 2 pigs obtained by crossing native Brazilian Piau with commercial sows composed of Landrace, Large White and Pietrain breeds. Association analyses were performed using a statistical model that included genotype, sex, and batch as fixed effects, sire and error as random effects. The T 2411 C SNP was associated with skinless and fatless boston shoulder weight (BSW), backfat thickness at last rib, 6. 5 cm from the midline (P 2), skinless and fatless <b>picnic</b> <b>shoulder</b> weight, and sirloin weight (SLW). The T 3266 G mutation was associated with slaughter age, bacon weight, BSW, midline backfat thickness between last and last but one lumbar vertebra, midline backfat thickness at last rib, P 2 and rib weight. Phenotypic associations were also performed by combining genotypes for both SNPs. Associations with P 2, carcass yield, total boston shoulder weight, and SLW were observed. The results obtained demonstrate that the SNPs analyzed have potential to be explored as markers for carcass composition in pigs...|$|E
40|$|Competition {{in global}} pork markets has {{increased}} as trade barriers have opened {{as a result}} of free trade agreements. Japanese prefer both loin and Boston butt, while Chinese prefer pork offal. Frozen pork has increased in terms of imports into China. Japanese consumers consider pork meat origin along with pork price when making purchase decisions. While the Chinese prefer a strong tasting pork product, South Korean consumers show very strong preferences to pork that is higher in fat. Therefore, South Korean consumers have a higher demand for pork belly and Boston butt. Consequently, the supply and demand of pork in Korea is hardly met, which means that importation of high fat parts is inevitable. In Korea there is lower preference toward low fat parts such as loin, <b>picnic</b> <b>shoulder,</b> and ham. During the economic depression in South Korea there have been observable changes in consumer preferences. There remains steep competition among the pork exporting countries in terms of gaining share in the international pork market. If specific consumer preferences would be considered carefully, there is the possibility {{to increase the amount of}} pork exported to these countries...|$|E
40|$|Ninety-six {{crossbred}} pigs {{of known}} stress-susceptibility genotype {{were used to}} determine effects of a recombinantly-derived analog of porcine somatotropin (rpST) on performance traits, quantitative and qualitative carcass characteristics and leg soundness. Feed consumption was significantly reduced with rpST and feed conversion improved across all genotypes. A treatment x genotype interaction suggested greater rpST-elicited improvement in feed efficiency within stress-negative genotype. Barrows also responded in a differential manner to rpST with a more definitive improvement in feed conversion relative to controls than was observed for treated gilts. Treatment with rpST increased lean accretion and reduced fat deposition of all genotypes as depicted by increased longissimus muscle areas and reduced average backfat thicknesses. Lean, bone and skin weights increased as a percentage of side weight while adipose tissue decreased in carcasses from treated animals. Proximate analysis of dissected lean and adipose tissues revealed increased percent protein and moisture but a reduction in percent lipid associated with rpST-treatment. Trimmed wholesale cuts of the ham, loin, Boston butt and <b>picnic</b> <b>shoulder</b> also increased as a proportion of side carcass weight due to the repartitioning effect of rpST. Qualitative muscle trait measurements of ultimate pH, visual color, reflectance and transmittance values improved markedly within animals of the stress-positive genotype receiving rpST;Front leg structure and movement as well as rear leg movement scores were observed reflecting a less smooth, more choppy stride for rpST-treated animals. Enhanced muscle development within shoulder and ham regions was the primary cause of this reduced mobility. Rear hock angulation and rear toe size did not differ between rpST-treated groups. Higher composite osteochondrosis score in the forelimb of treated animal resulted from greater incidence of joint lesions at the proximal humerus and proximal radius-ulna locations. Osteochondrosis values were similar for the distal humerus and distal radius-ulna and for the composite value generated from the four joint surface evaluations of hind limb;In summary, rpST improved feed:gain and lean:fat ratios within treated animals, had a beneficial effect on several muscle quality characteristics of the stress-positive genotype, and slightly reduced fore- and rear-leg mobility...|$|E
