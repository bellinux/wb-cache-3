40|$|Abstract—A novel {{approach}} for the autonomous virulence adaptation (AVA) of competing populations in a coevolutionary optimization framework is presented. Previous work {{has demonstrated that}} setting an appropriate virulence, v, of populations accelerates coevolutionary optimization by avoiding detrimental periods of disengagement. However, since the likelihood of disengagement varies both between systems and over time, choosing the ideal value of v is problematic. The AVA technique presented here uses a machine learning approach to continuously tune v as system engagement varies. In a simple, abstract domain, AVA is shown to successfully adapt to the most <b>productive</b> <b>values</b> of v. Further experiments, in more complex domains of sorting networks and maze navigation, demonstrate AVA’s efficiency over reduced virulence and the layered Pareto coevolutionary archive.

Conceivably, if one had made such an investment and then produced a derivative work (or perhaps even re-released the work in ipse), he could counter a suit made by the copyright holder by declaring that Congress had unconstitutionally made, ex post facto, a restriction on the previously unrestricted.|$|E
50|$|The WID {{movement}} faced {{a number}} of criticisms; such an approach had {{in some cases the}} unwanted consequence of depicting women as a unit whose claims are conditional on its <b>productive</b> <b>value,</b> associating increased female status with the value of cash income in women’s lives. Furthermore, the WID, although it advocated for greater gender equality, did not tackle the unequal gender relations and roles at the basis of women's exclusion and gender subordination rather than addressing the stereotyped expectations entertained by men. Moreover, the underlying assumption behind the call for the integration of the Third World women with their national economy was that women were not already participating in development, thus downplaying women's roles in household production and informal economic and political activities. The WID was also criticized for its views on the fact that women's status will improve by moving into “productive employment”, implying that the move to the “modern sector” need to be made from the “traditional” sector to achieve self-advancement, further implying that “traditional” work roles often occupied by women in the developing world were inhibiting to self-development.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} design of <b>value</b> <b>productive</b> episodes at the customer/firm boundary. Its purpose is: To provide perspective and help articulate strategies for increasing precision of {{the design of}} interactive marketing and <b>value</b> <b>productive</b> efforts at firm/customer boundaries. Many observers, thinkers and practitioners of marketing and management are: (1) Struggling to comprehend and manage the impact of new IT/media on what they do; and (2) Striving to actively shape the {{development and use of}} these technologies and perceptions of them in marketing and other contexts. Comprehending the impact of technology and striving to shape its 'cause,' the dissertation argues, is largely an act of design. Not design of technology, but rather their use. In this case, their use in <b>value</b> <b>productive</b> episodes at firm / customer boundaries. This dissertation identifies and advances some basic value configuration logics and places the design of <b>value</b> <b>productive</b> episodes in the center of focus, rather than technology, individuals, segments, or structures. Basic value configuration logics are identified and defined. These are value adding, value capturing, value extracting, and value creating. They are collapsed into two strategic dimensions: value generative and value distributive. Using these logics and strategic dimensions, a robust platform for understanding and designing <b>value</b> <b>productive</b> episodes is presented. The design of <b>value</b> <b>productive</b> episodes as a substantive and productive domain of inquiry, and as a methodology of knowledge construction itself, is advanced. Formal and substantive design generation is compared with formal and substantive grounded theory generation. Formal design develops formal principles that can be applied in numerous substantive design exercises. Substantive design tasks are more concrete exercises addressing a specific and often localized context, like that of designing and marketing a particular offering made by a given firm using various customer interfaces. Substantive design domains explored in cases in this dissertation include information intensive services in the energy industry, and others using IT/media as the primary channel of service delivery, like the world-wide-web. Value configuration logics are expanded to explore 'business models' built upon portfolios of value offerings exploiting different value configuration logics...|$|R

50|$|Economies where {{too much}} profit is being {{extracted}} are over-paying {{the owners of}} capital {{at the expense of}} other contributors to a productive economy or industry. Economies and Industries that provide insufficient returns to the owners of capital should find that capital is moved to alternate investments where the return is greater. Profit Efficient economies and industries are paying the minimum profit to owners of capital required to maintain the optimal level and distribution of capital investment. This concept has importance when discussing the relative outcome efficiency of industries such as the US Health Care System which has high customer costs, high government subsidy and yet has relatively poor health outcomes. This industry is said to be profit inefficient as compared to European health care models which have less customer and government inputs and yet better outcomes. The difference appears to be that the level of rent paid to capital investors in the US system is a greater proportion of the overall <b>productive</b> <b>value</b> of the industry. Similar observations are made about the US Financial System's impact on the US economy as a whole. The increasingly profit inefficient US economy is the primary reason for its rapid decline as an economic superpower.|$|E
50|$|Human {{capital in}} the form of {{education}} shares many characteristics with physical capital. Both require an investment to create and, once created, both have economic value. Physical capital earns a return because people are willing to pay to use a piece of physical capital in work as it allows them to produce more output. To measure the <b>productive</b> <b>value</b> of physical capital, we can simply measure how much of a return it commands in the market. In the case of human capital calculating returns is more complicated - after all, we cannot separate education from the person to see how much it rents for.To get around this problem, the returns to human capital are generally inferred from differences in wages among people with different levels of education. Hall and Jones have calculated from international data that on average that the returns on education are 13.4% per year for first four years of schooling (grades 1-4), 10.1% per year {{for the next four years}} (grades 5-8) and 6.8% for each year beyond eight years. Thus someone with 12 years of schooling can be expected to earn, on average, 1.1344 × 1.1014 × 1.0684 = 3.161 times as much as someone with no schooling at all.|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} {{domestication}} of tree crops {{has only been}} given limited attention. This process starts with the protection of natural forests and ends with the cultivation of domesticated tree crops. In this evolutionary process three types of human-influenced forest environments may be distinguished: (1) conserved forests, (2) modified forests, and (3) transformed forests. During the process of domestication an increasing input of human energy per unit of exploited forest takes place. Accordingly three phases in the domestication of forests may be distinguished: (1) an acculturalization phase in which social measures aimed at controlling the utilization of valuable tree species or patches of forests are implemented, (2) a phase of manipulation of wild tree species in which the socially-oriented management practices are enhanced with measures aimed at enhancing the (re) <b>productive</b> potential of <b>valued</b> species, and (3) a phase of cultivation of genetically modified tree crops. As {{a result of the}} co-domestication of forests and trees various types of forests and/or tree cultivation systems can be distinguished. So far more attention has been given to understanding the characteristics of the early and end phases than to the various intermediate phases represented by indigenous forest management and agroforestry systems. These are characterized by a modification of the highly diverse natural forest ecosystems to a state in which the biodiversity has been somewhat reduced, but in which a larger proportion of useful resources are present. Such systems provide interesting examples of the wide range of options for managing forest resources with varying degrees of biodiversity and <b>productive</b> <b>values...</b>|$|R

Even in Developed Countries and wealthy democracies such as the United States there is concern of gender inequities in economic mobility for women. American President Barack Obama's Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was passed in response to concerns among Americans that women were receiving lower wages for equal work. Wages and wage equality with men are two common indicators of gender equality and opportunity within a formal market. Higher aggregate wages indicate that females are holding more <b>productive,</b> <b>valued</b> jobs which is considered indicative of social progress. Equal pay with men demonstrates a neutrality to gender within the workplace and may suggest functional fairness between female workers [...] and their male counterparts.
