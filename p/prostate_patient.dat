40|$|Abstract Background Although {{treatment}} regimen have improved {{in the last}} few years, <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>patients</b> following a radical prostatectomy still experience severe disease- and treatment-related side effects, including urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction and psychological issues. Despite high incidence rates and the common adverse effects {{there is a lack of}} supportive measures for male patients and specific physical exercise recommendations for <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>patients</b> during rehabilitation or in the aftercare are still missing. Methods/Design The ProRehab Project aims to establish rehabilitative sports groups particularly for <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>patients</b> and to evaluate the effects of the offered exercise program. Starting 8 â€“ 12 [*]weeks after prostatectomy or combination therapy, <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>patients</b> will exercise for 15 [*]months within a patient preference randomized controlled trial. One exercise session will be conducted within a pre-established rehabilitative sports group, while the other will be completed independently. Patients in the control group will not participate in the intervention. The main outcomes of the study include aerobic fitness, quality of life, incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Discussion By combining science, practice, and public relations the first rehabilitative sports groups for <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>patients</b> in Germany have been set up and thus contribute to the care structure for <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>patients.</b> By offering a 15 -month physical exercise intervention that is conducted in supervised group sessions, long-term lifestyle changes and therefore improvements in quality of life in <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>patients</b> can be expected.

40|$|Because of the {{increase}} in <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>patients,</b> urologists can detect more clinically localized <b>prostate</b> cancer in <b>patients</b> before the disease has progressed to advanced stages. Nevertheless, some patients are still diagnosed with high-risk prostate cancer. Even though several treatment options are available for high-risk <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>patients,</b> including radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy, and hormone therapy, used alone or in combination, the recurrence rate is high regardless of the type of treatment. Nevertheless, in the experience of many urologists, a substantial proportion of high-risk <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>patients</b> are cured by local definite therapy or multimodality treatment. Thus, several treatment combinations have been attempted as treatments in these patients. Among them, radical prostatectomy is regarded as the first step in high-risk <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>patients,</b> on a selective basis. In some high-risk <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>patients,</b> surgery is a one-step modality in treatment and has an excellent oncological prognosis.

The benefit of PT has been shown for a number of tumour sites, particularly for paediatric patients. The workload from these patients may not completely fill the maximum yearly workload of a machine. This work aims to ascertain if prostate cancer would be a suitable candidate to fill the rest of the workload at an Australian PT facility. Passive and intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) plans were generated for a <b>prostate</b> <b>patient.</b> These were compared to 7 field sliding window and step and shoot IMRT plans. All plans used a prescription dose of 78 CGE. IMRT and IMPT plans used inverse planning for optimisation. Homogeneity in the PTV was best for the IMPT plan. IMPT also gave the best rectal sparing. The bladder and femoral heads were exposed to less dose in both proton plans. Proton plans exposed normal tissue outside the PTV to less than 50 % of the dose given by the IMRT plans.

40|$|An intensity-modulated {{radiation}} therapy (IMRT) field {{is composed of}} a series of segmented beams. It is practically important {{to reduce the number of}} segments while maintaining the conformality of the final dose distribution. In this article, the authors quantify the complexity of an IMRT fluence map by introducing the concept of sparsity of fluence maps and formulate the inverse planning problem into a framework of compressing sensing. In this approach, the treatment planning is modeled as a multiobjective optimization problem, with one objective on the dose performance and the other on the sparsity of the resultant fluence maps. A Pareto frontier is calculated, and the achieved dose distributions associated with the Pareto efficient points are evaluated using clinical acceptance criteria. The clinically acceptable dose distribution with the smallest number of segments is chosen as the final solution. The method is demonstrated in the application of fixed-gantry IMRT on a <b>prostate</b> <b>patient.</b> The result shows that the total number of segments is greatly reduced while a satisfactory dose distribution is still achieved. With the focus on the sparsity of the optimal solution, the proposed method is distinct from the existing beamlet- or segment-based optimization algorithms...|$|E
40|$|Cells {{respond to}} {{genotoxic}} insults such as ionizing radiation by halting in the G(2) {{phase of the}} cell cycle. Delayed cell death (mitotic death) can occur when the cell is released from G(2), and specific spindle defects form endopolyploid cells (endoreduplication/tetraploidy). Enhanced G(2) chromosomal radiosensitivity has been observed in many cancers and genomic instability syndromes, and it is manifested by radiation-induced chromatid aberrations observed in lymphocytes of patients. Here we compare the G(2) chromosomal radiosensitivity in <b>prostate</b> <b>patients</b> with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or prostate cancer with disease-free controls. We also investigated {{whether there is a}} correlation between G(2) chromosomal radiosensitivity and aneuploidy (tetraploidy and endoreduplication), which are indicative of mitotic cell death. The G(2) assay was carried out on all human blood samples. Metaphase analysis was conducted on the harvested chromosomes by counting the number of aberrations and the mitotic errors (endoreduplication/tetraploidy) separately per 100 metaphases. A total of 1 / 14 of the controls were radiosensitive in G(2) compared to 6 / 15 of the BPH patients and 15 / 17 of the <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>patients.</b> Radiation-induced mitotic inhibition was assessed to determine the efficacy of G(2) checkpoint control in the <b>prostate</b> <b>patients.</b> There was no significant correlation of G(2) radiosensitivity scores and mitotic inhibition in BPH patients (P = 0. 057), in contrast to <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>patients,</b> who showed a small but significant positive correlation (P = 0. 029). Furthermore, there was no significant correlation between G(2) radiosensitivity scores of BPH patients and endoreduplication/ tetraploidy (P = 0. 136), which contrasted with an extremely significant correlation observed in <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>patients</b> (P < 0. 0001).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Effective {{management}} of chronic {{diseases such as}} prostate cancer is important. Research suggests a tendency to use self-care treatment options such as over-the-counter (OTC) complementary medications among <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>patients.</b> The current trend in patient-driven recording of health data in an online Personal Health Record (PHR) presents an opportunity to develop new data-driven approaches for improving <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>patient</b> care. However, the ability of current online solutions to share patients' data for better decision support is limited. An informatics approach may improve online sharing of self-care interventions among these patients. It can also provide better evidence to support decisions made during their self-managed care. AIMS: To identify requirements for an online system and describe a new case-based reasoning (CBR) method for improving self-care of advanced <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>patients</b> in an online PHR environment.

40|$|Purpose: ToÂ investigate {{the effect}} of {{magnetic}} resonance system- and patient-induced susceptibility distortions from a 3 T scanner on dose distributions for prostate cancers. Methods and Materials: Combined displacement fields from the residual system and patient-induced susceptibility distortions were used to distort 17 <b>prostate</b> <b>patient</b> CT images. VMAT dose plans were initially optimized on distorted CT images and the plan parameters transferred to the original patient CT images to calculate a new dose distribution. Results: Maximum residual mean distortions of 3. 19 Â mm at a radial distance of 25 Â cm and maximum mean patient-induced susceptibility shifts of 5. 8 Â mm were found using the lowest bandwidth of 122 Â Hz per pixel. There was a dose difference of < 0. 5 % between distorted and undistorted treatment plans. The 90 % confidence intervals of the mean difference between the dCT and CT treatment plans were all within an equivalence interval of (âˆ’ 0. 5, 0. 5) for all investigated plan quality measures. Conclusions: Patient-induced susceptibility distortions at high field strengths in closed bore magnetic resonance scanners are larger than residual system distortions after using vendor-supplied 3 -dimensional correction for the delineated regions studied. However, errors in dose due to disturbed patient outline and shifts caused by patient-induced susceptibility effects are below 0. 5 %...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} the optimum energy and beam arrangement for prostate intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) delivery using an Elekta Beam Modulatorâ„¢ linear accelerator, {{in order to}} inform decisions when commissioning IMRT for prostate cancer. MethodsCMS XiO was used to create IMRT plans for a <b>prostate</b> <b>patient.</b> Arrangements with 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 equally spaced fields, containing both a direct anterior and a direct posterior beam were used, with both 6 MV and 10 MV photons. The effects of varying {{the maximum number of}} iterations, leaf increment, number of intensity levels and minimum segment size were investigated. Treatment plans were compared using isodose distributions, conformity indices for targets and critical structures, target dose homogeneity, body dose and plan complexity. ResultsTarget dose conformity and homogeneity and sparing of critical structures improved with an increasing number of beams, although any improvements were small for plans containing more than five fields. Set-ups containing a direct posterior field provided superior conformality around the rectum to anterior beam arrangements. Mean non-target dose and total number of monitor units were higher with 6 MV for all beam arrangements. The dose distribution resulting from seven 6 MV beams was considered clinically equivalent to that with five 10 MV beams. ConclusionMethods have been developed to plan IMRT treatments using XiO for delivery with a Beam Modulatorâ„¢ that fulfil demanding dose criteria, using many different set-ups. This study suggests that 6 MV photons can produce prostate IMRT plans that are comparable to those using 10 MV. Work is ongoing to develop a complete class solution...|$|E
40|$|The fluence exiting {{a patient}} during beam {{delivery}} {{can be used}} as treatment delivery quality assurance, either by direct comparison with expected exit fluences or by backprojection to reconstruct the patient dose. Multiple possible sources of measured exit fluence deviations exist, including changes in the beam delivery and changes in the patient anatomy. The purpose of this work is to compare the deviations caused by these sources. Machine delivery-related variability is measured by acquiring multiple dosimetric portal images (DPIs) of several test fields without a patient/phantom in the field over a time period of 2 months. Patient anatomy-related sources of fluence variability are simulated by computing transmission DPIs for a <b>prostate</b> <b>patient</b> using the same incident fluence for 11 different computed tomography (CT) images of the patient anatomy. The standard deviation (SD) and maximum deviation of the exit fluence, averaged over 5 mm x 5 mm square areas, is calculated for each test set. Machine delivery fluence SDs as large as 1 % are observed for a sample patient field and as large as 2. 5 % for a picket-fence dMLC test field. Simulations indicate that day-to-day patient anatomy variations induce exit fluence SDs as large as 3. 5 %. The largest observed machine delivery deviations are 4 % for the sample patient field and 7 % for the picket-fence field, while the largest difference for the patient anatomy-related source is 8. 5 %. Since daily changes in patient anatomy can result in substantial exit fluence deviations, care should be taken when applying fluence back-projection to ensure that such deviations are properly attributed to their source...|$|E

40|$|Image {{segmentation}} and delineation is at {{the heart}} of modern radiotherapy, where the aim is to deliver as high a radiation dose as possible to a cancerous target whilst sparing the surrounding healthy tissues. This, of course, requires that a radiation oncologist dictates both where the tumour and any nearby critical organs are located. As well as in treatment planning, delineation is of vital importance in image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) : organ motion studies demand that features across image databases are accurately segmented, whilst if on-line adaptive IGRT is to become a reality, speedy and correct target identification is a necessity. Recently, much work has been put into the development of automatic and semi-automatic segmentation tools, often using prior knowledge to constrain some grey level, or derivative thereof, interrogation algorithm. It is hoped that such techniques can be applied to organ at risk and tumour segmentation in radiotherapy. In this work, however, we make the assumption that grey levels do not necessarily determine a tumourâ€™s extent, especially in CT where the attenuation coefficient can often vary little between cancerous and normal tissue. In this context we present an algorithm that generates a discontinuity free delineation surface driven by user placed, evidence based support points. In regions of sparse user supplied information, prior knowledge, in the form of a statistical shape model, provides guidance. A small case study is used to illustrate the method.

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: To {{assess the}} accuracy, reproducibility, and {{computational}} performance of deformable image registration algorithms under development at multiple institutions on common datasets. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Datasets from a lung patient (four-dimensional computed tomography [4 D-CT]), a liver patient (4 D-CT and {{magnetic resonance imaging}} [MRI] at exhale), and a <b>prostate</b> <b>patient</b> (repeat MRI) were obtained. Radiation oncologists localized anatomic structures for accuracy assessment. Algorithm accuracy was determined by comparing the computer-predicted displacement at each bifurcation point with the displacement computed from the oncologists' annotations. Thirty-seven academic institutions and medical device manufacturers with published evidence of active deformable image registration capabilities were invited to participate. RESULTS: Twenty-seven groups agreed to participate; 6 did not return results. Sixteen completed the liver 4 D-CT, 12 the lung 4 D-CT, 3 the prostate MRI, and 3 the liver MRI-CT. The range of average absolute error for the lung 4 D-CT was 0. 6 - 1. 2 mm (left-right [LR]), 0. 5 - 1. 8 mm (anterior-posterior [AP]), and 0. 7 - 2. 0 mm (superior-inferior [SI]); the liver 4 D-CT was 0. 8 - 1. 5 mm (LR), 1. 0 - 5. 2 mm (AP), and 1. 0 - 5. 9 mm (SI); the liver MRI-CT was 1. 1 - 2. 6 mm (LR), 2. 0 - 5. 0 mm (AP), and 2. 2 - 2. 6 mm (SI); and the repeat prostate MRI prostate datasets was 0. 5 - 6. 2 mm (LR), 3. 1 - 3. 7 mm (AP), and 0. 4 - 2. 0 mm (SI).

40|$|Planning {{intensity}} modulated {{radiation therapy}} (IMRT) treatment involves selection of several angle parameters {{as well as}} specification of structures and constraints employed in the optimization process. Including these parameters in the combinatorial search space vastly increases the computational burden, and therefore the parameter selection is normally performed manually by a clinician, based on clinical experience. We have investigated {{the use of a}} genetic algorithm (GA) and distributed-computing platform to optimize the gantry angle parameters and provide insight into additional structures, which may be necessary, in the dose optimization process to produce optimal IMRT treatment plans. For an IMRT <b>prostate</b> <b>patient,</b> we produced the first generation of 40 samples, each of five gantry angles, by selecting from a uniform random distribution, subject to certain adjacency and opposition constraints. Dose optimization was performed by distributing the 40 -plan workload over several machines running a commercial treatment planning system. A score was assigned to each resulting plan, based on how well it satisfied clinically-relevant constraints. The second generation of 40 samples was produced by combining the highest-scoring samples using techniques of crossover and mutation. The process was repeated until the sixth generation, and the results compared with a clinical (equally-spaced) gantry angle configuration. In the sixth generation, 34 of the 40 GA samples achieved better scores than the clinical plan, with the best plan showing an improvement of 84 %. Moreover, the resulting configuration of beam angles tended to cluster toward the patient's sides, indicating where the inclusion of additional structures in the dose optimization process may avoid dose hot spots. Additional parameter selection in IMRT leads to a large-scale computational problem. We have demonstrated that the GA combined with a distributed-computing platform can be applied to optimize gantry angle selection within a reasonable amount of time...|$|E

This work aims {{to develop a new}} method for gantry-angle-resolved {{verification of}} VMAT dose delivery using EPID. Methods: An EPID dose prediction model was used to calculate EPID images as a function of gantry angle for eight <b>prostate</b> <b>patient</b> deliveries. EPID image frames at 7. 5 frames per second were acquired during delivery via a frame-grabber system. The gantry angle for each image was encoded in kV frames which were synchronized to the MV frames. Gamma analysis results as a function of gantry angle were assessed by integrating the frames over 2 Â° subarcs with an angle-to-agreement tolerance of 0. 5 Â° about the measured image angle. Results: The model agreed with EPID images integrated over the entire delivery with average Gamma pass-rates at 2 %, 2 mm of 99. 7 % (10 % threshold). The accuracy of the kV derived gantry angle for each image was found to be 0. 1 Â° (1 SD) using a phantom test. For the gantry-resolved analysis all Gamma pass-rates were greater than 90 % at 3 %, 3 mm criteria (with only two exceptions), and more than 90 % had a 95 % pass-rate, with an average of 97. 3 %. The measured gantry angle lagged behind the predicted angle by a mean of 0. 3 Â° Â± 0. 3 Â°, with a maximum lag of 1. 3 Â°.

40|$|Monte Carlo (MC) {{simulation}} {{is considered}} {{as the most}} accurate method for radiation dose calculations. Accuracy of a source model for a linear accelerator is critical for the overall dose calculation accuracy. In this paper, we presented an analytical source model that we recently developed for GPU-based MC dose calculations. A key concept called phase-space-ring (PSR) was proposed. It contained a group of particles that are of the same type and close in energy and radial distance {{to the center of}} the phase-space plane. The model parameterized probability densities of particle location, direction and energy for each primary photon PSR, scattered photon PSR and electron PSR. For a primary photon PSRs, the particle direction is assumed to be from the beam spot. A finite spot size is modeled with a 2 D Gaussian distribution. For a scattered photon PSR, multiple Gaussian components were used to model the particle direction. The direction distribution of an electron PSRs was also modeled as a 2 D Gaussian distribution with a large standard deviation. We also developed a method to analyze a phase-space file and derive corresponding model parameters. To test the accuracy of our linac source model, dose distributions of different open fields in a water phantom were calculated using our source model and compared to those directly calculated using the reference phase-space file. The average distance-to-agreement (DTA) was within 1 mm for the depth dose in the build-up region and beam penumbra regions. The root-mean-square (RMS) dose difference was within 1. 1 % for dose profiles at inner and outer beam regions. The maximal relative difference of output factors was within 0. 5 %. Good agreements were also found in an IMRT <b>prostate</b> <b>patient</b> case and an IMRT head-and-neck case.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{incorporate}} the dosimetric effect of random patient positioning uncertainties directly into a commercial treatment planning systemâ€™s IMRT plan optimization algorithm through probabilistic treatment planning (PTP) and compare coverage of this method with margin-based planning. In this work, PTP eliminates explicit margins and optimizes directly on the estimated integral treatment dose to determine optimal patient dose in the presence of setup uncertainties. Twenty-eight <b>prostate</b> <b>patient</b> plans adhering to the RTOG- 0126 criteria are optimized using both margin-based and PTP methods. Only random errors are considered. For margin-based plans, the planning target volume is created by expanding the clinical target volume (CTV) by 2. 1 mm to accommodate the simulated 3 mm random setup uncertainty. Random setup uncertainties are incorporated into IMRT dose evaluation by convolving each beamâ€™s incident fluence with a Ïƒ= 3 mm Gaussian prior to dose calculation. PTP optimization uses the convolved fluence to estimate dose to ensure CTV coverage during plan optimization. PTP-based plans are compared to margin-based plans with equal CTV coverage in the presence of setup errors based on dose-volume metrics. The sensitivity of the optimized plans to patient-specific setup uncertainty variations is assessed by evaluating dose metrics for dose distributions corresponding to halving and doubling of the random setup uncertainty used in the optimization. Margin-based and PTP-based plans show similar target coverage. A physician review shows that PTP is preferred for 21 patients, margin-based plans are preferred in 2 patients, no preference is expressed for 1 patient, and both autogenerated plans are rejected for 4 patients. For the PTP-based plans, the average CTV receiving the prescription dose decreases by 0. 5 %, while the mean dose to the CTV increases by 0. 7 %. The CTV tumor control probability (TCP) is the same for both methods with the exception of one case in which PTP gave a slightly higher TCP. For critical structures that do not meet the optimization criteria, PTP shows a decrease in the volume receiving the maximum specified dose. PTP reduces local normal tissue volumes receiving the maximum dose on average by 48 %. PTP results in lower mean dose to all critical structures for all plans. PTP results in a 2. 5 % increase in the probability of uncomplicated control (P+), along with a 1. 9 % reduction in rectum normal tissue complication probability (NTCP), and a 0. 7 % reduction in bladder NTCP. PTP-based plans show improved conformality as compared with margin-based plans with an average PTP-based dosimetric margin at 7100 cGy of 0. 65 cm compared with the margin-based 0. 90 cm and a PTP-based dosimetric margin at 3960 cGy of 1. 60 cm compared with the margin-based 1. 90 cm. PTP-based plans show similar sensitivity to variations of the uncertainty during treatment from the uncertainty used in planning as compared to margin-based plans. For equal target coverage, when compared to margin-based plans, PTP results in equal or lower doses to normal structures. PTP results in more conformal plans than margin-based plans and shows similar sensitivity to variations in uncertainty...|$|E

BM and IM registration algorithms â€“ based on maximization of mutual information of bony anatomy only and the entire image, respectively â€“ were used to independently register MVCT images to their respective planning images. A correlation coefficient based algorithm that uses known planning CT contour information was used for automatic prostate localization in each MVCT image. Daily prostate misplacement was determine...|$|R
40|$|Digital tomosynthesis (DTS) is a quasi-three-dimensional (3 D) imaging {{technique}} which reconstructs images from a limited angle of cone-beam projections with shorter acquisition time, lower imaging dose, and less mechanical constraint than full cone-beam CT (CBCT). However, DTS images reconstructed by the conventional filtered back projection method have low plane-to-plane resolution, {{and they do}} not provide full volumetric information for target localization due to the limited angle of the DTS acquisition. This dissertation presents the optimization and clinical implementation of image guided radiation therapy using limited-angle projections. A hybrid multiresolution rigid-body registration technique was developed to automatically register reference DTS images with on-board DTS images to guide patient positioning in radiation therapy. This hybrid registration technique uses a faster but less accurate static method to achieve an initial registration, followed by a slower but more accurate adaptive method to fine tune the registration. A multiresolution scheme is employed in the registration to further improve the registration accuracy, robustness and efficiency. Normalized mutual information is selected as the criterion for the similarity measure, and the downhill simplex method is used as the search engine. This technique was tested using image data both from an anthropomorphic chest phantom and from head-and-neck cancer patients. The effects of the scan angle and the region-of-interest size on the registration accuracy and robustness were investigated. The average capture ranges in single-axis simulations with a 44 Â° scan angle and a large ROI covering the entire DTS volume were between - 31 and + 34 deg for rotations and between - 89 and + 78 mm for translations in the phantom study, and between - 38 and + 38 deg for rotations and between - 58 and + 65 mm for translations in the patient study. Additionally, a novel limited-angle CBCT estimation method using a deformation field map was developed to optimally estimate volumetric information of organ deformation for soft tissue alignment in image guided radiation therapy. The deformation field map is solved by using prior information, a deformation model, and new projection data. Patients' previous CBCT data are used as the prior information, and the new patient volume to be estimated is considered as a deformation of the prior patient volume. The deformation field is solved by minimizing bending energy and maintaining new projection data fidelity using a nonlinear conjugate gradient method. The new patient CBCT volume is then obtained by deforming the prior patient CBCT volume according to the solution to the deformation field. The method was tested for different scan angles in 2 D and 3 D cases using simulated and real projections of a Shepp-Logan phantom, liver, prostate and head-and-neck patient data. Hardware acceleration and multiresolution scheme are used to accelerate the 3 D estimation process. The accuracy of the estimation was evaluated by comparing organ volume, similarity and pixel value differences between limited-angle CBCT and full-rotation CBCT images. Results showed that the respiratory motion in the liver patient, rectum volume change in the <b>prostate</b> <b>patient,</b> and the weight loss and airway volume change in the head-and-neck patient were accurately estimated in the 60 Â° CBCT images. This new estimation method is able to optimally estimate the volumetric information using 60 -degree projection images. It is both technically and clinically feasible for image-guidance in radiation therapy. Dissertatio...|$|E
40|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} the second cause of cancer in males. The {{prophylactic}} pelvic irradiation is usually needed for treating <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>patients</b> with Subclinical Nodal Metestases. Currently, the physi- cians decide when to deliver pelvic irradiation in nodal negative patients mainly by using the Roach formula, which gives an approximate estima- tion {{of the risk of}} Subclinical Nodal Metestases. In this paper we study the exploitation of Machine Learning techniques for training models, based on several pre-treatment parameters, {{that can be used for}} predicting the nodal status of <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>patients.</b> An experimental retrospective analysis, conducted on the largest Italian database of <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>patients</b> treated with radical External Beam Radiation Therapy, shows that the proposed approaches can effectively predict the nodal status of patients...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the use of {{complementary}} therapies (CT) among breast and <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>patients</b> during active cancer treatment. The authors compared use and beliefs about the role of CT in cancer re-covery. Methods: A self-report survey was completed by 126 breast cancer <b>patients</b> and 82 <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>patients</b> as part of a multisite research project. The self-report question-naire inquired about the use of various CTs, sources of in-formation about CT, reasons for using CT, beliefs about the benefits and risks of CT, demographic characteristics, and cancer treatment history. Results: Most of the respondents were older than 50 years, Caucasian, married, had attended or completed college, and were less than 1 year postdiagnosis. <b>Prostate</b> cancer <b>patients</b> were significantly older than the breast cancer patients (P <. 001). Several dif-ferences emerged between the groups. Compared to the <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>patients,</b> significantly more of the breast cancer patients reported using CT because they wanted to reduce the risk of recurrence (P <. 01), play a more active role in recovery (P <. 01), help manage stress (P <. 01), take a more holistic approach (P <. 01), or boost the immune sys-tem (P <. 01). More of the <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>patients</b> reported using CT to have more control of their recovery (P <. 05). The 2 groups also differed significantly (P <. 01) on several beliefs about the potential benefits and risks of using CT. Conclusions: Most of the patients in this study had used some form of CT since the time of their diagnosis. Differences among breast and <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>patients</b> with regard to their use of CT during cancer treatment should be considered by oncology professionals who are discussing this topic with their patients...|$|R
40|$|Background. Taiwanâ€™s National Health Insurance (NHI) is a {{comprehensive}} and universal program, providing Western medicine (WM) and Chinese medicine (CM). This study aims to explore CM use among <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>patients</b> in NHI. Methods. A cross-section retrospective analysis was conducted using registration and claim data sets from the NHI Research Database. In 2007, 22 352 <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>patients</b> with 265 497 visits of CM and WM ambulatory services were identified. Patient demographics, patterns of therapies, and costs were analyzed. Results. In 2007, 592 <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>patients</b> (2. 6 %) had 4141 CM outpatient visits (7. 0 on average). The median age was 73. 9. The majority (90. 5 %) of CM users also used WM ambulatory services. About one third of CM outpatient services were provided by private clinics. The most frequently used CM therapies were Chinese herbal medication (93. 6 %), followed by acupuncture/traumatology manipulative therapies (7. 0 %). CM accounted for 0. 2 % expenditure ($ 87 500) and 1. 6 % visits of ambulatory services. The average cost per visit for WM was 6. 3 times higher than that for CM ($ 133. 6 vs $ 21). Conclusions. The prevalence and costs of insurance-covered CM among <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>patients</b> were low. Most <b>prostate</b> cancer <b>patients</b> did not use insurance-covered CM. The majority of CM users also used WM. CM appeared to play a complementary rather than an alternative role...|$|R
