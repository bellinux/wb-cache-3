40|$|Pont and Koenderink {{discuss the}} {{complexity}} of reflectance in real-world circumstances. Current reflectance models assume glossy surfaces, and, consequently, are able to represent their reflectance by a linear combination of specular and diffuse reflectance functions. The paper starts with a thorough overview of research done on reflectance distribution functions. Next, the authors present their photographs of three physical objects: one painted with matte white paint, one painted with glossy white paint, and a polished black plastic model. Since diffuse illumination was used, a direct comparison was possible. A visual analysis was done to obtain some intuitive understanding of the problems present with the reflectance of rough surfaces. To {{determine the influence of}} the differences in texture between the models, a semi-quantitative analysis was conducted. The authors start with these assumptions: material scatters light via body scattering and surface scattering, and, for each type of scattering, there is a certain probability that each type of scattering will occur. The total reflectance is then a linear combination of the latter probabilities. Using an approximation of the reflectance of objects, the authors were able to calculate the radiant power of first- and higher-order reflections of each of the models. Their results demonstrated that linear superpositions of textures of locally specular <b>pitted</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and of locally diffuse <b>pitted</b> <b>surfaces,</b> differ substantially from the texture of glossy <b>pitted</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Realistic reflectance models should take the photometrical effect of multiple reflections into account, except in the case of perfectly smooth convex dielectrics...|$|R

500|$|The {{relief is}} a {{terracotta}} (fired clay) plaque, [...] large, [...] thick, {{with the head}} of the figure projecting [...] from the surface. To manufacture the relief, clay with small calcareous inclusions was mixed with chaff; visible folds and fissures suggest the material was quite stiff when being worked. The British Museum's Department of Scientific Research reports, [...] "it would seem likely that the whole plaque was moulded" [...] with subsequent modelling of some details and addition of others, such as the rod-and-ring symbols, the tresses of hair and the eyes of the owls. The relief was then burnished and polished, and further details were incised with a pointed tool. Firing burned out the chaff, leaving characteristic voids and the <b>pitted</b> <b>surface</b> we see now; Curtis and Collon believe the surface would have appeared smoothed by ochre paint in antiquity.|$|E

The fruit bodies of P.calongei start out appearing similar to whitish [...] "eggs", with a membranous exoperidium (outer tissue layer) and gelatinous, translucent endoperidium (inner tissue layer). The fully expanded fruit body consists of a single, thick, stalk with a ridged and pitted cap attached to the apex; the cap is covered with olive-green, slimy gleba. The fruit body can reach up to [...] tall and [...] thick. It is whitish and hollow, slightly tapered at both ends, and has a wall that consists of layers of perforated chambers. At the apex of the stalk is the [...] "cap", which can be up to [...] high and [...] thick. It is bell-shaped to conical- with a <b>pitted</b> <b>surface.</b> As the gleba dissipates, the cap surface becomes strongly reticulated—forming a network of raised pinkish ridges.

2500|$|A {{variety of}} {{finishes}} {{can be applied}} to dimension stone to achieve diverse architectural and aesthetic effects. [...] These finishes include, but are not limited to, the following. [...] A polished finish gives the surface a high luster and strong reflection of incident light (almost mirror-like). [...] A honed finish provides a smooth, satin-like ("eggshell"), nonreflective surface. [...] More textured finishes include brush-hammered, sandblasted, and thermal. [...] A brush-hammered finish, similar to a houndstooth pattern, creates a rough, but uniformly patterned surface with impact tools varying in coarseness. [...] A sandblasted surface provides an irregular <b>pitted</b> <b>surface</b> by impacting sand or metal particles at high velocity against a stone surface. [...] A thermal (or flamed) finish produces a textured, nonreflective surface with only a few reflections from cleavage faces, by applying a high-temperature flame. [...] This finish may change the natural color of the stone depending on mineralogical composition, particularly with stones containing higher levels of iron.|$|E

2500|$|Unger’s {{subsequent}} {{solo exhibition}} at the Trans Hudson Gallery in 1997 featured five sculptures that display her strong interest in organic forms. [...] Shanks consists of three nine-foot vertical bony shafts, each with a rounded point {{on the floor and}} topped with a bulbous knob. [...] Two knobs, imitating the ball of a ball-and-socket joint, protrude just above the middle of each shaft. [...] The white hydrocal was roughly scarred to give the appearance of bone. [...] One critic got the impression that the sculpture was the leg bone of some huge prehistoric animal. [...] Another believed the sculptures were like stern goddesses gazing down on their followers. [...] The sculpture exemplified Unger’s inclinations – rational yet connected to nature, serene but passionate, rigorously formed yet playful. [...] Unger also included a wall-mounted sculpture titled Black Heart, a darkly poetic version of a heart that hovers without apparent support. [...] Its black scorched and <b>pitted</b> <b>surface</b> looks like damaged skin over muscle. [...] Its mythic presence is in line with the symbolism of the origin of emotion. [...] It suggests that life processes are just as metaphysical as they are scientific.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the ammonia emissions from houses for growing-finishing pigs with an outside yard. While regular emission measurements are not possible in these open systems another approach was used. Local parameters were measured and used in an existing NH 3 emission model to calculate the ammonia emissions. The following local parameters were measured/determined: total urine fouled floor area, total manure area in the manure <b>pit,</b> <b>surface</b> temperature of fouled areas of floor and manure pit, air velocity above fouled floor areas. Parameters pH and NH 4 -N content were measured by filter absorption of the urine puddles on the floor and the upper layer of the manure in the pit. These measurements were done in 3 pig houses with outside yard and in 2 regular houses, serving as reference. From the results of this study the following was concluded: 1) The floor emission is generally higher in houses with outside yard compared with regular houses, mainly caused by a larger fouled floor area. 2) The emission per m 2 <b>pit</b> <b>surface</b> area is significantly lower in houses with outside yard, especially as a result of the lower surface temperature of the manure in the pit. 3) The determination of ammonia emission in houses with outside yards using locally measured parameters provides a clear methodological perspective. Further validation of this method, however, is necessary. Particular attention should be given to what happens in the upper layer of the manure...|$|R
