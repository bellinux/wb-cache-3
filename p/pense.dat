5|$|Edward III {{founded the}} Order of the Garter in about 1348. Since then, the full {{achievement}} of the Royal Arms has included {{a representation of the}} Garter, encircling the shield. This is a blue circlet with gold buckle and edging, bearing the order's Old French motto Honi soit qui mal y <b>pense</b> ("Shame be to him who thinks evil of it") in gold capital letters.|$|E
5|$|Central to Edward III's {{policy was}} {{reliance}} on the higher nobility for purposes of war and administration. While his father had regularly been in conflict with a great portion of his peerage, Edward III successfully created a spirit of camaraderie between himself and his greatest subjects. Both Edward I and Edward II had been limited in their policy towards the nobility, allowing the creation of few new peerages during the sixty years preceding Edward III's reign. The young king reversed this trend when, in 1337, as a preparation for the imminent war, he created six new earls on the same day. At the same time, Edward expanded {{the ranks of the}} peerage upwards, by introducing the new title of duke for close relatives of the king. Furthermore, Edward bolstered the sense of community within this group by the creation of the Order of the Garter, probably in 1348. A plan from 1344 to revive the Round Table of King Arthur never came to fruition, but the new order carried connotations from this legend by the circular shape of the garter. Edward's wartime experiences during the Crécy campaign (1346–7) seem to have been a determining factor in his abandonment of the Round Table project. It has been argued that the total warfare tactics employed by the English at Crécy in 1346 were contrary to Arthurian ideals and made Arthur a problematic paradigm for Edward III, especially {{at the time of the}} institution of the Garter. There are no formal references to King Arthur and the Round Table in the surviving early fifteenth-century copies of the Statutes of the Garter, but the Garter Feast of 1358 did involve a round table game. Thus there was some overlap between the projected Round Table fellowship and the actualized Order of the Garter. Polydore Vergil tells of how the young Joan of Kent, Countess of Salisbury – allegedly the king's favourite at the time – accidentally dropped her garter at a ball at Calais. King Edward responded to the ensuing ridicule of the crowd by tying the garter around his own knee with the words honi soit qui mal y <b>pense</b> – shame on him who thinks ill of it.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{motto of}} the RAE, adopted at Federation was Facimus et Frangimus (We make and we break) and {{appeared on the}} engineer hat badge up until 1947 when it was replaced by Honi soit qui mal y <b>pense.</b> It now only appears on the Corps Cipher.|$|E

Since then <b>Penser</b> has rebuilt an estimated net worth of SEK 1 billion, with interests in both Sweden and abroad.

50|$|During the 1980s <b>Penser</b> {{was one of}} Sweden's most {{influential}} businessmen. Through his holding company, Yggdrasil, he controlled both Nobel Industrier and Finans AB Gamlestaden. His massive financial leverage and the harsh business environment experienced during the Swedish banking crisis in 1990-1994 forced <b>Penser</b> to cease control of his holdings, which were sold to Nordbanken (which became Nordea) for the symbolic sum of SEK 1 each. At a press conference Björn Wahlström, the chairman of Nordbanken, said that Erik <b>Penser</b> was 'destitute and finished as a businessman'. The transaction resulted in a prolonged legal dispute between <b>Penser</b> and Nordbanken.|$|R

25|$|The {{addition}} by King Charles of Nemo me impune lacessit {{ensured that}} the blazon of his Royal arms used in Scotland complemented that of his Royal arms used elsewhere, in that two mottoes were displayed. The blazon used elsewhere had included the French motto of the arms, Dieu et mon droit, together with the Old French motto of the Order of the Garter, the highest Chivalric order of the Kingdom of England. The motto of the Order of the Garter, Honi soit qui mal y <b>pense,</b> appears on {{a representation of the}} garter surrounding the shield. Henceforth, the versions of the Royal arms used in Scotland and elsewhere were to include both the motto of the arms of the respective kingdom and the motto of the associated order of chivalry.|$|E
25|$|In the {{standard}} variant used outside of Scotland, the shield is quartered, depicting {{in the first}} and fourth quarters the three passant guardant lions of England; in the second, the rampant lion and double tressure flory-counterflory of Scotland; and in the third, a harp for Ireland. The crest is a statant guardant lion wearing the St Edward's Crown, himself on another representation of that crown. The dexter supporter is a likewise crowned English lion; the sinister, a Scottish unicorn. According to legend a free unicorn was considered a very dangerous beast; therefore the heraldic unicorn is chained, as were both supporting unicorns in the royal coat of arms of Scotland. In the greenery below, a thistle, Tudor rose and shamrock are depicted, representing Scotland, England and Ireland respectively. This armorial achievement comprises the motto of English monarchs, Dieu et mon Droit (God and my Right), which has descended to the present royal family as well as the Garter circlet which surrounds the shield, inscribed with the Order's motto, Honi soit qui mal y <b>pense</b> (Shame on he who thinks evil).|$|E
25|$|All {{the later}} Commission tablets used {{a design that}} {{differed}} from the prototype tablet in that it brought together elements from all the dominions and India. This standard design, following consultations with the College of Arms, had the Royal Coat of Arms surrounded by the shields of the coats of arms of the five Dominions: the Union of South Africa, the Commonwealth of Australia, the Dominion of New Zealand, the Dominion of Canada and the Dominion of Newfoundland. The Indian Empire was represented by the insignia of the Order of the Star of India and its motto 'Heaven's light our guide'. Some designs of the tablet referred to 'The United Kingdom', while others referred to 'The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland'. The text within the main design includes the mottoes used in the Royal Coat of Arms: Honi soit qui mal y <b>pense</b> and Dieu et mon droit. The material used was gilded and coloured gesso set in a stone surround. Other design elements included a banded laurel-like border with carved roses in each corner and one at bottom centre. Some designs differed in {{the placement of the}} names of the dominions, and some varied in the colours used. The Westminster tablet is 5 feet 10 inches by 2 feet 10 inches (177.8cm by 86.36cm). The Ypres tablet is 266cm by 127cm.|$|E

25|$|Unlike the king, Frederick was a {{knowledgeable}} amateur of painting, who patronised immigrant artists like Jacopo Amigoni and Jean Baptiste Vanloo, who painted the {{portraits of the}} prince and his consort for Frederick's champion William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath. The list of other artists he employed—Philip Mercier, John Wootton, George Knapton and the French engraver Joseph Goupy—represents some of the principal painterly figures of the English Rococo. The Prince was also crucially important for furthering {{the popularity of the}} Rococo style in the decorative arts, with a clear predilection for French Huguenot craftsmen, patronising silversmiths such as Nicolas Sprimont (1713–1771), toyshop owners like Paul Bertrand and carver and gilders, the most notable being Paul Petit (1729–c.1756) who first worked for the prince on William Kent's neo-Palladian state barge of 1732, which is still preserved in the National Maritime Museum. Petit worked on a handful of magnificent trophy frames in the Rococo style for Frederick that are among the most significant remaining testaments to his patronage of the decorative arts. One frame made for his namesake cousin in 1748, Frederick the Great of Prussia, was especially lavish and represented the esteem in which the Prince held his cousin, suggesting the Prince identified with Frederick the Great's style of enlightened rule, over that of his own father George II. Petit's frame contained a portrait of Frederick the Great painted by Antoine <b>Pense,</b> and remains today in the British Royal Collection.|$|E

500|$|For {{a fee of}} 100 guineas (£105), Pistrucci {{created the}} sovereign's design, {{engraving}} it himself. He depicted the saint atop a fiery steed which is trampling the wounded dragon. George has a broken spear in his hand; part is in the dragon and the remainder on the ground. Pistrucci's original design, used for circulation in 1817–1819 and reprised by the Royal Mint in 2017, has the ribbon of the Order of the Garter surrounding the George and dragon design, with its motto HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y <b>PENSE.</b> The design, with Saint George bearing a sword rather than a spear, is ordinarily seen on the sovereign, and was also used for the crown from 1818. Clancy noted of the design process for the crown, [...] "what emerges {{is the presence of}} Pole at each turn. He bombarded the young artist with suggestions and instructions on how the design should be changed from the shape of the sword to the perceived ferocity of the dragon." [...] Pistrucci had placed his full last name {{on both sides of the}} crown, for which he was criticised by the public, and some said the saint would surely fall off his horse with the next blow.|$|E
