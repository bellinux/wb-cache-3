40|$|The {{integration}} <b>of</b> increasing <b>penetrations</b> <b>of</b> {{renewable energy}} sources {{is one of the}} key drivers for the increased deployment of control and optimization on power systems. Much of this wind generation is connected to the distribution system, which presents a range of challenges to the operation of these networks, traditionally utilized solely for power delivery. This paper describes a demonstration program in Ireland which addresses two of the key challenges in delivering high <b>penetrations</b> <b>of</b> wind energy in a cost-effective and efficient manner. First, the paper addresses a trial of the advanced reactive power control capabilities of modern wind turbines, investigating how this resource can be better utilized from a distribution and transmission perspective. The second aspect is measures to improve the efficiency of the distribution system in light <b>of</b> these increasing <b>penetrations</b> <b>of</b> wind energy...|$|R

By {{comparing the}} eigenfunctions of Rayleigh wave in viscoelastic halfspace {{and the corresponding}} elastic halfspace, we found the <b>penetration</b> depth <b>of</b> Rayleigh wave in viscoelastic halfspace is always larger than in the corresponding elastic halfspace. But the difference is small. The ratio <b>of</b> <b>penetration</b> depth and wave length under different cases is calculated, the results show <b>penetration</b> ability <b>of</b> Rayleigh wave in viscoelastic halfspace is always stronger than the corresponding elastic case, and <b>penetration</b> ability <b>of</b> Rayleigh wave gets weaker when the Poisson's ratio is smaller. The <b>penetration</b> ability <b>of</b> Rayleigh wave is stronger when the Q value is smaller.

40|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} very small {{generators}} are being connected to electricity distribution systems around the world. Examples include photovoltaics (PV) and gas-fired domestic-scale {{combined heat and power}} (micro-CHP) systems, with electrical outputs {{in the region}} of 1 to 2 kW. These generators are normally installed within consumers' premises and connected to the domestic electricity supply network (230 V single-phase in Europe, 120 V in North America). There is a growing need to understand and quantify the technical impact that high <b>penetrations</b> <b>of</b> such generators may have on the operation of distribution systems.

Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have examined the impacts <b>of</b> integrating high <b>penetrations</b> <b>of</b> wind and solar energy on the Eastern and Western electric grids. The Eastern Wind Integration and Transmission Study (EWITS), initiated in 2007, examined the impact on power system operations of reaching 20 % to 30 % wind energy penetration in the Eastern Interconnection. The Western Wind and Solar Integration Study (WWSIS) examined the operational implications of adding up to 35 % wind and solar energy penetration to the Western Interconnect. Both studies examined the costs of integrating variable renewable energy generation into the grid and transmission and operational changes that might be necessary to address higher <b>penetrations</b> <b>of</b> wind or solar generation. This paper identifies key insights from these regional studies for integrating high <b>penetrations</b> <b>of</b> renewables in the U. S. electric grid.
