40|$|Abstract: Minimizing the {{cylinder}} wear and the consumption rate of cylinder {{oil in a}} large two-stroke marine diesel engine is of great economic importance. In Korea, a motor-driven cylinder lubricator for a large two-stroke marine diesel engine manufactured by Wärtsilä Switzerland Co., Ltd. was first developed by authors through the joint research of industry-university in 2002. The characteristic of the developed product is that can control automatically the oil feed rate to a load fluctuation by the motor drive and the offset cam. The performance of the product is not also inferior to the conventional one. For manufacturing the reliable and useful products, however, it is necessary to investigate further characteristics and improve the performance of a cylinder lubricator. In this study, the effect of quill with and without accumulator on maximum discharge pressure, delivery delay duration and oil feed rate relative to motor revolution speed using <b>plunger</b> <b>stroke</b> as a parameter is experimentally investigated by using the developed cylinder lubricator. It is found that the maximum discharge pressure with accumulator is higher than that of no accumulator as <b>plunger</b> <b>stroke</b> and motor revolution speed are elevated, and the delivery delay duration with accumulator is shorter than that of no accumulator as <b>plunger</b> <b>stroke</b> and motor revolution speed are increased. Also, oil feed rate with accumulator is les...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Minimizing the {{cylinder}} wear and the consumption rate of cylinder {{oil in a}} large two-stroke diesel engine is of great economic importance. A motor-driven cylinder lubricator for Sulzer RT-flex large two-stroke diesel engines developed by authors is in need of mounting a quill system to lubricate cylinder parts for a smooth operation. In order to apply the common-rail lubricating system to the developed cylinder lubricator as the second research stage, the mechanical quill system with a progressively quantitative distributor (M. D. S.) is improved in the electronically controlled quill system with an accumulating distributor (E. D. S.). In this study, the effects of lubricator motor speed, <b>plunger</b> <b>stroke</b> and cylinder back pressure on oil feed rate and inequality rate are experimentally investigated by applying E. D. S. to the developed cylinder lubricator. It is found that the oil feed rate of E. D. S. is higher than that of M. D. S. because of the increase of delivery speed and volume by changing the role of accumulator in the same experimental condition. It can be also shown that, in E. D. S., the inequality rate is decreased a little or hardly unchanged as {{the cylinder}} back pressure and <b>plunger</b> <b>stroke</b> is elevated, while the inequality rate increased in M. D. S [...] The inequality rates of E. D. S. and M. D. S. are lowered as the lubricator motor speed is increased.

This involves two test apparatus. The first apparatus consists of a closed container and a piston-like plunger. The face of the plunger is perforated to allow grease to flow {{from one side of the}} plunger to another as the plunger is worked up and down. The test grease is inserted into the container and the <b>plunger</b> is <b>stroked</b> 60 times while the test apparatus and grease are maintained at a temperature of 25 °C.|$|R
5000|$|Rotary piston and plunger pumps use a crank {{mechanism}} {{to create a}} reciprocating motion along an axis, which then builds pressure in a cylinder or working barrel to force gas or fluid through the pump. The pressure in the chamber actuates the valves at both the suction and discharge points. Plunger pumps are used in applications that could range from [...] Piston pumps are used in lower pressure applications. The volume of the fluid discharged {{is equal to the}} area of the plunger or piston, multiplied by its stroke length. The overall capacity of the piston pumps and plunger pumps can be calculated with the area of the piston or <b>plunger,</b> the <b>stroke</b> length, the number of pistons or plungers and the speed of the drive. The power needed from the drive is proportional to the pressure and capacity of the pump.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{functional}} automotive part, reaction shaft support, was fabricated {{by local}} squeeze and vacuum Diecasting (LSVD) with light-weight Al- 15 %Si hypereutectic alloy which has good fluidity and excellent wear resistance. The effects of local squeezing pressure and time-lag of LSVD process on the microstructure {{of the product}} were investigated. Measurement of specific gravity with the change of local squeeze pressure and time-lag showed that the local squeezing effect can be increased by increasing squeeze pressure and decreasing time-lag. However, too high a squeeze pressure and too a low time-lag brought about insufficient squeezing effect due to instant movement to the squeeze <b>plunger</b> <b>stroke</b> end point. Through the combination of vacuum suction before melt injection and local squeezing after melt injection in LSVD process, light-weight Al- 15 %Si alloy reaction shaft support was successfully developed, resulting in excellent microstructural and mechanical propertie...|$|E
40|$|A fuel {{delivery}} method that patented by authors realised by numerical and natural experiments. The traditional system is added a lock organ before an injector. The injector cavity {{is connected with}} the force main only for the time of injecting fuel. After a valve closing the injector cavity is connected with the cavity of low pressure. When cutting off {{at the end of}} the working <b>plunger</b> <b>stroke</b> the force main is discharging. In a delivery high-pressure the accumulation of energy flow takes place, it increases speed growing of pressure in the injection beginning. The valve closing is accompanied by fast pressure decrease in the end of injection process. Such feeder of fuel allows dividing forcing and dosing out processes. It improves, in comparison with traditional, both adaptive and power properties of system. Numerical experiments confirm working capacity of the modernised fuel feed system. Defined influence of its basic constructive and adjusting parameters on indicators of process of {{fuel delivery}} is presented. The offered system allows a flexible adjustment of the cycle fuel feed when changing a high speed regime as well as providing for a set speed Diesel characteristic and a versatile regulation if the cycle feed at Diesel start.

The measure system consists of IPC, sensors, a data acquisition card and a type of software programmed by using VC++. It can real-time collect, display, process and analyze the parameters and loads of the working parts. Wheat straws with 40 % moisture content were used to carry on compression and baling experiments.
