The beach vegetation is largely Spinifex longifolius (beach spinifex), Salsola kali (<b>prickly</b> <b>saltwort),</b> Atriplex cinerea (grey saltbush) and naturalised Cakile maritima (sea rocket). Stable dunes are vegetated by Atriplex paludosa (marsh saltbush), Scaevola crassifolia (thick-leaved fan-flower), Olearia axillaris (coastal daisy-bush), Myoporum insulare (blueberry tree) and Exocarpos sparteus (broom ballart). Sheltered areas behind dunes support Salsola kali and Myoporum insulare and also Nitraria billardierei (nitre bush), the last of these being the only plant on the island to grow over m (5ft) high.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{available}} knowledge on sedimentology, hydrodynamics and five major ecosystem components (microphytobenthos, vascular plants, terrestrial arthropods, zoobenthos, and avifauna) of Belgian sandy beaches. It covers {{the area from}} the foredunes to the lower foreshore, takes an ecosystem approach to beaches of this specific geographic area. Morphodynamically, Belgian beaches are (ultra-) dissipative, macrotidal, and wide. Characteristic grain sizes are 160 - 380 µm. The sand becomes coarser, beach slopes steeper and tidal range smaller towards the south-west, where beaches have also been frequently reshaped by human interference such as nourishment. Beach organisms are highly adapted to this unique environment and can reach high numbers. We show that even on a heavily populated coastline subjected to intense recreational and development pressure, beaches provide critical, yet threatened, habitats. Vascular plants growing near the drift line, on the dry beach and in the embryonic dunes are mostly short-lived and thalassochorous; the most common species include sea rocket (Cakile maritima), <b>prickly</b> <b>saltwort</b> (Salsola kali subsp. kali), and sea sandwort (Honckenya peploides). These zones are habitat to a highly diverse suite of terrestrial arthropods of halobiontic, halophilous and haloxene species; prominent members are sandhoppers (Talitrus saltator) and dipterans (flies). Microphytobenthos, mainly diatoms, is an important primary producer on Belgian beaches but is not well known. The meio- and macrobenthos of Belgian beaches contains specific assemblages such as the Scolelepis squamata-Eurydice pulchra community of the upper intertidal zone. Birds no longer nest on the beaches itself, but Belgian sandy shores continue to function as important resting and foraging areas for birds such as the sanderling Calidris alba. We identify several human pressures on the beach ecosystems arising from recreation, beach management and fisheries...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a comprehensive {{overview of the}} available knowledge on sedimentology and hydrodynamics and five major ecosystem components - microphytobenthos, vascular plants, terrestrial arthropods, zoobenthos (macrobenthos, meiobenthos, hyperbenthos and epibenthos) and avifauna - of Belgian sandy beaches (from foredunes to foreshore). An ecosystem overview is presented for this specific geographically delimited shoreline, instead of dealing with a single component only. Belgian beaches are (ultra-) dissipative, macrotidal and wide beaches with a cross-shore average median grain size of 160 - 380 μm. Sediment becomes coarser, slopes steeper, tidal range smaller towards the east. Especially eastern beaches have been reshaped frequently through human action (e. g. beach nourishment). Belgian beaches are characterised {{by the presence of}} highly adapted organisms. It is demonstrated that even a highly recreational and heavily populated coastline like the Belgian coast provides valuable yet threatened habitats to several beach-dependent species, which may reach high numbers. Vascular plants of the drift line, dry beach and embryonic dunes are mostly short-lived and thalassochorous. Most common species are sea rocket (Cakile maritima), <b>prickly</b> <b>saltwort</b> (Salsola kali subsp. kali) and sea sandwort (Honckenya peploides). Terrestrial arthropods inhabiting the same general area are highly diverse, comprising halobiontic, halophilous and haloxene species. Prominent members of this fauna are sandhopper (Talitrus saltator) and dipterans (flies). Microphytobenthos is an important primary producer on Belgian beaches, mainly consisting of diatoms. Very little is known about this group of organisms. Belgian beaches also have a specific zoobenthic fauna in both meiofauna and macrofauna, e. g. the typical upper intertidal Scolelepis squamata-Eurydice pulchra community. Also epi- and hyperbenthic animals depend on the beach, e. g. as nursery grounds. Nowadays no nesting of birds occurs on the beach itself. Nevertheless, Belgian beaches are important for resting and foraging (e. g. sanderling Calidris alba). Little is know about biological interactions on Belgian beaches. Human actions associated with several aspects of recreation, beach management and fisheries, are endangering all the discussed biota, and are specified...|$|E
