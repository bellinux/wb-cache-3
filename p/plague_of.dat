5|$|London {{was plagued}} by disease in the early 17th century, {{culminating}} in the Great <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> 1665–1666, which killed up to 100,000 people, or {{a fifth of the}} population.|$|E
5|$|In 1665, Charles {{was faced}} with a great health crisis: the Great <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> London. The death toll reached a peak of 7,000 per week in the week of 17 September. Charles, with his family and court, fled London in July to Salisbury; Parliament met in Oxford. Plague cases ebbed over the winter, and Charles {{returned}} to London in February 1666.|$|E

5|$|The {{conclusion}} that the army's size remained constant between 235 and 285 appears implausible, as this period saw the Third Century Crisis, during which the army's recruitment capacity was severely diminished by {{the impact of the}} <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> Cyprian, numerous civil wars and devastating barbarian invasions.|$|E
5|$|The {{prolonged}} and escalating ByzantineSassanid {{wars of the}} 6th and 7th {{centuries and}} the recurring outbreaks of bubonic plague (<b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> Justinian) left both empires exhausted and vulnerable {{in the face of}} the sudden emergence and expansion of the Arabs. The last of these wars ended with victory for the Byzantines: Emperor Heraclius regained all lost territories, and restored the True Cross to Jerusalem in 629.|$|E

5|$|Hoskins {{describes}} {{the abandonment of}} villages from the bubonic <b>plague</b> <b>of</b> 1348, the Black Death, which killed a third to a half of the population (he states), and the subsequent new colonisation and building as the population eventually recovered. Marginal land such as the Breckland of Norfolk and Suffolk, never thickly populated, was abandoned. Many villages in counties such as Leicestershire were deserted. Villages such as Lower Ditchford in Gloucestershire can be seen today only as a ground-plan from the air.|$|E
5|$|In 1513 the Kaqchikel {{suffered}} from a <b>plague</b> <b>of</b> locusts. The following year, in 1514, Iximche was severely damaged by a fire. A plague, described as terrible in the Annals of the Kaqchikel, struck the city in 1519 and lasted two years, resulting in {{a large number of}} deaths. This was likely to have been smallpox brought to the Americas with the Spanish. After the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan fell to the Spanish onslaught in 1521, the Kaqchikel sent messengers to Hernán Cortés offering an alliance with the Spanish.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, {{novelist and}} playwright George Cram Cook {{produced}} his first full-length play, The Athenian Women (an adaption of Lysistrata), which portrays Aspasia leading a strike for peace. Cook combined an anti-war theme with a Greek setting. American writer Gertrude Atherton in The Immortal Marriage (1927) treats {{the story of}} Pericles and Aspasia and illustrates {{the period of the}} Samian War, the Peloponnesian War and the <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> Athens. Taylor Caldwell's Glory and the Lightning (1974) is another novel that portrays the historical relationship of Aspasia and Pericles.|$|E

5|$|John Carson as the {{replacement}} Captain Foster ("White Ghost"). A British actor {{of television and}} cinema, Carson's small-screen credits of the 1960s and 70s include The Saint, Man in a Suitcase, Department S and The Professionals, while his film roles include <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> the Zombies (1966) and Taste the Blood of Dracula (1970). His appearances in The Troubleshooters {{attracted the attention of}} the Andersons. Carson's delivery of Foster's lines has led to a mistaken assertion that fellow British actor James Mason was cast for the role.|$|E
5|$|Seven years later, in 542, {{a devastating}} {{outbreak}} of Bubonic Plague, {{known as the}} <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> Justinian and second only {{to that of the}} 14th century, laid siege to the world, killing tens of millions. As ruler of the Empire, Justinian, and members of his court, were physically unaffected by famine. However, the Imperial Court did prove susceptible to plague, with Justinian himself contracting, but surviving, the pestilence.|$|E
5|$|The Great <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> 1665/1666 was {{the last}} major {{outbreak}} of bubonic plague in Great Britain. The last recorded death from plague came in 1679, and it was removed as a specific category in the Bills of Mortality after 1703. It spread to other towns in East Anglia and the southeast of England but fewer than ten percent of parishes outside London had a higher than average death rate during those years. Urban areas were more affected than rural ones; Norwich, Ipswich, Colchester, Southampton and Winchester were badly affected, while the West of England and areas of the Midlands escaped altogether.|$|E

5|$|The Great <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> London {{struck in}} the summer of 1665, and the Theatre Royal, along with all other public entertainment, was shut down by order of the Crown on 5 June. It {{remained}} closed for 18 months until the autumn of 1666, during which time it received at least a little interior renovation, including widening of the stage. Located well {{to the west of the}} City boundary, the theatre was unaffected by the Great Fire of London, which raged through the City in September 1666, but it burned down six years later on 25 January 1672.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> Justinian and the Arab conquests would {{represent}} a substantial reversal of fortunes contributing to a period of stagnation and decline. Isaurian reforms and, in particular, Constantine V's repopulation, public works and tax measures, {{marked the beginning of}} a revival that continued until 1204, despite territorial contraction. From the 10th century {{until the end of the}} 12th, the Byzantine Empire projected an image of luxury and travellers were impressed by the wealth accumulated in the capital.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} stories were both seen in Medieval- and Renaissance {{theology}} as prefiguring the Crucifixion of Jesus. In {{the story of}} the Brazen Serpent, the people of Israel become dissatisfied and grumble at God. As punishment they receive a <b>plague</b> <b>of</b> venonous snakes. God offers the people relief by instructing Moses to make a snake of brass and set it up on a pole, the sight of which gives miraculous healing. Michelangelo chooses a crowded composition, depicting a dramatic mass of suffering men, women, and writhing snakes, separated from redeemed worshipers by the snake before an epiphanic light.|$|E

Daniel quickly tires of the radical Puritan rhetoric of his father, Drake Waterhouse, and decides to join Reverend John Wilkins and Robert Hooke at John Comstock's Epsom estate.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 12th century Irish {{influence}} became a significant feature of island life and Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó, the High King of Ireland took possession of Mann and the Isles until 1072. The {{records for the}} rulers of the Hebrides are obscured again until the arrival of Godred Crovan as King of Dublin and the Isles. The ancestor {{of many of the}} succeeding rulers of Mann and the Isles, he was eventually ousted by Muirchertach Ua Briain and fled to Islay, where he died in the <b>plague</b> <b>of</b> 1095. It is not clear the extent to which Ui Briain dominance was now asserted in the islands north of Man, but growing Irish influence in these seas brought a rapid and decisive response from Norway.|$|E
5|$|Direct trade {{links between}} the Mediterranean lands and India had been {{established}} in the late 2nd century BC by the Hellenistic Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt. Greek navigators learned to use the regular pattern of the monsoon winds for their trade voyages in the Indian Ocean. The lively sea trade in Roman times is confirmed by the excavation of large deposits of Roman coins along much of the coast of India. Many trading ports with links to Roman communities {{have been identified in}} India and Sri Lanka along the route used by the Roman mission. Archaeological evidence stretching from the Red Sea ports of Roman Egypt to India suggests that Roman commercial activity in the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia declined heavily with the Antonine <b>Plague</b> <b>of</b> 166 AD, the same year as the first Roman embassy to Han China, where similar plague outbreaks had occurred from 151 AD.|$|E
