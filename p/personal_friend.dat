5|$|His {{political}} {{projects were}} put on hold, and Caragiale instead concentrated his energy on obtaining the French Légion d'honneur order, eventually becoming one of its Chevaliers in December 1929. The Romanian author himself noted that this had been {{made possible by the}} intercession of François Lebrun, the Bucharest correspondent of Le Matin newspaper, whom he considered a <b>personal</b> <b>friend.</b>|$|E

5|$|It is {{significant}} that the only musician with whom he remained a close <b>personal</b> <b>friend,</b> Ignaz Moscheles, was of an older generation and equally conservative in outlook. Moscheles preserved this outlook at the Leipzig Conservatory until his own death in 1870.|$|E
5|$|Jackson, {{leading the}} new Democratic Party, won the 1828 presidential election, and in March 1829 Eaton {{resigned}} his Senate seat to accept appointment as Jackson's Secretary of War. The appointment was seemingly made because of Jackson's {{desire to have}} a <b>personal</b> <b>friend</b> in the Cabinet in whom he could confide.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{has been}} faulted for poor {{coordination}} {{and management of}} his generals. This includes his reluctance to resolve a dispute between Leonidas Polk, a <b>personal</b> <b>friend,</b> and Braxton Bragg, who was defeated in important battles and distrusted by his subordinates. He was similarly reluctant to relieve the capable but overcautious Joseph E. Johnston until, after numerous frustrations which he detailed in a March 1, 1865 letter to Col. James Phelan of Mississippi, he replaced him with John Bell Hood.|$|E

5|$|In 1801 while {{aboard the}} 74-gun HMS Ganges (commanded by Captain Thomas Fremantle, a <b>personal</b> <b>friend),</b> Brock {{was present at}} the Battle of Copenhagen. His troops were {{supposed}} to lead an assault on the forts at Copenhagen. The outcome of the sea battle made such an assault unnecessary, and Brock was able to observe first-hand the tactical brilliance of Lord Nelson. After the battle, Fremantle and Brock celebrated the victory with Nelson. In 1802 Brock and the 49th Foot were ordered to Canada.|$|E

Ashikaga Yoshihisa was enraged by the rebellion and ordered Rennyo to excommunicate his followers in Kaga. However, Hosokawa Katsumoto, a <b>personal</b> <b>friend</b> and ally of Rennyo, brokered a deal which allowed Rennyo to merely reprimand the Kaga ikki.|$|E
5|$|Together with Weldon Irvine, Simone turned Lorraine Hansberry's {{unfinished}} play To Be Young, Gifted and Black into a {{civil rights}} song. Hansberry had been a <b>personal</b> <b>friend</b> whom Simone credited with cultivating her social and political consciousness. She performed the song live on the album Black Gold (1970). A studio recording was released as a single, and renditions of the song have been recorded by Aretha Franklin (on her 1972 album Young, Gifted and Black) and by Donny Hathaway.|$|E
5|$|Also in the off-season, Gillis fired Luongo's goaltending coach Ian Clark {{and hired}} Roland Melanson in his place. Luongo {{had been a}} <b>personal</b> <b>friend</b> of Clark's and {{publicly}} stated being surprised and disappointed with the switch. The decision to hire Melanson was largely precipitated on his willingness to work with Luongo on a full-time basis – something Clark was unable to do. Despite the coaching change at the club level, Luongo retained Clark as his personal coach for his summer training. He began working with Melanson {{leading up to the}} 2010–11 season and employed several changes in his playing style, which included playing deeper into his crease instead of challenging shooters.|$|E

Simms' book was {{published}} {{a few months after}} Stowe's novel, and it contains a number of sections and discussions disputing Stowe's book and her view of slavery. Hentz's 1854 novel, widely read at the time but now largely forgotten, offers a defense of slavery as seen {{through the eyes of a}} northern woman—the daughter of an abolitionist, no less—who marries a southern slave owner.|$|E
5|$|Another helpful {{character}} is a young local girl, who watches the reconstruction efforts from afar, and scampers off when she is seen. The girl, played by Carradine's real life domestic partner, Barbara Hershey, provides a tool box and some food. Detractors of the veteran's efforts include a band of local teenagers, {{one of whom is}} played by John Blyth Barrymore, a <b>personal</b> <b>friend</b> of Carradine's and a frequent guest star on Kung Fu.
