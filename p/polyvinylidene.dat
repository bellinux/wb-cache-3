5|$|Polymers {{exhibit the}} same {{stability}} increases afforded by fluorine substitution (for hydrogen) in discrete molecules; their melting points generally increase too. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), the simplest fluoropolymer and perfluoro analogue of polyethylene with structural unit , demonstrates this change as expected, but its very {{high melting point}} {{makes it difficult to}} mold. Various PTFE derivatives are less temperature-tolerant but easier to mold: fluorinated ethylene propylene replaces some fluorine atoms with trifluoromethyl groups, perfluoroalkoxy alkanes do the same with trifluoromethoxy groups, and Nafion contains perfluoroether side chains capped with sulfonic acid groups. Other fluoropolymers retain some hydrogen atoms; <b>polyvinylidene</b> fluoride has half the fluorine atoms of PTFE and polyvinyl fluoride has a quarter, but both behave much like perfluorinated polymers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polyvinylidene</b> {{chloride}} is a polymer {{derived from}} vinylidene chloride. Its use {{can be found}} in water-based coating, the production of household items and industrial products. Ralph Wiley, a Dow Chemical lab worker, accidentally discovered <b>polyvinylidene</b> chloride in 1933.|$|E
25|$|Other {{ferroelectric}} {{materials used}} include triglycine sulfate, <b>polyvinylidene</b> fluoride (PVDF) and lithium tantalate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polyvinylidene</b> {{fluoride}} (PVDF): PVDF exhibits piezoelectricity {{several times}} greater than quartz. Unlike ceramics, where the crystal structure of the material creates the piezoelectric effect, in polymers the intertwined long-chain molecules attract and repel each other when an electric field is applied.|$|E
25|$|At the FPD 2008 exhibition, Japanese company Soken {{demonstrated}} a wall with electronic wall-paper using this technology. In 2007, the Estonian company Visitret Displays is developing {{this kind of}} displays using <b>polyvinylidene</b> fluoride (PVDF) as the material for spheres, dramatically improving the video speed and decreasing the control voltage.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polyvinylidene</b> {{fluoride}} (PVDF) has a {{very high}} permittivity of 18 to 20, which allows large amounts of energy to be stored in a small space (volumetric efficiency). However, it has a Curie temperature of only 60nbsp&°C, which limits its usability. Film capacitors with PVDF are described for one very special application, in portable defibrillators.|$|E
25|$|Creep {{can cause}} gradual {{cut-through}} of wire insulation, especially when stress is concentrated by pressing insulated wire against a sharp edge or corner. Special creep-resistant insulations such as Kynar (<b>polyvinylidene</b> fluoride) {{are used in}} wirewrap applications to resist cut-through due to the sharp corners of wire wrap terminals. Teflon insulation is resistant to elevated temperatures and has other desirable properties, but is notoriously vulnerable to cold-flow cut-through failures caused by creep.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the high}} {{reactivity}} of ozone, only a few materials may be used like stainless steel (quality 316L), titanium, aluminium (as long as no moisture is present), glass, polytetrafluorethylene, or <b>polyvinylidene</b> fluoride. Viton may be used with the restriction of constant mechanical forces and absence of humidity (humidity limitations apply depending on the formulation). Hypalon may be used with the restriction that no water {{come in contact with}} it, except for normal atmospheric levels. Embrittlement or shrinkage is the common mode of failure of elastomers with exposure to ozone. Ozone cracking is the common mode of failure of elastomer seals like O-rings.|$|E
25|$|Besides the above-described films ((Polypropylene (PP), Polyethylene Terephthalate Polyester PET), Polyphenylene Sulfide (PPS), Polyethylene Naphthalate (PEN), Polycarbonate (PP), Polystyrene (PS) and Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)), {{some other}} plastic {{materials}} {{may be used}} as the dielectric in film capacitors. Thermoplastic polymers such as Polyimide (PI), Polyamide (PA, better known as Nylon or Perlon), <b>Polyvinylidene</b> fluoride (PVDF), Siloxane, Polysulfone (PEx) and Aromatic Polyester (FPE) are described in the technical literature as possible dielectric films for capacitors. The primary reason for considering new film materials for capacitors is the relative low permittivity of commonly used materials. With a higher permittivity, film capacitors could be made even smaller, an advantage in the market for more-compact portable electronic devices.|$|E

2500|$|Major {{intermediates}} {{from the}} halogenation and hydrohalogenation of ethylene include ethylene dichloride, ethyl chloride and ethylene dibromide.

2500|$|As a salt, its {{dominant}} use is as an emulsifier for the {{emulsion polymerization}} of fluoropolymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, or Teflon), <b>polyvinylidene</b> fluoride, and fluoroelastomers. For this use, 3M subsidiary Dyneon has a replacement emulsifer despite DuPont stating PFOA is an [...] "essential processing aid". PFOA {{is used in}} the production of Gore-Tex as it is PTFE-based. In PTFE processing, PFOA is in aqueous solution and forms micelles that contain tetrafluoroethylene and the growing polymer. PFOA can be used to stabilize fluoropolymer and fluoroelastomer suspensions before further industrial processing and in ion-pair reversed-phase liquid chromatography it can act as an extraction agent. PFOA also finds uses in electronic products and as an industrial fluorosurfactant.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{filtration}} in a winery can {{be classified}} as either the coarser depth filtration or the finer surface filtration. In depth filtration, often done after fermentation, the wine is pushed through {{a thick layer of}} pads made from cellulose fibers, diatomaceous earth, or perlite. [...] In surface filtration, the wine passes through a thin membrane. Running the wine parallel to the filter surface, known as cross-flow filtration, will minimize the filter clogging. The finest surface filtration, microfiltration, can sterilize the wine by trapping all yeast and, optionally, bacteria, and so is often done immediately prior to bottling. An absolute rated filter of 0.45µm is generally considered to result in a microbially stable wine and is accomplished by the use of membrane cartridges, most commonly <b>polyvinylidene</b> fluoride (PVDF). Certain red wines may be filtered to 0.65µm, to remove yeast, or to 1.0µm to remove viable brettanomyces only.|$|E
2500|$|One way to {{directly}} convert waste heat into electricity is by executing the Olsen cycle on pyroelectric materials. The Olsen cycle {{consists of two}} isothermal and two isoelectric field processes in the electric displacement-electric field (D-E) diagram. The principle of the Olsen cycle is to charge a capacitor via cooling under low electric field and to discharge it under heating at higher electric field. Several pyroelectric converters {{have been developed to}} implement the Olsen cycle using conduction, convection, or radiation. It has also been established theoretically that pyroelectric conversion based on heat regeneration using an oscillating working fluid and the Olsen cycle can reach Carnot efficiency between a hot and a cold thermal reservoir. Moreover, recent studies have established <b>polyvinylidene</b> fluoride trifluoroethylene [...] polymers and lead lanthanum zirconate titanate (PLZT) ceramics as promising pyroelectric materials to use in energy converters due to their large energy densities generated at low temperatures. Additionally, a pyroelectric scavenging device that does not require time-varying inputs was recently introduced. The energy-harvesting device uses the edge-depolarizing electric field of a heated pyroelectric to convert heat energy into mechanical energy instead of drawing electric current off two plates attached to the crystal-faces.|$|E
2500|$|The Venetia Burney Student Dust Counter (VBSDC), {{built by}} {{students}} at the University of Colorado Boulder, is operating continuously to make dust measurements. It consists of a detector panel, about , mounted on the anti-solar face of the spacecraft (the ram direction), and an electronics box within the spacecraft. The detector contains fourteen <b>polyvinylidene</b> difluoride (PVDF) panels, twelve science and two reference, which generate voltage when impacted. Effective collecting area is [...] No dust counter has operated past the orbit of Uranus; models of dust in the outer Solar System, especially the Kuiper belt, are speculative. The VBSDC is always turned on measuring the masses of the interplanetary and interstellar dust particles (in the range of nano- and picograms) as they collide with the PVDF panels mounted on the New Horizons spacecraft. The measured data is expected to greatly contribute {{to the understanding of}} the dust spectra of the Solar System. The dust spectra can then be compared with those from observations of other stars, giving new clues as to where Earth-like planets can be found in the universe. The dust counter is named for Venetia Burney, who first suggested the name [...] "Pluto" [...] at the age of 11. A thirteen-minute short film about the VBSDC garnered an Emmy Award for student achievement in 2006.|$|E
2500|$|To {{make the}} {{proteins}} accessible to antibody detection, they are moved {{from within the}} gel onto a membrane made of nitrocellulose or <b>polyvinylidene</b> difluoride (PVDF). [...] The primary method for transferring the proteins is called electroblotting and uses an electric current to pull proteins from the gel into the PVDF or nitrocellulose membrane. [...] The proteins move from within the gel onto the membrane while maintaining the organization they had within the gel. An older method of transfer involves placing a membrane {{on top of the}} gel, and a stack of filter papers on top of that. The entire stack is placed in a buffer solution which moves up the paper by capillary action, bringing the proteins with it. In practice this method is not used as it takes too much time; electroblotting is preferred. As a result of either [...] "blotting" [...] process, the proteins are exposed on a thin surface layer for detection (see below). Both varieties of membrane are chosen for their non-specific protein binding properties (i.e. binds all proteins equally well). Protein binding is based upon hydrophobic interactions, as well as charged interactions between the membrane and protein. Nitrocellulose membranes are cheaper than PVDF, but are far more fragile and do not stand up well to repeated probings.|$|E

50|$|The {{differences}} between thermograms {{can be seen}} in the example of four different chloro-polymers: (a) polyvinyl chloride, (b) chlorinated polyvinyl chloride, (c) chlorinated rubber, and (d) <b>polyvinylidene</b> chloride. There are two stages of degradation in these four polymers. The first stage is the loss of hydrogen chloride, and is complete around 250 °C. This first step occurs at lower temperatures for the polymers containing more chlorine (chlorinated polyvinyl chloride, chlorinated rubber, and <b>polyvinylidene</b> chloride), implying that these chloride groupings are less stable than in polyvinyl chloride.|$|E
50|$|While {{extremely}} {{useful as}} a food packaging agent, the major disadvantage of <b>polyvinylidene</b> chloride {{is that it will}} undergo thermally induced dehydrochlorination at temperatures very near to processing temperatures. This degradation easily propagates, leaving polyene sequences long enough to absorb visible light, and change the color of the material from colorless to an undesirable transparent brown (unacceptable for one of <b>polyvinylidene</b> chloride chief applications: food packaging). Therefore, there is a significant amount of product loss in the manufacturing process, which increases production and consumer costs.|$|E
50|$|In the 1990s, the {{production}} of PVC of self-generated <b>polyvinylidene,</b> based on an expensive material, acetylene generated with methane half-combustion method was not, except for special periods, profitable.
