50|$|It is {{a rugged}} terrain riding for long and extra-long {{distance}} up to 50 km. Being {{the most prestigious}} and difficult type of baigue Alaman Baigue was {{the main part of}} large national festivals and funeral. Contests were held in the steppe on a direct road full of natural hindrances without limits numbers of horses and their breeds. The riders were usually boys of age 14 years old who were already experienced horsemen. Only mature horses of 3 years and upwards can participate in Alaman Baigue. There is no common standard of distance length of the race. In Kazakhstan the distance of 21 and 31 km is usually used. Occasionally races for 50 and 100 km are held.Only specially prepared racers participate in this type of baiga. <b>Pure-bred</b> <b>horses</b> of rare breeds such as the Thoroughbed, Arabian, Akhal-Teke horses, etc. are excluding from the race.|$|E

5000|$|He {{was born}} in Hillsborough, Albert County, the son of Cornelius McMonagle, a native of Ireland, and Anne Scott. McMonagle later settled in Sussex Corner. He was married twice: first to Margaret Roach and then to Mary Roach, her sister. McMonagle raised cows and work horses as well as raising and {{training}} <b>pure-bred</b> race <b>horses.</b> He introduced the Morgan horse to New Brunswick. McMonagle's horse Livingstone defeated George Gilbert's Retriever in the so-called [...] "Great race of 1847".|$|R
2500|$|To {{a greater}} degree than any earlier painter, Stubbs {{produced}} genuinely individual portraits of specific horses, paying intimate attention to details of their form. Minute blemishes, veins, and the muscles flexing {{just below the surface}} of the skin are all visible and reproduced with great care and realism. [...] Whistlejacket had already retired after a fairly successful racing career, but was painted in this unusual form to show [...] "a supremely beautiful specimen of the <b>pure-bred</b> Arabian <b>horse</b> at its finest".|$|R
50|$|The Kiso breed {{originates}} {{from the}} Kiso Valley and the Kiso Sanmyaku mountain range, in Nagano Prefecture, and the Higashimino region of Gifu Prefecture, in central Honshu. During the Meiji era (1868-1912) it was severely {{affected by the}} breeding programme of the Imperial Japanese Army, which wanted taller horses and ordered that all stallions of the breed should be gelded, and that only imported stallions be used to cover Kiso mares. After the Second World War few <b>pure-bred</b> Kiso <b>horses</b> remained. A single stallion, dedicated to a religious shrine, had escaped castration. His son Daisan-haruyama was born in 1951 and is the foundation stallion of the present-day breed.|$|R
50|$|Oak Grove is an unincorporated {{community}} in the Washington District of Westmoreland County, Virginia. The community, on the historic Northern Neck of Virginia (the peninsula between the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers), was a stagecoach stop {{in the early days}} of the Colony of Virginia. This town is populated mainly by animals, consisting of French-bred cows and <b>pure-bred</b> Saudi Arabian <b>Horses.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Wealthy Sheikh Riyadh (Omar Sharif) {{has sent}} his attaché Aziz (Adam Alexi-Malle) {{to ask the}} show to either stop using the phrase [...] "the world's {{greatest}} distance horse and rider" [...] or allow Hopkins and Hidalgo to prove themselves by entering the Middle Eastern [...] "Ocean of Fire" [...] race:an annual 3,000-mile survival race across the Najd desert region. The Sheikh is custodian of the al-Khamsa line, {{considered to be the}} greatest distance horses in the world, and traditionally the race has been restricted to <b>pure-bred</b> Arabian <b>horses</b> and Bedouin or Arab riders.

5000|$|Over {{the next}} few years, {{numerous}} homesteads and small settlements were established along the Sun River. The town of Sun River grew up near [...] "The Leavings" [...] (where the road left the Sun River valley), and Vaughn and his neighbors constructed an irrigation ditch {{that allowed them to}} grow barley, oats, potatoes, and wheat. Although Vaughn started out farming, he quickly turned to ranching. He imported a large number of <b>pure-bred</b> cattle and <b>horses,</b> and his horses were some {{of the best in the}} state.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} major yearly events celebrating {{folklore}} in Slavonia and Baranja: Đakovački vezovi, Vinkovačke jeseni and Brodsko kolo. They present traditional folk costumes, folklore dancing and singing groups, customs, with {{a parade of}} horses and wedding wagons as a special part of the program. During the Đakovački vezovi, the Đakovo Cathedral hosts choirs, opera artists, and art exhibitions are organized in the exhibition salon, and during the sports program, <b>pure-bred</b> white Lipizzaner <b>horses</b> {{can be seen on}} the racecourse. Ilok and the war-torn city of Vukovar are also points of interest in the area.|$|R
500|$|The breed's {{survival}} {{during the}} 20th century is owed {{to a few}} families who continued to breed the Cracker horse and kept distinct bloodlines alive. John Law Ayers was one such breeder; in 1984, he donated his herd of <b>pure-bred</b> Cracker <b>horses</b> {{to the state of}} Florida. With them, the state started three small herds in Tallahassee, Withlacoochee State Forest and Paynes Prairie State Preserve. By 1989, however, these three herds and around 100 other horses owned by private families were all that remained of the breed. In 1989 the Florida Cracker Horse Association was founded and in 1991 a registry was established. After the registry was created, 75 horses designated as [...] "foundation horses" [...] and 14 of their offspring were immediately registered. These horses came mainly from four lines of Cracker bloodstock and were designated as purebreds by breed experts – partbred horses were denied entry to the registry. As of 2009, around 900 horses had been registered since the foundation of the registry.|$|R
50|$|The central {{traditional}} {{event is}} called Đakovački vezovi (Đakovo Embroidery). It is a folklore {{show of the}} regions Slavonia and Baranja that is organized yearly {{in the beginning of}} July, and it presents traditional folk costumes, folklore dancing and singing groups, customs. The Cathedral hosts choirs, opera artists, and art exhibitions are organized in the exhibition salon. The horse and wedding wagon show is a special part of the program. During the sports program, <b>pure-bred</b> white Lipizzaner <b>horses</b> can be seen on the racecourse. They come from the horse-breeding centre in Ivandvor, which has been breeding horses ever since 1506.|$|R
50|$|The festival {{lasts for}} 2 weeks and usually ends {{on the first}} weekend of July when the main event, the {{procession}} of the folklore groups {{from all parts of}} Croatia, takes place. These folklore groups present traditional folk costumes and perform traditional songs and dances, or even customs. There are also special parts of the program such as the horse and wedding wagon show, the races of <b>pure-bred</b> white Lipizzaner <b>horses</b> from the horse-breeding centre in Ivandvor, which has been breeding horses ever since 1506, the concerts in the Đakovo Cathedral and the tasting of delicacies and wines.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the death}} of Campbell in 1827 the estate was sold. A {{subsequent}} owner, Charles Smith, established Bungarribee stud shortly after 1830, which only had <b>pure-bred</b> English <b>horses.</b> Bungarribee was a major rural employer and breeding area for Australia’s horse racing industry. Bungarribee’s horses dominated the emerging racing scene in NSW in the 1820s and 1830s https://web.archive.org/web/20120120130128/http://www.landcom.com.au/whats-new/latest-news/choose-your-own-builder-at-bunya.aspx, and many of Australia's most prominent race horses trace their bloodlines to Bungarribee. Steeltrap Drive is named {{after one of the}} most successful horses of this era and runs through the middle of the site. Many of today’s most prominent race horses can trace their history along Steeltrap’s blood line. Manto Street is named after Manto, one of the greatest horses that was one of the main breeding mares at Bungarribee. Sir Hercules Parade is named after Sir Hercules, who was the sire of the 1866 Melbourne Cup winner The Barb. Additional names include Velocity Parade, Gipsy Street, Emigrant Parade, Emancipation Street and Bet Hyatt Avenue - all named after successful thoroughbreds bred at Bungarribee....|$|R
40|$|Abstract WorldFengur is the {{database}} that contains and functions as the studbook of {{origin of the}} Icelandic <b>horse.</b> Only <b>pure-bred</b> Icelandic <b>horses,</b> whose ancestry {{can be traced back}} to Iceland entirely, may be registered into WorldFengur. The WorldFengur project is a joint effort by the FAIC (Farmers Association of Iceland) and FEIF (International Federation of Icelandic Horse Associations) to construct an official and central database on horses of Icelandic origin located all over the world. It is used in this capacity in 19 countries so far; the number of data stored in the WorldFengur database has increased continuously. The database itself has developed tremendously since it was established in 2001; it includes information on horses’ pedigrees and offspring, as well as results of breeding assessments and sports competitions, owners, breeders, breeding prediction values (BLUP), colours, microchip numbers, health records, DNA profiles for checking ancestries and much more. The key words in its development are common solutions to common challenges internationally. The requirements to fulfill both national and international regulations, such as the latest EU directive on the identification of equidae - no 504 / 2008 /EU -, have increased in recent years and the WorldFengur project continuously endeavours to stay in line with these developments. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the sera concentrations of iron, copper, zinc and manganese trace minerals in thirty <b>Pure-bred</b> Lusitano athlete <b>horses</b> before and after exercise certified by clinical and laboratory assessments were studied. Blood samples were taken before and after 20 minutes of a dairy trot and gallop slight training, perfomed in a sandy floor ring, to measure the mineral concentrations, by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. It was observed that after exercising, the serum activity of iron did not change (P= 0. 2365), whereas copper values have significantly risen after training (P< 0. 001). On the other hand, zinc and manganese trace minerals decreased after exercise (P< 0. 001). In conclusion, {{it is possible to}} consider that the short time exercise may trigger sweating and consequently to change the seru...|$|R
50|$|While {{trying to}} make his fortune gold mining in Nelson Gulch near what is now Helena, Montana, Welsh American {{immigrant}} Robert Vaughn became convinced that Montana was excellent ranching and farming country. In the fall of 1869, he traveled into Chouteau County, Montana, {{which at the time}} covered nearly a sixth of the state. About 9 mi upstream from where the Sun River joined the Missouri River, he decided to homestead. He returned to Helena and filed paperwork to claim the land, and learned he was the first individual to formally file for a homestead in Chouteau County. Although Vaughn started out farming, he quickly turned to ranching. He imported a large number of <b>pure-bred</b> cattle and <b>horses,</b> and his horses were some {{of the best in the}} state.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to propose the optimal {{methodology}} for stallion semen morphology analysis while taking into consideration the staining method, the microscopic techniques, and the workload generated by a number of samples. Material and Methods: Ejaculates from eight <b>pure-bred</b> Arabian <b>horses</b> were tested microscopically for the incidence of morphological defects in the spermatozoa. Two different staining methods (eosin-nigrosin and eosin-gentian dye), two different techniques of microscopic analysis (1000 × and 400 × magnifications), and two sample sizes (200 and 500 spermatozoa) were used. Results: Well-formed spermatozoa and those with major and minor defects according to Blom’s classification were identified. The applied staining methods gave similar results and could be used in stallion sperm morphology analysis. However, the eosin-nigrosin method was more recommendable, because it allowed to limit the number of visible artefacts without hindering the identification of protoplasm drops and enables the differentiation of living and dead spermatozoa. Conclusion: The applied microscopic techniques proved to be equally efficacious. Therefore, it is practically possible to opt for the simpler and faster 400 x technique of analysing sperm morphology to examine stallion semen. We also found that the number of spermatozoa clearly affects the results of sperm morphology evaluation. Reducing the number of spermatozoa from 500 to 200 causes a decrease in the percentage of spermatozoa identified as normal and an increase in the percentage of spermatozoa determined as morphologically defective...|$|R
40|$|In {{studies of}} {{chromosome}} instability, the {{sister chromatid exchange}} (SCE) test is a particularly sensitive cytogenetic assay for detecting DNA damage. SCE tests of chromosome instability were performed {{in the group of}} 6 <b>horse</b> breeds (<b>Pure-bred</b> Arabian, Malapolski <b>horse,</b> Polish noble half-bred, Polish cold-blooded, Hucul and Polish Konik). The chromosome preparations were obtained from our in vitro culture of peripheral blood lymphocytes stained using the FPG technique. The mean number of SCEs/cell in the analysed population of horses was 5. 14 ± 1. 44. The mean frequency of SCEs in the 6 analysed horse breeds varied depending on the breed. Statistically significant differences were observed between the horse breeds (P < 0. 01). No statistically significant differences in the number of SCEs per cell were found between the males and females (5. 10 ± 1. 34 and 5. 20 ± 1. 52, respectively). The horses were also assessed for the number of SCEs/cell in relation to the age of the animals. The differences between the age groups were statistically significant (P < 0. 01) ...|$|R
