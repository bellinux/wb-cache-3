By December 2009, the Communications Authority launched an investigation into TVB after rival ATV's complaint, alleging that TVB had violated the Broadcasting Ordinance. TVB was then fined HK$900,000 by the city’s communications watchdog for engaging in anti-competition practices including [...] "harsh and unreasonable" [...] terms in contracts with some singers and artistes, and a [...] "No Cantonese Policy" [...] that prohibits contract artistes from speaking Cantonese on other Hong Kong TV stations’ programmes. [...] On June 12, 2014, the Communications Authority received Hong Kong Television Network (HKTVN)'s complaint against TVB, alleging that TVB had executed in anti-competition conduct by abusing trade mark law and procedures to prevent HKTVN from obtaining a domestic free-to-air television <b>programme</b> services <b>licence</b> ("FTV licence") in order to strengthen TVB's dominance in Hong Kong television programme service market. Meanwhile, due to dominance, {{the quality of the}} product of TVB declines with times.

40|$|In 1998, the {{combined}} Provincial Road Safety Boards in the Netherlands decided {{to develop a}} policy path for permanent traffic education for driving licence holders. In this, they distinguish between the various age groups. The provinces of Flevoland and Groningen commissioned SWOV to make {{a study of the}} feasibility of traffic education for the target group of 25 - 60 years old. The study consists of two parts. In the first part a study was made of where the road safety problems of the target group lie, and of which points of application there are for traffic education. This part used the literature and analysis of databases. In the second part, the design of this traffic education, especially the learning goals, was examined. It was determined which behaviour and which of its influence factors need attention for educating the target group. For the learning goals, the same structure was used as for that of the car driving licence, as formulated by the Ministry of Transport. The specific learning goals were discussed in interviews with key figures of the permanent traffic education in the Netherlands. The interviews determined the primary items for permanent traffic education of the target group. Furthermore, the interviews, together with the literature, indicated points of application for the design of a programme for permanent traffic education and the roles that the various organisations could play. Based on this, it is suggested how Provincial Road Safety Boards can stimulate and strengthen education <b>programmes</b> for driving <b>licence</b> holders...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) granted {{exceptional}} {{licenses for}} the medical use of cannabinoids, typically for 6 months with possible extensions. A systematic review of cannabinoids for medical use commissioned by the FOPH supports the use of cannabinoids {{for the treatment of}} chronic pain and spasticity. However, {{little is known about the}} patients treated with cannabinoids. We aimed to study medical uses of cannabinoids as part of the FOPH's programme of exceptional licenses.; We examined all requests for medical use of cannabinoids sent to FOPH in 2013 and 2014. A standardised data sheet was developed to extract data from the files of approved requests. We extracted the duration of the licence, the year it was granted, and the payer of the therapy. At the level of the patient we collected the date of birth, sex, region of residence, diagnosis and the indication. Ethical approval was granted by the Ethics Committee of the Canton of Bern.; We analysed 1193 patients licenced for cannabinoid treatment in 2013 or 2014. During 2013, 542 patients were treated under the exceptional <b>licencing</b> <b>programme</b> (332 requesting physicians) compared with 825 in 2014 (446 physicians). Over half of patients (685; 57 %) were women. The mean age was 57 years (standard deviation 15. 0), chronic pain (49 %) and spasticity (40 %) were the most common symptoms, and co-medication was reported for 39 % of patients. Seventy-eight different diagnoses were recorded, including multiple sclerosis (257 patients, 22 %), soft tissue disorders (119, 10 %), dorsalgia (97, 8. 1 %), spinal muscular atrophy (65, 5. 5 %) and paraplegia/tetraplegia (62, 5. 2 %). Licence extensions were granted to 143 patients (26. 4 %) in 2013 and 324 patients (39. 3 %) in 2014. There were substantial regional variations of the rates of patients treated with cannabinoids. On average, eight patients per 100 000 residents received an exceptional licence. Most patients (1083, 91 %) paid out of pocket.; Exceptional licences for medical use of cannabinoids have increased substantially in Switzerland, with the programme including patients with a wide range of conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{doctoral}} thesis was to supplement the traditional optional compulsory course “Laboratory diagnostics for viral infections in horses” with eLearning components {{in a context of}} blended learning. Blended learning is a form of eLearning which combines training ses¬sions with compulsory attendance and computer-aided, internet-based learning. The work consisted of four essential parts: 1.) development of the eLearning programme with prior determination of requirements, 2.) development of online tests, 3.) optimization of a laboratory diagnostic test, and 4.) subjective evaluation of the eLearning programme in a participant survey. First of all, requirements were determined in a questionnaire during an optional compulsory course offered in traditional form in the winter semester of 2005. The results of the survey provided important insights concerning the expectations and demands made on eLearning programmes by the course participants. These findings were considered to a large extent in the conception of the eLearning programme. After eliciting the available technical resources – it was considered to use either html or an authoring tool (software) – the knowledge of how to use suitable authoring software was acquired during a one-week workshop organized at the Center for Digital Systems (CeDiS). After the workshop, {{the decision was made to}} use the Trivantis software “Lectora Interna¬tional Publishing Suite” for the compilation of the eLearning <b>programme.</b> A user <b>licence</b> for “Lectora” was inexpensively acquired by the Central Facility for Computing Services (ZEDAT) of the Freie Universität Berlin. Lectora allows the compilation of eLearning materials even without profound html knowledge. Updates can be performed with little effort within the eLearning programme. The eLearning programme imparts knowledge about virus families which may be involved in respiratory diseases of horses, necessary for the practical part of the optional compulsory course. Thus it allows the differential diagnostic investigation and/or exclusion of possible viral pathogens. With “Lectora” all intended functionalities and a multimedia-based appealing design were implemented as requested. The eLearning programme is furthermore easy to use. It contains many interactive pages presenting questions. After these are answered, feedbacks with the correct answers are shown so that the users can already assess their individual learning out¬come while they are working with the programme. The content of the eLearning programme was also converted to pdf format and made avail¬able on the learning platform “Blackboard” so that the course participants could choose to print out the files. 87 % of the participants exercised this option. In addition to the programme, online tests were generated which allowed the course partici¬pants to individually assess the learning outcome. Unlike the learning programme, the tests were not compiled using the authoring software “Lectora”, but via the general learning plat¬form “Blackboard” of the Freie Universität Berlin. They were designed as multiple choice tests without grading which could be taken by the participants several times within a fixed period of provision. For the present thesis, this period of provision was limited to four weeks (two weeks before the optional compulsory course and two weeks after the end of the course). Those course participants who chose to assess their learning outcome with the help of the online tests (about one third of the course participants) mostly did all six available tests and without exception obtained good results. The participants could take the tests several times and the most recently obtained results were shown in the grade book. The tests proved to be well adapted for the assessment of the individual learning outcome, efforts should however be made to motivate the remaining course participants to take the tests, too. In this respect, the course participants should be informed about the online tests during the virology lectures already. It should be emphasized that the tests will not be graded and were developed merely with the aim to assess the individual learning outcome. Due to the fact that the best learning outcome will be achieved by hands-on exercises, it was decided to add not only eLearning components to the course repertoire, but also a concrete laboratory diagnostic test. A hemadsorption test was selected and optimized in order to suit the requirements for a practical course. The following conditions had to be fulfilled by the test: - The test had to be feasible within the three lessons of the course, - the test had to produce concrete results, and - it should not have already been performed during the general virology practical course. The selected hemadsorption test produced well-analyzable results. The plan is that partici¬pants of future optional compulsory training courses will conduct the hemadsorption test independently. After the course participants had worked with the eLearning programme, they were consulted about their experiences in the framework of a subjective evaluation using another question¬naire. They were asked to evaluate the eLearning programme. The results showed that the eLearning programme was very favourably received by the course participants. 70 % of the participants stated that working with the eLearning programme had a positive influence on their motivation to deal with the subject matter, and 85 % of the participants invested more time into looking into the subject matter thanks to the learning programme. All participants supported the development of more eLearning programmes at the Institute of Virology, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Freie Universität Berlin. The present thesis has shown that supplementing traditional courses with eLearning compo¬nents has proven to be a useful measure which will therefore continue to be developed at the Institute of Virology...|$|R
