The study was undertaken among a random sample of 120 farmers from eight <b>pilot</b> <b>villages</b> exposed to the technology. Descriptive statistics and a logit regression model were used to analyse data. The findings show that more farmers in <b>pilot</b> <b>villages</b> of Siaya are taking up the use of Tithonia than in Vihiga. As of 2004, 52 % of farmers in Siaya were adopters compared to only 8 % in Vihiga. Results of the logit regression model show that the use of Tithonia biomass for soil fertility management (SFM) {{is more likely to be}} adopted in a context where there is a scarcity of animal manure, farmers are willing to plant it on farms and hire casual labour. The use of Tithonia by smallholder farmers for SFM is therefore a promising low-cost option that can be scaled up to areas where farmers face similar constraints...|$|R

40|$|REDD+ aims {{to reduce}} {{deforestation}} and forest degradation {{in the developing}} countries. Forests and related resources are important sources of income for rural households. Kilosa district is one area in Tanzania where the REDD+ initiative was introduced. The pilot project started in 2010 and ended in 2014. This study aims at ‘taking stock’ of REDD+ in terms of discovering whether the intervention had any impact on local people’s livelihoods in Kilosa district. More specifically, the study evaluates changes in local institutions, people’s evaluation of these changes and the possible impacts of REDD+ on people’s livelihoods. The study {{is part of the}} ‘Man and Forests’ project which was funded by the Norwegian Research Council in 2014. This study employed two theoretical frameworks, namely the environmental governance systems framework and the rural livelihoods framework. In terms of methodology, the study used BACI (before-after-control-impact) design whereby both qualitative and quantitative research methods were used. Following this methodology, field data from Kilosa district was collected from two <b>pilot</b> <b>villages</b> (Nyali and Lunenzi) and two control villages (Zombo and Lumango) in 2010 and 2015. Field data included household surveys and qualitative data. Additionally, the study used literature from secondary sources and archives. Qualitative data was used to assess the changes in institutions and the local people’s evaluation of the changes. The results from these data showed a shift of property rights, from state property to common property, in the <b>pilot</b> <b>villages.</b> Moreover, there were changes in formal rules regarding use of forest and related resources in these two villages. Despite the existence of the formal rules, illegal timber logging and charcoal making were common activities in Nyali in both periods. Regarding control villages, there were no changes in property rights, as one would expect. Rules for use of resources have also not changed since 2010. However, it was observed that use of resources was de facto under open access in 2015 {{as was the case in}} 2010. When it comes to local people’s evaluations of the institutional changes, it was discovered that majority of the informants in the <b>pilot</b> <b>villages</b> were satisfied with the REDD+ as well as the pre-REDD+ rules. The two main reasons for satisfaction with the pre-REDD+ rules in both villages were equal distribution of resource use and benefits and good accessibility to resources. However, it seems that people in Lunenzi were more positive to the pre-REDD+ compared to those in Nyali. Additionally, the results suggested weaker forest governance in Nyali compared to Lunenzi in 2010. In terms of REDD+ rules, the two main reasons for satisfaction were issues such as clear boundaries and people’s participation in making rules. Concerning variations across the villages, the results showed that people in Lunenzi were more positive than those in Nyali as was the case in 2010. In addition, forest governance was still better in Lunenzi in 2015 compared to Nyali. Nevertheless, it was noted that forest governance had improved in Nyali in 2015 compared to 2010. The results from the surveys reveal severe reductions in gross total household incomes in both <b>pilot</b> and control <b>villages</b> between the two study periods. Moreover, there were reductions in most of the income categories. This is mainly because of drought that hit these villages in 2014. To test whether REDD+ has had a role to play in this respect, panel data analysis was done for gross total household incomes, total forest incomes and total farmed area. Results from the panel data analysis showed that REDD+ did not have significant effect on local people’s gross total income and total farmed area. Interestingly, REDD+ had a positive impact on total forest income. The thesis recommends national policies for poverty alleviation in Kilosa district and beyond. It further proposes an increase in alternative livelihoods and agricultural investments in the REDD+ <b>pilot</b> <b>villages</b> in order to reduce deforestation...|$|R

The quality of recovered graywater {{was similar to that}} of the water found in the adjacent stream, which is a concept of zero discharge system with graywater. Separated urine, in either fresh or stored form, was diluted with collected rainwater and with reused water without any detergent from a sink, to be supplied to vegetable garden as fertilizer. Separated dried feces were composted in the garden for approximately 3 months and then used as fertilizer. Dried and composted feces, together with stored urine, were characterized in terms of microbial community using pyrosequencing, to identify the presence of any potential pathogens, in order to confirm the system provides safe hygiene.

40|$|What are the {{barriers}} and benefits {{in developing and}} transferring new cottage industry papermaking technology using Westerlund’s Five Phases of Appropriate Technology Transfer Model. The best available craft technology is developed, in this case by the author, and a new model applied whereby innovative, appropriate, sustainable technology can be transferred to help under- developed countries. This model applies a ‘technical action research’ methodology to implement the new Westerlund’s Five Phase strategy for the transfer of technology to craft villages in developing countries. This generic new technology transfer model was tested with a controlled pilot plant for highest quality cottage craft technology of papermaking in a remote island village of Wainimakutu, Fiji, where English is a second-third language, by first redesigning and making specialised equipment, teaching {{the use of the}} equipment to skilled village artisans, value adding raw recycled paper into photocopy grade paper, then pioneering the production of traditional science based story books. This lifted the combined skill set from craft to a new genre of intensive cottage industry craft. Another pilot plant was trialled in an Australia Lifestyle village. The 5 -phase model is based on a foundation and the following steps. First is the Foundation Phase of getting to know the existing village, their culture, the level of technology, management and craft skills. Phases 1 and 2 introduces safe easy small then bigger steps in hardware and software technology. These involve making some specialised newly co-designed hardware/equipment with the author/scientist/inventor and local industry and university help while trying to source and/or make the standard manufacturing components locally. Phase 3 builds on Phases 1 and 2 and enables more radical ‘leapfrog’ steps to advanced (western papermaking) technology to gain a competitive quality and or marketing edge (smooth 150 gsm paper). Phase 4 is the ‘vertical technology transfer’, where value adding takes place, enabling a higher quality raw standard product and a wider range of value added products {{to be made in the}} village and or local city. This involved several village, industry and university workshops over a few years of technology transfer. In this case from rough handmade paper (300 gsm) into a finer, smooth sided 150 gsm quality paper suitable for printing and photocopiers. Cultural story books were also made. Phase 5 is the ‘horizontal technology transfer’ where the technology is carried over to the next village using their new skills in papermaking and with the ownership of the new improved intellectual property. In this case local NGO workshops were organised using the upskilled training staff from the <b>pilot</b> <b>village.</b> This project provides an initial trial and a solid basis for further research into a future Phase 6 on marketing eco-friendly and sustainable products from developing countries in a new world paradigm; and Phase 7 on new management systems. The study included two case study projects, one Fijian village verses one Australian Lifestyle village, which were evaluated from four main perspectives. Firstly, the first hand designing, making and testing of new improvements in papermaking equipment to make the best quality smooth hand made paper. Secondly, the implementation of the ‘technical action research’ was measured by the quality of the new craft paper produced for the printing industry. Several types of quality books were printed, bound and published as real examples, this included cultural stories from the village made into books for the school. Thirdly, a new modified point system survey was theoretically developed and applied to complement the five phases by rating the making of the equipment and transfer of craft (papermaking) skills; and the vertical and horizontal transfers. Fourthly, the United Nations guidelines were also modified and used to trial the evaluation with a maximum coefficient and rating system to generate optimum values of eco-friendly sustainable transfer of appropriate technologies. In summary, the developing country setting enabled a successful trial of the new best available design and testing of equipment and the new generic technology transfer model. They appreciated the advances in hardware and software technology and have upgraded their existing papermaking project to use most of the new technology. The village depend on this project as an employment cornerstone of their remote highland village. The retired tradesmen in the Australian lifestyle village helped the author codesign and test new advances in cottage industry craft papermaking technology and push the quality parameters to new levels, however the life-stylers were more interested in enjoying retiring than taking on a new hobby of papermaking.

40|$|The {{challenge}} of increasing irrigation prices while increasing farmers' income exists {{not only in}} China but in other countries as well. The overall goal {{of this paper is}} to evaluate whether a win-win strategy can be realized in a pilot reform in Hebei, China. The data came from a two-round field survey in 2009 and 2012, which indicated that the key mechanism of the pilot reform was that farmers received similar returns (including reallocated, increased irrigation fees and a government subsidy), but paid different irrigation fees; the difference between the returned money and payment was treated as an incentive for farmers to reduce their use of irrigation. The econometric results showed that in <b>pilot</b> reformed <b>villages,</b> local farmers' groundwater application for irrigating wheat and cotton could decrease by 21 % each. If no subsidies are granted, roughly half of the region's farmers would lose money due to the reform. However, most farmers who receive subsidies were able to earn money in the <b>pilot</b> reformed <b>villages.</b> If several issues are properly resolved (such as selecting more representative villages, increasing the subsidy value, and negatively linking the subsidy with water use), it would be possible for more regions to realize a win-win price reform strategy.

The concerted effort of government and stakeholders to combat this disease is progressing well. At present, the government’s control program consists of mass vaccination, selected targeted culling, and education with a goal to eradicate rabies from the island by 2015. The additional effort on the establishment of participatory rabies prevention, control and surveillance system within the local community level is needed to improve the ongoing and future rabies control efforts. As part of a project “Ecohealth Approaches for Optimizing the Rabies Control Program in Bali”, organized by CIVAS, with support from the IDRC and led by ILRI, within the project, we developed and piloted a community-based model for sustainable rabies control driven by community involvement in two villages in Karangasem and Gianyar districts in Bali. Promising results from <b>pilot</b> <b>villages</b> model indicates high participation of the community (formed 82 cadres in Gianyar and Karangasem) on the public awareness, early reporting, early response and early detection on bitten cases and supporting on government program particularly on the mass vaccination by registration data of the dog within community to achieved high coverage on vaccination (> 70 %). This efforts suggests that involving community members more actively in villages through the institutionalization of ‘rabies village working groups’ could substantially improve surveillance activities with possible effects on improving dog management and vaccination coverage. With little direct financial input such participation creates a sense of community ownership. This approach showed affective on improving early response, early detection and surveillance system that could be used effectively across other districts in Bali.

The expectations are that tourism development (TD) can be supportive for the conservation of AHS while creating benefits for local communities. In this study, two mountainous <b>pilot</b> <b>villages</b> (Longxian and Xiaohuang) in a global conservation project for traditional agricutural systems - Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) were selected to identify the relationship between AHS conservation and TD. The study undertook in-depth interviews, and questionnaires of village residents and informal discussions with local villagers. A t-test and a linear regression model were implemented to explore the comparative dimensions of the two communities with different geographical location, economic situation, and stage of TD. The research found some similarities and differences in the two mountainous communities during AHS conservation and TD. Firstly, AHS are preservaed well in both villages unconsiously, while the residents in Xiaohuang value more highly the heritage elements than the respondents in Longxian, and the villagers in Xiaohuang are more worried about their heritage system; Secondly, both villages expect lots of benefits from TD and they clearly perceive more positive than negative impact from tourism and thus approve TD, while the huge different perception on transportation and accessibility in the two villages reflects the bottleneck of TD in Xiaohuang village. At the same time, the respondents from Xiaohuang perceive more positive and fewer negative impact from tourism than the respondents from Longxian. Thirdly, the respondents in the two villages all show positive attitudes towards participation in tourism mostly motivated by the high income expectation. The main factors to determine the community perception in two villages were also analyzed based on the data process. A location-based conceputal framework of AHS conservation in partnership with TD at community scale is proposed at the end of the paper. The dynamics of tourism development, that could enhance a better understanding of the complex relationship between conservation objectives and tourism development are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of small}} {{ruminants}} in poverty alleviation and {{their contribution to}} sustainable livelihoods especially in rural areas have been demonstrated by several Research and Development (R&D) programmes in Sub-Saharan Africa. Proposals have been made for the evolvement of purebreeding schemes {{for the conservation of}} the genetic pool which the WAD goat represents. A crucial starting point however, is the characterisation and the establishment of breed standards for WAD goats under village conditions. So far, there has been little progress in this regard on account of the difficulties in establishing on-farm data recording schemes. Also, comprehensive studies relating to the within breed diversity among WAD goats are rare. Such studies will show details about performance and morphometric characteristics of WAD goats in their native environment. All these represent vital information needed for breed characterisation and the establishment of breed standards. A conceptual framework for the attainment of these objectives is presented, with illustrations drawn from an ongoing R&D project involving WAD goats. The framework is hinged on on-farm livestock performance recording systems. Project inception embraced awareness campaigns and sensitisation of farmer groups, where the scope and rationale for the studies are discussed. <b>Pilot</b> <b>villages</b> are randomly selected from different ecozones where WAD goats are raised in Southwestern Nigeria. Research methodology involved structured household interviews combined with fortnightly visits and the establishment of on-farm recording schemes. Data on performance, morphometric and qualitative traits at all ages are recorded. Direct observations and documentation of all aspects of the rural setting relating to the raising of WAD goats — farming systems and feed resources - are documented. With data accumulation, computer databases are created for data management, analysis, interpretation/information retrieval. Analysis of data helps to derive doe productivity indices under village conditions. The framework involves some feedback mechanism to provide farmers with innovative techniques in goat management and simple selection schemes within each village. Overall, the framework will facilitate the design of appropriate genetic improvement measures geared towards boosting the productivity of WAD goats under smallholder units.

It is regarded as a popular and quiet area as well as holiday village for tourists and vacationers. Ljugarn is the oldest seaside resort in Gotland, and was formerly a port, fishing <b>village,</b> <b>pilot</b> station and the county seat of Ljugarn County. The 1.5 km long flat sandy beach, one of the longest in Gotland, is visited throughout the year. Since the early 20th century the village has had pensions, restaurants, hostels, coffee-shops and a grocery store.|$|R
40|$|In 2009, Norway started funding REDD+ {{readiness}} in Tanzania, {{which includes}} nine pilot projects, {{with a maximum}} amount of 100 million NOK yearly for 5 years. These pilots are all implemented by different nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Before they move to a full-scale implementation, the countries are going through this so-called REDD+ readiness process where consultation is received, policies are designed, and mechanisms are being tested and evaluated (Angelsen et al., 2009, p. 3). Based on my fieldwork where I spent time with a NGO, and stayed in two of their <b>pilot</b> <b>villages,</b> this thesis aims to give an insight into processes {{that are going on}} at project level under an unfinished framework of the REDD+ forest regime. It concentrates on REDD+ as a discourse in the making, and on levels and locations of agency and accountability in the process. Here I perceive the events that are driving the discourse into being as what Anna Tsing (Tsing, 2005) terms frictions related to the project, where agencies are unfolded. Similarly, I also consider some situations where I propose that the necessary frictions are not taking place to detect accountability in the process of project implementation. My analysis here recognizes two reasons for this; one is that the discourse in the making also draws on similar discourses that already have a strong presence in Tanzania, like those of conservation and development. The second reason is the respect for what is stipulated in contracts and agreements as opposed to what is not. It is represented by two forms of the project – one {{in the form of the}} Design, another in the form of Real action. Annelise Riles (2000) made this distinction in her analysis of NGO work in Fiji, and I draw several parallels to her work on the aesthetics of information, form and facts throughout the thesis. I look into aspects of how information sharing is happening through documents in the NGO, and how the mechanisms of Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) can have significance for the project in Tanzania. By doing all this I present ways that the project is in process, and argues that ambitions through designs can show that elaboration and implementation of the project at the same time is possible, but suggest that the reality of the project can be perceived differently by the people in the areas where it is implemented...|$|R
