5|$|Laboratory {{tests show}} that fruit bodies have {{antimicrobial}} activity against several strains of drug-resistant bacteria that are pathogenic in humans. Extracts inhibit {{the growth of}} the Gram-negative bacteria Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes, and kill the Gram-positive species <b>Pasteurella</b> multocida, Streptococcus agalactiae and S.pyogenes. A separate study demonstrated growth inhibition against Proteus vulgaris.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid has no {{clinically}} {{significant effect on}} most Gram-negative bacteria. Pseudomonas and the Enterobacteriaceae, for instance, are not susceptible. In vitro, it is active against <b>Pasteurella</b> multocida, Fusobacterium, Moraxella catarrhalis, Legionella, Bordetella, and Elizabethkingia meningoseptica, and moderately active (having a minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of strains of 8mg/L) against Haemophilus influenzae. It has also been used to great effect as a second-line treatment for Capnocytophaga infections.|$|E
5|$|Fleas and ticks {{are common}} causes of {{physical}} irritation. In {{a study in}} Egypt, a species of Hyalomma was dominant in dromedaries, comprising 95.6% of the adult ticks isolated from the camels. In Israel, the number of ticks per camel ranged from 20 to 105. Nine camels in the date palm plantations in Arava Valley were injected with ivermectin, which is not effective against Hyalomma tick infestations. Larvae of the camel nasal fly Cephalopsis titillator can cause possibly fatal brain compression and nervous disorders. Illnesses that can affect dromedary productivity are pyogenic diseases and wound infections caused by Corynebacterium and Streptococcus, pulmonary disorders caused by <b>Pasteurella</b> such as hemorrhagic septicemia and Rickettsia species, camelpox, anthrax, and cutaneous necrosis caused by Streptothrix and deficiency of salt in the diet.|$|E
5|$|Guinea pigs do not {{generally}} thrive when housed with other species. Housing of guinea pigs with other rodents such as gerbils and hamsters may increase instances of respiratory and other infections, and such rodents may act aggressively toward the guinea pig. Larger animals may regard guinea pigs as prey, though some (such as dogs) {{can be trained}} to accept them. Opinion is divided over the cohousing of guinea pigs and domestic rabbits. Some published sources say that guinea pigs and rabbits complement each other well when sharing a cage. However, as lagomorphs, rabbits have different nutritional requirements, so the two species cannot be fed the same food. Rabbits may also harbor diseases (such as respiratory infections from Bordetella and <b>Pasteurella),</b> to which guinea pigs are susceptible. Even the dwarf rabbit is much stronger than the guinea pig and may cause intentional or inadvertent injury.|$|E

25|$|Pasteurellosis is a {{bacterial}} disease associated with animal bites and scratches. <b>Pasteurella</b> {{is a normal}} bacterium that also lives in the mouths of healthy cats. The bacteria do not typically make cats sick; however, cats can develop abscesses or skin infections in places where they were scratched or bitten by another animal.|$|E
25|$|Rabies {{results in}} the death of {{approximately}} 55,000 people a year, with most of the causes due to dog bites. Capnocytophaga canimorsus, MRSA, tetanus, and <b>Pasteurella</b> can be transmitted from a dog to someone bitten by the dog. Bergeyella zoohelcum is an emerging infection transmitted through dog bites. Infection with B. zoohelcum from dog bites can lead to bacteremia.|$|E
25|$|The {{bacterium}} <b>Pasteurella</b> multocida and its genus {{can pose}} {{a risk of}} severe diseases in high-risk {{groups such as the}} elderly, transplant recipients, cancer patients and immunocompromised individuals. Transmission of the infection to the human from the cat has been attributed to kissing the cat, providing care that exposes the person to the body fluids of the cat and sleeping with the cat.|$|E
25|$|Yersinia pestis (formerly <b>Pasteurella</b> pestis) is a Gram-negative, {{rod-shaped}} coccobacillus, non mobile with no spores. It is a {{facultative anaerobic}} organism that can infect humans via the oriental rat flea. It causes the disease plague, which takes three main forms: pneumonic, septicemic, and bubonic plagues. All three forms {{were responsible for}} a number of high-mortality epidemics throughout human history, including: the 6th century's Plague of Justinian, the Black Death, which accounted for the death of at least one-third of the European population between 1347 and 1353, and the Third Pandemic, sometimes referred to as the Modern Plague, which began in the late 19th century in China and spread by rats on steamboats claiming close to 10 million lives. These plagues probably originated in China and were transmitted west via trade routes.|$|E
25|$|Pasteur {{publicly}} {{claimed his}} success in developing the anthrax vaccine in 1881. However, his admirer-turned-rival Toussaint {{was the one who}} developed the first vaccine. Toussaint isolated the bacteria that caused chicken cholera (later named <b>Pasteurella</b> in honour of Pasteur) in 1879 and gave samples to Pasteur who used them for his own works. On July 12, 1880, Toussaint presented his successful result to the French Academy of Sciences, using an attenuated vaccine against anthrax in dogs and sheep. Pasteur on grounds of jealousy contested the discovery by publicly displaying his vaccination method at Pouilly-le-Fort on 5 May 1881. Pasteur gave a misleading account of the preparation of the anthrax vaccine used in the experiment at Pouilly-le-Fort. He used potassium dichromate to prepare the vaccine. The promotional experiment was a success and helped Pasteur sell his products, getting the benefits and glory.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{sources of}} {{mortality}} are largely reported in anecdotes. On rare occasions, golden eagles {{have been killed}} by competing predators or by hunting mammalian carnivores, including the aforementioned wolverine, snow leopard, cougar, brown bear and white-tailed eagle attacks. Most competitive attacks resulting in death probably occur at the talons of other golden eagles. Nestlings and fledglings {{are more likely to be}} killed by another predator than free-flying juveniles and adults. It has been suspected that golden eagle nests may be predated more frequently by other predators (especially birds, which are often the only other large animals that can access a golden eagle nest without the assistance of man-made climbing equipment) in areas where golden eagles are regularly disturbed at the nest by humans. Jeff Watson believed that common raven occasionally eats golden eagle eggs but only in situations where the parent eagles have abandoned their nesting attempt. However, there are no confirmed accounts of predation by other bird species on golden eagle nests. Occasionally, golden eagles may be killed by their prey in self-defense. There is an account of a golden eagle dying from the quills of a North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) it had attempted to hunt. On the Isle of Rùm in Scotland, there are few cases of red deer trampling golden eagles to death, probably the result of a hind having intercepted a bird that was trying to kill a fawn. Although usually well out-matched by the predator, occasionally other large birds can put up a formidable fight against a golden eagle. An attempted capture of a great blue heron by a golden eagle resulted in the death of both birds from wounds sustained in the ensuing fight. There is at least one case in Scotland of a golden eagle dying after being “oiled” by a northern fulmar, a bird whose primary defense against predators is to disgorge an oily secretion which may inhibit the predator's ability to fly. Of natural sources of death, starvation is probably under-reported. 11 of 16 dead juvenile eagles which had hatched in Denali National Park had died of starvation. Of 36 deaths of golden eagles in Idaho, 55% were possibly attributable to natural causes, specifically 8 (26%) from unknown trauma, 3 (10%) from disease and 6 (19%) from unknown causes. Of 266 golden eagle deaths in Spain, only 6% were from unknown causes that could not directly attributed to human activities. Avian cholera caused by bacteria (<b>Pasteurella</b> multocida) infects eagles that eat waterfowl that have died from the disease. The protozoan Trichomonas sp. caused the deaths of 4 fledglings in a study of wild golden eagles in Idaho. Several further diseases that contribute to golden eagle deaths have been examined in Japan. A captive eagle died from two malignant tumors – one in the liver and one in the kidney.|$|E

2500|$|The {{resident}} flora [...] in {{the mouth}} of the cat includes <b>Pasteurella,</b> Staph, Bartonella, and Streptococcus species. Bites from cats more often develop infections more frequently than dogs. The teeth of a cat are sharp, pointed and can cause deep wounds. After a cat bite, the skin usually healing closes rapidly over the bite and traps microorganisms.|$|E
2500|$|Y. pestis was {{discovered}} in 1894 by Alexandre Yersin, a Swiss/French physician and bacteriologist from the Pasteur Institute, during an epidemic of the plague in Hong Kong. Yersin {{was a member of}} the Pasteur school of thought. Kitasato Shibasaburō, a German-trained Japanese bacteriologist who practised Koch's methodology, was also engaged at the time in finding the causative agent of the plague. However, [...] Yersin actually linked plague with Y. pestis. Named <b>Pasteurella</b> pestis in the past, the organism was renamed Yersinia pestis in 1944.|$|E

5000|$|Before {{molecular}} technology was available, species were often labeled based on staining and the hosts from where species were isolated. [...] The name [...] "multocida" [...] was ultimately adopted to represent all the <b>Pasteurella</b> species. [...] Until 1932, the genus <b>Pasteurella</b> only {{consisted of the}} species type <b>Pasteurella</b> multocida. [...] <b>Pasteurella</b> canis sp. nov. was previously classified as P. multocida biotype 6 or “dog-type” strains. In 1985, <b>Pasteurella</b> underwent taxonomic reclassiﬁcation based on DNA hybridization, resulting in several subspecies of P. multocida and new <b>Pasteurella</b> species, including P. canis.|$|E

50|$|Many <b>Pasteurella</b> {{species are}} {{zoonotic}} pathogens, and humans can acquire an infection from domestic animal bites. In cattle, sheep, and birds, <b>Pasteurella</b> species {{can cause a}} life-threatening pneumonia; in cats and dogs, however, <b>Pasteurella</b> is not a cause of disease, and constitutes part of the normal flora of the nose and mouth. <b>Pasteurella</b> haemolytica is a species that infects mainly cattle and horses: P. multocida is the most frequent causative agent in human <b>Pasteurella</b> infection. Common symptoms of pasteurellosis in humans include swelling, cellulitis, and bloody drainage {{at the site of}} the wound. Infection may progress to nearby joints, where it can cause further swelling, arthritis, and abscesses.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pasteurella</b> multocida {{was first}} found in 1878 in cholera-infected birds. However, {{it was not}} {{isolated}} until 1880, by Louis Pasteur, in whose honor <b>Pasteurella</b> is named.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pasteurella</b> is a genus of Gram-negative, facultatively {{anaerobic}} bacteria. <b>Pasteurella</b> {{species are}} nonmotile and pleomorphic, and often exhibit bipolar staining ("safety pin" [...] appearance).
