40|$|There are {{at least}} three major species {{differences}} among the <b>pumpkins</b> and <b>winter</b> <b>squashes.</b> And, their response to herbicides differ, so {{it is important to know}} which types are sensitive to a particular herbicide to avoid crop injury. The major jack o’lantern pumpkin belongs to Cucurbita pepo (as does summer squash, acorn squash, and gourds), butternut wintersquash is a member of C. moschata, and the buttercups and hubbards belong to C. maxima. The primary preemergence herbicides used are Curbit, Command, Sandea, and Strategy. Curbit and Command control a number of broadleaves and grasses, and Sandea has both pre and postemergence activity on many broadleaves. Strategy, a premix of Curbit and Command, is labeled for all the vine crops, including jack-o-lanterns. All of the vine crops are somewhat sensitive to Sandea, so careful use is recommended.

40|$|<b>Winter</b> <b>squash</b> and <b>pumpkin</b> {{growers in}} the Northeast are seeking {{production}} {{systems that are}} more costeffective than those they are currently using. An intensive plasticulture system that utilizes transplants and high plant populations, plastic mulch and drip irrigation, scouting, and as-needed fertilizer and pesticide applications is consistent with this objective because it results in greatly increased yields of marketable fruit. This system increases certain inputs – plant numbers and agricultural plastics, most notably – {{in order to increase}} marketable yields per acre. At the same time, other inputs – including herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and fertilizers – may be reduced. Three field trials were undertaken in 2003 to evaluate various aspects of the plasticulture system: pumpkin fertigation treatments were evaluated at Al Lansing’s farm in Albany County, and <b>winter</b> <b>squash</b> fertigation and <b>pumpkin</b> and <b>winter</b> <b>squash</b> disease management treatments were evaluated at Cornell’s Valatie farm in Columbia County. At the Lansing farm we evaluated the impact of four nitrogen fertigation rates – 50, 65, 80, and 95 lb N/acre - on pumpkin yields. The number of pumpkins increased with increasing fertilizer rates. At the Valatie farm we evaluated how four rates of nitrogen fertilizer – 30, 45, 60 and 75 lb N/acre - affected the yields of acorn and butternut squashes. The squashes exhibited yield responses only at the highest N rate. Average fruit size was not impacted by these treatments. New, powdery mildew tolerant varieties of squash out-yielded standard varieties even when the newer varieties were given the lowest rates of N and the standards were given the highest N rates. These studies suggest that high yields of acorn and butternut squashes grown using plasticulture techniques may be obtained by selecting good varieties, using high plant populations, and by choosing modest fertilizer rates. In another trial at the Valatie farm we intended to find out how three disease management strategies affected disease incidence, fruit yield, and fruit quality in pumpkins and acorn and butternut squashes. Heavy rains just prior to harvest followed by a rapid Phytophthora infestation destroyed the entire trial making data collection impossible. We expect to repeat this work in 2004...|$|R
40|$|Home {{vegetable}} gardening {{is a popular}} hobby {{for a number of}} reasons. Some people garden for exercise and some for the enjoyment of harvesting flavorful produce that can be eaten fresh from the garden or preserved for use during winter. Others garden so they can grow a wider variety of vegetables than are available at their local grocery store. Finally, in recent years many people are growing vegetables to save money on their grocery bill. Regardless of motive, gardening can be as simple or as complex a project as you make it. However, careful planning can make gardening easier, more productive, and more enjoyable. In planning your garden, {{it is important to consider}} a few basics. 2 ̆ 2 How big should my garden be? 2 ̆ 2 This is an important consideration because a small, weed-free garden will produce more than a larger, poorly maintained garden. Consider how many family members will really help with the garden, or will you handle the hoe alone? Plants such as watermelon, <b>pumpkin</b> and <b>winter</b> <b>squash</b> take up large quantities of garden space. In small gardens the use of compact vegetable cultivars will conserve space and enable gardeners to still plant a greater variety of vegetables. Some vegetables can even be grown in containers, allowing placement near the kitchen door and providing growing room for those without enough space for a vegetable garden. Vegetables and herbs can also be incorporated in ornamental plantings of shrubs, perennials and annuals to create an edible landscape...|$|R
5000|$|A marrow is a vegetable, {{the mature}} fruit of certain Cucurbita pepo cultivars. The {{immature}} {{fruit of the}} same or similar cultivars is called courgette (in Britain, Ireland, France, the Netherlands and New Zealand) or zucchini (in North America, Australia, Germany and Austria). Like courgettes, marrows are oblong, green squash, but marrows have a firm rind and a neutral flavour, making them useful as edible casings for mincemeat and other stuffings. They can be stored for several weeks after harvest (like <b>pumpkins</b> and other <b>winter</b> <b>squash),</b> to be processed for food when required. They are a popular vegetable ("overgrown when picked and insipid when cooked...") in Great Britain and areas with significant British influence, though their popularity is waning in favor of immature summer squash like courgette.Giant marrows are grown competitively in the United Kingdom where the term [...] "marrow" [...] is often restricted to the striped, thick-skinned cultivar.In a culinary context, marrows are treated as a vegetable; usually cooked and presented as a savory dish or accompaniment.

Squash has low seed cost, modest fertility needs, and relatively little labor requirements during the growing season.
