5|$|Fishing {{is quite}} {{popular in the}} lake. The most common species caught is the {{illegally}} introduced carp. Annual monitoring is carried out to determine fish populations. Almost equally as common are the introduced redfin European <b>perch,</b> with these being a regular by catch when fishing for golden <b>perch.</b> However, a number of less common species also inhabit the lake, including native Murray cod, western carp gudgeon and golden <b>perch,</b> as well as introduced goldfish, Gambusia, rainbow trout and brown trout.|$|E
5|$|Introduction of {{non-native}} {{species has}} occurred in many habitats. One of the best studied examples is the introduction of Nile <b>perch</b> into Lake Victoria in the 1960s. Nile <b>perch</b> gradually exterminated the lake's 500 endemic cichlid species. Some of them survive now in captive breeding programmes, but others are probably extinct. Carp, snakeheads, tilapia, European <b>perch,</b> brown trout, rainbow trout, and sea lampreys are other examples of fish that have caused problems by being introduced into alien environments.|$|E

5|$|Males <b>perch</b> after {{emerging}} from their nest. They pick out an area {{close to a}} nest with females inside and guard the territory around it so as {{to have a better}} chance of mating. They tend to <b>perch</b> on many different substrates such as stumps, pebbles, wood, weeds, grass blades and low tree branches. Males assume an alert posture, ready for a challenge from another male, or from a predator. One study by a behavioral ecologist, John Alcock, showed that a large majority of the marked wasps returned to the same <b>perch</b> day after day, and two males swapped between two different sites. The species rarely perches on the ground.|$|E
5|$|When feeding, this flycatcher makes many short {{flights from}} <b>perch</b> to <b>perch,</b> preferring to hunt in shrubs with small leaves, {{particularly}} {{those from the}} genera Adesmia, Baccharis, and Porlieria. A tit-tyrant tends to land near {{the base of the}} shrub and make its way upwards while frequently flicking its tail upwards and shuddering its wings. It has also been observed pivoting on its <b>perch</b> throughout this process. While foraging, the tufted tit-tyrant averages three attacks on prey items per minute. Its feeding style has been compared to that of a kinglet.|$|E
5|$|Native Silver <b>perch</b> and {{introduced}} brown trout were released in 1981–83 and 1987–89 respectively, {{but have not}} been stocked since. Silver <b>perch</b> stockings resulted in almost no captures. Introduced rainbow trout have been released sporadically, approximately once a decade, but have not been released since 2002–04, due to unacceptably low survival rates. According to a government report, {{the reason for the}} low survival rate is unknown, but the dominance of carp in the competition for food is one suggested theory. However, the eutrophic nature and high water temperatures of the lake in summer are more probable reasons. Golden <b>perch</b> and Murray cod have accounted for around four fifths of the released fish in the last three decades and have been the only fish stocked in the last five years. The government plans to stock only these two species for the five years leading up to 2014.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{investigated}} {{the efficiency of}} different kinds of <b>perches</b> in attracting seed disperser-birds and increasing the seed rain in a degraded area located in the northeast region of São Paulo State. We installed seed traps under natural <b>perches</b> (NPs, living trees); simple artificial <b>perches</b> (SAPs) of 3 m tall and a crossbar; elaborate artificial <b>perches</b> (EAPs) of 7 m tall and three crossbars, and in a control area. Results showed the number of bird-dispersed seeds deposited was proportional to the number of structures for <b>perching.</b> The NPs also have provided other resources for birds such as food and shelter. Comparing visitation between artificial <b>perches,</b> there was greater use of EAPs also for having more <b>perching</b> structures and for being taller, providing better airspace visibility for predatory birds and tyrant-flycatchers, important seed dispersers. Thus, natural and artificial <b>perches</b> with similar characteristics to the EAPs are the most recommended as a base or complementary method for the restoration of degraded areas near to propagules source, also contributing to the maintenance of local fauna...|$|R
5|$|Nestling {{birds are}} common prey, being taken more often from nests in trees {{rather than on}} the ground. Grey jays find them by moving from <b>perch</b> to <b>perch</b> and {{scanning}} surroundings. Avian nest predation by grey jays is not necessarily higher in fragmented versus unfragmented forest. Evidence from studies in the Pacific Northwest suggest a moderate increase in nest predation in logged plots adjacent to mature conifer forest, which is the grey jay's preferred habitat. Studies of nest predation by grey jays in Quebec have shown that the birds prefer preying on nests in open forest with high prominence of jack pine, and greater rates of predation in riparian forest strips and green-tree retention stands versus clearcuts. This may be due to increased availability of <b>perch</b> sites for avian predators such as the grey jay. Grey jays are suspected but not proven to prey on nests of the threatened marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) in coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest.|$|E
5|$|Once a male {{has found}} a mate, he selects a territory, marking the {{boundaries}} by warbling as he flies from <b>perch</b> to <b>perch.</b> After circling the perimeter, he performs two flight displays, first repeating a low, flat flight, then flying in an exaggerated version of normal flight, tucking his wings close to his body, plummeting earthwards and catching himself as he spreads his wings to glide upward {{in a series of}} loops. Two or three pairs may group their territories together in a loose colony, perhaps to aid in defense against predators.|$|E
5|$|The {{second most}} {{prevalent}} hunting strategy observed is hover gleaning, {{in which the}} tit-tyrant flies upwards from its <b>perch</b> and then hovers midair while grabbing prey from the vegetation. A third and less frequently used strategy is flycatching, in which the bird flies away from its shrub to grab prey in midair. Prey can be grabbed either close to the bird's <b>perch</b> or at a short distance, which often requires the bird to pursue its prey. When pairs flycatch cooperatively, one bird quietly lurks within the shrub while the other snatches nearby insects; after about a dozen attacks, the birds switch positions.|$|E
40|$|Seed arrival {{is often}} the primary {{limitation}} to forest regeneration in denuded landscapes, {{with the number of}} seeds arriving diminishing rapidly with increase in distance from remnant seed sources. We compared seed rain collected at different distances from the forest edge in seed rain traps with and without introduced bamboo <b>perches</b> in human abandoned agricultural clearings in Bhadra Tiger Reserve. The number of seeds collected per trap below <b>perches</b> was 38 times greater than the number of seeds collected in traps without <b>perches.</b> The species richness of seeds collected per trap below <b>perches</b> was ten-fold greater than in traps without <b>perches.</b> Our study showed that introducing artificial <b>perches</b> is an effective method to improve seed arrival into tree-less habitats, as has been found in studies elsewhere...|$|R
50|$|Front Spring <b>Perches</b> - Some {{owners have}} {{reported}} rust {{problems on the}} front spring <b>perches</b> - the top <b>perches,</b> which hold {{the tops of the}} springs for the front suspension. The <b>perches</b> are spot welded to the chassis, and factory coated in a weatherproof mastic to stop their rusting, however in some rare occurrences, water gets behind the mastic causing the <b>perches</b> to rust and eventually to fail - leading to collapse of the suspension. The car remains controllable. This is a problem that Mercedes USA have acknowledged. The problem is not identifiable without first removing the mastic to check.|$|R

5|$|When a mouse {{or other}} prey is spotted, the kite drops silently onto it, feet-first with wings raised high; {{sometimes}} in one long drop to ground level, {{more often in}} two or more stages, with hovering pauses at intermediate heights. Prey is seized in the talons and about 75% of attacks are successful. Prey can either be eaten in flight or carried back to a <b>perch.</b> Birds will have a favoured feeding <b>perch,</b> beneath which accumulate piles of pellets or castings.|$|E

40|$|Currently, a {{bottleneck}} {{problem for}} battery-powered microflying robots is time of endurance. Inspired by flying animal behavior in nature, an innovative mechanism with active flying and <b>perching</b> in the three-dimensional space was proposed to greatly increase mission life {{and more importantly}} execute tasks <b>perching</b> on an object in the stationary way. In prior work, we have developed some prototypes of flying and <b>perching</b> robots. However, when the robots switch between flying and <b>perching,</b> it is a challenging issue {{to deal with the}} contact between the robot and environment under the traditional position control without considering the stationary obstacle and external force. Therefore, we propose a unified impedance control approach for bioinspired flying and <b>perching</b> robots to smoothly contact with the environment. The dynamic model of the bioinspired robot is deduced, and the proposed impedance control method is employed to control the contact force and displacement with the environment. Simulations including the top <b>perching</b> and side <b>perching</b> and the preliminary experiments were conducted to validate the proposed method. Both simulation and experimental results validate the feasibility of the proposed control methods for controlling a bioinspired flying and <b>perching</b> robot...|$|R

5|$|Like all Australasian robins, {{the flame}} robin is a <b>perch</b> and pounce hunter, mainly eating insects, and often {{returning}} to a favourite low <b>perch</b> several times to stand erect and motionless, scanning the leaf-litter for more prey. They are typically seen in pairs (during {{the spring and summer}} breeding season) or in loose companies in more open country in winter, when they more commonly feed on the ground. A field study in the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales found no significant difference in foraging behaviour between male and female flame robins. Birds have been recorded foraging for insects in furrows in freshly ploughed fields. In Deniliquin, a flame robin was observed holding one foot forward and pattering the ground repeatedly to disturb ground-dwelling insects, and then watching and snapping up any which emerged; this behaviour is otherwise seen in waders.|$|E

5|$|Regular {{stocking}} {{since the}} start of the 1980s have re-established reasonable populations of golden <b>perch</b> and Murray cod; native fish that were indigenous to the Molonglo River before the lake was built, but had been lost to mining pollution of the Molonglo River in the first half of the 20th century. The main reason for stocking is to boost fish stocks along the Molonglo, which have been depleted by overfishing, introduced species and habitat destruction. One of the motives for raising the level of Murray cod and golden <b>perch</b> is to balance the ecosystem by having them act as native predators of other fish.|$|E
