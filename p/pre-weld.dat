Some of the newer applications envisage use of this alloy in very critical high pressure oxygen carrying vessels.

In many cases the weldability of Inconel 718 {{is found to be}} limited by microfissuring phenomenon in the weld heat affected zone. Microfissures are fine intergranular cracks and their severity strongly depends on <b>pre-weld</b> solution treatment temperature (grain size), weld heat input and concentration of impurities (B, P and S) in the base metal.

40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) is a {{solid state}} welding process used widely in the {{manufacturing}} industry, mainly with soft materials with poor fusion weldability such as aluminium. In this investigation the material behaviour of dissimilar friction stir welded 5 XXX and 6 XXX series aluminium alloys was examined. Both alloys are used extensively in the transport industry, however exhibit different properties. 5 XXX series are non-heat treatable, hard alloys with poor cold working ability. In contrast, 6 XXX series are softer, heat treatable alloys with better formability. FSW {{can be used to}} take advantage of these differences in mechanical properties to fuse dissimilar metals.

The high {{usage of}} Al and its alloys {{in both the}} automotive and aerospace industries is attributed to its excellent specific strength and corrosion resistance. High demand of Al usage {{has led to the}} improvement of both the casting techniques and joining processes, in order to improve {{on the quality of the}} final product. The selection of the manufacturing process for Al and its alloys is based on the capabilities of the specified requirements for components and the alloy used. High pressure die casting (HPDC) is the most widely used casting process in the automotive industry due to its high production rate, and ability to produce complex shaped components. However, HPDC is prone to porosity making it difficult to heat treat and weld. Semi solid metal (SSM) forming has the potential to produce near-net-shape components with high integrity. Due to laminar filling characteristics of SSM HPDC, low porosity or porosity free castings can be produced. This offers the opportunity to apply heat treatment as well as weld the SSM HPDC components. A high continuous wave Nd: YAG laser has been used to investigate the weldability of SSM cast A 356 alloy. The CSIR rheo-process was used to prepare the aluminium A 356 SSM slurries and thereafter plates (4 X 80 X 100 mm 3) were cast using a 50 Ton Edgewick HPDC machine.

40|$|Fusion welding {{processes}} cause residual stress {{due to the}} uneven heat distribution produced by the moving welding torch. These residual stresses are characterised by a large tensile component in the welding direction. Due to the self-equilibrated nature of the residual stress, compressive ones {{are present in the}} far field next to the weld seam, which can cause different kind of distortion such as bending or buckling. Welding residual stress can be responsible of premature failure of the components, such as stress crack corrosion, buckling, and reduction of fatigue life. Localised rolling is a stress engineering technique {{that can be used to}} reduce the residual stress and distortion caused by welding. It induces plastic strain in the rolling direction, counteracting the plastic strain produced during welding. In this thesis three techniques were investigated, <b>pre-weld</b> rolling, post-weld rolling, and in situ rolling. These techniques have been seldom studied in the past, particularly <b>pre-weld</b> rolling; consequently the mechanisms are poorly understood. Finite element models allow stress and strain development during both welding and rolling processes to be better understood, providing an improved understanding of the mechanisms involved and aiding process development. A literature survey was done to find the state of the art of the computational welding mechanics simulations, stress management, and the residual stress measurement techniques, as well as the knowledge gaps such as, the thermal losses through the backing-bar in the thermal simulation, the frictional interaction in the rolling process, and the material properties of the steel used in the models. In the literature not many models that investigate the management of welding residual stress were found. After this, the general considerations and assumptions for the welding thermal mechanical models presented in this thesis were discussed. The effect of different backing-bar conditions, as well as different material properties where investigated. Both influenced the residual stress profile to varying degrees. In particular, temperature dependent heat loss to the backing-bar was necessary to capture the improved heat loss near the weld. The distortion predicted by the model was investigated to determine whether it was due to bending or buckling phenomena. Lastly, the temperature distribution and residual stress predictions were validated against thermocouple and neutron diffraction measurements conducted by Coules et al. [1 – 3]. <b>Pre-weld</b> rolling was the first of the three rolling methods considered, in which rolling is applied to the plates before performing GMA butt-welds. The principle behind this technique consisted in inducing tensile residual stress in the weld region before welding; therefore, it is similar to mechanically tensioning the weld, which can significantly reduce the residual stress and distortion. However, there was no significant change in the tensile residual stresses. On the other hand, it was possible to achieve a small reduction in the distortion, when the plates were rolled on the opposite surface to the weld; rolling in this way induced distortion in the opposite direction to the distortion induced by welding, reducing the magnitude of the latter. These results were compared with experiments conducted by Coules et al. [1, 4]. A subsequent investigation combined <b>pre-weld</b> rolling with post-weld heating. With this additional process the residual stress and distortion were significantly reduced, and flatter residual stress profile was achieved. The post-weld rolling and in situ rolling techniques were discussed afterwards. In the post-weld rolling models, rolling was applied after the weldment was cooled to room temperature. In in situ rolling the roller was applied on top of the weld bead at some distance behind the torch, while it was still hot. The principle behind these techniques consisted in applying positive plastic strain to the weld bead region by a roller, counteracting the negative plastic strains produced in the welding process. Two roller profiles were investigated, namely, grooved, and double flat rollers. The post-weld rolling on top of the weld bead models, which used the grooved roller, showed good agreement against experimental results, producing a large reduction of the residual stress and distortion. Some discrepancies were present when the weld toes were rolled with the dual flat roller. The former roller was more efficient for reducing residual stress and distortion. The influence of different friction coefficients (between the roller and weldment, and between the backing-bar and the weldment), were investigated. It showed significant dependency on the residual stress distribution when high rolling loads were used. The frictional interaction constrained the contact area inducing more compressive stress in the core of the weld bead; therefore it produced more tensile residual stress in the surface of the weldment. Additionally, the influence of rolling parameters on the through-thickness residual stress variation was investigated. Low loads only influence the residual stress near the surface, while high loads affected the material through the entire thickness. When the dual flat roller was used to roll next to the weld bead, significant compressive residual stress was induce in the weld bead; however, the residual stress reduction was very sensitive to the contact of the roller to the weld toes; therefore, when rolling a weld bead that varies in shape along the weld, the residual stress reduction is not uniform and varies along the length. On the other hand, the in situ rolling did not produced significant residual stress or distortion reduction in all the cases analysed. The rolling occurred when the material was still hot and the residual stress was subsequently formed as the material cooled to room temperature. Numerical modelling was a very useful tool for understanding the development of stress and plastic strain during the welding and rolling processes...|$|E
40|$|Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a {{suitable}} technology for aerospace structure development {{and is a}} possible replacement for mechanical fastening. To achieve the application of FSW, pre and post-weld treatments are required. A <b>pre-weld</b> treatment of surface preparation was required to ensure a weld with good mechanical properties. The surface preparation necessary is the removal of paint and anodising layers from aerospace alloys. Laser paint removal was assessed and designed to remove these layers with only an oxide remaining, which welded to produce high quality welds. The post-weld treatment was essential to increase the corrosion resistance of the welded area. The improvement in corrosion resistance was achieved with High Power Beam Surface Modification (HPBSM), which created a homogeneous surface through rapid surface melting and solidification.

The materials under investigation were 1. 6 mm thick sheet 6013, 2024 and 7475 alloys, representing the major medium and high strength heat treatable aluminium groups used in the aerospace industry. Initial experimentation generated procedures relating to specimen and equipment <b>pre-weld</b> preparation. Bead on plate and square butt joint trials were performed in the downhand position. The plasma keyhole mode was operated autogenously while filler wire addition was employed for the melt-in mode. Arc monitoring techniques were used to log the arc voltage and welding current values. The effect of background and control parameters on process performance and joint quality was studied and used to generate operating envelopes and reveal optimum welding conditions. Geometrical data from the melt-in joints of all alloys were employed to build joint geometry prediction statistical models. Numerical algorithms, based on the information generated by the statistical models, were used to create joint geometry optimisation techniques. Calorimetric experiments and x-ray examination of joints revealed the relationship between major operating parameters and arc efficiency and the incidence of porosity, suggesting desired welding conditions that were incorporated in the optimisation process.

40|$|A {{method of}} heat {{treatment}} {{has been developed}} to reverse some of the deleterious effects of friction stir welding of plates of aluminum alloy 7050. This alloy is considered unweldable by arc and high-energy-density beam fusion welding processes. The alloy can be friction stir welded, but as-welded workpieces exhibit low ductility, low tensile and yield strengths, and low resistance to stress corrosion cracking. Heat treatment according to the present method increases tensile and yield strengths, and minimizes or eliminates stress corrosion cracking. It also increases ductility. This method of heat treatment is a superior alternative to a specification-required heat treatment that caused the formation of large columnar grains, which are undesired. Workpieces subjected to the prior heat treatment exhibited elongations < 2 percent, and standard three-point bend specimens shattered. The development of the present heat treatment method was guided partly by the principles that (1) by minimizing grain sizes and relieving deformation stresses, one can minimize or eliminate stress corrosion cracking and (2) the key to maximizing strength and eliminating residual stresses is to perform post-weld solution heating for as long a time as possible while incurring little or no development of large columnar grains in friction stir weld nuggets. It is necessary to perform some of the solution heat treatment (to soften the alloy and improve machine welding parameters) before welding. The following {{is an example of}} thickness- dependent pre- and post-weld heat treatments according to the present method: For plates 0. 270 in. (approx. 6. 86 mm) thick milled from plates 4. 5 in.

Despite of other ways of welding (hotplate welding, friction stir welding, plasma welding, electric welding) ultrasonic welding is clean, reliable, consistent and affordable process. It needs no <b>pre-weld</b> or post-weld operations, it uses no consumables of any nature, it is user and environment friendly and it is rapid, repeatable process. Invariably, ultrasonic assembly weld times are less than one second, far less than moulding times. Moreover the consumption of energy is perhaps the lowest by any other process. The power delivered to welder has to treated very carefully and the project of ultrasonic generator is strictly connected with the mechanical configuration of welder. Ultrasonic generator must stress only the resonance frequency of piezoelectric transducer {{that is the first}} electromechanical component that converts electrical energy to mechanical one. Ultrasonic transducer has to be connected to generator in order to receive the maximum power generated. A number of different matching circuits that allow the maximum efficency coupling are studied. One of this, ”L” matching circuit, is the best solution for ultrasonic welders. This thesis collects a number of measures taken of ultrasonic welder machine available at DTG (Department of Management and Engineering) of University of Padova. This measures are useful to understand how the generator work and the general control scheme for ultrasonic welders. Usually we have to keep systems far from resonance point: this control must to maintain the mechanics system in resonance to maximize the electromechanical power conversion from piezoelectric transducer to welding point. This can be possible with PLL control and maximum seeking control algorithms.

The position control was carried out by <b>pre-weld</b> adjusting the initial position of the workpiece using a wire touch sensor and on-line adjusting the torch-to-workpiece distance by moving the workpiece based on the information provided by a through-the-arc sensor. The process control was carried out by automatically trimming the welding voltage such that the most stable process could be obtained. The stability of the process was estimated by using previously established monitoring indices. It was assumed that the off-line welding parameter optimization would provide the deposition rate necessary to produce the required weld quality. Successful welding control trials were performed showing the effectiveness of the adaptive control strategy. An off-line programming system has been developed and the programs generated have been tested by simulation. This showed that simulated positioning errors, produced by deliberate wrong path data, were successfully compensated for by the control system developed in this work...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{conservative}} assumption of residual stress in highly restrained steel structures {{can lead to}} unnecessary repairs of defects in welded joints. This applies {{particularly with respect to}} high restraint, high yield strength thick sections welds because the assumption of yield strength residual stress is used in integrity assessments. By analysing the stress within components both before and after welding it is anticipated that a greater understanding of the residual stress field as a product of both the welding residual stress and the <b>pre-welding</b> residual stress can be made. This paper discusses a series of experiments designed to build up such a model of the changing stress field within a T-butt weld. Neutron strain scanning has been performed on unwelded flat and curved steel sections and a curved T-butt weld. To complement this, surface X-ray measurements have been carried out in order to gain a quantitative measure of the changing surface stress during welding and sectioning. The findings were that welding stresses dominate close to the weld, bending stresses dominate further from the weld...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Welding of {{pyroclastic}} deposits involves flat-tening of glassy pyroclasts under a compactional load {{at temperatures}} above the glass transition temperature. Pro-gressive welding is recorded {{by changes in}} the petro-graphic (e. g., fabric) and physical (e. g., density) proper-ties of the deposits. Mapping the intensity of welding can be integral to studies of pyroclastic deposits, but making systematic comparisons between deposits can be prob-lematical. Here we develop a scheme for ranking welding intensity in pyroclastic deposits {{on the basis of}} petro-graphic textural observations (e. g., oblateness of pumice lapilli and micro-fabric orientation) and measurements of physical properties, including density, porosity, point load strength and uniaxial compressive strength. Our dataset comprises measurements on 100 samples collected from a single cooling unit of the Bandelier Tuff and parallel measurements on 8 samples of more densely welded de-posits. The proposed classification comprises six ranks of welding intensity ranging from unconsolidated (Rank I) to obsidian-like vitrophyre (Rank VI) and should allow for reproducible mapping of subtle variations in welding in-tensity between different deposits. The application of the ranking scheme is demonstrated by using published physical property data on welded pyroclastic deposits to map the total accumulated strain and to reconstruct their <b>pre-welding</b> thicknesses...|$|R
40|$|A recent {{development}} in {{sheet metal forming}} industry is the application of tailored blanks: blanks prepared from separate pieces of sheet material, welded together prior to the forming process. The pieces of sheet material can have different properties, enabling weight reduction of components, corrosion resistance using cathodic protection or the possibility to create local weak spots, resulting in well defined deformation zones {{in the event of}} an accident (e. g. crash zones in automotive applications). However, a major draw back in the utilisation of these <b>pre-welded</b> or tailored blanks is that the weld between the pieces of sheet exhibits increased hardness and roughness, leading to possible abrasive wear of the sheet metal forming tool [1]. In this work a model is developed describing the abrasive wear of deep drawing dies caused by the application of tailored blanks. Many surface contact models are based on the assumption that surfaces are composed of a collection of small asperities of which the tips are equally sized and spherically shaped and have some kind of statistical height distribution. This approach w as used in 1966 by Greenwood and Williamson [2] and was successfully followed by many researchers during the following decades. The statistical representation of surface topography enables calculation of contact forces and asperity deformations with reasonable accuracy using well-established equations. Although this approach ha...|$|R
