5000|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of concussions {{can be hard to}} determine because they may not present strongly and because they may not present for several hours after the incident has occurred. There are 4 categories that symptoms of a concussion can be classified within: physical, cognitive, emotional and sleep disturbance. [...] The most common symptom is a headache as well as the feeling of being “fog like”. Other, more subtle symptoms that can accompany headaches are emotional changes, irritability, slowed reaction times and drowsiness. [...] Accompanying symptoms can include sensitivity to light, and noise, fatigue, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. The loss of consciousness is another identifiable characteristic of concussions {{but it is not a}} required symptom to diagnose it. The loss of consciousness occurs in only 10% of concussions, so it cannot be a reliable sign of a concussion. [...] Other distinguishing characteristics of concussions are retrograde amnesia (loss of memory just prior to injury) and <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>amnesia</b> (impaired recall of time between the injury or resumption of consciousness and the point at which new memories are stored and retrieved).|$|E
5000|$|Researchers have {{investigated}} the relationship between <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>amnesia</b> (PTA) resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI) {{and the development of}} symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and acute stress disorder (ASD). 282 outpatients, who were an average of 53 days post-TBI in their recovery, were divided into 4 groups: PTA episode lasting less than 1 hour; PTA episode lasting between 1 hour and 24 hours; PTA episode lasting between 24 hours and one week; and PTA episode lasting for longer than one week. The patients' personal details were used as variables classified for age, gender, marital status, time elapsed between injury and assessment, and type of injury (motor vehicle accident, pedestrian, assault and other). Patients were given two self-report inventories: the Impact of Event Scale (IES) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). The IES measures symptoms of PTSD and contains questions regarding the intrusiveness of the traumatic event (ex. nightmares) and avoidant behaviours related to the traumatic event (ex. avoiding a certain location). [...] The GHQ was used as an indicator of overall psychological health. The majority of subjects were in Group 1 (PTA episode lasting less than 1 hour), injured in motor vehicle accidents, and male.|$|E

40|$|Objective: This is {{the second}} part of a study of <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>amnesia</b> in World War I (WW I) soldiers. It moves beyond {{diagnostic}} validation of <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>amnesia</b> (PTA), to examine treatment findings, and relates these to contemporary treatment of dissociative amnesia, including treatment of victims of civilian trauma (e. g. childhood sexual abuse). Method: Key WW I studies are surveyed which focus on the treatment of PTA and traumatic memories, The dissociation-integration and repression-abreaction models are contrasted. Results: Descriptive evidence is cited in support of preferring Myers ' and McDougalls ' dissociation-integration treatment approach over Brown's repres-sion-abreaction model.

40|$|Introduction: There is {{evidence}} that the e 4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is detrimental to cognitive function, but results from traumatic brain injury (TBI) populations are mixed. A possible explanation is that APOEe 2 carriers have routinely been incorporated into APOEe 4 and non-e 4 groups, despite APOEe 2 being proposed to have an ameliorative effect. Our primary aim was to investigate the influence of APOEe 4 on cognitive impairment during early recovery following TBI, excluding the potential confound of APOEe 2 possession. A secondary objective was to explore whether APOEe 4 displays more pronounced effects in moderate to severe TBI and to consider the potential postinjury protective influence of the APOEe 2 allele. Method: Participants who recently sustained a TBI (<b>posttraumatic</b> <b>amnesia</b> > 5 minutes) were assessed on measures of information processing speed, executive function, and working memory upon remission of <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>amnesia.</b> APOE genotype was determined by buccal saliva DNA extraction (APOEe 4 n = 37, APOEe 3 n = 92, APOEe 2 n = 13). Results: Stepwise multiple regressions were performed to compare APOEe 4 carriers to APOEe 3 homozygotes, with injury severity, age, and estimated premorbid IQ included in the first step. This model was found to significantly predict performance on all tasks, accounting for 17. 3 – 24. 3 % of the variance. When APOEe 4 status was added for the second step, there were no significant changes on any tasks (additional variance < 1 %). The effect of APOEe 4 in moderate to severe TBI and the effect of APOEe 2 were explored by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with no significant effects revealed. Conclusions: It is unlikely that APOE genotype influences cognitive function in the initial recovery period following TBI, regardless of injury severity. However, a more nuanced and long-term exploration of the effect of APOE genotype in the TBI population is warranted...|$|E

Tasks allowed assessment of these with experimental or statistical control for the individual speed of information processing. This precaution appears necessary because slow information processing is a pervasive effect of CHI and may cause spurious effects on complex cognitive tasks under time pressure. Strong effects of CHI were shown on speed of information processing. Controlling this factor, central executive aspects of attention were normal, on average. A tentative analysis of the results in relation to severity indicated that less severely injured patients are better in this respect than controls, and more severely injured patients are worse.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to identify the clinical, neuropsychological, neuropsychiatric, and functional variables that correlate with metacognitive self-awareness (SA) in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) outpatients and to assess the influence of the same variables on the sensory-motor, cognitive, and behavioral-affective indicators of SA. This cross-sectional observational study evaluated 37 outpatients from May 2006 to June 2007 in a neurorehabilitation hospital on the basis of the following inclusion criteria: (1) age 15 years; (2) diagnosis of severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale, GCS 8); (3) <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>amnesia</b> (PTA) resolution; (4) capacity to undergo formal psychometric evaluation despite cognitive and sensory-motor deficits; (5) absence of aphasia; (6) availability of informed consent. A neuropsychological battery was used to evaluate attention, memory, and executive functions. SA was assessed by the awareness questionnaire (AQ), administered to both patients and relatives. Decreased metacognitive self-awareness is significantly correlated with increased problems in some components of executive system, even when the AQ subscales were considered separately. The significant correlation found between some components of executive system and metacognitive self-awareness confirmed the importance of addressing this issue to treat SA contextually in the rehabilitation of executive functions...|$|E
40|$|Importance Whether {{traumatic}} brain injury (TBI) is {{a risk factor for}} posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been difficult to determine because of the prevalence of comorbid conditions, overlapping symptoms, and cross-sectional samples. OBJECTIVE To examine the extent to which self-reported predeployment and deployment-related TBI confers increased risk of PTSD when accounting for combat intensity and predeployment mental health symptoms. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS As part of the prospective, longitudinal Marine Resiliency Study (June 2008 to May 2012), structured clinical interviews and self-report assessments were administered approximately 1 month before a 7 -month deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan and again 3 to 6 months after deployment. The study was conducted at training areas on a Marine Corps base in southern California or at Veterans Affairs San Diego Medical Center. Participants for the final analytic sample were 1648 active-duty Marine and Navy servicemen who completed predeployment and postdeployment assessments. Reasons for exclusions were nondeployment (n = 34), missing data (n = 181), and rank of noncommissioned and commissioned officers (n = 66). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomewas the total score on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) 3 months after deployment. RESULTS At the predeployment assessment, 56. 8 %of the participants reported prior TBI; at postdeployment assessment, 19. 8 %reported sustaining TBI between predeployment and postdeployment assessments (ie, deployment-related TBI). Approximately 87. 2 %of deployment-related TBIs were mild; 250 of 287 participants (87. 1 %) who reported <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>amnesia</b> reported less than 24 hours of <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>amnesia</b> (37 reported - 24 hours), and 111 of 117 of those who lost consciousness (94. 9 %) reported less than 30 minutes of unconsciousness. Predeployment CAPS score and combat intensity score raised predicted 3 -month postdeployment CAPS scores by factors of 1. 02 (P <. 001; 95 %CI, 1. 02 - 1. 02) and 1. 02 (P <. 001; 95 %CI, 1. 01 - 1. 02) per unit increase, respectively. Deployment-related mild TBI raised predicted CAPS scores by a factor of 1. 23 (P <. 001; 95 % CI, 1. 11 - 1. 36), and moderate/severe TBI raised predicted scores by a factor of 1. 71 (P <. 001; 95 %CI, 1. 37 - 2. 12). Probability of PTSD was highest for participants with severe predeployment symptoms, high combat intensity, and deployment-related TBI. Traumatic brain injury doubled or nearly doubled the PTSD rates for participants with less severe predeployment PTSD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Even when accounting for predeployment symptoms, prior TBI, and combat intensity, TBI during the most recent deployment is the strongest predictor of postdeployment PTSD symptoms.

40|$|OBJECTIVE:: To {{examine the}} {{influence}} of self-reported preinjury coping on postinjury coping, psychosocial functioning, emotional functioning, {{and quality of life}} at 1 year following traumatic brain injury (TBI). SETTING:: Inpatient hospital and community. PARTICIPANTS:: One hundred seventy-four participants with TBI. DESIGN:: Prospective, longitudinal design. Participants were assessed at 5 time points: after emerging from <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>amnesia,</b> and at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months postinjury. MAIN MEASURES:: Coping Scale for Adults-Short Version; Quality of Life Inventory; Sydney Psychosocial Reintegration Scale; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS:: High preinjury use of nonproductive coping style predicted high use of nonproductive coping, more anxiety, and lower psychosocial functioning at 1 year postinjury. Increased use of nonproductive coping and decreased use of productive coping predicted poorer psychosocial outcome at 1 year post-TBI. Use of both productive and nonproductive coping decreased in the first 6 to 12 months post-TBI relative to preinjury. Unlike productive coping, nonproductive coping reached preinjury levels within 3 years postinjury. CONCLUSION:: The findings support identification of individuals at risk of relying on nonproductive coping and poorer psychosocial outcome following TBI. In addition, the results emphasize the need to implement timely interventions to facilitate productive coping and reduce the use of nonproductive coping in order to maximize favorable long-term psychosocial outcome...|$|E
40|$|<b>Posttraumatic</b> <b>amnesia</b> (PTA) is {{a common}} symptom {{following}} traumatic brain injury. Although this transient memory deficit implies specific impairment of higher brain function, the actual pathophysiology of PTA is not well understood. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess regional cerebral hemodynamics with perfusion computed tomography (CT) in patients during PTA following mild head injury compared to patients with resolved PTA. A total of 74 patients with mild head injury without structural abnormalities on a non-contrast CT scan were included and compared to 25 healthy controls. Two patient groups were defined: (1) a PTA group that was scanned during the episode of PTA (n = 34), and (2) a post-PTA group scanned after resolution of PTA (n = 40). The PTA group had significantly reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the frontal grey matter (41. 78 [SD 7. 4] versus 44. 44 [SD 6. 2] mL. 100 g(- 1). min(- 1), p = 0. 023), and caudate nucleus (44. 59 [SD 6. 2] versus 47. 85 [SD 7. 7] mL. 100 g(- 1). min(- 1), p = 0. 021), compared to the post-PTA group.

Ten years after injury 4 % were totally disabled, and 14 % severely disabled to a degree precluding normal occupational or social life. Of the remainder, 49 % had recovered, and the rest were dead. Additionally, a selected series of 64 patients whose unconsciousness had been prolonged for a month or more were studied. Forty of these had survived between three and 25 years after injury and were re-examined. On the basis of age at injury, the worst state of neurological responsiveness, and the duration of <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>amnesia,</b> the outcome of head injury can be predicted reliably in most cases.

40|$|There remains much unknown {{about how}} {{large-scale}} neural networks accommodate neurological disruption, such as moderate and severe {{traumatic brain injury}} (TBI). A primary goal {{in this study was}} to examine the alterations in network topology occurring during the first year of recovery following TBI. To do so we examined 21 individuals with moderate and severe TBI at 3 and 6 months after resolution of <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>amnesia</b> and 15 age- and education-matched healthy adults using functional MRI and graph theoretical analyses. There were two central hypotheses in this study: 1) physical disruption results in increased functional connectivity, or hyperconnectivity, and 2) hyperconnectivity occurs in regions typically observed to be the most highly connected cortical hubs, or the "rich club". The current findings generally support the hyperconnectivity hypothesis showing that during the first year of recovery after TBI, neural networks show increased connectivity, and this change is disproportionately represented in brain regions belonging to the brain's core subnetworks. The selective increases in connectivity observed here are consistent with the preferential attachment model underlying scale-free network development. This study is the largest of its kind and provides the unique opportunity to examine how neural systems adapt to significant neurological disruption during the first year after injury...|$|E
40|$|Survivors of moderate-severe Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) are at {{risk for}} {{long-term}} cognitive, emotional, and behavioural problems. This prospective cohort study investigated self-reported executive, emotional, and behavioural problems in the late chronic phase of moderate and severe TBI, if demographic characteristics (i. e., age, years of education), injury characteristics (Glasgow Coma Scale score, MRI findings such as traumatic axonal injury (TAI), or duration of <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>amnesia),</b> symptoms of depression, or neuropsychological variables in the first year after injury predicted long-term self-reported function. Self-reported executive, emotional, and behavioural functioning were assessed among individuals with moderate and severe TBI (N= 67, age range 15 – 65 years at time of injury) 2 – 5 years after TBI, compared to a healthy matched control group (N= 72). Results revealed significantly more attentional, emotional regulation, and psychological difficulties in the TBI group than controls. Demographic and early clinical variables were associated with poorer cognitive and emotional outcome. Fewer years of education and depressive symptoms predicted greater executive dysfunction. Younger age at injury predicted more aggressive and rule-breaking behaviour. TAI and depressive symptoms predicted Internalizing problems and greater executive dysfunction. In conclusion, age, education, TAI, and depression appear to elevate risk for poor long-term outcome, emphasising the need for long-term follow-up of patients presenting with risk factors...|$|E
40|$|The {{high rate}} of blast {{exposures}} experienced by U.

Dizziness and postural instability can persist after mTBI {{as a component of}} postconcussion syndrome, but also occur among the somatic complaints of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The goals of this study were to examine the use of computerized posturography testing (CPT) to objectively characterize chronic balance deficits after mTBI and to explore the utility of CPT in distinguishing between combat and blast-exposed participants with and without mTBI and PTSD. Data were analyzed from a subject pool of 166 combat-exposed SMs and Veterans who had a blast experience within the past 2 yr while deployed. Using nonparametric tests and measures of impairment, we found that balance was deficient in participants diagnosed with mTBI with <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>amnesia</b> (PTA) or PTSD versus those with neither and that deficits were amplified for participants with both diagnoses. In addition, unique deficiencies were found using CPT for individuals having isolated mTBI with PTA and isolated PTSD.

Inappropriate social behavior (33. 3 %), aggression (31. 9 %), and adynamia (23. 1 %) were the 3 most common individual behaviors, with 35. 5 % of the sample displaying more than 1 challenging behavior. Significant associations were found between increasing levels of challenging behavior and longer duration of <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>amnesia,</b> increasing functional disability, greater restrictions in participation, increased support needs, and greater degrees of psychiatric disturbance, respectively (P < 0. 004). Multivariate binomial logistic regression found that premorbid alcohol abuse, postinjury restrictions in participation, {{and higher levels of}} postinjury psychiatric disturbance were independent predictors of challenging behavior. Conclusions: Challenging behaviors are widespread among community-dwelling adults with severe traumatic brain injury. Services need to deliver integrated anger management, social skills, and motivational treatments. 12 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{symptoms}} of postconcussion syndrome (PCS) are persistent, and no empirically tested treatment is available. The treatment group (n = 29) {{in this study}} received a printed manual and met with a therapist prior to hospital discharge to review the nature and incidence of expected symptoms, the cognitive-behavioral model of symptom maintenance and treatment, techniques for reducing symptoms, and instructions for gradual resumption of premorbid activities. The control group (n = 29) received routine hospital treatment and discharge instructions. Both groups had sustained mild head injuries characterized by Glascow Coma Scale scores of 13 – 15 on admission without any measurable period of <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>amnesia.</b> Group assignment was random. Groups {{did not differ significantly}} on age, Glascow scores, litigation status, gender, or initial number of PCS symptoms. Patients were contacted 6 months following injury by an interviewer who was unaware of group assignment to obtain outcome data. Treated patients reported significantly shorter average symptom duration (33 vs. 51 days) and significantly fewer of the 12 symptoms at followup (1. 6 vs. 3. 1). Subjects were also asked how often each symptom had occurred in the previous week, and how severe the symptom typically was. The treatment group experienced significantly fewer symptomatic days (. 5 vs. 1. 3) and lower mean severity levels. Results suggest that brief, early psychological intervention can reduce the incidence of PCS...|$|E
40|$|Severe head {{injuries}} {{often lead to}} serious medical and socioeconomic sequelae. The incidence rate indicated in other studies shows a wide variation {{due to differences in}} selection criteria. Based upon an unselected population, the incidence of severe head injury was calculated and the surviving patients were interviewed and clinically examined 3 years after the accident in order to describe the course, rehabilitation and psychosocial sequelae after severe head injury. Retrospectively we collected 80 patients living in the canton of St. Gallen who had a severe head injury requiring hospitalization in 1987, indicating an incidence of 20 per 100, 000 inhabitants. 22 (28 %) of these patients died {{as a consequence of the}} head trauma. The best predictor was the Glasgow coma score at admission, which showed a highly significant direct correlation with survival rate. Regarding the degree of impairment of survivors the duration of <b>posttraumatic</b> <b>amnesia</b> was the best predictive parameter. Of the 45 patients controlled 3 years after the head trauma only 11 % were severely impaired in daily activities. 79 % of the patients who were gainfully employed before the accident were working full- or at least part-time. However, only 3 patients (7 %) were absolutely free of symptoms. Most patients suffered from cognitive and emotional deficits. Based on an estimated incidence for minor head trauma of 174 per 100, 000 inhabitants, a total annual incidence for all head traumas of 194 per 100, 000 inhabitants is calculated, with severe head injury representing about 1 / 9 of all {{head injuries}}...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{ability to}} see things from another's perspective, that is, have a theory of mind (ToM), is {{essential}} to effective communication. So too {{is the ability to}} regulate verbal output, that is, to exercise executive control. People with traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) have impaired communication abilities, but the extent to which this reflects ToM versus executive dysfunction is unclear. This study explored the relative contributions of executive abilities, specifically flexibility and inhibition and ToM abilities in language production post-TBI. Method: Twenty-five adults (18 males: mean age of 48. 2 years, SD = 12. 0 years) with moderate to severe TBI (<b>posttraumatic</b> <b>amnesia</b> = 69. 2, SD = 54. 6 days) and 28 noninjured adults (19 males: mean age 49. 0, SD = 12. 2 years) completed three sets of communication tasks with low executive demands, high flexibility, and high inhibition demands. Within each, parallel versions had low or high ToM requirements. Results: For low executive and high flexibility tasks, scores on the high ToM versions were predicted by scores on the low ToM versions, suggesting that poor performance was explained by the executive demands the parallel tasks had in common. The exception was the high inhibition task. In this case, speakers with TBI had differential difficulty with the high ToM version, that is, they had specific difficulty inhibiting self-referential thoughts in order to cater for another's perspective. Conclusion: We found problems with inhibiting the self-perspective accords with descriptive accounts of the egocentric nature of some communication patterns following TBI, which points to potential targets for remediation. © 2014 American Psychological Association...|$|E
