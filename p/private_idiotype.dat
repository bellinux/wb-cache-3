40|$|In {{this paper}} we will {{summarize}} {{some of our}} recent studies on the anti-p-azophenylarsonate (anti-Ar) antibodies of strain-A mice. The work to be discussed includes structural studies of anti-bodies with shared idiotype. Investigations relating to the immunosuppression f the cross-reactive idiotype and to the "private " idiotypes of anti-Ar antibodies arising in immunosuppressed immunized mice will also be included. Among the new data to be presented here are those based on the adoptive transfer of idiotypes, using leukocytes from ascitic fluids, rather than spleen cells; mice that are suppressed {{with respect to a}} cross-reactive idiotype, but which express a <b>private</b> <b>idiotype,</b> are the donors in these experiments. We will also present data o...|$|E
40|$|Rabbit {{anti-idiotypic}} reagents {{were prepared}} against three different human serum autoantibodies to thyroglobulin (Tg). Two of the rabbit antisera recognized private idiotypes (IdI) whilst a third antiserum recognized both an IdI and a cross-reactive idiotype (IdX) which was expressed in 50 % of Hashimoto patients tested. A fourth anti-idiotype was produced against an IgM anti-Tg secreted by a patient's Epstein-Barr (EB) virus transformed lymphocytes. This antiserum only reacted with the immunizing IgM anti-Tg and therefore also recognized a <b>private</b> <b>idiotype.</b> Both {{the private and}} the public idiotypes appear to be restricted to the anti-Tg set of antibodies; this would favour {{the view that the}} IdX represents a collection of idotopes with the ability to bind Tg as their common feature, rather than a common structure based upon closely similar germ line derived amino acid sequences...|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} basis of immunoglobulin idiotypes (1) has been pursued in several well-defined antibody systems (2 - 7). The accumulated results {{have suggested that}} the hypervariable regions (complementarity-determining regions, CDR) 1 of the light and heavy polypeptide chains usually contribute to the formation of idiotypic determinants. In the extensively analyzed murine antidextran model, one <b>private</b> <b>idiotype</b> and one public idiotype (cross-reactive idiotypes, CRI) were assigned, respectively to the third and the second hypervariable regions of the heavy chain (6). In most other cases, idiotypic determinants have not been associated definitively with a specific amino acid sequence (2). The latter result is not surprising, considering that antiidiotype antibodies elicited by immunization with intact immunoglobulin often recognize determinants dependent upon a particular quaternary interaction of the light and heavy chains (2). Using carefully absorbed rabbit antisera, Kunkel and colleagues (8) first described the unusual existence of two major CRI (Wa and Po) among huma...|$|E
40|$|Rabbit {{anti-idiotypic}} antibodies {{were prepared}} against affinity purified autoantibodies to the ribonucleoprotein La (SS-B) antigen from the sera of three unrelated patients. Each anti-idiotype recognized <b>private</b> <b>idiotypes</b> expressed {{only on the}} immunizing anti-La antibody. In each case they were conformationally dependent and related to the antigen binding site. This demonstration of immunodominant <b>private</b> <b>idiotypes</b> on human autoantibodies to ribonucleoproteins is in direct contrast to the cross-reactive idiotypes described on rheumatoid factors and autoantibodies to DNA. We discuss the possibility that anti-La antibodies, unlike anti-DNA, arise {{as a result of}} autoantigenic stimulation...|$|R
40|$|This study characterizes four <b>private</b> <b>idiotypes</b> (Id) {{associated}} with monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to simian virus 40 (SV 40) tumor antigen (T- Ag), {{and to a}} cellular protein, p 53. Anti-Id recognized Id determinants {{associated with}} the antibody-combining site. BALB/c mice receiving a pool of anti-Id directed against mAb recognizing distinct amino and carboxyl terminal epitopes of T-Ag before receiving a tumorigenic dose of SV 40 -transformed cells showed suppression of tumor formation. Serum obtained from these mice before tumor challenge contained anti-anti-Id that failed to bind T-Ag. These data support the potential role of regulatory idiotopes in tumor immunity...|$|R
40|$|It is now {{evident that}} most {{if not all}} major intrastrain crossreactive idiotypes (CRI) I result from the {{expression}} of unmutated germline genes or germline genes that have undergone a moderate degree of somatic mutation (1 - 1 1). The association with germline genes can account for the ubiquitous presence of such idiotypes within a strain (12), as contrasted with <b>private</b> <b>idiotypes,</b> which may be the products of highly mutated genes (13). In general, {{there appears to be no}} restriction of expression of heavy chain isotype in CRIs. This includes the expression of IgE, which has been identified in CRI-bearing antibodies with specificities for GAT (14, 15), Ars (16), and PC (17). The number of somatic mutations expressed in CRI + antibodies increases with time after immunization. For example, in the phenyloxazolone system, mAb prepared with spleens taken 1 wk after primary immunization reflect very few mutations, whereas mutations are frequent 1 wk later (18, 19). In the PC system, mutations are much more common in IgG or IgA than in IgM mAb bearing th...|$|R
40|$|BALB/c mice were immunized {{with a human}} gamma 2 k paraprotein and hybridomas {{prepared}} by the Kohler & Milstein technique. Ten hybridoma clones producing high levels of antibody competed reacting specificity with the immunogen were isolated. Six of the monoclonal antibodies competed strongly {{with each other for}} sites on the antigen. In reverse passive haemagglutination tests immunoglobulins reacting with the antibodies were not detectable in normal or pathological sera. Polyclonal antisera to two of the monoclonal antibodies were prepared in rabbits; they were rendered specific by adsorption with Sepharose-normal mouse IgG and tested against the other monoclonal antibodies. A weak cross-reaction of one of the mouse antibodies with the immunogen was observed with one antiserum but none with the other. Furthermore, no repetition of the idiotypes of the two immunogens was observed in polyclonal responses of BALB/c mice immunized with the same paraprotein antigen. These results with monoclonal antibodies confirm those obtained with polyclonal antisera in showing that the antibody response of one species to the <b>private</b> <b>idiotype</b> determinants of an immunoglobulin of another species is highly heterogeneous...|$|E
40|$|Model {{experiments}} using anti HLA monoclonal antibodies {{were performed}} to apply the immune response of anti-idiotypic antibodies to immunotherapy since anti-idiotypic antibodies are {{of interest in the}} investigation of a new immunomodulator for cancer patients. Polyclonal anti-idiotypic antisera and anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibodies induced with anti HLA-A 2. A 28 monoclonal antibody KS 1 in a syngeneic system recognized the <b>private</b> <b>idiotype</b> on monoclonal amtibody KS 1. Idiotype mapping of monoclonal antibody ES 1 showed that there might be at least four idiotopes on it; two idiotopes at a combining site and another at an intermediate site. The four diffrerent anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibodies might induce anti-anti-idiotypic antibodies specific to their immunized anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody in the syngeneic system. One of the anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibodies against the idiotope at the combining site of monoclonal antibody KS 1 could induce an anti-anti-idiotypic antibody which might have the same reactivity as that of monoclonal antibody KS 1 to HLA-A 2. A 28 antigen. The results suggest that an anti-idiotypic antibody bearing the internal image of a tumor associated antigen may induce the anti-anti-idiotypic antibodies specific to the tumor associated antigen and therefore may be useful for cancer therapy...|$|E
40|$|Over {{a period}} of {{approximately}} 1 year, the immunoreactivity of the anti-ovary carcinoma MAb MOv 18 was evaluated after radiolabelling with 125 I on two different ovarian carcinoma cell lines, OvCa 432 and IGROV 1. A high variability of the immunoreactive values was observed by analysing different preparations of radiolabelled MOv 18 (from 12 to 21 % on OvCa 432 and from 22 to 56 % on IGROV 1) and by using the same radiolabelled preparation (12 % on OvCa 432 and 51 % on IGROV 1). Since the variability {{could be due to}} the target cells, we set up an alternative binding assay using the anti-idiotypic MAb anti-Id 18. 1 directed against a <b>private</b> <b>idiotype</b> closely associated with the MOv 18 paratope. Three different experiments carried out with the anti-idiotypic MAb gave reproducible results with an immunoreactive range from 71 to 83 %. A direct comparison between the reactivity of the same 125 I-MOv 18 preparation on anti-Id 18. 1 and on IGROV 1 confirmed the higher value of the immunoreactive fraction estimated on the more homogeneous anti-idiotypic reagent (71 %), rather than on the tumour cells (56 %). These data suggest that anti-idiotypic MAbs could represent suitable reagents for the evaluation of the immunoreactivity of an antibody preparation after radiolabelling and before in vivo administration...|$|E
40|$|Since {{their first}} {{description}} over 20 years ago, idiotypes {{have been used}} extensively to study {{various aspects of the}} immune system (1, 2). Idiotypes, antigenic determinants associated with immunoglobulin-variable regions, have been found on VH and VL regions, or both (3 - 11), and have been localized to both antigen-binding and framework regions (12 - 17). Those idiotypes shared by immunoglobulins known to be structurally different are designated IdX, 1 cross-reactive or public idiotypes, whereas those apparently restricted to one or a few closely related types of molecules are designated IdI, individual or <b>private</b> <b>idiotypes.</b> In spite of these general descriptive associations, the molecular bases for idiotypes have not been precisely defined. This lack of molecular correlation stands in striking contrast to the precise structural correlations for the constant region allotypes of rabbit and human immunoglobulins where allotype-positive and-negative proteins differ by only one or a few amino acid residues. Closely related sets of structurally defined idiotype-positive and-negative proteins have not previously been described. As part of an examination of the murine repertoire of anti-a-(1 ~ 3) dextra...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of the putative T cell antigen receptor has been defined using monoclonal antibodies (mAb) 1 prepared against various monoclonal T cell populations in several laboratories (1 - 3), including our own (4, 5). These reagents have defined an 80 - 90 kilodalton (kD) disulfide-linked heterodimer usually composed of a 49 - 53 kD alpha chain of acidic pI and a 41 - 43 kD beta chain of more basic pI. These heterodimeric molecules fulfill certain anticipated characteristics for the T cell antigen receptor, i. e., the presence of idiotypy (1 - 6), homology of the gene sequences to immunoglobulin (7 - 10), {{and the capacity to}} block the function of antigen-specific T cell lines or hybridomas when complexed with mAb that detect <b>private</b> <b>idiotypes</b> on the molecule (2, 3, 6). An additional functional characteristic expected of the T cell receptor is the ability to specifically mediate stimulation of resting T cells after interaction with antigen. This issue has been approached previously by using mAb that bind to the variable region of the antigen receptor on activated cells, such as interleukin 2 (IL- 2) dependent T cell lines, T-T hybridomas, or human T cell leukemias that expres...|$|R
40|$|The role of splenic lymphoid {{dendritic}} cells (DC) and macrophages (M phi) from mice in induction of immune {{responses in}} vivo has been investigated. Varying numbers of purified DC and M phi pulsed in vitro with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) or with rabbit antiidiotypic antibodies (Ab 2) directed against a <b>private</b> rabbit anti-TMV <b>idiotype</b> were injected back into syngeneic mice. In both systems, DC appeared to strongly enhance {{the primary and}} secondary responses to the virus. Optimal responses were obtained with 5 X 10 (4) purified DC carrying TMV or rabbit Ab 2. In contrast, M phi were less efficient {{by a factor of}} at least 100. These results show the potency of lymphoid DC as inducing cells in T-dependent antibody responses in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) {{antibodies}} {{were raised}} in rabbits against five monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for different antigenic sites on the hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza virus Mem 71 H-BelN (H 3 N 1) [A/Memphis/ 1 / 71 (H 3 N 2) x A/Bel/ 42 (H 1 N 1) ]. Each of the anti-Id sera was directed predominantly towards a unique (<b>private)</b> <b>idiotype</b> of the immunizing MAb, none of the five idiotypes being detectable in pooled BALB/c antisera against Mem 71 H-BelN virus or on most other anti-HA MAbs tested. Partial idiotypic sharing was observed, however, between certain MAbs, from different mice, having the same or similar epitope specificity for HA. When used as immunogens in BALB/c mice, {{two of the five}} anti-Id preparations induced antibodies that reacted with Mem 71 H-BelN virus and displayed neutralizing activity. Mice of other inbred strains responded similarly, indicating that the response was not genetically restricted by the Igh locus. From their pattern of reactivity with mutants of Mem 71 H-BelN virus with known single amino acid substitutions in the HA molecule, the antiviral antibodies elicited by anti-Id antibodies were shown to be directed to the same antigenic site on A/Memphis/ 1 / 71 HA as the original immunizing MAb (site A or site E, respectively). However, several of these antisera were shown to contain additional distinct subpopulations of antibodies specific for heterologous influenza A virus strains, either of the H 3 subtype or of a different HA subtype (H 1 or H 2). Since the induction of antibodies to HA of different subtypes is not a feature of the antibody response to influenza virus itself, their induction by anti-Id antibodies merits further investigation...|$|E
40|$|We {{have asked}} the question: how do partner cells in immunoregulatory {{interactions}} between T cell subsets acquire the ability to recognize and react appropriately with one another? In particular, we have asked whether these communication events are completely determined by the cell's genetic constitution, or whether the recognition events can be learned during ontogeny. We {{have found that the}} T cells of parent into F 1 chimeras and homozygous nude mice with F 1 thymus grafts not only learn to react with genetically disparate acceptor cells, but that the receptors on the acceptor cells themselves learn to react with genetically disparate producer cells. This learning process can overcome both major histocompatibility complex- and immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region-linked restricted communication between T cell subsets. We interpret these findings to indicate that thymic elements can start a cascade of differential events. The thymic elements, whether endogenous or passively acquired, select from a pool of producer cells those that will react appropriately with the thymic selecting cells, and these cells become expanded. Then, the <b>private</b> markers (<b>idiotype)</b> on the expanded pool of producer cells act as selecting and expanding elements that choose from a pool of acceptor cells those that recognize the producer cells idiotype as self. This second differentiational event, although apparently thymus evidence that this type of acceptor cell differentiation could also take place during the course of an immune response...|$|R
40|$|Since their {{original}} discovery (1, 2), idiotypes {{have been studied}} for two main purposes. As markers of immunoglobulin variable regions, recurrent idiotypes {{have been used to}} unravel the genetics of antibody diversity. Furthermore, {{it is likely that the}} immune system uses its own idiotypic diversity for regulatory purposes: idiotypic-antiidiotypic interactions play a role in the logics of lymphocyte interactions (3). Idiotype network concepts have inspired many works and have allowed specific manipulations of the immune system (4, 5). For example, minute amounts of antiidiotypic specificities raised against recurrent idiotypes can profoundly modify subsequent immune responses (6). In the case of idiotypes as individual markers, it is possible to induce silent idiotypes by the idiotypic cascade. The first studies were done in rabbits (7, 8) and were extended to mice systems (9 - 12) with very similar results. All these experiments show that it is possible to reprogram the immune response towards a predetermined goal. To further investigate these problems and to study the evolution of idiotype networks, we addressed the following question: can we bypass the species barrier and induce the expression of <b>private</b> rabbit <b>idiotypes</b> in mice? Our results show that this approach is indeed feasible using antiidiotypic antibodies that do not display at all the properties of internal images, using either the idiotypic cascade or rabbit antiidiotypic antibodies coupled to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1 (13, 14).

Anti-Id antibodies against 103 McAb reacted with (T,G) -A [...] L specific antibodies and specifically inhibited their binding to iodinated antigen. Similarly, conventional antibodies against the major idiotypes of (T,G) -A [...] L-specific antibodies inhibited the binding of 103 McAb to antigen. It is therefore suggested that 103 McAb shares major idiotypes with (T,G) -A [...] L-specific polyclonal antibodies of C 3 H. SW origin. Anti-Ids against 114 McAb also inhibited the binding of (T,G) -A [...] L-specific antibodies to antigen, but the binding of 114 McAb could not be inhibited by conventional aIds. Therefore, idiotypes of 103 and 114 McAbs define idiotypic determinants expressed on two different subpopulations of (T,G) -A [...] L-specific antibodies: those that carry major idiotypes and those which express idiotypic determinants other than the major one (minor Ids).
