40|$|Abstract Patch {{residence}} time {{is at the}} core of models of decision making by foragers living in patchy environments. We studied patch {{residence time}} (PRT) of Ibalia leucospoides, a parasitoid of the woodwasp Sirex noctilio, as assigned to 4 treatments (recent feeding and/or oviposition experience) foraging in an array of host-infested pine logs. We tested the effects of distance from release point, host abundance, and the number of con-specifics at the time of arrival, on <b>patch</b> (pine <b>log)</b> residence time. PRT depended on a combination of patch quality (number of hosts in a log) and distance from the release point. Neither the presence of con-specifics on the patch, prior exposure to hosts, nor feeding prior to the experiment affected the time spent on a patch. We conclude that PRT in I. leucospoides meets Marginal Value Theorem predictions qualitatively, overruling the effects recent oviposition experience, access to food and contact with conspecifics. These findings are in line with the reported pro-ovigeny in I. leucospoides as well as the strong spatial aggregation of hosts in the field...|$|R
40|$|Bird assemblages were {{documented}} in different forest {{types in the}} Warra Long Term Ecological Research Site in Tasmania's southern forests. Sampling was undertaken in areas immediately after clearfelling and burning, in regrowth up to 26 years after this treatment, in selectively logged forest, in regrowth following wildfire, and in old-growth forest. It was found that areas subjected to clearfelling and burning supported assemblages which were distinct from areas with other histories, in that they comprised fewer species and individuals. This adverse impact of silvicultural practices on bird populations was apparent in all strata of the forest; canopy, mid-layer and ground. Immediately after clearfelling and burning, coupes were colonised by ground-feeding insectivores more typical of open country than of the surrounding wet sclerophyll forests, but these were quiddy displaced {{with the advent of}} young regrowth, which was gradually colonised by forest-inhabiting species. However, these assemblages were still depauperate as much as 26 years after clearfelling. Comparisons with previous studies suggest that this deleterious impact of forestry operations on birds may be ameliorated by the retention of <b>patches</b> in <b>logging</b> coupes. This is supported by the absence of significant impacts on birds in parts of the area which were selectively logged 25 years earlier...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} was conducted on four patches of thermophilous oak wood in Białowieża Primeval Forest: A – with a woodstand: oak + approx. 30 -year-old hornbeam + hornbeam brushwood; B – with a hornbeam stand formed by natural seed fall after logging (ca. 1920) oaks; C – after logging oaks and replanted (ca. 1965) with pine and oak; D – with a natural low-density oak stand. Species composition and seed bank density were estimated using the seedling emergence method. Seedling emergence was observed over two vegetation seasons. Research demonstrated that: 1) the species abundance of the seed banks depends on canopy cover (A, B approx. 50 species; C, D approx. 70 species); 2) the floristical similarity (Sørensen's index) of the seed bank and ground vegetation is higher in the undisturbed patch D (0. 50) than in disturbed patches (0. 30 - 0. 35); 3) species diversity in plots A, B, C, D (H'= 12. 5; 13. 4; 15. 5; 16. 9) and seed bank density per m 2 (432. 5; 958. 0; 1486. 5; 2268. 0) are negatively correlated with the degree of patch shading; 4) the average weight of diaspores in the seed banks of shady plots is lower (A, B approx. 0. 003 g) than that of sunny plots (C, D approx. 0. 08 g); 5) the share of long-lived diaspores increases in <b>patches</b> after <b>logging...</b>|$|R
30|$|Recently, {{a variety}} of new image {{denoising}} methods have also been proposed, but very few approaches can perform better than BM 3 D. Many of these methods are based on the non-local idea, i.e., using similar image blocks (or patches) to explore new image denoising methods. For example, Zhang et al. [5] proposed a two-stage principal component analysis (PCA) on local pixel grouping, with its local pixel grouping achieved by block matching. Although this method successfully combined the classical PCA with non-local idea and achieved better results than those traditional local methods, the denoising performance of this method is still lower than the BM 3 D method. Rajwade et al. [6] used the higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) for image denoising, by modifying the 3 D transform in BM 3 D to HOSVD. For the color images with strong noise, HOSVD method can slightly perform better than BM 3 D, however, this method is not better than BM 3 D for the gray images or lower noise level situations. Papyan et al. [7] proposed a multi-scale patch-based method by improving the expected <b>patch</b> <b>log</b> likelihood (EPLL) method [8], this method can achieve better subjective visual quality of the denoised images with less artifacts, it can also be applied to other image processing problems, such as deblurring and super-resolution. There are also many other patch-based image denoising methods [9 – 18] in the literature. Some of them are improved non-local methods, while others are improved BM 3 D methods. Except patch-based methods, dictionary-learning based methods [19 – 28] can also achieve good image denoising results. For example, Dong et al. [29] proposed a combined non-local and bilateral variance estimation method, it provided a conceptually simple interpretation from a bilateral variance estimation perspective to further proposed a spatially adaptive iterative singular-value thresholding (SAIST), this method can achieve better denoised results in higher noise level situations, but it is only partially superior to BM 3 D. Most recently, there have been some new denoising methods developed. For example, Lebrun et al. [30] proposed a blind denoising algorithm, which can automatically estimate image noise. Ghimpeteanu et al. [31] proposed a decomposition framework for image denoising, and can better preserve image geometry (i.e., directions of gradients and level lines), when used with some existing denoising methods, such as NL_means and BM 3 D. Romano et al. [32] proposed a boosting strategy, i.e., employing a “SOS” procedure, to improve image denoising performance of some existing image denoising methods. But this method can only improve very little on the BM 3 D method, Romano et al. [33] also proposed a patch similarity measurement problem and used it to three kinds of image processing application. J. Mairal et al. [34] proposed non-local sparse models (LSSC, for learned simultaneous sparse coding) for image restoration which can better preserve image details than BM 3 D method on image denoising. S. Gu et al. [35] proposed a weighted nuclear norm minimization (WNNM)-based image denoising method, which achieved nice results especially on some texture-rich images, for example, House, and Barbara, however, this method usually produce some artifacts {{in some parts of the}} denoised images, especially in higher level noise situations.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine moderating and {{mediating}} factors of the efficacy of World Wide Web-based tailored behavioral smoking cessation materials. The design was a two-group randomized controlled trial in England and the Republic of Ireland. Participants were 3971 subjects who purchased a particular brand of nicotine <b>patch</b> and <b>logged</b> on to use a free Web-based behavioral support program. The intervention was Web-based tailored behavioral smoking cessation materials or Web-based nontailored materials. The 10 -week continuous abstinence rate was assessed by Internet-based survey at 12 -week follow-up. Potential treatment moderators were examined using subgroups of established or possible predictors of smoking cessation. Treatment mediators examined included 6 -week follow-up measures of program relevance and amount of the Web-based materials read. Within all subgroups examined, subjects in the Web-based tailored intervention were more likely to report 10 -week continuous abstinence at 12 -week follow-up. Significant moderators, indicating a significant difference in program efficacy between subgroups, included presence of a tobacco related illness (larger treatment-control differences among subjects with a tobacco-related illness), presence of nonsmoking children in the household (larger treatment control differences among subjects with nonsmoking children in the household), and frequent alcohol consumption (larger treatment-control differences among subjects with higher alcohol consumption). Perceived program relevance at 6 -week follow-up was a mediator of cessation at 12 -week follow-up. Robust results of the tailored program may be explained by the tailoring strategies utilized in the treatment conditions. Moderating variables may be particularly useful to address in tailored messaging. The mediating factor of perceived message relevance may provide a partial mechanism of effective program tailoring...|$|R
30|$|In {{the study}} area, the {{occurrence}} of grass ignition is accidental and depends on man, but the area of fire spread is essentially determined by climatic parameters {{and the presence of}} inflammable material, i.e., dry grass. High March temperatures cause a rapid snowmelt and then a low sum of precipitation in April increases the inflammability of the abundant dry grasses on the former fields: the less the density of the tree layer, the higher the abundance of grass and the quantity of inflammable material. Similar results were obtained in studies on savanna–grassland communities in Africa and south-central Brazil: tree cover was found {{to be one of the}} main factors limiting fire there and the predominance of grassy fuel was the primary cause of the high inflammability of these communities (Archibald et al. 2009; Hoffmann et al. 2012; Baudena et al. 2015). A strong association of wildfire risk with an earlier spring snowmelt, and increasing spring and summer temperatures, was also shown for mid-elevation Northern Rockies forests (USA) (Westerling et al. 2006), where grassy inflammable material may be scarce, but the ignition process is similarly related to climatic parameters. Prichard et al. (2017) showed for several fire-prone ecosystems that fire odds are higher in places burnt before. For the Mediterranean region, Moreria et al. (2011) concluded that with increase of fire frequency, homogeneous landscapes covered by fire-prone vegetation are formed. Our results indirectly confirmed these findings: in our area, fire odds increased along the series A 12 -A 13 -A 14, and in that sequence also the area of burning and the frequency of fires increased; fire odds also increased with the extent of the <b>patch</b> size (<b>log</b> transformed) and the increase in the number of burnt patches in the surroundings.|$|R

Stand (alpha) diversity of the understory was not affected by harvesting, although annual species turnover (beta diversity) increased slightly after harvest. There was an increase in aspen foliar nitrogen (N) for 2 yr following harvest. Soil nutrient concentrations did not differ between patch cut and unharvested plots except total potassium (18 % lower in the LFH of the harvested treatments 3 yr after harvesting).

The taps began sometime near the beginning of August 2004 and were removed in March 2005 without discovering the identity of the perpetrators. The intruders installed a rootkit targeting Ericsson's AXE telephone exchange.

40|$|Outdoor {{activities}} may have serious consequences for wildlife {{species that are}} sensitive to human disturbance. The pressure of outdoor activities on natural landscapes has increased dramatically in recent decades. However, we generally lack information on the spatial and temporal patterns of outdoor activities – a fact {{that makes it difficult}} to quantify the impact on wildlife and thus to implement and justify measures to constrain outdoor activities. In the winter seasons 2008 / 2009 and 2009 / 2010, we equipped 303 recreationists in the Val Müstair Biosphere Reserve, eastern Swiss Alps, with GPS loggers to record their spatial and temporal pattern of landscape use. We then analysed how the resulting pattern of spatial use overlapped with the habitat of capercaillie Tetrao urogallus, an endangered woodland grouse species that is highly sensitive to disturbance. For our study we used the official capercaillie core winter habitats observed by the game wardens of the Canton Grisons. The recorded 319 trips of 188 backcountry skiers and snowboarders and 231 trips of 115 snowshoers combined show an inhomogeneous use of subareas in the region. With one exception, the trips are located in the main valley and the adjoining southern and northern slopes and peaks. The trips of snowshoers result in a dispersed use pattern across the main valley, while the trips of the backcountry skiers and snowboarders are concentrated more on official and popular routes. Rarely did recreationists trespass official wildlife sanctuaries or cross capercaillie habitat patches. However, one official, very popular backcountry skiing route crosses one of the largest capercaillie habitats. Here the recorded trips show wide-ranging spatial use with many connectors to the main route. As a consequence, this capercaillie habitat patch is dissected into smaller undisturbed <b>patches.</b> GPS <b>logging</b> in combination with camera trap data provides detailed information on the spatio-temporal land-use pattern of outdoor activities. Based on these data, we identified a conflict of interest in the Val Müstair Biosphere Reserve that has to be resolved by management in a joint participatory process with the main stakeholders. Our methods and results could be transferred to other Alpine regions and be used for any land cover types. In this way we hope to contribute to mitigating conflicts between human outdoor activities and wildlife populations...|$|R
40|$|Historical extirpations have {{resulted}} in depauperate large herbivore assemblages in many northern forests. In eastern North America, most forests are inhabited by a single wild ungulate species, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and relationships between deer densities and impacts on forest regeneration are correspondingly well documented. Recent recolonizations by moose (Alces americanus) in northeastern regions complicate established deer density thresholds and predictions of browsing impacts on forest dynamics because size and foraging {{differences between the two}} animals suggest a lack of functional redundancy. We asked to what extent low densities of deer + moose would structure forest communities differently from that of low densities of deer in recently <b>logged</b> <b>patch</b> cuts of Massachusetts, USA. In each site, a randomized block with three treatment levels of large herbivores-no-ungulates (full exclosure), deer (partial exclosure), and deer + moose (control) was established. After 6 - 7 years, deer + moose reduced stem densities and basal area by 2 - 3 -fold, Prunus pensylvanica and Quercus spp. recruitment by 3 - 6 fold, and species richness by 1. 7 species (19 %). In contrast, in the partial exclosures, deer had non-significant effects on stem density, basal area, and species composition, but significantly reduced species richness by 2. 5 species on average (28 %). Deer browsing in the partial exclosure was more selective than deer + moose browsing together, perhaps contributing to the decline in species richness in the former treatment and the lack of additional decline in the latter. Moose used the control plots at roughly the same frequency as deer (as determined by remote camera traps), suggesting that the much larger moose was the dominant browser species in terms of animal biomass in these cuts. A lack of functional redundancy with respect to foraging behavior between sympatric large herbivores may explain combined browsing effects that were both large and complex...|$|R
40|$|Rapporten presenterer resultater fra et samarbeidsprosjekt mellom NINA og NORSKOG. Vi har sammenliknet samme type død ved i de tre forvaltningskategoriene naturreservat, nøkkel-biotop og slutthogsthensyn (kantsoner og gjensatte grupper av livsløpstrær), og sett på artsan-tall og -sammensetning av både biller i nydød osp og sopp på granlæger. Undersøkelsen er foretatt i fire ulike landskaper i Sørøst-Norge, nær Oslo, i sør- til mellomboreal sone. Gran er dominerende treslag, og alle stokkene har vært valgt ut fra blåbær- eller småbregneskog. For insektsundersøkelsen, som ble utført i tre av landskapene, ble det felt ferske ospetrær, kappet i lengder på 1 meter. De ble plassert ut stående og parvis med 1, 5 meters mellomrom, ett par per prøveflate. Alle tre arealavsetningskategorier ble studert i tre landskap, med 24 stokkpar i hvert av dem, 72 stokkpar totalt. En vindusfelle ble festet til hver stokk. Med to stok-ker var det mulig å sammenlikne billemangfoldet som ble tiltrukket av stokkene med det som faktisk ble produsert i stokkene. For å få til dette ble en av stokkene tildekket med et nett an-nethvert år, etter at begge var åpne for kolonisering i år 1. Vindusfellen hang inne i nettet og fanget insekter som klekket fra stammen. Av vedlevende billearter som inngår i analysen her, ble det registrert 345 arter med til sammen 13208 individer, av 573 arter fanget totalt. Mange arter ble funnet i lave antall; 60 vedlevende arter (17 % av alle vedlevende arter) kun med ett individ. Den vanligste arten, kortvingen Hap-loglossa villosula, forekom med 775 individer (6 % av alle vedlevende individer). 154 av de vedlevende artene er tilknyttet osp i større eller mindre grad, mens 11 har osp som eneste eller foretrukne treslag. Til sammen 21 arter er truet eller nær truet. Både vanlige og rødlistede biller som er tilpasset å leve i nydød osp, syntes langt på vei å kun-ne utnytte slikt {{substrat}} uavhengig av om det var lokalisert i et naturreservat, en nøkkelbiotop eller i et slutthogsthensyn. Biller som er spesialisert til å leve i nydød osp, ble fanget i lik arts-rikdom i våre eksperimentstokker i alle tre kategoriene, mens de øvrige ospeassosierte billear-tene hadde høyest artsrikdom i tilknytning til stokker som stod i nøkkelbiotopene. Slutthogst-hensyn-stokkene tiltrakk seg det høyeste artsmangfold av vedlevende biller totalt, inkludert mange arter som ikke kan leve i våre eksperimentstokker. Dette indikerer at forekomst av til-strekkelige mengder egnet dødved-substrat er viktigere enn hvor i landskapet det forekommer, for denne gruppen av biller og i våre studielandskap. Vedboende sopp ble registrert på 390 granstokker, fem for hvert par av ospestokker. For to av landskapene ble alle de tre kategoriene undersøkt, mens for de to øvrige landskapene ble stu-dert bare naturreservat og nøkkelbiotop. Til sammen ble det registrert 205 arter av vedboende sopp, fordelt på 30 poresopper, 169 barksopper og 8 corticoide heterobasidiomyceter. Hele 69 arter ble bare funnet én gang, mens fem arter hadde over hundre stokkforekomster. Totalt ble det observert 23 rødlistearter. Disse utgjorde 161 (5, 9 %) av totalt 2745 stokkforekomster. I tillegg ble det undersøkt et antall granlæger i granplantasjer med ungskog, samt foretatt noen mer kvalitative studier i mer påvirket gammelskog.

We have compared the same type of dead wood in the three conservation categories of nature reserve, woodland key habitat and retention patch (riparian margin zones and retention trees) and studied species number and species composition of both beetles in newly dead aspen logs and fungi on spruce logs. The study has taken place in four different landscapes in South East Norway, close to Oslo in the south and middle boreal zones. Spruce is the dominating tree species, and all of the logs have been selected from bilberry or small fern forest. For the study of early-successional beetles associated with aspen, fresh aspen trees were cut into units of one meter in length. The wood units were transported out to the study sites and placed upright, spaced about one meter apart, one pair for each study plot. All the three categories of area-based conservation measures were studied in three landscapes, each of them with 24 pairs of logs, 72 all together. A flight interception trap was mounted on each wood unit. Using two logs for each plot it was possible to compare the diversity of beetles that were attracted by the logs with what was in fact produced in the logs. To manage this, one of the logs was covered by a net every second year after that both of them were open for colonization in the first year. The flight interception trap was hanging inside the net and caught insects which hatched from the log. Of wood living beetles included in this analysis, 345 species were recorded with a total of 13208 individuals, of 573 species sampled totally. Many species were sampled in low numbers; 60 wood-inhabiting species (17 % of all the wood-inhabiting species totally) were recorded with only one individual. The commonest species, the rove beetle Haploglossa villosula, occurred with 775 individuals (6 % of all wood-inhabiting individuals). 154 of the wood-inhabiting species are associated with aspen to some degree, whereas 11 have aspen as the only or preferred tree species. Altogether, 21 species are threatened or near threathened. Both common and red-listed beetles which are adapted to live in newly dead aspen seemed to a large degree {{to be able to use}} such a substrate independently of whether it was localized in a nature reserve, a woodland key habitat or in a retention patch. Beetles specialized to live in newly dead aspen were sampled in about the same number in our experimental logs in all of the three categories, whereas the other aspen-associated beetle species had their highest species number for logs standing in the woodland key habitats. The retention <b>patch</b> <b>logs</b> attracted the highest diversity of wood-inhabiting beetles totally, including many species which cannot live in our experimental logs. This indicates that the occurrence of sufficient amounts of suitable substrate of dead wood is more important than where in the landscape it occurs for this group of beetles in our studied landscapes. Wood-inhabiting fungi were recorded on 390 spruce logs, five for each pair of aspen logs. For two of the landscapes all of the three categories were studied, whereas for the two other landscapes only nature reserve and woodland key habitat were studied. Altogether, 205 species of wood-inhabiting fungi were recorded; 30 polypores, 169 corticiaceous fungi and 8 corticioid heterobasidiomycetes. As many as 69 species were only found once, wheras five species were found on more than 100 logs. Totally, 23 red-listed species were found. They constituted 162 (5. 9 %) of a total of 2745 log occurrences. A number of spruce logs were studied from spruce plantations in young forests and some qualitative studies were performed in old forests more influenced by forestry. Very few of these logs had occurrences of red-listed species. In contrast to beetles wood-inhabiting fungi on spruce logs exhibited a distinct contrast in total species number and number of red-listed species between nature reserves and woodland key habitats on the one side and retention patches on the other side. The latter category is most often in the form of margin zones along mires. However, also for fungi, there is some variation: In cases when the margin zones were broad and consisted of forest with the character of nature forest, also this type seemed to function as a habitat for numerous species, included some red listed species. We also found a modest difference between the different conservation categories. However, both beetles and fungi showed greater difference between the different landscapes. The utility effect of setting aside an area, either as nature reserve, woodland key habitat, or retention patch, is high and complimentary for all of the three categories, evaluated from the criteria we have measured in the project. Given that the economic cost of setting aside trees is the same for all categories, the economic loss also becomes the same. But this prerequisite is not always true, and in reality, separate trees which are set aside, probably cost more per m 3 than the same amount of trees in forest reserves. Anyway, small scale considerations may to a larger degree become localized where they have the least cost, so that this effect can be reduced. The results also indicate that there is some degree of freedom of choice as to how area should be set aside, even though the ecological results also stress the significance of larger areas rich in dead wood in closed forest for wood-inhabiting fungi. The study further stresses that the woodland key biotopes have an important function to conserve red-list species. This does not only refer to signal species which in many cases have been recorded beforehand, but also to other red-listed species which cannot or only with difficulty can be identified macroscopically, but which were recorded in this study. Possible dispersal limitations of fungi and possible roles of woodland key habitats and retention patches in a dispersal network are discussed. Our results also show the significance of the width of the margin zone. Therefore, it will be favourable both with respect to biology and economy that the margin zones have sufficient width, so that they can house sufficient amounts of the right elements of dead wood in a short and long term perspective, and that they despite of small size may retain some kind of old forest environment on a small scale. From the results and current knowledge about the biology of wood-inhabiting fungi and beetles, it is reason to believe that the three categories of nature reserves, woodland key habitats and margin zone complement each other in a positive way, especially with respect to the need both for large and robust conservation areas and the occurrence of a network, which ensure the possibility for rapid dispersal and establishment. There is therefore every reason to continue current policies with an emphasis on all three categories of conservation measures. © Norsk institutt for naturforskning.

40|$|Patchiness of {{resources}} strongly affects productivity {{and diversity of}} arid systems. Patchiness associated with trees, shrubs, grasses, and animal diggings are well documented but {{there is very little}} information on the effect of fallen logs. Fallen logs are one of few documented non-living structures in arid lands that contribute to resource heterogeneity. They can be particularly important in grazed systems, where most resource patches associated with living plants are reduced or destroyed. Further, logs provide a unique opportunity to study aspects of resource patchiness without them having biotic effects on annual plants. My Ph. D. thesis consists of four chapters: Long term influence of fallen <b>logs</b> on <b>patch</b> formation and their effects under contrasting grazing regimes Here I studied the long term dynamics of patch formation and the effect of fallen logs in heavily grazed areas. I studied soil nutrient content and soil seed banks associated with the presence of logs in the long ungrazed Koonamore Vegetation Reserve and in adjacent heavily grazed paddock in chenopod shrublands of South Australia. I studied patches associated with fallen logs of unknown age, and others known to have persisted for up to 78 years. Logs acted as traps for soil nutrients and seeds. Organic carbon and total nitrogen were higher in soils next to logs, and also higher inside the reserve than in the grazed paddock. Propagule number and species richness were higher next to logs than in open spaces and viable seeds were in much higher abundance next to logs in the grazed paddock than any other site. Increased time in situ of a log had some effect on soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and available potassium. Logs act as resource traps which may enhance the diversity of the system, and may be particularly important for maintaining patches {{of resources}} in areas of severe grazing damage. Microclimate or accumulation of resources: which is the main driver of annual plant communities in a patchy system? Here I decoupled microclimate and accumulation components of a patch to determine their relative importance for plant communities. I measured soil temperature and soil volumetric water content next to logs and in adjacent open spaces. I then conducted a soil core swapping experiment to separate these soil microclimate conditions from seed and resource accumulation to assess their importance in determining annual plant communities. Soils next to logs had lower maximum and higher minimum temperatures than open space soils. Also, <b>patches</b> next to <b>logs</b> had lower soil volumetric water content and dried faster after a rainfall event than open spaces. The soil core swapping experiment showed complex interactions on the annual plant community suggesting that each factor has its own impact on annual plant communities. Spatial and temporal heterogeneity of resources drive changes in community structure of arid annuals Here I studied the effects of spatial and temporal heterogeneity on density dependence and community structure of annual plant communities. To achieve this I used fallen logs and open spaces coupled with high and low watering regimes in both the field and the glasshouse conducted over two consecutive years, encompassing two growing seasons. I found some evidence of competition among annual plant communities, but community structure of annual plants were strongly influenced by spatial heterogeneity of resources as well as watering regime. My results varied greatly across the two growing seasons, suggesting that both temporal and spatial heterogeneity of resources in arid lands are important determinants of annual plant communities. Patch formation and patch dissipation associated with fallen <b>logs</b> To study <b>patch</b> formation I introduced logs and fake logs (large PVC pipes) to open spaces at multiple orientations at two levels of grazing degradation. I assessed soil properties and any changes to annual plant communities over the three following years. I found that three years was not sufficient for creating changes to soil nutrients or annual plant communities when introducing logs, but the destocking which occurred during my experiment had a strong effect on soil nutrient contents. To look at patch dissipation I selected logs in pairs and one of each fallen log was removed. At each of log, open space and removed log I deployed soil temperature and moisture probes. I also collected soil samples to determine soil nutrient contents and soil seed bank across a one year period I found the removal of the log had immediate changes to the microclimate associated with the log, but that one year was not long enough to remove accumulated nutrients or seeds in the seed bank.
