5|$|In {{the second}} half of the nineteenth century, local artists also {{supplemented}} the figure with items such as radishes, <b>pretzels,</b> laurel wreaths and foaming beer steins. The symbol diversely appears in numerous places such as on manhole covers, beer steins and the top of the tower of the town hall. While the symbol as a man through being a monk was previously clear, its gender has become ambiguous since being designated the Kindl. One interpretation is that it is simply genderless, however in the 1920s a female inclination became apparent, and portrayals in person are to this day by young women.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Pretzel</b> Amusement Ride Company was {{a famous}} {{manufacturer}} of <b>pretzel</b> dark rides. <b>Pretzel</b> built over 1400 <b>pretzel</b> rides and sold them to carnivals and parks. The <b>pretzel</b> ride was invented by Marvin Rempfer. Leon Cassidy was Marvin's partner in the <b>Pretzel</b> Amusement Ride Company. Both names are on the patent. Leon Cassidy patented the single-rail dark ride in 1928 along with Marvin Rempfer. The company originated in Tumbling Dam Park {{on the banks of}} Sunset Lake in Bridgeton, New Jersey. A rider said that [...] "It felt like I was turned and twisted like a Pretzel", so the name <b>Pretzel</b> was chosen. A large heavy <b>pretzel</b> design was originally affixed to the front of each car to prevent the car from flipping backwards. In 1929, a standard <b>Pretzel</b> ride had five cars, 350 feet of track, and was one and a half minutes per ride. A <b>pretzel</b> ride sold for $1,200.|$|R

5|$|Warhop {{was born}} in Hinton, West Virginia. He spent his early life working as a coal miner for the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad. Warhop played for local semi-professional teams {{sponsored}} by the railway company. He drew the attention of several minor league teams, and in 1906, Warhop signed with the Class-D Freeport <b>Pretzels</b> of the Wisconsin–Illinois League in 1906 to start his professional career. His debut campaign included a no-hitter on Independence Day against the La Crosse Pinks. From 1906 to 1908, Warhop had an 82–20 win–lost record and 330 strikeouts, with a career high 30 wins in 1907. After pitching to a 29–7 record for the Williamsport Millionaires in 1909, people throughout both the National and American League started to take notice of his ability. As many as a dozen teams were interested in Warhop, and he signed a $1,000 contract ($ in today's dollars) with the Detroit Tigers. However, they soon sold Warhop to the Highlanders without appearing in a single game with the Tigers.|$|E

Otherwise the <b>pretzel</b> is a knot. 3) The determinant is divisible by 2 iff the <b>pretzel</b> is a link. 1. Introduction: Wha...|$|R
