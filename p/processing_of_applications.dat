Cẩn accumulated great wealth through corrupt practices such as graft in awarding foreign aid contracts from the United States governments of Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy to Vietnamese businessmen. He required the businessmen to pay a fee to the National Revolutionary Movement – the official party of the regime – {{in return for the}} <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> for foreign aid contracts and import licenses.

2500|$|The East African {{passport}} {{was launched}} on [...] 1999. The East African passport {{has been introduced}} as a travel document to ease border crossing for EAC residents. It is valid for travel within the EAC countries only and will entitle the holder to a multi-entry stay of renewable six months' validity {{in any of the}} countries. The passport is issued in three of the five EAC member states (Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania). The passports are available at the headquarters of the respective Immigration Departments in Nairobi, Kampala and Dar es Salaam. Only East African nationals may apply to be issued with the passports. The passport costs US$10 or the equivalent in EAC currencies. <b>Processing</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> for the passports will normally take two to three weeks. Although the passport is only valid within the EAC, modalities of internationalising the East African passport were being discussed with the aim towards having a common travel document for EAC residents by 2006.|$|E

The new concepts of anchor events and event expressions are used to create the mappings of past periodic patterns in data processing into the future database workloads.

30|$|Silva-Filho et al. [14] {{proposed}} {{improvements to}} both TCaT and TECH approaches. They presented {{a method for}} two-level caches known as TECH-CYCLES. Unlike previous approaches, this heuristic considers two different objectives: minimize energy consumption and improve the time <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>application.</b> Basically, TECH-CYCLES heuristic is similar to TECH heuristic, but besides considering the impact of energy consumption {{to determine if a}} solution is better than other, it also considers the time <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> an <b>application.</b> In practical terms, the exploration of a parameter in TECH-CYCLES continues while values of energy consumption and cycles <b>of</b> an <b>application</b> are better than last explorated parameters. The results from this approach have shown an average reduction of about 41 % in energy consumption for instruction caches and an improvement of about 25 % in time processing when compared with the TCaT heuristic. However, the method applied for data caches did not achieve good results in terms <b>of</b> time <b>processing</b> and energy consumption.|$|R
