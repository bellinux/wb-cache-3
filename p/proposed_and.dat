5|$|As {{a primary}} route to southwestern England, the A303 is {{frequently}} congested on its single carriageway sections. As {{it passes through}} the Stonehenge World Heritage Site and the Blackdown Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, attempts to upgrade the road in those areas have been controversial. In particular, the Stonehenge tunnel, which would see the A303 rerouted underground, has been <b>proposed</b> <b>and</b> delayed several times. Nevertheless, the road remains a popular alternative to motorway driving, and was commemorated in a book and BBC Four television documentary by Tom Fort in the early 2010s.|$|E

5|$|Before leaving office, Mahathir had {{condemned}} Malays who {{relied on}} their privileges. Abdullah continued this, warning Malays {{to learn to}} live without crutches or end up in wheelchairs. His administration began the practice of meritocracy, which Mahathir had tentatively <b>proposed,</b> <b>and</b> university admissions quotas were eliminated. However, some charged that this did not eliminate discrimination in education. The pre-university stream was divided into two; one course prepared students for the Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia (STPM) standardised examination, lasting two years, while the other comprised various matriculation courses graded by individual lecturers, typically lasting a year.|$|E

5|$|France, Russia and the United Kingdom {{recognised}} {{the autonomy}} of Greece, which remained a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire.

The Battle of Navarino (October 1827), fought after a chance encounter, resulted in the destruction of the Turkish-Egyptian fleet.|$|E

5|$|In early pregnancy, {{levels of}} estrogen, progesterone, {{estradiol}} increase, leading to breast growth {{in preparation for}} lactation. It has been hypothesized that if this process is interrupted by an abortionbefore full maturity (differentiation) in the third trimesterthen more immature cells could be left than there were prior to the pregnancy. These immature cells could then be exposed to carcinogens and hormones over time, resulting in a greater potential risk of breast cancer. This mechanism was first <b>proposed</b> <b>and</b> explored in rat studies conducted in the 1980s.|$|E

Early in 1991, he unveiled a plan to reduce military strength by the mid-1990s to 1.6 million, compared with 2.2 million when he entered office. Cheney's 1993 defense budget was reduced from 1992, omitting programs that Congress had directed the Department of Defense to buy weapons that it did not want, and omitting unrequested reserve forces.|$|E

In a 1969 work on horse coat colors, A los colores del caballo, Miguel Odriozola suggested that {{various forms of}} dominantly inherited white spotting might be arranged sequentially along one chromosome, thus allowing for the varied expression of dominant white. He also proposed that other, distant genes might also influence the amount of white present.|$|E

5|$|Several {{schemes to}} cross the Thames at Putney Bridge to Guildford, Surbiton or Wimbledon had been <b>proposed</b> <b>and</b> {{received}} approval from Parliament, although the District {{had been unable to}} raise the necessary funding. In 1886 the L replaced these plans with the Wimbledon and Fulham Railway that started {{on the west side of}} Wimbledon and crossing Thames to meet the District's Putney Bridge station. The line had intermediate stations at Wimbledon Park, Southfields and East Putney and a junction connected the line to the L's Waterloo to Reading Line just north of East Putney station. The District had running rights and extended some Putney services to Wimbledon on 3 June 1889.|$|E

The Zamoyski faction supported Sigismund, the faction led by the Zborowski family wanted Maximilian; two separate elections took place and a civil war resulted. The Habsburg's army entered Poland and attacked Kraków, but was repulsed there and then, while retreating in Silesia, crushed by the forces organized by Jan Zamoyski at the Battle of Byczyna (1588), where Maximilian was taken prisoner.|$|E
