5|$|The local Red Cross {{offices in}} <b>Port</b> <b>Vila</b> and Luganville {{prepared}} general relief supplies before the storm's arrival, including tents, tool kits, and first aid units. By {{four days after}} the cyclone's passage, the main wharf in <b>Port</b> <b>Vila</b> was re-opened and the two sunken boats were removed. Additionally, the evacuees were allowed to return to their homes, and communications between the various islands were restored. The Red Cross distributed various relief supplies to the affected citizens, including candles, matches, water, and blankets. By about two weeks after the storm, about 30,000household relief packages were distributed. The Vanuatu government allocated VT25million (2004VUV, $236,000 2004USD) for the affected citizens. Overall, the cyclone severely affected the daily lives of the Vanuatu citizens. On Tanna island, the cyclone's passage produced a malaria outbreak.|$|E
5|$|The third {{significant}} cyclone in 14months {{to affect}} the region, Ivy produced heavy rainfall and high winds in Vanuatu. Due to advance warning, only two people were killed, and several people were injured. The high winds damaged about 11,000houses, leaving many people homeless. The cyclone passed {{very close to the}} Vanuatu capital city of <b>Port</b> <b>Vila,</b> forcing the evacuation of about 2,000people and shutting down the main port. Cyclone Ivy also affected the Solomon Islands and New Caledonia with rainfall, and later it produced high waves in New Zealand that killed two people. Because of its severe damage on Vanuatu, the name Ivy was retired following its usage.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, {{the rest}} of the 3rd Division had been {{progressively}} sent to New Caledonia where it underwent further combat training. The 34th Battalion, its duties on Tongatapu at an end, joined the division in March 1943. In July 1943, Barrowclough informed the New Zealand Government that it was ready for combat duties, so in early September 1943, it moved to Guadalcanal for a combat role as part of the Solomon Islands campaign. However along the way, the troops stopped briefly at <b>Port</b> <b>Vila</b> in the New Hebrides to carry practice amphibious operations with landing craft before continuing onto Guadalcanal. Arriving off their destination on 14 September, the battalion was landed the same day. Jungle training remained the focus of the battalion although they also took the opportunity to work with Valentine tanks.|$|E

5|$|After passing {{slowly through}} Vanuatu, Ivy began {{accelerating}} {{to the southeast}} and its eye passed {{very close to the}} capital city of <b>Port</b> <b>Vila,</b> after moving over the island of Epi. As the cyclone moved away from the island group, it underwent an eyewall replacement cycle. In addition, the combination of cooler water temperatures, greater wind shear, less outflow, and land interaction with Vanuatu caused gradual weakening. Late on February 27, Ivy entered the area of warning responsibility of the Wellington Regional Specialized Meteorological Center. The convection rapidly diminished and left the circulation exposed, and Ivy transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on February 28. It remained strong and maintained a well-defined circulation as it passed just east of East Cape, New Zealand. Continuing southeastward, the extratropical remnants crossed the International Dateline on February 29, and Ivy dissipated about 1800km (1100mi) southeast of New Zealand on March 2.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of February 2004, a monsoon trough formed in the {{southwest}} Pacific Ocean during {{the middle of}} a Madden–Julian oscillation pulse. A low pressure area developed along the trough, and the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) designated it Tropical Disturbance 5F on February 21 about halfway between Vanuatu and Fiji. Initially, the system was moving little and had a circulation that was detached from the primary area of convection. On February 22 after the thunderstorms increased, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories on the disturbance with the designation Tropical Cyclone 13P. Shortly thereafter, the FMS reported that the disturbance developed into a tropical depression, although the convection was transient and displaced from the circulation. The system tracked west-northwestward, due to a ridge located to its south. With low wind shear and good outflow, the system gradually organized, with the circulation becoming situated underneath the convection. At 0300UTC on February 23, the FMS upgraded it to a tropical cyclone and gave it the name Ivy while the storm was about 510km (315mi) northeast of <b>Port</b> <b>Vila,</b> Vanuatu.|$|E
5|$|A {{resident}} of Malakula was struck {{and killed by}} a falling coconut while seeking shelter from the worsening conditions. Agriculture on nearby Ahamb Island, already impaired by Paula, was further compromised; all crops, both those remaining after Paula and those planted in the intervening time, were destroyed. Four classrooms on the small island were also damaged beyond use. Buildings on Aoba incurred appreciable damage, while on Efate, the storm brought down utility poles, severely damaged local schools, and left roads covered with debris and floodwaters. Flooding in the nation's capital city of <b>Port</b> <b>Vila</b> forced 50 residents {{to leave their homes}} in search of higher ground. Espiritu Santo, particularly the island's south shore around Luganville, bore the brunt of Cyclone Sose. Several types of crops (also weakened by Paula) took a heavy beating, and 60 people had to evacuate due to encroaching floods. In total, the storm demolished 59 houses on the island and in some way damaged another 101. A young child drowned after being swept away while attempting to cross a swollen waterway. Just offshore, the M/V Omale succumbed to the heavy seas; all 16 of its occupants successfully swam four hours to shore.|$|E

Owing to anomalies created by the Portuguese Corte's stay in Angra, the municipal council of Angra requested that Aires Pinto create a tribunal to investigate.|$|R
25|$|Between {{the end of}} the 15th and {{beginning}} of the 16th century, the settlement of Vila Franca do Campo became a strong provincial capital of the island of São Miguel. Elevated to the status of municipality in 1472, the town was the centre of the principal civil and religious institutions of the island, residence of the Donatary-Captain and, by consequence, the seat of the islands' most powerfal family (the Gonçalves da Câmara clan), that would later receive the title of Counts of Vila Franca. The presence of the main customshouse and relative shelter of the villages' islet, made the <b>port</b> of <b>Vila</b> Franca the primary entryway to the island.|$|R
5|$|A westward-moving {{tropical}} disturbance persisted northeast of Vanuatu, with persistent convection extending toward the Solomon Islands. On June 4, both the JTWC and RSMC Nadi classified {{the system as}} a tropical depression. With a ridge to the south, it moved to the west-southwest, quickly intensifying into Tropical Storm Gina by June 5 about 970km (600mi) east-southeast of Honiara. By 0000UTC on June 7, the JTWC upgraded Gina to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, after an eye became evident on satellite images. Interaction with the nearby remnants of Tropical Cyclone Epi caused convection to decrease. On June 7, FMS reported that Gina attained peak intensity as a low-end Category3 tropical cyclone on the Australian intensity scale, with winds of 140km/h (90mph). The JTWC recorded winds of 170km/h (105mph). A compact cyclone with a well-defined eye, Gina encountered stronger wind shear and cooler waters. After turning southeast and then east-southeast in response to a rapidly approaching trough, Gina quickly deteriorated as the convection became displaced from the centre. By June 9, the centre became uncertain as Gina stalled to the west-northwest of <b>Port</b> <b>Vila.</b> Winds diminished below gale force the next day.|$|E
5|$|On January 30, the poorly {{organised}} Tropical Disturbance 08F developed {{within a}} convergence zone about 325km (200mi) {{to the northeast}} of Apia on the Samoan island of Upolu. Over {{the next few days}} the system remained weak and poorly organized, and was classified as a tropical depression during February 5. The depression then moved westwards, before dissipating on February 9. Tropical Disturbance 10F developed on February 15, about 170km (105mi) {{to the north of the}} Fijian Dependency of Rotuma Island. The system was poorly defined and disorganised, while convection surrounding the system was mostly confined to the southern and eastern flanks of the low level circulation. Over the next few days the disturbance remained weak and was last noted during February 21, while nestled within the Solomon Islands. On March 6, Tropical Depression 11F developed under an upper trough of low pressure about 220km (140mi) to the northeast of Nadi, Fiji. Convection surrounding the depression was displaced to the north of the low level circulation center. The depression remained weak over the next couple of days, and was last noted during March 8. A fairly disorganized tropical disturbance developed during April 6, within a monsoonal convergence zone, about 236km (145mi) to the northeast of <b>Port</b> <b>Vila,</b> Vanuatu. It was initially located within an area of weak vertical windshear, but was expected to move into an area of stronger vertical windshear over the following 24hours and gradually become extratropical. During the next day, as the disturbance moved southwards, it was assigned the designation 14F, before it was dropped by RSMC Nadi during April 8, as convection surrounding the system became sheared and displaced. On April 13, Tropical Disturbance 15F developed within a monsoon trough, about 355km (220mi) to the southeast of Apia, Samoa. The system moved towards the south, with convection surrounding it poorly organised, and displaced to the north of the depression's low level circulation centre. The depression was then last noted, during the next day as Tropical Depression 16F developed into Tropical Cyclone Fili.|$|E

5000|$|Similar {{to other}} {{islands of the}} archipelago, Santa Maria {{was a victim of}} {{repeated}} attacks by privateers and pirates. In one of the principal engagements, a Castilian carrack with 40 men disembarked in the <b>port</b> of <b>Vila</b> do Porto (in 1480), where they were confronted by residents under the command of the Captain-Major João Soares (nephew of Gonçalo Velho and heir to the Captaincy of Santa Maria and São Miguel), who took to hurl rocks from the cliffs above Calhau da Roupa at the invaders. João Soares was eventually captured by the Spaniards, who took him in irons as a prisoner to Castile. After successive pirate attacks, the population was very hostile to travellers: in February 1493, the travelling Christopher Columbus was greeted harshly by its residents, when he and his crew were forced by a storm to land on the island in the Baía dos Anjos on their return from their famous [...] "discovery" [...] of the New World. Several of his crew were captured, and complex negotiations were undertaken to liberate the same. Thankful for their liberation, a mass was celebrated by him and his party in the old chapel before he returned to Spain. Although relatively far from the routes used by ships traveling to India, the island was repeatedly attacked by French pirates (1553), the island assaulted by French troops (1576), the English (Azores Voyage of 1589 and Moors (1616 and 1675).

25|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Winston was {{the most}} intense {{tropical}} cyclone in the Southern Hemisphere on record, {{as well as the}} strongest to make landfall in the Southern Hemisphere. Winston is also the costliest tropical cyclone on record in the South Pacific basin. The system was first noted as a tropical disturbance on 7February2016, when it was located to the northwest of <b>Port</b> <b>Vila,</b> Vanuatu. Over the next few days, the system gradually developed as it moved southeast, acquiring gale-force winds by 11February. The following day, it underwent rapid intensification and attained ten-minute maximum sustained winds of 175km/h (110mph). Less favourable environmental conditions prompted weakening thereafter. After turning northeast on 14 February, Winston stalled to the north of Tonga on 17February. Due to a change in higher level steering, the storm drifted back to the west. In the process, Winston again rapidly intensified, reaching Category5 intensity on both the Australian tropical cyclone scale and the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale on 19February. The storm passed directly over Vanua Balavu, where a national record wind gust of 306km/h (190mph) was observed.|$|E
25|$|Ahead of {{the system}} {{impacting}} Vanuatu, the Vanuatu National Disaster Management Council issued various tropical cyclone alerts to warn residents about the approaching cyclone, which included a red alert for the Maewo, Pentecost and Ambae islands. Because of the upcoming cyclone the national radio station extended its programming to run throughout the night of January 5–6. Vanautu's domestic airline Vanair closed its airfields in the northern islands and cancelled all of its flights except for several direct flights between Santo Island and <b>Port</b> <b>Vila</b> {{the capital city of}} Vanuatu. All ships and small boats were advised to seek refuge due to the high seas and swells that were expected from Susan. However, during January 7, Susan moved south-eastwards and the Fijian islands and spared Vanuatu a direct hit. Despite being spared a direct hit, heavy rain and gale force winds caused minor damage to several Vanuatuan Islands, including on Ambrym Island, where a woman died after being hit by a falling coconut tree, while gathering supplies to secure her house with. After the alerts were cancelled on January 7, by the National Disaster Management Council, most shops and government buildings on Efate island kept their shutters up because Cyclone Katrina was predicted to directly affect the archipelago within a few days.|$|E

The high winds affected 80% of the nation's food crops, including the loss of much of the mango and banana crops as well as the ruination of about 75% of the coconut and cocoa crops. The latter loss was significant due to its status as a cash crop. The cyclone damaged 90% of the water facilities across the archipelago. It also damaged about 60% of the health centers, as well as 112schools, some of which were completely destroyed. Monetary damage was estimated at VT427.6million (2004VUV, $3.8million 2004USD).
