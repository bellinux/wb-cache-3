2500|$|Later {{stories about}} Saint <b>Philip's</b> {{life can be}} found in the {{anonymous}} Acts of <b>Philip,</b> probably written by a contemporary of Eusebius.

[...] This appendix gives an account of <b>Philip's</b> martyrdom in the city of Hierapolis. [...] According to this account, through a miraculous healing and his preaching <b>Philip</b> converted the wife of the proconsul of the city. This enraged the proconsul, and he had <b>Philip,</b> Bartholomew, and Mariamne all tortured. <b>Philip</b> and Bartholomew were then crucified upside-down, and <b>Philip</b> preached from his cross.

5|$|Link: The Faces of Evil, Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon and Zelda's Adventure {{are three}} action-adventure games {{produced}} by <b>Philips</b> for the CD-i {{as part of}} Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda video game series. Not designed for Nintendo platforms, the games owe their existence to negotiations related to Nintendo's decision not to have <b>Philips</b> create a CD add-on to the Super NES. During these negotiations, <b>Philips</b> secured the rights to use Nintendo characters in CD-i third-party developer games. The Faces of Evil and The Wand of Gamelon were developed by Animation Magic and were both released in North America on October 10, 1993, and Zelda's Adventure was developed by Viridis and was released in North America on June 5, 1994.

Because the system had not been designed as a dedicated video game console, there were several technical limitations, such as laggy controls (especially for the standard infrared controller), and numerous problems in streaming-audio, memory, disc access, and graphics.|$|E
