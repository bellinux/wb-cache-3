5|$|It's good to {{know people}} didn't see it coming. That's a big concern when you {{have this kind of}} story line and you are leading to that kind of reveal. You don't want people to be expecting it, {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. I pride myself in the fact that, when you <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> issue of the comic, you don't know what's going to happen at any time. So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans swim {{well with}} their strong legs and their webbed feet. They rub {{the backs of}} their heads on their preen glands to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> oily secretion, which they {{transfer}} to their plumage to waterproof it. Holding their wings only loosely against their bodies, pelicans float with relatively little of their bodies below the water surface. They dissipate excess heat by gular flutter – rippling the skin of the throat and pouch with the bill open to promote evaporative cooling. They roost and loaf communally on beaches, sandbanks and in shallow water.|$|E
5|$|Defeated at Lae, the Japanese {{pulled back}} to Finschhafen, which the Americans and Australians chose {{as the site}} of their next offensive. On 21 September an assault force under Barbey left Buna, escorted by US destroyers {{including}} Mahan, and stopped at Lae to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> Australian infantry brigade. Additional US destroyers were attached to the force, preceding the convoy to the rendezvous point. On 22 September, before daylight, the amphibious force stormed the beach at Finschhafen; by noon, all troops were ashore. As the destroyers began to withdraw from the area, ten Japanese torpedo planes winged across the water, targeting Mahan and five other US destroyers. The ships returned fire, shooting down eight of the ten planes; the remaining two escaped. This scrimmage ended without any hits by enemy planes. By 2 October, Finschhafen was {{in the hands of the}} Allies.|$|E

5|$|In Adventure, the player's goal is {{to recover}} the Enchanted Chalice that an evil magician has stolen and hidden in the kingdom {{and return it to}} the Golden Castle. The kingdom {{includes}} two other castles (White and Black) and various obstacles and mazes within them. Further, the kingdom is guarded by three dragons: Yorgle (yellow dragon), Grundle (green dragon), and Rhindle (red dragon who moves much faster than the other two), that protect various items in the game and will try to chase and eat the player's avatar. There is also a bat that can roam across the kingdom freely, carrying a single item (which can include the player's avatar or a dragon) around; the bat was to be named Knubberrub but the name did not make it into the manual. The bat has two states, agitated and non-agitated; when in the agitated state, the bat will either pick up or swap what it currently carries with an object in the present room, eventually returning to the non-agitated state where it will not <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> object. The bat continues to fly around even if not present on the player's current screen and may continue moving or swapping around objects.|$|E
5|$|Not all early roguelikes were readily {{classified}} as Hack or Moria descendants. Larn (1986), developed by Noah Morgan, borrowed concepts from both Hack (in {{that there are}} persistent and fixed levels) and Moria (in {{the availability of a}} shop level and general difficulty increasing with dungeon level), but while these two games have spiraled in size to take multiple play sessions to complete, Larn was aimed to be completed in a single session. Larn also uses a fixed-time feature, in that the player had only so many turns to complete a goal, though there were ways to jump back in time as to extend play. Omega, developed by the Laurence Brothers in the late 1980s, is credited with introducing an overworld concept to the roguelike genre, prior to the feature's appearance in ADOM. Omega was often remembered for its odd inventory approach in which the player would have to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> object, considering it being held, and then moving that object to a bag or an equipment slot. Linley's Dungeon Crawl (1995) was created by Linley Henzell and featured a skill-based character progression system, in which experience points could be used to improve specific skills, such as weapon proficiency or trap detection. One fork of this would form the basis for Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (2006). SSI's Dungeon Hack (1993) offered randomized dungeons and permadeath within AD 2nd Edition rules.|$|E
25|$|The key {{seats were}} widely {{said to be}} Labor's third seats in Braddon and Franklin. Had Labor lost both of these seats, a {{minority}} government would have been likely. The Greens were hoping to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> extra seat from Labor in both Braddon and Denison.|$|E

25|$|With the {{introduction}} of microcomputers with expansion slots, like the S-100 bus machines and Apple II, it became possible for the modem to communicate instructions and data on separate lines. A number of modems of this sort were available by the late 1970s. This made the BBS possible for the first time, as it allowed software on the computer to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> incoming call, communicate with the user, and then hang up the call when the user logged off.|$|E
25|$|Perdita is {{an inner}} {{satellite}} of Uranus. Perdita's discovery was complicated. The first photographs of Perdita {{were taken by}} the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1986, {{but it was not}} recognized from the photographs for more than a decade. In 1999, the moon was noticed by Erich Karkoschka and reported. Because no further pictures could be taken to confirm its existence, it was officially demoted in 2001. However, in 2003, pictures taken by the Hubble Space Telescope managed to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> object where Perdita was supposed to be, finally confirming its existence.|$|E
25|$|From 15 February to 6 March 1945, {{was spent}} in the Leyte Gulf area, LST-22 departing for Manila, on 14 March, and {{returning}} to Leyte, on 26 March 1945. Two shuttle trips to Manila were made in April. LST-22 left Leyte, on 8 May 1945, with Convoy IG 21, for Hollandia, Dutch East Indies, where she arrive on 14 May 1945. From Hollandia, she went to Madang, New Guinea, to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> Australian Tank Company to be transported to Cape Torokina, Bougainville. From there she went to Green Island to load equipment for the Royal New Zealand Air and Ground Forces for Jacquinot Bay, New Britain, and reloaded there with Australian Ground Forces for Wide Bay, New Britain.|$|E

25|$|Collected Chirps will {{disperse}} if the their chain {{comes in}} contact with an enemy. Some of the chirps wear sunglasses; these chirps behave more unpredictably when dispersed. There are two enemy types in the standard rounds, house cats called Tigers and green iguanas called Iggys. These enemies can be simply avoided but can also be defeated with throwable items available on some levels. These items include telephones, flower pots, cups, and bottles. Flicky can <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> item by walking into it, and throw it by jumping. Sometimes diamonds may appear, which cannot be thrown but rather provide bonus points. There are also bonus rounds in which Flicky attempts to catch as many falling Chirps as possible in a net.|$|E
25|$|From Wide Bay, she {{proceeded}} to Manus Island, for availability for cleaning and painting her bottom. Arriving at Subic Bay on 10 July 1945, she unloaded {{for a limited}} availability after which she departed for Manila. Here she loaded cargo for Palawan, where she unloaded early in August, 1945, and from there {{proceeded to}} Zamboanga City, Mindanao. Here she loaded a full cargo and personnel for Leyte. The war was now over. After unloading at Leyte, she departed for Manican Island, for a 30-day availability beginning on 20 August 1945. On 23 September 1945, she was ordered to Leyte, and departed for Wakde Island, to load, as part of operations of lifting troops from rear areas. Loading at Wakde, with cargo and personnel for Zamboanga, she reloaded there for Agusan, Mindanao, and from there proceeded to Bacolod, Negros, Philippine Islands, to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> amphibious truck company and Philippine Army personnel. Proceeding to Dumaguette, Negros, the Philippine Army personnel were debarked and she proceeded to Mactan Island, unloading {{the rest of her}} cargo and personnel at Cebu City, Cebu. Loading at Mactan, she departed for Guiuan, Samar, and after unloading proceeded to San Pedro Bay, Leyte.|$|E
25|$|Crossing into Broome County, NY 17C {{abruptly}} {{climbs up}} the side of Bornt Hill and parallels the tracks and river into the town of Union, entering the urban core of the Binghamton metropolitan area. The route, still bearing the name of Campville Road, runs over the hill to the north and west of Tri-Cities Airport and the Triple Cities to the east become visible for the first time. After passing Glendale Technology Park, a former IBM complex, NY 17C crosses over to {{the south side of the}} railroad and passes the En-Joie Golf Course, one of the many remnants of the area's prosperity under Endicott-Johnson. As it takes on the name West Main Street and crosses South Grippen Avenue, NY 17C becomes a residential street, passing numerous single-family homes for a short distance as it crosses the border into Endicott. The route becomes a commercial village street before intersecting with NY 26, Nanticoke Avenue, at the center of downtown Union. Now concurrent, NY 17C and NY 26 <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> additional lane on each side as they proceed east as East Main Street through Endicott. The next major intersection is with Vestal Avenue, where NY 26 formerly left NY 17C, turning south and crossing the Susquehanna River to enter Vestal on Bridge Street, now CR 48. After Vestal Avenue, NY 17C and NY 26 pass under the Endicott Square Deal Arch.|$|E

25|$|Seeds of a split {{seemed to}} appear in mid-2006 {{around the same time}} as the {{redevelopment}} of the ECW brand. During a tag-team match on Velocity the Mexicools faced the reigning tag champions Paul London and Brian Kendrick. Although both teams respected each other during the match, Psicosis used the ropes to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> illegal pinfall to win the match. This led to Super Crazy questioning Psicosis' actions. Next, during a SmackDown! broadcast, Psicosis left Crazy to be attacked by The Great Khali after a match, saving his own skin and leaving his tag team partner to fend for himself. Psicosis would later abandon Crazy during a handicap match against Khali. On the June 23 edition of SmackDown!, Super Crazy and Psicosis got into a fist-fight after various miscommunications throughout the match, marking the split of the team. The two were still billed as members of the faction in the following weeks, even though they were interfering in each other's matches, until they had a match on an episode of SmackDown! which was won by Super Crazy. After the split, Super Crazy was moved to the Raw brand, while Psicosis stayed on SmackDown. On November 1, 2006, Psicosis' WWE contract was officially terminated by WWE because of his arrest in Mexico for stealing a car from 23-year-old Alexander Valencia Ramirez.|$|E
500|$|On {{the night}} of the 3 March 1943 the Luftwaffe was active again. Cunningham {{scrambled}} too late to get contact with the GCI's contact. He climbed toward a searchlight box. The searchlights operated in a box-shape, separated by evenly spaced markers. Each fighter was given a box and flew to its allotted marker beacon. There he orbited until the lights illuminated a target, or formed a cone where he could <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> AI contact. Soon he had a contact—a Dornier Do 217. He closed in but his cannons jammed. After sitting behind the Dornier for some time and trying in vain to encourage the guns to fire, the German crew suddenly woke up and dived away. Cunningham was furious. Three-quarters of the squadron got airborne but only he had seen an enemy. Unsatisfied with ground and aircrews, he used his influence in the small night-fighter community to bring in personnel from his old unit, 604, currently languishing in Cornwall. With the new VIII radar a uniform facility, Cunningham took command of a Mosquito NF.XII—the first Mosquito to have a smooth [...] "bluff" [...] nose dome over the dish antenna.|$|E
500|$|After its release, {{the book}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews. It was listed by Rolling Stone {{as one of}} the 10 Best Music Books in 2016. Jason Diamond from the publication reviewed it and found that the book gave a [...] "fuller, weirder and more interesting overview of Madonna" [...] than was already present in previous works about her. He complimented the author's [...] "riveting" [...] way of presenting the past figures from Bay City associated with the singer as well as Simone's own transition into indie music. Jennifer Levin from The Santa Fe New Mexican commended Simone's [...] "wit and grace" [...] in reporting Bay City's troubled relationship with Madonna, including the political agenda surrounding her. She noted that the story found its footing at the point in the book where the author wrote about Flying Wedge (in the last chapter). Writing for PopMatters, Megan Volpert rated the book 7 out of 10 stars, and described it as [...] "excellent", suggesting it as an important addition to modern cultural criticism. She commended Simone's writing and her courage to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> unusual subject for the book. Volpert commented, [...] "Does the world need one more half-baked biographical update on Madonna? No, it does not. What the world does need is Simone's productively clear-eyed assessment of her own musical and journalistic failures, [...] for the detours unavoidably provoked by fame and fandom," [...] concluded the review.|$|E
