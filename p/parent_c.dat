3000|$|Doping of {{alkali metal}} in the <b>parent</b> <b>C</b> 60 {{essentially}} expands the lattice and causes {{an increase in}} the lattice constant; the result is the enhanced density of states at the Fermi level N(ε F [...]). An intermediate consequence is a fairly large electron-phonon interaction (λ ≡ N(ε F [...])V)) depending upon whether inter- or intramolecular phonon is the mediating boson. The thermoelectric power S(T) is a powerful probe not only to understand the electronic structure, but also to shed light on the electron-phonon interaction. The mass enhancement effects can increase the thermoelectric power of a metal at low temperatures [9]. The mass enhancement is proportional to (1 + λ), and this correction is normally masked by large phonon-drag effect.|$|E

In order to select and develop N-efficient ramie cultivars in increased N application environments, the morphological, physiological and biochemical responses of a ramie hybridization line (Chuanzhu 11) and its conventional <b>parents</b> (<b>C</b> 9451 and R 79 - 20) to N fertilizer were investigated under rain-fed conditions during three consecutive growing seasons. Two contrasting nitrogen levels (low nitrogen, LN: 20 kg ha- 2; high nitrogen, HN: 120 kg ha- 2) were used. Results indicated that high N substantially promoted the growth of ramie plants and led to remarkable increase in fiber yield in all cultivars during the three growing seasons. Such increase was also recorded in net photosynthesis, transpiration rate and stomatal conductance, as well as chlorophylls and carotenoids. However, high N supply caused no alteration or increase in intercellular CO 2 (Ci) and Ci / Ca (ambient CO 2) ratio, depending on species. Moreover, high N application significantly improved soluble protein and proline content while it reduced malondialdehyde content. The activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase also elevated, whereas peroxidase activity decreased by high N application in all cultivars.

A significant enhancement of the Diels–Alder reactivity is found for systems having an endohedral cation, whereas a clear decrease in reactivity is observed when an anion is encapsulated in the C 60 cage.
