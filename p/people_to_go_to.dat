5|$|During the 18th century, {{the street}} {{began to be}} popular with the bourgeoisie living around Mayfair. Shop owners let out their upper storeys for {{residential}} purposes, attracting lodgers such as Jonathan Swift, George Selwyn, William Pitt the Elder and Laurence Sterne. In 1784, Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, an active socialite, demanded that people boycott Covent Garden as its residents had voted against Whig member of parliament Charles James Fox. This had caused him to lose his seat in parliament, leading to {{the dissolution of the}} Fox–North Coalition. She insisted people should look for nearer shopping streets, and encouraged <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Bond Street. Consequently, the street became a retail area for people living in Mayfair. By the end of the century, an upper-class social group known as the Bond Street Loungers had appeared, wearing expensive wigs and parading {{up and down the street}} in a pretentious manner.|$|E

In addition, some sports, like ice hockey and ice skating, are played on ice. Lakesides, beaches and water parks are popular places for <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> relax and enjoy recreation. Many find the sound and appearance of flowing water to be calming, and fountains and other water features are popular decorations. Some keep fish and other life in aquariums or ponds for show, fun, and companionship. Humans also use water for snow sports i.e. skiing, sledding, snowmobiling or snowboarding, which require the water to be frozen.|$|E

Specially marked bottles and cans of Coca-Cola Zero, when held {{in front of a}} webcam, enabled users to interact with the website's 3-D features using augmented reality (AR) technology. The film was heavily promoted in an episode of the Fox Network series Bones in the episode [...] "The Gamer In The Grease" [...] (Season 5, Episode 9). Avatar star Joel David Moore has a recurring role on the program, and is seen in the episode anxiously awaiting the release of the film. A week prior to the American release, Zoe Saldana promoted the film on Adult Swim when she was interviewed by an animated Space Ghost. McDonald's had a promotion mentioned in television commercials in Europe called [...] "Avatarize yourself", which encouraged <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the website set up by Oddcast, and use a photograph of themselves to change into a Na'vi.|$|E

The only verse in the Torah that mentions some of these species is Lev. 23:40, which, according to some Jews such as Karaites, indicates that Ezra's scribes interpreted that verse as referring to building materials for the sukkah, not waving the four species.

2500|$|Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva, a royal accountant, was a Portuguese New Christian.

[...] This exemption allowed <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Nuevo León who were legally barred from entering New Spain elsewhere. Carvajal was authorized to bring 100 soldiers and 60 laborers to New Spain; many have been documented as Crypto-Jews.|$|E

[...] The whole event lasted six hours, with the lead contingent finishing the march long before thousands of people could even move from the starting point. [...] The City government, under Republican Mayor Michael Bloomberg, had earlier denied the protesters a permit to hold a rally in Central Park following the march, citing concern for the park's grass.

2500|$|The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch (1965) {{utilizes}} {{an array}} of science fiction concepts and features several layers of reality and unreality. It {{is also one of}} Dick's first works to explore religious themes. The novel takes place in the 21st century, when, under UN authority, mankind has colonized the Solar System's every habitable planet and moon. Life is physically daunting and psychologically monotonous for most colonists, so the UN must draft <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the colonies. Most entertain themselves using [...] "Perky Pat" [...] dolls and accessories manufactured by Earth-based [...] "P.P. Layouts". The company also secretly creates [...] "Can-D", an illegal but widely available hallucinogenic drug allowing the user to [...] "translate" [...] into Perky Pat (if the drug user is a woman) or Pat's boyfriend, Walt (if the drug user is a man). This recreational use of Can-D allows colonists to experience a few minutes of an idealized life on Earth by participating in a collective hallucination.|$|E
2500|$|The adapted {{screenplay}} {{was written}} by Vaughn and screenwriter Jane Goldman. When asked how the book inspired his vision for the film, Vaughn said that he wanted [...] "to do Princess Bride with a Midnight Run overtone." [...] One of the difficulties with adapting the novel was its earnest and dark nature: an adult fairy tale in which sex and violence are presented unflinchingly. As a result of changes, the movie version has a greater element of whimsy and humour, with Gaiman's blessing given to the screenwriters. Gaiman did not want <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the theatre to see a film that attempted to be completely loyal to Stardust the book and failed. After creating the audiobook version of the novel, Gaiman realised that there were 10½hours of material in the book. This led him {{to acknowledge that the}} film would have to compress the novel, leaving out portions of the work. Budgetary concerns also factored into the adaptation, even with the level of 2006 technology.|$|E

60|$|What {{saved me}} was that I had a home and <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to.</b> I crossed the bay to Oakland, and, among other things, {{took a look at}} the death-road. Nelson was gone--shot to death while drunk and {{resisting}} the officers. His partner in that affair was lying in prison. Whisky Bob was gone. Old Cole, Old Smoudge, and Bob Smith were gone. Another Smith, he of the belted guns and the Annie, was drowned. French Frank, they said, was lurking up river, afraid to come down because of something he had done. Others were wearing the stripes in San Quentin or Folsom. Big Alec, the King of the Greeks, whom I had known well in the old Benicia days, and with whom I had drunk whole nights through, had killed two men and fled to foreign parts. Fitzsimmons, with whom I had sailed on the Fish Patrol, had been stabbed in the lung through the back and had died a lingering death complicated with tuberculosis. And so it went, a very lively and well-patronised road, and, from what I knew of all of them, John Barleycorn was responsible, with the sole exception of Smith of the Annie.|$|E
6000|$|Of {{course the}} {{intention}} of this book is not to induce <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Spain: railway journeys are long and tedious, the trains crawl, and the hotels are bad. Experienced globe-trotters {{have told me that}} all mountains are very much alike, and that pictures, when you have seen a great many, offer no vast difference. It is much better to read books of travel than to travel oneself; he really enjoys foreign lands who never goes abroad; and the man who stays at home, preserving his illusions, has certainly the best of it. How delightful is the anticipation as he looks over time-tables and books of photographs, forming delightful images of future pleasure! But the reality is full of disappointment, and the more famous the monument the bitterer the disillusion. Has any one seen St. Peter's without asking himself: Is that all? And the truest enjoyment arises from things that come unexpectedly, that one had never heard of. Then, living in a strange land, one loses all impression of its strangeness; it is only afterwards, in England, that one realises the charm and longs to return; and a hundred pictures rise to fill the mind with delight. Why can one not be strong enough to leave it at that and never tempt the fates again? ...|$|E
