5|$|After {{the first}} pit stops, the Mercedes drivers had {{to manage their}} tyres in order to cover from a {{possible}} attack by Ferrari, who had an extra set of fresh tyres saved from qualifying. Rosberg however complained over the radio about Hamilton {{in front of him}} driving too slow, which caused him to back into the charging Ferraris. He was unable to risk driving too close behind Hamilton, because dispersed air {{from the back of the}} car was accelerating tyre degradation. Hamilton was therefore asked by the team to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pace.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Pick</b> <b>Up</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pace</b> is {{the debut}} EP by Australian {{alternative}} rock band The Predators. It {{was released on}} 1 July 2006 through Dew Process and Universal Music Australia. The EP was produced after Powderfinger entered a hiatus, and several of its band members sought work with side projects. Following the release of <b>Pick</b> <b>Up</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pace,</b> The Predators embarked on a minor tour around Australia, including a performance at Splendour in the Grass, before officially going on hiatus, around the time Powderfinger reformed.|$|E

25|$|The Predators {{consist of}} the three {{original}} Powderfinger members; Ian Haug (guitar), John Collins (bass), and Steven Bishop (drums, vocals), and thus <b>Pick</b> <b>Up</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pace</b> {{was influenced by the}} band's early work. As the three had attended school together, the music on the EP flowed easily. According to Haug, the trio had been discussing the possibility of reuniting for a long time. Ross McLennan, the fourth Predators member, only played drums on live appearances, to allow Bishop to focus on singing. The EP was recorded at Haug's Airlock Studios in the band's home town, Brisbane, with songs first released to radio on 17 May 2006.|$|E
25|$|In December 2009, it was {{reported}} that company was struggling to repay its debts of 1.1 billion euros. The fiscal year ending in August resulted in an operating loss, and the company had to re-negotiate with its 15 funding banks debt repayment schedules for the years 2009–2011. The banks took a more controlling role in the company: it could no longer pay dividends, make investments, or sign new contracts without its creditors' approval. Tallink also had to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> in debt repayments if conditions were to improve, and had to look for options to sell or rent some of its ships. Most of its debts were incurred for purchasing Silja Line for 470 million and Superfast Ferries for 310 million euros.|$|E
25|$|After a {{relatively}} slow {{start to the}} 1999–2000 season, the Colts were able to quickly <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pace,</b> finishing {{with a record of}} 43–18–6–1 for a total of 93 points. Newly appointed team captain Sheldon Keefe led the entire OHL in scoring, winning the Eddie Powers Memorial Trophy and the Jim Mahon Memorial Trophy for his 48 goals and 73 assists on the season. Denis Shvidki, Mike Jefferson and Michael Henrich also finished in the top-twenty in scoring that year with 106, 87, and 86 points respectively. The Colts also received secondary scoring from the likes of rookie Blaine Down and centre Matt Dzieduszycki. In the playoffs the Colts faced the North Bay Centennials in the conference quarter finals, winning the series four games to two. In the next round they faced the Sudbury Wolves, winning that series four games to three. In their first trip to the eastern conference finals the Colts faced the Belleville Bulls whom they quickly defeated in 5 games, winning their first Bobby Orr Trophy. This meant that the Colts would face the Plymouth Whalers, a team who had won the Hamilton Spectator Trophy for finishing first in the league. The Colts defeated the Whalers in a seven-game series, winning the J. Ross Robertson Cup and advancing to the Memorial Cup finals in Halifax, Nova Scotia.|$|E

500|$|After the WaveAid concert, {{from early}} 2005, Powderfinger had {{a period of}} hiatus. During the separation, most band members pursued other musical projects; on the {{personal}} front, Haug and Middleton each had children, and Fanning met his future wife. Middleton's side project, Drag, had issued an EP, Gas Food Lodging, in 2002. Zombos Reviews found the EP was [...] "full of well-written jangly pop, and has some rather nice ballads". Their debut album, The Way Out, recorded in March 2005 and released on 10 July, was [...] "a tad disappointing ... mostly mid-tempo pop-rock songs, mixed with some slower, pretty ballads. Everything's tastefully arranged, and there's always nice melodies and harmonies". Collins and Haug formed The Predators with Powderfinger's former drummer, Steven Bishop, now on drums and lead vocals. The group released a six-track EP, <b>Pick</b> <b>Up</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pace,</b> in July 2006 and undertook a short tour around Australia.|$|E
2500|$|Riley led the Lakers to four championships. Dressed in sleek Italian suits {{with his}} hair slicked back with mousse, he added to the team's Hollywood image. Riley was also {{innovative}} on defense; {{he was one of}} the first coaches to employ a 1-3-1 half-court trap to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> of the game. Though the Showtime Lakers were known for their offense, they won championships with their defense. In Cooper, they had one of the top defensive stoppers in the game. The league-wide perception was that the Lakers played with finesse and were not physical enough to win in the playoffs. Riley's mantra was [...] "no rebounds, no rings", reinforcing the need to fight for rebounds in order to win championships.|$|E
2500|$|On July 10, Bearzotti {{stated that}} Jalisco {{authorities}} were [...] "disinterested" [...] and were moving {{slowly in the}} case. She stated that their investigators took several days {{to act on the}} leads the family gave to them, thus harming their possibilities to find Tobares since she believed that the first days of his disappearance were crucial for the investigation. Bearzotti told the press that Jalisco officials showed advancements in the case the way the family wanted to see a month later and after the Argentine and Mexican government pressured them to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> of the investigation. Tobares' sister Ana Soledad said she was shocked about the kidnappings and disappearances in Mexico, and thanked officials at the municipal, state, and federal level who were working on the case.|$|E
50|$|Tadese sprinted to {{lead the}} race at the start but he was soon {{overtaken}} by Nicholas Kemboi, who led until the 4000-metre mark. Tadese and Masai <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> and <b>the</b> Eritrean fronted the fastest group of runners from 5000 metres onwards. After a kilometre further on, a group of four runners (Tadese, Masai, Bekele and Kogo) were clearly leading the race as the other competitors trailed off. Tadese continued to lead and <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> once again, at which point Kogo dropped off, shortly followed by Masai. Bekele continued to follow Tadese waiting, and on the last lap the reigning champion finally took the lead, sprinting away to win {{the gold medal in}} a Championship record time of 26:46.31. Tadese yet again took the silver, with a run of 26:50.12, and Masai maintained his third position for the bronze.|$|R
50|$|With an open track {{ahead of}} him now, Tom Sneva <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> and put {{considerable}} distance {{between himself and the}} Unsers.

[...] Joining the River was great and with a good flow they picked up time {{all the way down}} completing the 54 miles in 6hrs (averaging 9mph) arriving at Teddington at 1920hrs for the Tideway, well up on schedule. The crew were able to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pace</b> spurred on by familiar sights and the welcome relief of the lights on the London Eye wheel. [...] Baker/Capps raced under Westminster Bridge and could see from the illuminated face of Big Ben that they had managed to complete the 17mile Tideway section in just under 1hr 48mins.|$|E

50|$|Harrisburg {{finished}} {{in the middle of}} the pack in its first season, winning 26 and losing 28 for a fifth-place spot (out of eight teams).

50|$|McLennan drums for The Predators {{only during}} live performances, as all {{recorded}} drumming is performed by Steven Bishop, {{who is also}} the group's singer. McLennan's style is influenced mainly by alternative and classical rock drummers, such as Dave Grohl, John Bonham, Charlie Watts, and Ringo Starr. The Predators' debut EP, <b>Pick</b> <b>Up</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pace,</b> has also drawn comparisons to the likes of David Bowie, especially when performed at live concerts such as Splendour in the Grass.|$|E
500|$|... 'I Miss You' and bonus track 'Schoolin' Life' both {{showcase}} {{opposite sides}} of that magnificent decade's musical spectrum. The former is a stripped down track carried mostly by a hollow beat and dismal synthesizers, allowing Knowles and her morosely beautiful voice center stage ... <b>The</b> latter <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>pace,</b> peppered liberally with old-school horns and crashes. Knowles details her experiences growing up, but parallels can be drawn to the maturation she's going through on this very album. More than any song, 'Schoolin' Life' literally oozes confidence, providing an endearing edge to an already catchy track.|$|R
