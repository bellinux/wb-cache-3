40|$|AbstractThe {{level of}} damage {{imparted}} on {{three types of}} satellites components resulting from hypervelocity impacts of aluminum projectiles onto a neighboring structural part have been assessed experimentally by using a double stage light gas gun. The experimental configurations were designed to simulate debris encounters with a space vehicle during its operational life time around the Earth. The first test was conducted against a set of separate harness strapped down on the inner surface of a carbon facesheet sandwich panel {{in order to assess}} the effectiveness of redundant cables spacing in case of unitary debris <b>perforating</b> <b>impact</b> onto the structure. The resistance to damaging of a silicon carbide mirror and a solar panel was then evaluated against debris cloud generated by prior impact of chunky debris with the satellite structure. Potential losses of electrical functional capabilities were then derived. The vulnerability/Survivability Pléiades software was updated accordingly...|$|E
40|$|Man-made orbital poses {{a serious}} threat to {{spacecraft}} that are launched to operate in Earth orbit because it can strike such spacecraft at very high velocities and consequently damage mission-critical systems. This paper describes the findings of a study whose objective was to develop a system of empirical equations {{that can be used to}} predict the trajectories and spread of the debris clouds that exit the rear facesheet following a high speed <b>perforating</b> <b>impact</b> of a honeycomb sandwich panel (HC/SP). These equations are based on a database containing the results of nearly 400 tests from 13 previously published papers and reports. Overall the correlation coefficient values for the various regression equations obtained are fairly reasonable, and range from near 60 % to well above 90 %. This indicates that the chosen forms of the equations are a good fit to the data, and that they are capable of picking up most of the variations in the data that result from changes in test conditions. These equations can now be used to estimate the amount of mass in a debris cloud if an HC/SP is perforated by a high speed impact, where this mass will travel, and what spacecraft components will be impacted by it. This information can then be fed into a risk assessment code to calculate the probability of spacecraft failure under a prescribed set of impact conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This present work {{investigated}} the <b>perforated</b> <b>impact</b> strength of woven kenaf fiber reinforced composites subjected to different projectile velocities. Three layers of woven kenaf mats were stacked with four different fiber orientations 0, 15, 30 and 450. The composites are fabricated using hand-layout where the woven mats were placed into the mould with a polymeric resin. The wetted composites were compressed {{to squeeze out}} the excessive resin and to eliminate the void contents. The hardened samples were shaped into a standard geometry specified by ASTM D 3763. Then, the composites were <b>perforated</b> <b>impact</b> using different speeds 1, 2 and 3 m/s. According to the present results, {{it was found that}} the <b>perforated</b> <b>impact</b> strength reduced when the impact velocity was increased. However, the impact strength of 150 oriented composite was higher when compared with other types of composites...|$|R
40|$|Normal and oblique {{incidence}} hypervelocity impact tests (velocity range 4 - 6 km s(- 1)) {{were carried out}} to determine the ballistic limit of a 1. 6 mm carbon fibre reinforced plastic facesheet bonded to 45 mm aluminium honeycomb core, as typically used in Low Earth Orbiting spacecraft. The internal honeycomb damage was determined {{as a function of}} the impactor parameters. The ballistic limit data showed a strong dependence with impact angle. The internal honeycomb damage was found to be independent of impact angle for constant impact energy for Theta< 50 degrees. An empirically-determined damage equation linking honeycomb damage to impact energy was developed. For the highest <b>impact</b> energy <b>perforating</b> <b>impacts,</b> the debris cone angles for the primary and secondary debris cones were determined. As the impact angle increased, the centre of the damage cones rotated away from the line of flight. The data have been compared with the ballistic limit curve defined by the modified Cour-Palais aluminium Whipple bumper equation and show broad agreement with the equation predictions. A reduced value of the rear facesheet thickness is required to bring the normal and 15 degrees incidence data into agreement with the ballistic limit curve...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a combined experimental-computational {{study of the}} impact of steel spheres on thin armor plates at an oblique angle of 70 deg. The plates were nominally 6 mm thick, rolled homogeneous armor. Two types of spheres were used, a hard steel and a soft iron. In all cases the velocity was around 1500 m/s. This combination of velocity and materials resulted in plate perforation for the hard spheres, whereas for the soft spheres the plates were not <b>perforated.</b> The <b>impact</b> process was radiographed at 5 µs intervals and the plates were cut to allow an examination of their cross-section. The simulations were carried out with two hydrocodes: the DYTRAN code, employing an Euler solver, and the AUTODYN code, using an eroding Lagrange solver. The results of the simulation agree quite well with the experimental material contours obtained from radiographs, and with the final crater shapes...|$|R
40|$|The key to {{conducting}} an accurate damage {{assessment of a}} target impacted by a high speed projectile {{is the use of}} a robust assessment methodology. To accurately determine total target damage, a damage assessment methodology must include the effects of discrete impacts by solid debris cloud fragments as well as impulsive loadings due to molten and vaporous debris cloud material. As a result, the amount of debris cloud material {{in each of the three}} states of matter must be known to accurately assess total target damage and break-up due to a high speed impact. This article presents a first-principles based method to calculate: the amount of material in a debris cloud created by a <b>perforating</b> hypervelocity <b>impact</b> that is solid, molten, and vaporous; the debris cloud leading edge, trailing edge, center-of-mass, and expansion velocities; and the angular spread of the debris cloud material. The predictions of this methodology are compared against those of empirically based lethality assessment schemes as well as numerical and empirical results obtained in previous studies of debris cloud formation...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of {{hypervelocity}} impact fluxes (in both {{thick and}} thin targets) detected by the University of Kent at Canterbury's Timeband Capture Cell Experiment (TiCCE) (flown on ESA's Eureca spacecraft) are presented. The foil perforations are used to derive the ballistic limit values, or the maximum thickness of Al <b>perforated,</b> for the <b>impacting</b> particles. This data is then combined with the thick target data to derive a unified ballistic limit flux. A significant enhancement in the observed large particle flux compared with LDEF is found, possibly due to the pointing history of Eureca compared to the Earth's orbital direction. Comparisons are also made to predictions from ESABASE modelling. Preliminary results of a study of perforation morphology are also presented, providing insight into particle shape, density and directionality...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate a multifunctional system under high- to hyper-velocity impact loading. This multifunctional system is a plate structure that, in addition to its load bearing function, has the ability of self-repairing holes generated by impacts. In order to achieve multiple functionality the panel consists of several different layers, each having a specific task, and thus primary contributing to a specific function of the entire multifunctional structure system. From a structural point of view this multifunctional system can be considered as a multilayer plate. From a functional perspective the panel layers can be divided in two groups: structural layer and self-healing layer. Each layer can occur once or more in a panel configuration. The performance of the multifunctional structure depends on the number of layers, the mechanical and physical properties of the individual layers, layer thickness and on the arrangement of the various layers in a multifunctional structure. The multifunctional system investigated in this work consists of one self-healing layer and one or two structural layers. To provide the structural system with the ability to seal holes generated by <b>perforating</b> <b>impacts</b> a layer of ethylene-co-methacrylic acid ionomer was used in a multifunctional system. These ionomers have been observed to self-heal following ballistic puncture and such a response is an inherent behaviour of those materials, therefore no external intervention is necessary in the self-healing process. For the structural layers, plates made of composite materials were used. Two slightly different structural layers were investigated. One is a laminate made entirely of carbon fibre reinforced plastics, while the other is a carbon fibre laminate with aramid fabric/epoxy resin composite layers attached to its front and back face. These two structural layers and the ionomer layer were combined to form several configurations of multifunctional panels. The different configurations, including also the individual layers alone, were tested under impact loading. Tests on the ionomer alone were performed to study its protection capability for bumper applications. For this purpose tests on aluminium plates were also performed and the results were compared to those of the ionomer. The protection capability was evaluated by studying the damage on witness plates and the momentum transferred to them. The composite structural layers for the multifunctional structure were tested individually and their behaviour was compared with that of the ionomer self-healing layer. Multifunctional panel configurations consisting of two and three layers were also tested. The impact behaviour and the comparison of the various configurations were characterized through the momentum transfer to the witness plate, the fragments velocities in the debris cloud, the damage in the layers, in certain cases the damage on the witness plate was also used. Several instruments were used to measure the relevant quantities. A ballistic pendulum was used to estimate the momentum of the debris cloud. A high-speed video camera was employed to film the impact tests, which enabled the measurement of fragments velocities by a dedicated software. An ultrasound flaw detector was applied for delamination damage detection in the composite material. Superficial damage was inspected visually. Learning how to use the ultrasound flaw detector and the high-speed video camera was an integral part of the PhD work that required a considerable amount of time. The self-healing of the ionomer was checked for all tests by visually examining the ionomer samples. The experiments were conducted at the CISAS impact facility, using a two stage light gas gun. The impact velocities in the experimental tests ranged from 1. 0 to 4. 0 km/s. Aluminium spherical projectiles were used, and ranged in diameter from 1. 5 to 5. 6 mm. Numerical simulations of the experimental tests on the individual layers were performed and the results were compared. The numerical simulations were performed with the commercially available ‘hydrocode’ Ansys Autodyn. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The work {{presented}} in this paper concerns a project on the optimization of protections subjected to explosions (IED’s threat). Explosions generate two types of threats for a protective structure: blast and <b>impact</b> of fragments. <b>Perforating</b> and non-perforating <b>impact</b> tests were performed in our laboratory with steel spherical projectiles impacting a target based on Kevlar® textile layers and a crushable material, Crushmat®. These tests required to develop a specific experimental test setup in order to contain the composite protective structure {{and to be able to}} measure the relevant parameters. The experiments allow us to determine the ballistic performance and basic parameters of the protection, and to validate finite element numerical models (LS-DYNA) resulting in a performant prediction tool. The approach used for the simulation consists in the representation of the full textile architecture with solid elements. Therefore, the textile material is explicitly re{{presented in}} the model in order to have a good representation of the physical phenomena occurring during impact. For the crushable material, a representation using SPH was chosen in order to take the granular behaviour of this material into account. Good results are obtained with such models. However, these models are very complicated and computing time consuming. The geometry has to be well adapted and symmetry has to be exploited. On the other hand, representation of a granular material with SPH does not take into account some characteristics of this material during impact, such as the pulverisation process of the granular material. Solutions to take these phenomena into account in the model are proposed...|$|R
