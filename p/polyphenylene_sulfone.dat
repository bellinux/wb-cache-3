30|$|Surprisingly, <b>poly(phenylene</b> <b>sulfone)</b> (PPSU) {{which is}} one {{the members of the}} {{polysulfone}} family, has superior physical and chemical properties compared to bisphenol-A-modified polysulfones. Only few researchers have studied the applicability of PPSU in fuel cell (Luisa Di Vona et al. 2006, 2008; Sgreccia et al. 2011; Hsiang Weng et al. 2008). However, not much attention was paid to PPSU for UF applications. Hence, the present investigation is aimed to study the utility of PPSU in ultrafiltration applications.|$|E
30|$|<b>Poly(phenylene</b> <b>sulfone)</b> {{membranes}} {{were successfully}} modified by adding MWCNT and carboxylated MWCNT {{for the formation}} of the blend membranes, where MWCNT and FMWCNT resulted in higher separation figures of merit including with water flux and water content and lower hydraulic resistance. The addition of MWCNT and FMWCNT also slightly altered the molecular weight cut-off (MWCO), membrane structure and the mechanical properties of the membranes. The improved surface hydrophilicity, due to surface enrichment of –COOH content, endowed the PPSU/FMWCNT blend membranes with significantly enhanced protein adsorption resistance. We observed that the incorporation of the hydrophilic MWCNT and FMWCNT blend membranes {{played a major role in}} improving the flux and performance characteristics of membranes.|$|E

The enrichment of CNT in the surface of the membrane ascertained through Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The surface and cross-sectional morphology were analyzed by SEM. Furthermore, model proteins such as trypsin (20  kDa), pepsin (35  kDa), egg albumin (45  kDa) and bovine serum albumin (69  kDa) rejection experiments were carried out under identical operational conditions employing both the PPSU and blend membranes. The protein rejection efficiency and stable permeate flux were tested to compare the separation behavior of both the ultrafiltration membranes.

40|$|Research Objective: Explore the {{utilization}} of the phenyl or methylphosphine oxide moiety on the fire resistance of ductile thermoplastic high performance materials. Approach: The approach has been to synthesize either aromatic diamine monomers containing the phenylphosphine oxide structure for polyimides, or the activated aromatic halide containing the phenyl or methyl phosphine oxide connecting link for poly(a ylene ether) s or poly(arylene sulfide) s. ACCOMPLISHMENT DESCRIPTION: Two Ph. D. theses have been completed and several preliminary publications have been developed. Additional manuscripts are in press and some have been accepted for publication. Significance: The aryl phosphine oxide structure is readily incorporated into engineering thermoplastic backbones in controlled concentrations. It is hydrolytically stable, but allows for the transformation into a very high char residue after burning. The formed char prevents ignition and detracts from the continued burning of a fire that has been initiated. Expected Results: The thermoplastic poly(ether imide) s and thermoplastic <b>poly(phenylene</b> sulfide <b>sulfone)</b> copolymers had similar, if not better properties, than the control commercially available materials. They have provided equal or better reduced heat release rates relative to their commercial counterparts and in traditional tests they self-extinguish more rapidly...|$|R

The membranes were also subjected to the determination of molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) using different molecular weights of proteins. During trypsin ultrafiltration, PPSU/MWCNT and PPSU/FMWCNT membranes showed a slower flux decline rate than did the PPSU membrane.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we have {{explored}} and compared {{the effectiveness of}} using (1) lab-fabricated forward osmosis (FO) membranes under both FO and reverse osmosis (RO) modes and (2) commercially available RO membranes under the RO mode {{for the removal of}} organic micro-pollutants. The lab-fabricated FO membranes are thin film composite (TFC) membranes consisting of a polyamide layer and a porous substrate cast from three different materials; namely, Matrimid, polyethersulfone (PESU) and sulfonated <b>polyphenylene</b> <b>sulfone</b> (sPPSU). The results show that the FO mode is superior to the RO mode in the removal of phenol, aniline and nitrobenzene from wastewater. The rejections of all three TFC membranes to all the three organic micro-pollutants under the FO processes are higher than 72 % and can be even higher than 90 % for aniline when a 1000 ppm aromatic aqueous solution and 1 M NaCl are employed as feeds. These performances outperform the results obtained from themselves and commercially available RO membranes under the RO mode. In addition, the rejection can be maintained even when treating a more concentrated feed solution (2000 ppm). The removal performance can be further enhanced by using a more concentrated draw solution (2 M). The water flux is almost doubled, and the rejection increment can reach up to 17 %. Moreover, it was observed that annealing as a post-treatment would help compact the membrane selective layer and further enhance the separating efficiency. The obtained organic micro-pollutant rejections and water fluxes under various feasible operating conditions indicate that the FO process has potential to be a viable treatment for wastewater containing organic micro-pollutants...|$|E

40|$|Two {{approaches}} {{were employed}} to prepare polymeric materials for studying second order nonlinear effects, particularly second harmonic generation (SHG) in polysulfones. The first approach is based on host and guest system. Nethyl-N-hydroxyethyl- 4 - (4 '-nitrophenylazo) phenylamine (Disperse Red 1 dye) was doped in four different polysulfone resins, viz., po 1 y(oxy- 1, 4 -phenylenesulfonyl- 1, 4 -phenyleneoxy- 1, 4 -phenyl- eneisopropylidene- 1, 4 -phenylene), <b>poly(phenylene</b> ether <b>sulfone),</b> poly(phenyl sulfone) and poly(3 -bicyclo[2. 2. 1]heptyl-sulfonyl). Their second harmonic generation (SHG) properties were characterized and compared. Those doped systems demonstrate high second order nonlinearity. The observed Xeff (2) is ranged from 11 to 21 pm/V. The merit of polysulfone resins as a host material are good optical clarity, easy film form-ing ability, and fairly high glass transition (Tg) temperatures (140 - 190 [degrees Celsious]. As compared to polyimide of resins they have good resistance to hydrolysis. They are good candidates for electrooptical materials and also good subsitution for PMMA in modelling studies. We demonstrate {{for the first time}} a new approach in preparing second order nonlinear optical films that are imageable. The advantage of this approach is no etching step is necessary in forming a complex pattern. A SH-active dye, Disperse Red 1, was attached to a photooxidized poly(oxy- 1, 4 -phenylenesulfonyl- 1, 4 - phenyleneoxy- 1, 4 -phenyleneisopropylidene- 1, 4 -phenylene) surface. Complex pattern can be achieved with sophisticated masks. Since the amount of dye attached on the polysulfone surface is small, a more sensitive measurement technique based on photon counting was employed for measuring the SHG effect. The SH intensity from the DR 1 attached surface is 1. 6 to 2. 8 times greater than the off-dye region...|$|R

Our results show that the majority of methanol molecules are bound with the backbone of sPEES, while almost all of the methanol molecules in Nafion are in the "free" state. In particular, both the -OH and -CH 3 of the bound methanol molecules interact with the polymer within sPEES. It demonstrates the existence of a larger amount of bound methanol molecules and stronger interaction between methanol molecules and the background of polymer within sPEES membranes compared to that in Nafion.

30|$|The present work {{is aimed}} at {{investigating}} the mechanical and in vitro biological properties of <b>polyphenylene</b> ether ether <b>sulfone</b> (PPEES)/nanohydroxyapatite (nHA) composite fibers. Electrospinning was used to prepare nanofiber composite mats of PPEES/nHA with different weight percentages of the inorganic filler, nHA. The fabricated composites were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)-attenuated total reflectance spectroscopy (ATR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) techniques. The mechanical properties of the composite were studied with a tensile tester. The FTIR-ATR spectrum depicted the functional group {{as well as the}} interaction between the PPEES and nHA composite materials; in addition, the elemental groups were identified with EDX analysis. The morphology of the nanofiber composite was studied by SEM. Tensile strength analysis of the PPEES/nHA composite revealed the elastic nature of the nanofiber composite reinforced with nHA and suggested significant mechanical strength of the composite. The biomineralization studies performed using simulated body fluid with increased incubation time showed enhanced mineralization, which showed that the composites possessed high bioactivity property.

The crystallization kinetics of PPS/PPSS blends was also studied {{as a function of}} molar composition. The PPS/PPSS and PPS/PPSE blends are respectively partially and fully miscible. PPSE shows a plasticizing effect on PPS as does PPS on PPSS, which necessarily improves the processibility in the respective systems. We can control T-g and melting temperature T-m of PPS by varying amounts of PPSE in blends. The melt crystallization temperature T-mc of PPS/PPSE blends was higher than that of the PPSE homopolymer. Therefore, these blends require shorter cycle times in processing than pure PPSE. The overall rate of crystallization for PPS/PPSS blends follows the Avrami equation with an exponent similar or equal to 2. The maximal rate of crystallization for PPS/PPSS blends occurs at a temperature higher by 10 degrees C than that for PPS, while the crystallization half time t(1 / 2) is 4 times shorter. In the cold crystallization range, crystal growth rates increase and Avrami exponents decrease significantly as the temperature increasesclose...|$|R
