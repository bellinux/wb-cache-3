Target detection relies only on an emitter having sufficient power and being within Kolchuga's frequency range. Target identification, however, is more complex {{and is based on}} the measurement of different parameters of the transmitted signal - such as its frequency, bandwidth, pulse width, <b>pulse</b> <b>repetition</b> <b>interval,</b> etc. Kolchuga has been reported to use around forty different parameters when identifying a target. These parameters are compared to a database in order to identify both the type of emitter and, in some cases, even the specific piece of equipment (by identifying the unique signature or [...] "fingerprint" [...] that most transmitters have, due to the variations and tolerances in individual components).

We find that the intercept time for arbitrary starting phases is an inhomogeneous Diophantine approximation problem which can be solved in a similar manner.
