5000|$|The {{first round}} was usually a {{head-to-head}} competition played under a 30 or 60-second time limit. Usually, both dogs received points {{based on their}} performance, with the better-performing dog earning an additional ten points. For example, in one event, the dogs went down a line of doggy treats (on <b>pie</b> <b>plates),</b> and for each one eaten, they would get 2 points, with a 10-point bonus for the dog who could eat more of them faster. One notable exception was [...] "Doggie Bag," [...] in which the dogs and masters climbed into a large cloth bag and exchanged T-shirts; the team that first emerged from the bag within the 60 seconds won 20 points.|$|R

50|$|Vast claybeds {{were found}} {{and the first}} pottery was built by Fisk and Smith in 1829 south of Mogadore. Within a few years twenty one potteries sprang up around the village. Millions of gallons of the finest {{stoneware}} were manufactured and shipped out on the Ohio canal. By 1870, the clay industry employed 700 men making crocks, bricks, churns, <b>pie</b> <b>plates,</b> sewer pipes, jugs, vases, urns and many other specialty products. The quality of the stoneware had achieved an international reputation for quality. The unique clay qualities produced wares with durability comparable to cast iron vessels. Eventually glass and tin containers were favored over the heavy crockery thus ending the era of an industry noted for fine quality and craftsmanship. Today, any pottery with a Mogadore stamp is highly coveted on the antiques market.|$|R
2500|$|A less seriously themed {{group was}} named the Esoteric and Terrible Order of Pie Eaters, which was a {{fraternity}} formed in 1868 {{in response to the}} Members of the Grange fraternity, which was more serious and exclusionary, and well known for eating cake. The Old Depot museum claimed that the views of the Pie Eaters fraternity were more far reaching than simply making fun of the Grangers, saying they also “had grand plans of doing away with currency and paying with pieces of glass, banishing all women to New Jersey, and achieving world domination while wearing <b>pie</b> <b>plates</b> around their necks and calling each other by titles like the ‘Grand Gyrasticutas’ and the ‘Grand Gabster.’" [...] The museum hosted an event that included many of the Pie Eaters secret initiations, and served several types of pie.|$|R

A meal {{had been prepared}} for 15 labourers near the hospital gates; although generally hospital staff restrained Tarrare {{in the presence of}} food, on this occasion Courville allowed him to reach the table undisturbed. Tarrare ate the entire meal of two large meat <b>pies,</b> <b>plates</b> of grease and salt and four gallons of milk, and then immediately fell asleep; Courville noted that Tarrare's belly became taut and inflated like a large balloon. On another occasion Tarrare was presented with a live cat. He tore the cat's abdomen open with his teeth and drank its blood, and proceeded to eat the entire cat aside from its bones, before vomiting up its fur and skin. Following this, hospital staff offered Tarrare a variety of other animals including snakes, lizards and puppies, all of which were eaten; he also swallowed an entire eel without chewing, having first crushed its head with his teeth.|$|R

5000|$|Taylor {{explained}} that he had run for public office without the hairpiece and found that voters [...] "didn't have much use for bald politicians", but [...] "I ran the fourth time with it and won." [...] His original toupée was made from a tin <b>pie</b> <b>plate,</b> which he lined with pink felt and swatches of human hair. In 1958, he was granted a patent (#2,850,023) for his innovative product. Glen and Dora Taylor were successful manufacturing hair pieces, and Taylor Toppers became famous. The company, now known as Taylormade Hair Replacement, is still active in Millbrae.|$|E
5000|$|A Corning {{executive}} {{gave the}} following {{account of the}} etymology of the name [...] "Pyrex": The word PYREX is probably a purely arbitrary word which was devised in 1915 as a trade-mark for products manufactured and sold by Corning Glass Works. While some people have {{thought that it was}} made up from the Greek pyr and the Latin rex we have always taken the position that no graduate of Harvard would be guilty of such a classical hybrid. Actually, we had a number of prior trade-marks ending in the letters ex. One of the first commercial products to be sold under the new mark was a <b>pie</b> <b>plate</b> and in the interests of euphonism the letter r was inserted between pie and ex and the whole thing condensed to PYREX.|$|E
5000|$|Arnold {{originally}} {{described the}} objects' shape as [...] "flat like a pie pan", [...] "shaped like a pie plate", [...] "half-moon shaped, oval {{in front and}} convex in the rear", [...] "something like a <b>pie</b> <b>plate</b> that was cut in half {{with a sort of}} a convex triangle in the rear", or simply [...] "saucer-like" [...] or [...] "like a big flat disk" [...] (see quotes), and also described their erratic motion being [...] "like a fish flipping in the sun" [...] or a saucer skipped across water. From these, the press quickly coined the new terms [...] "flying saucer" [...] and [...] "flying disc" [...] to describe such objects, many of which were reported within days after Arnold's sighting. Later Arnold would add that one of the objects actually resembled a crescent or flying wing.|$|E

50|$|It would appear, {{according}} to Serge Mol, that tales of samurai breaking open a kabuto (helmet) are more folklore than anything else. The hachi (helmet bowl) {{is the central}} component of a kabuto; it is made of <b>pie</b> piece-shaped <b>plates</b> of steel or iron riveted together at the sides {{and at the top}} to a large, thick grommet of sorts (called a tehen-no-kanamono), and at the bottom to a metal strip that encircles the hachi. This would require enormous pressure to split open. This idea that the kabutowari was somehow able to smash or damage a helmet kabuto is most probably a misinterpretation of the name which could have several meanings, as hachi could mean skull or helmet bowl and wari could mean, split, rip, crack or smash.|$|R
5000|$|Lehman was {{motivated}} {{to experiment with}} side-firing after visiting the studio of Shoji Takahara in Japan, who encouraged him to become acquainted with Pennsylvania potter Jack Troy. With Troy, Lehman writes, [...] "I had {{the first of several}} experiences wood-firing anagama-style kilns. The exuberance of the four-day firings; the altered shapes propelled by the pyroplasticity of the clay; the expressions of kinetic energy exuded by the ash runs, drips and pools - all these new experiences convinced me that pursuit of my dream would inescapably lead to my own anagama-style kiln. This kiln is described under Long-Wood-Firing, but an additional development was the technique of side-fired glazed ware.At a time when he was without access to a large wood-burning kiln, Lehman had become more and more transfixed on the idea of making pots that displayed the ‘kinetic’ qualities of molten ash that he had seen in Japan. In particular he had seen wares from Shigaraki with their emerald-green ash runs and pyroclastic bulges, effects that he was later to achieve in ‘long’ firings.... Lehman devised a system of firing his pieces suspended upon ‘one-time use’ clay tripods that provided space between the underside of the piece and the kiln shelf and a means of capturing any glaze drips that might otherwise have damaged the shelf. The pots were dipped into a single carbon-trapping Shino glaze before being set on their sides. Ash, combined with other fluxes, is sieved directly onto the wet glaze. During the firing the ash melts to form rivulets of glaze that ‘wrap’ the pot as string might wrap a parcel. The ‘dragonfly eye’ is left untouched, a central focal point. The intricate, complex surfaces of the pots belie the modesty of their firing - fired as they are alongside casseroles, pitchers and <b>pie</b> <b>plates</b> in a regular 12-hour cone 9 reduction firing.- Phil Rogers in Ash Glazes, second edition, A&C Black (London) University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia, 2003, pp.129-131.|$|R
