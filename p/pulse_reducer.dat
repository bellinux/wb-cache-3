40|$|Pulse {{reducers}} provide {{intermittent motion}} or continuous movement with predetermined non-uniformity and high reduction ratio. The {{aim of the}} research is to study the dynamics of new compact construction of <b>pulse</b> <b>reducer.</b> Reducer's mathematical model consisting of three systems of differential equations is developed. Systems of equations are related to each other through temporal parameters as integration limits on corresponding periods of links movement. Feature of mathematical model developing of this design reducer as a transmission with variable structure during the cycle is in coincidence of periods of holders joint motion for one freewheeling mechanism (FWM) and in independent motion of holders for another FWM Movement dynamics research of <b>pulse</b> <b>reducer</b> links are conducted for successive periods of FWM’s jamming, for joint motion of holders and their independent movement. Dynamic characteristics and law of motion of reducer’s links are defined. Numerical analysis of construction and inertial characteristics and their impact on reducer’s dynamic characteristics became possible on the basis of developed mathematical model...|$|E
