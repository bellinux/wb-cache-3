5|$|Two {{sections}} of the province are not dominated by forest. The province's northeast corner bordering Hudson Bay is above the treeline and is considered tundra. The tallgrass <b>prairie</b> once dominated the south central and southeastern parts including the Red River Valley. Mixed grass <b>prairie</b> {{is found in the}} southwestern region. Agriculture has replaced much of the natural <b>prairie</b> but <b>prairie</b> still can be found in parks and protected areas; some are notable for the presence of the endangered western <b>prairie</b> fringed orchid,.|$|E
5|$|The state holds {{populations of}} white-tailed deer, mule deer, antelope, coyotes, {{mountain}} lions, bobcats, elk, and birds such as quail, doves, cardinals, bald eagles, red-tailed hawks, and pheasants. In <b>prairie</b> ecosystems, American bison, greater <b>prairie</b> chickens, badgers, and armadillo are common, {{and some of}} the nation's largest <b>prairie</b> dog towns inhabit shortgrass <b>prairie</b> in the state's panhandle. The Cross Timbers, a region transitioning from <b>prairie</b> to woodlands in Central Oklahoma, harbors 351 vertebrate species. The Ouachita Mountains are home to black bear, red fox, grey fox, and river otter populations, which coexist with 328 vertebrate species in southeastern Oklahoma. Also, in southeastern Oklahoma lives the American alligator.|$|E

5|$|By 1911, {{warehouses}} and factories cramped the <b>Prairie</b> Avenue District. Large industry overtook the district by 1950.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} floristic study of coastal terrace <b>prairies</b> in central California that are poorly described in California’s ecological literature. Definitive native grasses include Danthonia californica, Nassella pulchra, and Festuca rubra. Definitive native forbs include Baccharis pilularis, Viola, Sidalcea, Cammisonia and Acaena. Species richness {{in the coastal}} <b>prairies</b> (1 m 2) averaged 22. 6, nearly twice that of relatively diverse serpentine California grasslands, and other North American grasslands. We sampled 33 coastal <b>prairies</b> and found 340 plant species including 258 forbs. Nearby plant communities (Monterey Pine, Coastal Scrub) had much lower species diversity at all spatial scales studied. Three distinct coastal grasslands, each associated with a land form, can be defined by distinct species composition; coastal terraces, uplifted “bald hills ” and inland ridges. We compared 29 coastal terrace <b>prairies</b> (those without tree or shrubs) to 80 inland Nassella <b>prairies</b> with regard to 27 floristic variables (cover, number of natives/exotics, perennials/annuals, grasses/forbs) along a gradient from interior-coastal valley and {{from north to south}} along the coast. Coastal terrace <b>prairies</b> were invaded by exotics, but far less so than inland Nassella <b>prairies.</b> Species diversity (0. 1 ha) and total cover were positively correlated.

5|$|Due to Oklahoma's {{location}} at {{the confluence of}} many geographic regions, the state's climatic regions have {{a high rate of}} biodiversity. Forests cover 24 percent of Oklahoma and <b>prairie</b> grasslands composed of shortgrass, mixed-grass, and tallgrass <b>prairie,</b> harbor expansive ecosystems in the state's central and western portions, although cropland has largely replaced native grasses. Where rainfall is sparse in the state's western regions, shortgrass <b>prairie</b> and shrublands are the most prominent ecosystems, though pinyon pines, red cedar (junipers), and ponderosa pines grow near rivers and creek beds in the panhandle's far western reaches. Southwestern Oklahoma contains many rare, disjunct species including sugar maple, bigtooth maple, nolina and Southern live oak.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a large scale}} vision for a system of unplowed remnant <b>prairies</b> in pioneer cemeteries in east-central Illinois, focusing on sites between the city of Danville {{and the town of}} Paxton. The objective of the thesis is to protect the remnants by cultivating place attachment among locals and visitors by providing information about the ecological and cultural significance of cemetery <b>prairies.</b> The strategy is to create unique opportunities for experiencing individual sites while associating those settings through a trail concept (a network of cemetery <b>prairies),</b> with the primary purpose of helping to protect isolated remnant <b>prairies.</b> Linking the sites through a designed trail, wayfinding elements, and a brochure elevates the individual significance of the small patches that would otherwise fade into history. Such a network could also create opportunities to extend the <b>prairies,</b> allowing them to flourish once again on a larger scale than at present. This project will cover the ecological and social benefits of such a proposal and will suggest how this concept can be expanded to cemetery and site development in general. Finally, site specific redesigns will be presented that consider alternative approaches to remnant cemetery <b>prairies...</b>|$|R
