All <b>pelleted</b> <b>feeds</b> were similar in nutrient composition; however, the commercial moose feeds had higher percentages of fiber, due to a higher cellulose (and in the European pellets also hemicellulose) content.

Due to their high cellulose content, they even had lower lignin:cellulose-ratios than the other feeds and therefore rather resembled grass than browse in their fiber composition.

One example of intensive rabbit keeping may be a household rabbitry of a buck and two does, set under protection from the sun and with a windbreak, where each rabbit had their own cage and are fed fodder that is gathered by family members from the yard or roadside. Another might be a barn that is completely enclosed and climate controlled, to include constant air exchange, where several hundred individually housed does are fed a complete pelleted ration and are subject to weekly weight checks and daily health inspections. While a small rabbitry may make use of solid floors, wire or slat floors are more common in larger barns in order to ensure adequate hygiene.

40|$|The major {{objective}} of poultry feeding is {{the conversion of}} feedstuff into human food. The economic importance of poultry feeding, becomes apparent when it is realized that 60 - 70 % of the total production cost of poultry production is feed. For this reason, the efficient use of feed is extremely important in broiler production. The {{objective of}} this research was to review connections between grinding and the pelleting process, and to describe how digestion processes in poultry were influenced by mash or <b>pelleted</b> <b>feed.</b> This literature showed that that energy consumption is a highly relevant factor of economy of feed industry, and that it is affected by grinding. Thus, main criterions for evaluating optimal particle size in feed were both biotic and economic factors. Comparisons were done with mash and <b>pelleted</b> <b>feed.</b> Mash diet gives greater unification of growth, lower mortality and requires lower use of energy, making it more economical. Poultry has preferences for bigger particles size, so <b>pelleted</b> <b>feed</b> increases feed intake relative to mash. <b>Pelleted</b> <b>feed</b> also results in lower percentage of waste in feeding, and is also easier to handle, transport and store. On the other side, <b>pelleted</b> <b>feed</b> is about 10 % more expensive than the other which are not pelleted, largely due to higher energy consumption during production. Recommendations regarding optimum particle size, however, have been contradictory, as the results from feeding trials and different experiments are confounded by a number of factors, including feed physical form, complexity of the diet, grain type, endosperm hardness, grinding method, pellet quality and particle size distribution. On each of this factors possibilities to influence on them are always existing. On the end, however, <b>pelleted</b> <b>feed</b> seems to have more advantages than disadvantages.
