500|$|A set {{of methods}} to produce MSAs while {{reducing}} the errors inherent in <b>progressive</b> <b>methods</b> {{are classified as}} [...] "iterative" [...] because they work similarly to <b>progressive</b> <b>methods</b> but repeatedly realign the initial sequences as well as adding new sequences to the growing MSA. One reason <b>progressive</b> <b>methods</b> are so strongly dependent on a high-quality initial alignment {{is the fact that}} these alignments are always incorporated into the final result— that is, once a sequence has been aligned into the MSA, its alignment is not considered further. This approximation improves efficiency at the cost of accuracy. By contrast, iterative methods can return to previously calculated pairwise alignments or sub-MSAs incorporating subsets of the query sequence as a means of optimizing a general objective function such as finding a high-quality alignment score.|$|R

40|$|The primary {{aim of the}} study, is to {{investigate}} teachers’ views about what {{is necessary for the}} effective use of <b>progressive</b> <b>methods</b> in the teaching of history. It argues that the mere adoption of procedures associated with <b>progressive</b> <b>methods</b> in teaching without awareness of the essentials for using them' does not lead to the expected results. The study draws its research from two high schools in the Manzini Region in Swaziland, and concludes that even though teachers were using a terminology of <b>progressive</b> <b>methods</b> when talking about their teaching strategies, they were unaware of the essential skills related to such terminology, anJ subsequently could not encourage the development of such skills. Their {{understanding of the nature of}} history as a discipline and its value as a school subject is also identified as limited. The study recommends that for teachers to overcome these shortcomings, they need to be part of the discourses that defines their discipline and the discussions on what is essential for the teaching of history...|$|R

40|$|Active {{learning}} and <b>progressive</b> <b>methods</b> have since the 1930 s had, {{and still have}} a strong position in Norwegian National Curriculum Plans and have also influenced the curriculum plans for teacher education. A number of studies, however, have demonstrated that students, having acquired positive attitudes towards such methods during their training, turn to more traditional teaching quite soon after becoming certificated teachers. This tendency among new teachers is explained with the need for control, the lack of essential skills and routines and the overriding need to be perceived as competent in their new school. Few students, report that they have experienced <b>progressive</b> <b>methods</b> during their practice periods. Mostly, they have met the same traditional methods which they experienced as pupils themselves. (Solsta...|$|R

The family lived briefly in Heysham, Lancashire, and Ramsey, Isle of Man during the 1880s. [...] "John H. E. Partington was a great lover of travel and moved his family so often that no formal schooling was possible. He solved his children's education by training them himself.
