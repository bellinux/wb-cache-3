Brătianu — {{who was elected}} to the new office of PNL vice {{president}} on 10 January 1938. After the failure of Goga's policies to curb the rise of their competitors, the king, backed by Tătărescu, resorted to dissolving all political <b>parties</b> <b>on</b> 30 May 1938, creating instead the National Renaissance Front.|$|E
5|$|Fraser chaired {{a summit}} of {{leaders of the}} Coalition <b>parties</b> <b>on</b> 2 November. The {{resulting}} communiqué urged the Coalition senators to continue deferring supply. It also threatened, should Kerr grant Whitlam a half-Senate election, that the Coalition state premiers would advise their governors not to issue writs, thus blocking the election from {{taking place in the}} four states with non-Labor premiers. After the meeting, Fraser proposed a compromise: that the Opposition would concede supply if Whitlam agreed to hold a House of Representatives election {{at the same time as}} the half-Senate election. Whitlam rejected the idea.|$|E
5|$|Members {{are able}} to sit {{anywhere}} in the debating chamber, but typically sit in their party groupings. The First Minister, Scottish cabinet ministers and Law officers {{sit in the front}} row, in the middle section of the chamber.

His nomination to that position was proposed by the red-green <b>parties.</b> <b>On</b> January 23, 2012, Hareide denounced a speech at KrF's local chapter in Sarpsborg that had suggested that the terrorist attacks and the Alexander Kielland disaster were divine warnings or punishments for Norway's policy towards Israel; Hareide {{said that this was}} far beyond normal thinking and completely out of line with the party's values.|$|E
5|$|On the 1895 Mazamas expedition, {{the first}} {{heliography}} between {{several of the}} peaks of the Cascades was attempted with some success.

5|$|The {{following}} day, army forces {{stationed in}} the Pearl Roundabout fired live ammunition on hundreds of protesters who tried to re-occupy the site.

5|$|As the American Civil War approached, Colt {{supplied}} {{both the}} North and the South with firearms. He {{had been known}} to sell weapons to warring <b>parties</b> <b>on</b> both sides of other conflicts in Europe and saw no difference {{with respect to the}} war in America. In 1859 Colt considered building an armory in the South and as late as 1861 had sold 2,000 revolvers to Confederate agent John Forsyth. Although trade with the South had not been restricted at that time, newspapers such as the New York Daily Tribune, the New York Times and the Hartford Daily Courant labeled him a Southern sympathizer and traitor to the Union. In response to these charges, Colt was commissioned as a colonel by the state of Connecticut on May 16, 1861, in the 1st Regiment Colts Revolving Rifles of Connecticut armed with the Colt revolving rifle. Colt envisioned this unit as being staffed by men over six feet tall and armed with his weapons. However, the unit never took the field and Colt was discharged on June 20, 1861.|$|E

5|$|By then, Exton had in turn {{been elected}} Mayor. Although {{for a while}} he and Brembre worked {{together}} in running London, when his predecessor fell from influence, Exton effectively deserted him, {{even to the point of}} being partially responsible for Brembre's eventual hanging. Exton's primary policy throughout his two periods as Mayor was probably based on a desire to maintain the city's neutrality between the feuding <b>parties.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, he appears to have personally profited from the Appellants' period of rule, and it seems that there was some dissatisfaction with him in London, even if he was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing by parliament. His later years are as obscure as his youth; known to have married at least twice, he seems to have had no children, and died in 1402 at an unknown age.|$|E
5|$|French {{casualties}} {{are hard}} to calculate, as the best available source is the vague totals submitted by Duckworth in his account to the Admiralty. He estimates, apparently based on reports by the senior remaining French officers on Alexandre, Jupiter and Brave, that those three ships suffered 760 casualties in total. These accounts were subsequently called into question by historian William James, who considered them too high. James also criticised the assumed totals for Impérial and Diomède, which are even less certain but reportedly totalled 500 and 250 respectively. In addition to those killed and wounded, the entire surviving crews of Alexandre, Jupiter and Brave were taken prisoner, as were 150 men from Diomède and six from Impérial seized by British boarding <b>parties</b> <b>on</b> 8 February.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, the {{government}} of the Socialist Republic of Croatia decided to tolerate political parties in response to growing demands to allow political activities outside the Communist party. The first political party founded in Croatia {{since the beginning of the}} Communist rule was the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS), established on 20 May 1989, followed by the Croatian Democratic Union on 17 June 1989. In December 1989, Ivica Račan became the head of the reformed Communist party. At the same time, the party cancelled political trials, released political prisoners and endorsed a multi-party political system. The Civil Organisations Act was formally amended to allow political <b>parties</b> <b>on</b> 11 January 1990, legalising the parties that were already founded.|$|E

5|$|Interested <b>parties</b> <b>on</b> {{both sides}} filed amici. A group of {{conservative}} Republicans {{in both houses}} of Congress, including Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey, Henry Hyde and Rick Santorum, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children both argued for affirming the conviction, pointing to the invaluable nature of undercover investigations in fighting child pornography, worrying that requiring reasonable suspicion beforehand could make such operations impossible. Americans for Effective Law Enforcement said there had been no entrapment and that reasonable suspicion was not required before starting investigations such as Looking Glass. The American Civil Liberties Union, its Nebraska chapter and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers weighed in on Jacobson's behalf.|$|E
5|$|Later, in July, as Axis forces {{launched}} an offensive in the Western Desert that threatened Egypt, during the First Battle of El Alamein the {{units of the}} 9th Division were moved back to North Africa to help stem the advance. The 2/17th Battalion subsequently carried out a blocking operation and then occupied a position around Tel el Eisa, from where it conducted patrols and observed German movements. In September, the 2/17th was relieved by the 2/15th Battalion, and went into reserve around Shammama to prepare for further operations. The battalion was subsequently tasked with active patrolling in the area, and clashed with German <b>parties</b> <b>on</b> a number of occasions, while its positions were also heavily shelled {{on a number of}} occasions which resulted in a few casualties. Meanwhile, several exercises and other training was undertaken prior to the upcoming offensive. During this time it had an effective strength of 30 officers and 731 other ranks.|$|E
5|$|Longleat Estate has fenced off a {{large part}} of its land and has {{introduced}} goats, as part of a programme to encourage the biodiversity of the area; the goats were intended to replace the sheep that grazed in the gorge until the 1970s. The National Trust announced in March 2007 that it plans to release a flock of sheep on its side of the gorge for the same purpose, but will first consult local residents and interested <b>parties</b> <b>on</b> whether to fence off the gorge or introduce cattle grids to prevent the sheep from straying. There is already a small flock of feral Soay sheep in the gorge.|$|E
50|$|Further to this {{functional}} deficiency, was a twofold practical deficiency. For {{though one}} {{was only to}} answer one's own ringing code, every <b>party</b> <b>on</b> the same subscriber line could hear all the ringing codes. This meant firstly, frequently ringing telephones were a disruptive annoyance, as each <b>party</b> <b>on</b> the line had to stop to listen every time the telephone rang {{in order to determine}} according to the ringing cadence if they were the <b>party</b> being called <b>on</b> any given ring. Secondly, if any <b>party</b> <b>on</b> a given line should so be inclined, there was the insidious opportunity to listen in on other parties' calls.|$|R
