50|$|A Ward Leonard {{control is}} usually used for {{controlling}} a shunt or compound wound DC motor, and {{developed as a}} method of providing a speed-controlled motor from an AC supply, though it is not without its advantages in DC schemes. The AC supply is used to drive an AC motor, usually an induction motor that drives a DC generator or dynamo. The DC output from the armature is directly connected to the armature of the DC motor (sometimes but not always of identical construction). The shunt field windings of both DC machines are independently excited through variable resistors. Extremely good speed control from standstill to full speed, and consistent torque, can be obtained by varying the generator and/or motor field current. This method of control was the de facto method from its development until it was superseded by solid state thyristor systems. It found service in almost any environment where good speed control was required, from passenger lifts through to large mine pit head winding gear and even industrial <b>process</b> <b>machinery</b> and electric cranes. Its principal disadvantage was that three machines were required to implement a scheme (five in very large installations, as the DC machines were often duplicated and controlled by a tandem variable resistor). In many applications, the motor-generator set was often left permanently running, to avoid the delays that would otherwise be caused by starting it up as required. Although electronic (thyristor) controllers have replaced most small to medium Ward-Leonard systems, some very large ones (thousands of horsepower) remain in service. The field currents are much lower than the armature currents, allowing a moderate sized thyristor unit to control a much larger motor than it could control directly. For example, in one installation, a 300 amp thyristor unit controls the field of the generator. The generator output current is in excess of 15,000 amperes, which would be prohibitively expensive (and inefficient) to control directly with thyristors.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{argue that}} {{irregular}} geometrical patterns of industrial premises and {{items of the}} <b>process</b> <b>machinery</b> installed in industrial premises cause redistribution of the acoustic energy and its essential acoustic properties, including the average free path length, the reverberation time, and the average sound absorption coefficient. Any failure {{to take account of}} the above influence causes errors in identification of the sound pressure intensity and in assessment of efficiency of design and acoustics-related actions aimed at noise reduction that incorporate sound-proof facing. The authors present the results of simulation of acoustic processes in the premises that have items of <b>process</b> <b>machinery</b> installed, and analyze their influence on the sound absorption intensity. The software developed {{on the basis of the}} beam tracing method is designated to assess the influence of patterns of arrangement of items of equipment onto acoustic parameters of premises. The software comprises independent modules designated for the simulation of acoustic processes in different premises that demonstrate different acoustic properties. The results of the research demonstrate that the software simulation of noise processes on the basis of the method of beam tracing is an effective tool that may be effectively applied in the analysis of noise patterns inside industrial premises. The software may be employed to identify integrated acoustic patterns inside industrial premises with account for the influence of dimensions of premises, characteristics of items of <b>process</b> <b>machinery</b> capable of disseminating sounds, etc. and other factors of signifi cance in terms of the distribution of reflected sound energy.

40|$|Abstract The Finnish {{chemical}} {{forest industry}} {{has undergone a}} profound structural change {{over the past two}} decades. The basic industry is increasingly focusing its product development investments on its own products and operations while the development of processes and <b>process</b> <b>machinery</b> is left to specialised companies. At the same time the purchases of the pulp and paper industry are becoming larger: there is a shift from single device purchases to larger functional units. This research studies the Finnish <b>process</b> <b>machinery</b> industry serving the needs of the pulp and paper industry and its product development environment and strategies, and evaluates the ability of selected case companies to design integrated process solutions. Particularly the role of measurement and automation technology in these solutions is under closer scrutiny. Aspects of product life cycles and technology management, together with various procedures and operating models for innovation and product development processes, are discussed {{on the basis of the}} literature. The empirical part of the research was carried out as a case study with several Finnish companies manufacturing machinery and equipment for the chemical forest industry. The results show that the strategies of the studied industry are still very much dominated by the traditional emphasis on machinery design and construction. The change in the customers' purchasing behaviour towards ever larger units and functions is reflected particularly as increasingly large delivery projects. The units required by the customers are put together in the project phase, using parts and components developed in isolation from each other. There is very little evidence of actual product development, design or producing of integrated process solutions. In those cases where the design work has explicitly aimed at an integrated functional unit, the result has been a process that the customer can easily purchase and where the supplier's expertise in processes and process control is already included in the package. Designing integrated process solutions takes more than technical expertise and capability: the strategy, organisation, and product development process of the supplier company must support the integration of different technologies and expertise areas in the product. Instead of the traditional serial product development it is imperative that the questions of process design, <b>process</b> <b>machinery,</b> and process control are treated and solved simultaneously. The in-house expertise and networking of research and development must be promoted in such a way that the capabilities necessary to include the required technologies and expertise areas in a product project are already available when the product is being specified and designed...|$|E

40|$|Cryogenics is {{now widely}} present in large {{accelerator}} projects using applied superconductivity.

One way to do this consists to lower their operating temperature and to cool them with superfluid helium.
