50|$|A <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> is a {{computer}} input device {{used in conjunction with}} {{a computer}}'s CRT display. It is used to select a displayed menu item. A <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> can also allow users draw on the screen with great positional accuracy. It consists of a photocell and an optical system placed in a small tube. When the tip of a <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> is moved over the monitor screen and pen button is pressed, its photocell sensing element detects the screen location and sends the corresponding signal to the CPU. The first <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> was created around 1952 as part of the Whirlwind project at MIT. Because the user was required to hold his/her arm in front of the screen for long periods of time, the <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> fell out of use as a general purpose input device.|$|R
50|$|The XG-1 {{is simply}} a {{specialized}} <b>light</b> <b>pen.</b> <b>Light</b> <b>pen</b> support was built into the earliest Atari computers, but it never really caught on. In fact, all lightgun games for the XEGS could be played with the <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> and vice versa. Many users complained of horrible accuracy of the device, especially {{when compared to the}} NES Zapper. Some XEGS users preferred to rewire the Sega Master System Light Phaser for use.|$|R
50|$|Lundin wrote {{games in}} Fortran and Assembler and Goran in COBOL to {{demonstrate}} the API for programmers. To model IBM's new <b>light</b> <b>pen,</b> programmers contributed a simple tic-tac-toe (noughts and crosses), possibly the only practical use of the subsequently discontinued <b>light</b> <b>pen.</b>|$|R
50|$|The PCjr {{also has}} a <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> port. Besides being used for a <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> (a rarely {{purchased}} option), this port was used {{in combination with the}} serial port to supply voltage to a Mouse Systems optical mouse of the same design as those for Sun workstations.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Light</b> <b>pens</b> were {{directly}} supported as well. In {{this case a}} photosensor in the <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> {{was connected to the}} trigger line of the port. If placed in <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> mode, whenever the trigger was seen to go high, the OS would copy the color clock value into the [...] register to record the horizontal position, and the [...] register of the video hardware into the [...] register. The result was a set of two eight-bit values directly encoding the position of the pen in X and Y using the same coordinates as the video hardware. A sprite can then be set to those coordinates and will appear under the <b>light</b> <b>pen.</b> As the timers were not very accurate, the positions had to be averaged over several screens to produce a usable value.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Light</b> <b>pen</b> usage was {{expanded}} {{in the early}} 1980s to personal computers such as the Fairlight CMI, and the BBC Micro.

50|$|MicroAngelo also {{supported}} a <b>light</b> <b>pen,</b> connected through input terminals {{on the top}} of the card. The Screenware software automatically converted the coordinates into the card's coordinates. Screenware also included routines for drawing movable cursors in hardware (as opposed to bit bliting), and the cursor could be made to follow the <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> simply by reading the pen coordinates and feeding them into the cursor.|$|R

The right monitor, which played the preview video, was used by the editor to make cuts and edit decisions, by using the <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> to select from options which were superimposed as text over the preview video.

5000|$|A <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> is {{a device}} {{similar to a}} touch screen, but uses a special {{light-sensitive}} pen instead of the finger, which allows for more accurate screen input. As {{the tip of the}} <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> makes contact with the screen, it sends a signal back to the computer containing the coordinates of the pixels at that point. It can be used to draw on the computer screen or make menu selections, and does not require a special touch screen because it can work with any CRT display.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{portable}} three-dimensional vision coordinate {{measuring system}} is proposed in this paper. It {{consists of a}} <b>light</b> <b>pen,</b> a CCD camera and a laptop computer. The <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> is a hand-held probe with three point light sources using LEDs and a spherical touch stylus arranged in one line. The CCD camera takes the image of LEDs on the <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> and the 3 D coordinates of measured point {{at the center of}} touch stylus are obtained by computing the positions of LEDs in the image when the probe contacts the object surface. The equations of the vision measurement system are derived by using perspective of three collinear points and spatial analytic geometry. The measuring device can be set up easily on an industrial site and the measurement is convenient. The object surface can be simple, complex, or hidden from the view of camera. The effectiveness of the mathematical model and validity of the measuring system are confirmed by experiments...|$|R

5000|$|FRESS was a {{continuation}} of work done on van Dam's previous hypertext system, HES, developed the previous year. FRESS ran on an IBM 360-series mainframe running VM/CMS. It improved on HES's capabilities in many ways, inspired by Douglas Engelbart's NLS. FRESS implemented {{one of the first}} virtual terminal interfaces, in order to provide device-independence. It could run on various terminals from dumb typewriters up to the Imlac PDS-1 graphical minicomputer. On the PDS-1, it supported multi-window WYSIWYG editing and graphics display. The PDS-1 used a <b>light</b> <b>pen,</b> not a mouse, and the <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> could be [...] "clicked" [...] using a foot-pedal.|$|R
50|$|The IBM design used a {{capacitance}} {{screen with}} a metal pencil for input, providing a directly read X and Y coordinate. The basic system was similar to modern touch screen systems like the iPhone, but not sensitive enough to detect a finger and instead required a wired conductor to complete the circuit. The pencil replaced the <b>light</b> <b>pens</b> because it was much faster to decode; a <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> {{had to wait for}} a pulse of light when a vector was being redrawn and then work its way through the list of vectors to find out which one was selected.|$|R
