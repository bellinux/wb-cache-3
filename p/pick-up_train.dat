50|$|After the USAAF {{departure}} {{the airfield}} {{was returned to}} RAF control. In March 1945 control passed to RAF Transport Command. The main activities continued to be production (Mosquitos) by Airspeed, radar trials and glider <b>pick-up</b> <b>training.</b> In January 1946 control of the airfield passed to the Ministry of Aircraft Production.|$|R
50|$|After {{closure of}} branch lines {{across the state}} and the end of short <b>pick-up</b> goods <b>trains,</b> use of the class dropped.|$|R
5000|$|Operationally, {{the traffic}} at Culworth {{was of the}} rural kind and {{relatively}} light. For passengers, only the Ordinary Passenger trains called; expresses passed through non-stop. The goods traffic was handled by <b>pick-up</b> <b>trains</b> between Woodford & Hinton and Quainton Road or Marylebone. As both traffics declined, Culworth {{became one of the}} first stations on the GC Extension to be closed to passenger traffic, on 24 September 1958, and finally to all traffic on 6 June 1962, after which the site reverted to agricultural use.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{a problem}} of forming the <b>pick-up</b> <b>trains</b> by conventional methods (the Futhner method and Special method), aiming at establishing basic characteristics of track facilities and values of shunting operations indicators important for evaluation {{of the effects of}} these methods application. The problem under consideration has so far not been examined in the literature to a sufficient extent, although in practice it has been proved to be necessary. For this reason, in this work a simulation study has been undertaken the results of which have to give the values and measures for assessing the quality of station/yard operations, as well as the assessment of new-designed station solutions...|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s, {{the line}} was fairly busy with both {{passenger}} and freight trains. Freight included cattle, milk, and general goods. One <b>pick-up</b> freight <b>train</b> per day, usually with a 52xx Class 2-6-2 Prairie tank locomotive in charge.|$|R
50|$|Both {{locomotives}} {{were placed}} in service in the Karoo, working between Touws River and Beaufort West. In their later years they were stationed at Worcester, from where they were used extensively on and around the Cape Western system’s mainline, working <b>pick-up</b> goods <b>trains</b> to De Doorns in the Hex River valley and on the Mosselbaai line via Robertson.|$|R
50|$|By June 1964, Greyville {{was still}} {{allocated}} nine Class GFs which were used mainly on local passenger and <b>pick-up</b> goods <b>trains.</b> Apart from four which were sold and two which were scrapped after collisions, the Class GF were all still in stock by 1972, {{although not all}} were still in operation. The last one in SAR service was scrapped in 1979.|$|R
50|$|Freight, {{which for}} many years during the 1950s {{consisted}} of a daily <b>pick-up</b> freight <b>train</b> between Norwich and Stowmarket, was finally withdrawn on 28 December 1964 and the goods sidings were all lifted the following year on 15 July 1965. The connections to the goods loops lasted until 5 June 1968 when the last points were removed and the signal box abolished.|$|R
5000|$|By 1926 two <b>pick-up</b> goods <b>trains</b> ran daily, in {{opposite}} directions, with crews swapping trains mid-journey. These were at times very well loaded, but the traffic only {{declined in the}} face of road competition. By the end there were only two pick-up goods per week, both poorly loaded. In the words of The Railway Magazine [...] "Two trains a day might have maintained the railway link ... two a week would not." ...|$|R
50|$|December 1890. A <b>pick-up</b> goods <b>train</b> {{was being}} shunted from the up line across the down line {{into the yard}} to bring out some laden trucks, when another goods train, coming from Abergavenny and bound for Newport, dashed into it and cut it in two. The {{accident}} {{was due to the}} steep gradient and' the inability of the driver of the through goods train to pull up in time to avert the mischief.|$|R
50|$|The {{line had}} a small siding at Harome between Nunnington and Helmsley which was {{installed}} in 1880. Originally the local population campaigned for a station, {{but it was never}} built. The siding was of a short length (41 yd) which could fit five standard length wagons and was just one line with a junction facing towards Gilling. Whenever traffic was to be forwarded, the farmers in the area would need to contact Helmsley to allow the <b>pick-up</b> goods <b>train</b> to call at the siding.|$|R
5000|$|Dakota III TS436 was {{assigned}} to the Glider <b>Pick-Up</b> <b>Training</b> Flt, whose role was to train crews in the 'snatch take-off method for retrieving gliders. Those on board were mostly returning to their base in Leicester, on completion of the course of instruction at Zeals. The aircraft took off at 1523 hours in conditions of broken cloud, with some patches down to 100 feet and generally overcast, a westerly wind at 10 mph and visibility of 1 to 2 miles at ground level. The pilot made a quarter circuit of the airfield and then set course to the north-east. Three minutes later whilst flying {{in and out of the}} broken cloud and whilst in level flight, the aircraft flew into a clump of 60-foot tall beech trees on top of a knoll. The impact ripped 10 feet off the port wing and the aircraft rolled to port, hit two more trees and then impaled itself on a cluster of four mature trees, caught fire and disintegrated, scattering wreckage over a distance of 300 yards on the far side of the knoll. Destruction of the aircraft was complete but investigation revealed the engines to have been at a high power setting on impact. The Accident Report, published on 17 May 45, suggests that the pilot who was the sole survivor, had failed to climb to a safe height when flying in poor visibility, although the knoll was a well known obstruction in close proximity to the airfield.|$|R
5000|$|Cost savings were {{attempted}} when {{a vehicle}} built for horse traction on the Leith {{branch of the}} Dalkeith line was tried on the North Berwick line. A pathway in {{the centre of the}} track had to be made for the horse, at a cost of £65. The passenger service was reduced to two return trips daily by the horse-drawn vehicle (referred to as [...] "the Dandy"), and the new arrangement started on 1 November 1856, as the winter traffic was light. The goods traffic on the branch was handled by the main line <b>pick-up</b> goods <b>train,</b> which now travelled up and down the branch as well; this disrupted and extended onward goods transits on the main line.|$|R
5000|$|On 30 June 2009 unit 507002 {{without a}} driver {{rolled out of}} Kirkdale TMD, derailing at a set of points further down. The incident, which caused {{disruption}} to many services, was caused by failure to apply the brakes [...] whilst maintenance was performed so that when isolating wooden paddles were removed from between the conductor rail and <b>pick-up</b> shoes, the <b>train</b> moved off without a driver on board. On 23 May 2011, it was announced by the Office of Rail Regulation that Merseyrail were fined £85,000 and ordered to pay legal costs of £20,970.15 due to the breach of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 leading to this incident.|$|R
