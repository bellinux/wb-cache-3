40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: the VIRIN-ENSh virus entomogenous preparation, the {{population}} of the unpair silkworm. The dependence of perception of the caterpillars of the unpair silkworm to the nuclear <b>polyedrosis</b> on the food breed of the vermins has been revealed; the possibilities of the preparation efficiency with use of the protective additives, prologing the preparation activity under the conditions of insolation, and antievaporators, increasing the economy of the processings, have been justified form the biological positions. The possibilities of the preparation efficiency increase have been justified by improving the tactics (the preparation flow rate in the forest with the aoks and birch predominance) and the technology (eth optimization of the composition and preparation recipe of the working mixtures). The recommendations on the efficiency increase of the VIRIN-ENSh preparation have been offered for introduction in the stations of the Russian Federation forest protection. The efficiency increase of the VIRIN-ENSh use against the unpair silkworm in the forests by prolonging the activity of the acting preparation in the nature, the differentiated preparation rate, the decrease of expenditures required for the performance of processings are the benefits of the workAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{pathogenicity}} {{of known}} and locally discovered strains of bacterial and fungal pathogens was studied. It {{was found that}} various concentrations of commercial preparation of B. thuringiensis (Bifiditermes beesoni and Heterotermes indicola. Other B. and Bectospeine) initiated mortality of odeontotermes obesus in the mounds. Histopathological studies showed that B. thuringiensis eroded epithelial cells of various portion of the guts in all the three species of termites. Various strains of B. thuringiensis such as HD- 201, 11 â€“ toumanoffi; HD- 224, 5 a, c-Canadensis and HD- 109, 6 -subtoxious were highly pathogenic to the nymphs of B. beesoni and workers of M. championi and H. indicola, respectively. A survey of pathogens, parasites and predators of termites {{was carried out in}} different ecological zones of Pakistan. the search for possible pathogens yielded seven bacteria (serratia marcescens, pseudomonas fluorescence, staphylococous aureus, citrobacter frundii, Ecterobacter aero genes, bacillus cereus, Bacillus thuringiensis); two fungi (A. flavus and aspergillus sp.) a probable cytoplasmic <b>polyedrosis</b> virus, a possible pathogenic nematode, microsporidia and a probable predatory mite. All these bacteria were pathogenic to M. championi, B. beesoni H. indicola. However, termites showed various degrees of susceptibility to each bacterial pathogen. The locally discovered Aspergillus and Aspergillus sp. Were highly pathogenic to m. chamioni, H. indicola and B. beesoni. Higher mortality of termites occurred when they were crawled on fungal culture for a longer period. Histopathological studies and B. beesoni was through integuments, their mycelia branched into the body cavity and attacked all the organs including the gangilion of the nierve cord. when the conidia entered the termites through oral rounded, they were seen trapped by cytoplasmic masses and atranda developing in the gizzards and guts of the termites concerned. Studies were conducted on the enhancement of pathogenicity of H. thuringiensis, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas fluorescens by gamma rays. The results showed that 72 hrs old and 60 or 70 irradiated cultures of B. thuringiensis, and 72 hrs old and 30 kr irradiated S. marcescens were more pathogenic than non-irradiated ones.
