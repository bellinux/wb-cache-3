25|$|Slater's career rose to {{new heights}} when he played the dark {{character}} J.D. in the 1989 film Heathers alongside Winona Ryder. Heathers was billed as the teen film of 1989, which {{had turned into a}} hit musical a year later. Slater beat out many other actors such as Brad Pitt for the part and his performance drew comparison with a young Jack Nicholson. After Heathers, Slater had offers to play more troubled youths, including as a rebellious teen in <b>Pump</b> <b>Up</b> <b>the</b> Volume (1990) and a wild gunman in Young Guns II (1990), in which Slater acted alongside Emilio Estevez and Kiefer Sutherland.|$|E
25|$|Among the 1960 season's {{highlights}} was the Gators' 18–17 {{upset of}} Dodd's tenth-ranked Yellow Jackets and a hard-fought 13–12 {{victory over the}} twelfth-ranked Baylor Bears in the Gator Bowl on New Year's Eve. The 1961 team, attempting LSU coach Paul Dietzel's three-platoon system, finished with a 4–5–1 record. The Gators won the Gator Bowl again in 1962, upsetting ninth-ranked Penn State. They wore the Confederate Battle Flag {{on the side of}} their helmets to <b>pump</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> southern team facing a favored northern school. Florida began its 1963 season with a 1–1–1 record. The season highlight followed: a 10–6 upset of the Joe Namath-quarterbacked, third-ranked Crimson Tide in Tuscaloosa, one of only two home losses in Denny Stadium during Bear Bryant's twenty-five years at Alabama. Before the game, Florida's defensive coordinator Gene Ellenson challenged his shaky team's manhood and they rose to the occasion. The Gators won their last three games—against Georgia (21–14), Miami (27–21) and FSU (7–0)—to finish with a 6–3–1 record.|$|E

500|$|The {{director}} intended Doomsday as {{a tribute}} to post-apocalyptic films from the 1970s and 1980s, explaining, [...] "Right from the start, I wanted my film to be an homage to these sorts of movies, and deliberately so. I wanted to make a movie {{for a new generation of}} audience that hadn't seen those movies in the cinema—hadn't seen them at all maybe—and to give them the same thrill that I got from watching them. But kind of contemporise it, <b>pump</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> action and the blood and guts." [...] Cinematic influences on Doomsday include: ...|$|E

2500|$|At seventeen, {{inspired}} by punk zines and [...] "too many" [...] viewings of <b>Pump</b> <b>Up</b> <b>the</b> Volume, Brown started Punch, an underground student newspaper that raised a commotion by running a piece evaluating the school's teachers {{based on a}} survey of hundred students Brown interviewed. He ended up getting disciplined by the school's principal while the entire episode raised enough controversy to be featured on Metro Morning, a CBLA-FM radio programme then-hosted by Andy Barrie, where young Brown got invited to give {{his side of the}} story. Based on the publicity it received via the controversy, the paper expanded to become a Toronto-wide underground project that ran for a few years.|$|E

[...] "Heretic" [...] was originally recorded for the 1986 Deep Six compilation. However, the song was re-recorded during the Louder Than Love recording sessions and this version is featured on the [...] "Hands All Over" [...] single, the <b>Pump</b> <b>Up</b> <b>the</b> Volume soundtrack, and the Loudest Love EP.

2500|$|The use of {{the album}} track [...] "Everybody Knows" [...] from I'm Your Man and [...] "If It Be Your Will" [...] in the 1990 film <b>Pump</b> <b>Up</b> <b>the</b> Volume helped expose Cohen's music to a younger audience. He first {{introduced}} the song during his world tour in 1988. The song [...] "Everybody Knows" [...] also featured prominently in fellow Canadian Atom Egoyan's 1994 film, Exotica. In 1992, Cohen released The Future, which urges (often in terms of biblical prophecy) perseverance, reformation, and hope {{in the face of}} grim prospects. Three tracks from the album – [...] "Waiting for the Miracle", [...] "The Future" [...] and [...] "Anthem" [...] – were featured in the movie Natural Born Killers, which also promoted Cohen's work to a new generation of US listeners.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the live}} tapings, and {{prior to the}} show, there was an {{audience}} warm-up, during which the audience watched a montage of highlights from the show, and staff writer Brian McCann greeted the audience (this task was formerly undertaken by head writer Mike Sweeney). McCann delivered a few jokes, told the audience what to expect, and finally introduced the band and then O'Brien. O'Brien then thanked the audience for coming, meeting as many audience members as he could. He would often then do a musical number with the band to <b>pump</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> audience (Burning Love was one standard). [...] After the show was finished taping, O'Brien sang the [...] "End of the Show Song", which never aired on Late Night, although in February 2009, a short video of it was posted on Late Night Underground.|$|E

2500|$|A second key musical {{element in}} hip hop music is emceeing (also called MCing or rapping). Emceeing is the rhythmic spoken {{delivery}} of rhymes and wordplay, delivered at first without accompaniment and later done over a beat. This spoken style {{was influenced by}} the African American style of [...] "capping", a performance where men tried to outdo each other in originality of their language and tried to gain the favor of the listeners. The basic elements of hip hop—boasting raps, rival [...] "posses" [...] (groups), uptown [...] "throw-downs", and political and social commentary—were all long present in African American music. MCing and rapping performers moved {{back and forth between the}} predominance of [...] "toasting'" [...] songs packed with a mix of boasting, 'slackness' and sexual innuendo and a more topical, political, socially conscious style. The role of the MC originally was as a Master of Ceremonies for a DJ dance event. The MC would introduce the DJ and try to <b>pump</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> audience. The MC spoke between the DJ's songs, urging everyone to get up and dance. MCs would also tell jokes and use their energetic language and enthusiasm to rev up the crowd. Eventually, this introducing role developed into longer sessions of spoken, rhythmic wordplay, and rhyming, which became rapping.|$|E

5000|$|By {{preventing}} the inertia of interrupted venous flow {{that would otherwise}} occur at each ventricular systole, atria allow approximately 75% more cardiac output than would otherwise occur. The fact that atrial contraction is 15% {{of the amount of}} the succeeding ventricular ejection has led to a misplaced emphasis on their role in <b>pumping</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> ventricles (the so-called [...] "atrial kick"), whereas the key benefit of atria is in preventing circulatory inertia and allowing uninterrupted venous flow to the heart.|$|R
60|$|Half an {{hour after}} Claire had innocently passed his ambush, he began to follow her. But not for days was he careless. If he saw her on the horizon he paused until {{she was out of}} sight. That he might not fail her in need, he bought a ridiculously {{expensive}} pair of field glasses, and watched her when she stopped by the road. Once, when both her right rear tire and the spare were punctured before she could make a town, Milt from afar saw her patch a tube, <b>pump</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> tire in the dust. He ached to go to her aid--though it cannot be said that hand-pumping was his favorite July afternoon sport.|$|E
