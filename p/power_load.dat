5|$|The {{existing}} electrical grid, {{and local}} transformers in particular, {{may not have}} enough capacity to handle the additional <b>power</b> <b>load</b> that might be required in certain areas with high plug-in electric car concentrations. As recharging a single electric-drive car could consume {{three times as much}} electricity as a typical home, overloading problems may arise when several vehicles in the same neighborhood recharge at the same time, or during the normal summer peak loads. To avoid such problems, utility executives recommend owners to charge their vehicles overnight when the grid load is lower or to use smarter electric meters that help control demand. When market penetration of plug-in electric vehicles begins to reach significant levels, utilities will have to invest in improvements for local electrical grids in order to handle the additional loads related to recharging to avoid blackouts due to grid overload. Also, some experts have suggested that by implementing variable time-of-day rates, utilities can provide an incentive for plug-in owners to recharge mostly overnight, when rates are lower.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Orthogonal {{frequency}} division multiplexing (OFDM) {{is a practical}} broadband signaling technique for use in multipath fading channels. Over the past ten years, {{research has shown that}} <b>power</b> <b>loading,</b> where the <b>power</b> allocations on the OFDM frequency tones are jointly optimized, can improve error rate or capacity performance. The implementation of <b>power</b> <b>loading,</b> however, is dependent on the presence of complete forward link channel knowledge at the transmitter. In systems using {{frequency division}} duplexing (FDD), this assumption is unrealistic. In this paper, we propose <b>power</b> <b>loading</b> for OFDM symbols using a limited number of feedback bits sent from the receiver to the transmitter. The <b>power</b> <b>loading</b> vector is designed at the receiver, which is assumed to have perfect knowledge of the forward link channel, and conveyed back to the transmitter over a limited rate feedback channel. To allow for the vector to be represented by a small number of bits, the <b>power</b> <b>loading</b> vector is restricted to lie in a finite set, or codebook, of <b>power</b> <b>loading</b> vectors. This codebook is designed offline and known apriorito both the transmitter and receiver.

30|$|Considering the PAR {{reduction}} performance, {{it turns}} out that the ccdf of the original signal is not equal to the reference (5) when considering Gaussian signaling. The reason for this behavior is as follows: in the above definition of the feedforward and feedback matrices <b>power</b> <b>loading</b> over the users is included implicitly within each subcarrier. Considering the time-domain signal, i.e., after applying the IDFT, the antenna signals are no longer pairwise statistically independent. Hence, the distribution of PAR values will not exactly match the analytic result from (5) but higher PAR values will occur. Noteworthy, it is possible to overcome this issue by avoiding <b>power</b> <b>loading</b> over the users. In this case, there remains an individual scaling of each user, which can be equalized within the receiver's automatic gain control. However, in this article, we consider sTHP only with <b>power</b> <b>loading</b> over the users in order to have a fair comparison towards LRA-THP, where it is not straightforwardly possible to avoid <b>power</b> <b>loading.</b>|$|R
