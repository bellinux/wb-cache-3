25|$|The {{first modern}} scholar {{to advance the}} claim that the witch trials had been {{designed}} to wipe out an anti-Christian sect was the German Karl Ernst Jarcke, a professor of criminal law at the University of Berlin. In 1828 he edited the records of a seventeenth-century German witch trial for publication in a legal journal, and included the theory in his own comments. Jarcke suggested that witchcraft had been a pre-Christian religion that survived Christianisation among the rural population, but that after being condemned as Satanism by the Church, it eventually degenerated into genuine Devil-worship and malevolence. At that point, the wider population came to reject it, resulting in the trials. This theory exonerated the Christian Church of blame by asserting that they had been acting on the wishes of the population, {{while at the same time}} not accepting the literal intervention of the Devil in human affairs which liberal rationalists disbelieved. In 1832, Felix Mendelssohn adopted similar ideas when composing his orchestral <b>piece,</b> <b>Die</b> Erste Walpurgisnacht, in which a group of pagan villagers pretend to be witches in order to scare away Christians intent on disrupting their Walpurgis Night festivities.|$|E

Abandoned works include a pastoral opera based on Goethe's Die Laune des Verliebten (The Infatuated Lover's Caprice), written {{at the age}} of 17, Die Hochzeit (The Wedding), on which Wagner worked in 1832, and the singspiel Männerlist größer als Frauenlist (Men are More Cunning than Women, 1837–38). Die Feen (The Fairies, 1833) was unperformed in the composer's lifetime and Das Liebesverbot (The Ban on Love, 1836) was withdrawn after its first performance. Rienzi (1842) was Wagner's first opera to be successfully staged. The compositional style of these early works was conventional—the relatively more sophisticated Rienzi showing the clear influence of Grand Opera à la Spontini and Meyerbeer—and did not exhibit the innovations that would mark Wagner's place in musical history. Later in life, Wagner said that he did not consider these works to be part of his none of them has ever been performed at the Bayreuth Festival, and they have been performed only rarely in the last hundred years (although the overture to Rienzi is an occasional concert <b>piece).</b> <b>Die</b> Feen, Das Liebesverbot and Rienzi were performed at both Leipzig and Bayreuth in 2013 to mark the composer's bicentenary.|$|E

50|$|Rankl {{was born}} in Gaaden, near Vienna, the fourteenth child of a peasant couple. He was educated in Vienna, and from 1918 studied {{composition}} there with Arnold Schoenberg and later with Anton Webern. Many years later, Rankl was invited by the composer to complete Schoenberg's choral <b>piece</b> <b>Die</b> Jakobsleiter but he declined the invitation. Rankl's first professional post was as chorus master and répétiteur under Felix Weingartner at the Volksoper in Vienna in 1919, where he later became an assistant conductor. In 1923 he married Adele Jahoda (1903-1963). Over {{the next few years}} he held appointments in Liberec in 1925, Königsberg in 1927 and the Kroll Oper in Berlin where he was assistant to Otto Klemperer from 1928 to 1931. At the Kroll, Rankl strongly supported Klemperer's policy of promoting new music and radical productions. He was appointed principal conductor of the opera at Wiesbaden in 1931, but when the Nazis came to power in 1933, he had to leave Germany; his wife was Jewish, and Rankl's politics were strongly hostile to the Nazis. He moved back to Austria to head the opera at Graz in 1933, and in 1937 he was appointed principal conductor of the Neues Deutsches Theater in Prague. In 1939, once again displaced by the Nazis, Rankl fled Prague, {{and with the help of}} Sir Adrian Boult, head of music at the BBC, and Boult's assistant Kenneth Wright, he escaped to London.|$|E

40|$|Includes {{recorded}} audio {{files in}} WAV and MP 3 formats, 45 : 45 and 15 : 18 minutes in length. The vocal literature for. this recital encompasses four languages and several styles ranging from early classical to contemporary. The vocal compositions were chosen {{in order to}} convey technical ability, emotional expression and the musical styles of the composers represented. The recital begins with two arias from a lesser known Mozart opera, domeneo, Re de Creta (K. 366). This opera, written in 1780 in Munich for Karl Theodor, The Elector of Munich, has recently begun to be revived and is finding {{a place in the}} standard operatic repertory. The libretto was written by the Salzburg Court Chaplain, Varesco, and was based on a French opera written in 1712 by Danchet and composed by campra. Mozart and Varesco transformed the old five-act tragedy into an Italian opera seria but with choruses in the French manner. Idomeneo is one of Mozart???s grandest and most ambitious works and asks for great virtuosity and dramatic intensity. The two arias performed are written in the standard ABA form and require a knowledge of Mozartian Style and a command of legato line. The classic style of the German lied is represented by four songs of Franz Schubert. The first, Gretchen Spinnrade is the most well known of the four. It is a setting of the spinning scene from Goethe's Faust. The restless movement of the piano represents the spinning wheel and the inner agitation of Gretchen. It is a highly intense and dramatic <b>piece.</b> <b>Die</b> Wachtelschlag is a charming strophic song written in a lighthearted folk song fashion. The third song, Der Blinde Knabe, is again a strophic melody, describing the inner joys and anguishes of a poor blind boy. Auflosung dramatically closes the group showing the romantic declamatory style of Schubert???s later lied. The first half of the recital concludes with a recitative and aria from Verdi???s La Traviata. Written in 1853, La Traviata is usually grouped stylistically with Rigoletto and Il Trovatore to comprise what is thought of as Verdi???s middle period. The libretto, written by Francesco Piave, is based on Alexandre Dumas???, La Dame aux cam??lias. The numbers in the opera are composed in the conventional operatic form the formal aria, duet and chorus, but are transformed by Verdi into meaningful dramatic pieces. The Ah, fos????? lui shows the considerable melodic inventiveness of Verdi. The following Cabaletta is not only a brilliant coloratura showpiece but is a dramatic reflection of Violetta's state of mind. The fioritura of the aria perfectly expresses the hysterical gaiety of Violetta at this point and gives the performer a great challenge, both vocally and dramatically. (See more in text...|$|E
