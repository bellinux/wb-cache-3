5000|$|Williams v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co., 350 F2d 445 (DC 1965) <b>procedural</b> <b>unconscionability</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|Unconscionability is {{a defense}} to the {{enforcement}} of a contract. Most jurisdictions in the United States determine unconscionability based on two prongs: <b>procedural</b> <b>unconscionability</b> and substantive unconscionability. <b>Procedural</b> <b>unconscionability</b> arises from [...] "contract formation" [...] issues such as inconspicuous terms or terms offered on a [...] "take-it-or-leave-it basis", while substantive unconscionability arises from [...] "overly-harsh" [...] or [...] "one-sided" [...] terms.|$|E
50|$|<b>Procedural</b> <b>unconscionability</b> {{is seen as}} the {{disadvantage}} suffered by a weaker party in negotiations, whereas substantive unconscionability refers to the unfairness of terms or outcomes. Most often the former will lead to the latter, but not always. The existence of the <b>procedural</b> <b>unconscionability</b> without substantive unconscionability may be sufficient to set aside a contract, but the latter, by itself, may not. As with issues of consideration, the court's role is not to determine whether someone has made a good or bad bargain, but merely whether that party had the opportunity to properly judge what was best in their own interests.|$|E
5000|$|To avoid {{a ruling}} of <b>procedural</b> <b>unconscionability,</b> some {{businesses}} began allowing consumers to reject ("opt out" [...] of) arbitration agreements {{at the time}} of entering into a contract without penalty. F. Paul Bland and Claire Prestel wrote that more consumers will fail to exercise an opt-out option (which may be inconspicuously placed in a contract and difficult to understand) than would affirmatively agree to arbitrate, citing consumer optimism that disputes will not arise and transaction costs. They added that having an opt-out option would only affect <b>procedural</b> <b>unconscionability</b> and would not apply to other defenses, nor would it prevent a ruling of unconscionability in jurisdictions where substantive unconscionability alone can make a contract term unenforceable. Deepak Gupta, who argued on behalf of the consumer respondents in Concepcion, said that those opt-out provisions are illusory since consumers would not likely opt out before a dispute arises. Plaintiffs and lawyers attributed the lack of opt-outs to consumers not being aware of the existence of the arbitration clause or not understanding the ramifications of not opting out. [...] Charles Gibbs wrote that consumers who opt out would only be able to join in a class action with other consumers who also opted out, and therefore such a class action would have less of a deterrent effect against the business.|$|E
40|$|In {{this annual}} survey, {{we discuss the}} {{electronic}} contracting cases decided between July 1, 2006 and June 30, 2007. In the article, we discuss issues involving contract formation, <b>procedural</b> <b>unconscionability,</b> the scope of UETA and E-SIGN, and contracts formed by automated agents. We conclude that whatever doctrinal doubt judges and scholars may once have had about applying standard contract law to electronic transactions, those doubts have now been largely resolved, and that the decisions involving electronic contracts are following the general law of contracts pretty closely...|$|E
40|$|Mandatory {{arbitration}} agreements subvert {{an employee}} 2 ̆ 7 s {{constitutional right to}} a judicial forum and generally place unfair burdens on plaintiffs. An employee faced with the option of either signing a mandatory arbitration agreement or losing a job often has no meaningful choice. The Supreme Court, however, has failed to recognize first that Congress did not intend for mandatory arbitration to extend to Title VII claims and second, that employers often leave employees with no meaningful choice regarding mandatory arbitration. Nonetheless, state and federal judges are increasingly recognizing that arbitration agreements may be the product of <b>procedural</b> <b>unconscionability.</b> Accordingly, when employees are forced to sign mandatory arbitration agreements and express reservations about being forced to do so, courts examine the doctrine of <b>procedural</b> <b>unconscionability</b> to determine whether such agreements are enforceable. Part II of the article provides some background on the problems employees face with respect to mandatory arbitration agreements. Part III introduces relevant federal statutes, the Federal Arbitration Act, and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Part IV looks {{at the intersection of}} arbitration and employee Title VII claims in federal courts, paying particular attention to the Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Part V examines these courts 2 ̆ 7 repeated misinterpretations of congressional intent and the legislative attempts to remedy the problem, and argues that employee plaintiffs should scrutinize recent state court decisions that have found arbitration agreements substantively and procedurally unconscionable for potential assistance in defending against the enforcement of arbitration clauses. Part VI concludes with the recommendations that courts should reexamine Congress 2 ̆ 7 intent with respect to mandatory arbitration clauses and scrutinize the enforcement of such clauses under the state law doctrine of unconscionability...|$|E
40|$|When an {{individual}} signs {{a contract for}} voluntary repatriation through a private or public body, {{there may be a}} need to draw upon principles of contract law and to test contracts for unconscionability. In the case of asylum seekers and refugees, there may be <b>procedural</b> <b>unconscionability</b> when consent is only the result of fear of deportation or imprisonment, and substantive unconscionability when conditions after return include no access to basic necessities or persecution. At the same time, many asylum seekers and refugees do wish to return, despite conditions in the country of origin or because of conditions in the host country. Ethical issues regarding consent are therefore central. Yet, it is unclear how one would ensure consent under such conditions. While {{it may be possible to}} apply principles of paternalism and hypothetical consent in such cases, this may undermine the rights of those who wish to repatriate, and remove an option they otherwise would not have. This article argues that Parfit's Principle of Consent (CP) and Rights Principle (RP) may address these concerns and applies these principles to test for the unconscionability of two policies of repatriation of refugees and failed asylum seekers in Israel back to countries in Africa between 2009 and 2013. One policy was implemented by an NGO that repatriated failed asylum seekers to countries deemed safe, although returnees had no legal status to stay in Israel and were therefore at risk of deportation. A second NGO returned individuals to South Sudan, even though this was considered dangerous, but only returned South Sudanese who had the legal status to stay in Israel, as this was considered criteria for true voluntariness in the decision to return. By attempting to apply CP and RP in a test for unconscionability, this article addresses both the ethical dilemmas of repatriation of failed asylum seekers and refugees, as well as possible ways in which contracts, more generally, can be tested for unconscionability...|$|E
40|$|In the economy, {{contract}} {{formation and}} recontracting are costly, and these costs {{have important implications}} for contractual outcomes and economic objectives like efficiency. In this dissertation, I characterize systematically how reading costs and renegotiation costs affect contracting behavior, and I describe how third- party enforcement, conducted by institutions such as courts, might ameliorate efficiency problems associated with both types of costly contracting. Chapter I contains analysis of contracting and costly renegotiation using mechanism-design. The Renegotiation-Proofness Principle (RPP) is formalized: any state-contingent payoff vector that is implementable with renegotiation is also implemented by a mechanism in which renegotiation does not occur in equilibrium. The RPP is not valid. However, our more general monotonicity result confirms the RPP's "renegotiation is bad" message, because it shows the set of implementable state-contingent payoffs becomes larger as the costs of renegotiation increase. In the model of Chapter II, a buyer must incur a reading cost to understand payoffs sellers' contracts promise. An equilibrium with reading with reading exists in which the buyer reads offers with positive probability. Further monotonicity results characterize how the equilibrium depends two enforcement features. Increasing the lowest enforceable payoff reduces the equilibrium reading investment and encourages acceptance. And, reducing reading costs increases the buyer's reading probability, though the total reading investment is kept low. I indicate several existing institutional rules that limit contract payoffs or reduce reading costs. The penalty doctrine restricts private damages not to exceed harm; substantive unconscionability effectively excuses performance for a low payoff; and <b>procedural</b> <b>unconscionability</b> and disclosure regulations reduce reading costs. In Chapter III, interaction between a seller who offers a standard form contract and a buyer who reads it [...] under two-sided asymmetric information [...] reveals reading costs are not incurred in equilibrium. Payoff- based limitations on enforceable contracts therefore {{play a vital role in}} agreement, since any accepted contract will not have been read. An example and general discussion relate expected surplus generated in a no-reading equilibrium to contract payoff boundaries defined by enforcemen...|$|E
