The analysis illustrates the affordances provided by the assessment form to handle perspective shifts, when the <b>patient</b> <b>departs</b> from a general pattern of unelaborated answers and offers a window into his/her concerns. Importantly, however, the students' feedback talk with the nurse preceptor offers evidence that the artifact also constrains their forms of action in the practice of gathering assessment data.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The public faces {{a choice}} between two alternatives: {{the status quo and}} a “comprehensive reform ” {{proposal}} that <b>departs</b> from the <b>status</b> quo in several dimensions. Deliberation over the problem {{takes the form of a}} public multi-issue debate. The “reformists” argue that the proposed reform satisfies desirable features lacked by the status quo. The status quo supporters counter-argue that some of these features are obtainable by a reform that <b>departs</b> from the <b>status</b> quo in a single dimension only. This “modest reform ” is not a feasible alternative in the debate and is used by the status quo camp merely as an argument. This type of argument is familiar from real-life debates and usually viewed as a (possibly decisive) pro-status-quo argument. Two questions arise: First, how could an argument that is based on an “irrelevant alternative ” such as the modest reform be considered relevant to the debate? And second, how could this argument be construed as favoring the status quo (perhaps even decisively so) ? I analyze these questions using a model of multi-issue debates, in which alternatives are represented by a repertory of pro and con arguments. The main results are: (1) Con arguments are more effective than pro arguments in determining the debate’s resolution; (2) A status quo bias: certain con arguments against both the status quo and the “comprehensive reform ” nevertheless decide in favor of the status quo...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: To {{analyze the}} {{correlation}} between the many different emergency department (ED) treatment metric intervals and determine if the metrics directly impacted by the physician correlate to the “door to room” interval in an ED (interval determined by ED bed availability). Our null hypothesis was that the cause of the variation in delay to receiving a room was multifactorial and does not correlate to any one metric interval. Methods: We collected daily interval averages from the ED information system, Meditech©. Patient flow metrics were collected on a 24 -hour basis. We analyzed the relationship between the time intervals that make up an ED visit and the “arrival to room” interval using simple correlation (Pearson Correlation coefficients). Summary statistics of industry standard metrics were also done by dividing the intervals into 2 groups, based on the average ED length of stay (LOS) from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey: 2008 Emergency Department Summary. Results: Simple correlation analysis showed that the doctor-to-discharge time interval had no correlation to the interval of “door to room (waiting room time) ”, correlation coefficient (CC) (CC= 0. 000, p= 0. 96). “Room to doctor” had a low correlation to “door to room” CC= 0. 143, while “decision to admitted <b>patients</b> <b>departing</b> the ED time” had a moderate correlation of 0. 29 (p < 0. 001). “New arrivals” (daily patient census) had a strong correlation to longer “door to room” times, 0. 657, p< 0. 001. The “door to discharge” times had a very strong correlation CC= 0. 804 (p< 0. 001), to the extended “door to room” time. Conclusion: Physician-dependent intervals had minimal correlation to the variation in arrival to room time. The “door to room” interval was a significant component to the variation in “door to discharge” i. e. LOS. The hospital-influenced “admit decision to hospital bed” i. e. hospital inpatient capacity, interval had a correlation to delayed “door to room” time. The other major factor affecting department bed availability was the “total patients per day. ” The correlation to the increasing “door to room” time also reflects the effect of availability of ED resources (beds) on the patient evaluation time. The time that it took for a patient to receive a room appeared more dependent on the system resources, for example, beds in the ED, {{as well as in the}} hospital, than on the physician.

40|$|Background: Neck pain is {{associated}} with several alterations in neck motion and motor control. Previous studies have investigated single constructs of neck motor control, while few have applied a comprehensive set of tests to investigate cervical motor control. This comparative cross- sectional study aimed to investigate different motor control constructs in neck pain patients and healthy controls. Methods: A total of 166 subjects participated in the study, 91 healthy controls (HC) and 75 neck pain patients (NP) with long-lasting moderate to severe neck pain. Neck flexibility, proprioception, head steadiness, trajectory movement control, and postural sway were assessed using a 3 D motion tracking system (Liberty). The different constructs of neck motion and motor control were based on tests used in previous studies. Results: Neck flexibility was lower in NP compared to HC, indicated by reduced cervical ROM and conjunct motion. Movement velocity was slower in NP compared to HC. Tests of head steadiness showed a stiffer movement pattern in NP compared to HC, indicated by lower head angular velocity. NP <b>patients</b> <b>departed</b> less from a predictable trajectory movement pattern (figure of eight) compared to healthy controls, {{but there was no}} difference for unpredictable movement patterns (the Fly test). No differences were found for postural sway in standing with eyes open and eyes closed. However, NP patients had significantly larger postural sway when standing on a balance pad. Proprioception did not differ between the groups. Largest effect sizes (ES) were found for neck flexibility (ES range: 0. 2 - 0. 8) and head steadiness (ES range: 1. 3 - 2. 0). Neck flexibility was the only construct that showed a significant association with current neck pain, while peak velocity was the only variable that showed a significant association with kinesiophobia. Conclusions: NP patients showed an overall stiffer and more rigid neck motor control pattern compared to HC, indicated by lower neck flexibility, slower movement velocity, increased head steadiness and more rigid trajectory head motion patterns. Only neck flexibility showed a significant association with clinical features in NP patients. © 2015 Meisingset et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

We report significant relationships between facial fluctuating asymmetry values and age, sex, and genetic ancestry, while socioeconomic status failed to exhibit any strong statistical relationship with facial asymmetry. These results are persistent after the effect of heterozygosity (a proxy for genetic ancestry) is controlled in the model. Our results indicate that, at least on the studied sample, there is no relationship between socioeconomic stress (as intended as low socioeconomic status) and facial asymmetries...|$|R

It reviews approaches from the political sciences and from economics to measure {{the efficacy of}} historical IEAs. It is argued that the current literature is deficient in many respects but that by appropriate extensions an "ideal" method of measurement could be constructed, conceptually. However, due to prohibitive information costs this ideal method is not employed in this article. Instead, we use a simple "theoretical pre-check": We design a basic model which we believe captures the main forces at work in international pollution control. With respect to all possible assumptions underlying this model we choose those which are the most favourable ones regarding the stability and efficacy of an IEA. For these ideal assumptions we derive {{a necessary condition for}} the effectiveness of an IEA. Subsequently, we check a large set of existing IEAs to find that no IEA satisfies this condition.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to identify, {{evaluate}} and compare the determinants of patient satisfaction in fee-for-service, and health maintenance organisation (HMO), medical service delivery centres. Staff at both centres, who were also patients, were surveyed to determine the congruence with patients’ quality improvement priorities. The survey was conducted using a questionnaire consisting of closed questions given to <b>patients</b> as they <b>departed</b> from the medical centres. The questionnaire was tested for convergent and divergent validity, content analysis and reliability. A rating scale was then applied to yield the scores for each determinant. The unique Patient Satisfaction Priority Index was determined using determinants that were rated low on satisfaction but high on importance. The results revealed that patients at the fee- for- service medical centre were significantly more satisfied than patients at the HMO. The priority index for patients were found to be different to that of the staff at both medical centres, proving that staff and patient priorities were incongruent. Accordingly, the recommendations were that patient satisfaction be continuously evaluated at medical service delivery centres, in order to achieve a competitive advantage, sustainability and growth in South Africa’s highly competitive private healthcare industry.

Treatment was initiated including supplemental oxygen, sublingual nitro-glycerin, and aspirin. A 12 -lead prehospital (PH) ECG was acquired at the scene at 6 : 16 AM and interpreted by paramed-ics as showing acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (Figure 1). On {{the basis of the}} PH ECG, paramedics made a single phone call to the closest community hospital emergency department and activated the PH ECG STEMI protocol at 6 : 17 AM. The closest community hospital was located within 5 miles and did not have capability for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The STEMI pro-tocol activation consisted of autolaunching helicopter trans-port to intercept the patient at the community hospital and alerting the cardiac catheterization team at the tertiary PCI center located 50 miles away with the estimated patient arrival time.

40|$|Title from PDF {{of title}} page (University of Missouri [...] Columbia, viewed on November 15, 2013). How do {{political}} institutions shape {{the adoption of}} climate policy? Related to the policies themselves, does their cost structure and {{degree to which they}} <b>depart</b> from the <b>status</b> quo affect adoption? Finally, how effective are these policies at meeting the goals of reducing the emissions of greenhouse gasses (GhGs) ? These questions apply to advanced democracies most responsible for contributing to the changes in climate {{as a result of the}} release of GhGs. As they have contributed the most toward the problem, these states have taken the most policy action on the issue. Studies of climate policy have overlooked many policy actions on the issue and my compilation of a novel dataset is used to examine these policies in a comprehensive manner. Looking at the institutional makeup of a state, I find that when a state has more institutions, they tend to reduce the adoption of major and overall climate policy. Because these institutions reduce the amount of climate policy adoption, they intervene between the policies adopted and outcomes produced. Upon examining the effectiveness of these policies, I confirm my expectations that more major policy adoption and overall climate policy reduces emissions, particularly carbon dioxide. This indicates to policy advocates and lawmakers that efforts to adopt policy addressing climate change produce some positive results. Furthermore, institutions are obstacles to adoption, but could be overcome with deeper institutional penetration in states with more political institutions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a field study of {{strategy}} making in one organization facing an industry crisis. In a comparison of five strategy projects, we observed that organizational participants struggled with competing interpretations of what might emerge in the future, what was currently at stake, and even {{what had happened in}} the past. We develop a model of temporal work in strategy making that articulates how actors resolved differences and linked their interpretations of the past, present, and future so as to construct a strategic account that enabled concrete strategic choice and action. We found that settling on a particular account required it to be coherent, plausible, and acceptable; otherwise, breakdowns resulted. Such breakdowns could impede progress, but they could also be generative in provoking a search for new interpretations and possibilities for action. The more intensely actors engaged in temporal work, the more likely the strategies <b>departed</b> from the <b>status</b> quo. Our model suggests that strategy cannot be understood as the product of more or less accurate forecasting without considering the multiple interpretations of present concerns and historical trajectories that help to constitute those forecasts. Projections of the future are always entangled with views of the past and present, and temporal work is the means by which actors construct and reconstruct the connections among them. These insights into the mechanisms of strategy making help explain the practices and conditions that produce organizational inertia and change. National Science Foundation (U. S.)

Fearful that he may have missed his chance with Susan, Mark attempts to convey his attraction towards her upon her return, though he cannot find the courage to follow through and is left perplexed by Susan's reticence. It transpires that Susan never actually made it to Maui, she instead visited her sister and [...] "little Susie" [...] in Phoenix as she could not overcome her fear of flying. Mark helps her overcome this fear in the following episode ("Fear of Flying"), supporting her during a helicopter flight rotation where they are called upon to treat victims of a serious motor accident.

40|$|Abstract          Background: End {{of life is}} {{difficult}} to establish in patients with dementia and many patients die due to complications related to the disease. To document that care are palliative in this group of patients is not common among nurses and physicians. This may depend on that the palliative course is extended and not similar to the palliative course common among patients with cancer. Aim: To describe how the registered staff in nursing homes document the care of persons with dementia in a late palliative phase. Method: A retrospective record study with a deductive approach. Nursing (n = 50) and medical records (n = 50) for <b>departed</b> <b>patients</b> were reviewed using a review guide based on the Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP). Data were analyzed with a manifest content analysis.  The occurrence of documentation in the records was also counted. Results: Three categories were formulated from the analysis: Initial assessment, Coherent assessment and Follow-up. According to medical records the nurses and physicians knew that patients with dementia were dying, but the position on palliative care was not always decided. Nurses and physicians knew that patients with dementia were dying {{but they did not}} take a stand that the patient needed palliative care.   Mainly physical symptoms were documented and to a lesser degree psychological, social or existential/spirituality needs. Discussion: It was difficult to form a true picture of patients’ situation from out the documentation. Partly because all caring actions were not documented and the review guide was limited as all parts provided to give a holistic care was not represented. That relative had been provided information that the patient was palliative was accurately documented. Conclusion: The holistic care that patients with dementia need in a palliative phase is not elucidated in the documentation in nursing homes in spite of nurses and physicians knowledge of that the patient are dying...|$|R

The Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS) is a prospective, longitudinal, {{observational study}} of hemodialysis patients and facilities in seven countries with large populations of dialysis patients: France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. This paper describes the study design, analytic methods, and preliminary {{findings of the}} DOPPS. The goal {{of the study is}} to determine which practice patterns are associated with the best patient outcomes, with adjustment {{for a wide range of}} patient case-mix characteristics. The primary outcomes of interest are mortality, hospitalization, quality of life, and vascular access events. The facility sample from the seven countries consists of 327 hemodialysis centers in which 24, 392 patients were treated when the study began. A random sample of 10, 332 patients has been selected thus far for more detailed longitudinal data collection. <b>Departing</b> <b>patients</b> are replaced during the study using random selection. A study coordinator at each dialysis facility collects baseline and longitudinal patient data. Patients are asked to complete a questionnaire that addresses quality of life on a yearly basis. The medical director and nurse manager in each facility complete a practice pattern questionnaire. Preliminary data are presented concerning the sample facilities and the census of patients treated in each facility at the start of the study. Dialysis facilities vary widely in size and type (freestanding vs. institutionally-based) across countries. Variation is also seen in patient age, sex distribution, and diabetes mellitus as the attributed cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). At this early phase, the DOPPS has proved to be technically feasible and has revealed basic differences in hemodialysis facilities and patients across the seven participating countries...|$|R
5000|$|As they read, the relatives' {{worst fears}} are soon realised; Buoso has indeed bequeathed his fortune to the monastery. They {{break out in}} woe and indignation and turn to Simone, the oldest present and a former mayor of Fucecchio, but he can offer no help. Rinuccio {{suggests}} that only Gianni Schicchi can advise them what to do, but this is scorned by Zita and the rest, who sneer at Schicchi's humble origins and now say that marriage to the daughter of such a peasant {{is out of the}} question. Rinuccio defends Schicchi in an aria [...] "Avete torto" [...] (You're mistaken), after which Schicchi and Lauretta arrive. Schicchi quickly grasps the situation, and Rinuccio begs him for help, but Schicchi is rudely told by Zita to [...] "be off" [...] and take his daughter with him. Rinuccio and Lauretta listen in despair as Schicchi announces that he will {{have nothing to do with}} such people. Lauretta makes a final plea to him with [...] "O mio babbino caro" [...] (Oh, my dear papa), and he agrees to look at the will. After twice scrutinizing it and concluding that nothing can be done, an idea occurs to him. He sends his daughter outside so that she will be innocent of what is to follow.First, Schicchi establishes that no one other than those present knows that Buoso is dead. He then orders the body removed to another room. A knock announces the arrival of the doctor, Spinelloccio. Schicchi conceals himself behind the bed curtains, mimics Buoso's voice and declares that he's feeling better; he asks the doctor to return that evening. Boasting that he has never lost a <b>patient,</b> Spinelloccio <b>departs.</b> Schicchi then unveils his plan in the aria [...] "Si corre dal notaio" [...] (Run to the notary); having established in the doctor's mind that Buoso is still alive, Schicchi will disguise himself as Buoso and dictate a new will. All are delighted with the scheme, and importune Schicchi with personal requests for Buoso's various possessions, the most treasured of which are [...] "the mule, the house and the mills at Signa". A funeral bell rings, and everyone fears that the news of Buoso's death has emerged, but it turns out that the bell is tolling for the death of a neighbour's Moorish servant. The relatives agree to leave the disposition of the mule, the house and the mills to Schicchi, though each in turn offers him a bribe. The women help him to change into Buoso's clothes as they sing the lyrical trio [...] "Spogliati, bambolino" [...] (Undress, little boy). Before taking his place in the bed, Schicchi warns the company of the grave punishment for those found to have falsified a will: exile from Florence together with the loss of a hand.|$|R
