2500|$|Two {{variants}} {{were initially}} envisioned: a 40-seat, short-range civil transport and a flying crane with a 15,000lb capacity. In March 1956, Westland {{decided to build}} the first prototype as a flying test rig with a tubular steel space frame {{in place of the}} main fuselage; cockpit <b>power-train</b> and undercarriage attached to this. With economy a priority, off-the-shelf components were used as far as possible, with donors such as the Westland Whirlwind helicopter and the Bristol Freighter aeroplane. This prototype was completed in February 1958; after the usual static and systems testing, engine runs and nearly 20 hours of [...] "tied-down" [...] engine testing, the first flight took place on 15 June. Flight testing showed up significant vibration. As a result, a number of changes were made {{in the design of the}} second prototype, including replacement of the main-rotor with the six-blade unit from the Sikorsky S-64. Once the statutory ten hours had been flown, this first Westminster was registered G-APLE and work started on constructing the second prototype.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Strength {{training}} programs for children with cerebral palsy (CP) showed inconclusive evidence for improving walking, despite improvements in strength. Recent {{studies have suggested that}} strength training with high movement velocity is more effective for improving walking than traditional resistance training. OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of functional high-velocity resistance training (<b>power-training)</b> to improve muscle strength and walking capacity of children with CP. METHOD: Twenty-two children with spastic CP participated (13 bilateral, Gross Motor Function Classification System [GMFCS] level I [n = 10] and II [n = 12], 7. 5 years [SD 1. 8, range 4 - 10 years]). Within-subjects changes in a 14 -weeks usual care period were compared with changes in a 14 -week functional <b>power-training</b> period (in groups, 3 ×/wk). Outcome measures were the muscle power sprint test (MPST), 1 -minute walk test (1 MWT), 10 -m shuttle run test (SRT), gross motor function (GMFM- 66), isometric strength of lower-limb muscles and dynamic ankle plantar flexor strength. RESULTS: Changes during the training period were significantly larger than changes in the usual care period for all outcome measures (P <. 05). Large improvements were found during the training period for walking capacity (ΔMPST [mean]: 27. 6 W [95 %CI 15. 84 - 39. 46, 83 % increase], Δ 1 MWT: 9. 4 m [95 % CI 4. 17 - 14. 68, 13 %], ΔSRT: 4. 2 [95 %CI 2. 57 - 5. 83, 56 %], ΔGMFM- 66 : 5. 5 [95 % CI 3. 33 - 7. 74, 7 %]) and muscle strength (18 %- 128 %), while outcomes remained stable in the usual care period. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that functional <b>power-training</b> is an effective training for improving walking capacity in young children with cerebral palsy...|$|R

30|$|The {{automotive}} industry and its supply chain have reacted to this clear need for {{faster and more}} capable interfaces {{and there are several}} new initiatives appearing on the market. FlexRay is a fairly new bus designed to replace the CAN-bus and enable new functionality such as drive-by-wire, high-performance <b>power-trains,</b> safety systems, active suspensions or adaptive cruise control. The Media Oriented Systems Transport (MOST) is primarily designed for consumer multimedia-interconnect such as navigation equipment and in-vehicle entertainment. It claims to be reasonably deterministic from ground up. However, for both these interfaces, the 20  Mbits/s of bandwidth is a non-starter for high speed vision applications. Several companies have pushed for the adoption of IDB- 1394 which is an automotive variant of the highly successful consumer-product: IEEE 1394. However this suffers from most of the same problems of its forerunner.|$|R
5000|$|In 1993, Larry Black {{had come}} up with a novel idea for {{organizing}} and reducing the costs of operating a new car company. Called V.I.M. or virtually integrated manufacturing, this approach was the reverse of Henry Ford's Vertically Integrated Manufacturing, which sought to own and control the entire process of manufacturing, from raw materials to distribution of finished product. Since there was a significant degree of unused manufacturing capacity in the automobile industry, {{it would be possible to}} create a [...] "virtual" [...] car company, where Cunningham Motor Cars would be a design, engineering and marketing firm while other firms with excess capacity would be willing to manufacture and build the major components as subcontractors. It might even be possible to enlist the support of one of America's big three auto manufacturers as the source of <b>power-trains</b> for the project.|$|R

30|$|Uber is {{frequently}} {{referred to as}} cheap, in that users pay less in London per unit distance than for practically {{any other form of}} private hire or taxi service. This helps to explain the company’s extraordinary expansion. But {{there is more than one}} aspect of cost and, as London has detected, the substantial growth in use of Uber may have mixed effects. Where an Uber trip is replacing a private-car trip, the impact may be neutral or positive, depending on a variety of factors, including the <b>power-trains</b> and ages of the two vehicles in question. Where it is replacing a trip by conventional taxi, there may be a marginal benefit given evidence that Uber vehicles are used more intensively than taxis [10]. Where it is replacing a journey by public transport, this implies that the network is being used slightly less efficiently in terms of vehicle footprint and occupancy. If Uber is inducing traffic growth – creating trips – the benefits of the journeys to the individuals making them must be seen alongside the traffic, environmental and safety impacts that this new travel brings. In short, Uber’s overall impact on the transport network and wider environment is complex and probably negative in net terms.|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the optimal training zone for maximum power output. This was to be achieved through estimating mean bar velocity of the concentric phase of a bench press using a prediction equation. The values for the prediction equation would be obtained using OMNI–RES scale values of different loads of the bench press exercise. Sixty males (age 23. 61 2. 1 year body height 16. 2 6. 3 cm body mass 3. 2 4. kg) voluntarily participated in the study and were tested using an incremental protocol on a Smith machine to determine one repetition maximum (1 RM) in the bench press exercise. A linear regression analysis produced a strong correlation (r =- 0. 4) between rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and mean bar velocity (Velmean). The Pearson correlation analysis between real power output (PotReal) and estimated power (PotEst) showed a strong correlation coefficient of r = 0., significant at a level of p = 0. 01. Therefore, the OMNI–RES scale can be used to predict Velmean in the bench press exercise to control the intensity of the exercise. The positive relationship between PotReal and PotEst allowed for the identification of a maximum <b>power-training</b> zone.

40|$|We used {{ultrasonic}} imaging to monitor short-term {{changes in the}} pectoral muscle size of captive red knots Calidris canutus. Pectoral muscle thickness changed rapidly and consistently in parallel with body mass changes caused by flight, fasting and fuelling. Four knots flew repeatedly for 10 h periods in a wind tunnel. Over this period, pectoral muscle thickness decreased in parallel with the decrease in body mass. The change in pectoral muscle thickness during flight was indistinguishable from that during periods of natural and experimental fasting and fuelling. The body-mass-related variation in pectoral muscle thickness between and within individuals {{was not related to}} the amount of flight, indicating that changes in avian muscle do not require <b>power-training</b> as in mammals. Our study suggests that it is possible for birds to consume and replace their flight muscles on a time scale short enough to allow these muscles to be used as part of the energy supply for migratory flight. The adaptive significance of the changes in pectoral muscle mass cannot be explained by reproductive needs since our knots were in the early winter phase of their annual cycle. Instead, pectoral muscle mass changes may reflect (i) the breakdown of protein during heavy exercise and its subsequent restoration, (ii) the regulation of flight capacity to maintain optimal flight performance when body mass varies, or (iii) the need for a particular protein:fat ratio in winter survival stores. ...|$|R

40|$|Background. The {{performance}} of daily tasks, such as stair climbing or lifting an object, requires both muscle strength and power.

The {{purposes of this study}} were to determine whether power training was more efficacious than strength training for improving whole-body physical function in older adults and {{to examine the relationship between}} changes in anaerobic power and muscle strength and changes in physical function. Thirty-nine men and women (mean age 6 SD 5 72. 5 6 6. 3 years) with below-average leg extensor power were randomly assigned to control (C, n 5 15), strength-training (ST, n 5 13) or <b>power-training</b> (PT, n 5 11) groups.

40|$|Power is {{the most}} desired {{physical}} quality {{for a number of}} sports because it entails both force (strength) and velocity (speed) aspects. Power is typically defined as the rate at which work is performed (Mass x Distance / Time). For coaches and sports people it is more often described as strength x speed. Because both strength and speed can be improved by many different training variable manipulations, training to improve power output has been described as requiring a multi-faceted approach (57). However a cursory glance at many resistance training programs or recommendations aimed at increasing muscular power would typically reveal a high proportion of Olympic weightlifting (e. g. power cleans, pulls), plyometric exercises (eg. jumping, bounding) or even rubber tubing exercises (3, 45, 51). While Olympic weightlifting methods of training often produce tremendous increases in lower body power, other methods or exercises, especially for developing upper body power, appear less explored. For example, maximal upper body pressing/pushing power is of importance to football players (rugby league, union, Australian and American football) as well as boxers and martial artists to enhance the ability to push away/strike opponents. However most articles concerning <b>power-training</b> methods involve Olympic weightlifting exercises and lower body plyometrics, paying scant regard to the upper body requirements. However there has been some tremendous research done lately, (especially in Australia or by Australians) that has inspired coaches to be more creative in their power training prescriptions and methods.
