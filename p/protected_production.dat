40|$|Movements in {{wholesale}} prices are compared {{in order to}} examine the effect of differences in the production, marketing and consumption in the Japanese and Australian vegetable industries. The differences include expanding production in Australia but static output in Japan, Japan 2 ̆ 7 s extensive use of <b>protected</b> <b>production,</b> Japan 2 ̆ 7 s designated vegetable system which gives its producers guaranteed prices, increasing vegetable consumption in Australia but declining consumption in Japan, and the use of private treaty negotiated marketing in Australia compared with Japan 2 ̆ 7 s use of auctions. The movement of weekly {{wholesale prices}} of 14 vegetables at Brisbane (Queensland, Australia) and Ohta (Tokyo) in the period May 1989 to April 1990 are compared using (a) movements about their average prices, (b) the number of times price movements change direction, and (c) the extent of between-week movements. The survey of price movements showed that for the 14 vegetables surveyed and on the three criteria developed in the paper Ohta prices moved more frequently and with a greater degree of volatility than those at Brisbane. This suggests that Japan 2 ̆ 7 s extensive use of <b>protected</b> <b>production</b> has not resulted in a greater degree of price stability than Australisa 2 ̆ 7 s open-field production system. Further, without the benefit of a guaranteed price Brisbane has less volatile prices than Japan with its designated vegetable system. Indeed, the very guarantee of stability incorporated with the Japanese system may induce higher degrees of instability. Finally, the imbalance between the number of highest and lowest prices which result from comparing prices stemming from the two systems of price discovery suggests that Ohta 2 ̆ 7 s auction system may not be operating as efficiently as Brisbane 2 ̆ 7 s system of negotiated prices...|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristic}} “high {{input and}} output” in <b>protected</b> <b>production</b> has caused some environmental and ecological issues. Hence, emergy-based sustainability assessments are necessary and valuable. However, traditional emergy analysis is time consuming, tedious, and inefficient. Such disadvantages {{can be addressed}} by the integration of emergy analysis with information technology. This paper reports {{the development of the}} emergy-based sustainability decision assessment system (ESDAS) for protected grape cultivation systems. This system was established by first analyzing the business process, users, and requirements through survey, and the findings of which were used to design the system’s function, architecture, database, model base, and knowledge base with a combination of emergy methods. The results showed that ESDAS passed the system test and achieved the real-time calculation of emergy data and the automatization of emergy analysis. Therefore, this research is a beneficial attempt to apply information technology in improving the efficiency of sustainability assessments. The results also revealed that the protected grape cultivation system is characterized by a heavy dependence on purchased and non-renewable resource emergy, lower emergy yield ratio, higher emergy investment rate and environmental loading ratio, and lower emergy sustainability index. Some suggestions were made to improve the sustainability of the protected grape system...|$|E

40|$|Protected {{vegetable}} {{production area}} {{is greater than}} 26 % of the total vegetable production area in Korea, and portion of <b>protected</b> <b>production</b> area is increasing for flowers and fruits. To secure stable productivity and profitability, continuous and intensive monitoring and control of protected crop production environment is critical, which is labor- and time-consuming. Failure to maintain proper environmental conditions (e. g., light, temperature, humidity) leads to significant damage to crop growth and quality, therefore farmers should visit or be present close to the production area. To overcome these problems, application of remote monitoring and control of crop production environment has been increasing. Wireless monitoring and control systems have used CDMA, internet, and smart phone communications. Levels of technology adoption are different for farmers ’ needs for their cropping systems. In this paper, potential of wireless remote monitoring of protected agricultural environment using CDMA SMS text messages was reported. Monitoring variables were outside weather (precipitation, wind direction and velocity, temperature, and humidity), inside ambient condition (temperature, humidity, CO 2 level, and light intensity), irrigation status (irrigation flow rate and pressure), and soil condition (volumetric water content and matric potential). Scenarios and data formats for environment monitoring were devised, tested, and compared. Results of this study would provide useful information for adoption of wireless remote monitoring techniques by farmers...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the {{discovery}} of gold in California and a federal policy that gave all of the rents in minerals on federal land to private parties led to two important, and closely related, outcomes. The first outcome was {{the development of a}} private-order property rights regime in the gold mining region, key elements of which would later be adopted as federal law. This regime, often considered a canonical example of the emergence of private-order property rights, protected the rights of active users of goldbearing land. 1 As Umbeck (1981) documented, the rights and responsibilities of miners in a particular area were memorialized in a mining district code, which defined who could hold rights, what the rights were, and procedures for transferring rights. These codes and associated norms were successful at controlling violence and so allowed miners to focus the bulk of their energies on mining. Mining district codes also included provisions for the reallocation of rights of inactive users, through claim jumping. In Clay and Wright (2005), we argue that mining claims were not secure property rights as that concept is conventionally understood. This insecurity was in a sense built into the system, in that district codes gave considerable attention to the rights of claim jumpers, individuals who took over a claim deemed to be abandoned. Far from being a violation, ―claim jumping ‖ brought productive land into use and was the most common method of acquiring a claim. 2 Thus, codes both <b>protected</b> <b>production</b> on existing claims and regulated access to mining sites in a competitive race for high-value deposits...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} 15 years, TYLCV {{has been a}} serious problem for tomato {{production}} {{in many parts of}} the world. The virus has been known in Israel for over 40 years and in Florida since 1997 (Cohen & Nitzany, 1966; Polston et al., 1997). In Israel, tomato crops are severely affected by epidemics of TYLCV and despite almost daily spraying with insecticides, 100 % yield losses have often been recorded in cases where the whitefly populations were high (Cohen & Antignus, 1994). In Florida, there have been numerous crop failures due to TYLCV and costs of production have risen. TYLCV is considered the most important pathogen of tomato in Israel and in Florida (Lapidot & Friedmann, 2002). The management of TYLCV in tomato is difficult and expensive both in protected and open field production. Often management techniques are not sufficient and economic losses are incurred. Many approaches have been used to try to decrease losses due to TYLCV although only a few are frequently effective and some cannot be used in all climates and locations. In general, no single approach is effective to manage TYLCV. Combinations of chemical and cultural tech-niques are employed to (1) reduce the number and movement of the whitefly vector, and (2) minimize or eliminate inoculum sources of TYLCV. Management of TYLCV is often expensive and difficult but not always successful. In both Florida and Israel, multiple techniques are employed simul-taneously to reduce incidences of TYLCV-infected plants. In Israel, TYLCV is managed primarily through the use of resistant cultivars, pesticides, cultural practices, and exclusion through the use of 50 mesh screens, and regular or UV absorbing plastics in the case of <b>protected</b> <b>production.</b> In Florida, where th...|$|E

40|$|New Zealand's {{dependence}} on the traditional exports, meat, wool, butter and cheese for the major overseas earners is well documented, (see (1)). New Zealand {{is one of the}} world's most efficient producers of these commodities but market access and short term political and social expediency has tended to reduce the gains of economic rationalization. During the last year (1971) butter and cheese have been placed in long term jeopardy due to Britain's impending union 1 1. This is not an unexpected development. Britain first applied for membership in 1961 and was rejected in 1963 - negotation restarted in 1966 and entry will date from the 1 / 1 / 73. However, the provisions of the Common Agricultural Policy will not come into force until 1 / 1 / 74. with the European Economic Community. Wool suffered a serious price reversal in 1967 and although a price revival has occurred in the past year it is doubtful if this will be a long term recovery. Lamb exports to the U. K. are experiencing greater competition than ever from other meats, especially cheaply produced poultry. The beef quota for the U. S. A. cannot be considered safe as it depends to a large extent on seasonal production variations in the U. S. A. and the strength of the U. S. A. farm lobby. The existence of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, together with low price and income elasticities of demand for primary exports has placed emphasis on manufactured exports and import substitution in New Zealand, but many attempts at such diversification are often misdirected. 2 2. An obvious example of this in New Zealand - The Automobile Industry. (see The World Bank Report on the New Zealand Economy 1968) though the farming industry has some protected sectors also. New Zealand has no absolute or comparative advantage in citrus production, hop production, wheat production - consequently all are protected by trade barriers in common with many other countries.

40|$|Many {{threats that}} plague today’s {{networks}} (e. g., phishing, botnets, {{denial of service}} attacks) are enabled by a complex ecosystem of attack programs commonly called malware. To combat these threats, defenders of these networks have turned to the collection, analysis, and reverse engineering of malware as mechanisms to understand these programs, generate signatures, and facilitate cleanup of infected hosts. Recently however, new malware instances have emerged with the capability to check and often thwart these defensive activities — essentially leaving defenders blind to their activities. To combat this emerging threat, we have undertaken a robust analysis of current malware and developed a detailed taxonomy of malware defender fingerprinting methods. We demonstrate the utility of this taxonomy by using it to characterize the prevalence of these avoidance methods, to generate a novel fingerprinting method that can assist malware propagation, and to create an effective new technique to <b>protect</b> <b>production</b> systems. ...|$|R

40|$|At {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century some of the less {{developed}} countries of Southern Europe often faced major problems when they sought to increase their exports of primary products. Such problems were a consequence of the tariff policies implemented by a number of their trading partners.

The expansion of wine production outside Europe meant that some countries in the American continent raised their tariffs to <b>protect</b> national <b>production,</b> which caused serious damage to exporters. Much more serious was the discriminatory trade policy initiated by France in 1891 which gave priority to the tariff-free importing of Algerian wine, as against the high tariffs that had to be paid by other exporters. This policy, as well as <b>protecting</b> French <b>production,</b> aimed to support her colonial policy in Algeria and seriously affected Spanish exports, as shown by our data and the econometric analysis we have carried out.
