50|$|Memory {{requirements}} {{increase with}} {{the square of}} the dots per inch, so 600 dpi requires a minimum of 4 megabytes for monochrome, and 16 megabytes for color (still at 600 dpi). For fully graphical output using a page description language, a minimum of 1 megabyte of memory is needed to store an entire monochrome letter/A4 sized page of dots at 300 dpi. At 300 dpi, there are 90,000 dots per square inch (300 dots per linear inch). A typical 8.5 × 11 sheet of paper has 0.25 in margins, reducing the <b>printable</b> <b>area</b> to 8.0 x 10.5 in, or 84 square inches. 84 sq/in × 90,000 dots per sq/in = 7,560,000 dots. 1 megabyte = 1,048,576 bytes, or 8,388,608 bits, which is just large enough to hold the entire page at 300 dpi, leaving about 100 kilobytes to spare for use by the raster image processor.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{two types}} of pages in desktop publishing, {{electronic}} pages and virtual paper pages to be printed on physical paper pages. All computerized documents are technically electronic, which are limited in size only by computer memory or computer data storage space. Virtual paper pages will ultimately be printed, and therefore require paper parameters that coincide with international standard physical paper sizes such as [...] "A4, [...] " [...] "letter, [...] " [...] etc., if not custom sizes for trimming. Some desktop publishing programs allow custom sizes designated for large format printing used in posters, billboards and trade show displays. A virtual page for printing has a predesignated size of virtual printing material and can be viewed on a monitor in WYSIWYG format. Each page for printing has trim sizes (edge of paper) and a <b>printable</b> <b>area</b> if bleed printing is not possible {{as is the case with}} most desktop printers. A web page is an example of an electronic page that is not constrained by virtual paper parameters. Most electronic pages may be dynamically re-sized, causing either the content to scale in size with the page or causing the content to re-flow.|$|E
40|$|Microcontact {{printing}} ([mu]CP) is {{an emerging}} technique for patterning micro-scale features for electronics, optics, surface modifications, {{and a variety}} of other applications. Its many advantages over traditional techniques like photolithography include lower cost, ability to pattern on non-planar surfaces, and compatibility with a variety of materials. Low production rates are one of the major limitations, as the process remains primarily a lab-scale technique at this point. Commercialization of the process depends on the development of innovative ways of applying the techniques to fast and flexible process paradigms. This thesis proposes the use of roll-to-roll techniques to increase the throughput, flexibility, and <b>printable</b> <b>area</b> for [mu]CP, while maintaining high quality outputs. A three-part literature review is presented comprising microcontact printing, traditional printing techniques, and roll-to-roll web handling best practices. The development of a printing machine and continuous etching machine used to explore the application of [mu]CP in a high-speed roll-to-roll paradigm is then detailed. Finally, the results of the experimentation carried out are documented including effects on quality and limitations for high throughputs. It is concluded that roll-to-roll microcontact printing can produce high quality results over large areas at rates up to 400 feet per minute and possibly beyond. by Adam Stagnaro. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|Colloidal {{semiconductor}} {{quantum dots}} (QDs) constitute a perfect material for ink-jet <b>printable</b> large <b>area</b> displays, photovoltaics, light-emitting diode, bio-imaging luminescent markers {{and many other}} applications. For this purpose, efficient light emission/absorption and spectral tunability are necessary conditions. These are currently fulfilled by the direct bandgap materials. Si-QDs could offer the solution to major hurdles posed by these materials, namely, toxicity (e. g., Cd-, Pb- or As-based QDs), scarcity (e. g., QD with In, Se, Te) and/or instability. Here we show that by combining quantum confinement with dedicated surface engineering, the biggest drawback of Si—the indirect bandgap nature—can be overcome, and a ‘direct bandgap’ variety of Si-QDs is created. We demonstrate this transformation on chemically synthesized Si-QDs using state-of-the-art optical spectroscopy and theoretical modelling. The carbon surface termination gives rise to drastic modification in electron and hole wavefunctions and radiative transitions between the lowest excited states of electron and hole attain ‘direct bandgap-like’ (phonon-less) character. This results in efficient fast emission, tunable within the visible spectral range by QD size. These findings are fully justified within a tight-binding theoretical model. When the C surface termination is replaced by oxygen, the emission is converted into the well-known red luminescence, with microsecond decay and limited spectral tunability. In that way, the ‘direct bandgap’ Si-QDs convert into the ‘traditional’ indirect bandgap form, thoroughly investigated in the past.

30|$|Printed {{electronics}} {{device is}} fabricated by several printing methods including the screen printing, gravure printing, and ink-jet printing [5 – 8]. First, screen printing was widely used from long ago {{because it had}} simple printing tools which included stencil and squeegee. However, screen printing is not suitable for fragile substrate due to inevitable contact of stencil with substrate and is not inexpensive because it accompanies large amount of ink. Furthermore, this printing method has a lower resolution than other printing methods. In gravure printing, ink was directly transferred through engraved roll. For this reason, it easily applies to roll-to-roll (R 2 R) process. Gravure printing has benefit of higher throughput because this printing method have advantages such as <b>printable</b> large <b>area</b> and fast printing speed by continuous process. However, a developed R 2 R printing equipment {{can be used by}} ink of one-type and printed structure can be damaged by contact of substrate with roll. Ink-jet printing technology creates a flexible electronics without contact of nozzle with substrate, which produces single droplet contained metal nano-particle through nozzle. This printing method offers relatively lower throughput than other printing methods, because ink-jet printer restricts the number of nozzles and directly draws a circuits of electronics device. However, the resolution is relatively higher than other printing methods, and various substrates are broadly utilized in order to use benefits of ink-jet printing technology. In addition, ink-jet printing provides distinguished advantage such as drop-on-demand printing, no wastage of ink, various functional inks, and non-contact printing. For this reason, research on ink-jet printing technology is required. In particular, RF performance of printed structure has to be investigated in regard to type of substrate because flexible device is fabricated on flexible substrate rather than rigid substrate.|$|R
