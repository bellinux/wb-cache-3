40|$|Bioremediation is {{a broadly}} applied {{environmentally}} friendly and economical {{treatment for the}} clean-up of sites contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons. However, the application of this technology to con-taminated soil in Libya has not been fully exploited. Inthisstudy, the efficacy of different bioremediation processes (necrophytoremediation using <b>pea</b> <b>straw,</b> bioaugmentation and acombination of both treat-ments) together with natura lattenuation were assessed in dieselcontaminated Libyan soils. The addition of <b>pea</b> <b>straw</b> {{was found to be}} the best bioremediation treatment for cleaning up diesel contaminated Libyan soil after 12 weeks. The greatest TPH degradation, 96. 1 % (18, 239. 6 mgkg 1) and 95 % (17, 991. 14 mgkg 1) were obtained when the soil was amended with <b>pea</b> <b>straw</b> alone and in combination with a hydrocarbonoclastic consortium respectively. Incontrast, natural attenuation resulted in a sig-nificantly lowerTPH reduction of 76 %(14, 444. 5 mgkg 1). The presence of <b>pea</b> <b>straw</b> also led to asig-nificant increased recovery of hydrocarbon degraders; 5. 7 log CFUg 1 dry soil, compared to 4. 4 log CFU g 1 dry soil for the untreated (naturalattenuation) soil. DGGE and Illumina 16 Smetagenomic analyses confirm shifts in bacterial communities compared with original soil after 12 weeks incubation. In addition, metagenomic analysiss howed that original soil contained hydrocarbon degraders (e. g. Pseudoxanthomonas spp. and Alcanivorax spp.). However, they require abiostimulant (inthiscasepea straw) to be comeactive. This study is the first to report successful oil bioremediation with <b>pea</b> <b>straw</b> in Libya. It demonstrates the effectiveness of <b>pea</b> <b>straw</b> in enhancing bioremediation of the diesel-con-taminated Libyan soil...|$|E
40|$|The black stilt is an {{endangered}} species of wetland bird that now breeds only in the Mackenzie Basin, South Canterbury, New Zealand. One major cause of its decline has been the loss of wetland habitat. Attempts {{in the last decade}} to create wetlands for black stilts have not been successful, partly because artificial ponds had packed stone and silt substrata that provided few macroinvertebrates as black stilt food. We added up to four substrata (<b>pea</b> <b>straw,</b> small stones, large stones and topsoil) to 1 m 2 quadrats in streams and/or ponds at three sites in an attempt to experimentally enhance invertebrate food supplies. Biomass and densities of macroinvertebrates were quantified 10 and 16 weeks after substrate additions. Invertebrate biomass was up to 18 times greater in quadrats to which <b>pea</b> <b>straw</b> had been added than in control quadrats (no substrate added). Biomass of invertebrates in <b>pea</b> <b>straw,</b> small stone and large stone substrata all exceeded a putative nesting threshold for black stilts of 1 g m- 2.

40|$|Lignocellulosic wastes such as straw are {{attractive}} resources for biofuel production when subjected to biological treatment (hydrolysis). However, their complex lignocellulosic structure can hinder saccharification. The {{urgent need for}} microbial groups {{with high levels of}} straw saccharifying activities is therefore a key step in the bioconversion of lignocellulosic straw into fermentable monosaccharides. Existing traditional methods of qualitative and quantitative screening of lignocellulolytic microbial isolates are costly, time consuming and largely not environmentally friendly. In this study, a Biolog (MT 2) microplate-based assay was evaluated for potential use as an alternative screening method. This was carried out using three commercially available substrates (cellulose, xylan and lignin) and four native lignocellulosic straws (wheat, rice, sugarcane, and <b>pea</b> ball-milled <b>straws).</b> Selected bacterial isolates from soil, compost and straws were screened quantitatively using both traditional crude enzyme and Biolog (MT 2) microplate methods. Positive correlations (R 2 values up to 0. 86) between Biolog and the traditional enzyme methodologies were observed with respect to these isolates and their lignocellulosic activities. Quantitative assays were less labor intensive and faster (3 - 7 days) in Biolog microplates than in traditional assays which lasted for 12 - 15 days. Ball-milled rice and sugarcane straws were bio-converted to monosaccharaides more readily than wheat and <b>pea</b> <b>straws</b> and the commercially available substrates (cellulose, xylan and lignin). Environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) analysis of ball-milled rice and sugarcane straws suggested that this was due to their higher silica content. Overall, the Biolog (MT 2) microplate system was shown to be an effective, time saving and inexpensive alternative method for the screening of both lignocellulose-degrading bacteria and different substrates for saccharification...|$|R

Very cheap sources of fibre are available to feed ostriches in Australia. The purpose of these experiments was to examine; i) the role of fibre digesting enzymes in improving the utilization of lucerne silage and ii) to provide information on the role of lucerne silage, lucerne and <b>pea</b> <b>straw</b> in supplementary diets. The first trial compared the growth of ostriches from 32 - 36 weeks-of-age fed a commercial finisher diet (with and without a glycanase enzyme) with a lucerne silage diet (also with or without enzyme supplementation). The birds on the silage diet (with enzyme) had a significantly (P< 0. 05) lower body weight (79. 7 kg) than the birds on the commercial finisher diet (85. 9 kg) after 4 weeks of feeding, but {{there were no significant differences}} between the other diets. The silage wasted by the ostriches was considerable and estimated to be about 60 % of the total offered. In practical situations birds would need to be given a greater opportunity to adapt to the diet and for the silage to be chopped to 5 cm in length to ensure enough feed was consumed to achieve the same growth as the birds on the commercial finisher diet. For grower birds fed a 24 and 40 % <b>pea</b> <b>straw</b> diet and a 20 % lucerne diet from 24 - 30 weeks-of-age, body weight of birds on the commercial grower (57. 7 kg) and lucerne diet (54. 3 kg) were significantly higher (P< 0. 05) than the 24 % <b>pea</b> <b>straw</b> diet (50. 1 kg) and 40 % <b>pea</b> <b>straw</b> diet (48. 9 kg) at 27 weeks. The poor performance of birds on <b>pea</b> <b>straw</b> diets might result from birds consuming twice the fibre intake and 30 % lower energy than those birds on the commercial diet.

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of necrophyto{{remediation}}, using pea and wheat straws on the remediation soil contaminated with two common polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), phenanthrene and pyrene alone or in combination was investigated. In addition, monitoring {{of the population of}} PAH-utilising microorganisms together with PCR-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) -sequencing methods were used to further elucidate {{the effect of}} straw addition on the bacterial, fungal and nidA gene (a functional gene involved in the degradation of PAHs) communities. The addition of <b>pea</b> <b>straw</b> had a positive effect on the degradation of PAHs, especially for pyrene. For example, the addition of <b>pea</b> <b>straw</b> to pyrene-contaminated soil resulted in an increase in the degradation of pyrene from 15 % (66 mg kg- 1) in the corresponding control to 70 % (301 mg kg- 1). The results from the most probable number (MPN) of PAH-utilising microorganisms and PCR-DGGE-sequencing methods indicated that the addition of straw led to an increase in microbial hydrocarbonoclastic biomass rather than changes in microbial diversity. For example, in pyrene-contaminated soil, the number of PAH-utilising microorganisms in the soil amended with <b>pea</b> <b>straw</b> reached 5. 6 log 10 CFU g- 1 dry soil, ∼ 13 -fold increase when compared with the numbers present in the control soil (4. 5 log 10 CFU g- 1 dry soils); however, the Shannon diversity index did not increase significantly. The sequencing of bands of interest from DGGE profiles revealed the presence of Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria in the bacterial community. For fungi, sequenced bands belonged to Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Mucoromycotina. In summary, this study has shown that necrophytoremediation using <b>pea</b> <b>straw</b> represents a promising biostimulation and cost effective agent which can be used for the bioremediation of PAH-contaminated soils...|$|E

40|$|Petrogenic {{hydrocarbons}} represent ubiquitous pollutants which threaten {{both human}} and environmental health. In recent years, there has been increasing interest {{in the use of}} sustainable, cost effective technologies to remediate these petrogenic hydrocarbons in the environment. This PhD research was designed to enhance and develop these clean technologies using phytoremediation (plant-assisted bioremediation) and necrophytoremediation (plant dead biomass-assisted bioremediation) methods. Traditional microbiological methods were used in conjunction with the molecular ecological methods throughout this research to better understand the response of the natural microbial community to phytoremediation and necrophytoremediation. In {{the first part of this}} study a variety of plants including alfalfa, arrowleaf clover, balansa clover, berseem clover, French serradella, maize, pea, Persian clover, wallaby grass, wheat and wheat grass were screened for their ability to grow in a soil contaminated with 1 % w/w (10, 000 mg kg− 1) aliphatic hydrocarbons (60 % diesel/ 40 % engine oil) or 1 % w/w crude sludge. Based on emergence, shoot and root length and root shoot weight ratio, maize and wheat were selected as both showed the greatest performance. A further 90 day greenhouse study was carried out to evaluate the microbial aspect of rhizodegradation, using a contaminated soil containing a diesel/engine oil mix (1 % w/w). The results showed that the presence of maize and wheat plants increased the degradation of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), with soil containing maize and wheat showing a significant TPH reduction of 72 % (5, 880 mg kg− 1) and 66 % (5, 390 mg kg− 1) respectively, compared with a reduction of 57 % (4, 633 mg kg− 1) in contaminated soil only. Microbial community analyses using DNA-PCR-DGGE for both bacterial and fungal communities confirmed that the presence of the plants influenced the structure of the soil microbial community. In addition to changes in microbial community, quantification of alkB genes (encoding alkane monooxygenase; a key enzyme in the degradation of aliphatic hydrocarbon) using MPN-qPCR demonstrated that the planting of maize and wheat on contaminated soil led to a 20 and 16 -fold increase in alkB gene copy numbers respectively, relative to the control soil. In the second part of this study, necrophytoremediation (using alfalfa hay, <b>pea</b> <b>straw,</b> wheat straw and various residues including 20 % hay, 37. 5 % <b>pea</b> <b>straw,</b> 37. 5 % wheat straw and 5 % gypsum) was evaluated as a technique for use in the bioremediation of aliphatic hydrocarbons. The presence of plant residues was found to have a significant impact on the utilisation rate of TPH when compared to the control. The highest TPH reduction, up to 83 % (6, 800 mg kg- 1) was observed in soil mixed with <b>pea</b> <b>straw,</b> compared to a TPH utilisation of 57 % (4, 633 mg kg- 1) in the control soil. The abundance of petrogenic hydrocarbon-utilising microorganisms increased in the contaminated soil amended with plant residues. For example, a 12 -fold increase in hydrocarbon utilising microorganisms was observed when <b>pea</b> <b>straw</b> was mixed with contaminated soil. Microbial community analyses using DNA-PCR-DGGE of both bacterial and fungal communities showed that amending the contaminated soil with plant residues led to significant changes in the soil microbial community diversity in the most of the treatments (e. g. <b>pea</b> <b>straw</b> in terms of bacterial community). Sequencing of the bands of interest again showed the presence of some hydrocarbonoclastic microorganisms only in soil amended with plant residues in the bacterial and fungal DGGE-profiles, confirming that the presence of plant residues changed the activity and diversity of hydrocarbon utilising-microorganisms. Interestingly the presence of plant residues (e. g. <b>pea</b> <b>straw)</b> led to the detection of fungus Trichurus spiralis, which exhibits both hydrocarbonoclastic and necrophytic properties. In the third part of this study, the effect of necrophytoremediation using pea and wheat straws (found to promote degradation in the second part of the study) on the remediation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was investigated using soil contaminated with phenanthrene (500 mg kg− 1) and pyrene (500 mg kg− 1), alone or in a combination. The results showed that adding pea or wheat straw to contaminated soil significantly increased PAH reduction in the all treatments except in phenanthrene-contaminated soil amended with wheat straw. The results also showed that the beneficial effects of necrophytoremediation were most evident in pyrene contamination. For example, pyrene-contaminated soil amended with <b>pea</b> <b>straw</b> led to an increase in the degradation of pyrene from 15 % (64 mg kg− 1) in the corresponding control to 70 % (301 mg kg− 1). The results also showed that <b>pea</b> <b>straw</b> generally resulted in greater beneficial effects compared with wheat straw in terms of PAH degradation. Microbiological analysis of the soils using MPN in conjunction with PCR-DGGE-sequencing methods demonstrated that both straws promoted microbial hydrocarbonoclastic biomass rather than changes in microbial diversity. In summary, this study has shown that both phytoremediation and necrophytoremediation can be used in the successful bioremediation of petrogenic hydrocarbons. However, the plant toxicity associated with many hydrocarbon products may limit the use of phytoremediation. In contrast, necrophytoremediation represents an effective toxic-independent remediation protocol. In addition, using plant residues in general and <b>pea</b> <b>straw</b> in particular represents a cost effective, green technology which can be applied as a biostimulator for the remediation of crude oils, diesel oils and PAHs in contaminated soils...|$|E

This thesis reports the repurposing of renewable resources which included wheat straw, biomass ash, waste cardboard (paper) and paper de-inking residues (DIR) to extract, synthesize and produce potentially high value chemicals, materials and composites. Biosilicate solutions were successfully extracted from biomass ash including wheat straw ash and miscanthus ash with aqueous potassium hydroxide solutions. Systematic analyses had been applied on the extraction of biosilicate solutions to obtain different types of silicate solutions for further applications of binder and mesoporous materials. Biosilicate solutions extracted from miscanthus ash were utilized as binders to make bioboards, whilst biosilicate solutions extracted from wheat straw ash were utilized as a silica resource to synthesize biobased mesoporous materials, namely bio-MCM- 41 and bio-SBA- 15. N 2 porosimetry analysis revealed that mesoporous silica made from biosilicate solutions gave a surface area of bio-MCM- 41 of > 1000 m 2 g- 1 and a surface area of > 800 m 2 g- 1 for bio-SBA- 15. XRD, SEM and TEM analyses for both bio-MCM- 41 and bio-SBA- 15 revealed significant ordering pores, structure and the hexagonal arrays. Different kinds of renewable resources including wheat <b>straw,</b> <b>pea</b> pod waste and paper de-inking residue with the binder of biosilicate solutions and other chemical additives such as protein and starch were processed to bioboards.

The effect of salinity on microbial activity and biomass has been studied extensively, but {{little is known about}} the response of microbes from different soils to increasing salinity although soil salinity may fluctuate in the field, for example, depending on the quality of the irrigation water or seasonally. An incubation experiment with five soils (one non-saline, four saline with electrical conductivity (ECe) ranging from 1 to 50 dS m− 1) was conducted in which the EC was increased to 37 ECe levels (from 3 to 119 dS m− 1) by adding NaCl. After amendment with 2 % (w/w) <b>pea</b> <b>straw</b> to provide a nutrient source, the soils were incubated at optimal water content for 15 days, microbial respiration was measured continuously and chloroform-labile C was determined every three days. Both cumulative respiration and microbial biomass (indicated by chloroform-labile C) were negatively correlated with EC. Irrespective of the original soil EC, cumulative respiration at a given adjusted EC was similar. Thus, microorganisms from previously saline soils were not more tolerant to a given adjusted EC than those in originally non-saline soil. Microbial biomass in all soils increased from day 0 to day 3, then decreased. The relative increase was greater in soils which had a lower microbial biomass on day 0 (which were more saline). Therefore the relative increase in microbial biomass appears to be a function of the biomass on day 0 rather than the EC. Hence, the results suggest that microbes from originally saline soils are not more tolerant to increases in salinity than those from originally non-saline soils. The strong increase in microbial biomass upon <b>pea</b> <b>straw</b> addition suggests that there is a subset of microbes in all soils that can respond to increased substrate availability even in highly saline environments.

On the other hand, Ghazalah and El-Shahat (1994) showed that inclusion of olive meal instead of barley increased OM digestibility. Also, Salwa et al. (2000), Falcão-e-Cunha et al.

In the treatments with the same water content in both periods [optimal (O-O) and medium (M-M) ], respiration rates decreased over time and were lower in M-M than in O-O. Cumulative respiration at medium water content did not differ between slow (L-SM) or rapid rewetting (L-RM) from low to medium water content. There were two periods in Experiment 3 with the water content {{in the first period}} 50, 40 or 30 % of WHC adjusted from 60 % during pre-incubation either slowly or rapidly. The water content in the second period was maintained or adjusted slowly to 30 – 60 %. Cumulative respiration differed between water contents but was not consistently different between rapid and slow drying in the first period. We conclude that the response of microbial activity to a certain water content is influenced by the previous water content whereas the speed at which the water content is adjusted had little effect on respiration at target water content.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{salinity}} on microbial activity, biomass, and community structure {{has been studied}} extensively, but {{little is known about}} the effect of decreasing salinity without strong changes in soil water content as they may occur when irrigation water of lower salinity is used. An incubation experiment with three naturally saline soils [electrical conductivity of the saturated paste (ECe) : 12, 32, and 41 dS m− 1] was conducted, in which the EC was decreased to 8 ECe levels (from 6 to 32 dS m− 1) by leaching with solutions of different NaCl concentrations. Finely ground <b>pea</b> <b>straw</b> was added at 20 g[*]kg− 1 as a nutrient source. The soils were incubated at optimal water content for 15 days, during which soil respiration was measured continuously. Microbial biomass C was determined on days 5, 10, and 15. Both cumulative respiration and microbial biomass C were negatively correlated with EC. At a given adjusted EC, irrespective of the original EC, cumulative respiration recovered to the same level as in the soils which had originally this lower EC. This was also the case for microbial biomass C except for the soil that had the highest original EC; there, microbial biomass C did not fully recover. The results suggest that even in very saline soils, activity and growth of a proportion of microbial community can rapidly increase when the EC is reduced and substrate is added. Thus, microbial activity and biomass are mainly a function of the final EC. However, while microbial activity (respiration) had completely recovered after 15 days, recovery of the microbial biomass may take longer when the original EC was high.

40|$|Organic matter {{influences}} aggregation in non-sodic soils, {{but less}} {{is known about}} its role in sodic soils. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the role of organic matter in aggregation and clay dispersion in soils with different levels of sodicity. Prepared soils with 15 % clay (smectitic or illitic) and natural soil aggregates (from a smectitic clay soil [Pellustert] with 25 g kg− 1 organic C and a pair of illitic loams [Rhodoxeralfs] with 15 and 29 g kg− 1 organic C) were equilibrated with solutions having sodium adsorption ratios (SAR) of 0, 5, 15, and 30. Pea (Pisum sativum L.) straw was added at 50 g kg− 1 to the prepared soils, which were then incubated. Changes in aggregation during incubation were similar irrespective of clay type. After 7 d incubation with no added straw at SAR 0 and 30, the amounts of spontaneously dispersible clay were 5. 9 and 23. 7 g kg− 1 soil, and mechanically dispersible clay was 11. 9 and 23. 3 g kg− 1 soil. Macroaggregation (> 250 µm) was 125 and 41 g kg− 1 soil at SAR 0 and 30. After 67 d incubation with <b>pea</b> <b>straw,</b> spontaneously dispersible clay contents were 2. 1 and 5. 4 g kg− 1, mechanically dispersible clay contents were 9. 0 and 17. 7 g kg− 1 soil, and macroaggregation was 533 and 416 g kg− 1 soil at SAR 0 and 30. The effects of sodicity and organic matter on structural stability of the natural soil aggregates were similar to those in the prepared soils, but macroaggregation was less, and the smectitie clay soil was more sensitive to sodicity than the illitic loams. This work showed that organic matter has at least as great a role in aggregation in sodic soils as in non-sodic soils...|$|E
40|$|Low {{soil water}} content (low matric potential) and {{salinity}} (low osmotic potential) occur frequently in soils, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. Although {{the effect of}} low matric or low osmotic potential on soil microorganisms have been studied before, {{this is the first}} report which compares the effect of the two stresses on microbial activity and community structure. A sand and a sandy loam, differing in pore size distribution, nutrient content and microbial biomass and community structure, were used. For the osmotic stress experiment, salt (NaCl) was added to achieve osmotic potentials from - 0. 99 to - 13. 13 MPa (sand) and from - 0. 21 to 3. 41 MPa (sandy loam) after which the soils were pre-incubated at optimal water content for 10 d. For the matric stress experiment, soils were also pre-incubated at optimal water content for 10 d, after which the water content was adjusted to give matric potentials from - 0. 03 and - 1. 68 MPa (sand) and from - 0. 10 to 1. 46 MPa (sandy loam). After amendment with 2 % (w/w) <b>pea</b> <b>straw</b> (C/N 26), soil respiration was measured over 14 d. Osmotic potential decreased with decreasing soil water content, particularly in the sand. Soil respiration decreased with decreasing water potential (osmotic + matric). At a given water potential, respiration decreased to a greater extent in the matric stress experiment than in the osmotic stress experiment. Decreasing osmotic and matric potential reduced microbial biomass (sum of phospholipid fatty acids measured after 14 days) and changed microbial community structure: fungi were less tolerant to decreasing osmotic potential than bacteria, but more tolerant to decreasing water content. It is concluded that low matric potential may be more detrimental than a corresponding low osmotic potential at optimal soil water content. This {{is likely to be a}} consequence of the restricted diffusion of substrates and thus a reduced ability of the microbes to synthesise osmolytes to help maintain cell water content. The study also highlighted that it needs to be considered that decreasing soil water content concentrates the salts, hence microorganisms in dry soils are exposed to two stressors. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|As saline soils dry, {{the salt}} in the {{remaining}} solution phase is concentrated and the microbes are subjected to both water and osmotic stress. However, {{little is known about}} the interactive effect of matric potential (MP) and osmotic potential (OP) on microbial activity and community structure. We conducted an experiment in which two non-saline soils, a sand and a sandy loam, were pre-incubated at optimal water content (for microbial activity) but different osmotic potentials achieved by adding NaCl. The EC of the saturated paste (ECe) ranged between 1. 6 and 11. 6 dS m - 1 in the sand and between 0. 6 and 17. 7 dS m - 1 in the sandy loam. After the 14 -day pre-incubation, the soils were dried to different water contents: 25 - 35 g kg - 1 in the sand and 95 - 200 g kg - 1 in the sandy loam. Water potential (WP, the sum of osmotic + matric potential) ranged from - 0. 7 to - 6. 8 MPa in the sand and from - 0. 1 to - 4. 4 MPa in the sandy loam. After addition of ground <b>pea</b> <b>straw</b> to increase the concentration of readily available substrate, respiration was measured over 14 days and microbial community composition was assessed by phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) at the end of the experiment. In both soils, cumulative respiration at a given soil water content (WC) decreased with decreasing osmotic potential, but the effect of decreasing water content differed between the two soils. In the sand, cumulative respiration at the two lowest water contents (WC 25 and WC 28) was always significantly lower than that at the highest water content (WC 35). In the sandy loam, cumulative respiration was significantly lower at the lowest water content (WC 95) compared to the highest water content (WC 200) only in treatments with added salt. The reduction of cumulative respiration at a given WP was similar in the two soils with a 50 % reduction compared to the control (optimal water content, no salt added) at WP - 3 MPa.

40|$|Field pea is an {{important}} annual crop due to its contribution to soil fertility and other rotational benefits. However, weeds and ascochyta blight limit pea yield, particularly in organic systems. Leafed and semi-leafless pea types differ in lodging resistance, and may affect weeds and disease through differences in canopy light penetration and air flow. Mixtures of the two leaf types may improve weed and disease suppression and yield compared with monocultures of the same cultivars. To test this hypothesis, replicated field experiments were conducted under organic and conventional management in Saskatoon and Vonda, SK, in 2011 and 2012. Mixtures of a leafed and semi-leafless cultivar, CDC Sonata and CDC Dakota, were sown in ratios of 0 : 100, 25 : 75, 50 : 50, 75 : 25, and 100 : 0 leafed to semi-leafless pea, at target seeding rates of 88 and 132 plants m- 2. Conventionally managed plots were inoculated with ascochyta blight-infested <b>pea</b> <b>straw</b> and received overhead irrigation to encourage disease. Mixtures of 50 % or more semi-leafless pea adopted the greater lodging resistance and weed suppression of the semi-leafless cultivar. Mixtures comprised of 25 % leafed and 75 % semi-leafless pea increased both seed and biomass yield compared with either cultivar grown alone. Yield enhancement was attributed to the leafed cultivar, whose seed yield was 76 % higher in mixture than expected based on monoculture yield. Ascochyta blight epidemics were of moderate severity, and leafed and semi-leafless monocultures reached 36 and 43 % necrosis in 2011, and 33 and 38 % necrosis in 2012, respectively. The disease reaction of mixtures fell between the two component cultivars. At disease onset in 2012, lower light interception and shorter moisture durations coincided with the lower ascochyta blight severity of leafed monocultures. In 2011 and the later phase of the 2012 epidemic, disease severity was negatively associated with vine length, and positively associated with number of nodes and tissue senescence. Despite the advantages of leafed and semi-leafless pea mixtures, the limited selection of leafed cultivars impedes adoption of this technique by growers. For pea breeders, developing mixtures of pea lines isogenic for leaf type may increase yield compared with single cultivars. ...|$|E
40|$|Soils are {{frequently}} exposed to drying and wetting events and {{previous studies have}} shown that rewetting results in a strong but short-lived flush of microbial activity. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of the water content during the dry period on the size and duration of the flush and on the rate of recovery. Two soils (a sand and a sandy loam) were maintained at different water contents (WC) 30, 28 and 25 g water kg- 1 soil (sand) and 130, 105 and 95 g water kg- 1 soil (sandy loam) for 14 days, then rewet to the water content at which respiration was optimal [WC 35 (sand), WC 200 (sandy loam) ] and maintained at this level until day 68. Ground <b>pea</b> <b>straw</b> (C/N 26) was added and incorporated on day 1. The controls were maintained at the optimal water content throughout the 68 days. Respiration rates during the dry phase (days 1 - 14) decreased with decreasing water content. The flush of respiration after rewetting peaked on day 15 in the sandy loam and on day 16 in the sand; it was greatest in the soils that had been maintained at the lowest water content [WC 25 (sand) and WC 95 (sandy loam) ]. Cumulative respiration during the remainder of the incubation period in which all soils were maintained at optimal water content increased more strongly in the soils that had been dry compared to the constantly moist control. On the final day of the dry period (day 14), cumulative respiration in the dry soils was 29 - 65 % (sand) and 67 - 94 % (sandy loam) of the constantly moist control whereas on day 68 it was 80 - 84 % (sand) and 86 - 96 % (sandy loam). The greater increase in cumulative respiration in the previously dry soils can be explained by the reduced decomposition rates during the dry period which resulted in higher substrate availability on day 14 compared to the constantly moist control. Microbial community structure assessed by phospholipid fatty acid analyses changed over time in all treatments but was less affected by water content than respiration; it differed only between the highest and the lowest water content. These differences were maintained throughout the incubation period in the sandy loam and transiently in the sand. It can be concluded that the soil water content during the dry phase affects the size of the flush in microbial activity upon rewetting and that microbial activity in previously dried soils may not be fully restored even after 54 days of moist incubation, suggesting that drying of soil can have a significant and long-lasting impact on microbial functioning. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|Acid sulfate soils with sulfuric horizons (sulfuric soils) can exert a {{range of}} {{negative}} impacts on the ecology and productivity of soils. The primary treatment for these soils is to raise the pH using lime. Although often effective, this treatment can be expensive and not well suited to large areas. In this research, the possible use of plant organic matter to ameliorate sulfuric soils or to prevent acid sulfate soils with sulfidic materials (sulfidic soils) from acidifying was investigated. The advantage {{of this approach is}} that organic matter is readily available, inexpensive and environmentally friendly, especially in Ramsar listed wetlands where lime cannot be used. The experimental treatments used ground leaves of Phragmites, lucerne hay, <b>pea</b> <b>straw</b> and wheat straw as sources of organic matter with varying nitrogen, which were either incorporated into or overlaid {{on the surface of the}} soils. After 6 months of incubation under either aerobic or anaerobic soil conditions, pH, Eh and sulfate content were measured. Incorporation of complex organic matter significantly increased the pH of both sulfuric and sulfidic soils. These changes were correlated with reductions in soil redox and sulfate content. The magnitude of the changes depended on the nitrogen content of the complex organic matter. The relative importance of carbon and nitrogen in ameliorating acid sulfate soils was further investigated respectively using glucose, sodium acetate and molasses as simple carbon sources, and urea, nitrate and ammonium as simple nitrogen compounds. It was found that compounds containing inorganic nitrogen alone without carbon were ineffective, while urea significantly increased pH and reduced Eh, but did not affect the sulfate content of the soil. Glucose had no significant effect on sulfuric soils, either at low (catalytic) or high concentrations, while acetate significantly increased pH. Molasses (which may contain small amounts of nitrogen) caused moderate changes in pH, Eh and sulfate content. On sulfidic soils, acetate prevented oxidation but glucose strongly acidified the soil, most probably by fermentation to butyric acid. The effects of live roots on sulfidic and sulfuric soil chemistry under either aerobic or anaerobic soil conditions were investigated using Typha, Phragmites and Melaleuca. Typha and Melaleuca are respectively common wetland and inland plants, whereas Phragmites grows under both wetland and inland soil conditions. The study was extended to investigate the combined effects of incorporated ground Phragmites leaves as organic matter and Phragmites plants together. Generally, a great deal of variability was found in the changes in pH, redox and sulfate content, the overall effects being dependent on plant type, whether there was incorporated organic matter, the type of soil and the moisture conditions. However, in all cases the growth of the live plants resulted in greater acidity than in the unplanted control soils. In the case of Typha and Phragmites, which have aerenchymatous tissues, the acidification under anaerobic conditions was attributed to the transport of oxygen in these tissues into the soil. Under non-flooded conditions, the acidification was most likely due to increased oxygen penetration as a result of loosening of the soil by the plant roots. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The {{shortage}} and overconsumption of our (finite) {{energy resources}} (i) {{as well as}} increasingly contaminated water supplies arising from industrial wastewaters (ii) represent significant global threats. Environmental biotechnology potentially offers biological solutions to these two fundamental problems. This project aims to use environmental biotechnology to overcome the technical barriers involved in both the generation of alternative bioenergy and the biodegradation of textile industrial effluent in wastewaters. The research begins with the isolation, purification and characterisation of lignocelluolose degrading microbial isolates (bacteria and fungi) and the subsequent assessment of the environmental biotechnological potential of these isolates {{in relation to the}} two areas. A rapid approach to the screening, isolation, purification and identification of the lignocellulolytic derivative potential of microbial isolates was developed based on the activity against a variety of ball-milled straws (wheat, rice sugarcane and <b>pea</b> <b>straw)</b> using a Biolog (MT 2) microplate-based assay as an alternative and effective method compared to the existing traditional methods that are costly, time consuming and largely not environmentally friendly. Sixty bacterial and fifty fungal isolates were successfully isolated mainly from compost and soil located from an old straw pile. Thirty bacterial isolates that showed high lignocellulolytic activity were screened (for three lignocellulolytic activities; cellulase, xylanase, strawase) using both conventional methodologies (crude enzyme production; submerged mode) and by the developed Biolog (MT 2) microplate-based assay. Biolog (MT 2) microplate arrays resulted in significant positive correlations (R 2 values up to 0. 86) between Biolog and the traditional enzyme methodologies with respect to bacterial isolates and their lignocellulosic activities. The results confirmed the suitability of Biolog microplate-based assays as an alternative screening method for lignocellulolytic bacteria. Differences between the degradability of different straws material were found to be consistent with differences in the surface structure of these different straws observed by ESEM suggesting that ball-milled sugarcane and rice straws were degraded more readily than other straws. In the second part of this study, the biotechnological potential of these lignocellulose degrading isolates were further examined using a novel approach involving co-culture of microbial isolates using four fungal and five bacterial isolates (selected out of 18 fungal and 30 bacterial isolates) for the construction of dual and triple defined microbial combinations. Co-culturing was used to investigate and understand the synergistic effects on saccharification of four different ball-milled straw substrates: wheat, rice, sugarcane and pea and comparison with the individual isolates. Some fungal and bacterial combinations such as Neosartorya fischeri&ndash;Myceliophthora thermophila and Aeromonas hydrophila&ndash;Pseudomonas poae enhanced higher saccharification (3 - and 6. 6 fold respectively) compared with their monocultures indicating the beneficial and compatible synergetic effects of mixed cultures. Ball-milled rice and sugarcane straws which had similar Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) profiles were more degradable, inducing more hydrolytic enzyme production than wheat and pea straws. The result highlights the potential of microbial co-culturing to improve saccharification of lignocellulosic substrates. In the third part of this study the ability of fungal isolates were further examined, in this case to overcome the technical barriers involved in the production of biofuels from microalgae (3 rd generation). The high-energy input required for harvesting of microalgal biomass (using existing harvesting techniques) can account for up to 50 % of the total cost of biofuels production. Co-cultivation of fungal (oleaginous) and microalgal cells is receiving increasing attention because of the high efficiency of bio-flocculation of microalgal cells (up to 90 %) with no requirement for added chemicals and low energy inputs. Screening of the new fungal isolates for their ability to bioflocculate 11 different microalgae representing freshwater, marine, small (5 &micro;m), large (over 300 &micro;m), heterotrophic, photoautotrophic, motile and non-motile strains (most of these strains are commercially used for biofuels production) led to the identification of one fungal isolate, the filamentous fungus A. fumigatus as being capable of efficiently harvesting 10 of the 11 microalgal strains. The harvested fungal-microalgal pellets showed additive and synergistic effects, increasing biomass production and lipid yields. Further, the ability of A. fumigatus/Thraustochytrid (Af/Thr) and A. fumigatus/T. chuii (Af/Tc) pellets to further grow in (25 % and 10 %) swine wastewater as an alternative and sustainable source of nutrient supply was investigated. The incubation of both fungal-microalgal pellets for 48 h in 10 % wastewater resulted in the removal of 96 % of NH 4 + and 84 % of PO 4 - 3 in the wastewater together with a lipid yield and biomass increase of 1. 4 -fold for both pellets. The results confirmed the suitability and the commercial applicability of bioflocculation process using A. fumigatus for harvesting marine and freshwater microalgal strains effectively. The final part of this study investigated the ability of another new isolate (thermophilic fungi) to treat industrial wastewater arising from the textile industry. Microorganisms can adsorb dyes via metabolism dependent or independent mechanisms, although fungal biomass is more frequently used for bioadsorption. Dye effluents are generally discharged at relatively high temperature between 50 &deg;C and 60 &deg;C. Here, the dye decolourizing abilities of a thermophilic fungal isolate, Thermomucor indicae-seudaticae at different temperatures (30, 45 and 55 &deg;C) and dye concentrations (100, 500 and 1000 mg l- 1) were investigated in an azo&ndash;anthraquinone dye mixture (Azure B, Congo Red, Trypan Blue and Remazol Brilliant Blue R) over 6 days. Assays with living and inactivated T. indicae-seudaticae, Aspergillus fumigatus and the combined culture indicated that inactivated fungi were substantially better at dye decolourization. Inactivated T. indicae-seudaticae was a faster and more effective dye decolourizer in the temperature range, 30 &ndash; 55 &deg;C at 100, 500 and 1000 mg l- 1 concentrations over 12 h than either A. fumigatus or the combined culture. At 1000 mg l- 1 and 55 &deg;C, Thermomucor adsorbed up to 1. 7 -fold (74. 93 % decolourization) more than Aspergillus (44. 67 %) over 12 h. The results highlight the potential of using thermophilic fungus; T. indicae-seudaticae (for the first time) as a significant biological-agent for dye adsorption significantly at elevated temperatures and concentrations using activated and inactivated biomass. In summary, this study has demonstrated the importance of microbial isolations, based on novel isolation and screening techniques to quickly assess their lignocellulolytic activity. Assessment of the environmental biotechnological potential of these microbial isolates (used individually or in co-cultures) has confirmed the potential of environmental biotechnology to overcome technical barriers involved in the generation of alternative bioenergy as well as the biodegradation of wastewaters. The biological approaches of microbial strains isolated in this study represent cost effective, green technology that can be applied economically at large scale...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{salinity}} is {{a serious}} land degradation problem which reduces plant growth and microbial activity due to (1) low osmotic potential which causes plant water stress, and (2) ion toxicity and ion imbalances (nutrient deficiencies) as result of high salt concentrations in the soil solution. Therefore, salinity affects organic matter turnover by influencing the amount of organic matter input in the soil and decomposition rate. Microbial activity and biomass in saline soils have been extensively studied, but a {{little is known about}} the effect of organic carbon (OC) addition on adaptation of soil microbes to salinity. The objective of this thesis was to determine the effect of OC availability on adaptation of soil microbial activity and biomass to salinity. In most experiments described in this thesis, one non-saline and four saline soils from the field with similar texture (sandy clay loam) and electrical conductivities in a 1 : 5 soil: water extract (EC₁﹕₅) of 0. 1, 1. 1, 3. 1 and 5. 2 dS m⁻¹ or electrical conductivity of the saturation extract (ECₑ) of 1, 11, 24 and 43 dS m⁻¹ were used. In other experiments a non-saline loamy sand was amended with NaCl to achieve a range of EC levels. The optimum water content for respiration was determined by incubating the soils amended with glucose at different water contents and measuring the respiration for 10 days at 25 ºC. Glucose, cellulose or pea residue was used as OC sources. Inorganic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) were added in experiments with glucose and cellulose to ensure that N and P availability did not limit microbial growth. Respiration (CO₂ release) was measured throughout the experiments; microbial biomass C (MBC) at selected sampling dates. Available N and P were measured in the first and second experiment. Microbial community structure was measured in the fifth experiment. The aim of the first experiment was to study the effect of increasing salinity on soil microbial biomass and activity at different addition rates of soluble organic C (glucose). One non-saline and three saline soils with EC₁﹕₅ of 0. 1, 1. 1, 3. 1 and 5. 2 dS m⁻¹ were amended with glucose to achieve five carbon concentrations (0, 0. 5, 1, 2. 5, 5 g C kg⁻¹). N and P were added to achieve a C/N ratio of 20 and a C/P ratio of 200. Soil respiration was measured continuously over 21 days; MBC and available N and P were determined on days 2, 5, 14 and 21. Cumulative respiration was significantly increased with addition of ≥ 0. 5 g C kg⁻¹ compared to unamended soils. Cumulative respiration decreased with increasing salinity with smaller relative decrease when C was added than in the soil without C addition. Cumulative respiration decreased with increasing salinity with the strongest decrease in the soils without C addition where, compared to EC 0. 1, it was 64 % lower at EC 1. 1 and 80 % lower at EC 5. 2. Addition of glucose reduced the negative impact of salinity; with 5 g C kg⁻¹ cumulative respiration decreased by 2 % at EC 1. 1 and 21 % at EC 5. 2. MBC concentration was negatively correlated with EC at all C rates and at each sampling date. Addition of C resulted in N and P immobilisation in the first 5 days. Biomass turnover released N and P after day 14, especially in the soils with low EC. It can be concluded that microbes are less affected by increasing EC when they are provided with easily available C. The second experiment was conducted to determine the response of soil microbes to salinity when supplied with different OC forms. One non-saline and three saline soils were amended with 2. 5 and 5 g C kg⁻¹ as glucose or cellulose, soluble N and P were added to achieve a C/N= 20 and C/P= 200. Microbial biomass C and available N and P were determined on days 2, 7, 14 and 21. Cumulative respiration decreased gradually with increasing EC when supplied with glucose, whereas with cellulose it decreased sharply from non-saline to saline soils but differed little among saline soils. Microbial biomass C and available N and P concentrations were highest in the non-saline soil but did not differ among the saline soils. Microbial biomass C concentration was higher and available N was lower with 5 g C kg⁻¹ than with 2. 5 g C kg⁻¹. With glucose, microbial biomass was highest on day 2 and then decreased, whereas available N was lowest on day 2 and then increased. With cellulose, microbial biomass C increased gradually over time and available N decreased gradually. It is concluded that salinity decreased the ability of microbes to utilise cellulose more than glucose utilisation. Two incubation experiments (Experiments 3 and 4) were conducted to investigate the effect of increasing EC on microbial biomass and activity when OC was added once in different proportions of glucose and cellulose or when the carbon form is changed over time. Experiment 3 was carried out using three sandy clay loam soils: a non-saline soil and two saline soils (ECe 11 and 43 dS m⁻¹) amended with 5 g C kg⁻¹ as different percentages of glucose and cellulose. The percentages of glucose (G) were 100 % and 0 - 20 % and those of cellulose (Ce) were 0 - 100 %. The fourth experiment was conducted with a non-saline loamy sandy soil which was adjusted to ECe 12. 5 and 37. 4 dS m⁻¹ by addition of NaCl. The form of organic C was maintained or changed over time by adding 1. 5 g C kg⁻¹ every two weeks (on days 0, 15 and 29) as glucose (G) or cellulose (Ce) : (Ce+Ce+Ce, G+G+G, Ce+Ce+G, G+Ce+Ce, G+Ce+G, Ce+G+Ce). Experiment 3 showed that compared to 100 % cellulose, cumulative respiration was increased by mixing small amounts of glucose with cellulose, but the impact of glucose proportion differed with soil EC. Cumulative respiration increased with increasing glucose proportion in the combined treatments when the proportion of glucose was > 2. 5 %. With 100 % G cumulative respiration was greater in the non-saline soil than in the soil EC 43, however with 100 % Ce and all combined treatments, cumulative respiration was significantly higher in the non-saline than in soils EC 11 and EC 43. There was no further decrease in cumulative respiration from EC 11 to EC 43 when amended by 100 % Ce but it decreased significantly from EC 11 to EC 43 in the combined treatments except with 10 % G. The MBC concentration was lower in saline soils than in the non- saline soil. In Experiment 4, the impact of salinity on cumulative respiration in the two weeks following OC addition depended on C form, treatment and period. Regardless of C form added, the effect of salinity was reduced when C was added repeatedly compared to the first addition indicating that high C availability increases microbial tolerance to salinity. Cumulative respiration increased when glucose was added after cellulose addition. Addition of glucose after cellulose alleviated the adverse effect of high salinity on cumulative respiration compared to the previous period with cellulose or when cellulose was added after glucose. It can be concluded that, mixing small amounts of glucose with cellulose increases activity and growth of soil microbes, but may make microbes more susceptible to salinity compared to cellulose alone. The study also indicated that irrespective of C form added, microbial activity and biomass were less influenced by salinity when C was added frequently compared to the first addition showing that high C availability decreases the negative impact of salinity on soil microbes. To investigate the effect of increasing EC on microbial biomass and activity with repeated addition of plant residues, the fifth experiment was carried out with a non-saline soil (loamy sand, ECe 1 dS m⁻¹) amended with different amounts of NaCl to achieve ECe 12. 5, 25 and 50 dS m⁻¹. Two rates of pea residue equivalent to 3. 9 and 7. 8 g C kg⁻¹ (3. 9 C and 7. 8 C) were added on days 0, 15 and 29. In the saline soils compared to the first addition, cumulative respiration per g C added was higher after the second and third addition except with 3. 9 C at EC 50. Compared to the first addition, the relative increase in cumulative respiration in the saline soils was greater with 7. 8 C than with 3. 9 C. At the end of experiment, the percentage of added C remaining was lowest at non-saline soil and increased with increasing salinity levels. The MBC concentration at the end of experiment was significantly lower than in the nonsaline soil at EC 25 and EC 50 with 3. 9 C, but only at EC 50 with 7. 8 C. Salinity changed the microbial community composition on day 42 assessed by phospholipid fatty acids, but only in the amended soils. It can be concluded that repeated residue addition reduced the adverse effect of salinity on cumulative respiration which indicates that limiting periods of low substrate availability can enhance the adaptation of soil microbes to salinity. This positive effect of residue addition was observed although salinity changed microbial community composition, suggesting that OC addition enables the development of a microbial community that can better adapt to salinity. The aim of the sixth experiment was to assess the response of soil microbes to increasing salinity in rhizosphere compared to non-rhizosphere (bulk) soil using the nonsaline soil (ECe 1 dS m⁻¹). The soil was adjusted to ECe 13 and 19 dS m⁻¹ by adding NaCl and placed in pots. Barley was planted in half of the pots to obtain rhizosphere soil whereas unplanted pots were used for generation of bulk soil. The pots were placed in a greenhouse and soil moisture was maintained throughout by weight. After 5 weeks the planted and unplanted pots were harvested to collect rhizosphere and bulk soils to be used for the following incubation experiment. The EC levels (EC 1, EC 13 and EC 19) from the pot experiment (referred to as original) were either maintained or adjusted to ECe 13, 19, 31 and 44 dS m⁻¹ by adding different amounts of NaCl. Cumulative respiration and microbial biomass C in rhizosphere and bulk soil decreased with increasing adjusted EC. Across the whole range of adjusted ECs, the decrease in cumulative respiration with increasing EC did not differ between rhizosphere and bulk soil. However, compared to the treatments where the EC was maintained, the percentage decrease in cumulative respiration when the EC was increased to EC 44 was smaller in rhizosphere than in bulk soil. The smaller decrease in microbial activity at the highest EC level in rhizosphere compared to bulk soil suggests that rhizosphere microbes may be less affected by high salinity than bulk soil microbes. Experiment 7 aimed to determine the response of soil microbial activity and biomass to drying and rewetting of non-saline and saline soils when the salinity levels were maintained or increased upon rewetting. A non- saline loamy sand (EC₁﹕₅ 0. 1 dS m⁻¹) was salinized with NaCl to achieve EC₁﹕₅ of 1. 5 and 3. 5 dS m⁻¹ (initial EC). The soils were amended <b>pea</b> <b>straw</b> at 20 g kg⁻¹ before the moisture treatments began. The soils were divided into two portions, one portion was dried for four days and the second portion was maintained at 40 % of water holding capacity (WHC). The soils were then wetted to 75 % WHC with either water to maintain the EC (EC 0. 1, EC 1. 5 or EC 3. 5) or amended with NaCl to achieve the following EC levels: EC 0. 1 was increased to 1. 5, 2. 5 and 3. 5 dS m⁻¹. EC 1. 5 was adjusted to 2. 5 and 3. 5 dS m⁻¹ and EC 3. 5 was increased to 4. 5 dS m⁻¹. A respiration flush upon rewetting only occurred in the initially non-saline soil when the EC was maintained, but not when the EC was increased. At the end of the experiment (day 25), cumulative respiration was higher in the dried and rewet (DRW) treatment compared to the treatment that was maintained moist (CM) only in the initially non-saline soil when the EC was not increased. Cumulative respiration decreased with increasing EC compared to the treatments where the EC was maintained only in treatments with initially EC 0. 1 where the reduction was greater in DRW compared to CM. The MBC concentration was higher in the treatments in which the EC was maintained compared to the treatments where the EC was increased in both moisture treatments. When the EC was increased, the MBC concentration at the end of the experiment was greater in DRW compared to CM only in soil with initial EC 0. 1. However, in the saline soils (EC 1. 5 and EC 3. 5) when the EC was maintained or increased; the MBC concentration did not differ between moisture treatments. The experiment showed that in the initial nonsaline soil, increasing the EC upon rewetting inhibits the ability of microbes to decompose substrates released after rewetting. Drying and rewetting did not consistently increase the sensitivity of soil microbes to salinity compared to constantly moist soil. Thesis (Ph. D.)
