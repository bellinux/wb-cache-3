[...] Even by the strict disciplinary standards of the Royal Navy, Arbuthnot's zeal was unusual; in 1900 as executive officer of Royal Sovereign, Arbuthnot wrote and published A Battleship Commander's Order Book, containing some 300 pages of detailed standing orders for his crew, when a ship's Commander at this time would typically produce just a few pages of special instructions to act as an addendum to the standardized King's Regulations <b>procedural</b> <b>manual.</b> While the book remains a valuable source of historical information on details of life aboard a battleship at this time, it made Arbuthnot the butt of so many jokes from his contemporaries that he later allegedly requested it not be mentioned in his biographical entry in Who's Who in the Navy. Aside from his love of discipline, he also continued his obsession with physical and spiritual fitness, spending several hours each day performing strenuous exercises on deck, rain or shine, attending daily church services and lecturing his crew on Christian virtue. Although largely regarded with bemused admiration by his superiors and respectful fear by his subordinates, his extreme nature caused some to consider him a fanatic; Gordon describes him as [...] "in a colloquial if not a clinical sense, insane." ...|$|E

The objective of establishing this manual is to furnish a model of how to plan, conduct and evaluate an event from start to finish. In addition, this manual will provide a learning experience for students outside the classroom, e. g.,operating game promotions/activities. Ball State University has a Sports Administration Club that is governed by student leadership. Historically this club provides students with opportunities to gain administrative experience, e. g., hosting intramural basketball tournaments. Ball State University (BSU) also has a National Strength and Conditioning Association Student Chapter (NSCA-SC) club whose mandate is to provide leadership with issues of student fitness e. g., serving {{as a resource for}} personal training. The NSCA-SC was not established to promote administrative experiences or organize events. Despite this responsibility the NSCA-SC has been the governing body for conducting the BSUBodybuilding Competition for the past several years. The NSCA-SC has never documented procedures used for conducting the bodybuilding competition. This project will produce a <b>procedural</b> <b>manual</b> for planning and conducting the BSU Bodybuilding Competition. The manual will emphasize student leadership.

In {{the first year}} of the four year Au. D. program at USF, students are enrolled in Audiology Laboratory Clinic I, II, and III, in consecutive semesters. Groups of four to six students meet weekly for a 3 - 1 / 2 hour clinical laboratory session to receive training in test instruction, test procedures, test application, and test interpretation. The purpose of the first year Audiology laboratory clinic sessions is to prepare the student for clinical experience in year two of the Au. D program at USF. In preparation for these laboratory sessions, it was discovered that materials related to test procedures are currently scattered throughout a variety of texts, journals, manuals, educational software, videos, and web sites. No one source contains all the needed information on any given test procedure. In addition, specific procedures outlined in documents [American Standards Institute (ANSI) and the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) ] are not consistently used by the different sources. Thus, there is no standard <b>procedural</b> <b>manual</b> containing laboratory assignments that lead to the development of appropriate clinical testing skills by a first year Au. D student. A standard test <b>procedural</b> <b>manual</b> for pure tone audiometry, speech audiometry, and immittance testing, with assignments, was developed to assist in the cultivation of the students testing skills.

40|$|Phase I of the Transuranic (TRU) Waste Facility Line Item Project {{includes}} the retrieval and safe storage of the pad drums that are stored on TRU pads 2 - 6 in the Solid Waste Disposal Facility (SWDF). Drums containing TRU waste {{were placed on}} these pads as early as 1974. The pads, once filled, were mounded with soil. The retrieval activities will include the excavation of the soil, retrieval of the pad drums, placing the drums in overpacks (if necessary) and venting and purging the retrieved drums. Once the drums have been vented and purged, they will be transported to other pads within the SWDF or in a designated area until they are eventually treated as necessary for ultimate shipment to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in Carlsbad, New Mexico. This safety evaluation provides a bounding assessment of the radiological risk involved with the drum retrieval activities to the maximally exposed offsite individual and the co-located worker.

40|$|This {{handbook}} is a {{guide for}} facilities maintenance managers. Its objective is to set minimum facilities maintenance standards. It also provides recommendations on how to meet the standards to ensure that NASA maintains its facilities {{in a manner that}} protects and preserves its investment in the facilities in a cost-effective manner while safely and efficiently performing its mission. This handbook implements NMI 8831. 1, which states NASA facilities maintenance policy and assigns organizational responsibilities for the management of facilities maintenance activities on all properties under NASA jurisdiction. It is a reference for facilities maintenance managers, not a step-by-step <b>procedural</b> <b>manual.</b> Because of the differences in NASA Field Installation organizations, this handbook does not assume or recommend a typical facilities maintenance organization. Instead, it uses a systems approach to describe the functions that should be included in any facilities maintenance management system, regardless of its organizational structure. For documents referenced in the handbook, the most recent version of the documents is applicable. This handbook is divided into three parts: Part 1 specifies common definitions and facilities maintenance requirements and amplifies the policy requirements contained in NMI 8831. 1; Part 2 provides guidance on how to meet the requirements of Part 1, containing recommendations only; Part 3 contains general facilities maintenance information. One objective of this handbook is to fix commonality of facilities maintenance definitions among the Centers. This will permit the application of uniform measures of facilities conditions, of the relationship between current replacement value and maintenance resources required, and of the backlog of deferred facilities maintenance. The utilization of facilities maintenance system functions will allow the Centers to quantitatively define maintenance objectives in common terms, prepare work plans, and develop management information in order to statistically identify and analyze variances from those plans. It will also add credibility to the NASA facilities maintenance budgeting process. The key to a successful maintenance program is the understanding and support of the senior Center managers...|$|E
40|$|Legal {{history and}} the social history of law have become very active fields of {{research}} in Britain, the United States, and Canada {{in the past ten}} years. Moreover, they have begun to affect each other, so that social historians are now much more sensitive to doctrinal changes, shifts in legal rules, and legal concepts, while legal historians increasingly appreciate that explaining legal change – or the lack of it – may require extensive research outside the law library. In short, lawyers and historians are beginning to meet not only in law libraries, but also in archives. And, like all users, they are asking the impossible. From law librarians, they want every variant edition of every obscure and outdated <b>procedural</b> <b>manual,</b> every ancient set of reports, and every printed trial extant for earlier centuries. Fortunately, large international microfilming projects are increasingly making it possible for librarians to supply all of these, and seen extensive manuscript collections of legal materials. But historians of law make more outrageous demands on archivists: retain everything, prepare finding aids for everything, manage your collections with us, above all others, in mind. I am told that the professional duties of archivists include measuring such demands by the tests of budgets, conservation imperatives, the interests of other users, the finite dimension of the working year, available shortage space, and a healthy instinct for preservation of self as well as collections. But since I am a user, not an archivist, I shall innocently describe utopia, and say little about how to get there. My only excuse for doing so is that legal records, like all records, present specific problems, problems that are not particularly evident without close familiarity with the recent large research literature, much of it still in dissertation form, on the legal and social history of the law. A review of some of its themes may help archivists, lawyers, and historians to discuss some of the hard decisions about retention. One of my conclusion is that lawyers and historians may in fact have rather different professional imperatives, even conflicting ones, and that the historically and legally informed archivist will necessarily {{play a critical role in}} adjudicating between them...|$|E
40|$|Measurements {{of carbon}} uptake by lake {{plankton}} {{at different levels}} of added phosphorus reveal some phytoplankton strategies that contribute to their survival in low-nutrient waters. Nutrient-deficient populations seem to temporarily reduce, rather than enhance, photosyn-thesis when phosphorus becomes available. This contradicts the basic hypothesis of the i 4 C bioassay used to determine “limiting ” nutrients in natural waters. The reduction of carbon uptake rate continues until either the nutrient addition is taken up or no further storage is possible; at this time carbon upake may be enhanced. Concurrent measurements of phos-phorus uptake showed no light response unless the plankton were exposed to significant phosphorus concentrations in the dark for several hours. Phytoplankton seem to be adapted for and dependent upon intermittent events exposing them to nutrient-enriched water. The ability of phosphate-depleted plankton to take up phosphate in excess of their growth re-quirements was used to develop an index for phosphate deficiency. To normalize for different biomass levels, the optimum photosynthetic rate was divided by the maximum uptake velocity giving a range for the C:P maximum uptake from 1. 2 to 206 for plankton samples of varying phosphate deficiency. The hypothesis that a rapid increase in photosynthetic rate would ensue within 4 - 6 h following the addition of a nutrient limiting the growth of algae has been widely accepted by many researchers in both freshwater and marine systems. The assay technique based on this hypothesis is described in <b>procedural</b> <b>manuals</b> (Vol...|$|R

Yet, mortality information is crucial for establishing mortality patterns over time and for estimating mortality attributed to specific causes. In Ghana, in deaths occurring in homes and those occurring within 48 hours after admission into health facilities, autopsies remain the appropriate option for determining the cause of death. Although these organ-based autopsies may generate convincing results and are considered the ‘gold standard’ tools for ascertainments of causes of death, procedural and practical constraints could limit {{the extent to which}} autopsy results can be accepted and/or trusted. The objective of our study was to identify and characterise the procedural and practical constraints as well as to assess their potential effects on autopsy outcomes in Ghana. We interviewed 10 Ghanaian pathologists and collected and evaluated <b>procedural</b> <b>manuals</b> and operational procedures for the conduct of autopsies.

On the basis of the impressions of the expert panel, it was concluded that mortality data generated from autopsies in urban settings in Ghana were of sufficiently high quality to guarantee valid use in health analysis...|$|R

40|$|Computer {{technology}} is rapidly becoming a necessary component of school curricula {{as a result}} of societal dependence upon computers. Unfortunately, classroom application is disturbingly lacking. An extremely low percentage of schoolteachers feel comfortable using computers as an instructional classroom tool. Thus, school systems are faced with the daunting task of training teachers to use computers for instruction. Unfortunately, conventional training methods, which require teachers to sit in workshops and magically transform the experience into classroom practice, have proven unsuccessful. More effective results can be obtained with ongoing professional development through the use of online delivery of content supported by peer mentors. In order to effectively improve computer technology integration it the classroom, a program was developed that supported teachers {{in such a way as}} to foster practical application. Peer mentorship, workshops, and Web-based training have individually proven somewhat effective with improving computer use in the classroom. However, each solution has several deficiencies that can be compensated by the others. A combination of mentors, workshops, and online training examined during this study appeared to significantly improve the quality and instance of technology integration in the classroom. The development of such a training program was accomplished through a process of criteria development and validation that included representatives of all stakeholders in the process. In order to codify a combined mentor, workshop, and online technology-training program, a <b>procedural</b> <b>manual</b> was developed.

40|$|Human {{error is}} an {{inevitable}} existence {{in virtually all}} tasks in which an issue arises as humans are almost always directly or indirectly involved with the process. Researchers have examined many past accidents and catastrophic events for the types of human error involved and found inadequate training, deviation from procedures and insufficient knowledge, especially in critical and emergency situations, {{to be among the}} most common root causes of these incidents. However, within the field of research aiming to resolve the issue of lack of operator knowledge, researchers have yet to perform studies regarding how to equip operators with this knowledge {{and the extent to which}} providing training on important knowledge and concepts can help improve their process operation and prevent human error. The objective of this research is to examine the impact of improving operators’ understanding on the following 4 aspects of their process operation: 1) performance, 2) adherence to instructions, 3) emergency response, and 4) retention of learned knowledge and skills. In particular, this study focuses on the use of training manuals as a method of improving operators’ understanding. An experiment was conducted where participants were trained to operate a hydraulic pump system using either an explanatory training manual, which describes both ‘what’ needs to be done and ‘why’ it needs to be done, or a procedural training manual, which only describes ‘what’ needs to be done. Participants were then asked to manipulate process variables to achieve production requirements while meeting operating criteria in scenarios that exemplify both real-world normal operation and emergency situations. The results of this experiment indicate that type of manual and educational background showed no significant effect on participants’ operation time and accuracy performance of control operations or on the appropriateness of their response to an emergency scenario. However, type of manual was found to have a significant effect on procedural adherence, where participants using an explanatory manual showed greater adherence to procedures compared to those using a <b>procedural</b> <b>manual,</b> though these findings were not replicated for adherence to wait times. All participants also significantly increased in understanding of the process after participating in the training session, with similar levels of knowledge retained after approximately 2 weeks and chemical engineering participants outscoring those from other faculties overall on the questionnaires. These findings identified the usefulness of incorporating explanatory information within a training manual and the aspects of process operation in which an increase in operator understanding was shown to improve. It provided evidence on the importance of operator training and understanding of vital concepts and its impact across the production process, as well as provided insight into the development of better and more appropriate training programs...|$|E

The development of public works under the approach named "PPP" (public private partnership) has highlighted the central role of the operational phase of the buildings and has also underlined the multiple and articulated consequences that the previous phases (e. g. design and construction) may have on the last one. The organization of information is therefore of strategic importance for the success of complex projects; in order to do that, the organization must be able to connect, combine and aggregate into a single management system the multiple and heterogeneous information coming from the different stages of the construction process. To this aim, knowledge management and project management methods and tools should be appropriately combined. The industrial perspective of the work - named Information Management System of the Public Work (SgIOP) - is the set up of <b>procedural</b> <b>manuals</b> to support the public administrations and to develop computerized information management systems to be used in project and facility management. The paper presents the organizational structure and the mode to represent the processes that are necessary {{for the construction of a}} procedural information system (SgIOP) in order to regulate the information produced/used in the different stages of the construction process relating to public works; planning, design, construction, verification and validation, inspection during construction, design of maintenance services, monitoring during the operation and maintenance. The first results obtained describe progress, in terms of effectiveness and efficiency for the public administration, of the processes and sub-processes affected by the use of SgIOP; the same results also lead to further investigations within the area of interest of BIM (Building Information Modeling) ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Procedural</b> and Coding <b>Manual</b> was {{developed}} by the Task Force in school psychology for the identification of psychological and educational intervention studies with empirical support (Kratochwill & Stoiber, 2002). The Coding Workbook (Shernoff & Kratochwill, 2004) was later designed to supplement the Manual with more explicit coding directions and illustrations for application of the coding criteria. The Coding Workbook has yet to be published or studied through formal research to determine its usefulness for the training of school psychologists. The present study evaluated Workbook effectiveness by conducting the training and measuring pre-and post-training differences in inter-rater correspondence and coding time. In addition, reviewers evaluated the merits and challenges of the training process in detailed observation logs. Results of the study demonstrated that enhanced coding instructions and examples are needed to increase usefulness of the Workbook for training school psychologists...|$|R
40|$|Methods of {{eliminating}} or reducing underbread cracking in multipass GTA welds in thick T- 111 plate were studied. Single V butt welds prepared using experimental filler metal compositions and standard weld procedures resulted in only moderate success in reducing underbread cracking. Subsequent <b>procedural</b> changes incorporating <b>manual</b> welding, slower weld speeds, and three or fewer fill passes resulted in crack-free single V welds {{only when the}} filler metal was free of hafnium. The double V joint design with successive fill passes {{on opposite sides of}} the joint produced excellent welds. The quality of each weld was determined metallographically since the cracking, when present, was very slight and undetectable using standard NDT techniques. Tensile and bend tests were performed on selected weldments. The inherent filler metal strength and the joint geometry determined the strength of the weldment. Hardness and electron beam microprobe traverses were made on selected specimens with the result that significant filler metal-base metal dilution as well as hafnium segregation was detected. A tentative explanation of T- 111 plate underbread cracking is presented based on the intrinsic effects of hafnium in the weldment...|$|R
40|$|In this work, a novel {{approach}} to scientific visualization and steerable texture synthesis is presented. Vector field visualization and synthesis techniques for controlled, field-driven texture generation are proposed, discussed, and extended to allow more control and degrees of freedom in the image creation. Concepts from perception and cognition, as well as statistical theory for standard texture synthesis, were investigated and used to motivate and improve the proposed techniques. The approach results to be general, flexible, and open to further extensions and integrations. Vector fields can be visualized in a straightforward manner by setting the color of output pixels {{on the base of}} computed similarity functions. The proposed method is texture-based and it locally adapts and transforms a chosen basic pattern of an anisotropic texture to represent the features and the variation of the field. In general, it allows any <b>procedural</b> or <b>manual</b> way to define a mapping from vector space to example image space, offering arbitrary degrees of freedom in representing the appearance of the resulting field. The {{approach to}} visualization of vectorial data sets can be interpreted as an hybrid algorithm, which combines features of direct intuitive visualization, such as simplicity, intuitivity, generality, together with features from dense visualization techniques, such as powerful information encoding, locality of calculation, accuracy. The variety of tasks and the different level of expertise and experience of users motivate and strongly require such versatility. The steerable generation of non-homogeneous textures offers several degrees of freedom in the synthesis process, allowing a variety of effects for appealing output images. Textural elements used as primitive provide for this task a numerous set of visual dimensions for arbitrary variation. In general, the proposed techniques bring together concepts from human vision and perception, statistics and texture synthesis, and visualization, in an interesting interdisciplinary research that promises encouraging results for several fields of applications...|$|R
