50|$|A {{cake and}} <b>pie</b> <b>server,</b> also called a cake shovel, pie knife, crépe spade, pie-getter or pie lifter, is a serving utensil {{used in the}} cutting and serving of pies and cakes. Some cakes and pie servers have {{serrated}} edges. Another use can be to serve pizza.|$|E
5000|$|Snicket {{describes}} {{a dinner party}} in which [...] "at least two guests were disguised as desserts". As Bertrand Baudelaire is about to cut into these desserts and several guests are passing around [...] "the sugar bowl", Sunny Baudelaire sees {{a man with an}} [...] "exceptionally large and sharp" [...] nose looking through the window and shrieks, [...] "Funcoot!", which Snicket glosses as, [...] "I believe I may have seen someone lurking outside" [...] ("Al Funcoot" [...] is an anagrammatic pseudonym of Count Olaf). Klaus, having just read Taking the Teeth Out of Teething, believes that Sunny is teething, prompting Violet to create a device using [...] "a silver <b>pie</b> <b>server</b> and the ear of the snowman ice sculpture" [...] (likely one and the same as [...] "the guest disguised as the ice sculpture who wore a bowtie") to soothe Sunny's teeth. The figure in the window disappears, and Sunny calms down. Snicket concludes that the occasion was a [...] "fateful event".|$|E
40|$|In our "Future Directions for Astronomical Image Display" project, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) and the National Optical Astronomy Observatories (NOAO) {{will evolve}} our {{existing}} image display software into a fully extensible, cross-platform image display server that can run stand-alone or be integrated seamlessly into astronomical analysis systems. We {{will build a}} Plug-in Image Extension (<b>PIE)</b> <b>server</b> for astronomy, consisting of a modular image display engine that can be customized using "plug-in" technology. We will create plug-ins that reproduce all the current functionality of SAOtng. We also will devise a messaging system {{and a set of}} distributed, shared data objects to support integrating the <b>PIE</b> <b>server</b> into astronomical analysis systems. Finally, we will migrate our <b>PIE</b> <b>server,</b> plug-ins, and messaging software from Unix and the X Window System to a platform-independent architecture that utilizes cross-platform technology such as Tcl/Tk or Java...|$|E

5000|$|In the mid-1970s, {{he moved}} to rural West Virginia and started selling wooden works {{including}} cutting boards, <b>pie</b> <b>servers,</b> canes, knife racks, and spoons at regional craft fairs. [...] At Winterfair, an annual Ohio Designer Craftsmen show in Columbus, Ohio, he met studio furniture maker Bobby Reed Falwell, who encouraged him to focus on spoons and to see spoons as small sculptures. [...] He was an assistant for 18 months at Falwell's studio in Murray, KY in 1980-81.|$|R
40|$|A Perl Inference Engine (PIE), A Plan Executor (APE), and a Centroid Classifier (CCL) are {{described}} within the infrastructure {{provided by the}} Knowledge Server Toolkit (KST) environment. All these tools are implemented as Perl modules so that user 2 ̆ 7 s applications can easily use their capabilities. This technology was developed at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center under a task that was looking into languages and tools that are useful for automating satellite ground control systems. However, because these tools are modularized and knowledge driven, this technology should be generally applicable to many fields. After a background description, the Knowledge Representation (KR) and search strategy used by PIE {{are described}}. PIE applications are described next and include a simple data checker filter and a <b>PIE</b> Knowledge <b>Server</b> (PIEKS). Then, some simple monitors that display raw and inferred data are also described. These include real-time displays of alpha-numeric data and plots of raw and calculated data. Next, the environment of APE (APE is a client of PIEKS) and its KR are described. A description of a CCL server follows. CCL allows the user to define fuzzy classifier applications and therefore the code should prove useful as a template for writing neural net classifier servers. Finally, the application of KST to automating the Earth Observing System Data and Operations System (EDOS) is briefly described...|$|R
