5|$|Nowhere was demobilization more of {{a problem}} than at Los Alamos, where there was an exodus of talent. Much {{remained}} to be done. The bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were like laboratory pieces; work would be required to make them simpler, safer and more reliable. Implosion methods needed to be developed for uranium in place of the wasteful gun method, and composite uranium-plutonium cores were needed now that plutonium was in short supply because of the problems with the reactors. However, uncertainty {{about the future of the}} laboratory made it hard to induce <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay.</b> Oppenheimer returned to his job at the University of California and Groves appointed Norris Bradbury as an interim replacement. In fact, Bradbury would remain in the post for the next 25 years. Groves attempted to combat the dissatisfaction caused by the lack of amenities with a construction program that included an improved water supply, three hundred houses, and recreation facilities.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Gladys {{became a}} {{tropical}} storm, the NHC issued gale warnings for the Florida Keys {{and later a}} hurricane watch for the southwest Florida coast from the Florida Keys to Clearwater. After Gladys entered the Gulf of Mexico, the NHC issued hurricane warnings for the Florida Keys to Cedar Key, with a watch to St. Marks. Later, hurricane warnings were issued from Charleston, South Carolina to Hatteras, North Carolina. Before Gladys made landfall in Florida, all schools in Pinellas County were closed, and officials evacuated 60jet fighters from MacDill Air Force Base to Mississippi. The HMS Sirius, which was visiting St. Petersburg, rode out the storm in the open Gulf of Mexico. The American Red Cross opened shelters across western Florida for <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in during the storm, and about 40,000people evacuated their homes during the storm's passage. Then-governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. ordered 100Florida guardsmen to assist with storm work. Shelters were set up in North Carolina, although few people evacuated.|$|E

25|$|The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, criticised safety protocols, in {{particular}} those telling <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in their flats until rescued. This advice presumed that the building's structure could contain a fire {{within a single}} flat, {{but in this case}} the fire was spreading rapidly via the building's exterior.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{advice for}} <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> put until rescued {{relied on the}} assumption that construction standards such as concrete and fire-resistant doors would allow fire services to contain a fire within one or a few affected flats.

25|$|Some {{rebel groups}} vowed {{to disrupt the}} {{elections}} in any way possible, including bombing and shelling polling stations and government-controlled areas. Another statement, issued by the Ajnad al-Sham Islamic Union, the Sham Corps, the Army of Mujahedeen, and the Islamic Front, {{said they would not}} target voters but warned <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> at home in case the Syrian government did".

25|$|In Pennsylvania, Governor Ed Rendell {{declared}} a state of emergency early on the 17th which made state agencies available for assistance. It also freed counties from spending restrictions and allowed routes to be closed to non-emergency vehicles. The state also issued a travel advisory asking <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> off the roads. Many municipalities (including Philadelphia) declared their own snow emergencies which banned non-essential travel and parking on snow emergency routes. There were two snow-related deaths within Philadelphia. In the southeastern part of the state, area malls closed early on the 16th and churches cancelled services.|$|E

25|$|A {{growing economy}} that creates jobs at rate faster than {{population}} growth, offers people opportunities and incentive to relocate from poor slum to more developed neighborhoods. Economic stagnation, in contrast, creates uncertainties and risks for the poor, encouraging <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in the slums. Economic stagnation {{in a nation}} with a growing population reduces per capita disposal income in urban and rural areas, increasing urban and rural poverty. Rising rural poverty also encourages migration to urban areas. A poorly performing economy, in other words, increases poverty and rural-to-urban migration, thereby increasing slums.|$|E
25|$|This pattern slowed {{due to the}} 1975 Land Reform program instituted by the government, which {{provided}} incentives for <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in rural areas. As people moved from rural areas to the cities, there were fewer people to grow food for the population. The Land Reform Act was meant to increase agriculture since food production was not keeping up with population growth over the period of 1970–1983. This program proliferated the formation of peasant associations, large villages based on agriculture. The act did {{lead to an increase}} in food production, although there is debate over the cause; it may be related to weather conditions more than the reform act. Urban populations have continued to grow with an 8.1% increase from 1975 to 2000.|$|E
25|$|Witnesses said {{ambulances}} {{were captured}} inside {{the hospital and}} some health workers were beaten. Unable to reach Salmaniya hospital, the wounded were taken to small clinics outside the capital, which were stormed by police soon after, prompting protesters to use mosques as field clinics. Then, the army moved to opposition strongholds where it set up a number of checkpoints and thousands of riot police entered, forcing people to retreat to their homes by nightfall. The Al Wefaq party advised <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> off the streets, avoid confrontations with security forces and stay peaceful after the army had announced a nighttime 12-hour curfew in Manama and banned all sorts of public gatherings. Eight people had died that day, five by gunshot, one by birdshot and two police reportedly run over by an SUV.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of February 10, 1981, an arson fire started at the Las Vegas Hilton, {{which at the time}} was being {{retrofitted}} with modern fire safety equipment. Firefighters, using the knowledge they had learned from the MGM Grand fire, used local television networks to notify <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in their rooms and not go out to the halls and stairwells. Because of the lessons learned, only eight people died in this fire compared with the 85 people who died in the MGM Grand fire. Famed singer Natalie Cole was trapped inside the Hilton during the fire, possibly sustaining lung damage from smoke inhalation that was not detected by doctors in 1981. In 1982, Philip Bruce Cline was sentenced to eight life sentences for his role in starting the fire.|$|E
25|$|Benjamin Plotkin {{purchased}} Pinewood Lake and {{the surrounding}} acreage and built forty cabins and an auditorium with a revolving stage and incorporated as the Pine Brook Country Club in 1930. Plotkin's dream was to market the club as a summer resort for <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> and enjoy theatrical productions. Pine Brook {{is best known for}} becoming the summer rehearsal headquarters of the most important experiment in the history of American theatre. The Group Theatre was formed in New York City by Harold Clurman, Cheryl Crawford and Lee Strasberg in 1931. The group was made up of actors, directors, playwrights and producers and produced works by the most important American playwrights of the time on real-life subject matter, changing stage and film forever. In 1944, Pine Brook Country Club was sold, reorganized and chartered as the Pinewood Lake Association.|$|E
25|$|Tables {{published}} by the government's National Center for Health Statistics show that life expectancy at birth was 47.3 years in 1900, rose to 68.2 by 1950 and reached 77.3 in 2002. The latest annual report of the Social Security Agency (SSA) trustees projects that life expectancy will increase just {{six years in the}} next seven decades, to 83 in 2075. A separate set of projections, by the Census Bureau, shows more rapid growth. The Census Bureau projection is that the longer life spans projected for 2075 by the Social Security Administration will be reached in 2050. Other experts, however, think that the past gains in life expectancy cannot be repeated, and add that the adverse effect on the system's finances may be partly offset if health improvements or reduced retirement benefits induce <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in the workforce longer.|$|E
