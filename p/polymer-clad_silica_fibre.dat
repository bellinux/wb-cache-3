40|$|Recent {{advances}} in <b>silica</b> <b>fibres</b> exhibiting second-order optical nonlinearities {{as a result}} of both self-induced and thermal poling processes are reported. Efficient second-harmonic generation in <b>silica</b> <b>fibre</b> subjected to a strong electrostatic field via internal electrodes was observed. Spatial periodic modulation of the applied electric field, responsible for the second-harmonic signal, arises from the interaction of the intense light at fundamental and doubled frequencies with glass, which has its inversion symmetry broken by the applied field. The process could represent the first evidence of coherent photoconductivity in glass - conductivity being dependent on the relative phase of the light fields at different frequencies. Moreover, D-shaped <b>silica</b> <b>fibres</b> have been periodically poled at elevated temperature by applying high voltage via a patterned electrode fabricated an the planar surface and high quality quasi-phase-matching structures have been created.

40|$|Abstract—The {{literature}} {{has suggested that}} many commercially important plant species contain amorphous silica. This report provides a summary of that literature {{as well as the}} findings from a field survey in Florida of sugar-cane field workers where airborne concentrations of amorphous <b>silica</b> <b>fibres</b> were determined. In addition to the fibre analysis, concentrations of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and total airborne dust were also determined. It was confirmed that biogenic amorphous <b>silica</b> <b>fibres</b> exist in the mature sugar-cane leafand that these fibres become airborne during the manual harvesting of the cane after the leaf is burned. Airborne amorphous <b>silica</b> <b>fibres</b> that were found were 3. 5 - 65;im long (mean = 12;im) with an average diameter of 0. 6 /im. Air concentrations were calculated to be as high as 300 000 fibres m " 3 of air during cane cutting. Some PAH compounds were found to be present in the burnt leaf but the concentrations were below the limits of detection in the air.

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} on the strain and {{pressure}} testing of highly flexible skins embedded with Bragg grating sensors recorded in either silica or polymer optical fibre. The photonic skins, with a size of 10 cm x 10 cm and thickness of 1 mm, were fabricated by embedding the polymer <b>fibre</b> or <b>silica</b> <b>fibre</b> containing Bragg gratings in Sylgard 184 from Dow Corning. Pressure sensing was studied using a cylindrical metal post placed on an array of points across the skin. The polymer fibre grating exhibits approximately 10 times the pressure sensitivity of the <b>silica</b> <b>fibre</b> and responds to the post even when it is placed a few centimetres away from the sensing fibre. Although the intrinsic strain sensitivities of gratings in the two fibre types are very similar, when embedded in the skin the polymer grating displayed a strain sensitivity approximately 45 times greater than the silica device, which also suffered from considerable hysteresis. The polymer grating displayed a near linear response over wavelength shifts of 9 nm for 1 % strain. The difference in behaviour we attribute to the much greater Young’s modulus of the <b>silica</b> <b>fibre</b> (70 GPa) compared to the polymer fibre (3 GPa) ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} for fibre optic based sensing is robust operation in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) region. This is of major interest because this wavelength region is where the characteristic absorption spectra {{for a wide range}} of molecules lie. However, due to the high absorption of silica (above 2 μm), mid-IR sensors based on solid core <b>silica</b> <b>fibres</b> are not practical. Of the many alternatives to solid <b>silica</b> <b>fibres,</b> hollow core microstrutured optical fibres are being explored and show great promise. One relatively new fibre, the hollow core negative curvature fibre (NCF) is promising for novel optical devices due to the simple structure (in comparison to other microstructured fibres) in combination with a hollow core which enables low loss mid-IR infrared guidance in a <b>silica</b> based <b>fibre.</b> In this paper, an all silica NCF that is post-processed with a fs laser, in order to increase access to the hollow core, is presented with acceptable loss and significant potential for mid-IR gas sensing...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: One {{of the key}} {{components}} in all-optical communication networks using the whole low-loss bandwidth of the <b>silica</b> <b>fibre</b> is an ultra-wideband wavelength converter [1]. Use of all-optical ultrawideband wavelength converters enhances network flexibility, allowing an all-optical wavelength conversion between different transmission windows, and therefore avoiding the bottleneck of optical-electricaloptical conversion. This will become of particular importance at the network nodes interfacing metro-access systems employing the whole low-loss bandwidth of the <b>silica</b> <b>fibre,</b> and the core network traditionally centred in a 1550 nm window. A number of metro-access schemes utilising simultaneously 1310 and 1550 nm transmission windows have been proposed, e. g. [2, 3]. Ultra-wideband wavelength converters applied in metro-access systems have to deliver high performance while remaining cost-effective.
