It is important for dietary sustenance, and also retains deep social, cultural and economic significance, playing a fundamental role in maintaining group cohesion, transferring cultural knowledge and affirming Indigenous identities. We surveyed approximately 20 % of the Gumbaynggirr Aboriginal community of Nambucca Heads, New South Wales, Australia. This paper explores Gumbaynggirr Connection to Country and engagement in cultural practice. It quantifies fishing efforts and consumption of seafood within the community. We found 95 % of the sample group fish, with the highest rate of fishing being 2 - 3 times a week (27 %). Furthermore, 98 % of participants eat seafood weekly or more frequently, up to more than once a day (24 %). Survey results revealed that Myxus elongatus (Sand mullet) and naturally recruited Saccostrea glomerata (Sydney rock oysters) continue to be important wild resources to the Gumbaynggirr community. Trace metals were measured in M. elongatus and S. glomerata samples collected by community participants in this study. Maximum levels prescribed in the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code were not exceeded in the edible tissue for either species, however both species exceeded the generally expected levels for zinc and copper and S. glomerata samples exceeded the generally expected level for selenium. Furthermore the average dietary exposure to trace metals from consuming seafood was calculated for the surveyed population. Trace metal intake was then compared to the <b>provisional</b> <b>tolerable</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>intake</b> prescribed by the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives. This process revealed that copper and selenium intake were both within the <b>provisional</b> <b>tolerable</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>intake,</b> while there is no guideline for zinc. Furthermore, participants relying heavily on wild resources from the Nambucca River estuary may exceed the <b>provisional</b> <b>tolerable</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>intake</b> for cadmium.

40|$|The {{contamination}} of our foods with heavy metals has predisposed humans and even animals to heavy metal toxicity {{which is of}} public health importance. These findings have drawn the interest of biochemist, nutritionist, health workers and researchers all over the world. Rice {{is one of the}} most widely consumed staples in Nigeria. This study investigated the concentration of heavy metals in locally produced rice from the South-East and South-South geopolitical zones of Nigeria. A total of ten (10) samples were collected from various locations in the South-East and South-South geopolitical zones and five (5) heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr, Pb and Hg) were analyzed from each samples. The result showed that of Cr and Pb concentrations ranged from 0. 019 - 0. 282 mg/kg and 0. 000 - 1. 722 mg/kg respectively. The average mean for chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) concentrations were 0. 060 and 0. 777 mg/kg respectively. Mercury, chromium and arsenic were below detectable concentration of < 0. 001 mg/kg. To assess the safety of dietary <b>intake,</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>intake</b> of heavy metals contaminated rice, was calculated based on the intake of a typical 60 kg body weight Nigerian.

Exposure to such elements is an important public health issue, so the study described here was performed {{with the aim of}} determining estimated dietary intakes (EDIs) for these metals in Najran area. The As, Cd, Cr, and Pb concentrations in four staple foods (rice, wheat, red meat, and chicken) were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. A food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was completed by 80 study participants. These data were used to estimate dietary intakes of the metals in the four staple foods. The mean As, Cd, Cr, and Pb EDIs in the four food types were 1. 1 × 10 − 6 – 2. 6 × 10 − 5, 1. 42 × 10 − 5 – 2. 2 × 10 − 4, 3. 4 × 10 − 4 – 8. 0 × 10 − 4, and 2. 3 × 10 − 5 – 2. 1 × 10 − 3 mg/kg bw day, respectively. Hazard Quotients (HQ) for all elements did not exceed one. The highest Pb concentration was found for chicken and the source of this toxic element in this food needs to be investigated in the future.

In line with JECFA, the CONTAM Panel established a <b>tolerable</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>intake</b> (TWI) for inorganic mercury of 4 µg/kg b. w., expressed as mercury. For methylmercury, new developments in epidemiological studies from the Seychelles Child Developmental Study Nutrition Cohort have indicated that n- 3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in fish may counteract negative effects from methylmercury exposure. Together with the information that beneficial nutrients in fish may have confounded previous adverse outcomes in child cohort studies from the Faroe Islands, the Panel established a TWI for methylmercury of 1. 3 µg/kg b. w., expressed as mercury. The mean dietary exposure across age groups does not exceed the TWI for methylmercury, with the exception of toddlers and other children in some surveys. The 95 th percentile dietary exposure is close to or above the TWI for all age groups. High fish consumers, which might include pregnant women, may exceed the TWI by up to approximately six-fold. Unborn children constitute the most vulnerable group. Biomonitoring data from blood and hair indicate that methylmercury exposure is generally below the TWI in Europe, but higher levels are also observed. Exposure to methylmercury above the TWI is of concern. If measures to reduce methylmercury exposure are considered, the potential beneficial effects of fish consumption should also be taken into account. Dietary inorganic mercury exposure in Europe does not exceed the TWI, but inhalation exposure of elemental mercury from dental amalgam is likely to increase the internal inorganic mercury exposure; thus the TWI might be exceeded...|$|R

The metal pollution index (MPI) for the two species fluctuated between 0. 9 and 1. 8 in El-Mex and Eastern Harbour. <b>Provisional</b> <b>Tolerable</b> <b>Weekly</b> <b>Intake</b> (PTWI) demonstrates that the {{concentration of}} the metals (Cd, Cu and Pb) in the muscle of Siganus rivulatus and Sargus sargus from El-Mex Bay and Eastern Harbour are {{much lower than the}} PTWI values and accordingly there is no risk for the human consumption of these fish species...|$|E
30|$|Dietary intake is the {{predominant}} exposure pathway to PCDD/Fs and PCBs. For PCDD/Fs, more than 90 % of daily intake {{is due to}} consumption of food from animal origin. For PCBs, indoor dust and air also constitute a significant risk to sensitive subpopulations [37, 38]. Different organisations have undertaken risk assessments of dioxins and dl-PCBs and developed a range of health-based guidance values (HBGV) [39]. In 1998, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a TDI for PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs of 1 – 4  pg toxic equivalents (TEQ)/kg body weight (bw) per day [40]. In 2001, the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) of the EU established a <b>tolerable</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>intake</b> (TWI) of 14  pg TEQ/kg bw per week. This TWI {{is in line with}} the <b>provisional</b> <b>tolerable</b> monthly intake (PTMI) of 70  pg TEQ/kg bw per month set by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) in 2001. For total PCBs, the World Health Organization (WHO) derived a tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 20  ng PCB/kg bw per day in 2003 (WHO) [41]. Currently the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is reassessing the human health risk related to the presence of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs in food. The TWI is being revised and will likely be reduced [42].|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tolerable</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>intake</b> (TWI) {{estimates}} the amount per unit body {{weight of a}} potentially harmful substance or contaminant in food or water that can be ingested over a lifetime without risk of adverse health effects. TWI is generally preceded by [...] "provisional" [...] to indicate insufficient data exists, increasing uncertainty. [...] The term TWI should be reserved for {{when there is a}} well-established and internationally accepted tolerance, backed by sound and uncontested data. Although similar in concept to tolerable daily intake (TDI), which is of the same derivation of acceptable daily intakes (ADIs), TWI accounts for contaminants that do not clear the body quickly and may accumulate within the body over a period of time. [...] An example is heavy metals such as arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury. The concept of TWI takes into account daily variations in human consumption patterns.|$|R
40|$|For {{the risk}} {{characterization}} TWI for cadmium set by EFSA in 2009, ie <b>Tolerable</b> <b>Weekly</b> <b>Intake</b> (TWI) of 2. 5 mg/kg bw for cadmium {{was used as}} an reference dose. Quantitatively set non- carcinogenic risk of dietary exposure to cadmium from infant formulae for average <b>weekly</b> cadmium <b>intake</b> from food infant formulae at average consumption did not exceed a value of one (HI 0. 89), ie the average cadmium intake from infant formulae at average consumption poses no significant risk of adverse toxic effects. Quantitatively set non- carcinogenic risk of dietary exposure to cadmium from infant formulae for average <b>weekly</b> cadmium <b>intake</b> from food infant formulae at high consumption did not exceed a value of one (HI in the range of 1. 34), ie the average cadmium intake from infant formulae at high consumption theoretically represents a potential risk of adverse toxic effects. However, since the analytical results the content of cadmium, expressed for the purpose of risk assessment, in the form of food as sold, and not as consumed (dilution factors are not known), it is probably a overestimation...|$|R
