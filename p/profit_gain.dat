40|$|Integrating the linkage, leverage, and {{learning}} (LLL) model with institutional economics, this paper develops a moderated mediation framework {{to examine the}} relationship between internationalization and the performance of multinational enterprises from latecomer economies (latecomer MNEs). In the framework, whether a latecomer MNE may succeed in learning and knowledge-led <b>profit</b> <b>gains</b> from internationalization is contingent on the development of market-oriented institutions in the country in which it is based. Latecomer MNEs based in countries with a high level of the development of market-oriented institutions are likely to succeed in learning to obtain knowledge-led <b>profit</b> <b>gains</b> from internationalization. Latecomer MNEs based in countries with a low level of the development of market-oriented institutions are likely to experience a breakdown in learning, and a failure in knowledge-led <b>profit</b> <b>gains</b> from internationalization. This paper provides robust evidence on the relationship between internationalization and the performance of latecomer MNEs conditional on the development of market-oriented institutions in their home countries, and discusses strategic implications for latecomer MNE managers...|$|R

In investigating alleged breaches of chapter II a two-stage process is involved. Firstly it must be identified if the firm actually possesses a dominant market position. This can be done through various concentration indices such as the Herfindahl-Hirchman Index (HHI). Generally if a firm is {{found to have a}} market share in excess of 40% then it is considered a threat to competition.|$|E

In order to allow for <b>profit</b> <b>gain</b> and non artist collection, both {{the concept of a}} mutual exchange {{and the name of the}} cards were altered (while the size was kept). In 2004, a first ATCs offshoot was organized on eBay by Lisa Luree (eBay name bone*diva). To circumvent intellectual property rights, she called it [...] "Art Cards, Editions and Originals" [...] (ACEOs). It was the beginning of what an eBay staff member two years later called [...] "eBay's home grown art movement". In 2005, Jillian Crider started the Small Format Art Group on eBay, which allowed for works [...] "no more than 14 inches in any one direction". Whereas ATCs are rather shown in museums and special exhibitions (usually accompanied by a trading session), ACEOs are sold on auction sites, collected privately and reproduced in craft tutorials or other publications.|$|E
50|$|Incremental {{profit is}} the <b>profit</b> <b>gain</b> or loss {{associated}} with a given managerial decision. Total profit increases so long as incremental profit is positive. When incremental profit is negative, total profit declines. Similarly, incremental profit is positive (and total profit increases) if the incremental revenue {{associated with a}} decision exceeds the incremental cost. The incremental concept is so intuitively obvious that {{it is easy to}} overlook both its significance in managerial decision making and the potential for difficulty in correctly applying it.For this reason, the incremental concept is sometimes violated in practice. For example, a firm may refuse to sublet excess warehouse space for $5000 per month because it figures its cost as $7500 per month -a price paid for a long-term lease on the facility. However, if the warehouse space represents excess capacity with no current value to the company, its historical cost of $7500 per month is irrelevant and should be disregarded. The firm would forego $5000 in profits by turning down the offer to sublet the excess warehouse space. Similarly, any firm that adds a standard allocated charge for fixed costs and overhead to the true incremental cost of production runs the risk of turning down profitable business.|$|E

The model builds on the classic framework of the multi-armed Bandit problem by explicitly incorporating two key assumptions. First, switching investments is costly.

The main result is that when the volatility of profits from investments increases, so does the minimum <b>profit</b> <b>gain</b> needed for an investor to switch investments.

We demonstrate that consumer surplus is higher with uniform pricing than with history-based {{price discrimination}}. We find that the entry decision is invariant to whether the incumbent implements history-based pricing or uniform pricing. This implies that the potential abuse of market dominance imposed by history-based price discrimination is exploitation, not exclusion. Finally, we establish that the <b>profit</b> <b>gain</b> to the incumbent from history-based pricing exceeds the associated loss to consumers.

Length–weight regressions have been extensively used to estimate animal weight from length due to the technical constraint in the field (Nie et al. 2014). Fish farmers commonly use fish weight gain to evaluate <b>profit</b> <b>gain</b> and scientists usually adopt length measurements to assess fish growth performance in the field. In selective breeding, LWR is a useful measure for body condition in selected species and to compare morphological differences between populations in different regions (Nie et al. 2013).

40|$|Abstract. Interval pricing {{can provide}} an {{effective}} means of congestion control as well as revenue generation. Using this method, prices are fixed over intervals of time, providing adaptability and predictability. An important issue is the interval duration associated with price updates. While previous research has discussed the effect of interval lengths on congestion control, this paper investigates the economic impact of price interval duration. Smaller intervals yield higher profits since prices are more responsive to changing demands. However, experimental results indicate only a modest <b>profit</b> <b>gain</b> (no more than 5 %) is achieved when smaller intervals are used as opposed to larger intervals (for example 100 times longer). Given users preferences toward fewer price changes, smaller price intervals may hold few economic benefits. ...|$|E
40|$|The gain {{of profits}} in {{accordance}} to the targets, quantity targets and time target is the goal and mission of any company. In gaining profits, the role of leader is very important, especially their role in decision making. According to the theoretical review and empirical findings, {{it is found that}} leaders tend to use rationality in their decision making to gain profit. Yet, it is questioned whether uni-dimensional with rational decision making is still applicable to encourage the acceleration of company’s <b>profit</b> <b>gain</b> in this globalization era? The question comes up because along with the increase of interest in the use intuition in decision making, the theories used as the basis of intuitive decision making have also developed. Thus, for the development of empirical study in the field of decision making or often called as Intuitive Decision Making (IDM), the use of IDM should be further investigated. The research aims to find out the construction of Bank Leaders in the practice of IDM in gaining bank profit and its role to accelerate the creation of bank profit. This is a qualitative research using constructivism approach with interactive data analysis. The subjects of this research consist of 8 participants. The findings of this research support the basic theory called Cognitive Experiential Self Theory (CEST) by Epstein (1996) who states that there is an interaction between IDM and RDM (Rational Decision Making). The role of IDM played by the heads of BRI Bank new branch-offices has been proven to accelerate the <b>profit</b> <b>gain</b> with the appearance of 6 (six) factors which influence that role.
