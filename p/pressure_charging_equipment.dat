40|$|The {{expected}} {{increase in}} the penetration of electric vehicles (EV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) will produce unbalanced conditions, reactive power consumption and current harmonics drawn by the battery <b>charging</b> <b>equipment,</b> causing {{a great impact on}} the power quality of the future smart grid.

This ac on-board <b>charging</b> <b>equipment</b> can operate in grid-to-vehicle (G 2 V) mode, and also in vehicle-to-grid (V 2 G) mode, transferring the battery energy to the grid when the vehicle is parked. The charger is controlled with a Perfect Harmonic Cancellation (PHC) strategy, contributing to improve the grid power quality, since the current demanded or injected has no harmonic content and a high power factor. Hall-effect current and voltage transducers have been used in the sensor stage to carry out this control strategy. Experimental results with a laboratory prototype are presented...|$|R

50|$|Basic <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> is {{fundamental}} for Automatic Performance Control (APC). Basic <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> is mechanically adjusted on the actuators pushrod between the actuator and the waste gate. At to low basic <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> the engine doesn’t revs up as expected when the throttle is opened quickly. At to high basic <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> a negative adaptation occurs and maximum <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> cannot be achieved. In addition {{there is a}} substantial risk of engine damage since the <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> can’t be lowered enough when regulating with attention to pre ignition/pinging. Basic <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> shall be 0,40 ±0,03 bar (5,80 ±0,43 PSI). After adjustment the push rod must have at least two turns (2 mm) pre tension when connecting to the waste gate lever. The purpose with that {{is to make sure that}} the waste gate is held close when not affected. On new turbo chargers the basic <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> tends to be near or spot on the upper tolerance when the pre tension is two turns. The pre tension may never be lesser than two turns (2 mm). When checking the basic <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> it shall be noted that the pressure decreases at high RPM and increases at low outside temperatures.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{expedient}} routes to improving in-vehicle fuel economy {{is to reduce the}} swept volume of an engine and run it at a higher BMEP for any given output. This can be achieved through <b>pressure</b> <b>charging.</b> However, for maximum fuel economy, particularly at part-load, the compression ratio (CR) should be kept as high as possible. This is at odds with the requirement in <b>pressure</b> <b>charged</b> engines to reduce the CR at higher loads due to the knock limit. Lotus has studied a <b>pressure</b> <b>charging</b> system which will allow a high compression ratio to be maintained at all times. This is achieved by deliberately over compressing the charge air, intercooling it at the resulting elevated pressure, and then expanding it, via a turbine, to the desired plenum boost pressure, ensuring a plenum temperature which can potentially become sub-ambient at full-load. Due to its high CR, it is possible that an engine fitted with such a charging system could therefore achieve fuel consumption equal to or better than a Variable Compression Ratio unit, while permitting conventional engine architecture and assembly lines. This paper analyses the likely performance of an engine fitted with such a charging system, and presents details of rig tests and results of performance modelling conducted to investigate one potential layout, and discusses the 'Nomad' engine project, which is intended, amongst other things, to prove the ability of a turboexpansion system to facilitate aggressive engine downsizing...|$|R

Therefore, {{the efficiency of}} CPT needs to be optimized. In this paper, PSSS (primary side series compensation and secondary side series compensation) model is used to study the efficiency optimization of a high-power CPT. The factors such as coil structure, resonant frequency, and load matching on high-power CPT <b>charging</b> <b>equipment</b> are studied by simulation and experiment. The results show that system efficiency is proportional to mutual inductance values; coil structure mainly affects the mutual inductance values; the mutual inductance of the coils is mainly affected by {{the diameter of the}} coils, the distance between the coils, the shape of coil, the number of turns, and so forth. As for the CPT charging system based on full-bridge inverter circuit, the efficiency of the system increases as the frequency increases in the range of 0 – 50 kHz, while decreases as the frequency is higher than 50 kHz. Load matching also affects the efficiency of high-power CPT <b>charging</b> <b>equipment,</b> and the load matching formula based on an equivalent circuit model is given...|$|R
