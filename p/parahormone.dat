40|$|Vitamin D 3 {{has been}} {{described}} to have different extraskeletal roles by acting as <b>parahormone</b> in obesity, diabetes, cancer, cognitive impairment, and dementia and to have important regulatory functions in innate immunity. There are no studies showing extraskeletal changes associated with hypovitaminosis D 3 in eating disorders. Methods. We have analyzed the blood of 18 patients affected by anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa collected over a 15 -month period. We performed a panel of chemical and clinical analyses: the assay of vitamin D 3, the immunoblotting of vitamin D receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, and the genotyping of 5 -hydroxytryptamine transporter linked polymorphic region. Results. We choose 18 patients with a normal blood test profile such as thyroid hormones, hepatic and renal parameters, triglycerides, proteins, vitamin B 12, and folic acid. Among these emerged {{the case of a}} woman with long-term anorexia nervosa and the case of a woman with long-term bulimia nervosa both complicated by anxiety and depression, severe hypovitaminosis D 3, decrease of vitamin D receptor, leukopenia, and 5 -hydroxytryptamine transporter linked polymorphic region short allele. Conclusion. The results induce hypothesising that the severe hypovitaminosis D 3 might be responsible for the lack of the inflammatory response and the depressive symptoms in patients with long-term eating disorder...|$|E
40|$|To {{consider}} {{the relationship of}} serum magnesium with {{the activity of the}} parathyroid gland in maintenance hemodialysis patients we designed a study to investigate the role of serum magnesium in regulating the parathyroid secretion. The study was conducted on patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis treatment. Predialysis serum calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, intact serum PTH (iPTH), serum 25 -hydroxy vitamin D (25 -OH Vit D) and plasma HCO 3 – were measured. The Urea Reduction Rate, duration and dosage of hemodialysis treatment were calculated also. In this study no significant correlation of serum magnesium with duration of hemodialysis treatment, alkaline phosphatase, plasma HCO 3 –, serum calcium and phosphorus patients were seen. In all patients a near significant inverse correlation of serum magnesium with iPTH (r = - 0. 30, p = 0. 079) was found, also a significant positive correlation of serum magnesium with serum 25 -hydroxy vitamin D levels (r = 0. 40, p = 0. 009) was seen. Earlier research concluded that some factors other than serum magnesium may be more important in the regulation of <b>parahormone</b> secretion in hemodialysis patients. A positive and strong association between serum magnesium with 25 -hydroxy vitamin D level, needs to more attention to this aspect of hemodialysis patients...|$|E
40|$|AIMS—To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that a vitamin D dose of 200 IU/kg, maximum 400 IU/day, given to preterm infants will maintain normal vitamin D status and will result in as high a bone mineral density as that attained with the recommended dose of 960 IU/day.  METHODS—Thirty nine infants of fewer than 33 weeks of gestational age were randomly allocated to receive vitamin D 200 IU/kg of body weight/day up {{to a maximum of}} 400 IU/day or 960 IU/day until 3 months old. Vitamin D metabolites, bone mineral content and density were determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, and plasma ionised calcium, plasma alkaline phosphatase, and intact <b>parahormone</b> measurements were used to evaluate outcomes.  RESULTS—The 25 hydroxy vitamin D concentrations tended to be higher in infants receiving 960 IU/day, but the differences did not reach significance at any age. There was no difference between the infants receiving low or high vitamin D dose in bone mineral content nor in bone mineral density at 3 and 6 months corrected age, even after taking potential risk factors into account.  CONCLUSIONS—A vitamin D dose of 200 IU/kg of body weight/day up to a maximum of 400 IU/day maintains normal vitamin D status and as good a bone mineral accretion as the previously recommended higher dose of 960 IU/day. Vitamin D is a potent hormone which affects organs other than bone and should not be given in excess to preterm infants. ...|$|E
