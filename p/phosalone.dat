The results from gas production showed that cumulative gas production for 96 h after incubation significantly decreased with increasing the levels of <b>phosalone</b> and lowest gas production for this time was observed at 1000 ppm of <b>phosalone.</b> Increasing <b>phosalone</b> in the culture was accompanied with deceasing DM degradability and NH 3 -N and differences between treatments were statistically significant, so that <b>phosalone</b> at 1000 ppm and control groups had lowest and highest NH 3 -N respectively. With increasing of <b>phosalone</b> at different levels to the medium, pH remained constant during the 24 h incubation, but with increasing the levels of bentonite (specially the 2 percent level), the pH relatively increased. The results of this experiment showed that some of fermentation parameters (such as cumulative gas production at different incubation times, NH 3 -N and DM degradability) decreased by increasing <b>phosalone</b> in culture media (0 to 1000 ppm). Supplementation of bentonite rather {{than the control group}} with no pesticide resulted to decreasing of the gas production at 96 h incubation. In coordination with these results, generally supplementation of bentonite (especially at 2 % of DM) to different level of <b>phosalone</b> also resulted to decreasing of the cumulative gas production in different times of incubation. There was no significant effect for DM degradability by adding the bentonite to culture media between treatments, although only by adding the bentonite at 1000 ppm <b>phosalone,</b> DM degradability increased...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Transfer of {{pesticides}} from environment to animal products is inevitable, so {{the purpose of}} the present work was to evaluate <b>phosalone</b> consumption via feeding with or without sodium bentonite (SB) on performance, blood metabolites and its transition to milk of Iranian Baluchi sheep. Methods Twenty Baluchi ewes were divided into four treatments (P 1 as control, P 2, P 3, and P 4) of five animals in which <b>phosalone,</b> an organophosphate pesticide, was given via diet (only for P 2 and P 3) at a dose of 280  mg/sheep/day for 63 consecutive days. The SB (32  g/sheep/day; for P 3 and P 4) was also evaluated for its ability to reduce deleterious effects of <b>phosalone</b> in the sheep diets. The control group (P 1) did not receive any <b>phosalone</b> and SB during the experiment. Sampling was conducted in two periods of time including weeks 5 and 9. Results <b>Phosalone</b> residues were observed in the milk samples of P 2 and P 3 groups during two sampling periods. During period 1, the transfer rate of <b>phosalone</b> from feed to milk was 0. 23 and 0. 02 %, respectively for the contaminated diets (P 2 and P 3), which is relatively similar to period 2 (0. 22 and 0. 02 %). Only 0. 34 (period 1) and 0. 36 % (period 2) of <b>phosalone</b> residue are excreted in the feces of P 2 group following its daily consumption. Transfer of <b>phosalone</b> from feed to milk was affected (P    0. 05) on the dry matter intake (DMI) and body weight (BW) gain, but feed efficiency, milk production, milk fat, dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM) digestibility, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity, hemoglobin (Hb), red blood cell (RBC), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), albumin and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) affected by the treatments in period 1 or 2 (P <  0. 05). The Hb, RBC, and MCHC were significantly decreased (P <  0. 05) by about 9. 72, 20. 77, and 9. 71 %, respectively in the group P 2 as compared to those of the control group during period 1. The AChE inhibitory activity (period 1 and 2) significantly increased when <b>phosalone</b> administered via the diet (P <  0. 05). Conclusions Although there were no adverse effects on the performance of sheep following the intake of <b>phosalone</b> alone (P 2 vs. P 1), but other research on the long and short times to the <b>phosalone</b> in high and low doses with more animals is suggested. Overall, compared to the control group, addition of SB in the diet of sheep improved nutrient digestibility, animal performance, and milk health...|$|E
40|$|The {{fate of the}} {{residues}} of benalaxyl, dimethoate, iprodione, metalaxyl, <b>phosalone,</b> procymidone, and vinclozolin {{in sunlight}} and oven raisin processing was studied. The drying process caused a fruit concentration factor of 4, while the decreases in residue with the two drying processes were different for the different pesticides. In sunlight-drying the residue level in the raisins was identical {{to that in the}} fresh fruits for benalaxyl, metalaxyl, and <b>phosalone,</b> whereas it was higher for iprodione (1. 6) and lower for vinclozolin and dimethoate (one-third and one-fifth, respectively). The oven-drying process was preceded by washing, which caused residue decreases for iprodione and procymidone of 57 and 41 %, respectively, whereas no decrease was observed in all of the other pesticides. During oven-drying pesticide residues in raisins with respect to fresh fruits showed an increase of 2. 7 for <b>phosalone,</b> the same values for benalaxyl, metalaxyl, and procymidone, and lower values for vinclozolin and dimethoate. Sunlight-drying was more effective for <b>phosalone</b> and vinclozolin, whereas oven-drying was more effective for iprodione and procymidone, which was due to the washing effect rather than to dehydration. The experiments carried out with a model system showed that the decrease in dimethoate is attributable to heat, whereas in benalaxyl, procymidone, and <b>phosalone</b> it is due to codistillation and in iprodione and metalaxyl to the combined action of heat and codistillation...|$|E

40|$|An illness {{characterized}} by weakness, dizziness, and gastrointestinal symtoms was identified among {{a crew of}} 30 migrant field-workers employed by a grape grower in Madera County, California, during August 1987. The onset of symptoms occurred between August 24 and August 30 and a median of 9 days from the date of first employment. The first crew member sought medical treatment on August 26, and 10 crew members were admitted to hospital between August 27 and August 30. For most workers, gastrointestinal and constitutional symptoms resolved shortly after admission, but 4 patients had episodes of severe sinus bradycardia persisting for several days. On the day of admission, transient atrioventricular dissociation developed in 2 persons. Interviews with 16 crew members not {{admitted to the hospital}} identified only 1 additional worker ill with gastrointestinal symptoms, but all 16 had moderate to severe inhibition of both plasma and red blood cell cholinesterase. Four other workers who were tested but not interviewed also had cholinesterase depression.

40|$|The {{honey bee}} is {{credited}} with approximately 85 % of the pollinating activity necessary to supply {{about one-third of the}} world’s food supply. Well over 50 major crops depend on these insects for pollination. The crops produce more abundantly when honey bees are plentiful. Worker bees are the ones primarily affected by pesticides. Poisoning symptoms can vary depending on the developmental stage of the individual bee, and the kind of chemical employed. The oral toxicity of these insecticides: (<b>phosalone</b> and pirimicarb), acaricide (propargite), insecticide and acaricide (fenpropathrin), fungicides, and bactericides (copper oxychloride and the Bordeaux mixture), were evaluated {{for the purposes of this}} research. The results showed that fenpropathrin had high acute oral toxicity (LC 50 - 24 h and LC 50 - 48 were 0. 54 and 0. 3 ppm, respectively). Propargite had 7785 ppm (active ingredient) for LC 50 - 24 h and 6736 ppm (active ingredient) for LC 50 - 48 h in honeybees and is therefore, non-toxic to Apis mellifera. On the other hand, copper oxychloride had minimum acute oral toxicity to honeybees (LC 50 - 24 h and LC 50 - 48 were 4591. 5 and 5407. 9 ppm, respectively) and was therefore considered non-toxic.

40|$|Although the {{chemical}} {{composition of soil}} organic matter (SOM) is known to significantly influence sorption of pesticides and other pollutants, it {{has been difficult to}} determine the molecular nature of SOM in situ. Here, using 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data and elemental composition in a molecular mixing model, we estimated the molecular components of SOM in 24 soils from various agro-ecological regions. Substantial variations were revealed in the molecular nature of SOM. As a proportion of soil carbon the proportion of the carbonyl component ranged from 0. 006 to 0. 05, charcoal from 0 to 0. 15, protein from 0. 09 to 0. 29, aliphatic from 0. 14 to 0. 30, carbohydrate from 0. 21 to 0. 31, and lignin from 0. 05 to 0. 42.

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Levels of {{resistance}} to six selected insecticides of eleven field populations of the filbert aphid Mvzocallis coryli (Goetze) were determined by using the leaf-dip residue technique. Test insecticides included compounds widely used in commercial filbert orchards, namely, carbaryl, diazinon, endosulfan, <b>phosalone,</b> fenvalerate and oxydemetonmethyl. Aphid samples were collected within a 100 -mile range from Eugene {{in the south to}} Wilsonville in the north of the Willamette Valley, Oregon. The filbert orchards were characterized by different levels of insecticide exposure, age and management conditions. The tests were conducted to detect seasonality {{of resistance}} during the different phases of the population in the summer, fall and early spring months of 1985 - 1986. Toxicological responses of various filbert aphid populations exhibited significantly different resistance to tested insecticides. All populations exhibited lethal concentration (Lc₅₀) values of 0. 0013 g AI/ 1 to 0. 1507 g AI/ 1 of endosulfan which, when compared to the susceptible OSU population, were categorized as zero to moderate levels of resistance. With the exception of a high Lc₅₀ value of 1. 7853 g AI/ 1 exhibited by the Harnisch population, resistance to diazinon is still at low levels or non existent in most populations of M. coryli in the Willamette Valley. Lc₅₀ values of carbaryl varied from 0. 0075 g AI/ 1 to more than 1. 2 g AI/ 1, indicating significant differences in tolerance among the filbert aphid populations to this insecticide. The majority of the populations were moderately resistant, but extremely high levels (> 1000 -fold) of resistance were evident in populations collected from two orchards. Lc₅₀ values for these populations were well above the maximum range of recommended field dosages. Highest resistance levels of more than 1000 -fold of fenvalerate also were noticed in filbert aphid populations from these orchards; Lc₅₀'s were more than the maximum field rate. Populations of M. coryli from other orchards were non-resistant (Lc₅₀ value of 0. 0003 g AI/ 1) to highly resistant (Lc₅₀ value of 0. 0989 g AI/ 1) to fenvalerate. Selection for high resistance to fenvalerate after just a few seasons of use in commercial orchards was not expected. Although failure of field control of filbert aphids by <b>phosalone</b> has not been reported, several populations have developed high resistance to this insecticide. Filbert aphid populations from three orchards had Lc₅₀'s above the maximum recomended field dosage of 0. 563 g AI/ 1 of <b>phosalone.</b> The maximum Lc₅₀ values {{for the rest of the}} populations ranged from 0. 0012 g AI/ 1 to 0. 2499 g AI/ 1 and were categorized respectively, as non-resistant to highly resistant strains. From one series of experiments in early spring of 1986, the majority of filbert aphid populations indicated zero to moderate levels {{of resistance to}} oxydemetonmethyl. One population with Lc₅₀ value of 0. 2135 g AI/ 1 showed the highest tolerance to this insecticide. The shallow slopes of the log dosage mortality curves indicated heterogeneity of responses of the various filbert aphid populations to the insecticides. These responses could be explained by the widespread use and rotational spraying patterns of the insecticides in commercial orchards. The distribution of resistance was not a regional phenomenon. It was associated with, 1) the pattern of insecticide usage and 2) the proximity of the source of aphid population to more intensively managed commercial orchards. The tendency for increased resistance to all insecticides in summer and fall populations of M. coryli was evident. However, as an exception, <b>phosalone</b> resistance of Lemert population was also high when treated in early spring. Seasonal variations in susceptibility of less than 10 -fold to endosulfan, and 237 -fold to diazinon were measured. Extrapolation of Lc₅₀ values beyond the range of tested concentrations resulted in variations in tolerance of more than 1000 -fold among some populations treated with carbaryl, <b>phosalone</b> and fenvalerate. Several factors which may influence the widespread expression and the seasonality of insecticide resistance have been discussed without giving a generalized explanation. Rather than considering these results quantitatively, what is vital from the present studies is the information on changes in susceptibility of M. coryli to those insecticides recommended to filbert growers in this area. Resistance monitoring is considered critical to effective insect control programs in commercial filbert orchards of the Willamette Valley, Oregon...|$|E

Using a worstcase scenario approach, secondary exposure to three organophosphorus insecticides, (phosmet, azinphosmethyl and <b>phosalone),</b> two anticoagulant rodenticides, (chlorophacinone and diphacinone), and residues of previously applied organochlorines, particularly DDT and metabolites, was assessed. Exposure to PCBs and trace metals was also considered. Small mammal species preyed upon by Screech-owls were captured in orchards for residue analysis on a continual basis for persistent compounds or after insecticide and rodenticide applications. Beginning {{in the winter of}} 2000, 98 nest boxes were constructed and installed in woods inhabited by Screech-owls, adjacent to orchards. These boxes were then repeatedly inspected for pellets and prey remains. Estimated exposure of Screech-owls 0 - 60 hr post-application was 0. 641 mg/kg for phosmet and azinphosmethyl and 0. 401 mg/kg for <b>phosalone.</b> Exposure to phosmet at this level may warrant concern. The acute poison zinc phosphide is now the primary means of small mammal control in the study area and the possibility of exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides is diminishing.

40|$|Background: The {{current study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the effects of <b>phosalone</b> (PLN) as an organophosphate (OP) compound on testicular tissue, hormonal alterations and embryo development in rats. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, we divided 18 mature Wistar rats into three groups-control, control-sham and test (n= 6 per group). Animals in the test group received one-fourth the lethal dose (LD 50) of PLN (150 mg/kg), orally, once per day for 45 days. DNA laddering and epi-fluorescent analyses were performed to evaluate testicular DNA fragmentation and RNA damage, respectively. Serum levels of testosterone and inhibin-B (IN-B) were evaluated. Testicular levels of total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total thiol molecules (TTM) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) were analyzed. Finally, we estimated sperm parameters and effect of PLN on embryo development. Two-way ANOVA was used for statistical analyses. Results: There was severe DNA fragmentation and RNA damage in testicular tissu...|$|E
