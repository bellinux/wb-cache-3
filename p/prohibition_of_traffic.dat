The spread of influenza {{in the suburbs of}} Tokyo should be studied, including the role of commuters and the effect of government policies on the spread of disease. We analyzed the simulated spread of influenza in commuter towns along a suburban railroad, using the individual-based Monte Carlo method, and validated this analysis using surveillance data of the infection in the Tokyo suburbs. This simulation reflects the mechanism of the real spread of influenza in commuter towns. Three measures against the spread of influenza were analyzed: <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic,</b> school closure, and vaccination of school children. <b>Prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> was not effective after the introduction of influenza into the commuter towns, but, if implemented early, it was somewhat effective in delaying the epidemic. School closure delayed the epidemic and reduced the peak of the disease, but it was not as effective in decreasing the number of infected people.

40|$|Human {{trafficking}} is globally {{recognized as}} a modern day slavery with multifarious negative socio-economic, legal and health implications. Besides drugs trafficking and gun running, human trafficking has become a lucrative business globally and yields an estimated US$ 32 million annually. Traffickers trade on human lives, subject them to gory and traumatic experiences {{in order to make}} profits. Human trafficking is therefore the worst form of human rights violations and a gender based violence against female who constitute the majority of the victims in the country. Regrettably, Nigeria occupies the ignoble position of a source, transit and destination country for trafficking. In the recent time, the scourge has assumed complex dimensions, become more elusive, shrouded in secrecy and with the attendant consequences and implications on the live of the country. Data from the National Agency for the <b>Prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>Traffic</b> in Persons and other related matters, (NAPTIP) show that seventy eight percent of victims of human trafficking in Nigeria fall within the age range, 8 - 27 years. Children within this age bracket are naturally of school going age. Victims of trafficking miss educational opportunities needed for today’s globalized world. This paper discussed the dynamics of human trafficking in Nigeria, some emerging trends in trafficking, the socio-economic implications, government’s strategies in curbing the menace and possible adoption as good practice.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} human rights violation,societal abuse and the {{language}} used in perpetrating these vices in Cross River State, Nigeria. Human rights in the state are particularly violated through child-trafficking, child-abuse, spousal rights and rights in the work-place. Child-trafficking is rampant in certain Local Government Areas (LGA) of the state, such as Yakurr and Calabar South. Although {{this is also a}} form of child-abuse it was discovered that the latter is highlighted in the home where children are used for labour and invariably denied access to education. Spousal rights are also reflected in the home where the wife is subjected to a ‘policy ’ of lack of freedom to a job, further education etc by her husband. It was also observed that corruption was a harbinger of human rights violation, particularly in the civil service. Language use in persuasion and coercion {{play an important role in}} how successful these violations are carried out. However, government through its agencies, such as the National Agency for the <b>Prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>Traffic</b> in Persons and Other Related Matters (NAPTIP) has been active to some extent in curbing these violations. It is hoped that this paper, will help to galvanize further action and interactions on the subject of human rights in Cross River State in particular and Nigeria in general...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to conduct an {{analysis}} of international law in relation to trafficking in women and children, {{from the perspective of}} various sources of law as well as various approaches used to deal with the issue. The question of the existence of a rule on the level of international customary law consisting in the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>trafficking</b> in women and children is especially significant. The problem <b>of</b> <b>trafficking</b> in women and children is a multi- dimensional issue encompassing more subsystems of international law, which gives rise to a question of the relation of the respective subsystems. The human rights law and criminal law approach complement each other in international legal instruments which deal with trafficking in women and children when their deficiencies are compensated for by the strengths of the other subsystem. The thesis is divided into two parts. The first part presents the introduction into the problem <b>of</b> <b>trafficking</b> in women and children. This part explains the relation between the analysed problem and related phenomenon, clarifies key words used in the thesis, defines actors engaged in the process <b>of</b> <b>trafficking</b> in women and children and finally deals with factors which exercise influence on the enormous rise <b>of</b> <b>trafficking</b> in women and children in the present-day [...] ...|$|R

Moreover, cross-border commercial work also resorted to re-instating child trafficking for sex. A Nigerian envoy in Côte d'Ivoire noted the frequency of adolescent girls among Nigerian commercial workers in Abidjan. Within the country, {{the most common form}} of sex work is found within brothels or residences of sex workers but then a steady rise in young students and unemployed graduates who use sex to earn income and acting as part-time prostitutes or call girls or sometimes called Aristo girls in changing the strategies used by sex workers.

In some cases, porters or hotel staff acts as pimps and links between upper class Nigerians and the call girls. The aristo girls mostly serve upper class citizens and foreigners are better paid than the sex workers in brothels. Almost two thirds of brothel and street sex workers are traders, bar girls, hair dressers or have a second type of job. Brothels are in virtually every major city in the country and offer the cheapest form of service. [...] The brothels are located in highly populated districts and slums within the city.

That it is neither right nor politic for the Government to afford legal protection and sanction to any traffic or system that tends to increase crime, to waste {{the resources of the}} Dominion, to corrupt the social habits, and to destroy the healths and lives of the people."2. That the traffic in intoxicating liquors as common beverages is inimical to the true interests of individuals, and destructive of the order and welfare of society, and ought therefore to be prohibited."3. That the history and results of all legislation in regard to the liquor traffic abundantly prove, that it is impossible satisfactorily to limit or regulate a system so essentially mischievous in its tendencies."4. That no consideration of private gain or public revenue can justify the upholding <b>of</b> a <b>traffic</b> so thoroughly wrong in principle, so suicidal in policy, and disastrous in its results, as the traffic in intoxicating liquors."5. That the Legislative <b>Prohibition</b> <b>of</b> the liquor <b>traffic</b> is perfectly compatible with national liberty, and with the claims of justice and legitimate commerce."6. That the Legislative <b>Prohibition</b> <b>of</b> the liquor <b>traffic</b> would be highly conducive to the development of progressive civilization."7. That rising above sectarian and party considerations, all good citizens should combine to procure an enactment prohibiting the manufacture and sale of intoxicating beverages, as affording the most efficient aid in removing the appalling evils of intemperance.""There may be differences of opinion in regard to the foregoing particulars, but the Council assures the Christian Body it has now the honor to approach, that the utmost diligence has been exercised in the examination of evidence on all the subjects embraced therein."Deeply convinced {{of the value of the}} aid of Christian Ministers and Churches, as such, we solicit your co-operation in the efforts now being made to concentrate the moral and religious energies of the Dominion against the liquor traffic."Your memorialists most earnestly hope that your counsels may be wisely directed, and that you will take such action in the premises as may strengthen the hands and encourage the hearts of those who have the direction of the Prohibitory Liquor Law movement." ...|$|R
