40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} if hypersensitivity {{is present}} in elders with pain. Chronic headache {{was used as a}} model of chronic pain and mechanical and thermal <b>pain</b> <b>thresholds</b> were measured. Methods: Ninety-three people with headache and 44 control individuals participated in the study. Headache patients completed a headache questionnaire. Pressure <b>pain</b> <b>thresholds</b> were measured over the forehead, upper neck, and at a remote site (tibialis anterior). Heat and cold <b>pain</b> <b>thresholds</b> were measured over the upper neck. Results: In the headache group, 26 had headaches classifiable as migraine, 10 with tension-type, 24 with cervicogenic, and 33 headaches were unclassifiable. There {{were no significant differences between}} the headache groups and controls in pressure and cold <b>pain</b> <b>thresholds</b> (all P> 0. 05). Heat <b>pain</b> <b>thresholds</b> were significantly lower in the headache groups (all P 0. 05). No strong relationships were found between any headache variables and <b>pain</b> <b>thresholds.</b> Discussion: Central hyperexcitability does not seem to be a feature of elders with headache. This may be as a consequence of age-related changes in the sensory system but could also be related to the nature of the stimulus provided. Further research in this area is required to better understand pain processing in elders. No Full Tex...|$|R

25|$|Thermal nociceptors are {{activated}} by noxious heat or cold at various temperatures. There are specific nociceptor transducers {{that are responsible}} for how and if the specific nerve ending responds to the thermal stimulus. The first to be discovered was TRPV1, and it has a threshold that coincides with the heat pain temperature of 42°C. Other temperature in the warm–hot range is mediated by more than one TRP channel. Each of these channels express a particular C-terminal domain that corresponds to the warm–hot sensitivity. The interactions between all these channels and how the temperature level is determined to be above the <b>pain</b> <b>threshold</b> are unknown at this time. The cool stimuli are sensed by TRPM8 channels. Its C-terminal domain differs from the heat sensitive TRPs. Although this channel corresponds to cool stimuli, it is still unknown whether it also contributes in the detection of intense cold. An interesting finding related to cold stimuli is that tactile sensibility and motor function deteriorate while pain perception persists.|$|E
25|$|Active {{treatments}} are light repetitive exercises that work {{the area to}} maintain normality. Basic information is also given to teach the patient that exercises as instructed will not cause any damage to their neck. These exercises are done at home or {{under the care of}} a health professional. When beginning a rehabilitation regimen, it's important to begin with slow movements which include cervical rotation until <b>pain</b> <b>threshold</b> three to five times per day, flexion and extension of the shoulder joint by moving the arms up and down two to three times, and combining shoulder raises while inhaling and releasing the shoulder raise while exhaling. Soderlund and colleagues also recommend that these exercises should be done every day until pain starts to dissipate. Early mobilization is important for preventing chronic pain, but pain experienced from these exercises might cause psychological symptoms that could have negative impact on recovery.

25|$|The {{severity}} of symptoms of idic(15) vary greatly between individuals. Individuals with idic(15) usually have delays in language development and motor {{skills such as}} walking or sitting up. Other traits may include low muscle tone (hypotonia), seizures (>50%), short stature, and intellectual disability. Distinctive facial features associated with idic(15), where present, are usually very subtle but may include epicanthal folds (skin folds at the inner corners of one or both eyes), broad forehead, a flattened nasal bridge, button nose, and a high arched palate (roof of the mouth). Many individuals with idic(15) display features of autism, such as problems with communication and social interactions, obsessional interests (often with interactive mechanisms like wheels, doors or switches), unpredictable sleep cycles (and a reduced need for sleep), and repetitive and stereotyped behaviors (e.g., lining up toys, playing with a toy {{in the same manner}} over and over again, hand flapping, rocking back and forth). A high <b>pain</b> <b>threshold</b> is often observed. If speech develops, it is often echolalic but some individuals do grasp some language. With a severely affected person there may be an inability to walk or talk.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to {{evaluate}} bilaterally warm/cold detection and heat/cold <b>pain</b> <b>thresholds</b> over the hand/wrist in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). A total of 25 women with strictly unilateral CTS (mean 42 +/- 10 years), and 20 healthy matched women (mean 41 +/- 8 years) were recruited. Warm/cold detection and heat/cold <b>pain</b> <b>thresholds</b> were assessed bilaterally over the carpal tunnel and the thenar eminence in a blinded design. Self-reported measures included both clinical pain history (intensity, location and area) and Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire. No significant differences between groups for both warm and cold detection thresholds in either carpal tunnel or thenar eminence (P > 0. 5) were found. Further, significant differences between groups, but not between sides, for both heat and cold <b>pain</b> <b>thresholds</b> in both the carpal tunnel and thenar eminence were found (all P < 0. 001). Heat <b>pain</b> <b>thresholds</b> (P < 0. 01) were negatively correlated, whereas cold <b>pain</b> <b>thresholds</b> (P < 0. 001) were positively correlated with hand pain intensity and duration of symptoms. Our findings revealed bilateral thermal hyperalgesia (lower heat pain and reduced cold <b>pain</b> <b>thresholds)</b> but not hypoesthesia (normal warm/cold detection thresholds) in patients with strictly unilateral CTS when compared to controls. We suggest that bilateral heat and cold hyperalgesia may reflect impairments in central nociceptive processing in patients with unilateral CTS. The bilateral thermal hyperalgesia associated with pain intensity and duration of pain history supports a role of generalized sensitization mechanisms in the initiation, maintenance and spread of pain in CTS...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose. Palpation of {{peripheral}} nerve trunks has been advocated {{as a method}} of assessing the presence of hyperalgesic nerve tissue as a contributing factor to pain syndromes in musculoskeletal disorders of the upper quadrant. This study investigated, in the first instance, the pressure <b>pain</b> <b>thresholds</b> of the median, radial and ulnar nerve trunks of the upper limb in healthy, asymptomatic subjects. Method. Forty-five male and 50 female healthy volunteer subjects participated in this study which involved measurement of pressure <b>pain</b> <b>thresholds</b> by use of pressure algometry bilaterally over the three {{peripheral nerve}} trunks in the upper limbs. Results. Pressure <b>pain</b> <b>thresholds</b> were shown to be lowest in the median nerve (p= 0. 001) and lower in female subjects (p= 0. 001).

25|$|The vanilloid {{receptor}} (VR-1, TRPV1) is a receptor that {{is found}} on the free nerve endings of both C and Aδ fibers that responds to elevated levels of heat (>43nbsp&°C) and the chemical capsaicin. Capsaicin activates C fibers by opening a ligand-gated ion channel and causing an action potential to occur. Because this receptor responds to both capsaicin and heat, chili peppers are sensed as hot. VR-1 is also {{able to respond to}} extracellular acidification and can integrate simultaneous exposure to all three sensory stimuli. VR1 is essential for the inflammatory sensitization to noxious thermal stimuli. A second type of receptor, a vanilloid-like receptor (TRPV2,VRL-1), has a higher threshold of activation regarding heat of about 52nbsp&°C and also responds to capsaicin and low pH. Both types of receptors are transmembrane receptors that are closed during resting conditions. When open, these receptors allow for an influx of sodium and calcium which initiates an action potential across the fibers. Both receptors are part of a larger family of receptors called transient receptor potential (TRP) receptors. If damage to these heat transducer receptors occurs, the result can be chronic neuropathic pain caused by lowering the heat <b>pain</b> <b>threshold</b> for their phosphorylation.|$|E

Contrasting effects of exercise on the amplitude of laser evoked potentials (14. 6 % decrease, d = - 0. 42, p = 0. 004) and somatosensory evoked potentials (10. 9 % increase, d = - 0. 02, p = 1. 72) were also observed, while an equivalent period of rest showed similar habituation (laser evoked potential: 7. 3 % decrease, d = - 0. 25, p = 0. 14; somatosensory evoked potential: 20. 7 % decrease, d = - 0. 32, p = 0. 006). The differential response of pressure <b>pain</b> <b>thresholds</b> and heat <b>pain</b> <b>thresholds</b> to exercise is consistent with relative insensitivity of thermal nociception to the acute hypoalgesic effects of exercise.
