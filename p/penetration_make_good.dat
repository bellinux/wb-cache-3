30|$|Intravitreal {{administration}} of clindamycin has advantages over classic therapy {{due to its}} reduced side effect profile. Intravitreal injections of clindamycin deliver {{a high concentration of}} the medicine to the intraocular tissues while reducing systemic absorption and unwanted systemic side effects. Additionally, the clindamycin’s <b>good</b> intracellular <b>penetration</b> <b>makes</b> it a <b>good</b> antimicrobial choice for the intracellular T. gondii. Several studies have shown clindamycin to be non-toxic to the retina [3]. Nevertheless, the risks of an intravitreal injection itself do remain including endophthalmitis and retinal detachment [7, 8]. Furthermore, intravitreal clindamycin will only treat the ophthalmic disease, but it will not treat nor prevent systemic reactivation of toxoplasmosis.|$|R
