5|$|The {{visual effects}} for Doomsday {{stemmed from the}} 1980s stunt-based films, {{involving}} approximately 275 visual effects shots. While filmmakers did not seek innovative visual effects, they worked with budget restrictions by creating set extensions. With most shots taking place in daylight, the extensions involved matte paint and 2D and 3D solutions. The visual effects crew visited Scotland to take reference photos so scenes that were filmed in Cape Town, South Africa could instead have Scottish backgrounds. Several challenges for the visual effects crew included the illustration of cow overpopulation in line with a decimated human population and the convincing creation of the rebuilt Hadrian Wall in different lights and from different distances. The most challenging visual effects shot in Doomsday was the close-up in which a main character is burned alive. The shot required multiple enhancements and implementations of burning wardrobe, burning <b>pigskin,</b> and smoke and fire elements to look authentic.|$|E
25|$|Most bite mark {{analysis}} studies use porcine skin (<b>pigskin),</b> {{because it}} {{is comparable to the}} skin of a human, and it is considered unethical to bite a human for study in the United States. Limitations to the bite mark studies include differences in properties of <b>pigskin</b> compared to human skin and the technique of using simulated pressures to create bite marks. Although similar histologically, <b>pigskin</b> and human skin behave in dynamically different ways due to differences in elasticity. Furthermore, postmortem bites on nonhuman skin, such as those used in the experiments of Martin-de-las Heras et al., display different patterns to those seen in antemortem bite injuries. In recognition of the limitations of their study, Kouble and Craig suggest using a G-clamp on an articulator in future studies to standardize the amount of pressure used to produce experimental bite marks instead of applying manual pressure to models on <b>pigskin.</b> Future research and technological developments may help reduce the occurrence of such limitations.|$|E

A suit was constructed for a BBC documentary using <b>pigskin</b> treated with fish oil to repel water. The head was covered by a helmet with two eyeglasses at the front. A breathing tube of bamboo with <b>pigskin</b> joints was attached to the back of the helmet and connected to a float of cork and wood. When the scuba divers tested the suit, they found it to be a workable precursor to a modern diving suit, the cork float acting as a compressed air chamber when submerged.|$|E

5000|$|Moe Howard {{once called}} Three Little <b>Pigskins</b> [...] "a humdinger of bangs and bruises," [...] as {{it marked the}} first time the Stooges flatly refused to perform a stunt. In the film, during the game the boys are stopped by photographers to pose for a picture, when the {{football}} players then tackle them. The team consisted of genuine college football players, and the Stooges — with their small stature — were afraid of being hurt. Larry Fine, the smallest and lightest of the three, told director Raymond McCarey, [...] "Look, we can't do this scene. We're not stuntmen and if one of those gorillas falls on us, we'll never be able to finish the picture. We've never used stunt doubles before but we certainly need them now." [...] The fact that both Curly and Larry had been hurt a few days earlier filming Three Little <b>Pigskins</b> (Curly broke his leg riding down the dumbwaiter and Larry lost a tooth due to a mistimed punch) reinforced the trio's decision to opt out of the scene.|$|R

500|$|Holsters for the Type 94 pistol were {{generally}} made from either <b>pigskin</b> or cowhide leather and ranged in color from tan to dark reddish brown. Holsters faced the same degradation in quality as the Type 94 pistol. As supplies of leather were exhausted in Japan, holsters manufactured in 1944 became fabricated from olive drab fabric. The Type 94 pistol holster is distinguishable from other Japanese holsters having a pointed closure flap and a vertically positioned magazine pouch. The pouch tow has a narrow extension {{to accommodate a}} cleaning rod. The majority of holsters were made in civilian owned tanneries with some ink stamped with arsenal and inspection marks.

5000|$|Three Little <b>Pigskins</b> {{was filmed}} on October 25-30, 1934.

50|$|Tawing is {{a method}} that uses alum and {{aluminium}} salts, generally {{in conjunction with other}} products such as egg yolk, flour, and other salts. The leather becomes tawed by soaking in a warm potash alum and salts solution, between 20 and 30 °C. The process increases the leather's pliability, stretchability, softness, and quality. Adding egg yolk and flour to the standard soaking solution further enhances its fine handling characteristics. Then, the leather is air dried (crusted) for several weeks, which allows it to stabilize. Tawing is traditionally used on <b>pigskins</b> and goatskins to create the whitest colors. However, exposure and aging may cause slight yellowing over time and, if it remains in a wet condition, tawed leather will suffer from decay. Technically, tawing is not tanning.|$|R

[...] The same gag (which may not have been original even then) is often used subsequently, for example in the Three Stooges short, Three Little <b>Pigskins</b> (1934) and in the 1941 Abbott and Costello movie Hold That Ghost.

500|$|As the Star Weeklys {{circulation}} grew, so did its comics section. [...] Cranston encouraged Frise {{to create}} a Canada-themed comic strip in the vain of W.E.

[...] Frise turned focus to humorous and nostalgic depictions of rural life and on 12 December 1925 renamed his strip Birdseye Center, whose setting he described as [...] "any Canadian village"; its lead characters included bowler-hatted <b>Pigskin</b> Peters, Old Archie and his pet moose Foghorn, and lazy Eli Doolittle and his wife Ruby. [...] The strip grew in popularity and in 1926 was voted favourite comic strip in a readers' poll—as a write-in, since the strip did not appear in the list of options.|$|E

25|$|After an uncredited {{stint as}} a Goldwyn Girl in Roman Scandals (1933), {{starring}} Eddie Cantor and Gloria Stuart, Ball moved permanently to Hollywood to appear in films. She appeared in many small movie roles in the 1930s as a contract player for RKO Radio Pictures, including a two-reel comedy short with the Three Stooges (Three Little <b>Pigskins,</b> 1934) and a movie with the Marx Brothers (Room Service, 1938).

They continued making short films at a steady pace of eight per year, such as Three Little <b>Pigskins</b> (also 1934) with a young Lucille Ball), Pop Goes the Easel (1935), and Hoi Polloi (also 1935), in which two professors make a bet trying to turn the Three Stooges into gentlemen.|$|R
5000|$|The modern {{version of}} pig Latin {{appears in a}} 1919 Columbia Records album {{containing}} what sounds like the modern variation, by a singer named Arthur Fields. The song, called Pig Latin Love, {{is followed by the}} subtitle [...] "I-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day". The Three Stooges used it on multiple occasions, most notably Tassels in the Air, a 1938 short where Moe Howard attempts to teach Curley Howard how to use it, thereby conveying the rules to the audience. In an earlier (1934) episode, Three Little <b>Pigskins,</b> Larry Fine attempts to impress a woman with his skill in Pig Latin, {{but it turns out that}} she knows it, too. No explanation of the rules is given. A few months prior in 1934, in the Our Gang short film Washee Ironee, Spanky tries to speak to an Asian boy by using Pig Latin.
