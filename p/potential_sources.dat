5|$|UK Sport, the {{organisation}} responsible for distributing National Lottery funding to elite sport, set Team GB {{a target of}} winning three medals, of any colour, at the Vancouver Games; two more than the single silver medal won in Turin by Shelley Rudman.

The target was set following Â£6.5 million of funding in the four years leading up to the Games. Whilst no particular events were targeted as <b>potential</b> <b>sources</b> of medals, the success of British athletes in the previous four years was taken into account when setting the target; the men's curling team and the two-woman bobsleigh team, Nicola Minichiello and Gillian Cooke, won world championships, and in 2008 Kristan Bromley became the first man in the history of bob skeleton to win the World Championship, European Championship and World Cup in the same year.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the 19th {{century the}} demand for nitrates and ammonia for use as {{fertilizers}} and industrial feedstocks had been steadily increasing. The main source was mining niter deposits.

The obvious source was atmospheric nitrogen (N2), comprising nearly 80% of the air, however N2 is exceptionally stable and will not readily react with other chemicals. Converting N2 into ammonia posed a challenge for chemists globally.|$|E

40|$|Schemes {{to restore}} {{farmland}} biodiversity are often implemented at field scale while landscape scale factors are not considered. In a grassland dominated region in Switzerland we tested whether the landscape factor habitat connectivity could possibly increase {{the effectiveness of}} an agri-environment scheme for meadows. We investigated two indicator groups with contrasting dispersal abilities, land snails and orthopterans (grasshoppers). We investigated 27 extensively managed meadows grouped into 9 blocks. Each block consisted of three meadows differing in structural connectivity and land-use history: one meadow represented long-term, semi-naturally managed calcareous grassland that was considered as the <b>potential</b> <b>source</b> habitat. The other two meadows were restoration meadows, created 4 â 6 years ago. One of these restoration meadows was adjacent to the <b>potential</b> <b>source</b> meadow, the other isolated from it. We found a significantly higher species diversity of both invertebrate groups in the <b>potential</b> <b>source</b> meadows compared to the restoration meadows. Communities of both taxa were more similar to the <b>potential</b> <b>source</b> meadows in connected than in isolated restoration meadows. The species diversity of bad dispersers was negatively affected by isolation, but the diversity of good dispersers was unaffected. With respect to individual species occurrences, however, even good dispersers were negatively affected by isolation. We conclude that structural connectivity of restoration meadows to <b>potential</b> <b>source</b> habitats is important for increasing the restoration success of invertebrate communities, particularly of those containing species with limited dispersal abilities...|$|R
