40|$|The thesis {{examines}} how <b>policy</b> <b>processes</b> occur in practice over time, and advances a theory for understanding and explaining them using a complexity analytical lens. This lens {{provides a different}} way of 'seeing' <b>policy</b> <b>processes</b> holistically, in comparison with dominant alternative actor-focused, institutions-focused or idea-focused perspectives. The overall aims of the thesis are achieved through four phases. First, to construct the complexity lens, the thesis analyses the potential contribution of complexity theory, particularly as it relates to social systems and organisations. Second, existing theories of <b>policy</b> <b>processes</b> are scrutinised to identify areas where a complexity lens could provide new perspectives for their understanding, through a focus on: - 'wholes' of <b>policy</b> <b>processes</b> - <b>policy</b> problems and solutions - multiple participants - interactions within <b>policy</b> <b>processes</b> - dynamics within <b>policy</b> <b>processes.</b> Third, a study of New Zealand's tertiary education <b>policy</b> <b>processes</b> provides new empirical data. Data collected in unstructured interviews is represented in three differently-themed narratives, corresponding to three well-theorised analytical emphases: (1) participants; (2) institutions; and (3) ideas. The selection of three different perspectives takes into account the socially complex nature of <b>policy</b> <b>processes.</b> Fourth, the narrative data are examined through the complexity analytical lens and the results are compared with the views of <b>policy</b> <b>processes</b> obtained using the single lenses in the themed narratives. The four phases come together by demonstrating that viewing tertiary education <b>policy</b> <b>processes</b> through the complexity analytical lens provides a new perspective on <b>policy</b> <b>processes</b> which has implications for designing and intervening in <b>policy</b> <b>processes.</b> From this new perspective, <b>policy</b> <b>processes</b> are understood as complex social systems in interaction with other complex social systems. These systems consist of large numbers of interdependent and self-referencing participants, interacting with each other in ways that are nonlinear, influenced by prior experiences, and unpredictable in any precise sense...|$|R
40|$|Objectives To {{describe}} and analyse the <b>policy</b> <b>processes</b> related to maternal health in Vietnam. Methods A multi-method, retrospective {{comparative study of}} three case studies of maternal health policy processes-skilled birth attendance, adolescent reproductive health and domestic violence. It drew on primary qualitative data and secondary data. The underpinning conceptual framework of the study with key elements of <b>policy</b> <b>processes</b> is described. Results The study identified {{significant differences between the}} <b>policy</b> <b>processes</b> related to the different case studies. Various factors affect these processes. Critical amongst these are the nature of the policy, the involvement of different actors and the wider context both nationally and internationally. The changing national context is opening up increasing opportunities for civil society to interact with <b>policy</b> <b>processes.</b> Conclusions Understanding the nature of <b>policy</b> <b>processes</b> is critical to strengthen them, particularly in a changing environment. There is potential for a review of government <b>policy</b> <b>processes</b> which were developed in the period prior to Doi Moi to reflect the changing composition of civil society.

As politically underrepresented groups, both urban Aboriginal Peoples and Travellers rely on voluntary organizations to provide culturally appropriate programs and services and to advocate on their behalf. Applying a scalar analysis, this project isolated three key concepts that are critical to their inclusion in <b>policy</b> <b>processes.</b> First, is the incorporation of their issues and interests in cultural programs and services. Second, is group representation in <b>policy</b> <b>processes.</b> And third is their collaboration with government.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{critically}} examine how nurses have been involved in national <b>policy</b> <b>processes</b> in the Kenyan health sector. The paper reports qualitative results from a larger mixed method study. National nonnursing decision-makers and nurse leaders, and provincial managers as well as frontline nurse managers from two Kenyan districts were purposefully selected for interviews. Interviews dealt with nurses’ involvement in national <b>policy</b> <b>processes,</b> factors hindering nurses’ engagement in <b>policy</b> <b>processes,</b> and ways to enhance nurses’ involvement in <b>policy</b> <b>processes.</b> Critical theory and feminist perspectives guided the study process. Content analysis of data was conducted. Findings revealed that nurses’ involvement in <b>policy</b> <b>processes</b> in Kenya was limited. Only a few nurse leaders were involved in national policy committees as a result of their positions in the sector. Critical analysis of the findings revealed that hierarchies and structural factors as well as nursing professional issues were the primary barriers constraining nurses’ involvement in <b>policy</b> <b>processes.</b> Thus, there is need to address these factors both by nurses themselves and by nonnursing decision makers, in order to enhance nurses engagement in policy making and further the contribution to quality of services to the communities...|$|R
40|$|Research on <b>policy</b> <b>processes</b> {{has emerged}} {{over the last}} 30 - 40 years in Northern contexts. Such {{research}} has expanded into Southern contexts. An interest {{in the use of}} 'evidence' (such as research) in <b>policy</b> <b>processes</b> is a relatively recent phenomenon. There are, to date, relatively few empirical case studies in developing countries. This article seeks to address this gap by providing a comparative case study of two contexts at the opposite ends of the macro-political spectrum: Andhra Pradesh, India - a free participatory democracy with vibrant civil society - and Viet Nam - a society with, historically, more limited political freedom but with some recently introduced participatory processes and a fledgling civil society. We also consider the 'international' policy-making context. Senior policy makers and researchers working in child health policy formation were asked about their perceptions of the use of and quality of 'evidence' in health <b>policy</b> <b>processes.</b> It has been argued that greater levels of democratic freedoms are associated with greater use of evidence in <b>policy</b> <b>processes.</b> Our research challenges this and explores perceptions of the nature of 'evidence' and its use in <b>policy</b> <b>processes.</b> <b>policy</b> <b>processes,</b> child health, India, Viet Nam,...|$|R
2500|$|However, {{some critics}} argue that {{applying}} the subsidiarity principle to the CFP may not improve the policy's effectiveness, as it may lead to what de Vivero et al. term the [...] "participation paradox"—the theory that the greater the number of actors involved in the decision-making process, the less significant the contribution made by each actor, and the smaller the participatory role played in the <b>policy</b> <b>process.</b> Greater devolution within CFP decision-making may therefore silence {{the voice of the}} fisheries industry as it competes with other state, private and civil actors to whom authority is also granted. Thus, although the subsidiarity principle can facilitate the government-to-governance transition advocated by many in relation to reform of the CFP, the participatory role of key stakeholders affected by the policy must be maximised to ensure the development of an effective and equitable Common Fisheries Policy.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{development}} of co-management regimes and increased Aboriginal participation in the wildlife <b>policy</b> <b>process,</b> the colonial legacy of the state management era still lingers. These current bison conservation initiatives do not discuss Aboriginal use of subsistence resources in national parks and reserves. It is unclear whether Aboriginal participation and Traditional Ecological Knowledge will be incorporated into reintroduction plans. Although the Cree and Dene are now recognized as official participants {{in the management of}} wildlife and protected areas, Sandlos argues that this [...] "tentative shift in political power represents an incomplete attempt to decolonize wildlife management practices in the North." [...] The weak powers given to Aboriginal people on wildlife advisory boards allow the state to maintain political authority over wildlife resources, while giving the appearance of a participatory consensus-building approach with Aboriginal hunters. Sandlos suggests that the advisory nature of co-management boards is based on the implicit colonial assumption that local Aboriginal resource management systems are deficient, and that {{the role of the state}} is essential to the formation of wildlife policy in Canada's north.|$|E

40|$|This article {{reports on}} a {{comparative}} analysis to assess and explain {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of <b>policy</b> <b>processes</b> based on 9 case-studies of maternal health in Vietnam, India and China. <b>Policy</b> <b>processes</b> are often slow, inadequately coordinated and opaque to outsiders. Use of evidence is variable and, in particular, could be more actively used to assess different policy options. Whilst an increasing range of actors are involved, there is scope for further opening up of the <b>policy</b> <b>processes.</b> This is likely, if appropriately managed with due regard to issues such as accountability of advocacy organisations, to lead to stronger policy development and greater subsequent ownership; it may however be a more messy process to co-ordinate. Coordination is critical where policy issues span conventional sectoral boundaries, but is also essential to ensure development of policy considers critical health system and resource issues. This, and other features related to the nature of a specific policy issue, suggests the need both to adapt processes for each particular policy issue and to monitor the progress of the <b>policy</b> <b>processes</b> themselves. The article concludes with specific questions to be considered by actors keen to enhance <b>policy</b> <b>processes.</b> Health <b>policy</b> <b>processes</b> Maternal health Actors Evidence Context Vietnam India China...|$|R

40|$|Energy shocks {{like the}} Fukushima {{accident}} can have important political consequences. This article examines {{their impact on}} collaboration patterns between collective actors in <b>policy</b> <b>processes.</b> It argues that external shocks create both behavioral uncertainty, meaning that actors do not know about other actors' preferences, and policy uncertainty on the choice and consequences of policy instruments. The context of uncertainty interacts with classical drivers of actor collaboration in <b>policy</b> <b>processes.</b> The analysis {{is based on a}} dataset comprising interview and survey data on political actors in two subsequent <b>policy</b> <b>processes</b> in Switzerland and Exponential Random Graph Models for network data. Results first show that under uncertainty, collaboration of actors in <b>policy</b> <b>processes</b> is less based on similar preferences than in stable contexts, but trust and knowledge of other actors are more important.

40|$|The widely-recognised {{importance}} of robust health <b>policy</b> <b>processes</b> suggests {{the need for}} capacity to ensure these. Whilst research exists on capacity or <b>policy</b> <b>processes,</b> {{little is known about}} how these two are related. This study starts to fill this gap by developing a conceptual framework and testing in the Republic of Tajikistan, where independence reinforced the need for Ministry of Health's (MOH) capacity to conduct country-level <b>policy</b> <b>processes.</b> The following overarching research question guided this qualitative study: What are the key elements of, and main effects on, MOH capacity to conduct health <b>policy</b> <b>processes</b> in RT and how has this capacity changed since independence? Data was collected using semi-structured interviews, document reviews and observations of policy event. A framework approach was used for analysis, drawing on the conceptual framework. An understanding of what constitutes robust health <b>policy</b> <b>processes</b> is important and six characteristics were identified: holistic, evidence-informed, efficient, effective, feasible and sustainable. The conceptual framework distinguishes five components: MOH capacity to conduct <b>policy</b> <b>processes</b> (comprising elements of policy cycle, use of evidence, leadership and governance, and resources), actors, context, policy contents and policy results. This study explored the MOH capacity related to its management or response to the first three components. Though positive changes since independence were identified, the study found that MOH capacity is lacking in all following areas: recognising and managing stages of policy cycle, considering wider context, managing involvement of policy actors, ensuring evidence-informed <b>policy</b> <b>processes,</b> applying good governance and effective leadership, and establishing and effectively using resources. Each area is dynamic, interrelated with others and involves intra-relationships, with implications for overall MOH capacity. Two underlying issues are important: the need for both ability and willingness and the inter-relationships and interdependence between different capacity levels. As a result of the study a revised framework was developed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
