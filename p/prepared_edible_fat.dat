Rice (Oryza sativa) bran oil, mango (Mangifera indica) almond fat, and zapote mamey (Pouteria sapota) almond oil were studied. Results showed that in some countries, like Mexico, the recycling of rice bran still requires some technological adaptations due to the small sizes of its rice processing plants. Some physicochemical characteristics of mango almond fat were found {{similar to those of}} industrial <b>edible</b> <b>fats</b> and zapote mamey almond fat showed relevant yields from almond extraction and an interesting fatty acid composition...|$|R

40|$|Fats {{and oils}} play a {{prominent}} role in U. S. dietary patterns. Recent concerns over the negative health consequences associated with fats and oils have led many to suspect structural change in demand conditions. We consider short run (monthly) demand relationships for <b>edible</b> <b>fats</b> and oils. In that monthly quantities of fats and oils are likely to be relatively fixed, we utilize an inverse AIDS specification. Our analysis consists of two components. In the first, we utilize a smooth transition function to model a switching inverse almost ideal demand system (IAIDS) that assesses short-run demand conditions for <b>edible</b> <b>fats</b> and oils in the U. S. Our results suggest that short-run demand conditions for fats and oils experienced a rather rapid structural shift in the early 1990 s. Although this shift generally made price flexibilities more elastic, differences in flexibilities across regimes are modest in most cases. Our results suggest that decreases in marginal valuations for most fats and oils in response to consumption increases are rather small. Scale flexibilities are relatively close to - 1, suggesting near homothetic preferences for fats and oils. An important distinction occurs for lard and tallow, which exhibit a very elastic scale response. This suggests that scale increases in the consumption of <b>edible</b> <b>fats</b> and oils will significantly decrease consumers' marginal valuation of these animal fats. A second segment of our analysis considers dynamic extensions to the IAIDS model that recognize habit effects. Although nested hypothesis testing supports the dynamic specification over the static IAIDS model, price and scale flexibilities are quite similar to the static case.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades <b>edible</b> <b>fats</b> and oils {{suffered}} a severe loss of image by being considered {{to be one of}} the main causes for the steady rise in overweight and diseases of civilisation among the Western population. Numerous recent research studies on characteristics of specific fatty acids (type and composition) call for a paradigm shift reevaluating <b>edible</b> <b>fats</b> by placing greater emphasis on the quality rather than quantity of total fatty intake. This includes for instance, unhealthy LDL-increasing trans-fatty acids &# 8211; formed during the hydrogenation process of vegetable oils &# 8211; and saturated fatty acids from animal products. These ought to be replaced by vegetable oils of which rapeseed and olive oil are regarded to be particularly physiological point of view. Due to their high content of monoand polyunsaturated fatty acids in combination with a most suitable fatty acid pattern, they harbour a strong cardioprotective and anti-atherogenic potential.

This is the second of three scientific opinions by the Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM Panel), in which thirty-five of these substances or groups of substances have been evaluated. The CONTAM Panel concluded that fatty acids, fatty alcohols, fatty alcohol blends, fatty acid methyl esters, fatty acid esters, and animal, marine and vegetable and hydrogenated oils and fats, all as specified, and acid oils and fatty acid distillates, acetic acid, sulphuric acid, formic acid, acetic anhydride, acetone, n-heptane, n-hexane, cyclohexane, pentane, iso-propanol, propyl alcohol, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone, n-propyl acetate, ammonium hydroxide, limonene, methyl tert-butyl ether, urea ammonia nitrate solution, calcium chloride solution, magnesium chloride solution, potable water, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, silicon dioxide, sorbitol, molasses and beeswax would not be of health concern as previous cargoes. However, because of its insolubility in water and high melting point, silicon dioxide is not suitable for transport in tankers for <b>edible</b> <b>fats</b> and oils.

40|$|<b>Edible</b> <b>fats</b> {{and oils}} from vegetable, animal and marine sources have been traded and shipped for {{thousands}} of years, as they forman {{important part of the}} human diet. Increasing global food trade has meant that the geographical source of these commodities has been broadening steadily. The availability of sea-going vessels reserved for the transport of foodstuffs is insufficient to serve the continuing trade in oils and fats intended for human consumption. A practical solution has been adopted by the industry and involves the bulk transport of fats and oils in vessel tanks that are not exclusively reserved for the transport of foodstuffs. Efforts are ongoing to ensure cargoes of fats and oils are not contaminated with previous cargoes. The Codex Alimentarius Commission has adopted a recommended international code of practice for the storage and transport of <b>edible</b> <b>fats</b> and oil in bulk.

30|$|In most cases, the {{residues}} generated {{during the}} extraction of oil from oilseeds contain bioactive substances, such as phenolic compounds, flavonoids, and lignans [26]. These compounds {{could be used as}} natural antioxidants for the protection of fats and oils against oxidative damage. Tocopherols from soybean and palm are widely applied antioxidants for the stabilization of <b>edible</b> <b>fats</b> and oils. The extraction of such antioxidants from the residues of oilseeds can be considered to contribute to the added value of these wastes. It might be difficult to use the antioxidants from residues of Jatropha oil for <b>edible</b> <b>fats</b> and oil products; however, the catechol lignans/neolignans from Jatropha wastes would be applicable as stabilizers of Jatropha biodiesel [27]. The average quantity of Jatropha oil obtained per 100  g of kernel was ca 30  ml, and 3, 3 ′-bisdemethylpinoresinol (1, 6.66  mg), isoamericanol A (2, 4.89  mg), americanol A (3, 1.89  mg), 9 ′-O-methylisoamericanol A (4, 1.7  mg), 9 ′-O-methylamericanol A (5, 0.53  mg), isoamericanin A (6, 0.34  mg), isoprincepin (7, 1.7  mg), and princepin (8, 0.76  mg) were prepared from the 100  g of kernel in this study. The yield of antioxidants would be sufficient to inhibit oxidation of the Jatropha oil. Further study is needed to more efficiently recover and utilize the antioxidants in Jatropha biodiesel industries.|$|R
40|$|The Chemical and Veterinary Test Agency (CVUA) Stuttgart has {{detected}} glycidol {{fatty acid}} esters in refined vegetable fats on a palm oil base. The analytical methods currently available do not, however, permit the determination, merely {{the estimation of}} the exact levels. Fur-thermore, {{we do not know}} what levels of glycidol are released from the glycidol fatty acid esters during digestion in humans. Based on findings from animal experiments, glycidol is classified as probably carcinogenic to humans. Because of this major hazard potential and because refined <b>edible</b> <b>fats</b> are used in products like margarine and in infant formula, too, the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) takes the findings of CVUA Stuttgart seriously and presents its initial evaluation of the as-sessment whether the detected ester-bound glycidol could constitute a threat to health. This evaluation is based on the worst case scenario that glycidol is released fully during digestion from the fatty acid esters and is then available in the organism. As the exact levels of glycidol fatty acid esters could not be reliably determined up to now in vegetable fats, BfR adopts the hypothetical assumption that one kilogram of <b>edible</b> <b>fat</b> contains one milligram glycidol. Based on this calculation, BfR comes to the conclusion that infants who are fed exclusively industrially prepared infant milk formula would take in harmful levels of glycidol...|$|R
