50|$|The <b>phenylene</b> group (C6H4) {{is based}} on a di-substituted benzene ring (arylene). For example, poly(p-phenylene) is a polymer built up from para-phenylene repeating units.|$|E
50|$|The <b>phenylene</b> {{rings in}} this {{molecule}} {{are free to}} rotate forming a set of conformers: one with a Möbius half-twist and another with a Hückel double-twist (a figure-eight configuration) of roughly equal energy.|$|E
40|$|Several {{recently}} published papers report expressions for various vertex-degree-based molecular structure descriptors of benzenoid systems and <b>phenylenes.</b> We deduce here the general expression for these descriptors, {{and show that}} a simple and generally valid relation exists between such structure descriptors of <b>phenylenes</b> and their hexagonal squeezes...|$|R
40|$|The hyper-Wiener index WW of a graph G {{is defined}} as WW(G)) (∑d (u, V) 2 + ∑d (u, V)) / 2, where d (u, V) denotes the {{distance}} between the vertices u and V in the graph G and the summations run over all (unordered) pairs of vertices of G. We consider three different methods for calculating the hyper-Wiener index of molecular graphs: the cut method, the method of Hosoya polynomials, and the interpolation method. Along the way we obtain new closed-form expressions for the WW of linear <b>phenylenes,</b> cyclic <b>phenylenes,</b> poly(azulenes), and several families of periodic hexagonal chains. We also verify some previously known (but not mathematically proved) formulas...|$|R

50|$|An arylene or arenediyl is a {{substituent}} of {{an organic}} compound that {{is derived from}} an aromatic hydrocarbon (arene) that has had a hydrogen atom removed from two ring carbon atoms, such as <b>phenylene.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{benzopyrene}} is {{an organic}} compound with the formula C20H12. Structurally speaking, the colorless isomers of benzopyrene are pentacyclic hydrocarbons and are fusion products of pyrene and a <b>phenylene</b> group. Two isomeric species of benzopyrene are benzoapyrene {{and the less}} common benzoepyrene. They belong to the chemical class of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.|$|E
50|$|Mesoporous organosilicas {{have been}} tested as {{potential}} materials for separation using HPLC. Froba et al. have shown that by using benzene PMO microspheres as stationary phases better separation can be achieved in the HPLC system. The theory was that the π-π interaction between the aromatic analytes and the <b>phenylene</b> bridge of the PMO framework leads to stronger retention and hence better separation.|$|E
40|$|Field-effect {{mobility}} and threshold voltage are modulated by functionalizing gold electrodes with chemisorbed SAMs of aromatic thiols having {{an increasing number}} of <b>phenylenes.</b> The contact resistance in poly(3 -hexylthiophene) -based TFTs was found to be ruled by the joint effect of the energetic alignment between metal and semiconductor, the interfacial morphology and tunneling resistance of the SAMs...|$|R
50|$|Cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) are para linked oligophenylenes {{that form}} a cyclophane. The first {{reported}} synthesis was in 2008 by Jasti and Bertozzi which was quickly followed up by syntheses by both Itami in 2009 and Yamago in 2010. Cycloparaphenylenes {{have been said}} to be the shortest carbon nanotubes ever synthesized, however, have properties that are distinct from their longer counterparts. To date, the smallest cycloparaphenylene has only five <b>phenylenes.</b>|$|R
40|$|Bis-iminophosphoranes {{containing}} {{various types}} of linkers between two R 3 PN moieties were electrochemically oxidized at controlled potential in situ in the electron spin resonance (ESR) cavity. For linkers constituted of <b>phenylenes,</b> conjugated <b>phenylenes</b> or merely a dicyanoethylenic bond, this oxidation led to well-resolved ESR spectra which were characterized by their g values and by their 1 H, 14 N and 31 P isotropic hyperfine constants. These coupling constants agree with those calculated by DFT for the corresponding cation radicals. Experimental and theoretical results clearly indicate that in these species the unpaired electron is mostly delocalized on the bridge and on the nitrogen atoms while the spin density on the phosphorus atoms is particularly small. Cyclic voltammetry and ESR spectra show {{that the nature of}} the bridge between the two iminophosphoranes considerably influences the oxidation potential of the compound as well as the stability of the radical cation. Information about the conformation of the precursor containing two Ph 3 PN moieties separated by a C(CN) C(CN) group was obtained from its crystal structure...|$|R
5000|$|A pillarnarene macrocycle, with n {{hydroquinone}} units, has n {{planes of}} chirality. DMpillar5arene has five planes of chirality which are [...] "in sync" [...] {{in the lowest}} energy conformational isomer due to unfavorable steric interactions between the methoxy groups of neighboring 1,4-dimethoxy-phenylene units. The absolute stereochemical designation of these planes of chirality in pillararene structures can be assigned following modified Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules. The pilot atom {{for one of the}} five planes of chirality in pillar5arene is assigned to the highest priority atom that is not in the chiral plane - the first carbon atom of the neighboring <b>phenylene</b> unit. The three adjacent in-plane atoms are then assigned, starting with the methylene carbon attached to the pilot atom as priority 1, and the directly connected <b>phenylene</b> carbon as 2, and the carbon atom connected to the methoxy group as 3. When viewed {{from the side of the}} pilot atom, if the three atoms form a clockwise direction when followed in order of priority, the molecule is assigned as R(p), otherwise it is assigned as S(p).|$|E
50|$|The Brønsted {{equation}} gives {{information about}} a reaction mechanism. Reactions that have low values for proportionality constants α or β are considered to have a transition state closely resembling the reactant with little proton transfer. With a high value, proton transfer in the transition state is almost complete. In a study {{of a group of}} phenalene compounds it was concluded from Brønsted analysis that phenalene acidity is very different from either indene acidity or <b>phenylene</b> acidity 1.|$|E
50|$|Another {{family of}} catenanes are called pretzelanes or bridged 2catenanes after their {{likeness}} to pretzels with a spacer linking the two macrocycles. In one such system one macrocycle is an electron deficient oligo Bis-bipyridinium ring {{and the other}} cycle is crown ether cyclophane based on para <b>phenylene</b> or naphthalene. X-ray diffraction shows that due to pi-pi interactions the aromatic group of the cyclophane is held firmly inside the pyridinium ring. A limited number of (rapidly interchanging) conformers exist {{for this type of}} compound.|$|E
40|$|Polynomial {{interpolation}} {{can be used}} {{to obtain}} closed formulas for topological indices of infinite series of molecular graphs. The method is discussed and its advantages and limitations are pointed out. This is illustrated on fullerenes C 12 k+ 4 and four topological in-dices: the Wiener index, the edge Wiener index, the eccentric connectivity index, and the reverse Wiener index. The results for the edge Wiener index correct earlier computations from the literature. Related formulas are derived for cyclic <b>phenylenes.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we generalize {{the result}} of Behmaram, Yousefi-Azari, and Ashrafi proved in 2012 for calculating the Wiener {{polarity}} index of a graph. An important advantage of our generalization {{is that it can}} be used for graphs that contain 4 -cycles and also for graphs whose different cycles have more than one common edge. In addition, using the main result a closed formula for the Wiener polarity index is derived for <b>phenylenes</b> and recalculated for catacondensed benzenoid graphs...|$|R
40|$|A general {{description}} of the cut method is presented and an overview of its applications in chemical graph theory is given. Applications include the Wiener index, the Szeged index, the hyper-Wiener index, the PI index, the weighted Wiener index, Wiener-type indices, and classes of chemical graphs such as trees, benzenoid graphs and <b>phenylenes.</b> A computation of the Wiener index of an arbitrary connected graph using its canonical metric representation is described. Algorithmic issues are also briefly mentioned as well as are the recently introduced CI index and related polynomials...|$|R
50|$|PAEK {{plastics}} {{are characterized}} by <b>phenylene</b> rings that are linked via oxygen bridges (ether and carbonyl groups (ketone)). The ratio and sequence of ether to ketones mainly affects the glass transition temperature and melting point of the polymer. It also affects its heat resistance and processing temperature. The higher the ratio of ketones the more rigid the polymer chain, which results in a higher glass transition temperature and melting point. The processing temperatures can range from 350 to 430 °C.|$|E
5000|$|The {{activation}} H2 using FLPs {{was first}} reported in 2006. The hydrogen adduct {{of the original}} FLP, a phosphonium-borate salt, is prepared by combining a <b>phenylene</b> bridged phosphinoborane and dihydrogen. The salt, which is colorless, is stable {{in the presence of}} air and moisture. It releases molecular H2 when heated above 100 °C. Along with H2 Some FLPs react with CO2. Specifically carbon dioxide fixation was demonstrated using P(tBu)3 which attacks the electronegative carbon and the Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 which accepts an electron pair from an oxygen atom: ...|$|E
50|$|It {{was this}} {{need for a}} greater {{understanding}} of the process that triggered Dr. Palin’s classic work on chlorination chemistry and his development of new test procedures, including the first practical method for the separate determination of free chlorine, monochloramine, dichloramine and nitrogen trichloride, all of which may, under certain conditions, be found in chlorinated water. It was the development of this analytical method, using the indicator diethyl para <b>phenylene</b> diamine (DPD), that provided the key to {{open the door to the}} explanation of the breakpoint in chlorination and laid the foundation for the present classification of modern processes.|$|E
40|$|The cut method {{proved to}} be utmost useful to obtain fast {{algorithms}} and closed formulas for classical distance based invariants of graphs isometrically embeddable into hypercubes. These graphs are known as partial cubes and in particular contain numerous chemically important graphs such as trees, ben-zenoid graphs, and <b>phenylenes.</b> It is proved that the cut method {{can be used to}} compute an arbitrary distance moment of all the graphs that are isometrically embeddable into Cartesian products of triangles, a class much larger than par-tial cubes. The method in particular covers the Wiener index, the hyper-Wiener index, and the Tratch-Stankevich-Zefirov index...|$|R
40|$|Structural codes vis-a-vis {{structural}} counts, like polynomials of {{a molecular}} graph, {{are important in}} computing graph-theoretical descriptors which {{are commonly known as}} topological indices. These indices are most important for characterizing carbon nanotubes (CNTs). In this paper we have computed Sadhana index (Sd) for <b>phenylenes</b> and their hexagonal squeezes using structural codes (counts). Sadhana index is a very simple W-Sz-PI-type topological index obtained by summing the number of edges {{on both sides of the}} elementary cuts of benzenoid graphs. It has the similar discriminating power as that of the Weiner (W) -, Szeged (Sz) -, and PI-indices...|$|R
40|$|We {{review the}} {{solid state physics}} {{approach}} to electronic and optical properties of conducting polymers also with attempts to bring together languages of the solid state theory for polymers and the quantum chemistry of oligomers. We consider polymers as generic one-dimensional semiconductors with features of strongly correlated electronic systems. Our model combines the long range electron–hole Coulomb attraction with a specific effect of strong intra-monomer electronic correlations, which results in effective intra-monomer electron–hole repulsion. We explain, exploit and organize various experimental and numerical findings. For example we connect such different questions as shallow singlet and deep triplet excitons in <b>phenylenes,</b> Ag–Bu exciton levels crossing in polyenes, common 1 /N energy dependencies in oligomers...|$|R
5000|$|For example, {{several studies}} in 2002 with a p-phenylene rotor {{found that some}} {{structures}} using variable-temperature (VT) solid-state 13C CPMAS and quadrupolar echo 2H NMR were able to detect a two-site exchange rate of 1.6 MHz (over 106/second at 65 °C), described as [...] "remarkably fast for a <b>phenylene</b> group in a crystalline solid", with steric barriers of 12-14 kcal/mol. However, tert-butyl modification of the rotor increased the exchange rate to over 108 per second at room temperature, and the rate for inertially rotating p-phenylene without barriers {{is estimated to be}} approximately 2.4 x 1012 revolutions per second.|$|E
5000|$|The Feringa {{principle}} {{has been}} incorporated into a prototype nanocar. The car synthesized has a helicene-derived engine with an oligo (<b>phenylene</b> ethynylene) chassis and four carborane wheels {{and is expected to}} be able to move on a solid surface with scanning tunneling microscopy monitoring, although so far this has not been observed. The motor does not perform with fullerene wheels because they quench the photochemistry of the motor moiety. Feringa motors have also been shown to remain operable when chemically attached to solid surfaces. [...] The ability of certain Feringa systems to act as an asymmetric catalyst has also been demonstrated.|$|E
40|$|Five {{types of}} {{conjugated}} <b>phenylene</b> polymer-modified photoanodes for quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) were prepared by immobilization of CdSe QDs after electrochemical polymerization of functionalized phenyldiazonium salts onto ITO glass electrodes. The successful {{preparation of the}} conjugated <b>phenylene</b> polymer-modified photoanodes for QDSSCs was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), FT-IR spectroscopy, UV-visible spectroscopy, contact angles, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The open-circuit voltage and fill factor in QDSSCs with the conjugated <b>phenylene</b> polymer with -COOH photoanodes were achieved at 0. 52 [*]V and 76. 8 %, respectively, and the energy conversion efficiency was improved to 2. 73 % using the conjugated <b>phenylene</b> polymer with -COOH photoanodes...|$|E
40|$|The {{distance}} d(u, v|G) {{between the}} vertices u and v of a molecular graph G is {{the length of}} a shortest u, v-path. We consider a class of Wiener–type topological indices Wλ(G), defined as the sum of the terms d(u, v|G) λ over all pairs of vertices of G. Several special cases of Wλ(G), namely for λ = + 1 (the original Wiener number) as well as for λ = − 2,− 1,+ 1 / 2,+ 2 and + 3, were previously studied in the chemical literature, and found applications as molecular structure–descriptors. We establish a relation between Wλ+ 1 and Wλ, applicable for benzenoid molecules, <b>phenylenes,</b> chemical trees, and other types of molecular graphs. 1...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} years, self-assembled organic {{nanostructures}} {{have been recognized}} as a proper fundament for several electrical and optical applications. In particular, <b>phenylenes</b> deposited on muscovite mica {{have turned out to}} be an outstanding material combination. They tend to align parallel to each other forming needlelike structures. In that way, they provide the key for macroscopic highly polarized emission, waveguiding, and lasing. The resulting anisotropy has been interpreted so far by an induced dipole originating from the muscovite mica substrate. Based on a combined experimental and theoretical approach, we present an alternative growth model being able to explain molecular adsorption on sheet silicates in terms of molecule-surface interactions only. By a comprehensive comparison between experiments and simulations, we demonstrate that geometrical changes in the substrate surface or molecule lead to different molecular adsorption geometries and needle directions which can be predicted by our growth model...|$|R
40|$|Periodic nano-lines in a {{large area}} have been formed on {{polyimide}} surface using polarized pulsed laser-inducing of the fourth harmonic Nd : YAG laser. The linear direction {{is parallel to the}} polarization direction and the periodical width of these lines is 200 nm. The dichroism due to the alignments of functional group in periodic nano-structure has been studied by recording polarized reflected FTIR spectra at 0 degrees polarization parallel to the polymer lines and 90 degrees polarization lines. We found that C = O stretching at 1 722 cm(- 1) in the irradiated area has a stronger response than in the nonirradiated area when the IR polarization direction is parallel to the lines, while the band at 1 231 cm(- 1) assigned to C-C-C between <b>phenylenes</b> and the methylene groups has a stronger response when the polarized IR direction is perpendicular to the lines. The dichroic spectrum indicates that in the irradiated area polyimide molecular chains are preferentially oriented perpendicular to the nano-line direction. The orientation is caused by the directional electric field associated with the polarized laser beam during the melting and cooling process, while the polar carbonyl groups are subjected to the orientation in the electric field direction...|$|R
40|$|Copolymerization of <b>phenylene</b> sulfide (PS) and <b>phenylene</b> sulfide ether (PSE) {{was carried}} out with various {{composition}} ratios. Their thermal properties and crystallization behaviors were studied and {{compared with those of}} poly (<b>phenylene</b> sulfide) (PPS). All of the copolymers show only one glass transition temperature (Tg). Tg and melting temperature of copolymer were decreased as the content of PSE increases. Especially, these temperatures were decreased prominently when 5 % of PSE unit was added. Isothermal crystallization behaviors of the copolymers were investigated by Avrami equation. In the region of cold crystallization temperature, crystallization rate constants increased and Avrami exponent (n) decreased as the temperature increased. Copolymers containing PSE unit in a concentration range of 5 to 20 % have high n values near 3. However, this effect was diminished by addition of PSE unit over 20 %. In the cases of poly (<b>phenylene</b> sulfide) (PPS) and PPS/poly (<b>phenylene</b> sulfide ether) blend, n values are in the range of 1. 5 - 2.

40|$|Individual Kekule valence {{structures}} of biphenylene and related hydrocarbons are treated perturbatively by modelling them as sets of weakly-interacting uniform double bonds. Total pi-electron energies of these structures are then {{expressed in the}} form of power series with respect to the resonance parameter of uniform single bonds. On this basis, the Kekule structures concerned are ordered according to their relative stabilities and thereby importances when building up the actual electronic structures. To rationalize the results, interrelations are sought between separate members of the power series, on the one hand, and presence of definite substructures in the given Kekule structure, on the other hand. It is shown that monocycles containing two and four exocyclic methylene groups participate in the formation of energy corrections of the relevant Kekule valence structures along with the usual rings consisting of uniform double and single bonds alternately and known as conjugated circuits. An extension of the empirical Fries rule to the case of biphenylene-like hydrocarbons is consequently formulated that embraces monocycles of the above-specified types. The reasons are also discussed why the results of the usual theory of conjugated circuits are less satisfactory for <b>phenylenes</b> as compared to benzenoids.

40|$|The complex {{dynamics}} in supramolecular structures of poly(p- <b>phenylenes)</b> with short ethylene oxide (EO) side chains (known as "hairy rods") {{have been studied}} by combining temperature and pressure dependent dielectric spectroscopy (DS) with different nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. The system forms a periodic lattice of layers of the main chains separated by layers of the amorphous EO chains. Since the dipole moment {{is located on the}} EO side chain, DS is probing mainly the side- chain motions and only indirectly the backbone dynamics. On the other hand, the different NMR techniques are also sensitive to the backbone mobility and provide the molecular origin of the dynamic processes. Two dielectrically active processes exist, a "fast" beta (which differs from the usual Johari-Goldstein beta process found in homopolymers and low molecular weight glass- forming liquids) and a "slow" alpha process with the latter carrying most of the intensity. Comparison of the NMR and dielectric results identifies the outer EO units as solely responsible for the dielectric beta process whereas both the short EO segments and the unfreezing of the internal backbone {{dynamics in}}cluding bending motions contribute to the alpha process. The unfreezing of the backbone dynamics does not lead to the dissolution of the structure that only happens at even higher temperatures. Hairy rod molecules thus can serve as model systems which provide the means of studying the effect of confinement on the dynamics. In this respect, the effect of confinement is mainly on the temperature dependence of the alpha-process relaxation times. (C) 2002 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
