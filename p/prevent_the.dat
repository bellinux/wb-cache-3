The United States Constitution did not give local government authority to <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> buildings {{on the grounds of}} aesthetics alone, and any such law in New York was considered likely to face judicial challenge.|$|E

5|$|After the Kid {{returns and}} recovers, Rucks gives him another choice: He {{can have the}} Bastion rewind time to before the Calamity {{in the hopes of}} {{preventing}} it, or use it to evacuate the survivors and move on to somewhere safe. Rucks is unsure if there is any way to <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> Calamity from reoccurring if the time is rewound, as {{there was no way to}} test the process. The game ends either way, showing images of the characters (with the inclusion of Zulf if the player chose to rescue him) flying away or of their lives before the Calamity along with the credits. In the New Game+ mode, which is unlocked after beating the game once, it is hinted that restoring the world didn't <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> Calamity.|$|E

5|$|Although condoms {{effectively}} <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> {{sexual transmission}} of HIV, several factors have limited widespread condom distribution and uptake in Malawi. People living in non-urban areas often have difficulty accessing condoms, and condoms are not typically available at bars {{and other social}} locations where {{they could have a}} significant impact on HIV prevention. Many people oppose condoms because they believe that condoms make sex less enjoyable or because they question their ability to <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> transmission of HIV. However, despite these factors, many unmarried couples have started using condoms more consistently as concern and fear about the HIV/AIDS epidemic have increased.|$|E
