25|$|The 1950s, saw a deep {{reorganization}} of the military forces in Portugal. The ground forces in the Overseas were finally merged with the Metropolitan Army, with a single Portuguese Army existing from then on. The creation of the Armed Forces as an integrated organization, {{led to the creation}} of the permanent roles of commander-in-chief to serve as the unified operational commanders of all the ground, air and naval forces stationed in each of the Overseas provinces. This commanders-in-chief will soon increase their operational importance, over the local service commanders, with the Army territorial commands in each province going to have mere logistical responsibilities. In the scope of the peak of the Cold War, the organization of the Portuguese Army in the Overseas was built with a concern on the imminent threat of war in Europe, compared with a low <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> of conflicts in the Overseas provinces themselves. So, the Overseas forces were re-organized, going from a focus on the internal security to a focus on the conventional warfare, at the same time being oriented to be able to reinforce the Army in Europe and not the opposite. As part of these, the previous military organization based in small company-sized units scattered along the territory was replaced by an organization based in battalion and even regiment-sized units concentrated in the main cities. In Angola and Mozambique, this structure was designed to allow the raising of entire field divisions to be deployed to European Portugal in case of a conventional warfare with the Warsaw Pact.|$|E

40|$|To {{reduce the}} {{widespread}} unlawful downloading of copyrighted media, industry has responded via litigation against individual file sharers and by lobbying governments to strengthen intellectual property laws. Such approaches have had limited success in reducing unlawful content sharing. We explore how much <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> legal <b>risk</b> impact upon stated unlawful {{behaviour as well}} as how relevant factors such as the perceived benefits of unlawful file sharing, trust in industry and legal regulators, and perceived anonymity online impact upon this perceived risk. We examine these questions via a large two-part survey of consumers of music (n = 658) and eBooks (n = 737). We find <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> legal <b>risk</b> fail to predict stated file sharing behaviour, while the perceived benefit of unlawfully downloaded files does predict behaviour. The relationship between perceived risk and behaviour is partially mitigated by perceived benefits. We also show that trust in industry and regulators enhance <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk,</b> while <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> anonymity lower <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk.</b> High trust and high anonymity impact on the effect of perceived benefit on risk perception.

Background: Attitudes and <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> regarding the use of morphine for analgesia amongst nurses remain problematic, thus potentially leading to important consequences regarding the quality of pain management. Methods: A cross-sectional survey among 557 nursing-students enrolled in the 3 -year bachelor program was conducted in the French-speaking part of Switzerland from May to December 2010. The instrument&# 39;s validity and internal reliability were tested before use. Twenty-two items evaluated attitudes and <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> when using morphine.
