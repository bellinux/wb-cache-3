Included in this year's TFAWS is a panel session on Multidisciplinary Analysis techniques. The intent is to provide an {{opportunity}} for the users to gain information as to what product may be best suited for their applications environment and to provide feedback to you, the developers, on future desired developments. Potential users of multidisciplinary analysis (MDA) techniques are often overwhelmed by the number of choices available to them via commercial products and by the pace of new developments in this area. The purpose of this panel session is to provide a forum wherein MDA tools available and under development can be discussed, compared, and contrasted. The intent of this panel is to provide the end-user with the information necessary to make educated decisions on how to proceed with selecting their MDA tool. It is anticipated that the discussions this year will focus on MDA techniques that couple discipline codes or algorithms (as opposed to monolithic, unified MDA approaches). The MDA developers will be asked to prepare a product overview presentation addressing specific questions provided by the <b>panel</b> <b>organizers.</b> The purpose of these questions will be to establish the method employed by the particular MDA technique for communication between the discipline codes, to establish the similarities and differences amongst the various approaches, and to establish the range of experience and applications for each particular MDA approach...|$|R

40|$|Georgia Law to host Ebola panel {{covering}} {{domestic and}} international issues Wednesday, January 7, 2015 Writer: Heidi M. Murphy, 706 / 583 - 5487, hmurphy@uga. edu Contact: Laura Tate Kagel, 706 / 542 - 5141, lkagel@. uga. edu UGA School of Law to host Ebola panel covering {{domestic and international}} issues Athens, Ga. – The University of Georgia School of Law’s Dean Rusk Center for International Law and Policy will host a panel discussion on domestic and international issues relating to the Ebola virus on Jan. 21 at 12 : 30 p. m. in the Larry Walker Room of Dean Rusk Hall on North Campus. The event is free {{and open to the}} public. The current Ebola outbreak has claimed more than 6, 000 lives and it has spread to not only six African countries, but also to North America and Europe, according to <b>panel</b> <b>organizer</b> and moderator Fazal Khan, who is an associate professor at the law school. “Other contagious aspects of the Ebola epidemic have been fear of groups and individuals who may have been exposed to the virus and distrust of official responses to control the outbreak,” Khan said. “Furthermore, for governments and public health organizations combatting the spread of Ebola, this outbreak poses a significant challenge as these actors have to navigate through legal and public health governance systems at both the international and domestic levels. ” With experts in international public health law, domestic public health law and global public health policy, the panel will address: what authority the federal government has to detain, isolate and/or quarantine individuals with Ebola; consent and privacy issues for Ebola patients undergoing treatment; travel restrictions for people leaving West Africa and the sealing of borders for countries with an Ebola epidemic; the roll out of experimental drugs being developed in the United States to Africa and the significance of Ebola being identified as a threat to international peace and security by United Nations Security Council Resolution 2177. The panelists will include: Matthew Penn, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Public Health Law Program Director; Polly J. Price, Emory University professor of law; and Phaedra S. Corso, UGA College of Public Health’s UGA Foundation Professor of Human Health. For more information, please contact Laura Tate Kagel at lkagel@uga. edu.

30|$|I {{told the}} <b>panel</b> <b>organizers</b> that my {{comments}} {{would focus on}} Chapter Four, “The Search for a Universal Method.” In this chapter, Adluri and Bagchee move away from specific historical discussions of individual German scholars, and articulate a number of basic and, to my mind, well-grounded claims. First, German Indology, even after its emergence from within Protestant biblical studies, remained a thinly scientized or secularized form of Protestant theology. This is not only because Christian theological presuppositions informed the particular reconstructions made by German scholars of Hindu texts, {{but also because the}} very practice of so rearranging these texts expressed a mode of relating to written scripture that had been developed after the Reformation. Second, the process of institutionalizing a hegemonic discipline of academic Indology in Germany reflected a bias, shared also with biblical studies, that Protestant modes of historical criticism were substantively identical with scientific method and consciousness. Third, both of these sets of biases depended fundamentally on a Protestant version of supersessionism, meaning the idea that Christian forms of knowledge had transcended and replaced older, less reliable forms of knowledge, a claim that was applied, both implicitly and often explicitly, against Brahmanism as it had originally been applied by Christians against Jews and pagans, and against Roman Catholics by Protestants. The appropriation of the authority to reinterpret, in wholesale fashion, textual traditions was not something that emerged only with the European discovery of India, although it derived a powerful impetus from that discovery. This appropriation was inherent already in the Christian designation of the Hebrew Bible as the “Old Testament.” This required, from the early centuries of the Christian era, the claim that the New Testament revealed the “true meaning” glimpsed only dimly in the now-superseded Jewish tradition. A corollary of this was the claim that the Rabbis had falsified the texts, which accordingly needed to be rescued from their now-discredited custodians.|$|R
3000|$|... a) The first {{suggestion}} {{draws on}} considerations {{made by a}} group of US scholars aiming at fostering more meaningful, effective, and sustainable citizen participation in science and technology (see, for instance, Powell and Colin 2008, 2009; Powell and Kleinman 2008; Powell et al. 2011; Kleinman et al. 2011). These authors’ reflections start from a critique of ongoing participatory exercises, particularly in the field of nanotechnology. They argue that exercises such as consensus conferences regularly have no discernable political or other societal impacts, that their goals are seldom clearly articulated, and that they are unlikely to prepare citizens for ‘real-world’ political participation, “which is long term, seldom controlled or facilitated, and often contentious” (Powell and Colin 2008 : 129). This even raises suspicions that many procedures “are simply short-term ‘exercises’ that are analyzed for eventual publication in scholarly journals” (ibid.: 128). In addition, by attempting to create “blank slate” citizen <b>panels,</b> the <b>organizers</b> of pTA procedures “risk the exclusion {{of some of the most}} interesting (and interested) and dynamic potential participants” (Kleinman et al. 2011 : 237).|$|R
30|$|This {{might have}} {{influenced}} both the expectations {{on and the}} perceptions of the outcomes of the dialogue process. During the first two rounds, we have observed a number of hints that support the relevance of this point. It was not only the ministry that was pushing the organizers to guarantee a ‘representative’ composition of participants in the various events. Also a number of dialogue participants approached members of the organizing teams and shared their impressions that they perceive the panels as being not representative for the society at large. They especially mentioned that they felt that younger people or people with a migration background were under-represented. It seems that there is something like an ‘expected representativeness’ of the <b>panels</b> among <b>organizers</b> and participants in a dialogue process. To better understand this phenomenon is a subject for further research in the next round of dialogues and in other deliberative exercises. It would be of interest to deeper investigate these expectations and how they relate to the acceptance and the legitimacy of deliberative processes and its outcomes, especially when taking account of Parkinson’s (2003) summary of the academic debates about legitimacy in deliberative democracy: that legitimacy is a regulatory ideal, not a fixed point on a scale, and that ‘genuine legitimacy is built over time by the discursive, critical examination of institutions and their actions such that ‘people actually consider institutional arrangements to be in their interest’ and such that ‘institutional arrangements actually are in everyone’s interest”’ (p. 184).|$|R
