5|$|The common {{soldiers}} fought bravely at first, {{but they}} were saddled with low <b>pay</b> (<b>with</b> which they had to purchase their own food and medical care), ammunition shortages, and mixed equipment. Due to the pay system, there were no allotments for their families, who were, therefore, forced to follow their husbands/sons into the battle zones.

5|$|Bondfield {{had helped}} Mary Macarthur to found the National Federation of Women Workers (NFWW) in 1906. This {{organisation}} {{was dedicated to}} the unionisation of women, and by 1914 had more than 20,000 members. In 1915 Bondfield became NFWW's organising secretary. Together with Macarthur, Phillips and Susan Lawrence, she established the Central Committee for Women's Employment, which organised relief work for the female unemployed. Bondfield's investigations into workers' pay revealed considerable differences between the rates paid to men and to women, even for identical work. Through the NFWW she campaigned for a £1 a week starting minimum wage for women, whatever {{the nature of the}} work, and for equal <b>pay</b> <b>with</b> men for equal work.|$|E
5|$|In early November 1959, President Dwight D. Eisenhower's Secretary of Defense Neil H. McElroy {{selected}} Critchfield to be {{head of the}} Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. McElroy {{hoped that}} Critchfield {{would be able to}} fix the nation's trouble missile program, but Critchfield was reluctant to serve at the director's $19,000 salary. McElroy then offered to let Critchfield serve without <b>pay,</b> <b>with</b> the government paying only his expenses of $15 per day, while allowing Critchfield to continue to draw his Convair salary of around $40,000. Critchfield accepted this offer, but ran into a storm of political and media criticism over the conflict of interest involved in heading an agency that did $4 million worth of business with Convair each year. Critchfield then withdrew his name from consideration.|$|E
5|$|Ironically, the treason and {{defection}} of Dumouriez {{gave the}} Jacobins full scope {{to take control}} of the armies. Before Neerwinden, the army obeyed its commanders. Afterward, the representatives on mission were given extraordinary powers over army commanders. The generals might <b>pay</b> <b>with</b> their lives for defeat, but the real authority lay with the political operatives. Meanwhile, the new War Minister sent his agents to spy on the generals. These men were quick to report any complaint against officers, which could result in disgrace or execution. Elements of this system stayed in force even after Maximilien Robespierre was overthrown and guillotined.|$|E

5|$|With the {{introduction}} of the United States Motion Picture Production Code of 1930, and particularly its edicts concerning on-screen violence, Warners allowed Cagney a change of pace. They cast him in the comedy Blonde Crazy, again opposite Blondell. As he completed filming, The Public Enemy was filling cinemas with all-night showings. Cagney began to compare his <b>pay</b> <b>with</b> his peers, thinking his contract allowed for salary adjustments based on the success of his films. Warner Bros. disagreed, however, and refused to give him a raise. The studio heads also insisted that Cagney continue promoting their films, even ones he was not in, which he opposed. Cagney moved back to New York, leaving his brother Bill to look after his apartment.|$|E
