In Halo 3, players can carry single-use equipment power-ups that offer temporary offensive or defensive advantages. This system of single-use equipment is replaced in Reach by reusable and persistent armor abilities that remain with a character {{until they are}} replaced. The abilities are a jetpack; active camouflage; sprint; hologram, which creates a facsimile of the player running towards a target point; drop shield, which creates a bubble that heals those inside and protects them from {{a limited amount of}} damage; and armor lock, which immobilizes the player but grants invincibility for a brief <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> <b>When</b> playing as Covenant Elites, players also have access to an evade armor ability.|$|E

25|$|The 19th {{century in}} Slovakia was a {{turbulent}} <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> Slovaks began experiencing their national revival {{in the kingdom}} of Austria-Hungary. Romanticism of Jozef B.

Other important painters of the 19th century were mainly portraitists Vojtech Angyal, Dominik Skutecký (1849–1921), J. Štetka, E. Ballo, Jozef Hanula (1863–1944), landscapist Karol Miloslav Lehotský (1846–1915) and impressionists Maximilián Schurmann (1863–1944) and P. Kern.|$|E
25|$|The {{crime rate}} in the Bedouin sector in the Negev is {{among the highest in}} the country. To that end, a special police unit, codenamed Blimat Herum (lit. {{emergency}} halt), consisting of about 100 regular policemen, was founded in 2003 to fight crime in the sector. The Southern District of the Israel Police cited the rising crime {{rate in the}} sector as the reason for the unit's inauguration. The unit was founded after a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> regular police units conducted raids on Bedouin settlements to stop theft (especially car theft) and drug dealing.

25|$|The vast {{majority}} of the bog bodies that have been discovered date from the Iron Age, a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> peat bogs covered a much larger area of northern Europe. Many of these Iron Age bodies bear a number of similarities, indicating a known cultural tradition of killing and depositing these people in a certain manner. These Pre-Roman Iron Age peoples lived in sedentary communities, who had built villages, and whose society was hierarchical. They were agriculturalists, raising animals in captivity as well as growing crops. In some parts of northern Europe, they also hunted fish. Although independent of the Roman Empire, which dominated southern Europe at this time, the inhabitants traded with the Romans.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} series, Baldrick's {{attempts}} {{to raise his}} social status bring much lower results due to his much smaller intelligence. His most visible attempt is in the first episode, where he tries to marry Lord Edmund Blackadder as his bridesmaid (after Kate eloped). Fortunately, Baldrick still has enough intelligence left to admire Blackadder and clearly has desire to please him. Unfortunately, Edmund despises him and even fires him once. This great obstacle was removed for a short <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> Edmund was kidnapped by Prince Ludwig the Indestructible along with Lord Melchett, thus Baldrick {{was able to get}} into the royal court by becoming the Queen's personal pet. A few hours later he was murdered by Prince Ludwig along with Blackadder, Melchett, Queenie, Nursie, and Lord Percy.|$|E
25|$|Zeus, {{pressed by}} {{the cries of}} the hungry people and by the other deities who also heard their anguish, forced Hades to return Persephone. However, it was a rule of the Fates that whoever {{consumed}} food or drink in the Underworld was doomed to spend eternity there. Before Persephone was released to Hermes, who had been sent to retrieve her, Hades tricked her into eating pomegranate seeds, (either six or four according to the telling) which forced her to return to the underworld for some months each year. She was obliged to remain with Hades for six or four months (one month per seed) and lived above ground with her mother {{for the rest of the}} year. This left a long <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> Demeter was unhappy due to Persephone's absence, neglecting to cultivate the earth. When Persephone returned to the surface, Demeter became joyful and cared for the earth again.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemical}} and physical {{nature of the}} arthropod exoskeleton limits its ability to stretch or change shape as the animal grows. In some special cases, such as the abdomens of termite queens and honeypot ants means that continuous growth of arthropods is not possible. Therefore, growth is periodic and concentrated into a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> the exoskeleton is shed, called moulting or ecdysis, which is {{under the control of}} a hormone called ecdysone. Moulting is a complex process that is invariably dangerous for the arthropod involved. Before the old exoskeleton is shed, the cuticle separates from the epidermis through a process called apolysis. New cuticle is excreted by the underlying epidermis, and mineral salts are usually withdrawn from the old cuticle for re-use. After the old cuticle is shed, the arthropod typically pumps up its body (for example, by air or water intake) to allow the new cuticle to expand to a larger size: the process of hardening by dehydration of the cuticle then takes place. A newly molted arthropod typically is pale in colour; in that state it is said to be teneral or a callow. It generally darkens or otherwise gains colour as its exoskeleton hardens.|$|E

25|$|Clews’ {{was born}} into a reputable New York family that was well-connected in Newport society. His father Henry Clews was a {{well-known}} and wealthy Wall Street investment banker. His mother Lucy Madison Worthington was a relative of US President James Madison and a direct descendent of American Revolutionary War brigadier general Andrew Lewis. One of Clews' aunts was married into the Vanderbilt family and another into the Astor family. Clews’ older sister Dr. Elsie Worthington Clews Parsons became a renowned anthropologist, author and activist, with three university degrees, including a Masters and a Doctorate from Columbia. During the same <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> his 1-year-older sister was achieving academic success, Clews himself failed at three successive universities {{by the time he was}} 20 years old, having been expelled from Amherst College, dropping out of philosophy at Columbia and then thrown out of the University of Hanover in Germany. Clews then joined the family financial firm under the tutelage of his father, but that business held no long-term future for his artistic sensibilities. Clews was married in 1901 to divorced New York socialite Louise Morris Gebhard but that marriage also ended in divorce. Clews’ second wife Marie had been previously married to a wealthy Newport businessman from a prominent and wealthy family and was herself born into a prominent family. Henry and Marie met at a New York social function and married in 1914, moved to Paris shortly afterwards and then found their home at the medieval French Riviera chateau when living with their young son in Paris during the First World War became too difficult. During their two decades together in residence at the chateau, in addition to the reconstruction and the creation of art, they also hosted elaborate parties for European society and American expatriates. The local villagers were not forgotten by the Clews, who built a fisherman’s beach with harbour and arranged for religious services and other events on the chateau grounds for people in the town. When Henry died in 1937 the funeral procession included virtually the entire village.|$|E
