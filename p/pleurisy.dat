Its main beliefs (expressed in a creed of eight articles of faith) and practices are nearly identical with those of most Evangelical and Pentecostal groups, with a special focus on miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit and proselytism. In the late 1990s the church was embroiled in many trials (often {{on the grounds of}} defamation or for financial issues), losing most of them. In 2006 a sex scandal within the church led the federation to be dissolved, and the church in Besançon became independent.|$|E

40|$|The {{values of}} a number of {{biochemical}} markers in serum and pleural fluid (PF) were compared in 30 patients with tuberculous, malignant, or metapneumonic pleural effusions and hydrothorax.

The effusion/serum (E/S) ratio was calculated for each indicator. The high levels of TG, β-LP, and SFMCs were found to be specific to tuberculous effusions. Malignant effusions exhibited a low content of C and a high level of NO metabolites and a G concentration greater than that in the serum (E/S ratio > 1. 0).

Our prospective study evaluated the accuracy of pleural NTs [nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin 3 (nT 3) and 4 (nT 4) ] levels for differentiating benign from malignant pleural exudates. Levels of NTs were measured by ELISA in 170 patients with non-neutrophilic (< 50 %) exudative benign or malignant <b>pleurisies</b> diagnosed by pleuroscopy. Fifty-nine benign (9 infections and 50 inflammatory diseases) and 111 malignant (50 extrathoracic tumors, 51 lung cancers and 10 mesotheliomas) pleural exudates were diagnosed by thoracoscopy. Levels of BDNF were significantly higher in malignant than in benign effusions [17 pg/ml (0 - 367) vs. 8 pg/ml (0 - 51), p< 0. 05]. ROC analysis showed an area under the curve of 0. 609 (p= 0. 012; best threshold 44 pg/ml).

40|$|Pleural {{tuberculosis}} (PL-TB) remains {{difficult to}} diagnose. An {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) was developed based on a construction containing the fusion of the Rv 3019 c (MT 10. 3) and Rv 1980 c (MPT 64) gene sequences, and its performance was evaluated {{in an area where}} TB is endemic. A total of 92 pleural fluid (PF) samples at serial dilutions of 1 : 50 to 1 : 800 were included in the ELISA IgA MT 10. 3 -MPT 64 evaluation: 70 from TB patients and 22 from patients with other <b>pleurisies.</b> Confirmation of the expression and subsequent purification of the protein was made by SDS-PAGE and Western blot assays, resulting in a 36 -kDa protein. ELISA IgA MT 10. 3 -MPT 64 showed sensitivities of 61. 4 %, 58. 6 %, 62. 9 %, 67. 1 %, and 70 % at each PF dilution, respectively. The cumulative results of all dilutions increased sensitivity to 81. 4 % without jeopardizing specificity. Similar results were also obtained at the combined dilutions of 1 : 50, 1 : 200, and 1 : 800 or 1 : 50 plus 1 : 800 dilutions (80 %). The overall sensitivity of the reference test, i. e., histopathological examination, was 74 %. But, via the ELISA IgA MT 10. 3 -MPT 64 test, sensitivity was high for specimens with a negative culture (23 / 27; 85. 2 %) or nonspecific histopathology (17 / 18; 94. 4 %). Our findings demonstrated the promising use of this test as an adjunct in PL-TB diagnoses, particularly in cases with lower bacterial loads and false-negative results in the reference tests, since the new test includes such important features as quick and easy application, high sensitivity and, perhaps most importantly, affordability, which is so crucial for its widespread use in developing countries...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundSeveral {{studies have}} already {{addressed}} the potential {{role of an}} increased fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18 F FDG) uptake in identification of pleural malignancy. In this pilot study, we investigate the role of 18 F-FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for differentiating asbestos-related benign pleural disease from malignant mesothelioma. Materials and MethodsThe study population comprised 31 consecutive patients (17 malignant mesotheliomas, nine benign asbestos <b>pleurisies,</b> and five diffuse pleural fibrosis) {{with a mean age}} of 61 years between January 2006 and December 2008. Thoracoscopy or image-guided pleural needle biopsy were systematically performed to reveal pathologic diagnosis and/or clinical follow-up for at least 3 years for presence or absence of malignant pleural effusion. ROCs analyses for standardized uptake value (SUV) adjusted to body weight were calculated between benign and malignant pleural diseases. Results 18 F-FDG PET/CT imaging correctly detected the presence of malignancies in 15 of 17 patients with malignant mesothelioma for sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of 88. 2 %, 92. 9 %, and 90. 3 %, respectively. 18 F-FDG PET/CT imaging correctly identified 13 of 14 cases of benign pleural disease. The mean SUV values were 6. 5 ± 3. 4 for malignant mesothelioma cases and 0. 8 ± 0. 6 for benign pleural diseases (p < 0. 001). When we compared the two groups of pleural disease, a cut-off value of 2. 2 for SUV gave the best accuracy with 94. 1 %, 100 %, 100 %, and 93. 3 % for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, respectively. ConclusionPreliminary results of this trial provide evidence that 18 F-FDG PET/CT imaging is a highly accurate and reliable noninvasive test to decide for further investigation of differentiating malignant mesothelioma from benign pleural disease...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevalence}} of <b>pleurisies</b> recorded at slaughter is increasing in Sweden, and acute outbreaks of actinobacillosis that require antimicrobial treatments {{have become more}} frequent. As an increased use of antimicrobials may result {{in the development of}} antimicrobial resistance it is essential to develop alternative measures to control the disease. Vaccinations present an appealing alternative to antimicrobial treatments. The aim of this work was to evaluate the potential of two different vaccination strategies in a specialized fattening herd affected by actinobacillosis. Methods The study was conducted in a specialized fattening herd employing age segregated rearing in eight units. The herd suffered from infections caused by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 2, confirmed by necropsy and serology. The study included 54 batches of pigs grouped into five periods. Batches of pigs of the second period were vaccinated against actinobacillosis twice, and pigs in the fourth period were vaccinated three times. Batches of pigs of the first, third and fifth period were not vaccinated. Concentrations of serum antibodies to A. pleuropneumoniae and serum amyloid A (SAA) were analysed and production data were recorded. Results Despite vaccinating, medical treatments were required to reduce the impact of the disease. The mean incidence of individual treatments for respiratory diseases during the rearing period ranged from 0 to 4. 7 ± 1. 8 %, and was greatest during the triple vaccination period (period IV; p A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 2 {{in the absence of a}} SAA-response. The {{prevalence of}} pleuritis decreased from 25. 4 ± 6. 5 % in the first period to 5. 0 ± 3. 7 % in the fifth period (p Conclusions The vaccine did not effectively prevent clinical expression of A. pleuropneumoniae infections, but seroconversion to A. pleuropneumoniae in the absence of a SAA-response in a large number pigs indicated that the vaccine had activated the immune system. Further, the prevalence of pleuritis decreased with time. This indicates that vaccinations together with intensified medical treatments of affected pigs could be useful in reducing the impact of A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 2 infections. </p...|$|R
