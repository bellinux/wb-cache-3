50|$|The Eye-Level and AE Finders are {{the basic}} {{eye-level}} <b>prism</b> <b>finders,</b> similar to most other SLR systems' <b>prism</b> <b>finders.</b> Both include a hot shoe for on-camera flash, or attachments to remotely trigger the shutter. Both also include an integral eyepiece shutter, which closes over the eyepiece to prevent light leakage during long exposures.|$|R
50|$|The Miranda {{cameras were}} {{equipped}} with a double lensmount consisting of a wide 44mm internal thread and an external bayonetâ€”the Pentax/Praktica screw mount is 42mm. The flange to film plane distance was deliberately made as short as possible to accommodate as many different makes of camera lenses as possible using separately-sold lens adapters. The detachable <b>finder</b> <b>prism</b> was set in a sliding mount. The lenses for the Miranda were at first supplied by either Zunow or Ofunar. However, {{by the end of}} the 1950s, Soligor became the main supplier, and soon the lenses were labelled Auto Miranda.|$|R
50|$|There {{is both a}} waist level finder and metered <b>prism</b> <b>finder</b> available. It has no {{removable}} film back, {{thus making}} the Kiev 60 design simpler and less prone to light leaks, which is sometimes {{a problem with the}} Kiev 88 design.|$|E
50|$|Some early SLRs {{featured}} a built-in CdS meter usually {{on the front}} {{left side of the}} top plate, as in the Minolta SR-7. Other manufacturers, such as Miranda and Nikon introduced a CdS prism which fitted to their interchangeable prism SLR cameras. Nikon's early Photomic finder utilized a cover in front of the cell which was raised and a reading was taken and the photographer would either turn the coupled shutter speed dial and/or the coupled aperture ring to center a galvanometer-based meter needle shown in the viewfinder. The disadvantage of this early Photomic <b>prism</b> <b>finder</b> was that the meter had no ON/OFF switch so the meter was constantly 'ON', thus draining battery power. A later Photomic housing had an ON/OFF switch on the Pentaprism. CdS light meters proved more sensitive to light and thus metering in available light situations was becoming more prominent and useful. Further advances in CdS sensitivity, however, were needed as, CdS cells suffered from a 'memory effect'. That is, if exposed to bright sunlight, the cell would require many minutes to return to normal operation and sensitivity.|$|E
50|$|The Canonflex was {{inspired}} to an extent by the company's rangefinder camera models. It has a thumb-operated wind-on lever on the camera's base and a removable meterless <b>finder</b> <b>prism,</b> which slides off after depressing {{a button on the}} left hand camera front. The rewind release is situated at the base. Long time exposure is accomplished by sliding a switch next to the shutter release to the left, before or while depressing the release button. It must be returned to terminate the exposure. At the right-hand camera front is a wide accessory shoe taking a selenium exposure meter, which couples to the shutter speed dial. The camera stayed in production for one year before it was replaced by the Canonflex R2000, adding the 1/2000 sec. shutter speed.|$|R
50|$|Tokyo Kogaku KK {{launched}} their first 35mm SLR camera in 1957, {{about two years}} before the Nikon F and the Canonflex. This was the Topcon R that acquired the bayonet lens mount from the Exakta Varex camera from Ihagee in Dresden, successor to the Kine Exakta of 1936. It was also inspired by the Zeiss Ikon Contax S as well as the Japanese Miranda T - most obviously the body shape by the former, and the detachable <b>finder</b> <b>prism</b> by the latter. However, it was not until 1963 the Topcon name became famous by introducing the Topcon RE Super, an event that took the entire camera industry by surprise: This camera featured through-the lens (TTL) exposure metering, and at full lens aperture at that. The RE Super was fully prepared for professional work supported by a choice of lenses and accessories to complement it. The United States importer was the Charles Beseler Company and it was sold as the Beseler Topcon Super D.|$|R
