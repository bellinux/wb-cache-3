2500|$|Despite being {{without a}} label and, seemingly, out of favour the band never stopped writing and {{recording}} in their Barkby Road studio. During 1994 they recorded {{more than four}} albums worth of material, some of which would not be released for many years. Another independent record label, <b>Permanent</b> <b>Records</b> stepped in and, in 1995, they released FreakGene, their fourth album. Belinda Carlisle later recorded a cover of [...] "I See No Ships" [...] from the album. Geoff Beavan had left the band prior to recording this album {{and was replaced by}} Ian Michie. The band left <b>Permanent</b> <b>Records</b> after the album's release, and retreated back to Leicester to continue writing and recording.|$|E
2500|$|De Forest was {{convinced}} {{there was a}} great future in radiotelegraphic communication (then known as [...] "wireless telegraphy"), but Italian Guglielmo Marconi, who received his first patent in 1896, was already making impressive progress in both Europe and the United States. One drawback to Marconi's approach was his use of a coherer as a receiver, which, while providing for <b>permanent</b> <b>records,</b> was also slow (after each received Morse code dot or dash, it had to be tapped to restore operation), insensitive, and not very reliable. De Forest was determined to devise a better system, including a self-restoring detector that could receive transmissions by ear, thus making it capable of receiving weaker signals and also allowing faster Morse code sending speeds.|$|E
2500|$|A new album, Sounds {{from the}} Other Side, was {{released}} on 27 September 2013 by the <b>Permanent</b> <b>Records</b> label and distributed by Shock Records. Pete Laurie of theMusic website found [...] "isn't about reinventing the wheel, but it never sounds like a lazy rehash of {{the good old days}} either". Lewis explained to The Ages Martin Boulton [...] "We got to a point after the re-formation where we decided not to put an end date on it [...] we said we can't keep playing that same period [...] {{for the rest of our}} lives [...] While we love it and we know our fans love it â€¦ in order to be a relevant, creative unit [...] for our own personal satisfaction more than anything, we've got to try writing again and doing something new together and that's been really interesting and amazing". The group announced an Australian tour to promote the album during November and December 2013.|$|E

2500|$|On May 28, 2009, the Memphis Commercial Appeal {{obtained}} the letter through the Freedom of Information Act and released it. Although the player's name was redacted due to privacy laws, process of elimination, and sources revealed the player as Derrick Rose. The next day, {{in a separate}} investigation, James Sullivan, Inspector General of the Chicago Public Schools district's Board of Education, released a report of his investigation stating that four student-athletes of a CPS school had one-month grade boosts to alter their college transcripts. The Chicago Sun-Times revealed the school as Simeon Career Academy and {{that three of the}} four were Rose and his former teammates Kevin Johnson and Tim Flowers, prominent members of the back-to-back championship teams. The newspaper claimed that Rose's grade was changed from a D to a C. Another part of the report stated that [...] "high school staff lost the original <b>permanent</b> <b>records</b> for three of the above mentioned students athletes" [...] (including the unknown four). Sullivan started the investigation because [...] "none of the grade changes were supported by any documentation." [...] He also failed to find a suspect as [...] "at least seven people at Simeon had the ability to access student grades and records." [...] Illinois High School Association (IHSA) executive director Marty Hickman reacted by saying, [...] "It is obvious that this is worth taking a look into." [...] Robert Smith, who coached the Wolverines from 2004 to 2007, denied any wrongdoing. District spokeswoman Monique Bond said the students involved probably did not know about the grade change.|$|E
60|$|It must {{be remembered}} that the {{literature}} of the old Israelites, as it lies before us, has been subjected to the revisal of strictly monotheistic editors, violently opposed to all kinds of idolatry, who are not likely to have selected from the materials at their disposal any obvious evidence, either of the practice under discussion, or of that ancestor-worship which is so closely related to it, for preservation in the <b>permanent</b> <b>records</b> of their people.|$|E
6000|$|There is {{yet another}} {{difference}} which we may point out: savages have no literature. They cannot read or write therefore, and have no <b>permanent</b> <b>records</b> of the deeds of their forefathers. Neither have they any religion worthy of the name. This is indeed a serious evil, one which civilised people of course deplore, yet, strange to say, one which consistency prevents some civilised people from remedying {{in the case of}} African savages, for it would be absurdly inconsistent in Arab Mohammedans to teach the negroes letters and the doctrines of their faith with one hand, while with the other they lashed them to death or dragged them into perpetual slavery; and it would be equally inconsistent in Portuguese Christians to teach the negroes to read [...] "Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so to them," [...] while [...] "domestic slavery" [...] is, in their so-called African territories, claimed as a right and the traffic connected with it sanctioned.|$|E

60|$|On {{our return}} to Maldonado, we {{followed}} rather a different line of road. Near Pan de Azucar, a landmark {{well known to}} all those who have sailed up the Plata, I stayed a day at the house of a most hospitable old Spaniard. Early in the morning we ascended the Sierra de las Animas. By the aid of the rising sun the scenery was almost picturesque. To the westward the view extended over an immense level plain as far as the Mount, at Monte Video, and to the eastward, over the mammillated country of Maldonado. On the summit of the mountain there were several small heaps of stones, which evidently had lain there for many years. My companion assured me that they were the work of the Indians in the old time. The heaps were similar, but on a much smaller scale, to those so commonly found on the mountains of Wales. The desire to signalise any event, on the highest point of the neighbouring land, seems a universal passion with mankind. At the present day, not a single Indian, either civilised or wild, exists {{in this part of the}} province; nor am I aware that the former inhabitants have left behind them any more <b>permanent</b> <b>records</b> than these insignificant piles on the summit of the Sierra de las Animas.|$|E
60|$|Nearly all {{the great}} exploits, and {{achievements}} too, which have signalized {{the history of the}} world, have been performed by this branch of the human family. They have given celebrity to every age in which they have lived, and to every country that they have ever possessed, by some great deed, or discovery, or achievement, which their intellectual energies have accomplished. As Egyptians, they built the Pyramids, and reared enormous monoliths, which remain as perfect now as they were when first completed, thirty centuries ago. As Ph[oe]nicians, they constructed ships, perfected navigation, and explored, without compass or chart, every known sea. As Greeks, they modeled architectural embellishments, and cut sculptures in marble, and wrote poems and history, which have been ever since the admiration of the world. As Romans, they carried a complete and perfect military organization over fifty nations and a hundred millions of people, with one supreme mistress over all, the ruins of whose splendid palaces and monuments have not yet passed away. Thus has this race gone on, always distinguishing itself, by energy, activity, and intellectual power, wherever it has dwelt, whatever language it has spoken, and in whatever period of the world it has lived. It has invented printing, and filled every country that it occupies with <b>permanent</b> <b>records</b> of the past, accessible to all. It has explored the heavens, and reduced to precise and exact calculations all the complicated motions there. It has ransacked the earth, systematized, arranged, and classified the vast melange of plants, and animals, and mineral products to be found upon its surface. It makes steam and falling water do more than half the work necessary for feeding and clothing the human race; and the howling winds of the ocean, the very emblems of resistless destruction and terror, it steadily employs in interchanging the products of the world, and bearing the means of comfort and plenty to every clime.|$|E
