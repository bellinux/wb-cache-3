50|$|The <b>plain</b> <b>xenops</b> (Xenops minutus) is a {{passerine}} bird which breeds in moist lowland {{forests in}} the tropical New World from southern Mexico south to western Ecuador, northeastern Argentina and central Brazil.|$|E
50|$|However, <b>plain</b> <b>xenops</b> simply places {{shredded}} plant fibres {{in a hole}} between 1.5 and 9 m high in a decaying {{tree trunk}} or branch. The normal clutch is two white eggs, incubated by both sexes. This species is a resident breeder in forest habitats.|$|E
50|$|Protected species include white-necked hawk (Buteogallus lacernulatus), oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus), black-cheeked gnateater (Conopophaga melanops), rufous gnateater (Conopophaga lineata), buff-throated purpletuft (Iodopleura pipra), {{blue-crowned motmot}} (Momotus momota), {{scalloped}} antbird (Myrmeciza ruficauda), spot-winged wood quail (Odontophorus capueira), rusty-margined guan (Penelope superciliaris), golden-spangled piculet (Picumnus exilis), white-throated spadebill (Platyrinchus mystaceus) and <b>plain</b> <b>xenops</b> (Xenops minutus).|$|E
50|$|The <b>plain</b> <b>xenops</b> {{is often}} {{difficult}} to see as it forages for insects, including the larvae of wood-boring beetles, on bark, rotting stumps or bare twigs. It moves in all directions on the trunk like a treecreeper, but does not use its tail as a prop. It may be located by its sharp cheet call, or its song, a series of 5 or 6 trilled fit fit fit f’ f’f f’ notes. It regularly joins mixed-species feeding flocks.|$|E
50|$|The <b>plain</b> <b>xenops</b> is {{typically}} 12 cm long, weighs 12 g, {{and has a}} stubby wedge-shaped bill. The head is light brown with a buff supercilium and whitish malar stripe. The upperparts are brown, becoming rufous on the tail and rump, {{and there is a}} buff bar on the darker brown wings. The underparts are unstreaked pale olive brown. The sexes are similar, but young birds have dark brown throats. The lack of streaking is an obvious distinction from other xenops especially streaked xenops. It is also the only lowland species in the genus.|$|E
