50|$|<b>Pay</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>throw</b> is a {{model for}} pricing the {{disposal}} of municipal solid waste by unit of waste rather than by charging a uniform price for pickup and disposal. This acts as a tax on waste - the more waste a household produces, the more it will be charged for its disposal. <b>Pay</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>throw</b> is administered on the municipal level. The purpose behind this system is to discourage waste generation and to encourage recycling. By charging citizens per unit of waste, municipalities hope to discourage waste generation by causing households to consider the quantity of waste they are producing by making them pay for it. It is estimated that <b>pay</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>throw</b> programs have decreased municipal solid waste by about 17% in weight, with a 6% decrease attributed to source reduction efforts and an 8-11% due to waste diversion to recycling and yard programs. In 2006, <b>pay</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>throw</b> had been instituted in over 7,000 United States communities.|$|E
50|$|Another {{method of}} source {{reduction}} {{is to increase}} incentives for recycling. Many communities in the United States are implementing variable-rate pricing for waste disposal (also known as <b>Pay</b> <b>As</b> <b>You</b> <b>Throw</b> - PAYT) which has been effective in reducing {{the size of the}} municipal waste stream.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pay</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>throw</b> (PAYT) (also called trash metering, unit pricing, {{variable}} rate pricing, or user-pay) is a usage-pricing model for disposing of municipal solid waste. Users are charged a rate {{based on how}} much waste they present for collection to the municipality or local authority.|$|E

5000|$|Pilot {{programs}} {{are commonly used}} as a mechanism for determining prospective infrastructure investments and educational tactics including, [...] "collection containers, vehicles, outreach needs, processing needs {{and the impact of}} neighborhoods with different demographics." [...] In 1999, San Francisco and Recology rolled out their most recent pilot, a dedicated color-coded cart system called the Fantastic Three. [...] The color-coded cart system was designed to make recycling and composting easy for residents, with each color signifying the type of materials accepted (blue=recycling, green=organics, black=landfill). The Fantastic Three also integrated financial incentives for participation. The program's <b>pay</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>throw</b> framework allowed residents and businesses to reap savings as their trash volumes decreased. [...] Within seven months, the Fantastic Three, helped to increase diversion by more than 90 percent amongst participating businesses and residents and generated a 73 percent satisfaction rating. [...] With this success rate, Recology in collaboration with the City, invested in a plan to further expand the program.|$|E
5000|$|The {{economic}} costs of managing waste are high, {{and are often}} paid for by municipal governments; money can often be saved with more efficiently designed collection routes, modifying vehicles, and with public education. Environmental policies such as <b>pay</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>throw</b> can {{reduce the cost of}} management and reduce waste quantities. Waste recovery (that is, recycling, reuse) can curb {{economic costs}} because it avoids extracting raw materials and often cuts transportation costs. [...] "Economic assessment of municipal waste management systems - case studies using a combination of life-cycle assessment (LCA) and life-cycle costing (LCC)". The location of waste treatment and disposal facilities often reduces property values due to noise, dust, pollution, unsightliness, and negative stigma. The informal waste sector consists mostly of waste pickers who scavenge for metals, glass, plastic, textiles, and other materials and then trade them for a profit. This sector can significantly alter or reduce waste in a particular system, but other negative economic effects come with the disease, poverty, exploitation, and abuse of its workers.|$|E
50|$|In 1989, Vittori {{proposed}} {{a conceptual framework}} for what evolved as the City of Austin’s Green Building Program, the only U.S. program recognized at the 1992 U.N. Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, and the first green building program in the world. Along with Pliny Fisk, she oversaw the program’s early stage development through 1992. Austin’s Green Builder Program influenced {{the formation of the}} U.S. Green Building Council and LEED, in addition to scores of policies throughout the U.S. and abroad. Additionally, from 1988 to 1998, she served on the City’s Solid Waste Advisory Commission, six of those years as founding chair, a committee formed in response to a successful initiative co-coordinated by Vittori to cancel a proposed waste-to-energy municipal solid waste incinerator. Her work on establishing <b>pay</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>throw</b> recycling residential programs, in addition to recycling programs for the City’s commercial and multi-family sectors, has led Austin to having one of the nation’s most successful recycling programs. Her work in this area continues with promoting zero waste by 2040, adopted by the Austin City Council in January 2009. Vittori is on the advisory boards of Natural Home magazine and Environmental Building News.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates “how is the <b>Pay</b> <b>As</b> <b>You</b> <b>Throw</b> (PAYT) {{principle}} {{viewed by}} housing estates in HK {{and how are}} they preparing for its possible implementation”. A multiple case study approach is adopted. The research findings are based on five case studies with in-depth interviews with the respective property managers and site visits to the housing estates. Based on the data analysis of the research, four findings are highlighted. First, Environmental management system is the trend for property management companies to adopt in order to upgrade their quality of service in Hong Kong. Second, Hong Kong housing estates are willing to join the programmes related to waste recovery and reduction which are organized by EPD and charitable organizations. Third, the quantity-based charging system {{is regarded as the}} fairest system; however, the property managers have the greatest reservation on its implementation. Finally, there is a dilemma of role conflict between the enforcement of law and the provision of customer service. Four recommendations are suggested to be put in place alongside the future waste charging policy. Mandatory participation with comprehensive recycling scheme should be adopted. Measures against illegal dumpling and environmental education for the public should be simultaneously worked out to complement the waste charging policies as well. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|E
40|$|This Master's degree work {{discusses}} {{possibilities of}} implementing new waste treatment billing system known as PAYT (<b>Pay</b> <b>As</b> <b>You</b> <b>Throw),</b> that enables charging based on actually collected quantity of waste. Thus {{the system of}} covering waste treatment costs is adapted to the principle »POLUTERS PAY« as close as possible. We have analyzed the working process of Municipal Public Company, responsible for waste management {{in the area of}} 5 Communities in central part of Slovenia. The emphasis of analytic procedure has been put on Waste Treatment Cost Structure. We have determined the costs that are inevitable for working process, but not influenced by the quantity of collected waste. The values of fixed and variable costs are a basis for Basic Charge and Service Charges (price depending on number of waste bin collections per month) for waste treatment. Procedure for identification of collected bins is enabled by using RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) data collection system. Identification is basic requirement for introducing collection measurement or weighing of collected waste in waste collection process. RFID transponder is installed in waste collection bin. RFID reader installed on Refuse Collection Vehicle reads and transmits the transponder serial numbers. The tag data, combined with the time and GPS data (+ weight in weighing option) is recorded to the process unit in RCV.

40|$|Few {{environmental}} problems exemplify market-failure better than {{municipal solid waste}} does: A direct by-product of economic production and consumption, its collection and disposal (still mainly at landfills, in many countries) incurs high capital and running costs, creates environmental and health impacts and, in European Union countries, risks incurring heavy financial penalties. The main remedy proposed in environmental economics is a marginal tax on the disposal of mixed household waste, intended to incentivise its reduction and separation for recycling. But taxes are politically unpopular, expensive to administer and generate variable response − sometimes stimulating illegal disposal of waste instead of its reduction. Taxes also risk undermining the moral benefits people seem to enjoy from cooperating voluntarily. Inducing voluntary cooperation could cultivate moral motives and generate cooperation, but this has received less attention in environmental economics to date. The aim of this thesis {{is to examine the}} determinants of cooperation by households in waste management activities, investigating the role that government policy can play in stimulating it, and focusing on the role of price incentives and of scheme promotion. Chapter 1 introduces the issue of waste management as an economic problem, and the role of household cooperation as a promising solution. Chapter 2 surveys the literature on the topic of what determines household cooperation in waste management and identifies the key gaps which the thesis seeks to address. Three manuscripts are presented in Chapters 3, 4 and 5, each of which examines a distinct question on the determinants of household cooperation in waste management. Chapter 6 concludes with a synthesis of main findings, key policy cues and suggestions for future research. The first manuscript titled “Voluntary recycling despite financial disincentives” employs a unique merged panel data set (n = 4, 644) using data from 58 localities over 86 weeks to assess the determinants of participation in a voluntary waste separation scheme in Malta. The two manuscripts that follow are based on a nationally-representative telephone survey (n = 1, 037), containing two embedded experiments, and conducted during 2013, in Malta, for this thesis. Manuscript 2 titled “Partisanship, priming and participation in voluntary recycling” tests whether party identification, as distinct from environmental or political ideology, can act as a determinant of participation in a recycling scheme, particularly if the scheme is promoted in a manner that associates it with the party in government. Manuscript 3 titled “The impact of a <b>Pay</b> <b>as</b> <b>You</b> <b>Throw</b> tax level and label on home-composting” examines the potential of a <b>Pay</b> <b>As</b> <b>You</b> <b>Throw</b> (PAYT) tax, and of its labelling, to induce substitution of biodegradable waste away from mixed kerb-side disposal and into home-composting. It also examines the prospect that this type of intervention stimulates illegal disposal. Synthesising the results of three studies, the thesis finds that: 1. 	The type of households most likely to cooperate in waste management schemes are multiple-person ones facing lower constraints of space and time, where members hold pro-environmental preferences. This confirms findings of similar studies in other contexts, helps forecast uptake and may guide the design and promotion of schemes to target low-lying fruit and tackle relevant constraints. 2. 	Driven mainly by moral motives, households are willing to recycle voluntarily even if it is less convenientc e than disposing of un-separated waste, and they {{are willing to pay for}} it. This is a useful finding for municipalities with low budgets, unable to institute taxes or fearing illegal disposal as a reaction. 3. 	Political preferences are relevant to recycling: Where negative sentiment towards the party in government exists, (even subtle cues) promoting the scheme as a government scheme and associating it with the party in government can suppress participation. Decoupling political communication from scheme promotion can release more households into cooperative effort. 4. 	Responses to waste taxes are not just a matter of price level but also of tax salience: A tax label can significantly increase waste separation and home-composting but it also boosts higher illegal-disposal intent. The way a fee is labelled therefore itself forms part of the intervention tool-kit, meriting pre-testing and capable of manipulation. These findings make a marginal contribution to gaps in the environmental economics literature by integrating insights from psychology. They are also intended to offer simple and applicable ideas to policy-makers and to scheme-operators aiming to increase household cooperation in waste management...|$|E
40|$|Local {{municipalities}} in the United States {{are increasingly}} {{concerned about how}} and {{where we are going}} to dispose of our trash without generating unmanageable costs. The phenomena of increasing land prices, stricter national environmental protection regulations and landowners that are unwillingly to live next to a dump are forcing costs through the roof, in turn, this is draining municipal budgets which are not prepared for the changing solid waste industry. These fiscal drains and stiffening regulation are forcing local legislators to modify {{the way in which they}} treat solid waste disposal. Cities and towns are setting up systems that treat waste as a utility that is paid for incrementally and based on usage. This report provides a broad overview of the solid waste disposal in the United States including a brief history, and a synopsis of solid waste disposal policies at the national and state level. Long-term solid waste management concerns and a discussion of current programmatic trends (including Enterprise Funds, <b>Pay</b> <b>As</b> <b>You</b> <b>Throw</b> (PAYT) systems) and complementary services (such as recycling and green waste pickup) are discussed in detail. The City of Tucson’s solid waste policies are used as a framework for the possible restructuring of the smaller municipality, the City of South Tucson’s Sanitation Services. Current sanitation practice in the City of South Tucson and preliminary findings for the FY 2002 - 03 Sanitation Services cost benefit analysis demonstrate the need for in-depth documentation of all revenues and expenditures. Programmatic and fiscal recommendations for the City of South Tucson include the tracking of all Sanitation Services revenues and expenditures (Base Study), the formation of a self-standing Sanitation Services enterprise fund, the implementation of once a week trash pick up with the integration of complementary services (recycling and green waste), and the eventual implementation of a Pay-As-You-Throw fiscal program. It is recommended that these fiscal and programmatic changes be actuated on an incremental basis, which is dependent on the findings of the Sanitation Services Base Study. An in-depth understanding of the long and short-term solid waste issues will guide the Mayor and Council of the City of South Tucson in making an informed decision on potential policy changes that could enhance the current program while ensuring the program’s fiscal accountability...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{undertook a}} critical review of four recycling policies used in Ontario which are designed to promote household waste diversion and reduce material management costs. These policies include: 1) Municipal funding should be directly tied to program performance relative to their peer group. 2) All municipalities should make investments in recycling promotion and education, and will be reimbursed 1 per household for all recycling promotion and education expenditures 3) Where possible, municipalities should implement <b>pay</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>throw</b> schemes for household waste {{as a means to}} minimize the amount of material being disposed of in the waste stream. 4) Where possible, municipalities should opt for single stream collection and processing of household recyclables Using a combination of recycling data spanning the past 12 years for each of Ontario’s 223 obligated municipalities and semi structured interviews with recycling stakeholders, the aforementioned recycling best practices were evaluated using three criteria: 1) the ability to increase waste diversion 2) the ability to contain costs and 3) perception and attitudes among recycling stakeholders (do they think the policy is working). None of the four recycling best practices tested were able to satisfy all three criteria. Stakeholder perceptions and attitudes towards the best practice policies were mixed. Given that the recycling best practices tested in this study failed to achieve their intended objectives, I then proposed alternative systems that could be characterized as a radical departure from the existing system. This was done to call into question the appropriateness of having “increased diversion” as the focal point of policy objectives in the province. In these alternative systems, I propose a “contraction” of the existing Blue Box program – Using a systems based cost model, focus was placed on analyzing whether recycling programs should be offered in rural and northern communities. The results of this analysis demonstrated that eliminating recycling programs in high cost regions significantly decreased system costs without negatively impacting overall recycling rates. The second alternative system considered in this study examines how changing the mix of materials accepted in Ontario 2 ̆ 7 s residential recycling program affects provincial material management costs and recycling rates. The results of the cost model analysis show that removing non-core materials from the Blue Box program significantly decreased system costs without negatively impacting overall recycling rates. Ultimately, it was found {{that it was possible to}} increase the provincial recycling rate while simultaneously reducing program costs by targeting specific materials for recover...|$|E
